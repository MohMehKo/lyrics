If I was strong enough
I'd carry you home through the storm,
But I'm not enough, you see
And if I could
I would be your long lasting love for sea,
But I'd be drowning there, you see
I am not enough, you see [x3]

If I was strong enough
I'd carry you home through the storm,
But I'm not enough, you see
And if I could I would took you,
In each night, sing you, to sleep
Until you can find relief
But I am not about to risk
No I am not that strong, you see
I am not enough, you see...
