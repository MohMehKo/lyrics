That little devil in my back says
That there's nothing that I can't do
That he is gonna put me on the right track
And I will never belong to you

I've seen the clothing in his closet
That I believe I'm supposed to wear
I'm like the water in his faucet:
Floating with his despair

I hear them say that it's always been like this,
With angels living on the ground
I know that the reason they drop their wings
Is you

That little devil in my back says
He can change all the things I've been
He is gonna put me on the right track
If I just open the door and let him in

Now someone save me from his arms
By being who I adore
Then he can't break me with his charms,
Make me sleep on the hardwood floor

I hear you say that it's alright now;
He is gone
You know I fell and hit the ground
He knows that the reason I dropped my wings is you

And I hear them say that it's always been like this;
With angels living on the ground
I know that the reason they drop their wings
Is you

That little devil in my back says
That there's nothing that I can't do
That he is gonna put me on the right track
That I will never belong to you
