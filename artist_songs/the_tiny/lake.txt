If I have lost my mind
I don't care 

I'm going all the way
With no fear

My life in your embrace
Maybe we can stay here
Until the end of days, lose track of time

You'll find me floating in the middle of the lake
That's where I'm calm
That's where your love can reach me
Though you're gone
You will find me floating in the middle of the lake
That's where I'm calm
That's where your love can reach me
Though you're gone

Maybe I've lost my mind
I don't care

I'm going all the way
With no fear

My life in your embrace
Maybe we can stay here
Until the end of days, lose track of time

That lower horizontal line before my eyes is rising
Shivering
Falling 

You'll find me floating in the middle of the lake
That's where I'm calm
That's where your love can reach me
Though you're gone
You will find me floating in the middle of the lake
That's where I'm calm
That's where your love can reach me
Though you're gone

Though you're gone
