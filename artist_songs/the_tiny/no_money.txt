No money left for me
I spent it all on things

No money left for you
I spent it all on things
Must be I've lost what sense I had
When I bought all those things

Now no money left for me
I've spent it on things
That I don't need

It wasn't me

I got this letter yesterday
It said I hadn't paid
My rent, my phone
My car, my loan I didn't know I had

But no money left for them
I spent it on things I don't need
And still there's no money
Left for me
I must have lost what sense I had

It wasn't me
It wasn't me

No money
No money
No money
No money
