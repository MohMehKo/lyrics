I look in your eyes
They're leading me down to
Down to your skies

All stars lose their glow there
Always betrayed by the doors to
Your eyes

I follow his hand
It's leading me down to
Down to the land

Wildflowers can't grow there
Always betrayed the doors to
The scam

I see it's here again
Soon you'll be gone
I see your window across the yard
Where I come from
