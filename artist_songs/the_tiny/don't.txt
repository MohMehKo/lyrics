Welcome me with open arms
Build me up, I'll make you calm
Don't disturb the silence 
Of the loneliness I have inside of me

Rock my cradle, help me sleep
Hold me close when I may weep
But don't you waste your precious time
And think you'll reach me through my mind

That is, don't you love me
Cause I'll never catch you if you fall
Don't you even speak of love
I said I don't recall

Be here for me and care for me
Help me see I won't disagree
But then when I have framed your mind
I'll make it worse by being kind

So don't you love me
Cause I'll never catch you if you fall
Don't you even speak of love
I said I don't recall

Don't you love me
Cause I'll never catch your fall
Don't you even speak of love
I said I don't recall

I said I don't recall

Love
