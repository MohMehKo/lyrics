Opened up your door
Though you may find it to be scary
I don't intend to catch your heart

Then open up your dreams
Though you may find them to be frightening
I don't intend to catch your eyes

I'm reaching for your cliff top
I'm jumping off with grace
Finding out that this game, 
I'm the only one who plays

So I opened up my door
And yes, it seemed just like a fairy tale
But no one ever stays here alone

And I opened up my dreams
And yes, I found them to be frightening
And I'd only wish to stay here on my own

So I'm reaching for your cliff top
I'm jumping off with grace
And finding out that this game,
I'm the only one who plays

So, reaching for your ground
And jumping off with grace
And finding out that this game,
I'm the only one who plays
