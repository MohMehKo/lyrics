My friend got married last weekend
and I was there to witness 
as he filled his life with love
And everyone around him was dancing, 
laughing, getting drunk on champagne
And there was I, feeling lonely by your side
For you not being able to promise me a lifetime being true

Maybe that's just not the way for me and you,
But I would surely like to know what it feels like 
to not be afraid of losing you.

I could not stand losing you.
I could not stand to lose you.

Our friends got married last weekend 
And we were there to witness 
as they filled their life with magic
Everyone around them was dancing, 
laughing, getting drunk on champagne
And there were you, feeling lonely, just as me
For me not being able to promise you a lifetime being true

Maybe that's just not the way for me and you,
But I would surely like to know what it feels like 
to not be afraid of losing you.

I could not stand losing you.
I could not stand to lose you.

Could you stand to lose me?

I could not stand to lose you.
