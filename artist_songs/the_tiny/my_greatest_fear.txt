This is my fear
I'll never find you
My greatest fear
I'll never find you 

I can't remember the color of your eyes
though I can see them clearly
One thing I know for sure
is that they are wise
and I am yours
so sincerely yours

This is my fear
I'll never find you
My greatest fear
I'll never find you
