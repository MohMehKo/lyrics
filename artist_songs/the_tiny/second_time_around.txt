Gently tip-toeing down your spine
So I enter your beautiful mind

Move in slowly reaching your feet
If I could I would dance them to sleep
Feeding on the air that you breathe
As of now, it's all that I need

Take another exit this time
Take this time
Take another exit this time
Take

Now lean your head heavy head on my chest
Do I really tell you the rest?
Reach for the light switch, try to find me in here
Leave your eyelashes down
When we fall to the ground

Take another exit this time
Take another exit this time
Take this time
Take another exit this time
Take another this time
Take another exit this time
