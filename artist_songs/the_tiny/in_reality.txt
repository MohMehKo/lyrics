It Wasn't really me you saw that time
wasn't really tears that fell on my face
are you really sure that what you saw
couldn't just have been someone looking just like me?

It wasn't really love, so what the hell?
didn't really know you quiet that well
must be that you remind me of this dream
this dream is starring someone just like you

I know I don't know you in reality
though I would think that I could love someone like you, someone like you, someone just like you

It wasn't meant for you to hear me say
I fear that love would never come my way
That I would rather live my life alone
than find myself with buried dreams impressioned with someone just like you
