Just like a flower you need your drink
And no one in your way
Just as the water runs through your veins
It makes you go insane
But gets rid of all your pain

Just like a flower you need your sunlight
And no one in your way
Just as the radiation touch your skin
It makes you go insane
But gets rid of all your pain

Just like a flower you need your drink
And no one in your way
Just as the water runs through your veins
It makes you go insane
But get rid of all your pain

Just like a flower you try my heart
And you've never been betrayed
I know your phantoms, I know your pain
I can make them go away
But it'll make me go insane,
But get rid of all your pain
