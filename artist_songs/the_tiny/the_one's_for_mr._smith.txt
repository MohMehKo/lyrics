Lust has your gentle voice
It leaves your mouth 
And I stand still 
Awaits the sound

Just as your gentle voice 
Sways through my hair 
And finds its way 
Into my ear 

And there it stays 
It twists and turns 
It's sharing how 
Your heart it yearns

Dust has her gentle lies 
They float right through 
That hole someone 
Had left in you 

And there she stares 
And twists and turns 
She's sharing how 
Your heart it burns
