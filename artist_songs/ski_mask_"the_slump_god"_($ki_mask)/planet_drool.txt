Bitch!
If I go broke then I'ma bool with my tool
You pull your shit, I pull my shit and let them duel
This ain't no dream bitch, this ain't no planet drool
Don't be a fool
Just let me bool
If I go broke then I'ma bool with my tool
This ain't no beyblade, but bitch we gonna let them duel
This ain't no dream bitch, this ain't no planet drool
Don't be a fool
Just let me bool

5 hour bitch I need energy
To beat the pussy make melodies
I am the shit, know you smelling me
Don't fuck with John, fuck with Kennedy
I want a sub zero wrist
Put some ice up on that bitch
Chef Boyardee in the kitchen, beat the pot up with my fist
You, you can't test us
High as giraffe nuts
Smoke like molasses
I reside in the body of a bastard
Niggas try me then I Megaman blast them
Make or break that bitch
I look upon my wrist, and like a disc
That bitch is dancing, shine
[?]
Like the movie 'Taken' this bitch mine

[Xxxtentacion:]
Roll away the summer time do not wait for me
If I ever break, them fuck them
And fuck the state
Then baby sit down sit down
