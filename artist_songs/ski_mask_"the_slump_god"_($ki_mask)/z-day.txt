[$ki Mask:]
Parkinson, Parkinson, Parkinson
Wrist game on Parkinsons like I can't park again
Your girl is feeding me chocolate in Charlie's factory
Bitch you my moccasins
I then might cut out your arteries
I done smile at the thought of it
"I ate the heart of a Baphomet"
Is what I say when they ask what the start of this
Hickory, hickory, guns with the thickery
Just gave your ass an epiphany
Jewelry, jewelry, your jewelry foolery
Look like you got it from Tiffany
Ride on your bitch like a swing, wee!
I steady doing my thing, ee!
Checkmate me bitch I'm a king
She sucked me, R. Kelly, I sing

[Yung Simmie:]
I'm sending shots at your skeleton
Wrapping my flag, no Confederate
I pull up and my niggas pop at you
You talking, my niggas ain't hearing it
I'm from the city you better go get it
Or you gon' get left by yourself
I be fucking these bitches, no loving these bitches
The chopper is right on the shelf
I'm just a young nigga, I don't know these niggas
I came in the game by myself
And I am too cold, I won't sell my soul
Real nigga I'll never fold
My young niggas wylin', you slipping
They get you, you better be tucking your gold
My young niggas riding, they with me
We gooning and we sending shot at your dome

[Denzel Curry:]
Look at me looking luxury
Diamonds dancing it's the federation
I'm the overlord dressed in all black
And I'm balling no Voldemort
None of the sorcery could penetrate my forcefield
Lord willing, imperialism
Pistol popping on the crackers at the 181st Street Mall
Damn them crackers wanna see a nigga fall
No Niagara but the boy be flowing
Like a record spinning in the DJ Quik
Man the situations getting kinda thick
Can't envision niggas out here getting rich
Since you up, and you black and you innocent
[?] of significant, I wanna step my rich market
Banana clips when I'm busting
Curry the killer the nigga I'll shoot up your squad
