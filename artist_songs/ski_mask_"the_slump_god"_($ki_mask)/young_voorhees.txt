Like T.I.P, I got my hat slant on this bitch
Like Lebron headline, lets see a slant on this bitch
Shake and bake, shake and bake, shake and bake
Poke the holes, poke the holes, poke the holes
Shake and bake, aye

Feel like Frozone "where my super suit?"
My wrist cold
I can't hold that bitch like sipping soup up outta' bowl
Talking bout money better get right
Split Ya ass open like a fucking Klondike
Then I hit em wit a (huh huh) Suge Knight
Then I climb on his bitch like mountain bike, aye uh
Wrist piss
That's that Johnny Dang
Christmas, ho, ho, hoes up on my thang, aye aye
Hit this, lean, that's that good pint, aye
Girl you icky Vicky
I don't want your germs

Young Voorhees Sippin' porridge
Out of Versace bowls like a lord bitch
When I'm in the pussy I got Courage
That's why she ask for my hand in marriage
[x2]

"Pimp named slick back" Bitch back back
You need a tic tac, smell like quarterback
Y-3 flip flops where'd you get that at
Dave the Barbarian Leopard skin mat
Pussy stay chasing me like Tom the cat
VR All-stars
Pass it pass it back
X-tentacion playing wit them racks
Lil Ll√†ri want a rari
Matt fucking sclat (skrrt skrrt skrrt)

Young Voorhees Sippin' porridge
Out of Versace bowls like a lord bitch
When I'm in the pussy I got Courage
That's why she ask for my hand in marriage
