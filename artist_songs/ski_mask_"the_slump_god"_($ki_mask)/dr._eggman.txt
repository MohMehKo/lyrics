[$ki Mask:]
Three bars on me I ain't talkin' bout the wi-fi
Ben 10 wrist; I ain't talkin' bout the sci-fi
Look at my leather same color as my caca
Feelin' like Messi trynna kick it like soccer
Ask me for cash I say pineapples (who?)
Caucasian gold I might shine at you
Math tutor I point the 9 at you
Fuck on you bitch while she sigh at you
I got my diamonds from Kony
But I still fuck with Obama
My jury so underwater, Osama (look at it, look at it)
I keep it 300 like then it's Sparta (look at it, look at it)
I'm lord like the Vader cuz I'm the father; (ya ya)
I told her giddy up like a rodeo llama (look at it, look at it, look at it)
Bitch, I'm ballin' like Melanie
What the fuck is you tellin' me
Like it's Resident Evil
I'm on the spider ok
Like catchin' me slumpin'
Stupid unconscious
Your bitch so I pulled up on her like crikey
Pull down that burberry skirt said I like it
Diamonds that's on me 1000 like Fauni
Drippin' like ICEE and Orange like Hi-C
I feel like I'm Miley
Oh I think they like me
Look at the gold as same color as my white tee
Got Christmas spirit my dick at your wifey

Gucci color goggles on my head up like the Eggman stretchin' my time like the sandman
Gucci color goggles on my head up like the Eggman stretchin' my time like the sandman
Feelin' like I'm Bob the builder yes I can man niggas run it up for hunned bands man
Feelin' like I'm Bob the builder yes I can man niggas run it up for hunned bands man
I can run it up to hunned band man [x3]
Run it up! [x3]

[Keith Ape:]
Eh, donja, ey, run it up, run it up, run it up, 혼자, ey run it up
Ey donja, ey

Not even a warrior could play with us
Fuck yeah all I need is H20
All in the Fiji water I mix it up
그 밑에 묻어버려
넌 결국에 두져버려
넌 거기서 끊어버려
Cash no ghouls no shooters but I got undertakers
Woulda take you underwater boy
넌 그냥 거기서 머물러
머물러 머물러 거기서 머 물러
넌 거기서 왜 자꾸 서둘러
서둘러봤자 너흐은 허우적
Skim ass dumass rappers see where
We trynna give them cabin fever
Makin' more money than Justin Bieber
But you know I'm also realer
[?] walkin' with me I didn't do much
I just run it up I'm the only bad man
[?]
