Bump a nigga fist
Meet me on the battleground, off a half a pound of destructo disk
Fresh as a brisk
Callin' out mo' curse words in the pussy than a show on adult swim
Rest in piss
Jewelry so water, (like a daughter[?]), jewelry lookin' like a shitty toilet
Sip that crisp
Paul Wall diamonds got a mothafucka sunny like I'm out in "Norbit"
I feel like I am Yo Gotti, all bad shawtys to the party
Heavy metal lookin' gnarly, got her fucking with the molly
Bitch on the flick like icarly, had that bitch body the body
Made that shit move no hands like a ouija
Water, water, water like a fiji

Talk yo shit, nigga
Talk yo shit, nigga
Talk yo shit, bet I hit you where yo lip, okay

Talk yo shit, nigga
Talk yo shit, nigga
Talk yo shit, bet I pull up on yo bitch, ay

Fender bender tell that pussy, "pull up"
Fender bender tell that pussy, "pull up"
Pull up on a nigga, tryna rob him for his figures
Nigga shitted, man a nigga need some pull ups
