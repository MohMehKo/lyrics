Gone, gone...

Nigga impatient, gone, gone
Nigga impatient, gone, gone
See anythin'?
Contemplatin', I don't want my soul to go to satan at all
Waitin', wait, wait, wait (oh were did it go?)
Sittin' and thinkin'
Contemplatin', I don't want my soul to go to satan at all
Impatient, wrist said impatient
Wrist said like fuck patience like
Pain, pain
Pain, pain
Pain
Do you feel my lane?
Feel me? lane, lane, lane
Gone...
