One! Nothings wrong with me
Two! Somethings wrong with me
Three 7's all up on my face
Ant Bully can't break my colony [x2]

I got blood on my boot
Stomp the yard, and his tooth
Canc√∫n
Water bezels Black and white like a raccoon
Full moon
Tryna feed XXX, another coon
Bitch I'm in the booth with the black
[?]
Flesh wound the pussy shark boy bite
Got em either way it go how I fight
So call em KK and I'm Ray J how you get fucked
Cause you know I brought the strap out like a dike might
With a [?] on his deathbed how he call to Christ
Line him up like on a sunny day bitch fly a kite
April first I'm not gon' fuck his bitch then say sike
Let her body hit the blow like I'm frost bite (okay)
Metal on me like a bender (mmm)
Sauce spilled on me like a blender (mmm)
You niggas sweet just like Splenda (mmm)
Box yo ass up like some Tinder (aye)
Dick on me that's what I lend her
After that whose to say that's the text that I sent her
Cheated on you like an answer
You captain underpants cause you defender (mmm)
Already said it
Know that she ready
Like I'm That's So Raven  and [?]
Fetty Wap fetti
Money, confetti
[?] tom not the brady
I'm never lazy
Eyesight be hazy
Still I run the set like Tom Brady
No one had made me
They gotta pay me
My jewelry sick like the patient (okay)

One! Nothings wrong with me
Two! Somethings wrong with me
Three 7's all up on my face
Ant Bully can't break my colony [x2]

Blow!
Let the bodies hit the floor!
