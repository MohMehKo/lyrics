[Hook:]
Mega supersonic blast them
On this bitch I had to do it to them
I ain't really wanna do it
Susie choosy on that cootchie
This that stack that paper
Suck me now and later like a now and later
Very fucking rare
I'm smoking Presidential
Call me Ronald Reagan

On that bitch had to go get them
Yes I had Molly with me
A bitch in the back of the Bentley
Here the double cup stack to the ceiling
Don-da-don-da call me cinderella[?]
[?] make a foreign ho
Had to turn the crib in to a trap
But this ain't the movie 'Home Alone'

[Hook]

The sky is falling
Bitch my crib is falling
Cause I'm in the kitchen whipping chicken littles
Either that or drinking blood from cattle
I'm a soul eater, eating bone marrow
Bet I catch the bitch and flip her like a switch
I bet I bone a bitch just like a fossil
Holy hollows and the start of [?]
Bet I point it at her make a bitch repent
I don't even want her, I don't [?]
Let my dawg spit game like Johnny Test
If a nigga try me I shall grab the blade
And cut his ass until there's nothing left
If you think then don't, then keep your pimpin strong
And don't be scared to fucking break a wrist
Stupid nigga I'ma take a risk
Trip [?]
