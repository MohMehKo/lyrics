Why don't you save it?
Know I can't take this
You missed this
You take it, you break it
I fucking hate it

I miss your energy and faith, I need
It's my talent to suffer, resting easily
So you use me, to hide from your pain
My sweet Valerie, can you feel my rain?

Why don't you save it?
We All Need Saving
Cause it's the truth
You take it, and break it
I fucking hate it

I miss your energy and faith, I need
It's my talent to suffer, resting easily
So you use me, to hide from your pain
My sweet Valerie, can you feel my rain?

I know
Take this bullshit no more
No more
No more
