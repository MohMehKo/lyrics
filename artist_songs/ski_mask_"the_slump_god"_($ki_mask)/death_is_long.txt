Bitch
Aye

Wait, mmh, rethink upon the mistakes, mmh
Death is long but worth the wait, mmh
Treat you like wishbone and break, mmh
Faith, mmh

Death is long but worth the wait, mmh
Treat you like wishbone and break, mmh

I think that death is a present, bitch
It is the answer to everything
Waiting for Grim Reaper's banishment
Or for my prayers
Be heard or be answered quick, mmh
Balmains I'm dressed in them layers bitch
Hopefully cover the pain that's in mmh
Middle finger to my sins, I fuck up again
Then fuck up the check, I win

Wait, mmh, rethink upon the mistakes, mmh
Death is long but worth the wait, mmh
Treat you like wishbone and break, mmh
Faith, mmh

Wait, mmh, rethink upon the mistakes, mmh
Death is long but worth the wait, mmh
Treat you like wishbone and break, mmh
Faith, aye

Bitch on my dick like sideways
Said it make her happy
Otherwise, that's Chipotle, mmh
Pinky in the Brain
Running will come try yours
Now she want my wiener, Oscar Mayer, mmh
Know that I'm Apollo
Know that you can't test me
Stunts on a jet ski
Bet me, mmh
Only looking for the joy that life hides me
Otherwise thinking in my head like damn me

Wait, mmh, rethink upon the mistakes, mmh
Death is long but worth the wait, mmh
Treat you like wishbone and break, mmh
Faith, mmh

Wait, mmh, rethink upon the mistakes, mmh
Death is long but worth the wait, mmh
Treat you like wishbone and break, mmh
Faith, aye
