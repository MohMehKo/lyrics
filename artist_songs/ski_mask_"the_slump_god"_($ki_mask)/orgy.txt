Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous
I'm so gorgeous lookin' like an orgy
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous
I'm so gorgeous ridin' round in Porches

Malcom in the Middle of her titties while they jiggle
Lookin' like a riddle, play that pussy like a fiddle
And my niggas got a little white like Stuart Little
She just like to sniff it, pop that pussy like a Skittle
Ridin' round [?] with a cherry bomb, ayy
Smokin' on loud like a car alarm ayy
Communication pussy like that one in [?], ayy
Peppermint my primo like a Taliban, ayy

Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous
I'm so gorgeous lookin' like an orgy
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous
I'm so gorgeous ridin' round in Porsches

Aye, a nigga got [?] (what?)
Had to switch it up like the border
Coach in that position call me Carter
Lookin' better than any fuck-nigga doin' it
My bitch's ass soft like a crumpet
Gold on me lookin' like a trumpet
Very Rare them niggas you don't fuck with
Pull up in the (pop pop pop) bitch
