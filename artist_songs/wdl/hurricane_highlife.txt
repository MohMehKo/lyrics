I don't care
Fame in a cell
Modern man replace me a bed
Maggie May everything's gonna be away
I can't relax myself 
But it keeps me alive
Soon I'll be gettin' my high
Good life
Won't blaze it down by the road
Rollin' & goalin' a mic that is old
I won't struggle, for pleasure
Sworn in the water, well I need the sea
You the science, me, 
I get the feeling that I won't retreat 
Won't, won't, sail, back home, 
Watch television, it's not what I do
You can not be the one that I knew

Hurricane highlife, somebody get this, make me decide
Hurricane highlife, I'm coming home
Hurricane highlife, somebody get this, make me decide
Hurricane highlife, I'm coming home

I don't care
Fame in a cell
Modern man replace me a bed
Maggie May everything's gonna be away
I can't relax myself 
But It keeps me alive
Soon I'll be gettin' my high
Good life
Won't blaze it down by the road
Rollin' & goalin' a mic that is old
I won't struggle, for pleasure
Sworn in the water, well I need the sea
You the science, me, 
I get the feeling that I won't retreat 
Won't, won't, sail, back home, 
Watch television, it's not what I do
You can not be the one that I knew

Hurricane highlife, somebody get this, make me decide
