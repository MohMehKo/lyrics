Now when I reached you
We kept on walking
One plus one make three
(You have to stay you, I have to stay me)

Now young love
This is the old kind
We makin'
(Big bang baby, Big bang baby, Big bang baby) 

Together we knew
Growing up to fast 
We braking trough
Like an oak tree we gon' last 
Berried in you
Born a lovers cast
Don't get confused
If you do I hope you ask

We made of stardust [x3]
Straight outta stone [x3]
We made of stardust [x3]
Straight outta stone [x3]

You know we changed the
Universe when we 
Blushed the sun bleedy
(If we can stay true then us could be free)

A heart beat 
Got lost when raving
Come around
(Big Bang Baby) 

Together we knew
Growing up to fast 
We braking trough
Like an oak tree we gon' last 
Berried in you
Born a lovers cast
Don't get confused
If you do I hope you ask

We made of stardust [x3]
Straight outta stone [x3]
We made of stardust [x3]
Straight outta stone [x3]

It all led up to this 
Moments of a bliss 
Every bite scar n vommit
Turn a teardrop to piss
Wakin' in a wish 
Dreamin' of mi life living 
So fucking real the devils sun looks forgiven
Forgotten forever 
I'm naked under this 
Naked under clothes 
Take em off for me fish 
Kadish dish 
We die rich
Starjunkie's makin love a business 
(Starjunkie's makin love a business)

We made of stardust [x3]
Straight outta stone [x3]
We made of stardust [x3]
Straight outta stone [x3]
