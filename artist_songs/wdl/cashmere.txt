Bloody hands on the wheel I drive
Headfirst into the night
Calm and steady like a surgeons knife
Steel toed bottoming out
No telling what the years will bring
I like that
Cause I’ll still be alike
Lucky through the better and the bad times
But now my luck has run out

Thickening my bones
Never right I’m not even close
Thickening my bones
Never right but I need it though
I leave nothing to warn her
Ripples in the water
Turning into storms how I wish you knew
That you'll never get close
My heart is a ghost to you

Riding round how my broke heart roams
Headless into the night
Throwing stones into perfect glass homes
This road never runs out
On nobody's side just asking me why
Cause I can't get enough
So alone I drive with no ending in sight
Cause I can't get enough

Thickening my bones
Never right I’m not even close
Thickening my bones
Never right but I need it though
I leave nothing to warn her
Ripples in the water
Turning into storms how I wish you knew
That you'll never get close
My heart is a ghost to you

I'll still be alike
