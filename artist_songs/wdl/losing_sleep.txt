I've been losing sleep tonight
Imma tell it like it is
I've been losing sleep tonight
And I need love
I've been losing sleep tonight
Imma tell it like it is
I've been losing sleep tonight
Got you on my mind

I've been losing sleep tonight
Imma tell it like it is
I've been losing sleep tonight
Got you on my mind
I've been losing sleep tonight
Imma tell it like it is
I've been losing sleep tonight
I got you on my mind

Every night I dream of you
Everything I see is you
Every night I dream of you
Everything I see is you
Every night I dream of you
Everything I see is you
Every night I dream of you
Everything I see is you
Every night I dream of you
Everything I see is you
Every night I dream of you
Everything I see is you
Every night I dream of you (I got you on my mind)
Everything I see is you
Every night I dream of you
Everything I see is you
Every night I dream of you
Everything I see is you
Every night I dream of you
Everything I see is you
Every night I dream of you
Everything I see is you
Every night I dream of you
Everything I see is you
Every night I dream of you
Everything I see is you
Every night I dream of you
Everything I see is you
Every night I dream of you
Everything I see is you
