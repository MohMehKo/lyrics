If you lost your mind this is what it'd sound like
Hands off the grips on a tin can motorbike
9000 RPMs
I'm riding like a pink dolphin swims

Kind of feels like a rerun
And it shouldn't even be fun
But I'm loving all the freedom
I guess I'm just a heathen
With a whole lotta' rhyme and a lot less reason
Tell me was the juice worth squeezing?
I'm a whole lot to live up to
Everyday totem like a kangaroo

It's just me in the world of sin
They think it's otherwise let em make pretend
Let the blood run, let they pain come
Let life take me back where I escaped from
I'll be the same asshole with a crown
Hoisted on my shadow head, never been a common noun
[?] cut me down
I'm Osiris, you're the reason for the sirens

I'm more ruthless, more that I age
I'm born to lash out cause my heart's caged
Yeah, I'm an animal wearing animals
Ya'll are biting like some chimped down mandibles
I can sense it on the meters
I'm about to go dumber than amoebas
Watch a whole mob sprint like cheetahs
I'm sizzling, stick me in the freezers
