Caught in the sinking sand
The wind flows fast through my fingers
Just reach out your hand and give me one thing to hold on to
Just give me one thing that isn't see through

Do you feel like the dream has passed?
Like time is a virus and it's found us at last
Just give me one thing to hold on to
Just give me one thing that isn't see through

We crashed into the ocean
(Don't disappear, don't vanish)
And you vanished in the night
(Don't disappear, don't vanish)

And now I'm crawling from the wreckage
(Don't disappear, don't vanish)
And I'm drowning in colors, I'm drowning in black and white
(Don't disappear, don't vanish)

You float like you're almost there
While the feathers rise like a snow storm in my head
Just give me one thing to hold on to
Just give me one thing that isn't see through

We crashed into the ocean
(Don't disappear, don't vanish)
And you vanished in the night
(Don't disappear, don't vanish)

And now I'm crawling from the wreckage
(Don't disappear, don't vanish)
And I'm drowning in colors, I'm drowning in black and white
(Don't disappear, don't vanish)

We crashed into the ocean
(Don't disappear, don't vanish)
And you vanished in the night
(Don't disappear, don't vanish)

And now I'm crawling from the wreckage
(Don't disappear, don't vanish)
I'm drowning in colors, I'm drowning in black and white
(Don't disappear, don't vanish)
