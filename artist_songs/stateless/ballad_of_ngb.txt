I can feel her rapid waves
Dark and glittering sharp and shimmering
So pure, so damn pure

Dancing in the kitchen cooking up a snowstorm
Dancing in the kitchen cooking up a snowstorm

She was woven with cloud and glass
Eyes like crystals and frozen fire
She stole in dressed only in a bracelet
Scarlet lipstick as sweet as a raisin
So pure, so damn pure

Dancing in the kitchen cooking up a snowstorm
Lie to me Matilda, Li-li-ie to me
Lie to me Matilda, Li-li-lie to me
Cuz I’m no damn good.
Lie to me Matilda, Li-li-lie to me
Lie to me Matilda, Li-li-li to me
Cuz I’m no damn good

Dancing in the Kitchen cooking up a snowstorm
I can feel the clock, tick-tock, tick-tock
In her room, ohh in her room
I can feel the clock, tick-tock, tick-tock
In her room, ohhh in her room

Dancing in the kitchen cooking up a snowstorm
Dancing in the kitchen cooking up a snowstorm
Dancing in the Kitchen cooking up a snowstorm
Dancing in the kitchen cooking up a snowstorm
