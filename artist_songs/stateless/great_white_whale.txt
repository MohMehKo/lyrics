When I was young, like seven or eight 
My dad would take us down to the pond 
Where we burned our necks and buried our legs 
Snacking on Kraft cheese and decrusted white bread 
When disciplined for wading too deep 
I'd section off a piece of the pond 
And corral the minnows sweeping my feet 
Into the kingdom, I built for their safety 

But they always escaped from my pond 
I made a lousy king 
I couldn't save them from the big sink 

When the pond was too big for us kids 
My father became the great white whale, and Megan and I would go fast to his fins 
And bask in the splash from his tireless tail 

A long way out much to our surprise we saw some women off in the distance 
My father told us to cover our eyes 
Until we passed the beach where the girls lie 
But I always had to peek 
I made a lousy son 
My white whale filled with grief 
And the pond was 

When the pond was too big for us kids 
My father became the great white whale, and Megan and I would go fast to his fins 
And bask in the splash from his tireless tail 

When our father drowned we looked and looked 
We cried and cried 
We shook and shook 
But he never was and we found our fear kicking towards the nudist beach 

When the pond was too big for us kids 
My father became the great white whale, and Megan and I would go fast to his fins 
And bask in the splash from his tireless tail 

When the pond was too big for us kids, 
My father became the great white whale, and Megan and I would go fast to his fins 
And bask in the splash from his tireless tail
