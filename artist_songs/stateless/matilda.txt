I recall when I first saw you, 
Walk on bridge and burning on hand, 
You startled as you approached me, 
Then you threw little coins into my cup, 

Why do you my hand? 
Surely that must mean you care for me [2x]

You said you read my fortune, 
Then you show me a few of your dance moves, 
In the pouring rain, 
You told me of your nightmare, 

Became a skeleton, 
Shot the president, 
Right between your eye

Why do hold my hand? 
Surely that must mean you care for me! [4x]
