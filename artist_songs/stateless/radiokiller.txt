You only went along for the ride
Seemed like a good idea at the time
And now you're out of your depth and there's no way back
Out of nowhere came the gun now you've become the walking dead

Spin trigger, she's a radio killer
She's a radio killer, turn the radio up killer
Spin trigger, she's a radio killer
She's a radio killer, turn the radio up killer

In the back of the car locked in handcuffs
Looking out of the window through the falling snow
Down town in the same second the red mist gathers
There's two dead, one in the head, someone will pay for this

Spin trigger, she's a radio killer
She's a radio killer, turn the radio up killer
Spin trigger, she's a radio killer
She's a radio killer, turn the radio up killer

Someone will pay for this
Someone will pay for this
Someone will pay for this
So just surrender

Spin trigger, she's a radio killer
She's a radio killer, turn the radio up killer
Spin trigger, she's a radio killer
She's a radio killer, turn the radio up killer
