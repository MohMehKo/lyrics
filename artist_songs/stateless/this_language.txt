Speak explosive speech, speech to keep us safe
A smiling fire bomb
Shake, shake another hand, crush another soul
With your fame and your medicine

I don't understand this language
You fight fire with fire and we all get burned
I don't understand this language
You fight fire with fire and we all get burned

Cast, cast another stone
A stone to keep us safe from these broken promises
Dream an everlasting dream
A dream where we escape these new speak savages

I don't understand this language
You fight fire with fire and we all get burned
I don't understand this language
You fight fire with fire and we all get burned

You better make for the oxygen tent
And try to sleep with one eye open
'Cause they have ways to divert your attention
They have ways to disguise the intention

Duck tape not just on my mouth I'm wrapped up in it
Can't break free from the money that's trapped up in it
Unwilling passenger on this suicide mission
Genocide every side getting dirtier and dirtier with every very new rendition

Every mother, every child that's died for the pride
Of the false stride of a politician
And they haunt every corner of my minds eye ask why?
But the answers are missing

With holes in the stories that are half truth half lie
Consequences smouldering
But the fire burns bright for the masses what's right
Is the life of the mission"

You better make for the oxygen tent
And try to sleep with one eye open
'Cause they have ways to divert your attention
They have ways to disguise the intention

Fire with fire and we'll all get burned
Fire with fire and we'll all get burned
Fire with fire and we'll all get burned
Fire with fire and we'll all get burned

I don't understand this language
(Fire with fire and we'll all get burned)
I don't understand this language
(Fire with fire and we'll all get burned)
I don't understand this language
(Fire with fire and we'll all get burned)
I don't understand
(Fire with fire and we'll all get burned)
