Feel rage, feel rage in enormity
As these days, it's taken constantly
My peeps say we're living the lives of the modern slave
Them kill joy away

Blow back, deep breath to take it in
Your slow dance, demons that live within
There's no chance in seeing the light in the day

Because I can't stand my visions of sleep
My mind just takes hold, visions and transforms
Memories of waking dreams tell
All that we are, we are our maker's sins

Time for time, it's been growing in fields of blood
Now we done flowered, black as night
Because of all those who've been watering us lies
Subconscious thoughts
Beginnings of life is all so bad, all so wrong
