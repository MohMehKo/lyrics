Everything started spinning and I woke up by the side of the road
How did I get down here?
How did I get down here?
High up above me I could discern a light through the trees
I always knew you'd come for me

A stumbled stance, so intimate yet so departed
And it reminded me
of something beautiful
And it reminded me
of something beautiful

She began her dance for the sky design
It took me back beyond your space, beyond our time
It was no illusion I could hear your voice
I always knew you'd come for me

A stumbled stance, so intimate yet so departed
And it reminded me of something beautiful
And it reminded me of something beautiful
And it reminded me of something beautiful
And it reminded me of something beautiful

And it reminded me of something beautiful
Yes, it reminded me of something beautiful
And it reminded me of something beautiful
And it reminded me of something beautiful
