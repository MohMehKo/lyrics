Can you lie still without making a sound?
Pacified hell, just don't scratch the surface

Away, away, you're running out, you're running out
You're running out, you're running out

How long before you crack?
How long before you turn back?

She knows you too well, she'll watch your every move
Better to not know than to endure this silence

Always, always

How long before you crack?
How long before you turn back?

Your ground will fall from under your feet
Your sky will crumble in, you will be swallowed alive

You're running out, you're running out

How long before you crack?
How long before you turn back?
How long before you crack?
How long before you turn back?

You turn back
You turn back
You turn back
