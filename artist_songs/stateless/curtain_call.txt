Won't you come sit here by the fire with me?
Tell me your stories, all the places you've been
With a diamond in your mouth
You showed me the way through the temple
We drank wine from the Emperor's glass
And danced until sunrise
You must confess you're not exactly innocent in all this
We both knew what time it was as soon as you walked in

So now I'm gonna vanish with you
So now I'm gonna vanish with you
Maria and the sailors they'll tango til dawn
But I'm leaving with you girl
What else can i do?
The sound of the helicopter the hammer on the floor
The old neon liquor sign just above the door
Sister put the gun down and come
Kiss the sky cause if you
Wanna be a killer then you're not friend of mine

At quarter past midnight we walk out to the ocean
I watch you bathing in the moonlight
We take the jewel from the tomb and fly to our cave
And watch as the oldest mountains burst into flame
You must confess you're not exactly innocent in all this
We both knew what time it was as soon as you walked in

So now I'm gonna vanish with you
So now I'm gonna vanish with you
Maria and the sailors they'll tango til dawn
But I'm leaving with you girl
What else can i do?
The sound of the helicopter the hammer on the floor
The old neon liquor sign just above the door
Sister put the gun down and come
Kiss the sky cause if you
Wanna be a killer then you're not friend of mine
