He was faceless here on the earth
He was shaped without a form,
He was shade without color
And the children can move him,
The elders can move him,

Once mother nature has shaken your very foundations
She brings you back to find the healing inside
The healing inside

He was chained inside hollow cave
and the women who move him,
The men who could move him,
He said, "Goddess brings the brightest stars.
"Goddess brings the brightest stars, yeah."

Once mother nature has shaken your very foundations
You will find the answers you've got to meet in time,
And those old, old demons you find make way and you'll fall
