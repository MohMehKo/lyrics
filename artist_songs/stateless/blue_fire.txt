The snow is full of ghost tonight
The fire's teeth so light
And we've been waiting for you
We've been waiting for you

The snow is full of ghost tonight
The fire's teeth so light
And we've been waiting for you
We've been waiting for you

I woke up with the snow flakes, falling on my face
With the door wide opened and the colored wind
Crying inside, the song you sang to me
Floated across the lake as you danced so gracefully
In the colored moonlight 

Waited so long, to dive in
Make waves in the blue blue fire
Waited so long, to climb in
Take shape in the blue blue fire 

The snow is full of ghost tonight
The fire's teeth so light
And we've been waiting for you
We've been waiting for you

I chased you to the binding lake
All in a while I was fast asleep
We sat and smiled and gazed the wild
With each flame to our faces

The question and every movement
And then listened for a reply
We had our dance so anxiously
And listened for a reply

Waited so long, to dive in
Make waves in the blue blue fire
Waited so long, to climb in
Take shape in the blue blue fire

We've been waiting for you
We've been waiting for you
We've been waiting for you 
We've been waiting for you

The snow is full of ghost tonight
The forest is alive
We've been waiting for you
We've been waiting for you [x2]

Waited so long, to dive in
Make waves in the blue blue fire
Waited so long, to climb in
Take shape in the blue blue fire
