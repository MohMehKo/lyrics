Whatever you've done, just bury it
And swim back down to the ocean bed
And find the secret place where we buried those bones
While we explode our shipwrecks with pockets full of stones

I don't care where we've been tonight, 
It is of no consequence my dear, 
Just stay here, my arms are wide, my love
And the rest of the world could disappear and I wouldn't care

Cause I'm on fire

I guess I should open another bottle of wine
Light another cigarette and turn the record over
And play the songs we sang when we buried those bones
While we explored our shipwrecks with pockets full of stones
