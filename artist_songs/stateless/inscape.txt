We wake with our forms all tangled up
Frozen in silence, no sound save breathing
I can feel your skin on my skin
How did it get so cold in here?

I need to crawl inside your shivers
We let go of ourselves sometimes
And I'm crawling inside your shivers
We let go of ourselves sometimes
And I'm crawling inside

And we rise in the air from our cradle shell
Like tears we fall on to the ice
We lay entangled, ice against skin
How did it get so cold out here?

I need to crawl inside your shivers
We let go of ourselves sometimes
I'm crawling inside your shivers
We let go of ourselves sometimes

And I'm crawling inside your shivers
Oh, we let go of ourselves sometimes
And I'm crawling inside your shivers
We let go of ourselves sometimes
And I'm crawling inside your shivers
