A selfish act of decency
I supplied you on the phone
Faded past, lost memories
You think it best if I go

I kept you around for when I fall down
I'll need you there for me
Unto you, I'll give my heart
But then you take it all away from me

Leave it alone, while I'm pushing away
I don't feel you close to me
Taking away what's left in me
Now I need to find a way

I don't want to lose you, not before I change
I don't need to use you, nothing more I'd gain

I think
I'm scared
Of being here
Take it all away
