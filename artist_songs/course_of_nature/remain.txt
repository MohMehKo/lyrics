I feel it coming from a far off place
I need assistance with a change of pace
In my heart now there's an empty space
But you can change it
Bring your heart my way

I've been through this alone before
I know no other way
I wish that I could have the heart to stay
Losing what we started for
Destroyed everything
Remnants of a life with you remain

Don't be alarmed now I'm not grateful
For all you're given, it's so much bullshit
Run over wisdom, headed straight for deceit
It's rather sad now, what you've done to me

I don't belong here, take me far away
But if we change now
Bring your heart my way
