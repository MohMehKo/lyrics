I wasn't sure of when but I
Knew there'd come a time when I
Would feel this way about someone
And always need them by my side

You could make me want to leave the one I'm with
And never wonder why
If I was ever given something else
I'd give it back 1000 times
There is just something hard for me to grasp
How it was I could survive
If I would have to live my life without

I've felt so strong for you ever since
The day you caught my eyes and I
Can't help but wonder if my life
Is turning upside down this time
