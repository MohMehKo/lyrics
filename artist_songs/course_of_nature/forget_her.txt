Staring out the window
I am blinded by
Thoughts surrounding you
I am hypnotized

I'm gonna make believe
You're gonna come with me
Just give me half a chance
Maybe you will see

I'm better

The day I went away
It was a big mistake
Couldn't turn around
To see your face

Forget her

'Cause I'd walk a thousand miles
Down this road for you
And I'd climb the highest mountain
Touch the sky for you, for you

Forget her

I can feel you growing colder
As each day goes by
I'm just a memory
That you'll forget in time

I'm gonna make believe
You're gonna come with me
Just give me half a chance
And maybe you will see

I'm better

The day I went away
It was a big mistake
Couldn't turn around
To see your face

'Cause I'd walk a thousand miles
Down this road for you
And I'd climb the highest mountain
Touch the sky for you

I will make you believe
You can count on me
I'm the one for you

I will fight to keep you by my side
I would die for you, for you

Can we make a promise
We'll always keep
I'll be there for you
Will you be there for me?

If we make this promise
You can count on me
As time goes by
You'll still be all I need

'Cause I'd walk a thousand miles
Down this road for you
And I'd climb the highest mountain
Touch the sky for you

I will make you believe
You can count on me
I'm the one for you

I will fight to keep you by my side
I would die for you, for you

Forget her
