Something says to me don't be afraid
But if I don't worry I'll surely slip away
I need to speak to you, hear what you say
But if I breathe too hard I think I'll go insane

There's a part of me so insecure
Of all that I could have and all that I've gone through
If there could be a way through a better design
I'd probably screw it up and let it slip away

Well I wonder if I stayed here would you become a better part of me
I can say now that you changed me and I've become a better part of me

I am the strongest I have ever been
The very thought of you can't even comprehend
The safest bet for me is to focus hard
And try to face myself I can't take it anymore

I hope I'm everything
That I need to be
You are my everything
So I'll just stay
