Something has happened to your world
Can you imagine you cold
There's too much pressure on you now
Why you wold ever throw away
What's been given to you
Woke up and nothing's even there

Now you're falling too far away
It is hard

Sit inside your wall of shame
Believing what's forgotten
You make it hard to find the world
Sit inside your wall of shame
And nothing even matters
What can you say but I'm to blame

When trouble lingers on your mind
You wait; but dig in deeper
There's no more room for honesty
Breathe in the vapor of your lies
Just when you're choking on them
These thoughts are spinning around your head
