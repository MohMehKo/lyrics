You're my distance, destination of choice
I'd give anything just to hear your voice
I could've passed you on the street
Without saying a word
Most times I miss the voice
That goes unheard

What if I missed you
You got caught in the sun
What if I did something
Never to be undone

People everywhere how could I be sure
If it's you that I have been looking for
What would it take for me to be comfortable
With you, with me you're the chosen one

What if I missed you
You got caught in the sun
What if I did something
Never to be undone

You are there for me this I hope and pray
You will wait for me, I won't be too late

What if I missed you
You got caught in the sun
What if I did something
Never to be undone

Will you wait for me
Or will I be too late this time
You are there for me this I hope and pray
