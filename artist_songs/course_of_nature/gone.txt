I'm sad when I'm gone, but I'm leaving again
What do you think? Could you even care?
I tried to be strong, but I wanna cry
So I hold you close as I say goodbye

And I'm sorry, I won't be with you tonight
When you close your eyes
And I feel so guilty
As I walk away from you again

You know that I want the best for you
And I hope that you're right
If I had it my way
I could be with you tonight

I'm coming home to you
I can finally see the light
And if I should make it through
I will be with you tonight

To have and to hold, protect and provide
All you should need, I won't deny
And I need to see that smile on your face
The look in your eyes, it takes me away

And I'm sorry, I won't be with you tonight
But you're on my mind
And I feel so helpless
All I want is just to be with you again

You know that I want the best for you
And I hope that you're right
If I had it my way
I could be with you tonight

I'm coming home to you
I can finally see the light
And if I should make it through
I will be with you tonight

I've been away for so long
And it's been so hard on my own
I think about you every single day
I can't wait to come back home

You know that I want the best for you
And I hope that you're right
If I had it my way
I could be with you tonight

I'm coming home to you
I can finally see the light
And if I should make it through
I will be with you tonight
I will be with you tonight
