Come closer now
Let me feel your heart beat
Just stay here forever

Sometimes I wonder
Is this real or am I
Only waiting to wake up?

Right before my eyes
I see your face
And it makes me smile

I want you to stare
I feel like I'm lost without you
And life just can't be the same

Took my breath away
I felt like I just lost you
Right before my eyes

For the first time
I can see forever
I don't feel alone now

There'll be times
When I let you down
But I will always be there

Right before my eyes
I see your face
And it makes me smile

I want you to stare
I feel like I'm lost without you
And life just can't be the same

Took my breath away
I felt like I just lost you
Right before my

All the times I've felt alone
'Cause I've been wrong
Until now my life has felt so long

Now every part of me is letting go
But I will never let you go
Won't let you go, I won't let you go

I want you to stare
I feel like I'm lost without you
And life just can't be the same

Took my breath away
I felt like I just lost you
Right before my eyes
Right before my eyes

Took my breath away
I felt like I just lost you
Right before my eyes

Come closer now
Let me feel your heart beat
Just stay here forever
