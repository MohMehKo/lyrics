I walk alone tonight
I feel so cold inside
As I call out your name
For the last time

Another picture frame
Broken and thrown away
But the memory of you
Never fades

When your timing isn't right
You can feel it every time
From the words you couldn't say
To the stupid games we play

Do we dare to cross that line
Just to do it one more time
Is it worth the pain to get lost again
If we know that it's not right

Hung up the phone with you
And from that moment I knew
Things would never be the same
As they used to

Remember when we used to lay
Together in our bed all day
All I want is what we had
Yesterday

When your timing isn't right
You can feel it every time
From the words you couldn't say
To the stupid games we play

Do we dare to cross that line
Just to do it one more time
Is it worth the pain to get lost again
When we know that it's not right

If I could change just one thing
I know what I'd do
All I took for granted
I'd make it up to you

These days I am living
With nothing left of you
Just broken hard and empty
And the memory of you

When your timing isn't right
You can feel it every time
From the words you couldn't say
To the stupid games we play

Do we dare to cross that line
Just to do it one more time
Is it worth the pain to get lost again
When we know that it's not right
