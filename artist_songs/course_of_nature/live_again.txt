I'm calling you out on what you've done
I want you to feel the way I do
I'm starting to hate what I've become
And it's all because of you

And the guilt you put on me
Was enough to drag me down
Took everything I had
To keep me hanging on

I've been down so long
I've seen the bottom from below
I watch you walk all over me
I'm over this

I beat my head up against the wall
I force my pieces back to whole
I form my way back from the dead
To live my life again

You let me down for way too long
And I can't stand the way it feels
I'll turn the tables on you now
And put my faith in something real

And the guilt you put on me
Was enough to drag me down
Took everything I had
To keep me hanging on

I've been down so long
I've seen the bottom from below
I watch you walk all over me
I'm over this

I beat my head up against the wall
I force my pieces back to whole
I form my way back from the dead
To live my life again, again

I'm calling you out on what you've done
I want you to feel the way I do
I'm starting to hate what I've become
And it's all because of you

I've been down so long
I've seen the bottom from below
I watch you walk all over me
I'm over this

I beat my head up against the wall
I force my pieces back to whole
I form my way back from the dead
To live again

To live again
To live again
To live again
To live again
