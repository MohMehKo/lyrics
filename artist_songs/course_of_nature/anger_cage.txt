Since the day that I was born
I've been a prisoner of the storm
But the time has come
Now I've had enough
I can't take it anymore

The blood rushes to my head
And you deserve everything you get
The love is gone
And there's nothing left here
But the love you try to hate

Tell me now who's to blame?
Will I burst from the rage?
Hear it callin' my name
Down in your anger cage
You are the cause of the fightin'
You force my rage out of hiding

Well do you stop and look at me
As if I'm the enemy
You know that you've crossed the line for the last time
When you trampled over me

The blood rushes to my head
And you deserve everything you get
The love is gone
And there's nothing left here
But the love you try to hate

Tell me now who's to blame?
Will I burst from the rage?
Hear it callin' my name
Down in your anger cage
You are the cause of the fightin'
You force my rage out of hidin'

I started losing it
I, I'm out of control
This rage is killin' me
Yeah, it's takin' it's toll
I'm fallin' apart from here
I can see the end
It's all so clear
I might choke, suffocate
Inside my anger cage

Tell me now who's to blame?
Will I burst from the rage?
Hear it callin' my name
Down in your anger cage
You are the cause of the fightin'
You force my rage out of hidin'

Don't care what you say
I don't give a damn
You talk about me
But you don't know who I am
Don't care what you say
I don't give a damn
You talk about me
But you don't know who I am
You talk about me
But you don't know who I am
You talk about me but you don't know
