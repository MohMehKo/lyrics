I see my life is taking time away from me
Chains that bind the things I want to change, 
I can't break free
I told you so, now I can't let go
Of the things I've strived so hard to be

I'm afraid I've come too far
My changing life's been torn apart
But I won't give up on my dreams
I don't think I'll ever see
The things you wanted me to see
I only hope we can be friends - again

Pain, the pain I"ve felt is growing deep inside of me
I can't imagine what you wanted me to be
What if I fell down; would you pick me up
Would you be there taking stabs at me
