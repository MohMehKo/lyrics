Am I noble
Or am I a fake
Oh, so fragile
But hard to break

With my back against the wall
Still I am falling
I can't find my way
I can't find my calling

Back in the day
Time is dissolving
The world standing still
While I am revolving

I'm all alone
Holding out my hand for you
To keep me from falling

I'm crawling out the window
The ground's so far away
I feel the ledge beneath me
As it crumbles, it falls away

All my dreams
That have not come true
Aspirations
That I had for you

With my back against the wall
I hear you calling
I can't find my wings
To keep me from falling

So I reach for your hand
But fingers are slipping
Is this the end
And just the beginning?

I'm all alone
Holding out my hand for you
To keep me from falling

Crawling out the window
The ground's so far away
I feel the ledge beneath me
As it crumbles, it falls away

Crawling out the window
The ground's so far away
I'm falling into nothing
And no one can hear me scream
Hear me scream

Let go of the lies you've held on to
Let go of the misery pain put you through
Let go of insecurities plaguing you
Let go, let go, I know you want to

Crawling out the window
The ground's so far away
I feel the ledge beneath me
As it crumbles, it falls away

Crawling out the window
It falls away
Crawling out the window
It falls away
