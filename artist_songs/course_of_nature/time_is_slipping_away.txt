With a face of stone my wounds are showing
In my room alone my fear are growing
Have I lost my place? Did I fall behind?
Did I fall from grace? Did you change your mind?

Thanks to you, I've had enough
It makes no sense to fall in love
What I should do, I should give it up
Stop wasting time 'cause time is slipping away

Thanks to you, I've had enough
It makes no sense to fall in love
What I should do, I should give it up
Stop wasting time 'cause time is slipping away
'Cause time is slipping away

Couldn't seem to change to suit you better
What a waste of time we were together
When I lost my place, I was left behind
Didn't fall from grace 'cause I changed my mind

Thanks to you, I've had enough
It makes no sense to fall in love
What I should do, I should give it up
Stop wasting time 'cause time is slipping away

Thanks to you, I've had enough
It makes no sense to fall in love
What I should do, I should give it up
Stop wasting time 'cause time is slipping away

'Cause time is slipping away
'Cause time is slipping away

Couldn't seem to change to suit you better
What a waste of time we were together

Thanks to you, I've had enough
It makes no sense to fall in love
What I should do, I should give it up
Stop wasting time 'cause time is slipping away

Thanks to you, I've had enough
It makes no sense to fall in love
What I should do, I should give it up
Stop wasting time 'cause time is slipping away

'Cause time is slipping away
'Cause time is slipping away
'Cause time is slipping away
'Cause time is slipping away
'Cause time is slipping away
