Where the rivers run deep, the masses they flow
To claim what is theirs and what they are owed
But the quicker it comes, the harder it goes
And people they change to fit the mold

You might end up without anything

You haven't learned a thing, you need a dose of humility
No one cares how great you are
(How great you are, how great you are)
And you'd be lying to yourself to think
You're holding up well when what you have is who you are

Your time's running out the hourglass filling
Your appearance is tough but inside your reeling
When is it enough to fill all your needs
To satisfy your ego and meet your greed

You might end up without anything

You haven't learned a thing, you need a dose of humility
No one cares how great you are
(How great you are, how great you are)
And you'd be lying to yourself to think
You're holding up well when what you have is who you are

Your scared your going down
No one to build you up
And who will catch you when you fall
And who will catch you when you fall

You haven't learned a thing, you need a dose of humility
No one cares how great you are
(How great you are, how great you are)
And you'd be lying to yourself to think
You're holding up well when what you have is who you are

You haven't learned a thing, you need a dose of humility
No one cares how great you are
(How great you are, how great you are)
And you'd be lying to yourself to think
You're holding up well when what you have is who you are
