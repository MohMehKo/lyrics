I am not afraid of you
Look at me you'll see it's true
You are broken falling down
And now you're nothing, nothing

This time I want it too much
I just needed time to dust myself off
I can see much further than you
Enough to keep on trying
After the fall

I've wated time and energy
On your foolish pride you see
You will find in time from me
That you are nothing, nothing
