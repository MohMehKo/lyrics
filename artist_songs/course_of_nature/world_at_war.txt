When the world?s at war, who will you be for?
When it comes to life, are you the enemy?
Have we lost our minds or are we just blind
To the world outside? This is reality

Burn it up, the world's on fire
And all that's left are cheaters and liars
What once was whole, is now divided
The strong are weak and the world's out of control

A new life is born without anyone
Who will give to him sense of morality?
Could be good, could be bad but no one gives a damn
So he turns the world into his enemy

Burn it up, the world's on fire
And all that's left are cheaters and liars
What once was whole, is now divided
The strong are weak and the world has burn out of control

Have we lost our souls
There?s no safe anymore
We?re a world at war
We?re a world at war

We?re running away but we just can?t escape
The burdens we build from all our mistakes
Will we find out in the end?
There?s no one left here to defend, to defend, to defend

And the world has burn out of control
Have we lost our souls?
There?s no safe anymore, we?re a world at war
We are a world at war and we?re out of control

Have we lost our souls?
There?s no safe anymore
We?re a world at war
We?re a world at war

Burn it up, the world's on fire
And all that's left are cheaters and liars
What once was whole, is now divided
The strong are weak and the world's out of control
