Baby I've tried for you
But this heart's not bullet proof
It's like you live with all your guns against me
You shoot love down you push my heart around
And I'm taking no more
Of your faking no more

Bang bang You shot my heart
Bang bang Blown it apart
Bang bang You blew my love away hey hey hey
Bang bang You fire on me
Your hurt and jealousy
Bang bang You've blown our love away hey hey hey

You shoot love down you push my heart around
But I'm taking no more
Of your faking no more

Bang bang...
Bang bang...
