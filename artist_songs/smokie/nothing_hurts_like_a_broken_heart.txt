I've been around for a day or two
I've had my share of the colour blue
I haven't learned what it's all about, no I
I've seen the eyes of a girl in love

but all I know is that

Nothing hurts like a broken heart
All we need is a brand new start, I'm telling you
You've got to let go
Nothing hurts like a broken heart
All we need is a brand new start, I'm telling you
You've got to let go

When you search for a pot of gold
Along the way you might lose your soul
It might be worth all the pain, I guess, but I
Well I suppose we try our hardest, but all I know is that

Nothing hurts like a broken heart
All we need is a brand new start, I'm telling you
You've got to let go
Nothing hurts like a broken heart
All we need is a brand new start, I'm telling you
You've got to let go

No one wants to stay lonely
All we do is learn it slowly
Just so you know you're not the only one, yeah

Nothing hurts like a broken heart
All we need is a brand new start, I'm telling you
You've got to let go
Nothing hurts like a broken heart
All we need is a brand new start, I'm telling you
You've just got to let go
Let go
You've just got to let go
