Live a life on the road
Got a long way to go
Just a musical man
With a traveling show

Ooh, I never have much time to spare
'Cos, still I'm only half way there
Don't you know, don't you know
It's a long way from home

There's a girl on my mind
Waiting back home
She's been standin' in line
For so very long

Ooh, I wish I had her close by my side
I wish she'd come along for the ride
Don't you know, don't you know
It's a long way from home

It's a long way, long way from home
It's a long way, long way from home
Such a long way, long way from home

No more hotel rooms
And hotel bars
No more of those trains, or no planes
Or no sass stained cards

Or no more time on the show
Soon I'll be with her I know
Don't you know, don't you know
It's a long way from home

It's a long way, long way from home
It's a long way, long way from home
Such a long way, long way from home

All right yeah, yeah
All right
Come on
