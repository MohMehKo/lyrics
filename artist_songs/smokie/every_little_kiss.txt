Understand what you mean to me
My growing hunger for your love
I haven't always shown the way I feel
A crime I know I'm guilty of

But try to understand
It's taken me so long
to free my mind
To open up to all this love
you have to give

With every little kiss
You release the love in me
With every little kiss
I give in so helplessly
No I never knew what love was about until you
Showed me how to feel
With every little kiss
Oh, every little kiss

I will be your fantasy
Every desire that you dream of
I'll be your shining knight
I'll be your Romeo, your guiding light
You hold the key to all the love that's locked inside

With every little kiss
You release the love in me
With every little kiss
I give in so helplessly
No I never knew what love was about until you
Showed me how to feel
With every little kiss

There are times we touch
I feel the beatin' of your heart
Touch me darlin' with your warm caress
Every breath we take
Brings us to a higher love
Say we'll be forever girl
With every little kiss

Understand what you mean to me
My growing hunger for your love
I will be your fantasy
Every desire that you dream of

With every little kiss
I'll be your shining knight
Trust in me your guiding light
Now you show me what love is
We can share every little kiss

I will be your fantasy...
