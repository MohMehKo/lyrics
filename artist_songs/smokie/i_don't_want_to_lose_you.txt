You're messing up the rules baby
Abd that's just ain't fair
I thought that we be cool darling
But you just don't care

I've been up and down around the world
Just to find a girl like you

I don't want to lose you baby
Standing there you drive me crazy
I don't want to lose you baby now

I don't want to hurt your feelings
Just want to make you smile
Give a second chance now baby
I'll go the extra mile

Round and round that's where we go
Where this stops nobody knows

I don't want to lose you baby
I don't want to hear a maybe
I don't want to lose you baby now

It's not your style
It's not the way you call my name
Ohh baby can't you see
I need you just the same

I've been up and down around the world
Never found no one like you

I don't want to lose you baby
Standing there you drive me crazy
I don't want to lose you baby now

It's not your style
It's not the way you call my name
No matter what
You know just how to play this game

I don't want to lose you darling
So just don't go
I don't want to lose you baby
So don't say no

I've been up and down around the world
Just to find a girl like you

I don't want to lose you baby
I don't want to hear a maybe
I don't want to lose you baby now
