I was five years old
When I first saw her face
I can see her now, school yard was the place
And she took my breath away
'Cause I felt love that day

I was ten years old
When mama said goodbye
I was just a boy when I saw my daddy cry
And it took my breath away
'Cause I felt love that day

I'm getting feelings that I can't control
Are you feeling the same
Open my heart, take a look at my soul
And love me again

I was seventeen
When I made love to her
We were lying there, naked, warm and pure
And she took my breath away
When we made love that day

I'm getting feelings that I can't control
Are you feeling the same
Open my heart, take a look at my soul
And love me again

I was twenty-one
When I held him in my arms
He was my first born
oh the dreams that I had planned
And he took my breath away
'Cause I held love that day

Oh girl, I feel love today
