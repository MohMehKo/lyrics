If I lied just another day
The strength I needed flew away
You have hurt my pride
Than walked away, I almost died
That day

You were always on my mind (You were always on my mind)
The thoughts you'd tell me were so unkind
My heart was in your hand
You dropped it outside in the sand
That day

Well the time that keeps on turning
And the wheels go round and round
But my thoughts still go on burning for you
And I think that I can make it
Doing things out of my own
If I'm wrong then I can fake it for you

You were always by my side
The river changed, another tide
You had another guy
I drowned then when you told a lie
I cried

I thought we'd found our promised land (Ahhh ah)
You cut the rope with just a hand
The love you tore apart
Could never ever touch your hearts
Command

Well the time that keeps on turning
And the wheels go round and round
But my thoughts still go on burning for you
And I think that I can make it
Doing things out of my own
If I'm wrong then I can fake it for you

Well the time that keeps on turning
And the wheels go round and round
But my thoughts still go on burning for you
And I think that I can make it
Doing things out of my own
If I'm wrong then I can fake it for you
