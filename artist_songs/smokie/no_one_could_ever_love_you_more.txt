No one could ever love you more
Just like I loved you once before
No one could ever love you, never, never, never
And I will know this all is true
No one can thrill me like you do
And I will be with you forever, ever, ever

And I can still recall the day
And I will always hear you say
That all you really want is love, love, love
And than I'd be what I would be
No longer walkin' to be free
And so I send to you my love, love, love

No one could ever love you more
Just like I loved you once before
No one could ever love you, never, never, never
And I will know this all is true
No one can thrill me like you do
And I will be with you forever, ever, ever

And our love's born
And you get me on
And there'll be no dawn in our love
It will always be just you and me
Oh, wait and see another love

No one could ever love you more
Just like I loved you once before
No one could ever love you, never, never, never
And I will know this all is true
No one can thrill me like you do
And I will be with you forever, ever, ever
