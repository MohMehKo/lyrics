Late at night out on the street I found myself going nowhere
Just walking and thinking, soaking up the midnight air
Following the footsteps of a total stranger
Just a wandering soul with no sense of danger

In the distance there is a shadow from a doorways I grow near
In the doorway stood a lady with a smile behind her silent tear
I asked her if she like me needed company
Then we took to the night, two hearts running free

A midnight delight
In the midnight hour
A midnight delight
It was hard to believe
A midnight delight
A total stranger
A midnight delight
Making love to me
A midnight delight
While in the street lights
A midnight delight
Out on the town
A midnight delight
Oh, that little lady
She don't fool around

I asked her if she like me needed company
Then we took to the night, two hearts running free

A midnight delight
In the midnight hour
A midnight delight
It was hard to believe
A midnight delight
A total stranger
A midnight delight
Makes sweet love to me
A midnight delight
Out in the street lights
A midnight delight
Out on the town
A midnight delight
Oh, that little lady
She don't fool around

Late at night out on the street I found myself going nowhere
Just walking and thinking, soaking up the midnight air
Following the footsteps of a total stranger
A wandering soul with no sense of danger

A midnight delight
In the midnight hour
A midnight delight
It was hard to believe
A midnight delight
A total stranger
A midnight delight
Making love to me
A midnight delight
A midnight delight
A midnight delight
A midnight delight
A midnight delight

A midnight delight
In the midnight hour
A midnight delight
So hard to believe
A midnight delight
A total stranger
A midnight delight
Makes sweet love to me...
