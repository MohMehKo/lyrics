[Verse 1:]
Let me take this moment, just to tell you that;
You can always count on me.
It's automatic, I think about you everyday;
And this is how I feel:

[Chorus:]
Every time I hold ya, I believe in what I told ya;
You're my everything, my shining star;
That's just what you are.
Like a flower needs the sunlight;
Like a ship that sails the ocean;
I will never live to see another day;
If I can't love you.

If I can't love you. 

[Verse 2:]
When I see you smiling, it just takes away;
All the troubles in my life.
But does it matter, if you're far away from me?
'Cause you're always on my mind.

[Chorus:]
Every time I hold ya, I believe in what I told ya;
You're my everything, my shining star;
That's just what you are.
Like a flower needs the sunlight;
Like a ship that sails the ocean;
I will never live to see another day;
If I can't love you.

[Bridge:]
I run to you like a river song;
Now I know just where I belong;
It's by your side.
You lift me up when I'm feeling down;
And take me up to a higher ground;
And you make me fly.

[Chorus:]
Every time I hold ya, I believe in what I told ya;
You're my everything, my shining star;
That's just what you are.
Like a flower needs the sunlight;
Like a ship that sails the ocean;
I will never live to see another day;
If I can't love you.

If I can't love you
