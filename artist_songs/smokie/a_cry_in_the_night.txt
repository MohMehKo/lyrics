I know you don't want me
I see it burning in your eyes
And after all this time baby
There can be no compromise

Oh, it won't come easy
It's much too hard to give away
You're lying to me baby
But you'll cry another day

You're telling me lies
You're telling me lies
Like I've never heard
Oh, baby

A cry in the night from one lonely heart
Drowned in passion alone from the start
A cry in the night that nobody hears
Cry in the night

I turn away
From the secrets that you keep
But I can't shake lose
I'm still crying in my sleep

You're telling me lies
You're telling me lies
Like I've never heard
Baby

A cry in the night from one lonely heart
Drowned in passion alone from the start
A cry in the night that nobody hears
Cry in the night

Oh, baby

A cry in the night from one lonely heart
Drowned in passion alone from the start
A cry in the night that nobody hears
Cry in the night
