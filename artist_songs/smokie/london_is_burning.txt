London is burning, see the flames in the night
And I don't want to know any more
London is burning, it's a terrible sight
And I don't want to know any more

See the churches and houses
Burned to the ground
London is burning
Spread it around

London is burning, streets full of fear
And I don't want to know any more
London is burning, may the plague disappear
And I don't want to know any more

God save this city
God save the crown
London is burning
Spread it around

Simon sits beyond despair
Lost in the flickering light
But he doesn't really care
The life has lost his fight
Lost in the flickering light

London is burning, see the flames in the night
And I don't want to know any more
London is burning, it's a terrible sight
And I don't want to know any more

All kinds of people
In all parts of town
Say London is burning
Spread it around
