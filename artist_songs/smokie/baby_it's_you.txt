I was lost and at an end
It seemed so long
I really needed a friend
Why should I pretend?

I couldn't think I had to see
That Southern Comfort comforts me
I could be free
But where would I be?

Then you came along
And you sang your song
And you made my day
In your special way

Then I knew
That baby it's you
Baby it's you
You know that it's you I'm thinking of
Baby it's you

Try my best to get along
Make some friends, but something always went wrong
I come on too strong
Things were really getting rough
Getting tired of acting like I was tough
I just had enough

Then you came along
And you sang your song
And you made my day
In your special way

Then I knew
That baby it's you
Baby it's you
You know that it's you I'm thinking of
Baby it's you

[Chorus x2]
