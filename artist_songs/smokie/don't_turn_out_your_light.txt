Very nearly caught me out that time
but let me win that's a memory of mine
time caught up with you too soon
and I cried enough tears to put oceans on the moon

Don't turn out your light
don't turn out your light
Don't turn out the light that
I see shining from you to me
It's so real

It's been four years since you've been gone
but you touch me in the night and
in me you live on

Don't turn out your light...

Grandad's son you're on my min
You're everywhere
didn't know I'd miss you so
till you weren't there

Don't turn out your light...

Times we shared together seem so few
And oh what I'd do for more time with you
