Six o'clock in the morning
Still walking the floor
We should have been talking
Instead of closing the door

Instead of going crazy tonight
Should have thought about getting it right

Cos this is wot I did
While you were foolin' around
This is wot I did
You were making no sound
This is wot I did
It just don't seem right
And if you think this is over
I won't give in
I just won't give in

Seems that we're getting restless
I'd better knock on the door
See if you're still sleeping
And ask you what it's all for

Instead of getting out of your head
Should have thought about the things you said

Cos this is wot I did
While you were foolin' around
This is wot I did
You were making no sound
This is wot I did
It just don't seem right
And if you think this is over
I won't give in, no no
I won't give in

Cos this is wot I did
While you were foolin' around
This is wot I did
You were making no sound
This is wot I did
It just don't seem right
And if you think this is over

Cos this is wot I did
While you were foolin' around
This is wot I did
You were making no sound
This is wot I did
It just don't seem right
And if you think this is over
I won't give in
I just won't give in
I just won't give in
No, no, no, no
I just won't give in
