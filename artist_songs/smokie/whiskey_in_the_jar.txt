As I was going over Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was countin'
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said "Stand and deliver or the devil he may take you"

My shirigim duraham da
Wack for my daddy oh, wack for my daddy oh
There's whiskey in the jar oh

I took on all his money and it was a pretty penny
I took on all his money and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she loved me and never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman 'cause you know she tricked me easy

My shirigim duraham da
Wack for my daddy oh, wack for my daddy oh
There's whiskey in the jar oh

Feeling drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber
Taking my money with me but I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven it was captain Farrell
I jumped up and found all my pistols and I shot him with the barrels

My shirigim duraham da
Wack for my daddy oh, wack for my daddy oh
There's whiskey in the jar oh

Now some men like the fishing and some men like to travel
And some men like to hear the cannon ball a roaring
But me - I like sleeping specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison here I am with a ball and chain, yeah

My shirigim duraham da
Wack for my daddy oh, wack for my daddy oh
There's whiskey in the jar oh

I got drunk on whiskey
And I love and I love and I love my Molly.
