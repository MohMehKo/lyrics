Maybe I'm a loner,
Maybe I'm a man,
Maybe I'm a fool,
But tried to understand.
I've been a dreamer,
And I've been around,
And I've spent my time
In many lonesome towns.

I used to know a woman,
I used to know a child,
Sometimes she was so gentle,
Sometimes she'd be so wild.
I gave her all my lovin,
And I gave her all my youth,
So certain of the future,
So sure we found the truth.

San Francisco Bay,
Where my love and I did run away,
We were looking for another day,
But we couldn't find the words to say...
San Francisco Bay,
All the flowers that we gave away,
Didn't know our sky was turning gray,
We were so young in San Francisco Bay.

So you see my darling,
Just why I've been so strange,
I've had so many heartaches,
It's hard for me to change.
So when you talk of lovin,
And going away with me,
I still can't help remembering
The way things used to be...

San Francisco Bay,
Where my love and I did run away,
We were looking for another day,
But we couldn't find the words to say...
San Francisco Bay,
All the flowers that we gave away,
Didn't know our sky was turning gray,
We were so young in San Francisco Bay.

San Francisco Bay,
Where my love and I did run away,
We were looking for another day,
But we couldn't find the words to say...
San Francisco Bay,
All the flowers that we gave away,
Didn't know our sky was turning gray,
We were so young in San Francisco Bay.
