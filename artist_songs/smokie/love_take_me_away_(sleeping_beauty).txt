The thousand years she sleeped in bed
No one comes near, no one there
He's riding like the wind through the night
He's riding hard just to be by her side
The thousand years she stayed the same
Frozen in time, nothing has changed
His heart implied on the wind through the night
To kiss her lips, to restore her life
She's dreaming, she's crying

Love, take me away
Love, release these chains
Caress me like the wind
Hold me in your arms again
Ohhh, caress me, hold me close
Never let go

The Gods watch over them this night
True love will last, true love will shine
Yeah... Their chosen plied on the wind through the night
Two hearts as one,
Beating in time, playing:

Love, take me away
Love, can read me say
Caress me like the wind
Hold me in your arms again
Ohhh, caress me, hold me close
Never let go
