Love hurts, love scars, love wounds and mars
Any heart not tough or strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud, holds a lot of rain

Love hurts
Love hurts

I may be slow, but even so
I know a thing or two, I've learned from you
I've really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a flame, burns you when it's hot

Love hurts
Love hurts
Love hurts

Some fools rave of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
They're not fooling me

But I know it isn't true
Well, I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue

Love hurts
Love hurts
Love hurts

Well, I know it isn't true
Well, I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue

Love hurts
Love hurts
Love hurts
