They say when love comes
It's something so good
But I've seen love come and go
'Cause baby
I've been in love once
With someone special
And I saw love walk out the door

Can't you see that I was

Hurting deep down inside
Trying to hide my pride
Straighten out in my mind
Longing to make things right?
Countless times I have cried
Laid awake endless nights
Reliving the bad times
Longing to make it right

They say when love comes
Love means so much
But will love last? I have my doubts
So baby
I don't want to
Want to need you
Just so you can let me down

'Cause I've been

Hurting deep down inside
Trying to hide my pride
Straighten out in my mind
Longing to make things right
Countless times I have cried
Laid awake endless nights
Reliving the bad times
Longing to make it right

'Cause, baby
I've been in love once
With someone special
And I saw love walk out the door

Can't you see that I was

Hurting deep down inside
Trying to hide my pride
Straighten out in my mind
Longing to make things right
Countless times I have cried
Laid awake endless nights
Reliving the bad times
Longing to make it right
