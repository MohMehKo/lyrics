See the light that shines forever
Through the open sky
Make you needed me where the needed you
And without your comfort I would die

You're a lady, you're a lady
And you know you take me so high

For the other misty valleys
Trough the steepy shore
Time to stand up and be counted
And you know my presence is all yours

You're a lady
You're a lady

You're a lady, you're a lady
And you know you take me so... high

You're a lady, you're a lady
And you know you take me so high

See the light that shines forever
Through the open sky
Make you needed me...
