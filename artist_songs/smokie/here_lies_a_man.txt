Here lies a man
Hold him in your hand
Make a game, love
Just the same
Did you have to make him take the blame?

Oh it's a shame
Can you explain?
Why you left love
At the hour
When his life was slowly turning sour?

Still he's waiting for the day
You will come, and you will say
Listen, listen, listen to me
And you'll see you're the one for me

And time goes on
You're the only one
To change your mind love
Change your life
If you only look for love then love you'll find
If you only look for love then love you'll find
