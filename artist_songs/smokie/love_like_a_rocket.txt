I know that my love
Don't come with a lot
And after my name
I got no letters to say
Oh how hard I've tried to make it for you girl
Just to see you, see you walk away
But if it's love you want
then it's love you got
Love like a rocket
Like a rocket to your heart
Into the sun
and a million stars
Love like a rocket

No other man on earth can go this far
Like a rocket to your heart
all the times I tried
all the words I couldn't find
whenever I'm this close to you
Feels like there's so much to lose
I know you see a hard road in me
But if you look deeper so much deeper babe
You'll find somethin' that you nee
'cos if it's love you want
Then it's love you got
Love like a rocket
Like a rocket to your heart
Into the sun
and a million stars
Love like a rocket
Like the one you always dream of
Everytime you close your eyes
Like a love that's gonna last you for all time
Oh how hard I've tried to make it for you girl
just to see you, see you walk away
so if it's love you want
then it's love you got
Love like a rocket...
Love like a rocket...
