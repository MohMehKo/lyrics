In a smoke filled room in a back ally bar
With a fiddle in song against Paddy's guitar
And the stakes get raised where the black stuff's praised
Those were my Celtic days

Well my second hand shoes ain't got no value
But a part time job will bring in what I need
Cause my school books I had to steal or borrow
So my school days, were few and far between

In a smoke filled room in a back ally bar
With a fiddle in song against Paddy's guitar
The stakes get raised where the black stuff's praised
Those were my Celtic days

Lismoe-ahan somedays would seem so empty
We'd watch the longboats bringing in the grain
We three brothers sitting down and plans aplenty
The end result we all agreed would be the same

Cause in a smoke filled room in a back ally bar
With a fiddle in song against Paddy's guitar
The stakes get raised where the black stuff's praised
Those were my Celtic days

The three of us somehow we made the distance
The rolling hills afar the sea is getting near
The war is over, work is all we're seeking
Not long now we'll be sat down sipping beer

Cause in a smoke filled room in a back ally bar
With a fiddle in song against Paddy's guitar
The stakes get raised where the black stuff's praised
Those were my Celtic days

In a smoke filled room in a back ally bar
With a fiddle in song against Paddy's guitar
The stakes get raised where the black stuff's praised
Those were my Celtic days, yeah
Those were my Celtic days
