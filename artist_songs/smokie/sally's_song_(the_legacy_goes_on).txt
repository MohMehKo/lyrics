Sally's gone and I still don't know why
She left me in the morning didn't even say "Goodbye"
Don't know why she left me
Don't know where she is, she didn't say
She just left a note that said "I'm sorry"
Left her key and walked away

Sally doesn't live here anymore
Took her heart and walked right out the door
Left me here with nothing but some worn out 45s
Don't ask me why she left or where she'd go
Don't ask me how she is, cause I don't know
Sally doesn't live here anymore

Now three weeks gone since Sally hit the road
I guess she had her reasons but I just don't wanna know
And all her friends keep calling wondering
If I know where she might be
Well I've heard that someone's seen her
But she sure ain't here with me

Cause Sally doesn't live here anymore
Took her heart and walked right out the door
Left me here with nothing but some worn out 45s
Don't ask me why she left or where she'd go
Don't ask me how she is, cause I don't know
Sally doesn't live here anymore

She always used to say she'd never leave me for another
Always used to say she'd never ever let me down
Now she's gone, she's gone

Don't ask me why she left or where she'd go
Don't ask me how she is, cause I don't know
Cause Sally doesn't live here anymore

Sally doesn't live here anymore
Took her heart and walked right out the door
Left me here with nothing but those worn out 45s
Don't ask me why she left or where she'd go
Don't ask me how she is, cause I don't know
Sally doesn't live here anymore
Sally doesn't live here anymore
Sally doesn't live here anymore
