Quiet night, lonely night
As I lay with the bedside light
Shining down on the pillow
You once laid upon
I dreamed I see
I have visions of you still with me
That's all I've got left
To live on
Why don't you come home oh darling
Come on home
Come on home
Oh I can't live without your loving anymore
Please won't you come home sweet darling
Come on home home home
Come on home
I'm lost without you now
If I could make up to you somehow
I'd give you the love you always dreamed of
I wait each day hoping you'd come on home and stay
I'll give the love you can be sure of
Why don't you come home oh darling...
Quiet night (quiet night)
Lonely night (lonely night)
As I lay with the bedside light
Shining down on the pillow
You once lay upon
You once lay upon baby
I dream (I dream)
I see (I see)
I have visions of you still with me
That's all I got left
To live on
That's all I got left
Why don't you come home oh darling...
Why don't you come home oh darling...
