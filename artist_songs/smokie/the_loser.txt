Lying in bed with a pain in my head
Reading a book that's already been read
What a feeling
Hearing no sound and I'm looking around
My thoughts are behind me
And I like to jump to the ceiling

But you would jump too
You would jump too
If it happened to you
In my life, what a pride

Back in my bed with a feeling of dread
Than I caught the smell and suddenly said
I'm on fire
Open a window and threw myself out
Jump to the ground
And hitting no burning tire

But you would jump too
You would jump too
If it happened to you
In my life, what a pride

Must have been born a loser
No picker or chooser
Who would want to be me
I'm a loser you see
I'm a loser

Went out on a date, we didn't stay late
I had a few drinks, and than I felt great
Feeling real nice
Met a girl in a pub and bought her some grub
Made love in a tube in a feeling of dub
And I mixed twice

But you would jump too
You would jump too
If it happened to you
In my life, what a pride

Must have been born a loser
No picker or chooser
Who would want to be me
I'm a loser you see
I'm a loser

I'm a loser
I love to go wandering along the mountain track
I'm a loser babe
I'm a loser, yeah, yeah
I'm a loser
