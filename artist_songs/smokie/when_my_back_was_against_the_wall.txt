When my back was against the wall, she called me names
When I was feeling small, she called me names
Molly said she had to go, it don't seem right
Just when I was feeling low, we had to fight
Don't you know, don't you know
Don't you know, don't you now
Gladly I would give a piece of mind to live without her
Gladly I would give a piece of mind to live without her
when my sky was turning grey, she'd bring me down
Couldn't face another day, she'd bring me down
Well many times she said she'd go, but she would stay
I didn't really think that she would go away
Don't you know, don't you know...
When my confidence was low, she'd turn away
Didn't know which way to go, she'd turn away
