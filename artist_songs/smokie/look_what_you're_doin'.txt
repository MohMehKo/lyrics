You say you don't like all the parties
Or sittin' around with all your kind
You're just another lonely woman
But look what you're doin' to my mind

A money tree is what you ask for
But you can't take what you don't find
I'm just another lonely fellow
But look what you're doin' to my mind

I think I must be going crazy
'Cause it don't work that way at all
And money doesn't buy you happiness
Looks like it's time to take my fall

So now it looks this all is ending
Shallow dreams have flown away
It was a love we both pretended
Now look what you're doin'
I said look what you're doin'
Oh, look what you're doin' to my mind
