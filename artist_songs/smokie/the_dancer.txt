Jeanette was a dancer
Suppose I knew her well
Her feet danced miracles
I was deep within her spell

Jeanette loved a singer
Who was the leader of some band
Looked just like a boy
And stood just like a man

And it rains on
Down deep
Avenue

Yes it rains on
Down deep
Avenue
Just for you boy [x2]

The kids in the backstreet cried
The voices in your brain
A world full of hungry souls
Behind the window pane
Little Jenny on the high wire
So emotioned as she felt
Sometimes I think that the wires mean
The tragedy as well

And it rains on
Down deep
Avenue

Yes it rains on
Down deep
Avenue
Just for you boy [x3]

I walked on the west-side
Jeanette I pulled your strings
I stood on the pavement
Never doing a thing
Still I'm a singer
I know my songs so well
The rain falls through my eyes
Lands below the share

And it rains on
Down deep
Avenue

Yes it rains on
Down deep
Avenue
Just for you boy [x4]
