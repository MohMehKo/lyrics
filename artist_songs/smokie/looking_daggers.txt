Just a glance from you
Stopped me in my tracks
Then you turned on
A full frontal attack
And it's all I can do
To look in your face
It's the look of love
The thrill of the chase

Do you like looking daggers at me
Does it hurt you or does it come naturally
Do you like looking daggers at me
Drag yourself over, sit down and cut me

Well inside and out
I feel as cold as ice
Oh, and I'm not asking
For a shower of rice
It's hard to believe
The way you're treating me
You don't have to fight
You can still beat me

Do you like looking daggers at me
Is it something you feed on, is it necessary
Do you like looking daggers at me
Drag yourself over, sit down and cut me

It's the look of love
The look of love
The thrill of the chase

Now you know my heart
Is ready to explode
And you got all my feelings
On sensually the old road
And it's all I can do
To look in your face
It's the look of love
The thrill of the chase

Do you like looking daggers at me
Does it hurt you or does it come naturally
Do you like looking daggers at me
Drag yourself over, sit down and cut me

Do you like looking daggers at me
Is it something you feed on, is it necessary
Do you like looking daggers at me
Drag yourself over, sit down and cut me

Do you like looking daggers at me
Does it hurt you or does it come naturally
Do you like looking daggers at me
Drag yourself over, sit down and cut me
