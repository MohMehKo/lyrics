Remember the days I used to bring you roses
Remember the ways I used to hold you close to me
Now they're gone and I've lost my time
Never more will you be mines
Remember the days I used to send you flowers
Remember the calls that used to last for hours
Now they're gone so I take the fall
Get my chance to take it all
I, I really missed you
I, I need to kiss you
Please change your mind and find the time to call
I, I feel so hazy
You, you drive me crazy
Please change your mind and we can have it all
it wasn't so long ago you called me darling
I was your blue eyed boy,
you were my only toy
Now they're gone and I've lost my time
Never more will you be mine
