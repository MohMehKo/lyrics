Sometimes I'm up, Sometimes I'm down
I feel I'm always hanging round
Cause I'm in love with you
Yeah I'm in love with you
You make it clear I have to leave
Cause you're the one that I deceived
But I'm in love with you
Yeah I'm in love with you
You believe in your own little way that
I wanted to come back and see
All the feelings you're trying to hide
In your eyes I can see that your heart is still beating for me
You believe in your own little way that
I wanted to come back and see
All the feelings you're trying to hide
In your eyes I can see that your heart is still beating for me
If I were gone what would you do
Would you find somebody new
When I'm in love with you
And well you know its true
I'll get along all my myself
Cause I don't want nobody else
When I'm in love with you
When I'm in love with you
Cause I'm in love with you
Cause I'm in love with you
Cause I'm in love with you
Cause I'm in love with you
