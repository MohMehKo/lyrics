Four gray walls that surround me
A silhouette upon the floor
Paper roses around my window
An iron curtain for my door

I cast my mind back to remember
The day I saw you standing there
With another man beside you
You didn't seem to really care

So your room was dark and sheltered
With another man, not me
Couldn't stand the pain inside me
But I was just too blind to see

You never can forgive me
For the foolish thing I've done
I won't be here to hear you
Cause I'll be dead before the morning comes

You never can forgive me
For the foolish thing I've done
I won't be here to hear you
Cause I'll be dead before the morning comes

Walk between the narrow cell block
Down the hallway to the stair
Because I killed the man you loved so
Now I face the electric chair
