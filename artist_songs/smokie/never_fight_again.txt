How can you feel a heartbeat pounding in a broken dream
When all your senses are numb
How can you feel emotion for another one night love affair
When a love affair has just begun

Now you don't have to compromise
Just look at me as I stare in your eyes

Threw away the night moves that affected just me deep and strong
And made you feel ashamed
Reload your heart from my side, cover up all cracks and seams
Than retake your aim

What was I supposed to do
You got me and I'm sure I got you

I tell you

You and I will never fight again
You and I will always stay the same
Take a care of love you cannot buy
You and I will never say goodbye

You walked the streets at night, I'd stay awake till you came home
I guessed you knew you were wrong
You played your game with all those fancy words and rolling eyes
And than you'll be gone

Now that we know the truth
You still got me and I know I got you

I tell you

You and I will never fight again
You and I will always stay the same
Take a care of love you cannot buy
You and I will never say goodbye

So how can you feel a heartbeat pounding in that broken dream
When all your senses are numb
And how can you feel emotion for another one night love affair
When that love affair has just begun

What was I supposed to do
Just spent my life being broken by you

I tell you

You and I will never fight again
You and I will always stay the same
Take a care of love you cannot buy
You and I will never say goodbye

You and I will never fight again
You and I will always stay the same
Take a care of love you cannot buy
You and I will never say goodbye
