I need you, but I know that you fool around
You're the best thing that I have and it's breaking me 'cause it's breaking down
Well I loved you before, and you can be sure, it's a hell of a place to be
And you said to me that I won't get another chance
Well you loved me once, and I loved you twice and you never listen to my voice
If you're strong enough, then you'll never be the second choice

It's daybreak the sun is rising across the hill
And I'm so afraid to wake just in case you might not be laying there still
Well I told you last night that I'll get it right, as a lover I'll be on my knees
And you said to me that I won't get another chance
Well you loved me once, but I loved you twice, and you never listen to my voice
If you're strong enough, then you'll never be the second choice

He's crying, she's lying
Hearts aching, souls breaking
Will this be his lucky day
Over and over
Her head on his shoulder
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

I need you and I knew that you would let me down
You're the best thing that I have and it's breaking me 'cause it's broken down
Well I told you last night that I'll get it right, as a lover I'll be on my knees
And you said to me that I won't get another chance
Well you loved me once, but I loved you twice, and you never listen to my voice
If you're strong enough, then you'll never be the second choice
