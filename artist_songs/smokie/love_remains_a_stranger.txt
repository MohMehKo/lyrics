You spend a hundred dollar bill as if it were a dime
Seem so debonair while you sip your wine
Brag about your escapades, to impress your best friend's wife
Cos love remains a stranger in your life 

You try to cure your loneliness with expensive luxuries
Your sense of values have been driven to their knees
A chauffeur and a limousine, you're a rich man poor at heart
Cos love remains a stranger in the dark 

Love remains a stranger
Loneliness comes screaming from your eyes
The truth, it hurts so bad you resolve to telling lies
Cos love remains a stranger from the skies 

Love remains a stranger
Love remains a stranger 

You spoke of having a woman once and how you made her bleed
You're so into yourself you ignored her every need
Oh, she bent over backwards to keep you but your ego made her crawl
She left with a lonely stranger through it all 

Love remains a stranger
Loneliness comes screaming from your eyes
The truth, it hurts so bad you resolve to telling lies
Cos love remains a stranger in disguise 

Love remains a stranger
Love remains a stranger
