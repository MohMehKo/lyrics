Well, it's a no good complain
and the things are the same as they used to be
When the cut of the close cut sharper than a knife
Darlin' back for days mean so much to me
It was more than a dancehall, more a way of life

Cause all them voisler dancing all through the night
Fresh from working down on the cold
And those pretty faces in the flashing lights
They put the magic into my Northern Soul
Ohhh...

Well I went back of London and looked at the heart of a nation
But I spent my time looking over my shoulder and freedom
Everyone tells me that this is the right situation
Ohhh, but the hearts of the nation is missing whenever I need them

Cause all them voisler dancing all through the night
Fresh from working down on the cold
And those pretty faces in the flashing lights
They put the magic into my Northern Soul
Ohhh...
