She's a lonely rider on a lonely road
A street survivor, a one man show
Drive by the eyes of a stranger in the night
Ooh never felt so good, never felt so right

I said come home baby let me take you home
I wanna rock you all night long
Come on and hold me tight

Well it all boils down to rock'n'roll
You got a whole lot of love, a heart full of soul
Do all the things that you do so well
Just keep it this way, don't want nobody else

You've gotta hold on tight to what you've got
Hold on tight to what you've got, to what you've got
Hold on tight to what you've got

Another reckless heart in a changing world
Another worn out lover gets his fingers burned
Well that's the price of love and that's the debt you pay
Ooh baby love can be dangerous playing your kind of game

You gave me all, you gave me hell
Never had a lover I've known so well
Come on and hold me tight

Well it all boils down to rock'n'roll
You got a whole lot of love, a heart full of soul
Do all the things that you do so well
Just keep it this way, don't want nobody else

You've gotta hold on tight to what you've got
Hold on tight to what you've got, to what you've got
Hold on tight to what you've got

Come on everybody
Listen
Hold on, hold on
I'm gonna make you
Hold on, hold on

You've gotta hold on tight to what you've got
Hold on tight to what you've got, to what you've got
Hold on tight, c'mon hold on tight
Hold on tight to what you've got
To what you've got, to what you've got, to what you've got
To what you've got, to what you've got, to what you've got
To what you've got, to what you've got, to what you've got
To what you've got, to what you've got, to what you've got
