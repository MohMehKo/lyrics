Love sometimes takes time
Sometimes love don't come easy
And sometimes love is hard to find
And sometimes love moves like ships through the night
Love sometimes takes time
Sometimes words almost freeeze me
And sometimes words take my breath away
And sometimes words keep playing games with my mind
Love sometimes takes time
Love sometimes takes time
So as we walk on through the shadows of the night
Making love through our eyes
There's a fire burning deep inside our hearts
There's a cloud hanging over me
And I can say what I'm feeling
Love isn't a crime
Love sometimes takes time
Love sometimes takes time
Sometimes love don't come easy
When words are hard to fin
And sometimes love moves like ships through the night
Love sometimes takes time
Well as we walk on through the shadows of the night
Making love through our eyes
There's a fire still burning deep inside our hearts
There's a cloud hanging over me
I can say what I'm feeling
Just give me a sign
Love sometimes takes time
Love sometimes takes time
