If you find a new direction
And if you feel that I'm the one
Baby I'm too shy to mention
The way you always turn me on

If you need some close attention
And if you want someone to care
Communicate your intention
Say the word and I'll be there

And I don't understand
But I feel like a man
And nobody else can do
What you do to me
Do to me
Do to me Baby
Do to me
Do to me Baby

Do to me do do do to me
I said do to me do do do do to me

I'll offer you my dedication
Though what you do is hard to say
You make me feel a new sensation
Every time you look my way

I don't need your conversation
And I don't want your sympathy
Try to find an explanation
The way you do these things to me

And I don't understand
But I feel like a man
And nobody else can do
What you do to me
Do to me
Do to me Baby
Do to me
Do to me Baby
