Well now that I'm leaving
Well now that I'm going home
It's hard for me to believe in
All those words now that I'm all alone
I'm going home, I'm going home
There were times when I had me shaking
Oh times like I have never known
Oh you know that I was mistaken
'Cos you see my ego was overgrown
I'm going home, I'm going home
I'm going home where I can find it
To a place that's been on my mind
It seems I've been there before
I know where I've been
But maybe I've only seen it in my dreams
There ain't no reason in my life
But Lord, there's an answer
There ain't no reason in my life
There must be an answer
I'm going home, I'm going home
Dazed but still on reflection
Oh I guess that I was born to roam
So amazed that my recollection
I know that where I'll be my home
I'm going home, I'm going home
There ain't no reason in my life,life,
I'm going home
Lord there ain't no reason in my life, life
There's an answer
Midnight dreamer don't understand
Restless sleeper ain't got no plans
Ain't no reasons but there's a way
There's an answer find it today
I'm going home, I'm going home
