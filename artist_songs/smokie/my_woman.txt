When I'm with my woman I'm content
the peace and the love
that she gives me is Heaven send
Just to be beside her is all I need
I feel so warm just to tough her
I do indeed
and oh how I love her,
Oh how I do

I can think of nothing I'd rather do
To spend all my life with my woman
you know it's true
and oh how I love her
Oh how I do

to spend a day without her can worry me
I think about her and want her constantly
Oh how I love her
Oh how I do

when I'm with my woman I'm content
the peace and the love
that she gives me is Heaven sent
