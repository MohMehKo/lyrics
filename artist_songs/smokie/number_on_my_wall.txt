I've got your number on my wall if that's alright
And I need someone to call cause I'm feeling lonely tonight
Tonight
You were standing by yourself in a fancy dress
And you were looking out for long with no one to impress
I guess

Well there ain't no doubt about it
When you're gone away from home
And the only one's who know it have all gone
If you wanna know the truth my friend
I'm on fire
I got your number on my wall

A mistake of other taste and tasty too
When I needed an embrace, oh where were you
Where were you
Well you said give me a call but I didn't possess
But I'm looking on my wall cause I can't resist
Can't resist

Well there ain't no doubt about it
When you're sitting on your own
And the only friends you needed have all gone
When the feeling takes you over
You're on fire
Got your number on my wall

Got your number on my wall if that's alright
And I need someone to call cause I'm feeling lonely tonight
Tonight
You were standing by yourself in a fancy dress
And you were looking out for long with no one to impress
I guess

Well there ain't no doubt about it
When you're gone away from home
And the only one's who know it have all gone
If you wanna know the truth my friend
I'm on fire
Got your number on my wall
Got your number on my wall
Got your number on my wall
