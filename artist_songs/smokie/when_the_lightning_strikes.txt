It's close to midnight
There's a chill in the air
I long to touch you
but I don't dare
there's a wall between us
there's a storm in the air
though you're lying beside me
It's like you're not even there
When the lightning strikes
I don't want to be here
when the cold wind bites
I don't want to be here
Ooh it hurts me
though we won't be talking
I hear every word you say
Now the rain is falling
Like a million tears
Coming through my window
To wash away the years
When the lightning strikes...
Oh can you feel it
there's a storm in the air
and it's getting nearer
when the cloud breaks
I don't want to be here
to feel the rain
feel the pain
There's a wall between us
There's a storm in the air
though you're lying beside me
It's like you're not even there
When the lightning strikes
Oh can you feel it
there's a storm in the air
And it's getting nearer
when the cloud breaks
I don't want to be here
to feel the rain
When the lightning strikes...
When the lightning strikes...
