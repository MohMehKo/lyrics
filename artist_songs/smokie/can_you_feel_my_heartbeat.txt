In the barroom on the corner
The first I saw my true love
A smile so warm and gentle
And she slowly passed me by
From the shadow of the doorway
I heard her softly whisper
As I turned and looked towards her
Saw the sparkle in her eye
She said oh you are a dreamer
And your heart is all you offer
And I may be in danger
Of becoming a dreamer too
I always will remember
In that dark and dusty corner
How we spent that time together
How awful if we'd been seen
The first time that ever I saw your face
I got so excited
I swore that I never would leave this place
Took so long to find it
Can you feel my heartbeat
Can you feel it calling you
The first time that ever I saw your face
I got so excited
I swore that I never would leave this place
Took so long to find it
Can you feel my heartbeat......
