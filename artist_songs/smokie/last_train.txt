So I'm standing at the station
For trains that never show
I could hear where you were coming from
and how was I to know
It's so cold and lonely here
and it's miles from where we were
so I'm waiting for the last train
coming in
Take me home on the last train
to the place I love so dear
to my baby's arms
To my baby's smile
A million miles from here
So I'm flicking through the pages
Of a womans magazine
Reading for the stories
sure that's where I've been
they say he was your love
The new guy always wins
So I'm waiting for the last train
Coming in
Take me home on the last train..
won't you take me take me home
on the last train
Take me home on the last train
it's so cold and lonely here
And it's miles from where we were
Now I'm waiting for the last train
Coming in
Take me home on the last train
Take me home on the last train...
won't you take me home
(Take me home)
just take me home
(Take me home)
