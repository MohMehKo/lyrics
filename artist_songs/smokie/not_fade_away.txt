I'm goin' to tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
Love I ask for more than a day
Love is love and not fade away
Said, love is love and not fade away

My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but it drives me mad
Your love for me has got to be real
I want you to know just how I feel
Said, love is real and not fade away

I'm goin' to tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
Love I ask for more than a day
Love is love and not fade away
Said, love is love and not fade away

Said love is love and not fade away
Not fade away
Not fade away
