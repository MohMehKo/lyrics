Like a Caribbean Sunset
your eyes they shine'
And from the first time we met
I swore you'd be mine
I saw you by the hotel bar
I saw you waiting there
you were cool as a cat
I could tell you were unaware
A thousand eyes upon you,
just waiting for the kill
It's all in the thrill of the chase
They're playing it still
Like a Rock'n'Roll Rodeo
it's part of the game
Like a Rock'n'Roll Rodeo
They're staking their claim
Like a Rock'n'Roll Rodeo
They'll never give in
Like a Rock'n'Roll Rodeo
They're all out to win
they're all out to win
I was waiting for the last song
waiting patiently
Planning tomake my move
when I saw you smile at me
Like a Caribbean Sunset,
your eyes they shine
and I'll never forget
'cos I knew you'd be mine
A thousand eyes upon you
just waiting for the kill
It's all in the thrill of the chase
We're playing it still
Like a Rock'n'Roll Rodeo...
It's all in the thrill of the chase
They're all out to win
