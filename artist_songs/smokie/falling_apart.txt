Empty ships that sail away
Empty nights, empty days
I see the tears behind your smile
We're lost in time

Falling apart...

Empty ships lost at sea
Empty hearts, you and me
There was no storm, there was no sound
But our love has run on ground

It's falling apart
All hands on deck
We're falling apart
My love is a wreck

Harbour lights so far away
Empty nights, lonely days
Empty sails so taut, so still
Does this love have no will

It's falling apart
All hands on deck
We're falling apart
My love is a wreck

Can't you hear my SOS
Can't you see we're in distress
All that's left is an empty shell
Can't you hear the lootin' bell

Empty ships that sail away
lonely nights, lonely days
There was no storm there was no sound
But our love has run on ground

It's falling apart
All hands on deck
We're falling apart
My love is a wreck...
