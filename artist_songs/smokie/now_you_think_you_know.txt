I used to know her well when we were kids
I still remember all the things we did
And now the grey has gone and I'm alone
I'll find a way to carry on

She had a power on me through all my days
We loved each other in so many ways
But now she's gone from me, that's the price I had to pay
I'll keep on loving her each day

Now you think you know the trouble with my heart
You tried hard to use it then tore it apart
And as time goes by my memory goes on
The love that we shared I know now has gone

I get so tired of having sleepless nights
I try to tell myself that I was right
I live in hope to find her by my side
Till then I'll try to keep alive

Now you think you know the trouble with my heart
You tried hard to use it then tore it apart
And as time goes by my memory goes on
The love that we shared I know now has gone
