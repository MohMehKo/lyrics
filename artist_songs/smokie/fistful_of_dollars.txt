You wanna dream, son
Well I can make you one
I'll take you higher than you ever thought you'd go
Yes, I can make you
And I can break you
I make the rules, you pay your dues
And don't forget it, son

You'll be a big shot
I'll make you so hot
You'll rise so fast
Your feet won't ever touch the ground
Be the main man, centre attraction
Number one I see it's done
The greatest thing around

Here's a man with a fistful of dollars in his hand
Telling me just what I gotta sing
But he don't understand I just can't think like the man
I don't wanna be a puppet on a string
No puppet on a string

So here's the rules boy,
You'll be my toy
You'll be style, be the fashion, be the trend
I'll take you so far,
You'll be a big star
You pay your dues,
Forget the rules
Cause they were made to bend

Yes, you'll be so big
'Cause I can fix it
I can make you everything you wanna be
You'll be the news boy,
Teenagers' new toy
A private jet, you'll be the set
Leave everything to me

Here's a man with a fistful of dollars in his hand
Telling me just what I gotta sing
But he don't understand I just can't think like the man
I don't wanna be a puppet on a string

Doesn't matter what you say or do
He knows what you're reaching for
There is a getting everything you want,
Everything you dream of

Here's a man with a fistful of dollars in his hand
Telling me just what I gotta sing
But he don't understand I just can't think like the man
I don't wanna be a puppet on a string
