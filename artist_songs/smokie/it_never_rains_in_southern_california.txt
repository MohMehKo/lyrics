Got on aboard a west bound seven forty seven
Didn't think before deciding what to do
All that talk of opportunities, TV breaks and movies
Rang true, sure rang true

Seems it never rain in Southern California
Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before
It never rains in California
But girl, don't they warn ya it pours, man, it pours

Out of work, I'm out of my head
Out of self respect, I'm out of bread
I'm under loved, I'm under fed
I wanna go home, it never rains in California
But girl don't they warn ya, it pours, man, it pours

Will you tell the folks back home I nearly made it?
Had offers but don't know which one to take
Please don't tell them how you found me
Don't tell them how you found me
Give me a break, give me a break

Seems it never rains in Southern California
Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before
It never rains in California
But girl, don't they warn ya it pours man it pours
