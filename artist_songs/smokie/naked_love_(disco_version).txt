I'll kiss your lips
My finger tips
Will know just what to do
Tonight's the night that I will find
The woman that's in you
I'll kiss you, caress you,slowly undress you
And we'll make love
All night through
Baby love me, lady love me
Like no one ever could
I can ever
Never ever
Get enough naked love
Don't try to fight
What's locked inside?
Just open up the door
Let me in, just give in
To what you waited for
I'll touch you, tease you
I'm here just to please you
And we have got
All night love
Hold on, be strong
You know it can't be wrong
Let love lead you
Let me show you the way, oh yea..
Baby love me, lady love me...
