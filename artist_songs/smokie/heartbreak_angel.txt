Show me a mountain, I will climb
Show me a river running wild
But don't break this heart
Don't waste my time
Still you carry on
Shooting your lines

I've been in high circles, travelled the world
Seen lots of places, met lots of girls
But the longest love I've known
Is the strongest, you should know

Heartbreak Angel
Heartbreak Angel
You're the best I've ever known
Heartbreak Angel
Heartbreak Angel
Don't leave me this way
Don't leave me alone

Show me a mountain, I will climb
Show me a river running wild
'Cause the longest love will grow
To the strongest
Just let your feelings show

Heartbreak Angel
Heartbreak Angel
You're the best I've ever known
Heartbreak Angel
Heartbreak Angel
Don't leave me this way
Don't leave me alone
