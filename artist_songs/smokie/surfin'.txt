Hold tight here it comes again
Get set for a fine weekend
The surfs up its down to you
To allow just what I'm gonna do
Life's a beach or so they say
I'm gonna ride that silver spray
Gonna catch a wave to ride all day
Yes I'm gonna go Surfin Surfin
Baby don't ya know
Let's go surfin A little rock and roll
Surfin surfin On the radio
Baby are you coming keep your motor running
Baby let it go We can take a ride
Surfin surfin We can ride the tide
Lets go surfin Yeah we're flying high
Surfin surfin This rollercoaster ride
Baby are you coming keep your motor running
Baby let it go
Can't wait for the rising tide
There's a breaker I'm gonna ride
I'm gonna feel like a bird in flight
Party on till the morning light
Life's a beach I know it's true
Come on girl, it's all to do

Yes I'm gonna go Surfin surfin...
Life's a beach or so they say
