The night we met I knew I needed you so
And if I had the chance I
Would never let you go
So won't you say you love me, 
I'll make you so proud of me
We'll make them turn the heads,
Everywhere we go

So won't you be
Be my little baby
Say you'll be my darling
Be my baby now
Oh

I'll make you happy baby
Just wait and see
For every kiss you give me, 
I'm gonna give you three
Since the day I saw you
I have been waiting for you
You know I will adore you
Till eternity

So won't you be
Be my little baby
Say you'll be my darling
Be my baby now
Oh
Be my little baby, 
Say you'll be my darling
Be my baby now

So won't you say you love me
I'll make you so proud of me
We'll make them turn their heads, 
Everywhere we go

So won't you be 
Be my little baby
Say you'll be my darling
Be my darling now
