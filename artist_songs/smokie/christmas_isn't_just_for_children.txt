Winter shades a distant light
Shining until the night has come and gone
When everyone on earth should be as one
Ooooo this night
People plan the day ahead
Reflecting on the feast that comes to mind
A blessing for the world and all mankind
Ooooo this night
Christmas isn't just for children
It's for the hearts of everyone around
Christmas isn't just for children
It's a time when happiness is found
All the year the fear in pain
Seems captured in a world that knows no hope
Left hanging in a noose without the rope
Oooo but then
Christmas isn't...
You and I we've come so far and still a light up in the sky
Shines so bright
We build our hopes and dreams for years to come
Let Christmas be the time for old and young
Christmas isn't just for children
Christmas isn't just for children
Christmas isn't just for children
Christmas isn't just for children
Christmas isn't just for children
Christmas isn't just for children
