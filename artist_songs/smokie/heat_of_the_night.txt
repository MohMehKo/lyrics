When I was young I had a dream
But dreams can be cold
If you know what I mean

It was such a magical mystery to me
Then you came along
So wild and so free

In the heat of the night
You wrapped your arms around me
And held me so tight
In the heat of the night
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
In the heat of the night

Got a burning desire
The very thought of you sets my heart on fire
No you won't let go
One look in your eyes, I can't say no

It all seemed a magical mystery to me
Then this new love was born
So wild and so free

In the heat of the night
You wrapped your arms around me
And held me so tight
In the heat of the night
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
In the heat of the night

It was just a magical mystery to me
Till you came along
So wild and so free

In the heat In the heat of the night
You wrapped your arms around me
And held me so tight
In the heat of the night
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
In the heat of the night
