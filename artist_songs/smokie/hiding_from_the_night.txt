Guess we're all just a little crazy now
Hanging out our winter clothes in spring
When times get rough it makes me feel so lazy
But it doesn't mean a thing

A butterfly can spread it's wings and fly away
A robin needs to sing
If I could find the words to make her wanna stay
Then a beggar would be king

Now she'll never come home
She's been hiding from the night
No, she'll never come home
She's been hiding from the night
She's been hiding from the night

Hidden deep within the sadness in her eye
I saw a teardrop glisten
I know I try to tell her
all things pass you by
She would never even listen

Now she'll never come home
She's been hiding from the night
No, she'll never come home
She's been hiding from the night
She's been hiding from the night

Well I guess we're all just a little different now
We're all hiding from the night
