Well the trees were shaking
in the terrible wind
And my face would have cracked
if I'd tried to grin
It was the coldest night
I've ever spent outside
the frost was biting like a hungry hound
and my feet were so numb
I couldn't feel the ground
It was the coldest night
I've ever spent outside

And I freeze,
you don't know what it's like
To be left all alone in the cold
On my knees
I'd go down on my knees
for a moment or two back at home

Still I walked on and on and on
Not really going any place
Just trying to keep me warm
It was the coldest night
I've ever spent outside
It near drove me insane
as the rain tapped my brain
Then fell to the floor and
ran down the drain
It was the coldest night
I've ever spent outside

And I freeze,..

Well if I ain't dead well
this sure feels like hell
And after all how can you tell
It was the coldest night
I've ever spent outside
It was hard to believe when
I woke up in a sweat
That I was only dreaming
of that cruel cold and wet
It was the coldest night
I've ever spent outside

And I freeze,...

In my bed rest my head where
I'm cosy and warm
