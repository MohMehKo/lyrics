Look at the train coming
Look at the train coming
Down the line
Look at the train coming
Look at the train coming
Down the line
Right on time
Look at the train, look at the train coming
Look at the train, look at the train, look at the train coming

Coming up fast
Don’t let it pass
Pack it all in

Now it’s meant apologizing
Train at platform one
Due to change your timetable
This train must carry on

High-end wheels keep turning
Engine keeps on turning fast

Look at the train coming
Look at the train coming
Over the hill
Look at the train coming
Look at the train coming
Over the hill
Looks quite still

Look at the train coming
Look at the train coming
Down the line
Look at the train coming
Look at the train coming
Down the line
Right on time
Look at the train, look at the train coming
Look at the train, look at the train, look at the train coming

Coming up fast
Don’t let it pass
Pack it all in

While in the waiting room
A next announcement cries
Sorry to keep you waiting
Your replacement has arrived

High-end wheels keep turning
Engine keeps on turning fast

Look at the train coming
Look at the train coming
Over the hill
Look at the train coming
Look at the train coming
Over the hill looks quite still
