I'll be waiting till you follow me
you gabe your loving so honestly
and I will love you, baby, endlessly
when yo come back, wait and see
When you left me I cried all the night
I didn't even put up a fight
but, you know, my darling, you were right
I never saw your guiding light
those other girls in town
they try to pin me down
Can't compare to your memory
Now I can't stand another day sat by the phone
so please come home, cos I'm so alone
I'll be waiting till you follow me
you gave you loving so honestly
And I will love you, baby, endlessly
When you come back, wait and see
when you come back, wait an see to me
when you come back, wait and see
when you come back
when you come back
