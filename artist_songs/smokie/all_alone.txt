When evening is drawing nigh
And the moon dances in the sky
And you've nothing to believe in
At all

When your room's full of emptiness
Just the memory of her caress
And you've nothing to believe in
At all

When you're all alone
When you're on your own
And you've always known
You were all alone

When you lie in your lonely room
Warm traces of her perfume
No reason for your being
At all

And when you wake into another day
And you remember she's gone away
No reason for your being
At all

When you're all alone
When you're on your own
And you've always known
You were all alone
