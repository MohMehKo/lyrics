Love, love is a stranger drifting through the night
With no sense of danger
Never letting go, like the wind she flies so free
All of my lightening inside, it can't be denied
The truth is there to see
Can't this be love, cause it's more than a feeling to me
More than a feeling believe me, I never dreamed this could be
Can't this be love
Can't this be love
Can't this be love
Oh Can't this be love
Love, love is a darkness, waiting for the light to shine
For them in silence
Capturing the time that only we can see
But the lightening inside it can't be denied
The truth was meant to be
Can't this be love...
So Can't this be love...
Cause it's more than a feeling to me
More than a feeling believe me, I never dreamed this could be
Can't this be love
Can't this be love
