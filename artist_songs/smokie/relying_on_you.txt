How could I be so dumb trying to make it alone
I was crazy to think I'd be fine on my own
I've wasted my time
Now I've finally started to shine
With the help that you give me
I now realise I can see it in you face
I can read in your eyes
When I think of the things that I've wanted to say
And the things that I wished I could do
Now it's all just a part of my life since relying on you
I'd hoped for a time when I might get it right
And the best of my dreams would come true
Now I'm finally seeing the sense in relying on you
Relying on you
I'd never believed when you hand turned to me
With the two of us here what a strength there would be
You've proved it to me
Now it's easy to see
How we're stronger together than just on our own
And we'll never again try to go it alone
When I think of the things that I've wanted to say...
When I think of the things that I've wanted to say...
