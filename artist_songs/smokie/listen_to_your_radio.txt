I'm getting tired of all of the same video's
And music machines
I'm getting bored of watching the same tv shows
It means nothing to me
There is a place I can go
Adjusted the dial start the show
I feel all right
Listen to your radio
Non-stop music radio
Tune into your favourite radio
Listen to your radio
Non-stop music radio
Play your favourite station radio
Play your radio
Driving my car no particular place to go
And nothing to see
Turned the dial heard the Beatles, the Kinks and the Stones
That's music to me
Cruising around with my girl
We've got no cares in the world
I feel all right
All right
Listen to your radio...
There is a place where I can go
Adjusted the dial start the show
I feel all right
All right
Listen to your radio...
Play your radio
Listen to your radio
Non-stop music radio
