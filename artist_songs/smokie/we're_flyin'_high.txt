Did you ever look down on an Egyptian plain
Did you ever look down upon the golden grain
and if you could find water on that Egyptian plain
Would you ever go back there again
and did you ever head out across the Aegean sea
Have you looked down on a sunrise in the east
And if you saw your reflection in that Aegean sea
Could it mean that that's where you were meant to be
But you and I, we're flyin' high
We'll touch the sky
We're flyin' high
Can you still see the water, can you still see the sands
Higher and higher away from the land
We were born in the waters, lost in the sands,
Now, we're flyin' high
