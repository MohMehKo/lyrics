Now that you have gone away
You'll find someone else to say
The same things to I never will believe in

But how was I to know
That you were never really so in love with me
As it was me who did the givin'

Now I'm on my own
And you're no longer coming home, well I can tell
I'm gonna miss you
Miss you, oh my love
I will love you
Love you for as long as you stay in my memory

I often think of times
I should have read between the lines
But then a man can only see the things he wants to

If there's one to blame 'tis I
'Cause I was such a simple guy
Oh, but that don't change the pain I feel inside me

I really wish I could
Just see your face instead of all this empty space
'Cause I miss you
Miss you, oh my love
I will love you
Love you for as long as you stay in my memory

Now I'm on my own
And you're no longer coming home, well I can tell
I'm gonna miss you
Miss you...
