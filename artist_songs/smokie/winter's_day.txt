A winter's day
And still the sun is shining in my eyes
Memories of you are on my mind
I'm missing you girl

Come what may
Though the autumn leaves have long time blown away
My love for you keeps growing day by day
I'm still missing you girl

And oh how I love you
I should never have left you
I will never forget you
My love, my love

A winter's day
And still the sun is shining in my eyes
Memories of you are on my mind
I'm still missing you girl

And oh how I love you
I should never have left you
I will never forget you
My love, my love

I'm missing you girl
Missing you
