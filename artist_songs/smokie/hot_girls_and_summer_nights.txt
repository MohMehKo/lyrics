I was cruisin', going nowhere
Turned the radio on
Then those memories came back to me
Like an old fashion song
Like it was yesterday
My mind just ran away
And I remember

Hot girls and summer nights
They seemed to last a lifetime
Oh when the moon was right
We'd float away
Hot girls and summer nights
Holding you in my arms
Heart beating next to mine
We'd float away

Passing by the empty beach
I stand alone for a while
There was one girl special to me
Oh, and she had some style
But that was yesterday
And yesterday is gone away
And I remember

Hot girls and summer nights
They seemed to last a lifetime
Oh when the moon was right
We'd float away
Hot girls and summer nights
Holding you in my arms
Heart beating next to mine
We'd float away

Hot girls and summer nights
They seemed to last a lifetime
Oh when the moon was right
We'd float away
Hot girls and summer nights
Holding you in my arms
Heart beating next to mine
We'd float away

Hot girls and summer nights
They seemed to last a lifetime
Oh when the moon was right
We'd float away
Hot girls and summer nights
Holding you in my arms
Heart beating next to mine
We'd float away
