I went to a garden party to reminisce with my old friends
A chance to share old memories and play our songs again
When I got to the garden party they all knew my name
But no one recognized me I didn't look the same

But it's all right now
I learned my lesson well
You see you can't please ev'ryone so
You got to please yourself

People came for miles around everyone was there
Yoko brought her walrus there was magic in the air
And over in the corner much to my surprise
Mr. Hughes hid in dylan's shoes wearing his disguise
I played them all the old songs I thought that's why they came
No one heard the music we didn't look the same
I said hello to mary lou she belongs to me
When I sang a song about a honky-tonk it was time to leave

Someone opened up a closet door and out stepped johnny b. Goode
Playing guitar like a ring an' a bell and lookin' like he should
If you gotta play at garden parties I wish you a lot a' luck
But if memories were all I sang I'd ratherdrive a truck
