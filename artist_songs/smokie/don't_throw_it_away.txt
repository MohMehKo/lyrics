I'm gonna give you one more chance for another one
Another chance to change your mind
You keep thinking still of the other one
Why can't you leave the past behind

What do I have to do to take your mind away
From the game you lost you still play
Why can't you take your mind off the other one
And take my hand for the second game

Can't you see I'm in love with you baby
With someone like you I could settle down
So don't throw it away
Don't throw this chance away
No, don't throw it away
I've longed to hear you say
You're gonna stay
So, don't throw it away

I've longed for the night I could lay with you
The sleepless night, tireless eyes
To hold you tight the way that lovers do
(The way that lovers do)
Until the early morning light

Can't you see I'm in love with you baby
With someone like you I could settle down
So don't throw it away
Don't throw this chance away
No, don't throw it away
I've longed to hear you say
You're gonna stay
So, don't throw it away
Don't throw this chance away
Don't throw it away
No, don't throw it away
Don't throw this chance away
