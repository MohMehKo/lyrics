Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible say
Mary’s boychild Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day.

Hark now here the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day
Trumpets sound, an angel sing
Listen what they say
That man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day.

While shepherds watch their flock by night
They see a brand new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song
The music seemed to come from a far.

Now Josef and his wife Mary
They come to Bethlehem that night
They find no place to bear the child
Not a single room was inside.

Hark now here the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day
Trumpets sound, an angel sing
Listen what they say
That man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day.
