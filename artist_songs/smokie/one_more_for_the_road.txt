I wake up each day feeling lonesome
The thoughts that I have give me pain
But you know I can't take all the heartache
Living all nights in my maim

You stood up and you told me you love me
I was too scared to hear anymore
But the words echoed round in my memory
So I turn and walked out the door 

So let's make it one more for the road
One more before I hit the floor
I was wrong not to stay
Guess I hurried away
Give me one more, one more for the road

Well I guess that you think I'm half crazy
I want you back here by my side
But I don't need a wife just to love her
So I don't go along for the ride

I wake up each day feeling lonesome
The thoughts that I have give me pain
You know I can't take all the heartache
Living all nights in my maim

Let's make it one more for the road
One more before I hit the floor
I was wrong not to stay
Guess I hurried away
Give me one more, one more for the road

One more for the road
One more for the road
One more for the road
One more for the road
