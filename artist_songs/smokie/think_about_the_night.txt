When you close your eyes
Think of what we had
Don't feel sadness, don't feel shame
'Cause we had true romance

Oh, we had it all
A love so bright
Like a diamond in the sky
Before you sleep and dreams unfold
Bear me in your mind

Think about the night
I held you in my arms
And think about the fire
That burns inside our hearts
Just think about the night

Kissed the tear from your eyes
I held you close to me
You whispered this is not goodbye
I'll come back, wait and see

Oh, we had it all
We have our dreams
We have the heavens up above
Before you sleep and dreams unfold
Think about our love

Think about the night
I held you in my arms
And think about the fire
that burns inside our hearts
Just think about the night
