O’ Christmas tree, o’ Christmas tree
How wonderful your branches
O’ Christmas tree, o’ Christmas tree
How wonderful your branches.

Not only green in summer time
But bravely green in winter time
O’ Christmas tree, o’ Christmas tree
How wonderful your branches.

O’ Christmas tree, o’ Christmas tree
The candles shine so brightly
O’ Christmas tree, o’ Christmas tree
The candles shine so brightly.

From base to solid they are bright
There’s only splendor for the sight
O’ Christmas tree, o’ Christmas tree
The candles shine so brightly.

O’ tannenbaum, o’ tannenbaum
How wonderful your branches
O’ Christmas tree, o’ Christmas tree
How wonderful your branches.

Not only green in summer time
But bravely green in winter time
O’ Christmas tree, o’ Christmas tree
How wonderful your branches.
