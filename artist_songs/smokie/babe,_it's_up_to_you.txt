Too many times I count the cost
Of the games that I played
And the love that I lost forever

So many ways a heart can lose
If you ain't got the love
That you can use together

You can love me tonight
While the feeling is right
Let me spend just one night with you
I could hold you so tight
If you say it's alright
And we'll love 'til the lights shine trough
Babe, it's up to you
Babe, it's up to you

You can love me tonight
While the feeling is right
Let me spend just one night with you
I could hold you so tight
If you say it's alright
And we'll love 'til the lights shine trough

So many times we tried to hide
All the broken hearts
And the tears we cried together

We had it all but love was lost
When you walked away
And I count the cost forever

With the tears in my eyes
And my heart how it cries
Let me spend just one night with you
Now I'm down on my knees
And I'm begging you please
Let me spend just one night with you

Babe, it's up to you
Babe, it's up to you
