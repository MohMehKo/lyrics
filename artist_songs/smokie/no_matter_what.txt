No matter what they tell us
No matter what they do
No matter what they teach us
What we believe is true

No matter how they call us
No matter how they attack
No matter where they take us
We'll find our own way back

I can't deny what I believe
I can't be what I'm not
I'll know our love forever
I know no matter what

If only tears were laughter
If only night was day
If only prayers were answered
Then we would hear god say

No matter what they tell you
No matter what they do
No matter what they teach you
What you believe is true

And I will keep you safe and strong
And sheltered from the storm
No matter where it's barren
A dream is being born

No matter who they follow
No matter where they lead
No matter how they judge us
I'll be everyone you need

No matter if the sun don't shine
(the sun don't shine)
Or if the skies are blue
(skies are blue)
No matter what the ending
My life began with you

I can't deny what I believe
(what I believe)
I can't be what I'm not
(I know I know)
I know this love's forever
That's all that matters now, no matter what

No no matter what..

No no matter what..
(no no matter that's all that matters to me)
