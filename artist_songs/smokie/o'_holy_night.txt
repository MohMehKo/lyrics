O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth

Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth

The thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Hear the angels voices
Night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night, O Holy night
O night divine

The thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Hear the angels voices
Night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night, O Holy night
O night divine
