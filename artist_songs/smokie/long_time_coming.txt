Didn't want it baby
Never going crazy
I'm a worried mind.

Never waiting for it
I just adore it
Would you be so kind.

It's been a long time coming
A long time coming.

I'm anticipatin'
Feeling that it's creatin'
I must be next in line.

It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
Long time coming.

I know it's a nasty habit
The way I always grab it
But I want this all so bad.

So going do to me 
No one else will do me
It's the best I've ever had.

It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time, yeah.
