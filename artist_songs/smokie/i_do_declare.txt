I started walkin’ Sunday and by Monday
I was headin’ out along that freeway line
'Round about a quarter to nine
I saw a Caddy headin’ north

And I was getting’ tired of walkin’
So I pulled him over to the side
"Say man can you tell me where I can find
Just a little peace of mind
I’m getting’ tired of city livin’
And the orders I’ve been given
And the way I see it is, I could be runnin’ out of time"

He said, "Man, I’ve got just the place
Where you and freedom come face to face
I know just how you feel, this place is unreal
You won’t believe it when you see it
Man, it’s far out of space"

I do declare, I want to take you there
I declare, I want to take you where
Where the people live without it
Don’t concern themselves about it
'Cos they know, they’ve got a reason
And they ain’t about to leave it

I declare, I want to take you there
I do declare, I want to take you where
Where the honeysuckle’s climbin’
And there ain’t no sense of timin’
And you’ll never need remindin’
Why you left and why you came out here

Clare, it was just an hour's drive away
Now listen close to everything I say
We passed through the city limits
And Clare, what lay within it
Was enough to blow your mind away

So come on, Clare, get the hell out of there
They’ll shut you up and make you tear out your hair
So don’t you tell me, maybe ’cos you’re tryin’ to be a lady
They've got everything we ever dreamed
We’d ever want to share

I do declare, I want to take you there
Clare, I want to take you where
Where the people live without it
Don’t concern themselves about it
‘Cos they know, they’ve got a reason
And they ain’t about to leave it

Clare, I want to take you there
I do declare, I want to take you where
Where the honeysuckle’s climbin’
And there ain’t no sense in timin’
And you’ll never need remindin’
Why you left and why you came out here

I do declare, I want to take you there
I declare, I want to take you there
Clare, I wanna love ya, Clare, I wanna make ya
Clare, I want to take you there

I do declare, I want to take you there
I declare, I want to take you there
Clare, I wanna love ya, Clare, I wanna make ya
Clare, I want to take you there

I do declare, I want to take you there
I declare, I want to take you there
Clare, I wanna
