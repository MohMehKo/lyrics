Sadness has gone from the light in my eyes,
Will she be waiting.
Should I feel proud of the tears that I cried,
No hesitating.

Happiness sounds like the one I have lost,
Only to follow.
Where in the world is the one that I've crossed,
Gone is tomorrow.

[Chorus:]
Light in my eyes,
Light up my face,
Light up my life, light up my life,
Light up my life, light up my life.

Feelings of fear all around someone's here,
Look all around me.
Could it be she rediscovering me,
Or did she see.

[Chorus, solo, chorus]
