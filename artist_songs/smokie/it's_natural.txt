It would suit me, if I could be
Sat in the sand, looking at the sun
It's a real treat, sit in the heat,
It can be neat, having lots of fun
I like to lie in the heat of the sun
It's a whole lot of fun and it's natural
I like to laze in the heat of the rays
It's not just a craze, 'cause it's natural
If I stay there, though my skin's fair
Maybe I can get a lovely tan
If you agree, share it with me
Down by the sea, it's a lovely plan
I like to lie in the heat of the sun...
As I wandered through the land of Christmas trees
I ate some doughy bread and rubber cheese
Without my coat and hat I'd surely freeze
And I dream about the land across the see
I like to lie in the heat of the sun---
