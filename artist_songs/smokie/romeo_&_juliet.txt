I don't want to see you down again
I don't want to hear you crying
We're living in different worlds
I can't stand to watch you go and just walk away
Pressured by what people say
I want you and how
My love is for you
And that's all that I need to know

Juliet...
Oh Romeo, Oh Juliet
I need you so, my love won't wait
Together forever, we'll seal our own fate

Our love is a secret of the night
It pains me to use this disguise
We'll meet on the other side
I can't stand to live without your love for a day
We'll meet in the heavens, I pray
Keep holding me now
our love is true
And that's all that we need to know

Juliet...
Oh Romeo, Oh Juliet
I need you so, my love won't wait
Together forever, in Heaven we'll seal our own fate

Oh Romeo, Oh Juliet
Oh Romeo, Oh Juliet
I need you so, my love won't wait
Together forever, we'll seal our own fate

I don't want to see you down again
I don't want to hear you cryin'
We're living in different worlds
I can't stand to watch you go and just walk away
We'll meet in the heavens, I pray
