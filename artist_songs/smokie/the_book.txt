I never knew where it all went wrong
Looking back it always seems so strong
Nothing venture, there was nothing gain
I write a book but remain the name

Fiction causes such a mighty pain
Start to write when you're on the strain
Why it happens only heaven knows
Read my book on how the story goes

There's a love in the middle of this open book
Love in the middle if you take another look
So much to say through the pages
Read on, you will read for ages

Not just the book about the cover
One glance then you're looking through another
First edition hard of the press
Write this book it ends with happiness

There's a love in the middle of this open book
Love in the middle if you take another look
So much to say through the pages
Read on, you will read for ages

Read by many, ready for use
Story is good, guess it's headline news
The best seller, straight from the heart
Cover the cover from the end to the start

There's a love in the middle of this open book
Love in the middle if you take another look
So much to say through the pages
Read on, you will read for ages

Hang on to every word
That I write for you
This is something inside of me
Word for word it's all about you

There's a love in the middle of this open book
Love in the middle if you take another look
So much to say through the pages
Read on, you will read for ages
