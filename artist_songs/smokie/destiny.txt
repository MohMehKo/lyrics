Destiny, has got no reason to see
What fantasy has taken it's hold on me
I feel so lost in this cynical world
Now I find the that I don't have my girl.

We had a row, it was a big mistake
Didn't plan to go and throw my life away
You said you didn't want to make me cry
But I'll keep those tears until the day I die.

You know it's true
I still want you.

Destiny, why don't you save me
Destiny, don't want to be free
Destiny, won't you believe me
Destiny.

When you said you had no more to say
Just broke me up and threw my heart away
You could've told me with a better lie
It really got me going when you said goodbye.

You don't understand it
I wanna stay your man.

Destiny, why don't you save me
Destiny, don't want to be free
Destiny, won't you believe me
Destiny.

I feel so lost in this cynical world
Now I find that I don't have my girl.
You know it's true
I still want you.

Destiny, why don't you save me
Destiny, don't want to be free
Destiny, won't you believe me
Destiny.

You know it's true
I still want you.

Destiny, why don't you save me
Destiny, don't want to be free
Destiny, won't you believe me
Destiny.
