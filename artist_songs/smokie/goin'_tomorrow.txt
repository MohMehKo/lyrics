Goin' tomorrow, goin' away
Goin' tomorrow
Hear me say, I'm goin' away

Goin' tomorrow, leave the past
Goin' tomorrow
And at last I'll leave the past

I've had enough of this here town, yeah
It's breakin' me up, bringin' me down, yeah

Goin' tomorrow, goin' away
Goin' tomorrow
Hear me say, I'm goin' away

I've had enough of this here town, yeah
It's breakin' me up, it's bringin' me down, yeah

Goin' tomorrow, leave the past
Goin' tomorrow
And at last I'll leave the past
And at last I'll leave the past

Hey, hey, hey, I'm goin' away
Hey, hey, hey, I'm goin' away
