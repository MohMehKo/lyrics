O' little town of Bethlehem
Still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
Silent stars go by.

Yet in the dark streets shining
Everlasting light
The hopes, the fears, all the years
Are met in thee tonight.

O' little town of Bethlehem
Still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
Silent stars go by.

Yet in the dark streets shining
Everlasting light
The hopes, the fears, all the years
Are met in the tonight.

How silently, how silently
A wonderous gift is given
And God imparts to human hearts
A blessing of His heaven.

No ear may hear His coming
In this world of sin
Where week souls will receive Him still
The dear Christ enters in.

Yet in the dark streets shining
Everlasting light
The hopes, the fears, all the years
Are met in thee tonight.
