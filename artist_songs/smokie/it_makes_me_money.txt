I hear you didn't like my show
Well that's alright
A critic's views are not all you know
well that's alright

It makes me money
It makes me money
It makes me money
And that's alright

your paper and your pen's so lethal
but that's alright
you really can influence people
well that's alright

It makes me money....

You think you're big time Mr. Man
well tell me something if you can
Why don't you make me a star
Then I'll remember just who you are, sav
Wish I could hear you say
well he's alright
He's a star and he's here to stay
Well that's alright

It makes me money...

It makes me money,
(So you don't like my show)
It makes me money
(Well that's too bad you know)
It makes me money
(It makes me money)
and that's alright
and that's alright
