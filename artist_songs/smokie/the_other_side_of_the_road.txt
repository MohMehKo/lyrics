Getting so sick of your silly lies,
I may have been dumb, but I'm getting wise
You really head me running babe
There was a time you'd looked at me and hypnotize

Feel hung up and you bring me down
Gets to deep and I start to frown
You know what, you're not so hot
'Cause baby I've been trough it
And you only do the things you do
To prove that you can do it

Oh, set me free, I got to see
The other side of the road
Oh, let me go, I got to know
The other side of the road
The other side of the road

Burning up and I don't know why
Got to cut loose and I got to try
I can't stay with you forever
Got a lot of things to do before I die

Getting so tired of the state I'm in
Need a new life, let it all begin
I've had all I can take of you
I'm sick of your deceiving
And it doesn't matter what you do
'Cause baby I'm still leaving

Oh, set me free, I got to see
The other side of the road
Oh, let me go, I got to know
The other side of the road
The other side of the road
