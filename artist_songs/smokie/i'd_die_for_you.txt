You look so sad in your eyes
We now have to pay our price
Cause you are running around
with another guy
You must decide where you stand
And you know I must ask you again and again
Tell me that your love is still the same
I'd die for you my baby
I' die for you my baby
I cry for you when you are not by my side
I had a dream last night
You were not here by my side
and we were fighting against each other
I feel the pain in my heart
Don't you know you are
playing the part again and again
Tell me that your love is still the same
I'd die for you my baby...
