I've been everywhere
Done everything
It's true
I've been everywhere
I've been everywhere
So many things to do
I've been everywhere
I've seen many a marvel in many a town
A mystical moose on a merry go round
I may have been up but I know I've been down
And the melody goes on and on and on
I've met lyrical lions all over the land
Living a life which was ever so grand
Now that is a logic I don't understand
But the melody goes on and on and on
