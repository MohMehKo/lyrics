I've fooled around
I didn't know which road to choose
I let you down
You were feeling so confused
But I want you to know
That my love has grown
And my feelings are all for you
You know girl

My heart is true
You know I really love you
My heart is true
Oh girl I really do
My heart is true
My heart is all for you
My heart is true
And I love you

Playing the game
Thought I had you anytime
Oh you turned the cards
I could see the warning sign
From this heart of stone
A brand new love has grown
I want all the world to know
To know that

My heart is true
You know I really love you
My heart is true
Oh girl I really do
My heart is true
My heart is all for you
My heart is true
And I love you

Looking for a second chance
This could be a great romance

From this heart of stone
A brand new love has grown
I want all the world to know
To know that

My heart is true
You know I really love you
My heart is true
Oh girl I really do
My heart is true
My heart is all for you
My heart is true
And I love you
My heart is true
And I love you
My heart is true
And I love you
My heart is true
And I love you
My heart is true
And I love you
