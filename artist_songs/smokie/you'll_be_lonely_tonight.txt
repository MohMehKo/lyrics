You never seem to notice me
You never seem to like the things I do
So why don't you just let it be
I just cant take the sympathy from you
You always keep me hanging on
You put me down
You always say you don't want me hanging round you
Cant you see that I don't know just what it is that I'm supposed to do
The way you always laugh at me
You know you never really seem to care
You always seem to disagree
You never seem to notice that I'm there
You lead me on and lead me on and push me back
You know no matter what you do I'll still come back to you
Cant you see that I don't know just what it is that I'm supposed to do
You'll be lonely tonight
And then maybe you'll see
When you turn out the light
Could it be that you might just be thinking of me
You'll be needing me then
Want me back again
You'll be lonely tonight
You'll be lonely tonight
I stood around between the lines of happy times I thought of me and you
Cause in your eyes you criticise you hide behind a thin disguise
Put up with so many lies, sympathy and analyse
You never seem to notice me you never seem to like the things I do
So why don't you just let it be
I just cant take the sympathy from you
You always keep me hanging on
You put me down
You always say you don't want me hanging round you
Cant you see that I don't know just what it is that I'm supposed to do
You'll be lonely tonight...
You'll be lonely tonight
You'll be lonely tonight
