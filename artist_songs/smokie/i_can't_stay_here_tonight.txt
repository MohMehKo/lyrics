Open up your tired eyes
And force yourself to smile
Yesterday was yesterday
It's gone, it's tomorrow now
It's here, it's tomorrow now
Now I must go
But I'll see you again

When? oh when?
Please don't ask me when
I'll call, I'll write
But I can not stay here tonight
No, I can not stay here tonight
I can't stay here tonight

Light me up a cigarette
And check that my bags are packed
Something I was gonna say
It's gone - till another time
But how long till that other time
I hate to go
But I'll be back again

When? oh when?
Please don't ask me when
I'll call, I'll write
But I can not stay here tonight
No, I can not stay here tonight
I can't stay here tonight

Open up your tired eyes
And force yourself to smile
Yesterday was yesterday
It's gone, it's tomorrow now
It's here, it's tomorrow now
Now I must go
But I'll be back again

When? oh when?
Please don't ask me when
I'll call, I'll write
But I can not stay here tonight
No, I can not stay here tonight
I can't stay here tonight
