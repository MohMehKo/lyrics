I thought my chance of being in love
Had passed me by, it’s true
But you brought the sun back into my life
Now I must confess to you.

I was the lonely boy
Until you came along and brought me joy
Just like a baby with a brand new toy
You really made my day.

I was a lonely boy
Just a little shy and oh, so coy
With all the charm and grace
That you employ
You stole my heart away.

I was only young and so were you
But what else could I do
One, two, how I love you.

Oh, big fat momma,
Hold me close and squeeze me tight
Bet your bottom dollar, I’ll be right
If I stay with you
Big fat momma, take a walk with me tonight
Bet your bottom dollar, by the light
Of the silvery moon.

Harmonise and croon a simple tune
Together we will spoon
And in june, honey-moon.

Oh, big fat momma,
Hold me close and squeeze me tight
Bet your bottom dollar, I’ll be right
If I stay with you
Big fat momma, take a walk with me tonight
Bet your bottom dollar, by the light
Of the silvery moon.
