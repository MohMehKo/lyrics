You walked into the party like you were walking onto a yacht

You had one eye on the mirror as you watched yourself gavotte
And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner

You're so vain, I'll bet you think this song is about you

To see the total eclipse of the sun

And when you're not you're with
Some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
Wife of a close friend, and...
