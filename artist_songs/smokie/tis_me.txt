Walked out the door, wasn't sure,
Why everyone should stop and stare at me,

Hello there mate, you look great,
Was it really you I saw on the TV?

Hard to believe it's the eve,
Of the most important show of all my life,

Seems insane, see my name,
Lighting up the theatre hall,
I used to go when I small,
Now I'm up there after all.

'Tis me (Why's that name in lights up there, why should people stop and stare?)
