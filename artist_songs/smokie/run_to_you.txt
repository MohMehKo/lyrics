Words are all I have to say to you
They don't come easy when you want them to, my friend
Sitting here while I'm all alone
Never thought that it feels so wrong and then

You went away
Never to say
You'll be back again
It didn't show
That you hated me so
Now my life is at an end
'Cause without you my friend
I don't know

Oh, indeed it was the very first thought
When I felt the ice had melt away
For a time I find that I was blind
And I won't find an other day

While you're in the past
And how I'd last
Didn't know I'd feel
To think of you now
It's easy somehow
Oh, I'd still like to say
I'll be here any day
If you want me

Still I want you in my mind, you know
I find it hard to come to the word, I blow it than
Second thoughts I leave you now
Ain't gonna run to you again

Run to you again
Run to you again
