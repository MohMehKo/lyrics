Oh, Oh, oh, love is all around you
But you're just too blind to see
Where the question of your love lies
Oh, there an answer waits for me
Is it more important that you keep me hanging on
You might wake up one morning
And you'll find,that I'll be gone
Love, is all I want from you, why don't you give to me your
Love is all I want from you, why don't you give to me your
Give it to me, give it to me, baby I need your loving
Give it to me, give it to me, baby I want your loving
Loving and affections is all that I need
Does your conscience ever worry you
'Cause your mind it worries me
So if you get that feeling, be sure to let me know
But baby make it soon, or I'll be gone before you know
Love, is all I want from you, why don't you give to me your...
I need your loving, I need your loving, I need your loving
Your sweet sweet loving
Give it to me, give it to me
And if you give it to me, I'll give the whole world unto you
