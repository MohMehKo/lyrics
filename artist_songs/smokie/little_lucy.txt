You're wasting my time
You're drinking my wine
So Little lucy say goodbye
I've stood quite enough
I'm calling your bluff
The cost of loving's much too hight
So little Lucy, Little Lucy don't you cry
Little Lucy, Little Lucy don't you cry
We've had a hard time honey, so Little Lucy say goodbye
I'm playing it cool
I ain't such a fool
You know our love's just one big lie
We put on a sho, but now you must go
And we can't say we didn't try
So little Lucy, Little Lucy don't you cry
We've had some trouble
Ain't gonna see your face no more
Now at the double
I'm gonna see ya just go right through that door
You're wasting my time,
You're drinking my wine
So Little Lucy say goodbye
I've stood quite enough
I'm calling your bluff
The cost of lobing's much too high
So little Lucy, Little Lucy don't you cry

So little Lucy, Little Lucy don't you cry
