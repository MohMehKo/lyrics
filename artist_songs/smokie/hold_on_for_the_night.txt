Hold on as love takes you through the night
Hold on for the night

You can see along the beach for miles
Where the waves kiss the sand
Walking the beach there were two young souls
Bare foot, hand in hand
And all the dreams they had for each other
Were burning in their hearts
Tonight they find true love
Tonight a fire starts

As they long to each other's passion
A brand new love gave birth
A fire so hot was burning within
Like nothing else on earth
And all the hopes they had for each other
Were buried in their minds
Tonight a new desire
Tonight for loving kind

Hold on as love takes you through the night
Hold on for the night, baby
Hold on for the love that burns so bright
Hold on for the night

You could see the spangle heaven above
As the stars lit the sky
You could hear the distance sound from the shore
As the waves caress the night
And all those dreams, those dreams for each other
Were buried in their minds
Tonight a new desire
Tonight for loving kind

Hold on as love takes you through the night
Hold on for the night, darling
Hold on for the love that burns so bright
Hold on for the night, baby
Hold on as love takes you through the night
Hold on for the night
