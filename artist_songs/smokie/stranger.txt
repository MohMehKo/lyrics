When the night has fallen
And the moon is high
And you get that far away look in your eyes
Oh can't you see you're acting like a stranger
When your loving feelings are so hard to find
And you can deceive me with your made-up lines
Lord knows you sound just like a stranger

So just in case you've changed your mind
You've got love if you want it and it can't go wrong
And just in case you find the time
You've got love if you need it and it can't go wrong

But stranger you're in danger
Of losing me
Oh stranger you're in danger
Of losing me

When the wind is howling and the rain comes down
And you lie awake without a sound
Feel like I'm living with a stranger
When I try to hold you and you turn away
There seems so little left for me to say
Oh Lord knows you look just like a stranger

So just in case you've changed your mind
You've got love if you want it and it can't go wrong
And just in case you find the time
You've got love if you need it and it can't go wrong
But stranger you're in danger
Of losing me
Oh stranger you're in danger
Of losing me
Oh stranger you're in danger
Of losing me
Oh stranger you're in danger
Of losing me
