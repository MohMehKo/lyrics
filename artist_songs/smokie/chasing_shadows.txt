Tried to carry by myself
this heart of mine don't want no one else
My tears of emptiness
Cry out for you caress
I just can't hide this feeling inside of me
- so now I'm
Chasing shadows in the moonlight
Yes, I'm flying high across the sky
- you know I'm
Chasing shadows in the moonlight
Just to be with you tonight
Silent thougths that run through my mind
Keeps the magic burning inside
Still endless days grow cold
Without your love I'm sold
this secret feeling's still burning inside of me
Chasing shadows in the moonlight...
