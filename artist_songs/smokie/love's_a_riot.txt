Jimmy was shaking, it was Saturday night
Love was never meant to give you a fright
It's just a little game you should have been playing
Now spaced out Suzi never known how to refuse
She gets it easy but Jimmy's got the blues
Take over baby, show 'em a thing or two

So they all got together and they gave it a try
'Cause Jimmy was bashful and Jimmy was shy
But you can guess it didn't take him long to catch on
Suzi was impressed and Jimmy was gone

They said

Hey baby, love's a riot
I don't know why it took me so long to try it
Hey baby, love's a riot now

Hey baby, I'm so exited
I don't know why it took me so long to find it
Hey baby, love's a riot now

Now you, you see what happens when you ain't even looking
You turn around and something starts cooking
Hey, look out baby, too late love's got you beat
Now Jimmy and Suzi they've got something else going
They did it all without anybody knowing
Pretty soon you'll hear the tapping of little feet

Now you can bet they never need nobody around
They keep on loving till the sun goes down
Now that they can get together every night
Jimmy's not bashful and Suzi's out of sight

They said

Hey baby, love's a riot
I don't know why it took me so long to try it
Hey baby, love's a riot now

Hey baby, I'm so exited
I don't know why it took me so long to find it
Hey baby, love's a riot now

Hey baby, love's a riot
I don't know why it took me so long to try it
Hey baby, love's a riot now

Hey baby, I'm so exited
I don't know why it took me so long to find it
Hey baby, love's a riot now
Hey baby, love's a riot now
Hey baby, love's a riot now
Hey baby, love's a riot now
Hey baby, love's a riot now

Hey baby, love's a riot
I don't know why it took me so long to try it
Hey baby, love's a riot now
Hey baby, love's a riot now
Hey baby, love's a riot now
