I saw her one morning in the warm morning light
She looked as sweet as could be
Something inside me said she was the one
Who would be marrying me

But it's talking her round to seeing my way
Trying to convince her but it's taking all day
Thinking about what she might do and say
Hoping to God that she sees it my way

I asked her her name and she said it was joy
Asked her if she'd like some joy with this boy
She said that she might try it out just for fun
I think I've convinced her now the fun has begun

But it's talking her round to seeing my way
Trying to convince her but it's taking all day
Thinking about what she might do and say
Hoping to God that she sees it my way

Oh, when I see her walk by me it brings warmth to my body
To touch her brings life to my soul
And when she's in the room I can't see anybody
I'll love her till we both grow old

It's funny how love strikes and still you don't know
If it's right, if it's wrong, if it's fast, if it's slow
But one thing's for sure she's the best piece I've seen
I know when she's coming I know where she's been

But it's talking her round to seeing my way
Trying to convince her but it's taking all day
Thinking about what she might do and say
Hoping to God that she sees it my way

Talking her round to seeing my way
Trying to convince her but it's taking all day
Thinking about what she might do and say
Hoping to God that she sees it my way
