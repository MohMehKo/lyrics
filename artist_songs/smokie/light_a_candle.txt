It's here again
It's that time of year
We're so far apart
That it's breaking my heart
Just to know you won't be here
But I won't cry
I didn't ask why

So just light a candle for me
On New Years Eve
All on my own
You're so far away
A year further on
And the feeling's still strong
How I wish you'd wanted to stay
But I'd be strong
Cause it won't be long
So just light a candle for me
On Christmas Eve

And when the bells are ringing
And Christmas is bringing
A magic that fills the air
You'll be a wonderful sight
On a cold christmas night
And I know
I'll be there
With you, with you
Christmas with you

Thinking of you
As I walk through the snow
I remember your kiss
And just how much I miss
Your smile, I won't let go
But I'll be strong
No, it won't be long
So just light a candle for me
On New Years Eve

And when the bells are ringing
And Christmas is bringing
A magic that fills the air
You'll be a wonderful sight
On a cold christmas night
And I know
I'll be there
With you, with you
Christmas with you

But I'll be strong
It won't be long
So just light a candle for me
On Christmas Eve

And when the bells are ringing
And Christmas is bringing
A magic that fills the air
You'll be a wonderful sight
On a cold christmas night
And I know
I'll be there
With you, with you
Christmas with you
With You
