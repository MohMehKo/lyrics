I brought you flowers, you sold me a line
Exchanging compliments with to much wine
I've played that game, I know all the rules.

You show emotion but you hide what you feel
You're playing the innocence but I watched you steel
I rest my case, you stand accused.

But I must confess, I was quite impressed
You seduced me with your easy charms
And I must admit I could fall for it.

But if love is out of the question
There's no point to this affection
'Cause if love is out of the question
Put a little heart in your attention
I got to have more than ecstasy
Make me believe, I'm all you ever need, babe.

If love is out of the question
Love is out of the question.

You're talking circles when I need a straight line
You've got your principals and I've got mine
Only commitment is all I ask
Is that a crime?

And I must confess, I was quite impressed
I was loosing to your winnin' ways
And I must resist there's no point to this.

But if love is out of the question
There's no point to this affection
'Cause if love is out of the question
Put a little heart in your attention
I got to have more than ecstasy
Make me believe, I'm all you ever need, babe.

'Cause if love is out of the question
I just got to stop
No point to this affection
I just want to stop
It makes no sense to carry on like this
If there's nothing between us
You don't know what you miss.

Love is out of the question
Love is out of the question.
