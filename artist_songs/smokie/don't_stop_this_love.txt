I've heard some people say
Good love is hard to find
Ad then you came my way
You set my heart on fire
I hold inside a burning flame
It burns for you
I've seen it all before, this time I know it's true
Don't stop this love we started
We'd end up broken hearted
I never felt this way girl
Can't find the words to say girl
Don't stop this way we're feeling
Good love that we believe in
You send my whole reelin
I won't stop my lovin for you
Not fear of losing you
No empty hearts in sight
We'll never fool around
Or hurt each other's pride
For you my arms are open wide
Come inside
Two hearts that beat as one
True love to count upon
Don't stop this love we started...
