This night won't last too long
This brain won't call forever
This heart won't turn to stone if we just hold on
When the tears start to fall, we can face it all
If we remember: We can move, we can move

We can move mountains, we are strong together
We can take what's wrong and make it better
A little faith is all we need, just we'll need
We're moving mountains, moving mountains
We're moving mountains, moving mountains

I know we're half way there
I feel the worst is over
And though we just begun, there's a place in the sun
Where love can survive, I'll be by your side
I'll be your shelter:
We can move, we can move

We can move mountains, we are strong together
We can take what's wrong and make it better
A little faith is all we need, just we'll need
We're moving mountains, moving mountains
We're moving mountains, moving mountains

When the tears start to fall, we can face it all
If we remember: We can move, we can move

We can move mountains, we are strong together
We can take what's wrong and make it better
A little faith is all we need, just we'll need
We're moving mountains, moving mountains
We're moving mountains, moving mountains
