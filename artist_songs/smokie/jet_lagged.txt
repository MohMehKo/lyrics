Jet lagged, whipped out
Photographed, want to shout
Criticised, a model life
See me shaped before your eyes
Look at me mamma
Can you sense the situation
It's getting hard to work it out 
All I need is a little moderation.

Jet legged, let it out
Don't know what's it all about
Patronized, adolized
It's getting harder to improvise
Look at me mamma
Can you sense the situation
Sitting on a roundaboud
And surching for a piece of inspiration.

Well sitting in the backroom
Waiting for a doll to come
Hmm, if there's a population waiting
I see you in the county hall
But I ain't even got the time 
To telephone a friend of mine
For usefull information
And help my situation
I get the feeling that they're telling me a lie.

Look at me mamma
Look at me mamma
Look at me mamma...

Sneaking out the backdoor
Wandering which way to go
Standing on the side line
Just waiting for a man to show
But I ain't even got the time 
To telephone a friend of mine
For usefull information
And help my situation
I get the feeling that they're telling me a lie.
