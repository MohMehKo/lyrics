When my hair is turning grey
And my mind has gone astray
Will you think about today
and will you love me
when I'm tired of being told
that I am looking old
will me feeling all turn cold
Or will you love me

Will you love me, love me, hold me
love me,
will you love me when I get old
Will you love me

when I'm feeling full of grief
'Cos I'm losing all my teeth
And there's nothing underneath
will you love me
when my days are getting few
We can't do things that we now do
No more prize that you once knew
Will you love me

Will you love me,...

and when I'm dead and gone
If you're still living on
Will you think about this song
And will you love me

Will you love me,...
