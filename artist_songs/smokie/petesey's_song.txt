Monday morning was a V.I.P.
Tuesday night they didn't wanna know me,
Wednesday night drank sour grapes,
Must'a smoked near on fifty straights a-huh-huh.

Friday wondered where Thursday went,
Saturday failed to pay my rent,
Sunday found me in the church to say,
If you got a little heaven won't you send it my way.

[Chorus:]
Remember me, I'm Petesey,
Feeling like sixty, more like thirty-five,
Remember me, I'm Petesey,
Feeling like sixty, more like thirty-five,
Remember me.

Took a trip way across the sea,
Right through Holland and Germany,
Played the tourist at Frankfurt Zoo,
The monkeys said "Who the hell are you?"
(Who the hell are you).

[Chorus]

I was sailing along yes I was singing my song,
Yes I was singing my song to you,
He was sailing along yes he was singing his song,
Yes he was singing his song to you,
Remember me.

Well I wouldn't say that I was overproud,
But it seems to me I've gotta shout out loud,
No-one ever seems to recognise me,
I think I'll become one of the other three,
(Oh no you won't).

Chorus
