I need you now, I do, I do
Your tears, oh girl, are telling you
But it's all a big mistake
And your hearts about to break in two
But a miracle will come
And the pain will be undone, very soon.

Stars will glow in the dark
Moonbeams they mend broken hearts
In the shadows of the night
Looking forward to the light from the sun
You will find yourself again
And you'll always have a friend, so don't frown.

Your time will come
See how they run
Ooh, ooh, Mariah
Ooh, ooh, Mariah.

Look to the sky and see the moon
I want to go and so do you
I will be there in your mind
Ooh, ooh, Mariah
Ooh, ooh, Mariah.

Ooh, ooh, Mariah
Ooh, ooh, Mariah
Ooh, ooh, Mariah
Ooh, ooh, Mariah.
