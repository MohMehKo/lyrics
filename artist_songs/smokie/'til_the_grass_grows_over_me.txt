Words don't come easy to a man like me
But I'll do the best I can to tell you how I feel
You're a part of me, the heart of me
There's no place I would rather be
Than holding on eternally to you

How lucky can one man ever be?
I'll love you 'til the grass grows over me

I know one thing for certain there's no doubt in my mind
The first time we made love, that's when I came alive
You're so right for me, you'll always be the only one I'll ever need
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you

How lucky can one man ever be?
I'll love you 'til the grass grows over me

And if life throws us a curve ball and brings us to our knees
Together we'll still make it through, as long as you're with me

How lucky can one man ever be?
I'll love you 'til the grass grows over me
Over me
