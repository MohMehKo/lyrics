Through the shadows of the night
I hear your lonely voice calling
Echo's from a distant land
So near yet so far away
with the sunset in your eyes
A darkness came without warning
ahh, you took me by surprise
and left me falling like rain
whenever I need love, I close my eyes
whenever I see love, I look to the skies
Don't go steppin' on seashells,
you'll only get hurt
Don't go steppin' on seashells,
there's a lesson to learn
Don't go steppin' on seashells
Don't go steppin' on seashells
Steppin' on seashells
Steppin' softly through the years
Feeling empty and cold
Lost behind a sea of tears
Burns a heartfull of gold
Whenever I need love, i close my eyes
whenever I see love, I look to the skies
Don't go steppin' on seashells,..
whenever I need love, I close my eyes
Whenever I see love, I look to the skies
Don't go steppin' on seashells,...
