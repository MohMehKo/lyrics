Samantha Elizabeth, you're on my mind
Samantha Elizabeth, all of the time
You keep me dreaming
Only of you
And oh, I'm stuck on you
I'm stuck on you
Oh

Samantha Elizabeth, the questions you ask
Samantha Elizabeth, you're growing up fast

You are my everything
My heart, my home
You taught me everything
I've ever known
