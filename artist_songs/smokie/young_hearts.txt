Oh
Take my love
Fly with me the universe

Search your soul
Baby
Make your feelings hurt.
Oh
Tears of love are souveniers from paradise

You stole my heart
See the tears in my eyes.
Touch my heart
Baby
My dreams come true

You are the only one
Baby
What can I do?

Young hearts
Feeling stronger every day

They are playing to win
Girl

Young hearts
Jeaven's just a sin away
Oh
It isn't too late
Girl.
If love is just a silly game I don't wanna play this game no more
And if your love will lose the flame
I never felt like this before.

Oh
I will be there if you ever want me
Girl

Take your chance
Meet me in another world.
A town called love
Baby
Is just a breath away

Take my hand
Baby
Come and make my day.
Touch my heart
Baby
My dreams come true

You are the only one
Baby
What can I do?

Young hearts
Feeling stronger every day

They are playing to win
Girl

Young hearts
Heaven's just a sin away
Oh
It isn't too late
Girl.
If love is just a silly game I don't wanna play this game no more
And if your love will lose the flame
I never felt like this before.

Young hearts
Feeling stronger every day

They are playing to win
Girl

Young hearts
Heaven's just a sin away
Oh
It isn't too late
girl.
If love is just a silly game I don't wanna play this game no more
And if your love will lose the flame
I never felt like this before.

Young hearts
Feeling stronger every day

Just reach out and touch
Girl

Young hearts
Heaven's just a sin away
No way
No way
Darling.
Young hearts
Feeling stronger every day
Nove on closer to me
Girl

Young hearts
Heaven's just a sin away
Don't lose this flame

Don't lose it!
