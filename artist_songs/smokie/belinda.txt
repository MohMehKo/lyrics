If you should see my Belinda
Tell her I miss her so
And give all my love to Belinda
I want her to know

I want her, I need her, I love her
I didn't mean to make you cry Belinda
When I said bye-bye Belinda
Won't you please come on home to me
Can't you see
I was just to blind Belinda
When I said bye-bye Belinda
Please, come on home to me

So if you should see my Belinda
Please tell her I love her so
And keep on telling my Belinda
I want her to know

I want her, I need her, I love her
I didn't mean to make you cry Belinda
When I said bye-bye Belinda
Won't you please come on home to me
Can't you see
I was just to blind Belinda
When I said bye-bye Belinda
Please, come on home to me
