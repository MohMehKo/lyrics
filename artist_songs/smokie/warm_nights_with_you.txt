If I gave up the rest for you
Tell me where would it lead me
Girl if your love is true
Tell me what would you do
Ooh, ooh

If I promise you all my life
Would you ever believe me
And if you think you do
Could it be leading to
Warm nights with you

Warm nights, warm nights
Warm nights with you
Warm nights, warm nights
(Just warm, just warm, just warm, just warm)
Warm nights with you
(Just warm, just warm nights with you)

If you don't put your trust in me
And you think I'd deceive you
Won't you deprofess me
Oh, what a fool I'd be
Want you with me

Warm nights, warm nights
Warm nights with you
Warm nights, warm nights
(Just warm, just warm, just warm, just warm)
Warm nights with you
(Just warm, just warm nights with you)

If I gave up the rest for you
Tell me where would it lead me
Girl if your love is true
Tell me what would you do
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Warm nights, warm nights
Warm nights with you
Warm nights, warm nights
(Just warm, just warm, just warm, just warm)
Warm nights with you
(Just warm, just warm nights with you)
Warm nights, warm nights
(Just warm, just warm, just warm, just warm)
Warm nights with you
(Just warm, just warm nights with you)
Warm nights, warm nights
(Just warm, just warm, just warm, just warm)
Warm nights with you
(Just warm, just warm nights with you)
Warm nights, warm nights
(Just warm, just warm, just warm, just warm)
Warm nights with you
(Just warm, just warm nights with you)
Warm nights, warm nights
(Just warm, just warm, just warm, just warm)
Warm nights with you
(Just warm, just warm nights with you)
