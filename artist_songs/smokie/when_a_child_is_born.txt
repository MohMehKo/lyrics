A ray of hope flickers in the sky
A tiny star lights up way up high
All across the land dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born
A silent wish sails the seven seas
The winds of change whisper in the trees
And the wall of doubt crumbles dust and torn
This comes to pass when the child is born
The rosy view settles all around
You got the feel you're on solid ground
For a spell or two no one seems forlorn
This comes to pass when a child is born
And all this happens because the world is waiting
Waiting for one child
Black, white, yellow
No one knows
This child who will grow up and turn tears to laughter
Hate to love
War to peace
And everyone to everyone's neighbor
And misery and suffering will be words to be forgotten forever
For a spell or two no-one seems forlorn
This comes to pass when a child is born
It's all a dream an illusion now
It must come true sometime soon somehow
And all across the land dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born
This comes to pass when a child is born
This comes to pass when a child is born
This comes to pass when a child is born
