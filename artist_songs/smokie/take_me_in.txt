Don't want no money, don't want no blues
Don't want no money no, all I want is you, Take me in
Don't want your honey now (no honey now)
Don't want your speed (no speed)
Your satisfaction (satisfaction)
Is all I need
Take me in, take me in, take me in,
Take me in, take take, take me in,
I can't wait no longer, the time is now
Can you feel me real warm, let me come inside
Take me in, take me in, take me in
Take me in, take take, take me in
Lovely lover love laying, right next to you
I get a burning sensation, thrills me through and through
Take me in, take me in, take me in, take me in.
Don't want no money, don't want no blues
Don't want no money no, all I want is you
Take me in, Take me in, take me in, take me in,
Take me in, take me in, take me in,
Oh, take me in, Oh woman I gotta come inside
Oh, take me in, hear my cry baby
Oh, gotta make you baby, gotta feel you warm,
Won't you take me in, take me in
