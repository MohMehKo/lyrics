First time I caught your eyes
I saw something in you
A world of warmth and tenderness inside
First time you smiled you smiled
I fell in love with you
Yes I lost my heart to you
On that night
So let's dance one more dance
Before I take you on home
And on the way we'll pull off the road all alone
And we will make love until the breaking of dawn
And I will show you all the love so strong
Come on and dance
Come n let's dance
Celebrate this good romance
Tonight I still see in you
What I saw before
And I know that my feelings are still true
Yes I know nobody else
Who could satisfy me more
Cause no one else makes love
The way you do
So let's dance...
