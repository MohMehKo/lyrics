Where you going when the party's over
And the lights are going dim?
Will you be with the one you love
Or will you be with him?
I can't hold on any longer
To a fading memory
I can't fight any stronger
Do you wanna make a fool of me?

Hot nights can be full of power
Turns your head to another world
City lights with a neon burning
Change you into another girl
I don't wanna lose this magic feeling
To a night that's lost control
Give a thought to what you're meaning
Get a grip, don't lose your soul

This night was never made in heaven
This night was never meant to be
How could I know you had a reason to go

Bright lights in a flashing moment
Blue eyes stare across the floor
Do you wanna leave this boy behind?
If you do then there's the door
I don't wanna lose this magic feeling
To a guy that lost control
Give a thought to what you're leaving
Don't make me feel so cold

This night was never made in heaven
This night was never meant to be
How could I know you had a reason to go

Where you going when the party's over?
