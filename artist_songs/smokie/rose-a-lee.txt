Rose-a-lee, aah Rose-a-lee
take these chains from my heart
and set me free
I was lost, now I'm found
Got my feet back on solid ground
I was lonesome like a fool
I did you wrong I broke the rule
Now I sure do regret
I was so foolish to be lead
Rose-a-lee, ohh rose-a-lee
Why do you hang this shame on me?
Rose-a-lee, ooh Rose-a-lee
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Take me back ohh Rose-a-lee
Oh say that you've forgiven me
'cos I can't take it anymore
Let's go back to the way things used
to be before
Win or lose, I won't give in
Just say you'll take me back again
Rose-a-lee, ohh rose-a-lee...
Now I'm down on my knees
and I'm begging you please
Rose-a-lee, ohh rose-a-lee...
Rose-a-lee, ohh rose-a-lee...
