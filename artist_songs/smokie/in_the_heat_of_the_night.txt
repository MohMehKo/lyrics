In the heat of the night when you know it ain't right
But you do what you want to do
You do what you feel but no one can feel like you

In the summertime city ain't it a pity
There's so much to tie you down
You're leaving tonight for somewhere you can't be found

While down at the end of town
At a pool hall where they all hang around
You can hear them talking 'bout girls they know
Talking 'bout what they're gonna do
Then you ask yourself is this where you belong
