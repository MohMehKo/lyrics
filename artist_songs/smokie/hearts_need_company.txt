I can't stay another night
I can't take it any longer
Win or lose I'll end this fight
Love's not growing any stronger
Oh no.

I lie in the dead of night
But I can't find a reason
Love's cold like a winters sun
Then it changed just like the season
Oh no.

You can't keep running away
Nobody ever made it alone
You can't keep hiding away
Oh no.

Hearts need company
To keep out the cold
Hearts need company
Somebody to hold
Hearts need company
Hearts need company.

If only you could see the light
We could still be there girl
Love on an endless flight
But you decided on your own word.

But you can't keep running away
Nobody ever made it alone
You can't keep hiding away
Oh no

Hearts need company
To keep out the cold
Hearts need company
Somebody to hold
Hearts need company
Hearts need company.

You know you can't keep running away
Nobody ever made it alone
You can't keep hiding away
Oh no
Oh no, no.

Hearts need company
To keep out the cold
Hearts need company
Somebody to hold
Hearts need company
Hearts need company.

Hearts need company
To keep out the cold
Hearts need company
Somebody to hold
Hearts need company
Hearts need company.
