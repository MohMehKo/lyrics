Couldn't live without your body
Couldn't live without your love
All I'm asking is you love me
It's the only thing I'm thinking off

Been together for so long, love
Your loving touch is all I need
Can't take not knowing where I stand, love
You mean the world or more to me

All the guys just stand and stare at you
They long to squeeze and hold you tight
Don't even see me standing there with you
Can't help my feeling it's not right

Now it's time to now the answer
If I've to go or have to stay
And if you're love's enough to keep me here
I'll never go away
