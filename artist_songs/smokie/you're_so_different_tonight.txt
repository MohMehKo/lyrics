Baby, I've never seen you look the way you do
There's something special in your eyes
Maybe I, I should tell you how I feel for you
I want your love to be mine
Cause you're so different tonight
You shine when you walk in the room
You're so different tonight
Seems all the boys have eyes for you
hypnotise I fantasise
Ooh, ooh, ooh ...
tell me you feel it too
No one could look the way you do
Lately I, I've been thinking about you and me
And what the future has in store
Lady, I need to tell you what I really need
I want your love for evermore
Cause you're so different tonight...
Oh baby, I love you
I want you to feel like I do
