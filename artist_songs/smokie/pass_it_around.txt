Well do you know how it feels
To be walkin' around
with your run down heels
and do you know just how it looks
to be left outside with your college books
And the great thing bout being you
Is you can do whatever you want to do

So if you turn on to something good
and by the way you're going
God knows you should
If you turn on to something good
If you turn on to something good
Pass it around

Well do you know what it's like
To be locked inside nearly every night
And do you know how people talk
when you ain't got a car
so you walk, walk, walk
and the great thing about being you
Is you're free to do what you want to do

So if you turn on to something good...

don't keep it to yourself cos I ain't got nothin' else
Don't keep it to yourself cos I need your help

So if you turn on to something good...
