Sunshine Avenue we never knew
Would only be in memory
But how are we to know what time can do
Sunshine Avenue will always be
My Disneyland, Peppers band
Helping hand a larger part of me

Walking on Sundays
Dance in the rain
You and me laughing
Oh, but Sunshine Avenue you and I will never find again

Sunshine Avenue remember when
Used to dream a lovers dream
Oh, how it seems to be so simple then
Sunshine Avenue Iâ€™ve thought of you
You always keep a part of me
Be with me with everything I do

Walking on Sundays
Dance in the rain
You and me laughing
Oh, but Sunshine Avenue you and I will never find again

Sunshine Avenue we never knew
Would only be in memory
But how are we to know what time can do
Sunshine Avenue will always be
My Disneyland, Peppers band
Helping hand a larger part of me

My Disneyland, Peppers band
Helping hand a larger part of me
My Disneyland, Peppers band
Helping hand a larger part of me
Sunshine Avenue you and I will never find again
My Disneyland, Peppers band
Helping hand a larger part of me
Sunshine Avenue you and I will never find again
