A lonely castle on an island
A string of diamonds on a ring of gold
All the fortune that surrounds them
Couldn't take the place of you now
He gave me all he gave me glory
You made a palace grow in my minds eye
Making the darkside of the story
It's simply passing by
All I wanted was for you to stand by me
You gave me everything that I could ever need
Oooo I'm telling you
Your love is so good for me
Your love is so good for me
Your love is so good for me
All I wanted was for you to stand by me
You gave me everything that I could ever need
Your love is so good for me...
I try not to show that I'm missing you so but I am
Your love is so good for me...
Your love is so good for me...
