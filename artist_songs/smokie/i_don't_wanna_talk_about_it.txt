I can tell by your eyes 
That you've probably been crying forever,
And the stars in the sky 
Don't mean nothing to you, they're a mirror

I don't wanna talk about it, 
How you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer,
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart, whoa, heart

If I stand all alone, will the shadow 
Hide the color of my heart
Blue for the tears,
Black for the night 
Where the stars in the sky
Don't mean nothing to you, they're a mirror

I don't wanna talk about it, 
How you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer,
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart, whoa, heart

I don't wanna talk about it, 
How you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer,
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart, whoa, heart.
