You say I'm a dreamer
Hold on
Listen to me
Oh baby I'm a dreamer
Hold on
Hold on please don't go
You know I'm nothing
Without you by my side
Please don't leave me you take me so high
You say that you're leaving
Hold on
Listen to me
You say you've stopped believing
Hold on
Hold on please don't go
The door is open suitcase stands in the hall [?]
Please change your mind now
Before you go through the door
Mirror mirror will you answer me today
Can you tell me what you see
I'm no hero but I love her so
Please let her know
Why should she leave
You know I'm nothing
Without you by my side
Please don't leave me you take me so high
Mirror mirror will you answer me today
Can you tell me what you see
I'm no hero but I love her so
Please let her know
Why should she leave
