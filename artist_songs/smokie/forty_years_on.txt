I remember back when we first started
We were all together chasing all our dreams
Every day we seemed to get much better
Our hopes and disappointments were all part of the scene
We traveled ‘round the world to spread our music
And made more friends and fans each place we played
Success just followed on, it seemed like magic
So thank you all for giving me those days

’75 we really made the breakthrough
We were riding high then with records in the charts
Toys and TV shows and all we wanted
Seemed so many people all took us to their hearts
And everything was new and so exciting
Just one big adventure all the way
We didn’t know our story we were writing
So thank you all for giving me those days

Forty years on, where have they gone
Thinking of days that don’t seem so long
Where are the boys that we were once then
Fortunate friends, now forty years on

Thinking of the times we shared between us
The times we shared together changed all of our lives
Memories that haunt now and forever
And only we remember those heady days and nights
Now we may be older but no wiser
Time has made us go our different ways
We won’t forget who gave us all those chances
So thank you all for giving me those days

Forty years on, where have they gone
Thinking of days that don’t seem so long
Where are the boys that we were once then
Fortunate friends, now forty years on
