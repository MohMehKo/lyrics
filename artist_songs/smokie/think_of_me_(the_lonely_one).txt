Walking down the avenue
Think of things we used to do
Where are you
Oh, it’s not easy anymore, no it’s not easy

Sympathy I try to hide
Than you left, oh, how I cried
Foolish pride
Now it’s not easy anymore, no it’s not easy

Think of me, I’m the lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely one
Used to be, oh, your only, only, only
Only, only, only, only one

How you wanted to be free
I was a fool to disagree
Is it me
Oh, it’s not easy anymore, no it’s not easy

Think of me, I’m the lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely one
Used to be, oh, your only, only, only
Only, only, only, only one

Walking down the avenue
Think of things we used to do
Where are you
Oh, it’s not easy anymore, no it’s not easy

Think of me, I’m the lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely one
Used to be, oh, your only, only, only
Only, only, only, only one
