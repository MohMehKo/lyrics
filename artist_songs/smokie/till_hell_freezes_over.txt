Lately I've seen you crying
I have somebody's tears
lately I ain't been trying
I've been foolish for so many years
Now your suitcase stands in the hallway
All the memories you just can't deny
Till hell freezes over
Till the sun doesn't shine
Till the river stops flowing
Girl you'll be mine
Tell me you're doing fine now
I miss you more than I should
You tell me I should let go now
But I fight it this other love
Now you're leaving
I ain't disappearing
those kisses he gives you
Those kisses are mine
Till hell freezes over...
Till hell freezes over...
When I said that I loved you
I meant for all time
I thirst for the water
It keeps me alive
I can't give up fighting
there's one reason why
Just need you beside me
Without you I'll die
girl you'll be mine
Till hell freezes over...
