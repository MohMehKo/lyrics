You came in just as I was leaving with my denim bag
Everything that I own is sitting in a taxi cab
And my hope like the rain kept falling, the sun is gone I guess
There's no dinner in the oven, no forwarding address

Don't ask me why I'm running
Cause you should have seen this coming

Take a minute just to think about it, baby
Take a minute just to work it out, yeah
I was feel like a stranger in your town
Every evening it's another showdown
It's a circus but I ain't your clown
And I'm tired of fighting
Now I'm riding out

Here's my key and the ring you gave me, you can have them back
I was counting the nights I've been lonely but I lost track

I've spent all this time not knowing
And you wonder why I'm going

Take a minute just to think about it, baby
Take a minute just to work it out, yeah
I was feel like a stranger in your town
Every evening it's another showdown
It's a circus but I ain't your clown
And I'm tired of fighting
Now I'm riding out
I'm riding out, yeah

Don't ask me why I'm running
Cause you should have seen this coming

Take a minute just to think about it baby
Take a minute just to work it out, yeah
Take a minute just to think about it baby
Take a minute just to work it out, yeah

Take a minute
Take a minute, yeah
Take a minute
Take a minute
Think about it
Just work it out
