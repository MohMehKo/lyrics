He's got worn out black boots, there are holes in his jeans
And he's seen better days when he played the big league
For a while he almost made it and he reached for the stars
But love did him wrong and broke his heart

So now he's standing on the corner
Singin' songs about his life
Crazy nights and lonely mornings, good and bad times
Every line tells a story
And he's living with no regrets
Cause what's done is done, you just can't change the past

He got lost for a moment but he found his way out
Just in time before he went down
But he still loves his music and he plays when he can
The whole world is his stage for cash in a can

Now he's standing on the corner
Singin' songs about his life
Crazy nights and lonely mornings, good and bad times
Every line tells a story
And he's living with no regrets
Cause what's done is done, you just can't change the past

Life goes on here all the time
We can choose to live or we can choose to die
Give in or try, crash or fly

Now he's standing on the corner
Singin' songs about his life
Crazy nights and lonely mornings, good and bad times
Every line tells a story
And he's living with no regrets
Cause what's done is done, you just can't change the past
Cause what's done is done, you just can't change the past
What's done is done, you just can't change the past
