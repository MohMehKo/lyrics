I swear I'll answer no charges
Of theft or purgery
When through neglect you lose the one that you love
It's not easy to see
so,
You should have shown some respect
Should have made her feel like
she was something special
You should have shown some respect
What you deserve is what you get
What you deserve is what you get
No use in saying sorry
Not much that you can do now
No use in saying you'll be good to her
She don't think you know how
You should have shown some respect...
