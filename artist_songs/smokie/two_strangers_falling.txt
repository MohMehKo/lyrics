Through the lights on the stage she could see the young trooperdor playing
He was handsome and strong and the music kept drawing her near
When night found them there they were too young to care
Each of them wanting a chance
Two strangers falling, looks like they're caught in romance
She wasn't looking for anything more than flirtation
He was just bored and though she might help pass the time
But the night was alive there was nowhere to hide
Each of them needing a chance...
Young love filled with the fire
Sparked by a passion a flirting desire
Long live to give love a chance
Feels like they're caught in romance
Feels like they're caught in romance
Ohh yeah
Was a quiet night as they strolled through the streets of the city
Talking and laughing the night would too soon become day
But when morning had come they had both been as one
Each of them taking the chance...
Young love filled with the fire
Sparked by a passion a flirting desire
Long live to give love a chance
Feels like they're caught in romance
Feels like they're caught in romance
Feels like they're caught in romance
Feels like they're caught in romance
