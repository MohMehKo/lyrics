Even though you offered, I still refuse
Though your face is pretty, I don't have to choose
Goodbye cardboard city, you've nothing to say
Though your face is pretty, I don't have to say
She's my friend and you know what I like
She's my friend and you know what I like
You know what I like
Going back to Bradford, it's what I prefer
Though your face is pretty, you're nothing like her
She's my friend and you know what I like
She's my friend and you know what I like
you know what I like
Goodbye, moi, moi, nakaimin, see ya again,
Cheerio, gotta go, so long, I'm gone
I'm going back to Bradford, it's what I prefer
though your face is pretty, you're nothing like her
She's my friend and you know what I like
she's my friend and you know what I like
You know what I like
Going back to Bradford, it's what I prefer
though your face is pretty, you're nothing like her
going back to Bradford, it's what I prefer
Going back to Bradford, it's what I prefer
