Silent night, Holy night
All is come, all is bright
Round your virgin, mother and child
Holy infant, so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Silent night, Holy night
Shepherds ways, for the sign
Shinning light that come from a far
Heavenly host, singing Hallelujah
Christ the Savior is born 
Christ the Savior is born.

Silent night, Holy night.

Silent night, Holy night
All is come, all is bright
Round your virgin, mother and child
Holy infant, so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace.
