I can feel a new expression on my face.
I can feel a glowing sensation taking place.
I can hear the guitars play lovely tunes,
Ev-er-ry-time that you - walk in the room.

I close my eyes for a second,
And pretend it's me you want.
Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant.
I see a summer night with a magic moon.
Ev-er-ry-time that you - walk in the room.

Maybe it's a dream come true,
Walkin' right alongside of you.
Wish I could tell you how much I care,
But I only - have the nerve to stare.

I can feel a-something pounding in my brain,
Just anytime that someone speaks your name.
Trumpets sound and I hear thunder boom.
Ev-er-ry-time that you - walk in the room.
Ev-er-ry-time that you - walk in the room.
