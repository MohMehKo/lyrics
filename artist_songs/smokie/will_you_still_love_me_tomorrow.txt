Tonight you're mine completely
you give your love so sweetly
tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow
Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
So tel me now I won't ask again
will you still love me tomorrow
Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
but will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun?
will you still love me tomorrow
tonight with words unspoken
you say that I'm the only one
but will my heart be broken
when the night meets the morning sun?
I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
so tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
will you still love me tomorrow
