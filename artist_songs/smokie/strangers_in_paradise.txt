Well I look to the sky
Reflections of you and I
And as we fly
Strangers in paradise
We're on the outside looking in
And we're on the inside
And fall back again
Magic nights
Strangers in Paradise
Well I look to the sky
Well I look to the sky
Reflections of you and I
And as we fly...
Strangers in Paradise
We're on the outside looking in
We're on the inside
Strangers in paradise
Strangers in paradise
Strangers in paradise
