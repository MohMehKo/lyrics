Well my beating heart exploded with a mighty crash
And my legs were shaking, things were moving way too fast
In the daylight hour I don't remember her name
I know deep inside my life won't be the same
So I'll hold on to her memory

She said life would be simple, love would be so sweet
As I held out my hand to another lonely heartbeat
I know I must find this mysterious girl
My whole life's in turmoil, my heart's in a whirl
So I'll hold on, hold on, hold on to her memory

What you doing this side of Paradise?
Trying to make me pay your price
But you don't know the way I feel
Is this a dream or is it real?

Like a flash of lightning she came down to me
In a blinding moment I found I could see
All her face in its glory, a body so tight
I know I must find I'll look into the night
In a world of adventure the name of the game
It's the one that we live in, no person's the same
So I'll hold on, hold on, hold on to her memory

What you doing this side of Paradise?
Trying to make me pay your price
But you don't know the way I feel
Is this a dream or is it real?

In my mind I'm trying to see her perfect face
But the image has gone just a time another place
In a blinding moment I found I could see
Her face in its glory, it shone down on me
Still I hold on, hold on, hold on to that memory

What you doing this side of Paradise?
Trying to make me pay your price
But you don't know the way I feel
Is this a dream or is it real?
