Daydreamin' is an occupation I know
'Cos I got nothin else to do
Daydreamin' is an occupation I know
I sit alone and think of you

And I don't believe in make believe don't deceive myself
All that I have left of you
Is up here on the shelf

Stargazin' is an occupation I know
I watch them flashing through the sky
I see your face with every twinkle of the night
Can't stop myself from asking why

And I don't believe in make believe...

And I don't believe in make believe...
