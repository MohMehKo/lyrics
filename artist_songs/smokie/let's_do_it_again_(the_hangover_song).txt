I woke up with my head in the sink again
Hanging out all night with my friends
My brain feels like it's caving in
Lager is still the king

If only I could change this head of mine
Ohh what a price to pay for a good old time
One single turned to forty pints
Oh my, oh my

Life is a wonderful thing, don't you know?
You gotta put it on fire, let it go like there's no tomorrow
You gotta chase your dreams, don't let 'em disappear
And tomorrow, my friend, we'll do it all again

When I close my eyes I see your face
I hear your voice and feel your warm embrace
The laughs we had, the plans
Let's go to the south of France

Babe, I hear you knocking on my door
"Come on out, let's do it just once more"
Get up, let's have a ball
What do you say? Come on

Life is a wonderful thing, don't you know?
You gotta put it on fire, let it go like there's no tomorrow
You gotta chase your dreams, don't let 'em disappear
And tomorrow, my friend, we'll do it all over again

Ohhh the banging in my head
Round and round and round and round and...

Life is a wonderful thing, don't you know?
You gotta put it on fire, let it go like there's no tomorrow
You gotta chase your dreams, don't let 'em disappear
And tomorrow, my friend, we'll do it again

Life is a wonderful thing, don't you know?
You gotta put it on fire, let it go like there's no tomorrow
You gotta chase your dreams, don't let 'em disappear
And tomorrow, my friend, we'll do it all again
Just do it
