You; you are my life,
you are my only possession
and I will love you all my life
Years, years ago,
you were my only obsession
and I have loved you all my life
you flew to me like a bird on the wing
When, when I was down
you stayed with me through the bad times
for that I will love you all my life
We can say we are free
we don't need any more,
we don't need any more
Now there is no more,
nothing less than the good times
and I will be with you all my life
Moments of joy with some moments of silence
And I'll give you guidance all my life
We can say we are free
We don't need any more,
We don't need any more
You, you are my life,
you are my only possession
And I will love you all my life
