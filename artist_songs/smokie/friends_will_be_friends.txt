It's been twenty years today and they went by so fast
many strange mistakes were made but who's living in the past?
Cuase there were times when everything just fell apart
We had the fire blazing round our heads and hearts

Friends will be friends
Friends will be friends
We're back to where we started with a heart and soul

Well I don't know where you have been but I kept you here with me
buried in oblivion or drowning in misery
Cause there were times when all we had was our faith
then we got lost and we got crazy and made mistakes

Friends will be friends
Friends will be friends
Back to where we started with a heart and soul

Friends will be friends
Friends will be friends
We're back to where we started with a heart and soul

It's been twenty years today and they went by so fast

Friends will be friends
Friends will be friends
We're back to where we started with a heart and soul

Friends will be friends
Friends will be friends
With a heart and soul
