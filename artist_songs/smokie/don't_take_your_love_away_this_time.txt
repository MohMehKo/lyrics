Don't take your love away
Leave it behind
Maybe another day
You will find
That deep in your heart you've been searching
For something that's here all the time
So, don't take your love away this time.

If you must run to him
Please, make up your mind
I'll try to understand
Though he's not your kind
I promise to make all your dreams come true
Baby, if you'll still be mine
So, don't take your love away this time.

This time, don't tell me that we're through
â€˜cause life can't go on without you.

You know we can't go on pretending
So darling, please give me a sign
And don't take your love away this time.

You know we can't go on pretending
So darling, please give me a sign
And don't take your love away this time.

If you must run to him
Please, make up your mind
I'll try to understand
Though he's not your kind
I promise to make all your dreams come true
Baby, if you'll still be mine
So, don't take your love away this time.

Don't take your love away this time
Don't take your love away this time
Don't take your love away this time.
