I'm on the town in a rock and roll bar
Playing lay down sally on the blues guitar
Playing slide like I've never seen
Hey, she was a rock and roll queen
She was young and wild and free
From that look in her eyes she was covering me
So I took a chance on a dance and a twirl
I said where you from she said Derry girl
Ahhhhhh Derry Girl
Derry girl oh Derry girl
I fell in love with a Derry girl
Derry girl oh Derry girl
I fell in love with a Derry girl
I'm in love with a Derry girl
After the show we took a stroll outside
Exchanging words in the grey moonlight
She seemed a little crazy to me
But that's just part of the rock and roll scene
So young and wild and restless
Still living in a teenage dream
She walked right into my world
Ohhh that little Derry girl
Ohhh Derry ...
She was young and wild and free
From that look in her eye she was covering me
She walked right into my world
Ohhh that little Derry girl
Ohh that Derry girl
Derry girl...
I'm in love with a Derry girl
I fell in love with a Derry girl
