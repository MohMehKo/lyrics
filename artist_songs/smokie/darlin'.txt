Darlin' I'm feelin' pretty lonesome
Call you on the phone some
But I don't have a dime

Darlin' you are so far behind me
Tomorrow's gonna find me
Further down the line

Take me some paper
Pencil in my hand
I'm gonna write darlin'
You know I feel the cold nights
Thinking of the whole nights
Spent alone with you

Darlin' the tear is in my eye now
Knowing I could try now
To make it back to you
Oh yeah

Darlin' I love you more than ever
I wish we were together
Darlin' mine

Darlin' I'm feelin' pretty lonesome
Call you on the phone some
But I don't have a dime

Darlin' I'm feelin' pretty lonesome
Call you on the phone some
But I don't have a dime.
