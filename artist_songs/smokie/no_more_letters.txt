Gotta rubber stamp on my jumbo,
Gotta rubber stamp on my brain,
Gotta rubber stamp on my jumbo,
Hey - got to get, I got to get, I got to get away.

Ain't got no grease on my finger,
Ain't got no dirt on my glove,
Ain't got no grease on my finger,
Hey - got to get, I got to get, I got to get away.

[Chorus:]
Long time you say,
No more letters,
No more letters,
No more letters,
No more letters,
No more letters,
Get away.

Long legged man in the corner,
Watching the time pass away,
Long legged man in the corner,
Hey - got to get, I got to get, I got to get away.

[Chorus:]
Long time you say,
No more letters,
No more letters,
No more letters,
No more letters,
No more letters,

Oooh dirty dog on the night flight,
Oooh dirty dog see the door,
Oooh dirty dog on the night flight,
Hey - got to get, I got to get, I got to get away.

Oooh dirty dog don't give a damn if you're wrong or right,
Oooh dirty dog sitting there looking at me all night,
Oooh dirty dog,
Oooh dirty dog,
