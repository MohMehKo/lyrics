Well, Big Jim came a calling
And said there is going to be a raid
My boys get dressed to kill he said
And don't you be afraid
Old Jobo was ready to tie it up
With their rifles in their hands
When we started out we got so scared
We didn't hardly stand

Walk right back
Walk right back
Walk right back
Oh let it roll

Well, as we turned the corner
I heard a shotgun sound
I thought my time was coming
But Old Jobo hit the ground

In thought of us were fifteen
Of the meanest looking man
As we walked on I realised
Our number is only ten

Walk right back
Walk right back
Walk right back
Oh let it roll

Let it roll

Ooh, yeah

Now the next thing I remember
Big Jim let out a roar
He shouted come on boys
Let's go even up the score

It was one almighty blaze
We stood and watched them as they fled
Disappearing through the night

Oh, I can go

Walk right back
Walk right back
Walk right back
Oh let it roll

Oh, let it roll
Walk right back
Walk right back
Back, back, backâ€¦
