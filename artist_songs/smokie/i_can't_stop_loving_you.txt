You can do, whatever you want to do
You can do, anything at all
'Cause what you do
Makes me so close to you
And when I'm close to you baby

I can't stop loving you
There's nothing in the world that I would change for you
Only you, only you can thrill me like you do

I can't stop loving you
I can't stop wanting you
You're something special in my eyes

The way that you love me
The way that you hold me
The way that you make me feel part of you baby
