this life has taken me so far and so many roads
I've had to choose
Some win, some lose
this life has been a gamble,
I held my cards close to my chest
I've played the part
Somehow the mists of time have washed all over me
the comfort of your arms is where I need to be
(Cause) when you're lyin' in the arms
of the one you love
And you got your faith in God above
And you feel like you're riding on the wind
When you're lyin in the arms of the one you love
and you know it's good fromm the stars above
Ooh, that's love
I get so tired of dreamin
where is the fire that burned inside
With all it's pride
the flame became a candle so fragile
with the autumn wind
the need to win
Somehow the sands of time weigh heavy over me
Wrapped in your lovin arms is where I'd
rather be
(Cause) when you're lyin' in the arms..
