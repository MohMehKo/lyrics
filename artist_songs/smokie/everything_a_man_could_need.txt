Ain't got no trouble, laid on my mind
Why worry about tomorrow, all the lonesome time
Through stormy weather, come rain or shine
There ain't no mountain, that I wouldn't climb
But if I got you, and the things that you do
Then I got everything, a loving man could ever need
But I need your loving all through the night
And I need your kissing to make me feel alright
Make me feel better, when I'm sad and blue
Lord I ain't nothing, baby without you
But if I got you and the things you do...
So if you ever need my love
Just call my name darling
and I'll be there
So if you ever need my love
Just call my name darling
and I'll be there
Cause If I got you and the things you do
Then I got everything a loving man could ever need
