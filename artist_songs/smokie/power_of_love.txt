When you can't sleep nights and you wonder why,
Without a friend and you wanna die.
Situation desperation, all you want is sympathy,
And sympathy is all you'll get,
Enough - you ain't found nothing yet,
Till you found the power of love.

Your beauty ain't so hard to see,
Your looks can make a fool of me,
You say the things I want to hear,
And tell me it won't disappear,
But I won't know until I find if there is any truth behind,
What you call the power of love.

It takes you, it makes you and sometimes it breaks you,
It fills you and thrills you and sometimes it kills you,
But I've been looking so hard to find it,
I ain't giving it any more time,
There's nothing you can do about this,
You will never live without it,
This is the power of love.
