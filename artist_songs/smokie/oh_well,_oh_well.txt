Oh well, oh well,
you're on your own again yes
And who can tell,
Maybe this time, that's how you'll stay
Too bad too bad,
He's gone and left you but it's
So sad so sad
I warned you about the things you say

You wonder why
You lose every guy
You don't even try
It's just the things you say

Hello hello,
Who's this you're talking to now
and so, and so
looks like you've found another day

You wonder why...

Now you've gone and brought him down
and he says he ain't hangin' around
you have told him that he's n good
He doesn't do the things he should
No wonder he has gone away
all that's left for
Oh well, oh well,
you're on your own again yes
And who can tell,
Maybe this time, that's how you'll stay
Too bad too bad,
He's gone and left you but it's
So sad so sad
I warned you about the things you say me to say is,

You wonder why...
