You never made life easy, running down your long dark winding road
Always criticizing my personal intentions you said that wasn't so

So you left with tears inside and foolishly I watched our demise
So why d'you come back to me when you know I can see that

The biggest lie of all was the one you told yourself
Every memory I have is that you didn't need my help
Every moment of the day I was sitting on this shelf
When the biggest lie of all was the one you told yourself

Don't ask me how I'm feeling, I'm not that fool from long ago, so long ago
You say you want to talk things over, I'm sorry but my heart says no
It just tells me so

It would be a mistake, you never give you just take
I'm really over you so there's nothing to do

The biggest lie of all was the one you told yourself
Every memory I have is that you didn't need my help
Every moment of the day I was sitting on this shelf
When the biggest lie of all was the one you told yourself

You left me in the dark so many years ago, so long ago
So just quit fooling with my heart because you have to go
I just want you to go

The biggest lie of all was the one you told yourself
Every memory I have is that you didn't need my help
Every moment of the day I was sitting on this shelf
When the biggest lie of all was the one you told yourself
