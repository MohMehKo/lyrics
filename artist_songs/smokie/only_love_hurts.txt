When you try and you try for the best things in life
You can face another day
And your love's been thrown back in your lonely face
Yes, you threw it all away

I've tried so many times but I get caught up inside
My mind gets so closed when it should be open wide

But only love hurts
When you're down and in love with someone who don't want you
Only love hurts
When she don't want to be by your side
Only love hurts
When the truth is there to see
Only love hurts
Only love hurts

Dear, look out your window, see the sun
Oh, it might as well be rain
And your sleepless nights with a long cold sweat
You feel the pain again

I've tried so many times but my heart got in the way
And I tell myself, tomorrow's another day

But only love hurts
When you're down and in love with someone who don't want you
Only love hurts
When she don't want to be by your side
Only love hurts
When the truth is there to see
Only love hurts
Only love hurts

Well I tried and I tried but fade didn't die
As I face another day
And the words that you said ran too close in my head
Maybe love will come one day

I've tried so many times but I get caught up inside
My mind gets so closed when it should be open wide

Only love hurts
When you're down and in love with someone who don't want you
Only love hurts
When she don't want to be by your side
Only love hurts
When the truth is there to see
Only love hurts
Only love hurts
