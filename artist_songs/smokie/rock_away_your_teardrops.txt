Rock away your teardrops
Rock away your teardrops

Did he tell you he loved you
Did he tell you he needed you
Well he lied to you
Like they always do
Did you fall for his words
Words you must have heard
So many times
Still your love is blind

You should know better by now
I thought you'd learned your lesson
You should know better by now
Girl, girl

You must rock away your teardrops
Rock away, rock away, rock away
Rock away your teardrops
Rock away, rock away, rock away
Rock away your teardrops
(Oh oh oh oh)
Rock away, rock away, rock away

Did he sent you his letters
Did he ever remember
To write to you
The way lovers do, oh no
Was he ever on time
Did he show all the signs
I thought you'd see
Believe in me

You should know better by now
I thought you'd learned your lesson
You should know better by now
Girl, girl

You must rock away your teardrops
Rock away, rock away, rock away
Rock away your teardrops
Rock away, rock away, rock away
Rock away your teardrops
(Oh oh oh oh)
Rock away, rock away, rock away

Rock away
Rock away

So he told you he loved you
So he told you he needed you
Well he lied to you
Like they always do
Like they always do

Rock away your teardrops (Rock away your teardrops)
Rock away, rock away, rock away
Rock away your teardrops (Rock away your teardrops)
Rock away, rock away, rock away
Rock away your teardrops (Rock away your teardrops)
Rock away, rock away, rock away
Rock away your teardrops (Rock away your teardrops)
Rock away, rock away, rock away
Rock away your teardrops (Rock away your teardrops)
Rock away, rock away, rock away
Rock away your teardrops (Rock away your teardrops)
Rock away, rock away, rock away
Rock away your teardrops (Rock away your teardrops)
Rock away, rock away, rock away
Rock away your teardrops (Rock away your teardrops)
