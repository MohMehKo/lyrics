When you're going round in circles
And your head is for the rage
When you're fighting for a reason
Trying to turn another page
There's no hope in what you're doing
Try to reach another high
When your friends have gone and left you
Left you out to dry
In the memories they haunt you;
In the dark and in the light
From the jungle of the daytime
Till the jungle of the night
In the passion you're the moonlight
To the dawning of daylight
Oh, we see they try and loot you
It's a beard shoot fight.

Sometimes you cry
Sometimes you think it's not world wide
You're losing your sleep
You're losing your mind

In the days that went before you,
You could open any door
But the time run out of papers
And you don't work anymore
Get a hold of all your dreaming
Take them all down from the shelf
Turn your face toward the mirror
Then you'll see your real self

Sometimes you cry
Sometimes you think it's not world wide
You're losing your sleep
You're losing your mind

It's the real time in the real world
Take your feelings with some fright
Have spirit have some passion ghost
When spirit's gone you die
When this passion faces has gone from you
You'll end up wondering why
such a foolish thing could happen
Take your wings and start fly

Sometimes you cry
Sometimes you think it's not world wide
You're losing your sleep
You're losing your mind

Sometimes you cry
Sometimes you think it's not world wide
You're losing your sleep
You're losing your mind
