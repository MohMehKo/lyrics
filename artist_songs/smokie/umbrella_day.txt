We were walking, we were barely talking
It was late '63
Clouds were overloaded, and when they exploded
You said to me
Oh, oh, oh, look at the rain
Oh, oh, oh, umbrella day, throw it away
Out together it was stormy weather
We were soaked to the skin
Thunder crashing, we wee puddle splashing
and we started to sing
Oh, oh, oh, look at the rain
Oh, oh, oh, umbrella day, throw it away
Now look my way and see, just how wonderful
Rain can be, loving you loving me
It's going round, round, round
Down, down and down
Round round and round, down, down and down
we were calling at the water falling
As I fell to the ground
You and I, we really blessed the sky
Oh, for this new love we've found
Oh, oh, oh look at the rain
Oh, oh, oh, umbrella day
Oh, oh, oh , look at the rain
Oh, oh, oh, umbrella day
It's going round, round and round
Down, down and down
Round, round, and round, down down and down
