You took me by surprise,
The things you said, you know I never realised.
That I was just another fool within your eyes,
But now I know just what to do.

So I'll be on my way,
The games you play are not the games I care to play.
So keep your distance, I'll soon find another day,
There's nothing I would rather do.

[Chorus:]
Oh woman! when you hurt my pride it cut me deep inside,
Oh woman! you led me to believe it was only me,
Oh woman! you really took me in with all your sweet talkin'
Oh woman! oh I wonder if you knew all the pain you put
me through,
But how could I see what was in your eyes,
With your lies and your alibis,
Oh woman.

You took me for a ride,
Looking back, you know I laugh, but then I cried,
And now you see that slowly time has changed the tide,
so now the tables turned on you.

[Chorus:]
Oh woman! when you hurt my pride it cut me deep inside,
Oh woman! you led me to believe it was only me,
Oh woman! you really took me in with all your sweet talkin'
Oh woman! oh I wonder if you knew all the pain you put
me through,
But how could I see what was in your eyes,
with your lies and alibis.

[Chorus:]
Oh woman! when you hurt my pride it cut me deep inside,
Oh woman! you led me to believe it was only me,
Oh woman! you really took me in with all your sweet talkin'
Oh woman! oh I wonder if you knew all the pain you put me through,
And I'm still in love with you.
