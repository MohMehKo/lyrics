As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
But happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind, baby

The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come tumbling down
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand things pain much longer

I walk in shadows searching for light
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight
Hopin' and praying for someone who'll care
Always moving and going nowhere

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind, help me, please

I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone look, there's a growing need
All is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

Now what becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone to care
I'll be looking every day
I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothing gonna stop me now
I'll find a way somehow
And I'll be searching everywhere
I know I'll find it somewhere
