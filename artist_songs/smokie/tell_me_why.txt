I don't understand this
I don't really care
You know I didn't plan this
You know I wouldn't dare
Tell me I'm the man
Who brings the woman out in you
There's no other one
Who thrill me like you do
Tell me why you love me like you do
I can't understand or comprehend
this thrill when I'm with you
your my fantasy What you do to me
I know your heart is true
Tell me why you love me like you do
so don't misunderstand me
In you I have no doubt
Try to make this man see
How to work things out
cos babe I wanna give you
All you give to me
Make our hearts as one
For all eternity
Tell me why you love me like you do...
You gave me all the love and
Kindness that a man could need
You pick me up and spin my head
there are no words for how I fell
Tell me why you love me like you do...
Tell me why you love me like you do...
