The prettiest girl that I've ever seen
Was the one they call a teenage queen
She looked at me with her eyes so bright
And the way she smiled let me know I might
But I was only seventeen
When she turned and said to me

I wanna kiss your lips
I wanna hold you tight
I wanna lay with you until the morning light
I wanna kiss your lips
I wanna do it right
I wanna do the things, fill you with delight
Lately I've been saying baby, don't you know it's true
I wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make sweet love to you
I wanna make sweet love to you

I can only recall the day
'Cause you're the one who stole my heart away
The very first time that she took my hand
'Cause we started in all our one night stand
And every time when I started to dream
All her words came back to me

I wanna kiss your lips
I wanna hold you tight
I wanna lay with you until the morning light
I wanna kiss your lips
I wanna do it right
I wanna do the things, fill you with delight
Lately I've been saying baby, don't you know it's true
I wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make sweet love to you
I wanna make sweet love to you
