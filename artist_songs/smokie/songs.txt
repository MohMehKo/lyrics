Sing your songs out on the water
Echoes lively all around
Paint the sky with words of wisdom
Bring us back to solid ground.

Can I ask you where it came from
Will you tell me just the same
Thick and fast the sound it takes me
Throw your bars the song remains.

Celestial choirs that break my vision
Choral angels spread the sound
Paint the sky with words of wisdom
Bring us back to solid ground
Bring us back to solid ground.
