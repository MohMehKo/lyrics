A spaceman came traveling
On his ship from a far
It was light years away
Since his mission had start
And over a village
He halted his craft
And it hung in the sky like a star
Just like a star.

He followed the light
Came down to the shed
Where a mother and child
Where lying there on a bed
And a bright light of silver
Shone his head
And he had the face of an angel
And they were afraid.

And the stranger spoke
He said do not fear
I’ve come from a planet
A long way from here
And I bring a message
From mankind to hear
And suddenly the sweetest music
Had filled the air.

And it went
La, la, la
Peace and goodwill to all man
And love for the child

And it went
La, la, la
Peace and goodwill to all man
And love for the child.

This lovely music
Went trembling through the ground
And many were waken
On hearing the sound
And travelers on the road
The village they found
By the light of that ship in the sky
That shone all around.

And just before dawn
At the paling of the sky
The stranger returned
And said now I must fly
When two thousand years
Of your time has gone by
The song will begin once again
To a baby’s cry.

And it went
La, la, la
Peace and goodwill to all man
And love for the child.
