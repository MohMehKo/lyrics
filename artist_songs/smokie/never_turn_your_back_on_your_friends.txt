Isn't it a little strange
Though many years have come and gone
None of us have really changed
We've been friends for so very long
I wanna share with them
All the good times
It may be hard to work out
And seem to survive
It's why I'm wearing a heart on my sleeve
Give some meaning to our lives
And I would give to you
All that I have
Never turn your back on your friends
They're the ones that really care
Never turn your back on your friends
Cos when you need them they'll be there
And so here we are again
In a strange and dusty bar
Talking of friends we've known
Wondering where the hell they are
Yes sometimes its so sad
The way we drift apart
Never turn your back on your friends...
That long long road of life
Is never travelled with regret
Each of us was so strong
Because we're friends
Oh yeahh
I would give to you
All that I have
Ohh yeah
Never turn your back on your friends...
Never turn your back on your friends
They're the ones that really care
Never turn your back on your friends
Cos when you need them they'll be there
