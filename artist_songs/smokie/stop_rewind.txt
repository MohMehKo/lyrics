I get this feeling we've been here; here before
Well I couldn't talk, but you don't hear anymore
You never see my point of view
Don't care what I'm going through
No, I'm not getting through to you
I just know what I must do
Ohhh, you...

You'd better stop rewind
Give me time to change your mind
Ohhh, you got to stop reload
This thing is getting overload
Overload ...

It's no good shutting down, don't close the dark of me
Don't turn on run, unlock your heart, you hold the key
You never hear a word I say
Well I could stop and talk all day
But you just don't see things my way
I'm making you see reason come

You'd better stop rewind
Give me time to change your mind
Ohhh, you got to stop reload
This thing is getting overload
Overload ...

You never see my point of view
Don't care what I'm going through
No, I'm not getting through to you
I just know what I must do
Ohhh, you...

You'd better stop rewind
Give me time to change your mind
Ohhh, you got to stop reload
This thing is getting overload
Overload ...
