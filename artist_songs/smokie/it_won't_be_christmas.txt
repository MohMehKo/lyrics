Last year you gave me
Such a wonderful gift
All the loving in your heart
Was wrapped up in a kiss
It all seemed like wonderland
Season went so fast
Now it's all just memories
Like the ghost of Christmas past
So it won't be Christmas
Now you're not here
It won't be Christmas this year
Snow is falling and I can hear the children sing
It's gonna feel like Christmas this year
Last year you told me
That I was your king
Could've swore the choir sang
And bells began to ring
Felt just like a fairytale
There was magic in the air
Christmas just won't be the same
Nothing can compare
So it won't be Christmas...
So it won't be Christmas
Snow is falling
I can hear the children sing
So it won't be Christmas...
So it won't be Christmas...
