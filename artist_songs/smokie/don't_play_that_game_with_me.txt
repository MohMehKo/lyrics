Our love affair was like a movie show
So beautiful and true
Each piece of love was wild and full of fire
And the stars were me and you
How could I know you found another guy
The way you acted out your part
And then you stayed away so many nights
You knew then it would tear my heart apart
Don't play that game with me
Not that game with me
Your love never, never, never
will I share
Don't play that game with me
Not that game with me
With that other, other guy, it's not fair
You tried to tell me he was just fling
A little stop along the way
But I can tell it's something more than that
In spite of all the things you say
You've gotta choose between the two of us
You gotta choose that guy or me
I can't go on not knowing where I stand
If you want him, set me free, set me free
Don't play that game with me...
I'm tired of all your lies
You're playin with me
So stop your foolin around
I beg you, please
Don't play that game with me...
