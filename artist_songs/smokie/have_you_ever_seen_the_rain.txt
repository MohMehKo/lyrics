Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know - It's been coming for some time
When it's over so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know shining down like water
I want to know
have you ever seen the rain
I want to know
Have you ever seen the rain
comin' down on a sunny day
Yesterday and days before
sund is cold and rain is hard
I know - been that way for all my time
'till forever on it goes
Through the circle fast and slow
I know - and it can't stop I wonder
I want to know...
