Slow Down
Make it last
I'm having the time of my life
And take your photograph
I don't want to leave this behind
What seems so out of reach
We're holding it right in our hands
Let's give up everything
Let's jump in and never look back [x2]

[Chorus]
This is all I ever wanted
but life got in my way
You're all I ever wanted
I didn't see how it could change
That something was missing until today

The city comes alive
As soon as you walk through the door
Another sleepless night
But i don't want to sleep anymore
I don't want to sleep anymore

[Chorus]
This is all I ever wanted
But life got in my way
You're all I ever wanted
I didn't see how it could change
That something was missing until today

Climbing so high
just don't look down
we can see everything from here
for once in my life
feet off the ground
I don't wanna come back down

Take your photograph 
I'm having the time of my life

[Chorus]
This is all I ever wanted
But life got in my way
You're all I ever wanted
I didn't see how it could change
Nothing could get in the way
You're all i ever wanted
Didn't know what i was missing until today
