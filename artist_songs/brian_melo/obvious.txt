Those three words
You hid 'em for a rainy day
Let them out
Break the lock right off the safe
Don't you know
You don't have to be afraid
You're unsure 
Baby that's okay

[Chorus]
Just a look from you is a saving grace
All the questions start to fade away
Cause the answer's written on your face
Oh it's obvious to me
It's obvious to me

If I could
Do the same for you I would
Cause you keep falling in and out of love
I know your heart
Better than you know yourself
Give it time
It'll come around

[Chorus]
Just a look from you is a saving grace
All the questions start to fade away
Cause the answer's written on your face
Oh it's obvious to me

Are you still that girl in the photograph?
With me right there by your side
Was it just a dream we used to have
Or is it still, still alive

[Chorus]
Just a look from you is a saving grace
All the questions start to fade away
Cause the answer's written on your face
Oh it's obvious to me 
Ya it's obvious to me
Oh it's obvious to me
