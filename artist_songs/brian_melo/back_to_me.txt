Into the darkness of the night
Your shadow's almost real
But I can't touch you anymore
You've forgotten what to feel
Your words are empty and your heart
Isn't where it used to be
I'm here staring into space
Caught up in these memories

I don't want to see you in pain
I don't want to do this again

[Chorus]
You know I wish you well
You need to find your way
Listen to these words
Yeah, there's so much to say
This is hard as hell
I've got to set you free
You need to find your way
Back to me

I remember long ago
The fire burned right in your eyes
You used to light up this whole world
With the magic of your smile
Now I'm reaching out to you
But you look pass me everytime
Don't you know you wreck me more
With every single try

I don't want to see you in pain
I don't want to do this again

[Chorus]
You know I wish you well
You need to find your way
Listen to these words
Yeah, there's so much to say
This is hard as hell
I've got to set you free
You need to find your way
Back to me

Tired of hoping 
Tired of breaking
Tired of pretending
Tired of waiting
Tired of questions, the answer is clear

I don't want to see you in pain
I don't want to do this again

[Chorus]
You know I wish you well
You need to find your way
Listen to these words
Yeah, there's so much to say
This is hard as hell
I've got to set you free
You need to find your way

Come back to me [x5]
