I look in my eyes
Searching for signs of life
Digging through the darkness trying to see
Pity the sight
Try to wipe out last night
That's not the kind of guy I want to be

[Chorus]
Sweeping these city streets
Oh picking up the pieces
Torn and scattered at my feet
I'm down here on my knees asking for forgiveness
Hoping hard and begging please
Emily

It's not that I lied
Oh no, when I stopped trying
Was so sure you were mine
Turned my back to you
Cause, I never believed you could just up and leave me

Don't know what I should do
I'm not losing you again

[Chorus]
Sweeping these city streets
Oh picking up the pieces
Torn and scattered at my feet
I'm down here on my knees asking for forgiveness
Hoping hard and begging please

You're the one [x4]

[Chorus (x2)]
Sweeping these city streets
Oh picking up the pieces
Torn and scattered at my feet
I'm down here on my knees asking for forgiveness
Hoping hard and begging please

Emily [x4]
