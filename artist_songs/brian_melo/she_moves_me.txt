If I could write a book like Hemingway
Paint a masterpiece or two
Maybe if I could man a rocketship
And fly to the moon

If I could write the perfect symphony
Find a cure for some disease
Only then I'd have something to compare
The way it feels
The way I feel

[Chorus]
I thought that I'd seen it all
Guess I was wrong, so wrong
I thought that I'd seen it all
Guess I was wrong, so wrong
Cause nothing can move me like you

If I'd written Romeo and Juliet
Had my own star in Hollywood
If I could paint the world one color
I know I've been moved
I know I feel

The way I feel

[Chorus]
I thought that I'd seen it all
Guess I was wrong, so wrong
I thought that I'd seen it all
Guess I was wrong, so wrong
Cause nothing can move me like you

At the speed of light, she comes in
Takes me to places I've never been
She shows me the way to heaven
She moves me
She moves me

[Chorus (x2)]
I thought that I'd seen it all
Guess I was wrong, so wrong
I thought that I'd seen it all
Guess I was wrong, so wrong
Cause nothing can move me like you

If I'd written Romeo and Juliet
Had my own star in Hollywood
