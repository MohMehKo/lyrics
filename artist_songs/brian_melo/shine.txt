Every corner you turn
Walls are closing in
All the lights have changed from green to red
You're grounded by the weather
Nowhere to take flight
Somehow your wings got broken
Your hands are tied

But can't you feel it in the air
The moment has arrived
So why don't you

[Chorus]
Shine, cause I've been waiting for you to try
Set your sights high
And elevate yourself to the sky
Just rise and shine

Your shadow is behind you
When the sun's in your face
Your story isn't finished
Just turn the page
It's time to wake up
It's time to shake it up
The chains can be cut and thrown away

And can't you see it everywhere
The moment is alive
So why don't you

[Chorus]
Shine, cause I've been waiting for you to try
Set your sights high
And elevate yourself to the sky
Just rise and shine

Anticipating
I've been waiting
The moment has arrived
For you to
Shine
Just shine

[Chorus]
Shine, cause I've been waiting for you to try
Set your sights high
And elevate yourself to the sky
Just rise and shine [x2]
