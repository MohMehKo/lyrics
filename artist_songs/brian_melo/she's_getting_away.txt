In her eyes there's a trail of all she's seen
Cold as ice, a fugitive that time is chasing
Oh, she's got a ticket for every ride
Oh, and a different name that she's hiding behind

[Chorus:]
She's getting away
She's ready to fly
She's burning bridges in the sky
She's getting away
Front of the line
See how far she gets this time...

Like a spy moving secrets through the night
Stay awake, she'll slip away, don't close your eyes...
Oh, she's got a ticket for every ride
Oh, and a different name that she's hiding behind

[Chorus]

On and on, she keeps on moving on
But when will she come down
On and on, she keeps on moving on and on

[Chorus]
