Don't look at me, I can't make this right.
I can't help you, anymore than this.
Don't look at me, I can't fix your life
I can't walk in front of you this time
(oh no, oh no)

[Chorus:]
I wanna be, soundproof
So I can't hear what you say
I wanna be soundproof
but your words get in the way
(in the way)

Don't call on me, I don't need a fight
I won't tell you, everything's all right
I don't wanna be your only hope tonight
I don't really need to hear you cry this time, all right

I wanna be, soundproof
So I can't hear what you say
I wanna be soundproof
but your words get in the way

Just walk away, how many times do I have to say that I'm over it
Can't hear you say the same things again (again)

I wanna be, soundproof
So I can't hear what you say
I wanna be soundproof
but your words get in the way [x2]
