Flowers in the garden
Bloom for no one
Waiting for rain
Emerald street is empty
Time keeps dancing
Never be the same

Without you I'm so blind
Without you there's only silence now
And nothing else matters now

[chorus:]
Where should I go without you now
I'll fall at your feet and scream out loud
Don't wanna let go but I'm not proud
I'm still pretending, I'm still pretending...

Some day the things we thought about
But never talked about
We'll say out loud

Without you I'm still blind
Without you there's only silence now
And nothing else matters now

[chorus]

I can still see you there
I'm falling behind
All these pictures in my mind

[chorus]

Flowers in the garden
Bloom for no one
Waiting for rain...
