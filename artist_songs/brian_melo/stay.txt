Can you 
Tell me what you won't say
It's all I ask
Who knows
There's a chance I may be angry
But it won't last
Oh, turn around so I can see your eyes, won't you

[Chorus]
Stay with me
I'm not the only one who's broken promises
Stay with me
Cause in a world this cold
Don't you wanna be loved

How long
Before we break this silence 
Who will be the first
Are you sure
That your words have lost their meaning
Tell me where it hurts
Oh, turn around and I'll forgive your lies won't you

[Chorus]
Stay with me
I'm not the only one who's broken promises
Stay with me
Cause in a world this cold
Don't you wanna be loved

And even though your heart's gone cold again
And even though you try so hard to pretend 
That you're on your own
You're not alone

[Chorus]
Stay with me
I'm not the only one who's broken promises
Stay with me
Cause in a world this cold
Don't you wanna be loved
