I'll tie a message to a bird
Let it fly and spread the word
Over oceans and fields
Even though you're far away
I'm still living us day to day
And I'm wondering how you feel?

[Chorus:]
Can you weigh me in?
I can't spend my whole life just waiting
Can you weigh me in?
I can't spend my whole life just waiting for you
I'll still be waiting for you...

We've been lost and we've been found
How we turn this all around
Is up to you and me
Like trying to breathe where there's no air
We can't dismantle what is there
Tell me how you do feel?

[Chorus]

Like trying to breath where there's no air
We can't dismantle what is there
I gotta know how you feel...

[Chorus]
