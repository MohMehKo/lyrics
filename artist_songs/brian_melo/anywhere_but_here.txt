Drew a line across the moon
Threw a wave over the sea
Found a place in the sky
And I am working on believing
And the door's always closed
I wanna leave but I never go
And I'm dreaming I'm leaving home
But there's no leaving when you're already gone

[Chorus:]
I wanna run but don't know where
I wanna fly but I don't know how
I'm out on the edge and the future is finally there
It's anywhere but here
It's anywhere but here

Hold the line
Stay awake in the water
Stay awake and you'll find
That the coasts are all clear
And the stones have been skipped
And the ashes are scattered
And they'll never make a sign
Cause we're a million miles away

[Chorus:]
I wanna run but don't know where
I wanna fly but I don't know how
I'm out on the edge and the future is finally there
It's anywhere but here

Let them say I left too soon
I've got nothing left to lose
Hold the captives from the moon
And lay me under.
Who ever said it was easy?
Who ever said it was easy?
Easy

I wanna run
I wanna fly

[Chorus:]
I wanna run but don't know where
I wanna fly but I don't know how
I wanna run but don't know where
I wanna fly but I don't know how
I'm out on the edge and the future is finally there
It's anywhere but here
