Dry your eyes
'cause you're no fool
Don't believe everything
That they're telling you
You can climb your ladder to the sky
And view the world from your own satellite
Switch it on
Switch it on
The truth lies
So high
Don't wanna come down
Will you ever come down?

Hang on...
You gotta get back what you can
You gotta get back to yourself
Hang on...
You gotta get back what you can
Before you break what's in your hands
Hang on...

You don't need a hand
Don't need a clue
Just navigate
To what moves you
You can be that star that lights your sky
Put some colour in your darkest night
Switch it on
Switch it on
The truth lies
So high
Don't wanna come down
Will you ever come down?

Hang on...
You gotta get back what you can
You gotta get back to yourself
Hang on...
You gotta get back what you can
Before you break what's in your hands
Hang on...
