So many people
Try to stand in our way
Try to take away
What they don't have
What we are today

Started out cold
Then grew into something more
Oh how you got me twisted
Keeps me hanging on

[Chorus:]
The story of us
I won't forget
The story of us
I got my heart set
On the story of us

So complicated
There's no way to put it in words
They say love's over-rated
If it is then why does it hurt

Started out cold
Then grew into something more
Oh how you got me twisted
Keeps me hanging on

[Chorus]
