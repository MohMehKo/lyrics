Sinking into a wave
Slipping into a crack in the concrete
You've been hiding for days
No one even knows you're missing
Dreaming in your sleep
Screaming "oh oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh"
You broke the heart on your sleeve
Singing "oh oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh..."

[chorus:]
You love - you feel
You need - you want
Life gets hard
That's the truth
But you'll pull through
You laugh - you cry
You look for hope
Life gets hard
That's the truth...

Crashing into your scene
You can't get out from underneath
You're broke apart at the seams
And it's...
"oh oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh" [x2]

[chorus]

You'll make it
You'll be fine
Just take your time

You love
You feel
You need
You want
Life get's hard
That's....the truth.

[chorus]
