Tell me
What did you wear?
Innocence and red, well,
I really don't care
How it's all been easy
And why you're not lonely 
I didn't need to know how
He gets you loud

[Chorus]
I stumbled through the fire on my own
Burns a little more now, the seasons are gone
Centuries spent together, back to back
Someone give me more now
I need this to last
In the beat of the hour

Sweetness, the bubble did burst
Maybe for the better 
That I knew first
Given all the secrets 
You had to find
Well, everyone's got needs, but,
What about mine?

[Chorus]
I stumbled through the fire on my own
Burns a little more now, the seasons are gone
Centuries spent together, back to back
Someone give me more now
I need this to last

Somehow I'm failing in this war
A little advice won't help at all
Yeah, now I'm failing in this war
This little lie won't mend my soul

[Chorus]
I stumbled through the fire all alone
Burns a little more now, the seasons are gone
I have wasted centuries, always, 
But in my own sweet time, I'm
I stumbled through the fire
Sweet, sweet fire
Sweet, sweet
