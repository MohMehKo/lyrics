Where should I even begin
It just started sinking in
Made a world where I could live
Gave me all you had to give
Took nothing in return

Oh I, wish I could describe the feeling
But I, couldn't find the words to say

[Chorus]
Who's watching over you
While you're helping me find my way
All the things that I went through
I thank God that I met you
I hope the day comes soon
Comes soon

Took me underneath your wing
Showed me everything I'd never thought I'd see
You taught me how to face my fears
Now it's all so clear
So clear

I, wish I could describe the feeling
Oh, if only I could find the words to say

[Chorus]
Who's watching over you
While you're helping me find my way
All the things that I went through
I thank God that I met you
I hope the day comes soon
When I'm half as good as you [x2]

And I've got so much to live up to
Who's watching over you
While you're helping me find my way

[Chorus]
Who's watching over you
While you're helping me find my way
All the things that I went through
I thank God that I met you
I hope the day comes soon [x2]

When I'm half as good as you
