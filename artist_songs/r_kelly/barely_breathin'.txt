It feels like I'm losing air
I can't catch my breath no matter what I do
And I feel so sick cause you're not there
And girl I need your hand if I'm gonna pull through
Cause I'm lying in my dying bed
And I've been dying since the day you left
Oh, it feels like I'm walking toward the light
I won't live another lonely night

Cause I'm barely breathin'
Without you
Hoping you will come back home
I'm hanging on
But I'm barely breathin'
Without you
You could save my life with your return
Can't you hear my yearn
I'm barely breathin'

It feels just like I've been knocked down
I don't know if I'm gonna ever rise again
And the sky looks like a big dark cloud
GIrl I need you by my side
To help my breathing
You got me lying in my dying bed
And I've been dying ever since you left
It feels just like I'm walking towards the light
And I won't live another lonely night

Cause I'm barely breathin'
Without you
Hoping you will come back home
I'm hanging on
But I'm barely breathin'
Without you
You could save my life with your return
Can't you hear my yearn
I'm barely breathin'

I should be dead by now
But I'm latching on to hopes
That you'll come take me out this coma that I'm in
You still got time, I can't come back from the dark and lonely place
Cause our love is enough reason
For you to start my heart beating

Cause I'm barely breathin'
Without you
Hoping you will come back home
I'm hanging on
But I'm barely breathin'
Without you
You could save my life with your return
Can't you hear my yearn
I'm barely breathin'...
