[Cathy:]
See, Rufus is going to have to understand that he has a wife, and she loves him
Now, I vowed on that day that we got married that I would always be there for him
Now, it's a big responsibility to be a pastor of a church, I understand
But to be a pastor, you have to practice what you preach, and be a responsible man
Now, regardless to all the mistakes we made, he's going to have to make a choice
Now, it's me or whatever the... hell he is
Or, damn it, I want a divorce

[Dr. William T. Perry:]
...got your text message. I love you too, honey. Okay, bye

Rufus, Cathy, how you doing? Come on in, have a seat
Can I get you something to drink?

[Cathy:]
No, I'd rather just get right to it

[Perry:]
Alright

[Rufus:]
I'll take a water, doc

[Perry:]
One water coming up
Shirley, can you bring a water in?

[Shirley:]
Evian or sparkling?

[Rufus:]
Sparkling

[Shirley:]
Sir, would you like that on ice?

[Cathy:]
Please, can we get right down to it?
That would be nice

[Rufus:]
No ice, please

[R. Kelly:]
Session One

[Perry:]
So, you've been having problems in your relationship
I want you to take your time and just elaborate on it
Do you mind if I tape this?

[Rufus, Cathy:]
Yes. No

[Rufus:]
I mean... I mind

[Cathy:]
Yeah, I know you do

[Rufus:]
Well, you shouldn't want our business recorded, either!

[Cathy:]
What business?!, Rufus, it seems like everybody already knows!

[Rufus:]
Yeah, and just what everybody are you referring to?

[Cathy:]
Oh, everybody!
Everybody...
They know about Chuck...
Me and you

[Rufus:]
Yeah, well what about Sylvester, huh?
And you and him
Do they know about that, too?

[Cathy:]
Yeah, I guess they do...
Do you mind if I smoke?

[Perry:]
Go right ahead...
Well, let's do this
Before this all gets out of hand
Just talk about your main concerns
And what bothers you about this relationship the most
Cathy, you go first
And Rufus, listen and try to understand

[R Kelly:]
Cathy starts telling the doc, how, in the beginning, everything was fine
Then, outta nowhere, she starts crying and screaming, and putting everything out on the line

[Cathy:]
And everything he told me
I mean, everything I believed
And I just don't understand, doc, how he could want another man over me, oh!

[Perry:]
How do you feel about that, Rufus?

Rufus?

[Rufus:]
When I first met Cathy, it was just like... meeting Heaven
I had just finished school, and became a reverend
And everything I needed, she provided...

[Cathy:]
What happened, Rufus?!

[Rufus:]
But then I met Chuck, and somehow got misguided!

[Cathy:]
Oh!

[Perry:]
So you went off the road that you were meant to travel?

[Rufus:]
Yes, I did!

[Cathy:]
Despite the fact you knew every word in the Bible, Rufus!

[Rufus:]
I'm sorry!

[Perry:]
Don't look at me, look at Cathy!

[Rufus:]
I'm sorry!

[Cathy:]
You really went and screwed things up, Rufus!

[Rufus:]
Cathy, please! I'm sorry!

[Cathy:]
So, tell me this! Do you love him?

[Rufus:]
Baby, I'm sorry! Sorry!

[Cathy:]
Rufus, do you love him?!

[Rufus:]
Help me, Lord!

[Cathy:]
Doc, I'm out of here, I've tried!
I've done all I can!

[Rufus:]
YES! Yes! Yes! Yes

[Cathy:]
Yes, what, Rufus?

[Rufus:]
I still love that man!

[Perry:]
Wait a minute, Mrs. Longs

[Cathy:]
I'm gone

[Perry:]
Let's work it out

[Cathy:]
No

[Perry:]
Rufus, Mrs. Longs!

[Cathy:]
Looks like Rufus already worked it out!
I'm out of here!

[Rufus:]
Cathy...

[Perry:]
Pastor, wait
I'll go speak to her

[Rufus:]
...What have I done?
