Baby, this Christmas
My gift to you will be... me

So far away, it's been too long
Seems like a billion days since I've been gone
All my thoughts and prayers askin' of you
Well guess what, baby: I've got some good news

I had a talk with my boss
I took some time off

I'm comin' home for Christmas
I'm comin' home for Christmas (baby, baby)
I'm comin' home for Christmas (be ready, be ready now)
I'm comin' home for Christmas (and I'll be bearin' the gift of love)

Oh workin' baby, day and night
I hardly ever get to spend quality time
I can't take it, no, your love I miss it
And I'll be seein' ya soon because I got myself a ticket

I had a talk with my boss
I took some time off

I'm comin' home for Christmas
I'm comin' home for Christmas (baby, baby)
I'm comin' home for Christmas (be ready, be ready now)
I'm comin' home for Christmas (and I'll be bearin' the gift of love)

Won't let another minute, hour, day go by
Or spend another second, girl, without you by my side
(Spend this Christmas) I refuse to spend this Christmas
Said I refuse to spend this Christmas
Without my baby by my side
Surprise, surprise

I'm comin' home for Christmas
I'm comin' home for Christmas (straight home to you, baby, baby)
I'm comin' home for Christmas (so have your arms open for me)
And I'll be carrying the gift of love (and I'll be bringin' this lovin' home to you)

Walk in the door, you standin' there
Make love to you everywhere
I'm so excited I'm comin' home for Christmas
(Christmas, yeah, Christmas, yeah)
