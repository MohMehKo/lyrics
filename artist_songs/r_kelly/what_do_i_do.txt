Heard you speak one time in an interview
Was the sweetest lil' thing I ever heard
(Sweetest lil' thing I heard)
My eyes going down on you like a parachute
I wanna creep wit' you and that's my word
(Creep wit' you and that's my word)
Now I been knowin, mommy, for a while now
(A long time)
And GOD know she's been good to me
(Real good, real good)
But uh, I can't help it when I see you smile
Some thing tells me what I'm doin to her
That you would do to me

So what do I do...

What do I do
What do I do
What do I do
Some body tell me what will I gain
What will I lose
What do I do
What do I do
What do I do
Somebody tell me what will I gain
What will I lose
Help me out

Now Proverbs 18 verse 22 says
Standin' by the wife defines a good thing
Lyin' by her side thinkin' of you
I got to get up, go to the toilet
Wash my face, and clear my head
I gotta take you to a broad way show
Cause I don't wanna go by self
I'm like a kid wit' two ice creams, baby
And I don't want either one to melt
Cause ever since I heard you speak in that interview
It is an awful feelin' if I hurt her
Then some day you gonna hurt me too

What do I do
What do I do
What do I do
Some body tell me
What will I gain
What will I lose
What do I do
What do I do
What do I do
Some body tell me
What will I gain
What will I lose

I heard that
What goes around
Comes back around
And you're gonna read what you saw
Then everyone knows
