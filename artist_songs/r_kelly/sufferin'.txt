I got a mansion
Surrounded by gates
Maybach and a Rolls Royce
Sitting in my driveway
Got a big old yacht
Made of gold and cherry wood
Now you may look at me and think that everything is good
Well I may be smiling like I'm having a good time
But if you look in my eyes you'll see way down deep inside

I'm sufferin'
(Sufferin')
I'm sufferin'
(Sufferin')
I'm sufferin'
(Sufferin')
Oh yeah
(Sufferin')
I got everything a man could want
But ever since my baby's been gone
I've been sufferin'

Well I got so much land
I tell you I could build a city
I been around the world and partied with woman that show up pretty
There's been times when my luck couldn't get no better
But though my sun may shine I got stormy weather
Well I may be smiling like I'm having a good time
But if you look in my eye you see way down deep inside

I'm sufferin'
(Sufferin')
I'm sufferin'
(Sufferin')
I'm sufferin'
(Sufferin')
Oh yeah
(Sufferin')
I got everything a man could want
But ever since my baby's been gone
I've been sufferin'

Hey I got a private jet
Take me anywhere I wanna go
I'm getting big paychecks
From all of my sold out shows
I'm on top of the world living like a boss
Until that girl up and laid me off
Well you may look at me like I'm having a good time
But if you look in my eye you see way down deep inside

I'm sufferin'
(Sufferin')
I'm sufferin'
(Sufferin')
I'm sufferin'
(Sufferin')
I'm no good
(Sufferin')
I got everything a man could want
But ever since my baby's been gone
I've been sufferin'
