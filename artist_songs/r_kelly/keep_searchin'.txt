Search for me, find me
Search for me, find me
Search for me, find me
Search for me, find me

You keep searchin'
You keep searchin'
You keep searchin'
You keep searchin'
I'm right here, I'm right here
I'm right here, baby
Love's in your face

I'll do anything to please you
Baby, tell me what to do
Let me get out those shoes
I'll be your slave if you want me to
Just give me the chance and I'll prove it babe
There's nobody else that knows how to do it babe
I'm on fire, girl, for you
Wanna burn down this room
Don't you run away from the truth
Whisper in my ear and tell me you feel it too
Girl, why do you

You keep searchin'
You keep searchin'
You keep searchin'
You keep searchin'
(When) I'm right here, right here
I'm right here, baby
Love's in your face
Shh, shh, shh

It don't matter what it is
All the things you need, girl, I'll give
If it's here you want me to live
Snap your fingers, babe (It's like magic)
I want to take you away from this world
To my place of ecstasy and make you my girl
Touchin' on your body, kissin' on your body
I don't want nobody, it's all about your body
You've been driftin', babe
Bring it to me, babe
It's all right here, babe
So stop lookin, babe
Girl, why do you

[x2]
You keep searchin'
You keep searchin'
You keep searchin'
You keep searchin'
(When) I'm right here, I'm right here
I'm right here, baby
Love's in your face

Open your eyes
Said I'm right here, baby just
Open your eyes
And I want you, girl, to be my
Open your eyes
To be my baby
Open your eyes
So stoppin' runnin
Open your eyes
Stop searchin' babe
Open your eyes
What you need is right here
Come and get it
You can have it
