Kells, yo, I can't keep doin' this
I got to say something
Ya feel me?
See, I just can't keep living life confused
Girl, we gotta make a move
Tell me something, cause uh

First, you wanna go, then you wanna stay
And then you wanna talk about it, baby
Put ya bag down, and pick ya bag up
And then you just walk out on me, baby
If love were ice, then I can see a future in what we're doing, baby
Girl, I'm not tryin' to confuse ya
Just wanna spend my life wit' you, baby

(Girl, please tell me where do we go from here?)
Girl, I wanna change your name to my name
And I know you feel the same way, so
Girl, let's just go get far away from here
And let it beat, let our hearts beat
Take a deep breath, now, baby, hold on

(Hold on) And girl, don't let go
(Hold on) Yeah, just keep holdin' on
(Hold on) Baby, we'll walk through the storm together
(Hold on) Oh yeah, girl, I promise you this love's forever

First, you say you love me
Then you say, well, I don't know
We both feel same
So baby, what the hell, let's go
You holla at ya friends
I'll handle the streets
Let's just let 'em all know
Girl, I gotta be with you if I'm gonna be free
Cause you are my soul, yeah

Tell me
(Girl, please tell me where do we go from here)
Girl, I wanna change your name to my name
And I know you feel the same way, too
Let's go far away from here
And let it beat, let our hearts beat
Take a deep breath now, baby, hold on

(Hold on) And girl, don't let go
(Hold on) Just keep holdin' on
(Hold on) Yeah, girl, we'll walk through the storm together
(Hold on) And I promise this love is forever

(Although, we've come from two different worlds)
Baby, that doesn't matter to me
Cause my world is you, yeah
(Who would've thought we would get this far?)
And I don't care what the world may say
It's you and me against all odds

(Hold on) Hold on, and baby, be strong
(Hold on) We can make it, baby, if we just hold on
(Hold on) We'll walk through the storm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Hold on) Just hold on, just hold on
(Hold on) Hold on, just hold on

(We're gonna make it, baby)
(We're gonna make it, baby)
(We're gonna make it, baby)
