Oooh, oh my darling
Oh my love yeah
Oooh oh oh, yeah yeah

Staring at the Christmas tree
Thinking about having a Christmas party
We're in the club and haven't been playing
Everybody's so in love with everybody

I'll sing a song friends will tag along
Oh the mood is perfect like it's supposed to be
La la la la la
So have no fear
Christmas spirit's here
I'm gonna dress up, gonna celebrate this year

Oh this Christmas, I'll be stepping
Stepping, stepping, stepping
Oh this Christmas, I'll be grooving
Grooving, grooving, grooving

Oh there's nothing better than
Friends and family getting together
On this night we're celebrating love
There's never anything wrong
With people getting along
Doesn't matter what the color

I'll sing a song friends and will tag along
Oh the mood is perfect just like it's supposed to be
La la la la la
So have no fear
Christmas spirit's here
I'm gonna dress up, gonna celebrate this year

Oh this Christmas, I'll be stepping
Stepping, stepping, stepping
Oh this Christmas, I'll be grooving
Grooving, grooving, grooving

I can hear oh
I can hear the sleigh bells ringing
I can see couples under mistletoe
There's so many happy faces on the dance floor
Love is a universal language we all know

Oh this Christmas, I'll be stepping
Stepping, stepping, stepping
Oh this Christmas, I'll be grooving
Grooving, grooving, grooving
Oh this Christmas, I'll be stepping
Stepping, stepping, stepping
For this Christmas hey, I'll be grooving
Grooving, grooving, grooving

Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright

Alright, alright, alright
You got a drink in your hand
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright
Keep stepping y'all
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright
The spirit of Christmas is in this place
Alright, alright, alright
I can tell by the smile on your faces
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright
Now if you wanna jingle
Ride your partner hit the floor
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright
Jingle to the left, jingle to the right
If you're gonna jingle through the latter
You're gonna jingle through the night
Jingle to the left I see you, jingle to the right
If you're gonna jingle through the latter
You're gonna jingle through the night
Jingle to the left, jingle to the right
Alright, alright, alright
If you're gonna jingle through the latter

You're gonna jingle through the night
Alright, alright, alright
Jingle to the left, jingle to the right
