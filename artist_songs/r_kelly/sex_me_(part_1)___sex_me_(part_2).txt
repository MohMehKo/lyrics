Yea 1993 Check this freaky style i was born with 

I feel so freaky tonight 
And i need someone to make me feel alright
So bring your body here baby
Lady have no fear
Im gonna fulfill your fantasies
Just as long as you

Music...
Sex me
Come on come on come on come on

Sex me, baby baby sex me (sex me baby) sex me sex me baby sex me.

Come over here and let me take off your clothes
Cause things I wanna do to you, nobody has to know(know baby). 
Just lay your body right here, 
Lady have no fear cause ecstacy is near (ooh baby)
Any unexpected positions, bring it on. 
Any secret fantasies you see I'll fulfill as long as you sex me.

[Chorus]
Sex me, baby baby sex me (sex me baby) sex me sex me baby sex me.

Now let me feel your body next to mine. 
Cause girl I wanna feel you sweat, girl 
You're so very wet. 
Now put me inside of you do what you wanna do. 
Cause you got a need for me and I got a need for you,(baby any)
Any unexpected positions (bring it on)
Any secret fantasies, you see I'll fulfill, as long as you sex me.

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Umm..let me kiss you in the right place, 
So I can see sex me baby 
Written on your face,
Slow baby slow baby steady as we go. 
Up and down to a sixty-nine tempo. 
Yeah turn your body parts around 
And let me hear you make a 
Ooh-ah sound. 
Cause I'm your lover man. 
So call your other man and say you 
Found another man.

[Chorus 3x]
