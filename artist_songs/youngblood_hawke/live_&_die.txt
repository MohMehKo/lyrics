Live and die along the way
Live and die along the way
Live and die along the way
Live and die along the way

Follow the lights
Strange lights that shine from the sky and move the floor
Show 'em what no ones shown before
Your pulled out from underneath the storm

I follow your eyes
Young eyes that stare through the walls a thousand miles
Away from this place that runs you wild
But I only wish you'd stay a while

You're moving at the speed of sound
Who's ever going to slow you down
Gonna find my fortune
Gonna steal our fame
Gonna live and die along the way
Gonna reach up higher
Gonna feel the flames
Live and die along the way

Live and die along the way
Live and die along the way

Follow your heart
Young heart thats pulling you out beyond the grave
Rushing to find your own escape
Follow the roads to save the day

You're flying at the speed of sound
Who's ever going to slow you down
Gonna find my fortune
Gonna steal our fame
Gonna live and die along the way
Gonna reach up higher
Gonna feel the flames
Live and die along the way

Live and die along the way
Live and die along the way
Live and die along the way
Live and die along the way

Gonna find my fortune
Gonna steal our fame
Gonna live and die along the way
Gonna reach up higher
Gonna feel the flames
Live and die along the way

Gonna find my fortune
Gonna steal our fame
Gonna live and die along the way
Gonna reach up higher
Gonna feel the flames
Live and die along the way

Gonna reach up higher 
Gonna feel the flames
Live and die along the way
