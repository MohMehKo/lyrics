Apache heart, 
You're headed to the border with broken hands, 
Searching for refuge underneath the sand, 
You keep callin' out to the skies.
Yeah you keep crying out to the night.
Yeah you keep crying out to the night

I keep on wishing we all could find the time to,
see all the visions thats been crossing your mind,
crossing your mind

We've been waiting for these dreams to feel real for so long, 
Now we have 'em in our hands all we have to do is stay strong

Apache heart, 
You see there's a fight in every man, 
Another road never leading home again, 
You keep climbing up to the skies,
Yeah you keep crying out to the night
Yeah you keep crying out at night

I keep on wishing we all could find the time to 
See all the visions thats been crossing your mind

You've been sayin' that we've been prayin' for so long
So long

We've been waiting for these dreams to feel real for so long, 
Now we have 'em in our hands all we have to do is stay strong

We've been waiting for these dreams for so long,
So long

I'll never wait for days you're living underneath the trees,
And I never got to say that you know what I'm gonna believe,
What I believe in: You've got to pay for the rain that's fallen,
You've got to pay for the way the that we're runnin',
And though I know, I know, shouldn't have waited for the light,
I know, I know, I wouldn't take it

We've been waiting for these dreams to feel real for so long, 
Now we have 'em in our hands all we have to do is stay strong
