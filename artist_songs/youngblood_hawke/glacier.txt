Wailin' wind is ripping off my windows
Expose sky to me
Friends of mine swim so far
That they cant be reached
Leave a little in your wayside wake

From the islands that we've crossed
To the time we think we've lost
From the cages to the castles that well make
From the islands that we've crossed
We shake the water off
Like a silver glacier slowly shrinks away

Saw it in the newspaper
Write whatever you like
Every single word that is on your mind
Every single time that you feel inclined
You have to unwind

From the islands that we've crossed
To the time we think we've lost
From the cages to the castles that well make
From the islands that we've crossed
We shake the water off
Like a silver glacier slowly shrinks away

I never saw you
I never saw you leave
I never saw you
I thought you'd see me
I never saw you
I never saw you leave
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

From the islands that we've crossed
To the time we think we've lost
From the cages to the castles that well make
From the islands that we've crossed
We shake the water off
Like a silver glacier slowly shrinks away

From the islands that we've crossed
To the time we think we've lost
From the cages to the castles that well make
From the islands that we've crossed
We shake the water off
Like a silver glacier slowly shrinks away
