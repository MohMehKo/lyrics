You say you won't wait forever on me
But I wouldn't make you wait that long

Sang drunk in my room Geronimo
Like an old great singer throat full of smoke
Shut the door to the attic, made myself a home
I pay no attention to what's down below

'Cause I don't want to break the bars
If I run they'll be a bust 'cause there's dogs on my tail
But my tracks are in the mud
And your Comanche spirit that's afraid to fail
Do everything you can now or you never will

You say you won't wait forever on me
But I wouldn't make you wait that long
You say you won't wait forever on me
But I wouldn't make you wait that long

So I followed all the trails to Monaco
Who the hell am I to tell you where to go?
Smokestacks and chimneys billow from my chest
Breaking into the house just to see what's left

'Cause time is watching all of us
And we all have the time
It's always on your mind
It's always on my mind

You say you won't wait forever on me
But I wouldn't make you wait that long

So don't you get scared, scared of nothing
'Cause I'm staying right here
Don't be afraid  'cause I won't leave you all alone

You say you won't wait forever on me
But I wouldn't make you wait that long
You say you won't wait forever on me
But I wouldn't make you wait that long
