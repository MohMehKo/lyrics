Wake up
Wake up

Too young to be scared
Optimistic, tell the truth she don't care
Locks her lips, she ke-ga-go ke-ga-go
She got over my head
So wake up you dreamy boy
You're harnessing a giant
And you're painting on my wings
In red paint and my wings are feather white
Police sirens up
So you're an angel true in a movie down my street

Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside, a world outside
Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside your window
Wake up

You can't force change or change your path
You just have to walk on it, the woods at night
With red walls, leisurely slow, no one sees you moving but you
So long my friends
I think it's time you try again
So wake up, wake up

Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside, a world outside
Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside your window

A world outside, a world outside
Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside your window
Your window, your window

Wake up
Wake up

Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside, a world outside
Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside your window

A world outside, a world outside
Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside your window
Your window, your window
