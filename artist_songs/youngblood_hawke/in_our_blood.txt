We are just at the beginning just at the beginning
We are obviously winning, obviously winning
Its in our blood, its in our blood

You're sitting outside with the city far below
Your eyes are welling up, decide to let it go
No point in being down its a choice that you make
If it wasn't for your sister baby, you'd be far away
But you live down the block so you can keep her safe
Washing dishes in the evening while you whistle all the way
Do it for the way it makes your heart beat, rage, and burst
When were all living like this you know it wont get worse

Its in our blood, its in our blood
we all want some
Its in our blood, its in our blood

Burn the hills down to defeat it till its hidden and retreated
Run boy, run boy, you know that you see it
Follow every passage way till you pick your place to stay
Till then run like hell towards the things that make a person great

We are just at the beginning just at the beginning
We are obviously winning, obviously winning
We all want some its in our blood, its in our blood
We all need some its in our blood, its in our blood
We are just at the beginning just at the beginning
We are obviously winning, obviously winning
