The last time I saw you
You were running to catch a train
Hand full of smoke I'd never see again
Wondering if you could take me
We could leave this car behind

Woke up in the rubble
Making do with what we had
The sound of Eden ringing
No coming back
Wondering if you could save me
We could leave this all behind

Let go
Drive me up the highway
Far from drowning life
The sleepless streets are calling
Calling me tonight

Let's go
Drive me up the highway
Far from drowning life
The sleepless streets are calling
Calling me tonight

Some things are better off
When they're left behind
We can't keep this up
And you seem surprised
Shake it off and now we're roaming

Hypnotized in the dark and free
I followed you down
When my eyes could barely see
Made it through the waves
When we could barely breathe
No more balancing on burning bridges
Now all we got is time

Let go
Drive me up the highway
Far from drowning life
The sleepless streets are calling
Calling me tonight

Let's go
Drive me up the highway
Far from drowning life
The sleepless streets are calling
Calling me tonight

We've been taken by the night
Taken by the night
These silver streets are taking me

Let go
Drive me up the highway
Far from drowning life
The sleepless streets are calling
The sleepless streets are calling
The sleepless streets are calling
The sleepless streets are calling
The sleepless streets are calling
Calling me tonight
Calling me tonight
Calling me tonight
Calling me tonight
Calling me tonight
