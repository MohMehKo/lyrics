[Intro]
 5-4-3 5-3-2 5-5-5-5-5-5-5 
Shake it off

[1st Verse] 
Chillin' in the club, got my boys with me 
And the parties all jumpin' in the VIP 
The DJ's playin my favorite beat and I'm havin' a good time (baby) 
Look across the room what did I see 
A really fly girl who needs to leave with me 
She was burnin up the place she was shakin' and shakin' 
She was so fine, so fine

[Chorus] 
It took me 5 months (just to get to know your name) 
5 weeks (to show you I ain't playin' games) 
5 days (before you'd even let me call over to your house, baby) 
5 hours (on the phone beggin' you) 
5 minutes (now I'm here kissin' you) 
5 seconds (you got me in a shaky mood, now is the time) 
Somebody better shake it off (shake it off) 
Shake it off, shake it off, shake it off I know you wanna shake it off, shake it off 
So shake it off, shake it off 
Shake it off, shake it off, shake it off 
Oh baby please shaaaake it off 
So shake it off, shake it off 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Shake it off

[2nd Verse] 
Now I wanna know come show me how 
I really wanna learn how you get down 
Don't make me wait, girl I'm ready now 
Let's get busy one time 
She started shakin' that body from left to right 
Didn't even get tired she could do it all night 
This girl put it on me just the way I like I think I love her, I want her

[Chorus] 
It took me 5 months (just to get to know your name) 
5 weeks (to show you I ain't playin' games) 
5 days (before you'd even let me call over to your house, baby) 
5 hours (on the phone beggin' you) 
5 minutes (now I'm here kissin' you) 
5 seconds (you got me in a shaky mood, now is the time) 
Somebody better shake it off (shake it off) 
Shake it off, shake it off, shake it off I know you wanna shake it off, shake it off 
So shake it off, shake it off 
Shake it off, shake it off, shake it off 
Oh baby please shaaaake it off 
So shake it off, shake it off

[Bridge] 
I never in my life 
Fall in love from sight 
Seeing you in sight 
A riot in my life 
Now you took control of me, oh 
Heart and soul of me 
You got a hold of me 
Now I can shake it down 
Who wants to dance right now, put ya hands up 
Come on put ya hands up, what, what, come on 
1-2-3 throw your hands up high 
4-5-6 wave from side to side, shake it off 
7-8-9 let us see you shake, come on 
10-11-12 come on let's do it again, shake it off 
Shake it off, shake it off, shake it off I know you wanna shake it off, shake it off 
So shake it off, shake it off 
Shake it off, shake it off, shake it off 
Oh baby please shaaaake it off 
So shake it off, shake it off 
Oh, oh, oh 
Shake it off
