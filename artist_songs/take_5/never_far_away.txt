[1st Verse]
Everything I do Is all done for you 
Lady I'm yours 
And everywhere I go 
You're always on my mind 
You're all I adore 
And I'll go 
Outta my way 
Just to assure 
That our love endures I'm yours

[Chorus]
Girl I'm never far away I'll be right there (right there) 
To keep you nice and warm I'm rushing right home 
Girl I'm never far away I'll be right there (right there) 
To protect you from the storm I'm rushing right home 
Girl I'll be there I'll be right there

[2nd Verse]
I don't need you say 
That I love you 
A million times a day 
Just the little things I do 
All done for you 
That's how I display 
Love 
And I'll go 
Out of my way 
Just to assure you baby 
That our love endures I'm yours

[Chorus] 
Girl I'm never far away I'll be right there (right there) 
To keep you nice and warm 
(Girl I'll keep you nice and warm, 
You know I'll keep you nice and warm 
You know I'll keep you nice and warm) 
Girl I'm never far away I'll be right there (I'll be right there) 
To protect you from the storm I'm rushing right home 
Girl I'll be there I'll be right there


[Bridge]
You don't have to go and check my pager 
Check my phone and search my pants to figure me out (ha) 
Cause I'm an honest man 
Don't need a plan, a stronger man 
Cause girl there is no doubt 
My love's real (as real as it comes) 
Even though we are a million miles away from each other 
I'm still right here, right here for you 
(Here for you, here for you) I could search a million years 
And still I wouldn't find anyone as beautiful as you 
So rest assured our love endures I'm never far away... 
(I'm rushing home baby, I'm coming home baby) I'm never far away... 
(I'm rushing home baby, home baby, home baby) I'm never far away... 
(I'm rushing home baby, I'm coming home baby) I'm never far away... 
(I'm rushing home baby, home baby, home baby) I'm never far away... 
(I'm rushing home baby, I'm coming home baby) I'm never far away... 
(I'm rushing home baby, home baby, home baby) I'm never, never, never, never far Never, never, never, never far 
Never far, never far I'm never far away I'm never far away... 
(I'm rushing home baby, I'm coming home baby) I'm never far away... 
(I'm rushing home baby, home baby, home baby) I'm never far away... 
(I'm rushing home baby, I'm coming home baby) I'm never far away... 
(I'm rushing home baby, home baby, home baby) I'm never far away... 
(I'm rushing home baby, I'm coming home baby) I'm never far away... 
(I'm rushing home baby, home baby, home baby) I'm never, never, never, never far Never, never, never, never far 
Never far, never far I'm never far away I'll be right there
