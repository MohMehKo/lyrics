You and I got so tired of getting by
Slow burn, wrong turn, never seeing eye to eye
With every word unsaid, humming in our heads
Waiting till the light turned red at

[Chorus:]
Sunrise goodbye when she goes away
She ain't coming back for awhile
I know the things I should have done

Long time, thin line, love and hate
Night walls, cracks crawling
With the memories I'll never shake

[Pre-Chorus:]
We didn't have a chance, we didn't have a dime
I waited till you crossed that line at

[Chorus]
[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
