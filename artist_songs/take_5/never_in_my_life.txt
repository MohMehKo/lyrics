[1st Verse] 
I remember how you use to touch me in the morning when I'd rise 
And how everything seemed right when I looked in your eyes 
I guess it true you never miss your water until your well runs dry 
Girl I really miss you here in my life

[Chorus] 
Baby what can I say (what can I say) 
Yes I was wrong (yes I was wrong) 
Girl I admit I was unkind 
Now what can I do (what can I do) 
Now that your gone (now that your gone) 
Baby let me back inside 
Never in my life 
Did I know a love so true 
How can I live life 
When my life begins with you 
And I'll keep searching all my life 
Until I find the perfect one It's you (it's you, it's you) 
Never in my life did I know 
Did I know a love could ever be so true 
Never in my life did I know 
Babygirl all I need is you

[2nd Verse] 
I took advantage and took you for granted baby from the very start 
And everything you gave to me came straight from your heart 
Now will we ever get back to holding hands, will I ever get another chance 
To prove to you and show you that I can be a better man

[Chorus]
Oh what can I say (what can I say) 
Guess I was wrong (guess I was wrong) 
Girl I admit I was unkind 
Now what can I do (what can I do) 
Now that your gone (now that your gone) 
Baby let me back inside 
Cause never in my life 
Did I know a love so true 
How can I live life 
When my life begins with you 
And I'll keep searching all my life 
Until I find the perfect one 
It's you (it's you, it's you)

[Bridge]
After all the dust has settled 
And everyone on earth is gone 
What will you do 
When we are standing 
Face to face, one on one 
Will you kiss me baby, love me like crazy 
Will you tell me you want me again (tell me you want me again) 
Cause I'm lost and uncertain, I'm tired of huring I just need you in my life 
Never in my life 
Never in my life 
It's you, it's you, it's you, oh-oh oh-oh 
Tell me you want me again, oh-oh oh-oh-oh 
Babygirl all I need is you, oh-oh oh-oh 
Tell me you want me again, oh-oh oh-oh-oh
