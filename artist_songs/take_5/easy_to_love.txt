[Pre-Chorus:]
You're so easy to hold
So easy to touch
And when you're not beside me
I miss you so much

[Chorus:]
Like a beautiful song
You're easy to love

You're so easy to talk to
It's so easy to see
You just captured the moonlight
And gave it to me

[Chorus]

It's easy thinking about tomorrow
As long as you're with me today
The road is sometimes hard to follow
But together we'll find a way

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

You're so easy to talk to
It's so easy to see
You just captured the moonlight
And gave it to me

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 2x]
