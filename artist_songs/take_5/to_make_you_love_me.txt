Hey 
What do I do (what do I do) 
To make you love me

[1st Verse]
I can hold you close 
Safe and warm against the dark and cold I can keep any promise 
I make I will show you more than words can say 
I could reach the moon and the stars 
And bring them down to you wherever you are 
I could fall down on my knees 
I could pray that you belong to me 
Ooh baby

[Chorus]
So what do I have to do to make you love me (baby) 
The way that I love you What do I say to make you feel (you think) 
The way I feel for you I'd give you the world 
If you would only be my girl (be my girl) 
So what do I do (what do I do) 
To make you love me

[2nd Verse]
I could kiss all of your tears away 
And make the sun appear on a cloudy day 
I could give you the things that you need 
If only you believed in me (in me)

[Chorus] 
What do I have to do to make you love me (what do I do) 
The way that I love you (oh baby) 
What do I say to make you feel (what do I say) 
The way I feel for you I'd give you the world (give you the world) 
If you would only be my girl (if you'd only be my girl) 
So what do I do (aww baby) 
To make you love me (oh yeah)

[Bridge] 
Oh I, I can't go on 
Living this way 
Loving to show my heartaches 
And why, why can't you see (why can't you see) 
Baby I will do anything to make you love me

[Chorus]
What do I have to do to make you love me (to make you love me) 
The way that I love you (the way I feel for you) 
What do I say to make you feel (what do I say) 
The way I feel for you (for you) I'd give you the world (give you the world) 
If you would only be my girl (only be my girl) 
So what do I do 
To make you love me

[Chorus]
What do I have to do to make you love me 
The way that I love you (what do I do) 
What do I say to make you feel (where do I go when your away) 
The way I feel for you I'd give you the world (give you the world) 
If you would only be my girl (only be my girl) 
So what do I do 
To make you love me

[Chorus]
What do I have to do to make you love me (aww baby) 
The way that I love you 
So what do I say to make you feel 
The way I feel for you
