The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not the kinda guy who gives up
Just like that - oh no

It's not the things you do that
Tease and hurt me bad - Who who who
But it's the way you do the things you do to me
I'm not the kinda guy who gives up just like that - oh no

[Chorus:]
The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one - number one
The tide is high but I'm movin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one - number one

Every boy wants you to be his girl
But I'll wait my dear till it's my turn
I'm not the kinda guy who gives up just like that - oh no

The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one - number one

Every boy wants you for his girl
But I'll wait my dear till it's my turn
I'm not the kinda guy who gives up just like that - oh no
