There's no excuse for what you're doing
Just standing there without a clue and you look so nice,
you caught my eye
Come out to the dance floor and tell me why
Why are you just watching me
Don't you like the funky beat
Do you care to join me
You should be getting down with me

[Chorus:]
Tell me why you're holding up that wall tonight
Don't you wanna get down (gotta get up to get down) get down tonight
The party's really pumpin' so get on your feet
Don't you wanna get down (gotta get up to get down) get down tonight

This party's pumpin' and I'm waiting for you to let down your hair and enjoy this groove
Get those hands in the air, wave 'em 'round like you don't care
Raise the roof baby, let me hear you say yeah

Why are you just watching me
Don't you like the funky beat
Do you care to join me
You should be getting down with me

[Chorus]
