[1st Verse] 
Something in the spring 
Is making me grow in love with you, babe 
Something in the summer breeze 
Is blowing me into your arms, babe 
Girl you know you got me open 
There's no time for anyone else 
You're a priceless pearl in my posession 
And you are rare 
If you ever start to wonder 
What you mean to me 
Let me sum it up in just two syllables 
Water

[Chorus] 
You are the earth beneath my feet I'm planted, baby 
You are the wind that's blowing me Into your arms 
You are the fire in my heart 
But most of all 
You are the purest element 
Water, 
Water

[2nd Verse] 
Girl, umm since I drink from your fountain I, I thirst no more, babe 
Girl, you are the virtuous woman 
That I desire 
Girl, you know you got me open 
There's no time for anyone else 
You're a priceless pearl in my posession 
And you are rare 
If you ever start to wonder 
What you mean to me 
Let me sum it in just two syllables
Water,
Water

[Chorus]
You are the earth beneath my feet I'm planted, baby 
You are the wind that's blowing me Into your arms 
You are the fire in my heart 
But most of all 
You are the purest element 
Water, 
Water

[Bridge] 
I would run to the middle of a desert 
At the speed of light 
Just to have one drop of you, babe I would run to the middle of a desert 
At the speed of light 
Just to have one drop of you, babe

[Chorus]
You are the earth beneath my feet 
Yes you are 
You are the wind that's blowing me 
Blowing me to you 
You are the fire in my heart 
You're the fire in my heart 
You are the purest element 
Heart, babe 
Girl, you're like water to me 
Girl, you're like water to me 
Girl, you're like water to me 
Girl, you're like water to me
