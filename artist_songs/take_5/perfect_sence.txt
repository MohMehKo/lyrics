uh huh, yeah, yeah, uh huh, ohhh yeah

[1st Verse] 
You like to run and I like to chill 
If I'm chillin with you girl 
Every second that I have you I know I will (huh) 
Spend it with you 
You're into movies and resturants, and that's ok 
But I spending nights with you is what I want 
Because I like it that way 
People say that it won't work 
We're not compatable 
As long as we're here on this earth 
We will be inseparable 

[Chorus]
You, me, different as night and day 
All we ever hear them say 
What seems to be totally illogical 
Makes perfect sense to me 
We might be light years apart 
Still we are tied at the heart 
It's completely and totally illogical 
But it makes perfect sense to me

[2nd Verse] 
You like to go on exotic cruises 
To carribean islands 
Sip margarita's on a beach in 
Mexico (oh oh oh) I like to go walking underneath the stars 
Moon shining down on 
You and me holding hands 
We understand we got a plan 
If that's wherever you are 
It's where I wanna go (it's where I wanna go) 
Don't you know 
They can believe what they will 
We'll prove them wrong 
Come hell or high water alone 
And still be strong

[Chorus]
You, me, different as night and day 
All we ever hear them say 
What seems to be totally illogical 
Makes perfect sense to me 
We might be light years apart 
Still we are tied at the heart It's completely and totally illogical 
But it makes perfect sense to me

[Bridge] 
I always heard that opposites attract 
You and I are living proof no matter what 
Loves survives after all 
Ooh yeah

[Chorus]
You, me, different as night and day 
All we ever hear them say 
What seems to be totally illogical 
Makes perfect sense to me 
We might be light years apart 
Still we are tied at the heart 
It's completely and totally illogical 
But it makes perfect sense to me

[Chorus]
You, me, different as night and day 
All we ever hear them say 
What seems to be totally illogical 
Makes perfect sense to me 
We might be light years apart 
Still we are tied at the heart 
It's completely and totally illogical 
But it makes perfect sense to me, yeah
