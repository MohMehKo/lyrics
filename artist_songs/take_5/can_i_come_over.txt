[1st Verse]
I know it's late but baby my love won't wait I've gotta get with you 
Got to be next to you 
Right now baby 
So don't tell me your tired I'll wake you up with sweet desire 
Talking just for you I need to see you

[Chorus]
Can I come over and hold you all through the night 
Can I come over and show you what I got on my mind 
Can we get closer and closer till I feel your heart next to mine 
Can I, can I, can I come over tonight

[2nd Verse]
We could dance slow 
To the slow songs on the radio 
We could be staying up until the sun comes up 
All night baby 
So don't tell me your tired 
Cause I can't put out this fire I don't want to sleep I want you beside me 

[Chorus] 
Can I come over and hold you all through the night 
Can I come over and show you what I got on my mind 
Can we get closer and closer till I feel your heart next to mine 
Can I, can I, can I come over tonight

[Bridge]
We can talk till the morning I can love you all night I don't care what we do 
As long as I can spend the night with you, with you

[Chorus]
Can I come over and hold you all through the night 
Can I come over and show you what I got on my mind 
Can we get closer and closer till I feel your heart next to mine 
Can I, can I, can I come over tonight 
Can I come over and hold you all through the night 
Can I come over and show you what I got on my mind 
Can we get closer and closer till I feel your heart next to mine 
Can I, can I, can I come over tonight

[Chorus] 
Can I come over and hold you all through the night 
Can I come over and show you what I got on my mind 
Can we get closer and closer till I feel your heart next to mine 
Can I, can I, can I come over tonight 
Can I come over and hold you all through the night 
Can I come over and show you what I got on my mind 
Can we get closer and closer till I feel your heart next to mine 
Can I, can I, can I
