Hey ladies 
Can you tell me where the hotties at 
Can I hear ya'll scream from front to back I like to see ya'll work it like that

Pardon me, girl I'm really shy I hope you understand

Or I will try again I know it might sound crazy I guess I'm stalkin' you 
Cause I love everything about you

[Chorus] 
You're a hottie and I'm sorry I can't help if I'm lovin' your body 
Can I chill wit'chu I'll be here for you

Ferrari You're all I want, all I dream
