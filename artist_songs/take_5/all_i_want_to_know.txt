Here lately I don't see enough of you.
I'm thinking maybe you don't love as hard as I do
Maybe I think too much, I just don't wanna lose your touch
Baby want you just humor me (all I wanna know)

[Chorus:]
Baby all I wanna know, girl tell me if it's so
Baby all I wanna know is you need me (yeah, yeah)
All I wanna know girl tell me if it's so baby all I wanna know is you need me
I don't want to suffer the pain of a broken heart
Cause I've decided I wanna be where you are (yes I do)
All I want is you to ease my mind, say everything is just fine,
your love is mine all mine

[Chorus 2x]

[Dance Break Down]

[Chorus Out]
