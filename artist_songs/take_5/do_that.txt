[1st Verse]
Something about the way you strut your stuff 
Makes me wonder how it feels to be with you 
Girl I wanna touch you 
Something about your eyes that speak to me 
If anyone awakes the freak in me, you do 
Girl I wanna freak you 
And from over here girl, I still feel your vibe 
And you're makin' my body feel so alive 
And I can't wait til I get you in my ride 
Can we get it on (can we get it on) 
Oh oh

[Chorus]
I can see you really wanna play 
There's no reason why we gotta stay 
Baby swing my way 
Do that, do that 
Tell your friends that we gotta go 
Where we're goin' they don't have to know 
Baby swing my way 
Do that, do that, do that

[2nd Verse]
I'll make ya wanna do things 
Try new things 
That you never did before 
We could take it to the movies, the jacuzzi 
Girl I'm always good to go 
The way your shakin' your body 
Girl you got me 
So come on and start the show 
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, ohh
And from over here girl, I still feel your vibe (still feel your vibe) 
And your making my body feel so alive (feel so alive) 
And I can't wait til I get you in my ride 
Can we get it on (can we get it on, get it on, can we get it on)

[Chorus] 
I can see you really wanna play 
There's no reason why we gotta stay 
Baby swing my way 
Do that, do that
Tell your friends that we gotta go 
Where we're goin' they don't have to know 
Baby swing my way 
Do that, do that, do that 
Do that, do that, girl I hope you wanna do that 
Do that, do that, cause I really wanna do that 
Do that, do that, girl I hope you wanna do that 
Do that, do that (do that, you got to do that)

There's no reason why we gotta stay 
Baby swing my way
