Ohhhh alright baby 

[1st Verse]
There's something special about you 
Could it be a spell you put on me that got me lovin' you 
In the middle of the night baby I wake up to, to a cold sweat (yeah) 
Cause I'm thinking 'bout you 
It seems to me like it's make believe
A dream girl like you wanting to be with me 
So I pinched myself, to see if you'd fade away 
Never went away, so I said to myself

[Chorus] 
If I would've known then what I know now 
I would've saved my love for you (only you) 
But since I didn't know then what I know now 
There's one thing that I know I'm glad I saved the best for last 
Ohhhh ohhh oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[2nd Verse] 
I always think about me and you 
And shed a tear for every year me and you should have been 
I'm gonna always tell you how I feel 
Cause momma told me never let your silence speak for you 
It seems to me like it's make believe 
A dream girl like you wanting to be with me 
So I pinched myself, to see if you'd fade away 
Never went away, so I said to myself

[Chorus] 
If I would've known then (ohh ohh) what I know now 
I would've saved my love for you, only you (only you) 
But since I didn't know then (know then) what I know now 
There's one thing that I know I'm glad I saved the best for last

[Bridge] 
All the pain, I've experienced 
Bad relationships could've been avoided 
If I only knew that you were out there I would've saved all of my love for you 
If I only knew

[Chorus] 
If I would've known then what I know now 
I would've saved my love for you (all my love), only you (only you) 
But since I didn't know then (know then) what I know now 
There's one thing that I know I'm glad I saved the best for last 
If I would've known then what I know now 
I would've saved my love for you, only you (only you) 
But since I didn't know then (know then) what I know now 
There's one thing that I know I'm glad I saved the best for last 
I'm glad saved the best for last I'm glad I saved the best for last 
I'm glad I saved the best for last So glad I saved the best for last
You're the best 
You're different from all the rest
