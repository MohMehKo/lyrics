The trouble with my heart is it always goes astray
I guess that's the reason why you're leaving me this way
Before you leave my love, there's something I must say
If you leave, you'll turn my blue skies to grey
Please stay

Sometimes when you're not here I squeeze my pillow tight
I need to have you somewhere near to make it turn out right
So I'll beg you girl - stay just one more night
If you stay, you'll turn my wrong ways to right
Please stay tonight

Oh baby stay just one more night [4x]

Before you leave my love there's something I must say
If you leave, you'll turn my blue skies to grey
Please stay

Oh baby stay just one more night [4x]
Stay I just can't live without you [4x]
Living alone I just can't stand to be all alone [2x]
Living without you I know that I can't be alone [2x]
Stay in my corner
