Yeah we were running and how we were running
Across the hills in the pop art blue
Buzzards fly above the car
Circling us as if they knew
If I falter, If I falter
Darling will you reel me in?
If I lose it, If I lose it
Will you remind where we've been?

So we were climbing and how we were climbing
The cartoon trees up to the sky
As the sun dropped off the page
Gold it flew into my eye

Well it's all up from here.
It's like I can taste opportunity near.
I cut myself on barbed wire, getting wood for the fire
I was too. busy staring at you...
You...

So then we were floating up, we were floating like particles into the night
High above the factories
We hitched a lift on a satellite
Lover, will you spin me round?
May we never fall back to ground

Well it's all up from here
It's like I can taste opportunity near
I cut myself on barbed wire
Getting wood for the fire
I was too. Busy staring at you...

Well it's all up from here
It's like I can taste opportunity near
I cut myself on barbed wire
Getting wood for the fire
I was too. Busy staring at you...
I was too. Busy staring at you...(Falling into) (Getting wood for the fire)
I was too. Busy staring at you...(Into your eyes) (Getting wood for the fire)
I was too. Busy staring at you...(Falling into) (Getting wood for the fire)
I was too. Busy staring at you...(Into your eyes) (Getting wood for the fire)
You... (Falling in to)
(Into your eyes)

(Into your eyes)
(Getting wood for the fire)
(Getting wood for the fire)
(Falling into)
(Into your eyes)
(Falling into)
(Into your eyes)
