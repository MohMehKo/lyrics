Oh, dawn broke
Heavy rains made it hard to load
Is it time for the road?
I don't know, don't know

Father has gone
So let's go hold your baby's head
And I won't let go
Of your hand, child of mine
(Child of mine)

When it's time to let go
Then we'll be up in heaven's ground
Every dream that I dream
Let you have more than mine

Spirits will climb
Into a time of your design
All that I know
Never will be told, oh, child of mine

After the flight
Dead of the night, oh, we'll be peaceful
Sweet laughter calls
All of a sudden, no time for waiting

So I'm off on the road
That I see might be coming
And those dreams that I hold
All for this child of mine

All that I know
Never will it show, sweet child of mine
All that I know
Never will be told, oh, child of mine

Sweet child of mine
Oh, child
