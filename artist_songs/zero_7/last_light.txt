Tunnels down, corridors
Sound of joy, breathe in
Bridges to nowhere
Sound of love leaving

Last light, first fall
To be born, to die alone

Earthquakes, hurricane
White doves flying
Old feels, you're home
To know what matters most
Yeah I'll keep you safe and sound
I'll keep you safe and sound
Keep you safe and sound
Safe and sound
Keep you safe and sound
Safe and sound
