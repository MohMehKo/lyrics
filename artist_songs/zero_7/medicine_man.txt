Keep on, keep it up
Keep on, keep it up
Keep on, keep it up
Keep on, keep it up

Keep on, keep it up
Keep on, keep it up
Keep on, keep it up
Keep on, keep it up

Underrated, overrated up and down in here
I always thought I was the one who got to run the bill
Can't seem to keep it off of my mind
Losing my grip because I think about it all the time

Making up the stories is the type of thing that you do
Outrageous, simply outrageous
Forget about your merits or the methods that you're used to
Outrageous, simply outrageous

Fixing up the potions like a medicine man
Stirring my emotions 'cause I know, well you know you can
Leave me open halfway, maybe heal myself
You just seem to keep it on, keep it up

Keep on, keep it up
Keep on, keep it up
Keep on, keep it up
Keep on, keep it up

Keep on, keep it up
Keep on, keep it up
Keep on, keep it up
Keep on, keep it up

I must admit that I've been up and down just like a yo-yo
A roller coaster, up and over, where the heck did I go?
Feels like you're goin' under my skin
Been so long, couldn't remember how it all began

Making up the stories is the type of thing that you do
Outrageous, simply outrageous
Forget about your merits or the methods that you're used to
Contagious, simply outrageous

Fixing up the potions like a medicine man
Stirring my emotions 'cause you know, well I know you can
Maybe open halfway, baby heal myself
Keep on, keep it up

Forget about it, forget about it, the medicine you're used to
Fixing up the potions, that's your miracle, baby
Stirring my emotions 'cause I know that you know you can
Leave me hoping halfway baby, heal myself

Keep on, keep it up
Keep on, keep it up
Keep on, keep it up
Keep on, keep it up

Keep on, keep it up
Keep on, keep it up
Keep on, keep it up
Keep on, keep it up

I'm onto your plan Mr. Medicine Man
