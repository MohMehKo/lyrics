Faith sealer
I don't feel you
Don't hear you speak

Maybe
Someone else will
Help you to see

Warm sounds
Falling slowly
Takes the time away from me
Warm sounds
Feeling no pain
Taking the time away from me

Fake feeler
I see through you
With my eyes closed

Warm sounds
Falling slowly
Takes the time away from me
Warm sounds
Feeling no pain
Taking the time away from me

They can't tell me
What they can't see
How it feels here
Just how it feels here
Just how it feels here ...
