Hey! Ho! How ya' been?
Got my second wind,
I see, what they're in,
Hello, hey out there,
Be sure, what you hear,
Check your eyes,
Check your ears,
TV will disguise,
Radio never lies,

Whoa whoa
I won't sleep, k-keep the radio on,
I won't sleep, k-keep the radio on,
I've seen the audio/visual tryin' to make up my mind for me
I won't sleep, I keep the radio on
Givin' me somethin' so familiar wanna turn off the light, alright?
I won't sleep, k-keep the radio on,
Will you be my friend until the middle of night?
I won't sleep, k-keep the radio on,

Heard it goes, in the night, but I know, deep inside,
I'm painting pictures in my mind

Radio on, the radio of the radio on
Radio on, the radio of the radio on

Radio on, the radio of, the radio on
Radio on, the radio of, the radio on
Keep the radio on, keep the stereo on, keep the radio on

I won't sleep I k-keep the radio on
I won't sleep I k-keep the radio on
I won't sleep I k-keep the radio on
Will you be my friend until the middle of the night?
Heard it goes, in the night, but I know, deep inside,
I'm paintin' pictures in my mind

Oh ho hoh oh hoh oh
