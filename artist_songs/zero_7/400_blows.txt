Hiding from finding your long [?]
You wither [?] to the colour of your [?]
And I felt every blow
Felt every blow

It's not a way to take away your pain
It's not a way to take away what is hard
And you still won't leave me in peace
And you still won't leave me in peace

And you still won't leave me in peace

The thickest stitch to our soul
Living with this will wither us both
And I felt every blow
Felt every blow

It's not a way to take away your pain
It's not a way to take away what is hard
And you still won't leave me in peace
And you still won't leave me in peace

And you still won't leave me in peace
And you still won't leave me in peace
And you still won't leave me in peace
And you still won't leave me in peace
