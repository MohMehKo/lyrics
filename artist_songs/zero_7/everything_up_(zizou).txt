Mauritania to Willesden Green
The truth is faster than a laser beam
Cross a table in the seven seas
It's coloring, coloring everything
With a mirror and a steady hand
We can remedy your broken band
Turn it round like Zinedine Zidane
Yes we can, imagine it if you can

Spot the difference if you can, come on
Catch a fire inside your hand
It's burning deep like moodyman
101, oh, 101, come on
Murakami would have told you so
If you catch him will you let me know
Bobbing apples in the studio
Pack it up, Ikiti do-si-do

Bateese in full swing
Turn up everything
Cross a table in the seven seas
It's coming faster than a laser beam
Spot the difference if you can
It's coloring, coloring everything
Turn it round if you can
Yes we can, imagine it if we can
Yes we can, imagine it if we can
Turn it round like Zinedine Zidane
Yes we can, imagine it if we can

Yes we can, imagine it if we can
Yes we can, imagine it if we can
Yes we can, imagine it if we can
