[Verse 1 - Jadakiss]

Uh, I learnt the game, I know what I want and I'm in it,
The time is now, it's gonna be up in a minute,
You look a ***** in the eye, you could tell if he tinted,
These fake rappers gettin by with these hell of a gimmicks,
They act like it's all love, only love is your money,
so when it's over *****, are you a thug or a dummy,
I'm neither, but I been hot so long, it feels like I got a lifetime fever,
and I ain't gotta spit, I could cough and still eat ya,
and f*** rap I make mills of reefer,
I'm a man first, tired of punchin *****z, so I'ma shoot *****z cuz my hands hurt,
and God is great, guard ya space,
one hand wash the other, both wash the face,
and I head crack so much, it's hard to ace,
.38 revolver flow, its hard to trace, what!

[Chorus - Styles P (Jadakiss)]

f*** that, pop off till nothin in the clip left (pop off)
till nobody in his clique left (nobody)
hole in the head, slashed or the split chest 
if they asked what happened (tell em it's the Kiss Of Death)
Hustle hard till none of them bricks left (nothin left),
stick it up till not a crumb on the strip left (take that, take that)
Make sure aint a chain or a chip left (uh uh)
If they asked what happened (tell em' its the Kiss Of Death)
Tell em Kiss (THE KISS OF DEATH!)

[Verse 2 - Jadakiss]

This is LOXville, and even white America'll let y'all negros know Jada got skill
You a jackass like Johnny Knoxville,
so I can jus imagine how ya pops feel (damn!)
and you aint worth my shells, so you should just imagine how the Ak feel,
a lotta *****z is thousandnaires, walkin round town, frontin like they got millz
for what it's worth, I'm one myself, but my strength in the hood outruns my wealth
but you still might catch Kiss in some hot wheels, New Bently coupe, with the stock wheels,
Haha, look how I get back to it, I send my young *****z to do it, in the black Buick,
I don't spit bars, I distribute the crack fluid,
all I'm really waitin on is for *****z to act stupid

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Jadakiss]

To all my real *****z, sorry for keepin you waitin,
it's ironic, but the god was beefin with satan,
I love y'all tho, my *****z for even relatin,
this ain't Kiss talkin neither, I'm speakin for Jason,
when you a problem it's harder to keep them from hatin,
*****z jaws, is like laws, don't easy to break em,
if I wasn't on some s***, I'm gettin on it, come to me with ya hand out to me, I'm spittin on it,
I don't wanna hear what happened, matter of fact, I don't even care what happened,
Might as well declare the clappin, cuz my bones is old,
gotta lotta wear and tear from scrappin,
Hate a ***** that, ain't never there to see s***, but always hear what happened,
The thing better than money, is respect,
no love this time, *****, Kiss Of Death, what!

[Chorus]
