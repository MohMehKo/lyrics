[Kanye West]
[Chorus]
Shorty getting it in with me
Shorty getting it in with me
She said I brought some friends with me 
But I don’t know why because they aint getting it in with me
Shorty getting it in with me
Shorty getting it in with me
She said I brought some friends with me 
But I don’t know why because they aint getting it in with me

[Verse 1]
You know me im with a ghetto diva
Stiletto fever, jello shots, yellow reefer
Same rules apply, im back on top
You cant drink or smoke if you not gon pop
See me in the popcorn drop, not gon stop
Taking shots of Petrone, getting top on yachts
From a island to the mountain, rock on rocks
The whole world wanna know, when this lock go drop
Without a doubt, she acknowledge the wealth
Since she aint give brains, I told her let me get some knowledge myself
Then I told her, be proud of yourself, and dig deep
Im trying to see what you can get out of yourself
After all that, I told her to fall back
The Ferrari truck parked in the back, its all black
Next time, bring some friends and more yak
It depends how I feel in the morn’ if I call back

[Kanye West]
[Chorus]
Shorty getting it in with me
Shorty getting it in with me
She said I brought some friends with me 
But I don’t know why because they aint getting it in with me
Shorty getting it in with me
Shorty getting it in with me
She said I brought some friends with me 
But I don’t know why because they aint getting it in with me

[Kanye West]
[Verse 2]
Kanye Chedda
Im with this bad Ethiopian chick drinking straight up liquor
I told her im Nigerian straight up nigga
Now is it just me or do them Ug’s, have girls feet looking like sheepskin rugs
Some rhyme witta name, some rhyme nameless
Don’t try to treat me like I aint famous
My apologies are you into astrology
Cause, um, im trying to make it to Uranus
See, that’s a little Don Juan game
All across your chest like Sean John name
Niggas trynna figure out since Kan came
Who the rookie of the year, me or Lebron James
They say whoa don’t get caught up in the hype
Aint no telling if they gon love you after tonight
Well if tonights the night, pop bottles, fuck models
Spend money till your broke, my nigga live your life

[Kanye West]
[Chorus]
Shorty getting it in with me
Shorty getting it in with me
She said I brought some friends with me 
But I don’t know why because they aint getting it in with me
Shorty getting it in with me
Shorty getting it in with me
She said I brought some friends with me 
But I don’t know why because they aint getting it in with me

[Jadakiss]
[Verse 3]
Shorty getting it in with me, 600 Benz with me
She wanna spend with me
She see me roll up the bud, and thug up the club
Cause I got my mens with me
She say she leaving her friends for me
They aint getting in with her, cause she gon bend for me
Her tongue spin like a rim for me, do what she can for me
Look like a 10 for me
Now shorty is out with me, using her mouth with me
She looking out for me
She say Kiss where you live
I said, you see the bridge when you step on the balcony
Lets go

[Kanye West]
[Chorus]
Shorty getting it in with me
Shorty getting it in with me
She said I brought some friends with me 
But I don’t know why because they aint getting it in with me
Shorty getting it in with me
Shorty getting it in with me
She said I brought some friends with me 
But I don’t know why because they aint getting it in with me
