I hopped in the cutlass
I hopped out a bucket
I pop like I pulled out my weight in some luggage
These hoes steady buggin'
My phone steady buzzin'
I think it’s the plug finna drop off a dozen
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
I hopped in the cutlass
I hopped out a bucket
I pop like I pulled out my weight in some luggage
These hoes steady buggin'
My phone steady buzzin'
I think it’s the plug finna drop off a dozen
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing

[Jadakiss:]
Right off the back all these niggas be fronting
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
Get that gut feeling you know that they coming
You ain't got no paper ain't even worth running
Hoped out the cutlass and hopped in the bucket
Run in your mouth you’ll get popped in your nugget
You had the ball then you dropped it then fuck it
I open up shop on the block and I crush it
Don’t let yourself be the next kiss opponent
No I ain't driving but yeah bitch I own it
Usually niggas get caught in the moment
I showed them a style and they just went and cloned it
Whole ones half ones even zips moving
We ain't even gonna talk about the bricks moving
Rock a gold sky dweller and a thick Cuban
Gave away more hits than Rick Rubin
Hard times come you just gotta get through em
These lil niggas got a lotta shit brewing
Feds get involved then alotta shit ruined
Used to spit at niggas now I spit through em
I don’t wash clothes nigga I just get new ones
Real boss niggas it be hard to get to em
Yeah real low on the suckers
I walked out the trap house and hopped in the cutlass

[Exodus:]
Where I’m from ain't nothing but survival
Before niggas pray the gonna pick up that rifle
Before niggas sleep they gonna camp out and snipe you
Wipe you off the face of the earth your face on a shirt
Ive been through in that phantom fly back to the place that I'm from
But no happy with that they took my brother the government kidnap and shit
I ain't just talking I ain't just rapping said it really happened
That’s why I get on shit that you with and I vomit
I don’t give a fuck you know how extra its comin
Itd beef I'm at you and I might be atacha woman
I make it look like you put time in for nothing
Dont make no sudden moves around me I’m clutching
These niggas had to see the money I’m touching
My niggas put there hands on cars and I'm pushing
But I ain't jumping for a nigga
