[Hook:]
I'm on a paper chase they want me outta my zone
Spread the product get the profit I'm gone
Yea high as fuck driving alone
Spread the product get the profit I'm gone
Sometimes I can feel the hate when its nearest
I can see it clearer than the man in the mirror
Feeling down and I'm telling myself cheer up
I'm only scared of god and the man in the mirror

Ya destiny’s in yo hand inner strength a Conan
Too much time in the hood will have u programmed
Or in ya cell writing a kite listening to slow jams
The 2-3 ain't workin' on me they gotta go man
I got the ball movin’ I rock a small Cuban
I'm too famous to deny some of my wrong doing
Its never about what you’ve done what you can do for them
Family and friends I be done rapidly losing them
Look at they name think about it before deleting it
Before you sit down at the table watch who you eating wit
Hopefully those ain't the people you competing wit
Too focused to quit my journey before completing it

It’s a difference between what you doin' and what you tryna do
Price u pay for not being humble is astronomical
Especially in the jungle what would a lions do
If you can do the math on that then do the science too
Move around wit the 4lb or a 9 or two
Hometown hate I receive ain't worth responding to
I'm the one that made them believe in a Yonkers dude
Even though they hated on me I'm responsible
First they gonna try divide then they conquer you
Try to make u swallow ya pride cause they sponsored you
Yea I only fear two beings, one I can talk to
The other I can see him

684, peddle to the floor
Blunt to the face ready for the war
You already know something heavy in the door
Any kind of funny movement I'm letting off
Life is the one thing you can't get a pair of
While I'm here I'm make my surrounding I'm aware of
Made enough money kids taken care of
I'm only scared of god and the man in the mirror
