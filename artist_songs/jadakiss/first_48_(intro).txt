Right now I just wanna say thank you, (thank you)
For your downloads, ya streams, ya hard copies
Whatever means of purchase
Even if you bootlegged this joint I appreciate you
We 4 projects in, a whole lot more to go
Thanks to all the support for riding out wit ya nigga
Despite what you may think or what you may have heard
I am… Top 5 dead or alive

Everything is real ain't nothing cozy
Fresher than a young nigga mind of a OG
Inhale exhale yea cherish every breath
Shinin’ like I just came home but I never left
Most of them is lovin’ me some of them hatin’ me
Say hes underrated dependin’ on whose ratin’ me
I be destroyin' niggas on tracks blatantly
Basically I'm patiently waitin’ for a vacancy
It ain't hard to tell they all scared to challenge ’em
Money power respect I learned how to balance them
Water melon over the pump the hood silencer
Couple hundred thousand a month is a good calendar
Yea they love to hear the don speak
That's because my dialog ain't in arms reach
Nah I ain't wit the coward ish
First the skinny jeans now they wearin’ blouses
Don't ever confuse wireless for powerless
A nice red wine haze and a sour mix
I'm in the trap wit the blicky
Cigarettes pills and the sticky
If u need somethin hit me
When it s poppin I breeze quickly
To ya door step if ya coppin at least 50
Never mix my feelings wit my dealings
I'm house shoppin’ for wood floors high ceilings
200 or more on the dash if I'm wheelin’
Really these just niggas is mad cause I'm chillin’
Face on the masters mother pearls
I maintain cause I dominated the underworld
If you sick to ya stomach that mean u wanna earl
The moon and the stars tell u son is through
I'm gettin’ better every week
And I don't talk to much the longivty will speak
They ain't selling u nothing u think its better cause its cheap
Wit the push of a button ill get u wet up in the street
Its never been even I'm one of the best breathin’
Ya red shirts might be ready by next season
Ya spread to high is nothing I just tease em
More celebratin’ this year and less grieving
But I'm always down for a funeral
For a nigga hatin while I'm tryna get my numerals
Screw faces side glances
6 shooter headshots 5 chances
25 large or 5 dances
As u can see I'm fascinated wit the finances
Nah he don't play and hell forever be top 5 DOA nigga!
