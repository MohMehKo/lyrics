[Intro]
Ah-ha!

[Chorus x2 - Jadakiss]
(Wow) What you so mad at now?
Go get yourself a drink lets all get down
Roll somethin, smoke somethin lets blow this pound
Naw somethin jump off we gonna hold us down

[Verse 1 - Jadakiss]
Uh me n honey on the dance floor just flexin
Till the neck on my white T start stretchin
Liquor comin outta our paws and we sweatin
But that aint slowin us down, we still steppin
Her gear is strong, her hair is long, her feet is small
And she smoke weed and all, so we gonna pop us a bottle
And blow a good splif, VIP is crowded but they all look stiff
I'm well connected, I got wolves over there, and *****z that
Act like pitbulls over here, ya I'm just doin my 1 2 and shit
She's shakin it, doin that Saint Louis shit with her back in it
So I put my bones in it, the rollz go prezzy, got the pink stones in it
Why you want drama with me, I aint gonna blast you
Before I put the money on ya head I'ma ask you *****

[Chorus x2 - Jadakiss]
(Wow) What you so mad at now?
Go get yourself a drink lets all get down
Roll somethin, smoke somethin lets blow this pound
Naw somethin jump off we gonna hold us down

[Verse 2 - Jadakiss]
Yo yo yo, I'm everything controversal, underground gangsta rap
Slash commercial ya but still all it takes is a long dutch
For me to get your wifey up out of a Von Dutch
As far as the funeral, you got it, its on us cuz *****z aint crazy
They just armed us uh, so let me get another round
Now Hypno and Clico will sit a brother down
Haze'll have you feelin like you in another town
Then its time for the gangstas so get the rubbers now
K I two of them swirled things one more drink and ya boy
Might be doin the earl thing, ma its me, you and whoever ya girl bring
Meet me in the back, I'm outside the pearl thing
I got the trate pound hooked on my waist
When they mention my name around other rappers, look in they face and say

[Chorus x2 - Jadakiss]
(Wow) What you so mad at now?
Go get yourself a drink lets all get down
Roll somethin, smoke somethin lets blow this pound
Naw somethin jump off we gonna hold us down

[Verse 3 - Jadakiss]
Can't knock a ***** that didnt make it, if you try
Far as me though, my spot is celitified so when I hit my number
I'ma hit it high and when I'm dead and gone, they gonna say I did it live
Cuz I done been too nice for way to long, they cant hold me back I'm way to strong
Double R D-Block that's what it is and that's what its gonna be
We gettin it on I just wanna know

[Outro x2]
What you so mad at now
Let's all get down
Let's blow this pound
We gon' hold it down
