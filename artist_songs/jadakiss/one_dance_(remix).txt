[Jadakiss, Nino Man & Kyla:]
Yo they should've called me to do this part right here
Baby, I like your style
All I need is one more dance
Nino-Man
She ain't ready for what I'm about to hit her

[Jadakiss:]
Eye contact, I just had a glance with her
If I dance with her then I got a chance with her
Looking in the eye while I'm holding hands with her
I get anything I want so I said I can't get her
Throwing shots back, she don't want to stop that
But she singing all the words, she know where the drops at
Now we so close that we damn near kissing
But we just dancing, I'm spining and dipping her

[Nino-Man:]
Four litre spot, I need one more dance
Hoping it'll turn into a one night stand
So many bottles she like this nigga
I said nah man, sell drugs, just grand"
But if you down I put you in an uber
All these margaritas make a nigga wanna do ya
I shine like jewelers, get spread like rumors
The Nino Man cat on his feat like

[Drake:]
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time

That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

[Wizkid:]
Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Wine it, wine it, very long time
Oh yeah, very long time
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Oh yeah, very long time
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl

[Kyla & Wizkid:]
Tell me
I need to know, where do you wanna go?
Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control
Where, where, where
Where, where, where, where
Oh yeah, very long time
Where, where, where
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl
Where, where, where, where
Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
