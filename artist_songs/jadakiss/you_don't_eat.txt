Waited for luck it never landed (Nah)
Stuck on your block forever stranded (Yea)
I live by the 10 crack commandments
Either you earn respect or you demand it
It’s the liquors vs the reefers
It’s the angel versus the reaper
You might not know but it gets deeper
You heard my name on the last verse of Ether
You gotta come to the hood if you want to reach us
I’ll lay you down in the earth right underneath us
Same town used to pull parts
Cause the beggers will disappear when the war starts
I’m still out here dog I got war scars
You know me I’m from the bottom where the floor starts
When you street smart money your report card
I got the deck now I can pull a boss card (Top 5)

By any means whatever it takes
More or less life or death whatever the case
It's all about your stamina it's never the race
Re the bank back up if you ever ace
Hate so official they try fending you
When you die they don’t miss you they just remember you
I sat down with the devil and did an interview
I shot rounds with the rebels I’m with the criminals
I put an end to you I save all the small talk for the interludes
I ain't finna lose I’m in a winning mood
I’m with the winning dudes we good in every hood
My niggas been approved
Too much air nigga they gonna pop your inner tube
The works A1 yea nigga and it moves
40s of coke in the sports bar
I’m still shining like the north star
You just another nigga lost pa
I got the deck now I can pull a boss card (Top 5)
