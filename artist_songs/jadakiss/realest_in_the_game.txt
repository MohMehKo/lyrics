[Yung Buck:]
Dope boy really touched the work
I push pounds of purp a nigga been a leader
My auntie running out of dog food she put cocaine in a syringe needle
You ain't never been to the pen either
You ain't even came around here to spend either
Nigga ain't sparing no friend either
Nigga roll with you then leave you
I'm serving my neighbor I’m getting the paper
We all strapped we like a small Al Qaeda
I'm telling my niggas lets get rich fuck this shit we can fall out later
Roll up I got 5 new flavors 12 new gauges and 9 new haters
Gotta watch these bands before this little white man
Try to come and find out who paid us
What you know about the cartel boss looking at you saying
Damn you know what you made us
And you talking about fucking with these rap shit
Nah nigga you must be crazy
36 ounces you must’ve been waiting
I blew up though from what you gave me
I grew up though you know who raised me
Where’s your account you must didn’t save me

[Sheek Louch:]
Fuck what they be yellin
Niggas rap about guns and street life, them niggas be tellin
They don't know about real
They ain't never been broke, mob nothin they ain't ever been jail
They don't know about beef going back and forth
Late night on the block till the Mac go off
Nigga just came home and he back up north
Everybody where you from know your block is soft
Hold up
Lemme throw my cup
Let's toast to them boys, they ain't ever broke up
And we battled everybody and never choked up
All we do is get money and stay smoked up(Light up some)
I done [?]
I poke one of you niggas with that industry talk
We the realest everywhere, not just New York
Been eating worldwide you see my fork
What you know about me
Street nigga half the shit i can't IG
Hope the cops can't ID
Things my son can not see
Let the Trey Pound go
Light up, Let the whole pound go
I'm lit you should see my show
Real nigga just to let ya'll know

[Jadakiss:]
More money same nigga
Better frame same picture
Feds is watching why they ain't get ya
They ain't ya nigga they ain't with ya
You don’t see em and they say they miss you
All the bad luck and hate they wished you
You and your homie different casket same pastor same scripture
I’m in the hood where the drugs is never that far away from where the plug is
Homemade corn liquor in the tub is
Down bottom to its hot where the bugs is
Object is to rise up above this
Why you think all the real niggas love kiss
Cause the gram got people so caught up with likes they forgot what real love is
Right off the back of them 18 wheelers
As soon as I get it it goes to the dealers
They been fucking with us I know that they feel us
Ain't too much to say cause they know we the realest
