[Anthony:] Anthony Dongue here with the legendary, not Steven A. Smith, not Larry King, not Oprah, has this exclusive interview I'm about to conduct. Why now? You've been in the game almost 20 years and now you wanna split apart, why?

[Cornellius:] First of all I wanna let ya'll know, my name is Cornellius Williams and unfortunately I gotta go solo. I don't even get the credit I deserve, if it wasn't for me he wouldn't even have the success he has now

[Anthony:] Why do you feel you don't get the credit you deserve?

[Cornellius:] I ain't even got no ice, I got no jewelry, no silver, no nothin'. I don't have [?], I don't fuckin', I don't have a chain

[Anthony:] Tell me why they don't wanna hear him though

[Cornellius:] Cause he gettin' old, see me, my age is timeless. I don't have no age

Anthony - He looks good though, he's juicin', he's workin' out

[Cornellius:] He's got me eatin' lettuce
