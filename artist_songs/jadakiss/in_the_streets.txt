[Chorus:]
I'm in the streets getting money [x3]
I'm in these streets, Hustlin every day
I'm in the streets getting money [x3]

Yo, I'm on the block faithfully, got it so good if I'm late then wait for me.
Mama please pray for me. The devil does things in the worst ways,
In the ER waiting to hear what the nurse say.
I had payed more for funerals then birthdays, finish a whole one in a half by thursday.
(Word) So just imagine what I'm sittin with, and I ain't splittin it, I'm out here gettin it. 

[Chorus:]
I'm in these streets, I cant get away
I'm in the streets getting money [x3]
I'm in these streets, Hustlin every day
I'm in the streets getting money [x3]

Organization is smooth and ran with a tight lip,
get rid of the work and hold the bread with a tight grip.
Trust fund baby in a cut with a white chick.
Was in a choke hold, now its in a vice script.
And even though my arm still strong with the dices, drug dealer, I don't do jooks or hices.
The fame is alright but the game is priceless, my heart beating but I'm still out here lifeless. 

[Chorus:]
I'm in these streets, I cant get away
I'm in the streets getting money [x3]
I'm in these streets, Hustlin every day
I'm in the streets getting money [x3]

Start off with a wish if you wanna grant shit, I was never a worker, I always ran shit.
(True) They was doin shelves, I did the stand smiths.
My hair used to be nappier than Durant's shit.
Where they got the work at? How much the grams is,
Build it up to a key that's what the plan is.
You ain't got no fam just you and your manses, out here taking penitentiary chances.

[Chorus:]
I'm in these streets, I cant get away
I'm in the streets getting money [x3]
I'm in these streets, Hustlin every day
I'm in the streets getting money [x3]
I'm in these streets, I cant get away
I'm in these streets, Hustlin every day
