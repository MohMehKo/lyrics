[Verse 1:]
Mhmm, yes, I does that.
Stays hot, I ain't got to get my buzz back
What everybody trying to be now; I was that
They could never stop me; that's why I love rap
Been living the life, praising ice.
Bang the baddest chicks in the world, maybe twice
The swag, the gear, the bread, all the whips is a year ahead
I only fear the FEDs
Forty-five on the other side of the peep hole
Head shot from point blank; call it a free throw
Funny, 'cause I had divisions since Calico
Back then, I still ain't reached my peak, though
Louie loafers, Pollo pea coat
Call me whenever the bosses meet, yo
I drove papi crazy, so the industries never gonna stop me, baby

[Verse 2:]
I'm gonna call it confidence, 'cause I ain't cocky
I just know one thing: They can't stop me
Whether I'm on "Ef" or LA, or they swap me;
it's all good, because I know the gangsters got me
First thing's first "they jar us" abruptly
I treat the rap game like a large monopoly
One on one they can't guard me properly
But when they double team me the odds are sloppy
I move like them eighty milligrams of oxy
Send your sister back to your family knockneed
Got too hot for the grams, and got weed
In the rap bracket he remains the top seed
Revolver holds six; quick to blow three
Audio heroin, so you don't OD
Shooters know you, but you don't know me
The block is crazy, can't stop me, baby

[Verse 3:]
Once I start I ain't gonna stop the squeezing
And the gauze ain't gon' be able to stop the bleeding
And your girl ain't gon' be able to stop the weezing
When she get that phone call from the doc; we even
You could not stop me, so stop believing
Ring tone rap, this is not the season
I punch lines hard enough to stop your breathing
And the ladies will still pay a lot to see him
I'm gonna get rich long as I got my freedom
And usually when you get hit it's for a reason
If you in the hood, better dodge the Ds, and
watch your Qs, and be on your Ps, and
Thank you all for coming out this evening
Having a good time with your liquor, and treason
Even if they knock me, then continue to watch me
They still wouldn't be able to stop me
