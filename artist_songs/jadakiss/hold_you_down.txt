I love you, muah
Ah, yeah, yo, lot of square feet chopping speed is the minimum
Talk all subliminal in love with a criminal
It's all coming back to the pot no chemicals
She can get hired on the spot no interviews
No carbs, just vitamins, mineral
Riding shotgun in the coop with the general
You go hard for the kid so I'm into you
Yeah, hold you down, that's what I'm fina do

No girls are right, like you do for me baby
That's why I hold you down, that's why I hold you down
Girls don't decide and got I need baby, that's why I hold you down
That's why I hold you down

Yo, cash coming rapidly, chicks coming after me
Here cause I wanna be not cause I have to be
You the one I wanna be with ma actually
I knew you were special cause we hit it off naturally
Had your guards up at first now you're attached to me
Gotta give you all of me, can't give you half of me
You can take your time girl, we gonna move carefully
Hot bath water, the meals you prepare for me
When nobody else was, you were always there for me
And I love myself just need you to care for me
You got more than enough, I owe you now
So it's only right that I hold you down

No girls are right, like you do for me baby
That's why I hold you down, that's why I hold you down
No girls on the side, I got what I need baby, that's why I hold you down
That's why I hold you down

I'll be damned if I let this one get away
She's what I'm wanting, ain't no comparing to you girl
I'm never breakin your heart, concealing games, no need for looking
Cause there none that hurt you girl

Hey girl, it's lame trying to play with you, I'm trying to stay with you
Nah mean? spend forever and a day with you
Never mind them side chicks and they issues
It ain't nothing but bad luck that they wish you
It ain't about them knowing, it's bout the 2 of us
They can't stand to see us doing us
And I told you this is what I go through
But words can't explain it so that's why now I gotta hold you

No girls are right, like you do for me baby
That's why I hold you down, that's why I hold you down
Girls don't decide and got I need baby, that's why I hold you down
That's why I hold you down
You in good hands, we gonna be high, haha, I love you, muah
