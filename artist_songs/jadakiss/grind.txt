[Intro]
Look here, stay on your grind
Everyday is a struggle, we all hustle and we grind

[Verse 1]
Do your history and find out Kiss’ll be the last representative of authenticity
Officially, came in the game nice, initially
Money and respect over fame and publicity
Sicker than the sycamore tree burning piffery
Know they say: ‘ain't nothing sweeter than a victory’
Mob like I'm from the westside of Sicily
A true lyricist, I am the epitome
Typically speaking or just speaking typically
If rap is a cologne you niggas couldn’t get a whiff of me
I dare one of you chumps beg to differ me
Your foreheads where the back of the four fifth’s will be
This ain't an art or craft, this is a gift to me
I’ve run right through ‘em, just send the list to me
Yeah, smoke like hickory, unsolved lyrical homocide’s a mystery

[Hook]
Look here, stay on your grind (grind, grind, grind, grind…)
Everyday is a struggle, we all hustle and we grind
Lil bruh, get yours, come on stay on your grind, grind, grind
Only the strong survive you know we ride until we grind grind, grind

[Verse 2]
In the hood, it’s a different kinda love cause if you create a spark you can get yourself a plug
Some niggas turn it down, but some niggas turn it up
Yeah, hit the highway and burn it up
Trunk full of white shit, day shift, night shift
And I’m dead wrong but my kids need the right shit
All that and them some, get your hands on the work, then give ya men some
Generation income, save some, spend some, lose some, win some
Fuck it, rent something til the Benz come
Never associate with the frail dudes
Cause time is money and weight make the scale move
Take a great white shark to make a whale move
Seperate all the marks from all the real dudes
Lil’ something on your wrist to tell the time
Whatever you do don’t ever get off your grind

Look here, stay on your grind (grind, grind, grind, grind…)
Everyday is a struggle, we all hustle and we grind
Lil bruh, get yours, come on stay on your grind, grind, grind
Only the strong survive you know we ride until we grind grind, grind

[Verse 3]
Probably sold every drug on the menu
Cause te thuggin’ is in you but the struggle continues
Always bring it the same way, no matter the venue
And keep it brief with niggas cause they’ll try to spend you
The love goes by quick but the hurts long
Rich niggas smile, broke niggas get they smirk on
And I’ll admit I gotta lot of shit to work
But now I’m in the spot till the works gone

Look here, stay on your grind (grind, grind, grind, grind…)
Everyday is a struggle, we all hustle and we grind
Lil bruh, get yours, come on stay on your grind, grind, grind
Only the strong survive you know we ride until we grind, grind, grind
Look here, stay on your grind (grind, grind, grind, grind…)
