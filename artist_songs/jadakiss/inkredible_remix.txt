[Rick Ross]
Trae I see you! Rose' (In-Inkredible..)
You know what it is (Maybach Music)
My attitude is fuck it, house big as Publix
Shoppin is a pleasure, pinky ring a nugget
Niggaz like the ride, sip lean out the bucket
I lean to the side, white whip, Michael Douglas
Hard times, call for drastic measures
I call my dog, he bought a mac 11
Forty rounds hollerin WHERE THE YELLOW AT
Nigga dead serious, chopper with a shoulder strap
Microphone Michael Corleone, I know I'm wrong
The man up above love for me to sing them poems
So sing along, you know the song I sing
Bring them things along, I gotta feed the team
It's ROSE! I need hundred bottles
Yellow bitches, all of 'em swallow
H-Town, nigga three-oh-five
I can move them packs, each and every night

[Trae Tha Truth]
Uhh, gyeah...
Triple black pan the mirror Phantom of the streets
Quarterbackin bricks on top of these glass cleats
All these stones around my neck and wrist part of the streets
Used to temper somethin in danger, now it's part of my seats
I'm in the hood under surveillance buncha haters watchin
Couple choppers out for dinner, failin ain't a option
Reclinable seats, invisible ceilings
Competition is murder, haters I'm killin
Fuck a money machine, I don't count it I blow it
Bitch my money conceited, it look good when I throw it
I'm a asshole, therefore my temper is reckless
I'm the city of Houston, you can tell them it's Texas
The king of the streets, somewhere deep with guerillas
Behind somethin that's tinted, bitch you see the gorillas
These other niggaz yellin Truth, they only imitation
And when I see them it's fuck 'em minus the penetration

[Jadakiss]
Uh-huh... ah-hah!
Yeah, uhh
I'm gettin situated, I know you bitches hate it
I'm in a new Aston, the one Swiss created
I can't give you a dime, but I can get you faded
Before you become a member you get initiated (uh-huh)
A lot of racks, big ice, heavy weapon
The hood still love me cause I never left them (uh-uh)
I distribute it (yeah) I get rid of it (yup)
It's all comin back (uhh) every bit of it
I'm territorial, it's your memorial (yeap)
And don't feel bad, I'm talkin to all of you
This is real shit, and that's nonsense (uh-huh)
I got AK's (what?) I got Thompsons
I got investors (yeah) I get sponsors (uh)
They scared of the crew (scared) I'm with monsters (what?)
And ain't nothin forsure but we touchin the raw (uh)
And they gotta let us in or we rushin the door
