So let’s toast to that!
Gangsta celebration!
So let’s toast to that!
Gangsta celebration!
Let’s toast to that!

Toast to the street life, this is how we eat right
Strip harsh Chris Bosh
Gotta keep the heat tight
Toast to the connect
Cheers to the cheap price,
Toast to those few fellows avoiding the three strikes
New range the cash we took
I threw shoes on the sport it got athletes foot
The God flash the gems I nicknamed your girl Kim
Cause every time the car dash she in
Yeah, I used to scrape the plate, brillow
Had the head swinging back and forth, willow!
Cops try to ban from the court, Bill O'!
Riley stay with his girl, but he know, 
She ain’t a dime, I can see that cellulite shit!
those are just dimes i can see they sell you like shit,
Fred the Godson, Jadakiss was close to that,
Now let’s toast to that!

[Chorus:]
So let’s toast to that!
Just bring the bottles to me!
If you got ‘em from the streets 
you probably got 'em from me
So let’s toast to that!
The street took some of my closest friend
this ain't for ya'll this a toast to 'em
So let’s toast to that!
Gangsta celebration!
So let’s toast to that!
Gangsta celebration!
Let’s toast to that!

Oho! Still squeezing the juice out of the headphones,
Yeah! Put your bottles in the air and make noise with ‘em!
Send your girls to the rear and let my boys hit ‘em!
Fifty large, all hundreds, chip ahoys with em (Cash) 
Four length minks on all the toys with ‘em, 
For those not here, for those still employed with ‘em,
We celebratin' the times we enjoyed with ‘em!(Yes!) 
In a way a part of me was destroyed with ‘em!
Try talking to the Lord, I get annoyed with ‘em,
Things take a hit to feel like Floyd hit ‘em (Mayweather)
It was never beef everything was soy with 'em
Ex-rhythm hunter used to enjoy rhythm.
As the years went by, he learned more wisdom,
Always kept cigars and burn moralism 
We all die the object is to avoid prison,
Yeah! If you ain't paying respect, then you supposed to, 
Cause that’s really something to toast to!

[Chorus:]
So let’s toast to that!
Just bring the bottles to me!
If you got ‘em from the street, 
You probably got ‘em for me!
The street some of my closest friends,
This ain't for ya'll this a toast to 'em
Let’s toast for that!
We gotta toast to that!
So let’s toast to that!
Gangsta celebration!
So let’s toast to that!
Gangsta celebration!
Let’s toast to that!

Yeah! Watch me do a rally if you’re between the streets,
and may all your ups and downs be in between sheets.
Only two choices the powder or the hard,son
Jada the forefather and Fred the Godson!

Jadakiss... Fred is the future, 
It’s about to get ugly, Medusa!
Life still a bitch, when I spit, I seduce her,
Toast from the balls to the shoes.

[Chorus 2x]
So let’s toast to that!
Just bring the bottles to me!
If you got ‘em from the streets 
you probably got 'em from me
So let’s toast to that!
The street took some of my closest friend
this ain't for ya'll this a toast to 'em
So let’s toast to that!
Gangsta celebration!
So let’s toast to that!
Gangsta celebration!
Let’s toast to that!
