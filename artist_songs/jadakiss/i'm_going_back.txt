[VERSE 1:]
Yo I don’t go to church much but I need him a lot
And the ryde is ruff that’s why I got D on my block
So you can’t even get it less I give it to you hard
And everybody don’t get it then some n****s get a nod
I done brung n****s shopping 
Brung n****s touring
Those with high bails came home by the morning
Kept n****s with Nikes on n****s lights on 
Not on no sucka shit trying to make it right for them
Then you try to show ‘em shit
The average n***a don’t appreciate nothing so
All that shit is over with
Entourage light up more shooters than fighters
People that’s there to work stead is there to divide us
No more royalties, loyal fees
The less headaches it is 
More for me
I’ma grown man
It took me a minute to figure out
My career is in my own hand

[CHORUS:]
I’m going back to the way
The way I used to be
I got no love for these n****s 
Cause they ain’t got love for me
I’m going back to the way (uh-huh)
The way I used to be (uh)
With no love for these n****s (naw)
Cause they ain’t got love for me yeah

[VERSE 2:]
Yo, as far as the industry goes
Everybody’s a foe
Only a friend when they want you to flow
I done came straight off the plane into another mans session
And spit pain and ain’t charge him a thing
Had to make my line of respect real thinner
Started getting real hungry 
I needed a real dinner
Sin whoever you want, I’m kissing them all 
Did a track with everybody except Mr. Shakur
To me a plaque ain’t nothing
But some shit for the wall
And I ain’t hating on the people who got ‘em 
I got a lot of ‘em
But I don’t got the money they got 
So I ain’t proud of ‘em
I’m proud of me
Cause only I can get the guts out of me (what)

[CHORUS:]
I’m going back to the way (yeah)
The way I used to be
I got no love for these n****s (naw)
Cause they ain’t got love for me (uh)
I’m going back to the way (uh-huh)
The way I used to be (yeah)
With no love for these n****s (naw)
Cause they ain’t got love for me yeah

[VERSE 3:]
Even though I’m strong
The bullshit still be penetrating
It ain’t nothing personal ya’ll
I’m just ventilating
It was starting to make me tense
How I put a dent in the game
And came back to make more dents
More than one hand on the gun
Just makes more prints 
The older I get 
The Bible starts to make more sense
When I drive by and give you the horn
I ain’t flip, I’m just handling my business
And keeping it going
Instead of pieces, I’m getting the lumps for real for real
And get a n***a ass like I did from the jump
Cause usually a problem would help
And you always gonna need somebody
But all you got is yourself that’s why

[CHORUS:]
I’m going back to the way
The way I used to be
I got no love for these n****s 
Cause they ain’t got love for me 
I’m going back to the way 
The way I used to be 
With no love for these n****s 
Cause they ain’t got love for me yeah
