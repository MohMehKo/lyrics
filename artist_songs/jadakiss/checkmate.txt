You did it baby!
Congratulations, homie!
You made history!
1.1 million in a short week! [laughs]
Screw a press conference, press this on your conscience!
D-Block, cheers!
Yeah!
I ain't mad, I don't wanna sound mad, I feel marvelous..
D-Block, Double R, fuckin' faggots..

We gon' handle this like grown men, you won't win
You don't even feel comfortable in your own skin
I rap my ass off, I'm fightin' the champ with the glass jaw
at the Garden or Nassau
See me, couple hood niggaz behind stars
I heard you put a couple good niggaz bars, (Preme!)
I might never sell that much
But you can bet your last 2 quarters, I never tell that much
Picture 'Kiss not come out swingin'
It's like going to see 50 at a show and he don't come out singin'
Yeah, you got a felony, but you ain't a predicate
Never the King of New York, you live in Connecticut
You don't be in the hood, you be in the woods
Fuckin' wit' me, is where you really gon' be for good
I hold the 4-5 myself, and hop out the Range on 1-4-5 myself
This is a true fact
Since when has it become cool to get shot and not shoot back
Trackmasters shelfed you, Bravehearts helped you
Then everybody felt you, now I gotta melt you
And don't try to pull rank on 'Kiss
Cause the niggaz I'ma send to do it ain't gon' miss
Be layed up stiff, I spit straight up 'piph
I did real songs with BIG, no made-up shits
And I don't got a problem with clout
You ain't get shot again yet, so what's your second album about? (Nothin'!)
Your raps are pre-school, you made a lot of money, now be cool
'Fore I swell up your lips like seafood
Can I get a mic check? You don't stand a chance
To dance with me dog, ya steps ain't right yet
Block is just fine, homie, the D's straight
Most likely your new CD is a weed plate
Bunch of love songs, 100% pure garbage
Just somethin' to break up buds on
You should just sell clothes and sneakers
Cause outta your whole camp your flow's the weakest
I'm in the town where the young boys is clappin', (clappin')
You runnin' around with the lieutenant and captain, [laughs]
It'll take a lifetime to see 'Kiss
You had to get shot 9 times to be rich

Rat ass nigga, you's a animal
You's a motherfuckin' animal

Pig ass nigga, you's a animal
You's a motherfuckin' animal

Snake ass nigga, you's a animal
You's a motherfuckin' animal

Matter of fact, you ain't no animal
I'ma show these motherfuckers how to handle you

D-Block!
