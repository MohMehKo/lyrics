[Intro: Jadakiss]
Uh Huh! I just want to tell you that I love you
Yeah! And I appreciate everything you done for me thus far
EH HEH!

[Chorus: Chryk Show (Jadakiss)]
When they ask we don't play around (Nah!)
Know that, roll that, and then we lay 'em down (Yeah!)
Niggas hustle on the block with them K's 'round
Gettin fast paper keep the chopper just to lay 'em down (Lay 'em down)
If you try, give that lame a lullaby
Make 'em touch the sky, and if we gotta we lay 'em down (Lay 'em down)
Trust me, if I gotta spray the pound
I won't hesitate, for one second to lay it down

[Verse 1: Jadakiss (Styles P)]
Yo! Another man down let me see you try to live through 'em
(I had the whole town talkin 'bout what I did to 'em)
Funny how quick they forget what I did to 'em
(Life or death situation I had I split through 'em)
Still left the click off (Couple more to pick off)
When the drama is lit you can't cut the quick off
(Streets taught him well, learned it until it cost him)
Precipitated the hate and turned it into a fortune
(Never would have tried his hand, but they forced him)
So right after they fried his man, then they offed him
(Yeah you know the G's) They may stop right below the knees
(Four door shit from overseas)
Undreboss from the other side
(Blame me when you hear that they killed his whole mother's side)
Never the money, always for the love of I 
(After you put him to bed) I sing him a lullaby
MUAH!!!!

[Chorus: Chryk Show (Jadakiss)]
When they ask we don't play around (Nah!)
Know that, roll that, and then we lay 'em down (Yeah!)
Niggas hustle on the block with them K's 'round
Gettin fast paper keep the chopper just to lay 'em down (Lay 'em down)
If you try, give that lame a lullaby
Make 'em touch the sky, and if we gotta we lay 'em down (Lay 'em down)
Trust me, if I gotta spray the pound
I won't hesitate, for one second to lay it down

[Verse 2: Jadakiss (Styles P)]
Yo! Give that lame a lullaby (Bedtime story)
You wouldn't die if dude (Fed time for me)
You 'gon fuck around and make the (Headline story)
Bitch in the whip lettin it (Redline for me)
Buck ninety somethin on the freeway (Sucker free!)
Five less than twenty for the bird (Nigga fuck with me!)
Three less that six for the P (Get it on the arm!)
Organic dope 'cause (You can get it on the farm)
(I'm a Godfather) I'm a Don
(My bond is my word) Word is my bond
(Can't be stopped in the first or the (Fourth quarter)
(Work comin in on the docks, now that's a) Boss order
(Big diamonds, clear like) Horse water
(Payin money to the judge fuck the!) Court order!
(Do it Big like) Frank White
And The K will put your brains on the floor (Like it ain't right)
WHAT!

[Chorus: Chryk Show (Jadakiss)]
When they ask we don't play around (Nah!)
Know that, roll that, and then we lay 'em down (Yeah!)
Niggas hustle on the block with them K's 'round
Gettin fast paper keep the chopper just to lay 'em down (Lay 'em down)
If you try, give that lame a lullaby
Make 'em touch the sky, and if we gotta we lay 'em down (Lay 'em down)
Trust me, if I gotta spray the pound
I won't hesitate, for one second to lay it down
