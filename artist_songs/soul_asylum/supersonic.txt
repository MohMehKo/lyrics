Call me at the office
Call me sad but true
It calls me when you call me
It keeps me in my room

Supersonic just how you want it
Catatonic she's always on it
Supersonic she's always on the way

Automatic autumn
Left it sound insane
We are moving onward
Wasting away

Supersonic just how you want it
Catatonic she's always on the way
Supersonic she's always on the way

Walk through the gates
As they watch you arrive
Then you become someone in and out of line

So meet me at the station
Let's pretend to go somewhere

Supersonic I'm always on it
Catatonic just how you want it
It's so ironic
I'm always on the way

Supersonic just how you want it
Catatonic electron electronic
You promised I'm always on the way
