You could be my guardian angel
Woe before and die a stranger
Day by day, night by night
Let me know that you're all right

Tell me know am I cool enough, cool enough for you
What do I got to do to be cool enough to help with you

I'll just sit and keep to myself
He just too soon be someone else
I'll be there, when you stop to cry
You won't vision some other guy

Tell me know am I cool enough, cool enough for you
What do I got to do to be cool enough to help with you

You could show me all the anger

Tell me know am I cool enough, cool enough for you
What do I got to do to be cool enough to help with you
Tell me know am I cool enough, cool enough for you
What do I got to do to be cool enough to help with you
