She don't need an introduction
She ain't gonna stop production
She's gonna make you feel a suction
She's got the weapons of mass destruction

She's solar-powered
She's never saying anything
And the sun shines out of her everywhere

She sees best without her glasses
She does well in all her classes
A cheek for your lips and a cheek for the masses

She's got weapons (she's got weapons)
She's got weapons

It's so strange
You don't change
It's so strange
You don't change

Slowly rising

She's solar-powered
She's never saying anything
And the sun shines out of her everywhere

He's got the money and you can't have it (he's got the money and you can't have it)
She's got the power and he's got the habit (she's got the power and he's got the habit)
She's gonna make you feel her posture (she's gonna make you feel her posture)

She's got weapons (she's got weapons)
She's got weapons (weapons, weapons)

It's so strange
You don't change
It's so strange
You don't change

Slowly rising

She's solar powered
She's never saying anything
And the sun shines off her everywhere
