I'm all alone
The show's over
Night crawlers crawling closer
Somewhere is temptation
Could it just be my imagination
Was it all just a dream at the bottom of a glass
Next time don't wake me up
All this too must pass

Call me up when you find out what life means
Does it hide in the fire of a smoke screen
Like a match burning fast in the cold breeze
Like a house made of glass in a pipe dream

Even so it gets harder
Can't finish what you can't get started
Everywhere seems so brown signs of life are happening anyhow
Should I just disappear behind a one way glass remain
Invisible all this too must pass

So, call me up when you find out what life means
Does it hide in the fire of a smoke screen
Like a match burning fast in the cold breeze
Like a house made of glass in a pipe dream

Late at night when I can't sleep
Listen down to the sound on the street
Then the dawn, the dawn comes chasing
To remind me of the time I'm wasting

So, call me up when you find out what life means
Does it hide in the fire of a smoke screen
Like a match burning fast in the cold breeze
Like a house made of glass in a pipe dream

Like a match burning fast in the cold breeze
Like a house made of glass in a pipe dream
