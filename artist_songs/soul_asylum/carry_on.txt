This will be over
I hope you don't mind the pain
I wanna cut you
And let you force it out clean

It'd be a shot quick
I think I know how this works
Things will be better
Because they can't get much worse

And we will carry on
Carryâ€¦ carry on

Now, I can't carry the weight of your hang-ups
They're dead weight, they're made out of lead
And I can't carry the guilt and frustration
Of something someone else said

Now I'm just learning to carry myself
Carry myself on my own
Now I'm just looking to carry myself
Carry on, carry on, carry on

Whenever I see you
I know you think I don't know
That I could be you
And your thoughts they don't show

I want to trust you
I want to trust you so bad
I want to bust you
Stealing the few things we had

And we will carry on
Carry on

Now, I can't carry the weight of your hang-ups
They're dead weight, they're made out of lead
And I can't carry the guilt and frustration
Of something someone else said

Now I'm just learning to carry myself
Carry myself on my own
Now I'm just looking to carry myself
Carry on, carry on, carry on

(Now's the place to lose your faith
Keep the faith that reinstates the habits
That are forming what you feel)

This will be over
