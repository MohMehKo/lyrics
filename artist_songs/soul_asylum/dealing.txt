Everybody knows anything goes
We were only trying to have a good time
Living while you learn, you'll get your turn
We were only living with the one life

When you point the finger, do you often find it pointed back at you?
When you look in mirror, do you wonder who is looking back at you?

And this is what we're dealing
This is what we're dealing with

Every move you make's like a slithering snake
Winding up the coil to wasting your time
I don't know what you heard, this is absurd
You're trying to set yourself up for last time

When you point the finger, do you often find it pointed back at you?
When you look in mirror, do you wonder who is looking back at you?

And this is what we're dealing
This is what we're dealing with
And this is what we're dealing
This is what we're dealing with

When you look in the mirror, do you wonder who is looking back at you?
When you point the finger, do you often find it pointed back at you?

And this is what we're dealing
This is what we're dealing with
This is what we're dealing
This is what we're dealing with
