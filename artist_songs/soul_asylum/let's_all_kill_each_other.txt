(Let's all kill each other)

I've been reading everything, the papers and the magazines, believin' every word I read
Way too many mouths to feed, but we can all agree believing everybody's better off dead
If you're lookin' for some inspiration, blast off through the generation

Let's all kill each other
Kill your sisters and kill your brothers
Take the fun out of one another
Let's all kill each other

I'm not having any fun, I'm sick and tired of everyone, I wonder what's the right thing to do
Knives and guns for everyone, now everyone protects someone, at least that's what I learned from you
Just can't trust anyone else, gonna have to do it ourselves

Let's all kill each other
Kill your fathers and kill your mothers
Take the life of one another
Let's all kill each other

Let's all kill each other
Kill your sisters and kill your brothers
Take the fun out of one another
Let's all kill each other

Maybe we could talk it out
Maybe I could shut you down
Everything's so complicated
I can't believe how long we've waited
I can try to figure it out
I know what to do about it
I know what to do about it

Let's all kill each other

If you're looking for a little reaction, here comes your coming attraction

Let's all kill each other
Kill your sisters and kill your brothers
Take the fun out of one another
Let's all kill each other

Let's all kill each other
Kill your fathers and kill your mothers
Take the life of one another
Let's all kill each other
