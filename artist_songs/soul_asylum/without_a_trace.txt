I fell in love with a hooker
She laughed in my face
So seriously I took her
I was a disgrace

I was out of line
I was out of place
Out of time to save face
See the open mouth of my suitcase
Saying "Leave this place...
Leave without a trace..."
Leave without a trace

I tried to get a good job
With honest pay
Might as well join the mob
The benefits are okay

Standing in the sun with a popsicle
Anything is possible
With a lot of luck and a pretty face
And some time to waste
Leave without a trace...
Leave without a trace...

I tried to dance at a funeral
New Orleans style
I joined the Grave Dancers Union
I had to file
Trying to do the right thing
Play it straight
The right thing changes from state to state
Don't forget to take your mace
If you're out working late
I liked to see your face
You left without a trace
Leave without a trace
