I guess I'll see you later, sweet manipulator 
And how I thank you dearly, for helping me see clearly 
Yes sir, no sir, let me go 
Sir I don't even want to know 
Sir I've had all that I can take today 
But I found out so long ago 
It don't matter if it shows 
And it's up in the air tonight 
Yes it's up in the air tonight 
Now you're anticipating, that nostalgia's waiting 
With your social statement, boxed up in the basement 
Yes ma'am, no ma'am, let me go ma'am 
I don't even give a damn 
Ma'am I suppose I'll stand another day 
I booked my flight despite my plans 
I hope this flight it never lands 
And it's up in the air tonight 
Yes it's up in the air tonight 
Cause I've got all night 
To lie here on the floor, I got all night 
Just like the night before, so make it soon 
And I guess I'll see you later 
I guess I'll see you later, I guess I'll see you later 
I guess I'll see you later, we're so up in the air tonight
