Well, well, now what the hell has gotten into you 
Is it something we can make it through 
I'll spend the rest of my life trying to figure you out 
Like a black silhouette in a shadow of doubt 
Some kinda spectacle that no one can see through 
But it burns inside, you hide it well 
You hide it from yourself 
And you promise that you won't tell 
Promise that you won't tell, promise that you won't tell 
Promise that you won't yell, secret no more, secret no more 
Now I know that something's wrong 
And I'll find out before too long 
Only you can break my solitude 
Don't you tell anyone I told you this 
We got to die to spread your disease too 
But it burns inside, you hide it well 
And you promise that you won't tell 
Promise that you won't tell 
Promise that you won't tell 
Promise that you won't yell 
Secret no more, secret no more 
Promise that you won't tell, promise that you won't tell 
Promise that you won't tell, promise that you won't yell 
Secret no more, secret no more 
Secret no more, secret no more
