It was the day after vacation
Heading back to school
Roll over say goodbye
And whisper I love you

It floated up around the room and drifted towards the door
Then the phone rang, the mailman came
Left me wanting more

Sometimes it just hangs in the air
Like a crime without a clue
But just like that you got me back
And you said I love you too

I got my I love you too
I got my I love you too
I'm gonna squeeze it right out of you
That's when I know I got the juice

We both stared at the ceiling
There's always work to do
With all these mixed up feelings
Floating around the room

Like a lost echo hanging in the hills
Trying to find it's way back home
Closer and closer
Like a skippin' stone

I got my I love you too
I got my I love you too
Well, it's all I ever wanted from you
That's when I know I got the juice

Later on that evening
Around the time I get so tense
The rooms seem like cages
The walls seem like a fence

I got my I love you too
Yes I got my I love you too
And the whole wide world is waiting for you
For you to say I love you too
