It's a shame you're not here
On the cross in my ear
Hearing things loud and clear
Come outside have no fear

And clear the smoke, get some fresh air
Someone waits, someone cares
In the broad light of day trouble seems so far away
At the top of the day when the reign sways

Lose the cradle chain, give it up, give it a name
The child that remains, nothing's lost
Take these chains, take them away

Please don't ask me how I am
A little tired, a little scared
I'm not amused, not upset
Don't need a leash
I'm not your pet

So loosen up, feel the breeze
Let me hear, hear you breathe
It's better than, bitter now
When you breathe I love that sound
But you know I'll look after you like no one

Lose the cradle chain, give it up, give it a name
The child that remains, nothing's lost
Take these chains, take them away

If I die before I wake, light a fuse, bake a cake
I don't mind if I go, make it quick, don't be slow
But you know I'll remember you like no one

Lose the cradle chain, give it up, give it a name
The smile that remains will take these chains away
