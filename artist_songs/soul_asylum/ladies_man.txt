(It's recording
No you're not
Yes she is
See up top
Crank it up man
Turn it on Dave)

As you make your way through the fresh demolition
You better think of something that sounds true
Cause you're the last fighter on the planet
And everyone can see the sadness that's inside of you
Long live exile isolation

Now he's a ladies man
He's a ladies man
He's a ladies man
He's a ladies man

All aboard for an all expense paid vacation
This landscape demands an explanation
Pack your bags cause we're going to hell
Captain's drinking at the wishing well
Will he ever ever really learn?

Now he's a ladies man
He's a ladies man
He's a ladies man
Well he's a ladies man

Take it back to the next abomination
Get yourself ready for the ride you've been waiting for
Hot rods and real cool revelations

Yes he's a ladies man
Well he's a ladies man
Yes he's a ladies man
Well he's a ladies man
He's a ladies, ladies, ladies man
He's a ladies man
But she's lady man

Take cover
Take cover
Take cover in the dumpster
Take cover in the dumpster
Take cover
