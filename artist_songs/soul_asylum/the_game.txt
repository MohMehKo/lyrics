My friend's wife, she plays the game 
Plays it with me all the time 
Makes me feel pretty good, I guess 
Hey that's a pretty dress 
But you shouldn't have 
No, you shouldn't have, let me know 
No you shouldn't have 
Really shouldn't have, let it show 
Play with me, don't play with me, don't play 
Play with me, don't play with me, don't play 
Don't you wanna play the game? 
If I were a renegade 
And you were the county line 
Will I have to cross it now 
I got yours and you got mine 
But you shouldn't have 
No, you shouldn't have, let it go 
Play with me, don't play with me, don't play 
Play with me, don't play with me, don't play 
Don't you wanna play the game? 
Jealousy is just a game 
It ties you up and wraps around your brain 
Makes you feel like you might hurt yourself 
Makes you feel insane 
Play with me, don't play with me, don't play 
Play with me, don't play with me, don't play 
Don't you wanna play the game?
