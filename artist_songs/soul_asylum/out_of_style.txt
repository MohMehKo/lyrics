Don't you realize most girls know how to walk
And do you think that you would last more than a while
And don't you keep up with the fashion

This weeks mannequins are not sporting passion
Ooh, oh, oh, oh you must find something new
Ooh, oh, oh, oh you hate me, and I'll hate you

New boots and jacket, what else can I do
I'm so in today, stayin' away from you
I've got you pregnant, ahhh you're so out of style
Hem me up, just tie a not, I'll send you a ball

Ohh, oh, oh, oh we must find something new
Ohh, oh, oh, oh run around and I'll piss on you

Can't you find a better way to waste a lick of time
I'll find someone, hey, join this special group of mine
I know what you're thinking, I know what you want to do
Cause I'm a fashion connoisseur, and I've got my gun on you

Woah, oh, oh, oh

Love you [x8]

Love you [x8]

Don't you realize love's gone out of style
Don't you realize love's gone out of style
Don't you realize love's gone out of style

Don't you realize? love's gone out of style
