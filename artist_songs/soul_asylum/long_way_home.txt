You've got eyes but they can't see 
What's inside a tv and they never look at me 
You won't know and you're never claim to show 
That special feeling inside 
Oh how time flies when its got nowhere to go 
Up to the skies and it only goes to show 
I've waited here for you a long, long time 
I think I'd better go 
Long way home [x4]
So now you studied the changes 
Have you lost your way 
Through all the strangeness 
And you got no more to say 
Long way home [x8]
