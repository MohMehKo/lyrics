Folks tell jokes in clouds of smoke 
Making sure life won't decay 
Fancy flags fly in your face 
Fall polluting in my space 
Pounds of sounds from shotgun rounds 
Music of the hit parade 
No your fathers, fathers, fathers 
He's got nothing left to say 
On the day you walked away 
Another world, another day
