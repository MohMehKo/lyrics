The bank keeps draggin' me down, gonna rip it from my heart
Drown and shut out the sound, comedy's about to start
World's been draggin' me down, prepare your inner child
I keep draggin' me down, let me run before I walk

It's only water, it's only rain, it's only teardrops, it's only pain

But it's draggin' me down, draggin' me down, draggin' me down
Stop draggin' me down, draggin' me down, draggin' me down

My mom's been draggin' me down
Everytime I stop to think
Mom you're pushing down, my hands are startin' to stink
World's been draggin' me down, don't die I'm warnin' you
I keep draggin' you down
Can't even help myself

It's only water, it's only rain, it's only teardrops, only pain

World is draggin' me down, draggin' me down, draggin' me down
Stop draggin' me down, draggin' me down, draggin' me down

Ahh, ahh, c'mon make me smile
Hey, hey, I'll be- I'll be alright in a while
Hey, hey, it's not like I have some special infection
I just want that good 'ole-fashioned affection

One, two, draggin' me down, draggin' me down, draggin' me down
Stop draggin' me down, draggin' me down, draggin' me down

It's only water, it's only rain, it's only teardrops, only pain

Stop draggin' me down, draggin' me down, draggin' me down
Stop draggin' me down, draggin' me down, draggin' me down

Draggin' me down, draggin' me down, draggin' me down
Draggin' me down, draggin' me down, draggin' me down
Draggin' me down, draggin' me down, draggin' me down

Uuuhh
