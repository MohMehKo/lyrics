You're so full of fuckin' lies
You also live a fucked up life
Cut you up and la, da, da
I can't get enough of your clock

I just want you to have some fun
I tried to fuck you for a buck
Shows how I fucked up everyone
I'll never get enough of your clock

Oh, oh, a-oh
Oh, oh, a-oh
Oh, oh, a-oh

Are ya'll tucked in to ready to play
Ya'll tucked in to ready get away
Folks off the street callin' don't be late
I haven't had enough of your clock

Before the sundown fa, la, la
Ya, ya, ya, blah, blah, blah
Who's that shreikin' push and shove
I can't get enough of your clock

Oh, oh, a-oh
Oh, oh, a-oh
Oh, oh, a-oh

You all make me wonder why
You're fucked up these bitches die
Wonderin' where and when to die
I can't get enough of your clock
