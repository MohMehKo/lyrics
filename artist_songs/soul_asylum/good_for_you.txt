It brings me peace
when your asleep
alone together
in a moment that lasts forever
and when you smile
it brings me peace
it's like everything i ever wanted
and i want so bad to be good for you
i could be good for you
i think i'd be good for you
yes, i think i'd be good for you
just like orange juice
i walk around the lake
like putting to good use
something you thought was fake
in the afterlife, well who really cares
this one's good enough just as long as youre there
and i want so bad to be good for you
i could be good for you
i think i'd be good for you
yes, i could be for you
and what is sacred, well this i know
it's just me and you on a train moving slow to heaven
it's just like mama
she used to say
when i told her that everything's ok
she just said good for you
that's so good for you
oh that's good for you
i think it'd be good for you
yeah, i think i'd be good for you
i could be good for you
yeah, i think i could be good for you
i think i could, i think i could, i think i could!
i could be good for you....
