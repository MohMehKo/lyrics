Got it figured out I guess
It's going pretty good but I couldn't care less
Blow me off and blow me down
You got me right I'm a goddamn clown

See I need the kinda help that I can't get anywhere else
She only helps those who help themselves
I can't help myself

Don't give a fuck what you think about me
I'm just another bad apple fallen far from the tree

See I need the kinda help that I can't get anywhere else
She only helps those who help themselves
I can't help myself

You want it, I'm on it
Come on, come on, come on
I can't help it, I just can't help it

I tried and tried to talk to you
It just don't matter cause it just ain't true

See I need the kinda help that I can't get anywhere else
She only helps those who help themselves
I can't help myself
Cause I can't help it
I just can't help it
I can't help it
Can't help it
I just can't help it

No I can't help
Go 'head help yourself
Come one, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Help your fuckin' self
