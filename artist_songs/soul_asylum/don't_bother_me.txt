She took her time and then she took mine
But it don't bother me, no it don't bother me
She gave me a nickel, she said it was a dime
But it don't bother me, no it don't bother me

And I ain't lyin'
I'll just go on tryin'
These are better days than yesterday

And why do I bother looking for trouble?
Trouble will always find me
I'll figure it out one way or the other
I'm not gonna let it bother me

She took my life, she took her sweet time
As far as I can see, as far as the eye can see
In the eye of the beholder is so much colder
As far as the eye can see, as far as I can see

Well, I once had a vision
It's just endless indecision
These are troubled waters we've survived before
So many times before, so many times before

And why do I bother looking for trouble?
Trouble will always find me
I'll figure it out one way or the other
I'm not gonna let it bother me

She took her time and then she took mine
But it don't bother me, no it don't bother me

I'm tired of tryin'
I ain't even lyin'
These are ways I've seen this go before
So many times before, so many times before

And why do I bother looking for trouble?
Trouble will always find me
I'll figure it out one way or the other
I'm not gonna let it bother me

And why do I bother looking for trouble?
Trouble will always find me
I'll figure it out one way or the other
I'm not gonna let it bother me
