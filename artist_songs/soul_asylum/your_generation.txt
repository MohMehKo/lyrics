Trying to forget your generation
You know all the ways when in what I see
The ends must justify the means
Your generation don't mean a thing to me
I say your generation don't mean a thing to me
I say your generation don't mean a thing to me

It might take a bit of violence
But violence ain't our only stance
It might make our friends enemies
But we gotta take that chance
There ain't no time for substitutes
There ain't no time for idle threats
Cause actions are rather hard to place
Cause what you give is what you get

That's your generation
It's your generation
But it's your generation
But it's your generation

Trying to forget your generation
You know all the ways when in what I see
The ends must justify the means
Your generation don't mean a thing to me
I say your generation don't mean a thing to me
I say your generation don't mean a thing to me

Might take a bit of violence
But violence ain't our only stance
Might make our friends enemies
But we gotta take that chance
There ain't no time for substitutes
There ain't no time for idle threats
Cayuse actions are rather hard to place
Cause what you give is what you get

So that's your generation
It's your generation
Well it's your generation
It's your generation

Your generation to the end
To the end
Your generation to the end
To the end
Your generation to the end
To the end
Your generation
