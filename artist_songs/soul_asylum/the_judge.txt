I see you passing judgment
It ain't a judgment day
And I can't let you misjudge me that way

Ain't shooting for perfection
I'm scared of my reflection
But I can't let you misjudge me that way

I used to think that I could raise myself above it
You could make me break down and cry
But you can't make me love it

And I can't fake it, you can't take it
I ain't holdin' no grudge

'Cause I can't judge him, and you can't judge him
And who's gonna judge the judge?

Who's gonna judge the judge?

High falootin aloofing
Has got you in its ways
And I can't let you misjudge me that way

Not that I care what you think of me
But I hear every word that you say
And I can't let you misjudge me that way

Sticks and stones may break my bones, but I can take the blame
You can find yourself a new scapegoat, but I won't play no game

I can't make it, you can't take it
I ain't holding no grudge
'Cause I can't judge him, and you can't judge him
And who's gonna judge the judge?
Who's gonna judge the judge?

Whooooo-aaaa

(What did you do, so beautiful, so pretty
You look so pretty, beautiful)

I see you pointing fingers
You're pointing one my way
And I can't let you misjudge me that way

Now, now, now I never said I was innocent for justice is gonna find a way
And I can't let you misjudge me that way

No, no, no I can't let you misjudge me that way
And I can't let you misjudge me that way-ay-ay-ay
