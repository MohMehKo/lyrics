If you're walking home late at night, dressed up and alone 
Dont you get tired of being white, buffalo never roam 
Go to sneak up behind you, still your boss tapped your phone 
'Coz you might be keepin secrets, that you ain't supposed to know 
Now it's about to be and your bus and the lovely miss liberty 
Is just another whore, there's somethin I gotta tell ya 
It's hard to see things your way and its hard to understand the things you say 
Most of all its hard to get hard these days, now if you got to hate someone 
You might as well hate yourself, you find that you dont deserve it now 
More than anyone else, so get out of your kitchen 
And get out of your bed, got to tell them what you've always wanted to tell them 
'Coz in the morning you might be dead so dont call the doctor 
'Coz I'll be ok, its just a passing sad daydream and it led me astray 
And its hard to see things your way, and its hard to understand the things you say 
But most of all, its hard to get hard these days, and I ain't proud of nothin 
But its better that way 'coz its too loud for talkin, and there aint much to say 
So pick up your explosives, and pack up your gun, if you ain't chasin someone 
You got to be on the run, and Im so far from home now 
Nothin better anyway, I aint lookin to make a livin now 
I just need a place to stay
