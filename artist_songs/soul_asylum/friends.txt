Well I've been distressed, via pressed, tossed in white cement
Handin'in to buy the bottle where you can't hardly ever win
And I see you walkin' on the street, and you look so all alone
Well, I could be your mystery, but you can't take me home

Don't you need someone to call
I ain't afraid to fall
I can't face myself alone
I need a real life friend

Well I'm the toughest motherfucker that you ever did see
I never shed no tears in my life, so I know you can laugh for me
And I see you 'round the corner with your pants so goddamn tight
Do you think that all this money's gonna make, everything alright

Just give me someone to call
I ain't afraid to fall
Finish myself alone
I need a real life friend

I've got to presentate for fancy friends who talk behind my back
Friends who I'm afraid to call, got friends who'll leave me back
I got friends who steal my credit cards and friends to take you for a ride
Friends who give me ha-ha-ha, cause you keep me on your side
I got friends who sell me guilty pleasure, and know friends just like you
Friends who scared I'm invincible and tell me what to do
I got so many dirty friends, so many I don't even know
What do I need my friends for hey, hey, hey, somebody

Don't you need a friend to call
I ain't afraid to fall
Can't finish myself alone
I need a real life friend
