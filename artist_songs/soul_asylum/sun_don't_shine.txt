Picture if you will a house on the hill
Where the family kills each other for a place in the will
Understand that he came a dirty old man
That holds a plastic rosary in the palm of his hand

And under the rug you will sweep (under the rug you will sweep)
Secrets and promises that you can't keep (promises that you can't keep)
The dam it will leak, it will weep
Said "I'd like to tell you how I feel", you said "You know that can't be real, it's much too deep"

Why'd you wanna watch and wait, you can't walk on water
Get your feet on the ground
There's a hole in the floor, hole in the door
Whole wide world waiting to turn you around

And under the rug you will sweep (and under the rug you will sweep)
Secrets and promises you can't keep (promises that you can't keep)
The dam it will leak, it will weep
Said "I'd like to tell you how I feel", you said "You know that can't be real, it's much too deep"

Now how will you keep yourself busy?
Take the trouble you're leaving behind
And dig down deep where you do not belong there
Shine a light where the sun doesn't shine

Seven days, still no sign of daylight
Your tunnel's collapsing from behind
And how the hell did I get to Alaska
Will it shine, the light where the sun doesn't shine?
