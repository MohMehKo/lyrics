You know you got an understanding
How to make it better
I shouldn't be so damn demanding
Write it down in a letter

You can see what you wanna
Lay it out on the table
Could you be any wronger?
Can you hear what I'm saying?

How you gonna make it real?
How you gonna make it, how you gonna make it
How you gonna make it feel?
And we won't look the other way

How long you gonna keep on standing
For this misunderstanding
You know it's all a half-assed scam now
And it's all in your head

You can say what you wanna
Take a spin of the wheel

How you gonna make it real?
How you gonna make it, how you gonna make it
How you gonna make it feel?
And we won't look the other way

Everything is happening
Everything's virtually happening
Running out of time
Standing in line
Try to find a way to make it real this time

You know you got an understanding
How to make it real

How you gonna make it real?
How you gonna make it, how you gonna make it
How you gonna make it feel?
How you gonna make it?
How you gonna make it?
