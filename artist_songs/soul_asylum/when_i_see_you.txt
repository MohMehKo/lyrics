I can see I'm so far away
Can't see it any other way
When it really works I don't get in the way

Is this a job, is this a joke
I'm breathing fire, you're blowing smoke
I've been blinded by what I know
And all I know

Is when I see you, I wanna be with you
I want you to see the real me

Now what if I get lost on the way
And I say all those things you don't want me to say
What if we're still going the same way

You're not a victim, not in danger
I'm not your rival, not a stranger
I've been blinded by what I know
And all I know

When I see you, I wanna be with you
I want you to see the real me
When I see you I wanna be with you
I want you to see what's inside of me

No matter what you do or what you say
I want you to change, but you can change

When I see you I want to be with you
I want you to see the real me
When I see you I wanna be with you
I want you to see what's inside of me

I want you to be
I want you to be whoever you want to be
