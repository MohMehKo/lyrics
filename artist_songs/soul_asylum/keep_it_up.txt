I'm down here waiting on a shattered heart
I'm gonna put it back together if it tears me apart
If I can keep it up.. If I can keep it up

I been complaining like a broken record
Gonna get what I want, if it takes forever
If I can keep it up... If I can keep it up

Though the rain weighs down your wings
Still the caged bird's got to sing
Singing "Na na na na na na na na na"

I know it seem funny, try to understand
It's just that things don't always go the way you plan
Still you keep it up... Still you keep it up

Nothing in the world's gonna keep me down
I'm just a holding out, and just a hanging around
Trying to keep it up.. Just to keep it up

Though the rain weighs down your wings
Still the caged bird's got to sing
Singing "Na na na na na na na na na"

Keep it up.... Keep it up

A seven forty-seven's gonna take us away
Take us up to heaven, gonna be okay
If we can keep it up.. If we can keep it up

Though the rain weighs down your wings
Still the caged bird's got to sing
Singing "Na na na na na na na na na"
