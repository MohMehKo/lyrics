I'm gonna leave this town
Gonna leave, gonna leave this town now
I'm gonna go so far away
I'm gonna go so far away

I got my bottle and a dirty old coat
So many stories that I don't even know
I got no place, got nowhere to go

I'm gonna go so far away
I'm gonna go so far away

City streets
lost control
That's just the way we roll

I'm gonna leave this place behind
I'm gonna find some place of mind
I'm gonna leave this town
Gonna leave, gonna leave this town now
