Riding into town when the sun goes down 
And the natives get restless and the crowd comes round 
Pacing in place in a backward race 
While starting my case to another blank face 
I'm just sitting on the roadside 
Watching all the cards and the clouds roll by 
They may pass me by 
But i need a better reason to cry 
Growing pain it leaves a stain 
That's similar but not the same 
It's down the drain and what remains 
Maybe you're the one who's a little insane 
Now everything's lovely if you're ugly 
What you would, what you should, and what you could be 
Mr right, spending his life, 
Stabbing himself with a butter knife 
I'm just sitting on the roadside 
Watching all the cards and the clouds roll by 
They may pass me by 
But I need a better reason to cry 
Growing pain's a spinning blade 
Whirling round you like a razor edged chain 
It's down the drain and what remains 
Maybe you're the one who's a little insane 
Growing pain it leaves a stain 
That's similar but not the same 
Its down the drain and what remains 
Maybe you're the one who can make that change 
Can't shake hands with boxing gloves 
With whips and chains you'll never make love
