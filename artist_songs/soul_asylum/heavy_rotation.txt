Order in this court you call my own
Confusion is the order I have shown

Some things don't come easy
Some things got to give
You just might have to waste your life just to live

Now did you think that I was somebody?
And did you think this was somewhere?
I will still be there
So watch out

Well, I got the right to free myself of fear
Stand over me and watch me disappear
You're sent to the death to be in another mess
To keep your mind, to keep them in
I don't know where they're meeting to pretend

Well, I am the one that soaks it up
Well, I am the one that takes a punch
And I am, I am, I am the human sponge

Could I be so serious, or am I just too curious?
Just afraid to look away for missing something you might say

'Cause you've got so much I can't follow
One more debt I can't repay
Tomorrow brings just one more chance to throw it all away
I'm just trying to live with today
And I'm just trying to live with the way
The way I am?

I am
I am
I am
I am
I am
I am
I am
I am
I am
