Jesus was a hippie, peace and love was all he was about
That's why they killed him, cause that shit's something people can't figure out
Now some folks who worship him are the ones who would have cheered at the crucifixion
They got no conviction it doesn't matter if the man was fact or fiction

But who're you gonna call your fearless leader
Who's gonna put your fears to bed
Cause heroes will never let you down just as long as they're dead

Satan is a feeling, deviance it lurks in everyone
Guilty pleasures and mischievous behavior can be fun
But no one made you do it, nobody but yourself to blame
It's always at your door and trouble is it's name

But who're you gonna call your fearless leader
Who's gonna put your fears to bed
Cause heroes will never let you down just as long as they're dead

Sometimes you gotta pick and choose
Sometimes no matter what you lose

Nixon was a liar it's the one thing believed to be true
But Tricky Dick was not a crook whatever that means, whatever presidents do
Money can't buy you children and nothing can bring them back to you
We all make mistakes we all need someone to look up to

But who're you gonna call your fearless leader
Who's gonna put your fears to bed
Cause heroes will never let you down just as long as they're dead
