You don't have to worry 'bout a thing that the end of the world is coming
Just sit back and take it easy cause there ain't no use in running
This simple little pamphlet gives you prophets to believe in
And if I had the answers I would still believe, I'd still believe in

Hit the ground running
Run before they run you down
Get ready it's coming
Then another doomsday is done (doomsday is done
Another doomsday is done (doomsday is done)
But I'm hoping that you won't be disappointed at the end of the world don't come

On the banks of the Mississippi with a radio antenna crack pipe
If I were you and you were me do you think you could work this out right
It's a simple proposition just to get past a suspicion
And if I had my wishes I would wade in the wake of well they'd wish in

Hit the ground running
Run before they run you down
Get ready it's coming
Then another doomsday is done (doomsday is done)
Another doomsday is done (doomsday is done)
But I'm hoping that you won't be disappointed at the end of the world don't come

So have a drink and a smoke for me when you get to where you're going
I'll be just a-shootin' a breeze just as long as the wicked wind keeps blowing

Hit the ground running
Run before they run you down
Get ready it's coming
Then another doomsday is done (doomsday is done)
Another doomsday is done (doomsday is done)
But I'm hoping that you won't be disappointed at the end of the world don't come
