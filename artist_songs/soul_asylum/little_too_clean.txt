Thought I heard you screaming 
And pulling out your hair 
Furious and steaming, a state upon your stare 
Don't you know dirt will find you and 
Dirt reminds you that 
Dirt will always be there, it's only 
Dirt around you and dirt surrounds you and 
Follows you everywhere 
Here's a dirty joke, man, filled with filth and smut 
The heart of it, it sparkles, the more it can corrupt 
Don't you know, dirt can't hurt you 
I'm truly certain, usually washes out 
Don't you know, rain will wash out the 
Stain and all of your, pain will work itself out 
Work it out, 'fraid you've lost your innocence 
To some-odd social scene, you're right on top 
But you've been replaced, by a shiny new machine 
And dirt keeps following you, and you don't know what it means 
You're a little too clean, a little too clean, a little too clean 
One day dirt will bury you and you will understand 
There is nothing much more than the ground on which you stand 
Don't you know dirt will find you and 
Dirt reminds you that dirt will always be there 
It's only dirt around you and 
Dirt surrounds you and follows you everywhere 
'Fraid you've lost your innocence, to some-odd social scene 
You're right on top, but you've been replaced 
By a shiny new machine and dirt keeps following you 
And you don't know what it means, you're a little too clean 
A little too clean, a little too clean
