I may never get what I want
But I'm happy to just die trying
And I hope I ain't done nobody wrong
But I miss you smiling

And I'm looking for a cure 'cause I'm bored to tears
And I'm stuck in here, stuck out here, stuck in here

We lived through another day
It's a good excuse to celebrate
Take a number, knock on wood
We'll find a reason to feel good

I know, you know, I wanna know how I feel
I can't even tell
I can't even tell
I can't even tell

No one knows nothing about me
I'm guessing I'll just keep 'em guessing
No one sees what I see
This is my blessing

And I'm looking for a way to get out of here
Get me out of here, out of here, out of here

We lived through another day
It's a good excuse to celebrate
Take a number, knock on wood
Find a reason to feel good

I know, you know you wanna know how I feel 
I can't even tell
I can't even tell
I can't even tell

I'm out of here, out of here, out of here
I know, you know, I want to know how I feel
I can't tell

I know you know, I'll tell you if it's real
It sounded like a bell
I can't even tell
I can't even tell
