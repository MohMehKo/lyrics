Now you're mad and leaving home 
'Cause you say there's no one there for you to talk to 
Isn't it nice to go outside 
When you know there is no place you have to walk to 
You can live alone inside a crowded room 
And it's never, never too late, never too soon 
Put on your frown to go downtown 
You have come a long long way 
Even though you have no idea where you're going 
You ain't done a goddamn thing all afternoon 
Your confidence is sinking like a lead balloon 
And it's never, never too late, never too soon 
I can't come down I can't come down 
I can't come down I can't come down 
I can't go on I can't go on 
It's not like I'm asking you to hold up the sky 
All the things you held so high 
Are you surprised to find that now they add to nothing 
Now you're growing old and bored 
Do you think that maybe you could teach me something 
There is nothing that you really can assume 
And it's never, never too late, never too soon 
Now you're mad I know you're mad 
Now you're mad I know you're mad 
Why don't you just tell someone 
It's not like you're the only one 
It's not like I'm asking you to hold up the sky 
I can teach you how to drive 
You can teach me how to lie 
Hush my darling don't you cry 
This could be your lullaby
