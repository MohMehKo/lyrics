I ain't working nine to five
I ain't going out to plant no seed
I don't ask what I'm supposed to do, cause I've got everything I want
But I don't have anything I need

Well I do my thing in a palace full of kings
Do it in an old broken-down shack
I'd give you the shirt off my back, show you where your systems lack
Meet you in the lap of luxury

I get off the floor and walk it off
Get back to a place that I can see
Well I'm coming back for more abuse
Meet you in the lap.. the lap.. the lap of luxury

Now I'm working noon to midnight
Now my precious seeds they have been sown
I don't ask when they're supposed to grow 'cause I got everything I know
I don't know anything I need

No exploitation, paid vacation
All I want's communication
That ain't too hard to see

When the van stops rolling, the band starts rocking
It ain't too pretty, it ain't too shocking but
I've got everything I need

I get off the floor and walk it off
Get back to a place that I can see
Well I'm coming back for more abuse
Meet you in the lap of luxury
