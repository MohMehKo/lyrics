What is the matter with me?
It's always raining or snowing
It's stuck inside me somewhere
I don't know where I'm going

What about the tims, what about the drinks
What about the way, the way that we think
Now, I'm getting nowhere
I could get to know you, c'mon

Change, change of fortune
Right, right on time
If you got the fruit, I got the orchard
All the times I tortured you I could change your fortune too

What is the meaning of this insensitive violence?
What is it that you're asking
Is it nothing but silence?

What about the times, what about the kid
What about the things, the things that we did
Now, I'm getting nowhere
I could get to know you, c'mon

Change, change of fortune
Right, right on time
If you got the fruit, I've got the orchard
All the times I tortured you, I could change your fortune too

What is the meaning of this?
Is it getting us nowhere?

Change, change of fortune
Right, right on time
If you've got the fruit, I've got the orchard
All the times I tortured you, I could change your fortune too

Change, change of fortune
Right, right on time
If you've got the fruit, I've got the orchard
All the times I tortured you, I could change your fortune too

Change
