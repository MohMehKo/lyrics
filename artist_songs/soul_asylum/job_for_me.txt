Well I want to find a job that's right for me
Well anyone that could fool around is me
Well I just don't know what I'm gonna do
Well if I'm gonna ever have to work for you

Maybe I could be your bus driver
Maybe I could be your garbage man
Your part of this is what I deal with anyway
I'll try to find doin' what I can

Well I want to find a job that's right for me
Well I don't bother walkin' to a beat
Well I'll just do what I want to do
Well if I'm gonna always have to work for free

A janitor or a politician
All the different things you think you'd learn
And a lone raner, that would be fun
Havin' my silver bullets in my gun

I want to find a job that's right for me
I fell out of opportunity
Givin' out thoughts of purity
But you better be careful you'll be workin' for me

Maybe I could be your doctor
Go to school and get my PhD
Wonderin' if I'll ever make a livin'
Spellin' his own age, Jesus saves

Ohhh
