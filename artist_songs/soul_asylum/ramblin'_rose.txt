Love is like a ramblin' rose

The more you think, the more it grows

Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose

You try hard

Love is like a ranblin' rose

Cant think, but you can't let go

That thing for the more you know

You try hard

Try fuckin' hard

Love is like a ranblin' rose
Cant think, but you can't let go

Ramblin' rose
Ramblin' rose
Ramblin' rose
Ramblin' rose
Ramblin' rose
Ramblin' rose
Ramblin' rose
Ramblin' rose
