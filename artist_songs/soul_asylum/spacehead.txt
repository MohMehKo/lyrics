AAA So you think I got a problem
You think its all to clear
Got f*cking mental of disorder
Wheres the f*cking order around here?
I'm a spacehead I'm not a stupid head
I am a space head just open minded
Spacehead [x2]
Why when I cry do I hang my head down low?
How do you move so fast but think so slow?
??
I hang my head the way I let it flow
I'm a spacehead I'm not a stupid head
I am a space head just open my head
Dancin in theÂ ?light? and the teacher says I'm a space head
Smokin in the church and the preacher says I'm a space head
The books are burning fast [x2]
I bet you know just what I'm saying
Maybe I am saying something else
The next decision that you make is probably gonna be a big mistake
I'm a space head. Can I open up your head?
I'm a space head
I'm just open minded
Space head [x9 to a fade]
