Well my friend Jud he was a fuddy-dud 
Chewed his cud, was a stick in the mud 
I swear he hated everyone 
And he's bumming nickels and bumming dimes 
But most of all you know he's just bumming time 
And every day was a bad day 
They walked out and on and over him, he was turning gray 
Never knew love he gave up on hope 
Stayed in bed and he stopped using soap was a dirty old man 
But he never said poor little old me, poor poor 
Now one fine day he won the lottery 
Instant millionaire without a care it didn't change a thing 
Drove up to Reno he lost everything at a roadside casino 
You know he never made it into town 
Where the bright lights trickle down, he was a casualty 
And all he got was more lewd and crude, he was very rude 
The only thing he hated worse than the city 
Was charity and self pity he'd been around 
I talked to him that's what I found, he was a casualty 
Poor little old me, poor poor casualty
