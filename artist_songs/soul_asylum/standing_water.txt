Down from the mountain
Running wild through the trees
A crystal glimour,
rolling along so effortlessly. 

Trickled down from the country
But the city sucked it in and spit it out
Now the gravity pulls you
to the curb side now and it's getting light...

And it's too soon, too fast..
And now they're never gonna last...

Standing water,
standing to close to the sun
with your rainbow run-off,
you're like a sitting duck waiting for the summer rain to come.

I was at low-life in the hotlands,
I was barely living up to the standard undemands,
I had run out of reasons to let myself believe in anything,
I wanted to phone home so many times but I'm never giving in, 
you know dreams never die.
