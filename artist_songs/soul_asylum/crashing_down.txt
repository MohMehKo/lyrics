Dying on a bed of roses in the middle of the night
Woke up in a cold, dark basement looking through candlelights

Up all night, silly kid come crashing down (just one more taker)
Like a ghost of a thousand miles crawling over me

Here's to falling off the world's dark side
Drifted it alone on a morning's tide
Riding on an all-night train through a crystal gate
When the moonlight shines a path for a brighter day

When the ballrooms are all banging and the evening is so still
Could you see it in your heart to let me in?

Did he hand you the reigns of the morning news?
He lulled you asleep 'til the Aussie cat mews

When the leaves from the trees come crashing down (don't time pass slowly)
When the seasons don't change, they're spinning around

Here's to falling off the world's dark side
Drifted it alone on a morning's tide
Riding on an all-night train through a crystal gate
When the moonlight shines a path for a brighter day

When the ballrooms are all banging and the evening is so still
Could you see it in your heart to let me in?

Let me in
