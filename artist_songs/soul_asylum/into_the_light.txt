Once you’ve drawn the line, you can’t think twice
You would never take your own advice
Skating on a grave that’s paved with ice
You step into the light
How can I be sure if this is a sure thing
I’m so tangled up in puppeteers’ strings
Once you’ve crossed the line
You’re stepping into

Breaking horses, raising cain, heading for the hills
The best day ever just got better, it gets better still

Once you’ve crossed the line you can’t let go
Never go out, I have been alone
Skating on a grave that’s made of stone
You step into the light

You better be sure that this is a sure thing
As a puppet on a string
Once you’ve crossed the line
You’re stepping into

Breaking horses, raising cain, heading for the hills
The best day ever just got better, it gets better still

Once you’ve crossed the line, you can’t think twice
You’re looking out of

Chasing sirens, red lights change
No time left to kill
Waving flags of fine drawn lines
Find a cheaper thrill

This is a sure thing
Once you’ve crossed the line
You step into the light
You step into the light

Breaking horses, raising cain heading for the hills
The best day ever just got better, it gets better still

Waving flags of macho life (much of your life)
Find a cheaper plan
