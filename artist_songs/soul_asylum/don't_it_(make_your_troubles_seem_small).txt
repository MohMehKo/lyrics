You're talking like another mouth to feed
Shopping for things that you don't need
Smile, child, you're gonna be wild for a while

Fall, fall, fall, fall, fall waterfall
Di-di-di-di-di-di-dig my grave anytime at all
My friend punched another hole into the wall

Don't it make your troubles seem small?

And you're moaning and you're groaning
Everybody around you just makes you lonely
I'm trying to get to you, before you try to get to me

Fall, fall, fall fall, fall, fall
Di-di-di-di-di-di-dig my grave anywhere at all
Cockroaches try to crawling up my wall

Don't it make your troubles seem small?

Owww
Huh

Don't it make your troubles? Ohhhhh, ohhhh

Don't it make?
Don't it make?
Don't it make?
Don't it make?

Don't it?
Don't it?
Don't it?
Don't it?
Don't it?
Don't it?
