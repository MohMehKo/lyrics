[Radio DJ:]
"Mother Popcorn" by James [Brown].
Okay, umm, I wanted to ask you now, you just recently just changed your name to Soul Asylum,
and up until that point you were known as Loud fast Rules, right?

[Dave:] Oh, here it comes.

[DJ:] Okay, why? why did you, umm, like, why did you decide to ch-change the name of the band?

(Silence? then laughter from band.)

[DJ:] Don't.. don't all speak at once.

[Dan:] We're not an HC band.

[DJ:] Mmm-hmm.

[Karl:] I mean people would say we are, but I don't think we're a H?
ya know, hardcore band, a punk rock band, or new wave band.

[DJ:] Hmm? hmm, okay, but what about the name Soul Asylum? I mean, wouldn't.. don't you think that might stereotype you to some people like who hadn't not heard of you before, ya know, like to think that you were a soul or a funk band or something?

[Song fades in.]

[Dan:] It's possible.

[Dave:] I don't know.

[Karl:] But it's better than having everybody that doesn't know thinkin' you're hardcore.

[Dave:] I asked Paul and he said it wouldn't.

[Dan:] Paul; Paul Stark? A local god. A man who knows about all these things.

[Dave:] He knows everything.

[DJ:] Mmm-hmm. How did you come up with the name Soul Asylum? What is?

[Interview fades out.]

[Mecht Mensch:] We'd like to thank you all for coming down
To see the best band
And that just happens to be? Soul Asylum

Unfortunately, we're not them
