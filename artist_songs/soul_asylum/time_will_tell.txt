Sometimes in the morning
Like some kinda Cinderella story
Some kinda foreign movie
Where they just say
If you really wanna hurt me
You're gonna have to hold on
You know you really shoulda told me
It ain't like you been told on

Cuz only time will tell
Tell you what you wanna hear
Time will tell
Whispering right in your ear

[?] in a bottle
You believe anything you wanna
Really wanna believe
Whatever they told ya
You would just believe me
How many times I got to tell ya

Only time will tell
Tell you what you wanna hear
Time will tell
Whispering right in your ear

Take comfort in a good thing, hey
Take comfort in me
If you could have anything that you wanna
Could it be the best times I spent with you

If you really wanna push me
You're gonna have to hold on
If you really wanna see me
Like I wanna show ya

Only time will tell
Tell you what you wanna hear
Time will tell
Whispering right in your ear
Time will tell
Tell ya what ya wanna hear
Time will tell you, tell you what you wanna hear
Only time will tell
