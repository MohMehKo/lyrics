It's a mystery night
Like I sawed-off shotgun
In the morning light, it comes to anyone

All the strings that follow you...
And the things they're tied to
My love's behind you
Colored by the snow the shine is gone!

I used to know what made you wet
Now I'm searching for it
Cause It's a mystery all the same
Now to get you back...

On Holiday
With a broken camera
And all I say is 
"I could be happier!"

It's a mystery night
And I thought we had fun
But in the morning light
Your car's already gone

Do the things I want to do
Not the ones I'm supposed to
Why can't I get close to
The man I saw in me when I was young

On holiday with a broken camera!
And all I say is: "I could be happier"
And all I say is:
"I could be happier!"

I run away I'm free
From all the shadows that follow me
If all the branches are to break
Resolve my faith, destiny, and fate

Cause I never wanna go away tonight!
You're camera, you're camera!
I never wanna open up my eyes!
You're camera, you're camera!

You're camera, you're camera!

Cause I never wanna go away tonight!
I never wanna open up my eyes!
