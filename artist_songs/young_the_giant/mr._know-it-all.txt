Jack from school
He listened to Bowie
People thought he was cool
He used to live for the feel
Skating around up in the Hollywood Hills

But no one knows
He's talking it up
That it's all for show
He's boring as fuck

You're Mr. Know-It-All
She's staring at her phone
And even though you sit together
You feel so alone
It's such a tragedy
When people hardly speak
Try to live up to the person you pretend to be
You're Mr. Know-It-All
You're Mr. Know-It

Jill liked art
She listened to Mozart
People thought she was smart
She used to quote Hemingway
Trippin' on acid in the Palisades

But no one knows
That it's all for show

You're Mrs. Know-It-All
He's staring at his phone
And even though you sit together
You feel so alone
It's such a tragedy
When people hardly speak
Try to live up to the person you pretend to be

You must have known I tried to change
Would love to say hello
Please, don't hang up
Afraid of what I'd say
Hello, hello, hello
I'm Mr. Know-It-All

I'm Mr. Know-It-All
Staring at my phone
And even though we sit together
I feel so alone
It's such a tragedy
We always used to speak
Try to live up to the person I pretend to be
I'm Mr. Know-It
