People
In the middle
Life's a riddle
Not a game of dice...
Not for a man who rolls with ice

Days turn
Faster than a minute
How was I to know this?
Would you even notice me?
Cause they're imposters
We threw away the time!

Anagram
I'm just the messenger, man
It's the last
Time around
One of these days I wished you were around
Anagram
If we're just passengers
Then it's the first
Time around
One of these days I wished you were around!

All the people
In white stockings
Talk with pride
They'll be waving all the flags at night
Which will I decide?
Cause they're imposters...
I'm making up my mind

Anagram
I'm just the messenger, man
It's the last
Time around
One of these days I wished you were around
Anagram
If we're just passengers
Then it's the first
Time around
One of these days I wished you were around!

Glide!
I stand in the light of your eyes
I'll see you another time
Come on baby roll the dice
I'm feeling like it's gonna break
This time will stars align?
I'm thinking that it's all the same

Anagram
I'm just the messenger, man
It's the last
Time around
One of these days I wished you were around
Anagram
If we're just passengers
Then it's the first
Time around
One of these days I wished you were around!

Anagram!
Anagram!
