Teachers
They tried to reach you
They said, "It's who you know."
But now you've grown up
And it's time
You were tested
This city made you cold and
Only when you're fucked up

Do you miss the friends?
The names you crossed off

And I know it's hard to be sane
Temptation is so friendly
I need this release now
I'll find the keys to free me!

I awake in a parking lot
Where are all the friends?
The names I crossed off?

Won't you ask me,
"Are you in love with the city?
All the stars;
Whiskey bars?"

And I'm on my back I'm waiting
Yeah you could say that I'm praying

Will I remember
Where I misplaced you?

And I know it's hard to be sane
Temptation is so friendly
(You'll come back
To see it
The fever
You feel it!)
I need this release now
I'll find the keys to free me!

I'm awake
In a car
Hollywood
Boulevard
Is this who you are?

Oh!
Run now!
Run now!

I need this release now
I'll find the keys to free me!
