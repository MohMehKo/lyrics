It's all in frame
Familiar faces on my wall
This town is strange
Seasons never change
Time is up
The war doesn't stop for anyone
Until the sun dissolves

We all disappear
There's nothing to fear, now my love
How does it feel?

It's over, nothing's over
I'll grow up when I'm older
God only knows what I would do to you
It's over, nothing's over
I'll grow up when I'm older
God only knows what I would do to you

It's over, nothing's over
I'll grow up when I'm older
God only knows what I would do to you
It's over, nothing's over
I'll grow up when I'm older
God only knows what I would do to you

It's over, nothing's over
I'll grow up when I'm older
God only knows what I would do to you
It's over, nothing's over
I'll grow up when I'm older
God only knows what I would do to you
