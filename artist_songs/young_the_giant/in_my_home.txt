Hey Hey Hey!

Ya we sleep in cars
Oh so far from home
Watch the sun go down
On the open road
I've been searching for this
All of my life

Then the sun will rise
We'll be driving slow!
Watch the kids fly by
On their telephones
I've been racing all my life
And now I'm free

Oh I know I was born for this
Every night I dreamt of it
In my home! In my home!

Fast the moon approaches
And with hungry eyes
We'll be lighting torches
We'll be mesmerized!
I've been burning for this
Cover of night

When the stars come out, kill the stereo
Where we going dear?
I don't know

Oh I know I was born for this
Every night I dreamt of it
In my home! In my home 
And we are not lost
We're just searching; we are always, always searching for!
(Home!)

We'll be going, dear, in bright lights
I don't know, I fear I'm paralyzed
I'm paralyzed

In my home! In my home
And we are not lost
We're just searching; we are always, always searching for!
(Home!)
