Here it goes
Chemical is on its way
And my box is packed
Or should I stay?

It's coming (it's coming)...
We can analyze; philosophize
But who's to say?

All we know is
We're here today
Look in my eyes!

This is just the reason why I stayed
I know there are things we shouldn't...
Say
Blame it on the reason why I came
Maybe cuz I couldn't feel the
Pain!

Fight the fear
Taste the grip
Feel the slip
Shake the soul
Feel the waves
In and out and in and out and in and out...
Look in my eyes...

This is just the reason why I stayed
I know there are things we shouldn't...
Say
Blame it on the reason why I came
Maybe cuz I couldn't feel the
Pain!

a. Feel the weight wash away
All the mistakes I've made
b. Live in a time all my own
Tearing the soul from bone
c. Letting the tide suck me in
and chemicals bursting
d. These are my only friends
Living in waves until the end
