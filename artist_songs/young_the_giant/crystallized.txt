Crawl back to life
It's been far too long
Crystallized
Round interstellar moons
Speed of light
Into your atmosphere
What's your world like?
Is the house we built still here?
Girl you know...

When the beat of my drum
Meets the beat of your heart
You'll know I couldn't love
Any other Any other
This is where I come from
This is where I belong
With the beat of your drum
Not any other

Fall through the sky
Little specks below
Magnify
The further down I go
I feel it in my bones
Can you feel it too?
Is this the world I've known?
Is the house we built still here?
Is the human race sincere?

When the beat of my drum
Meets the beat of your heart
You'll know I couldn't love
Any other Any other
This is where I come from
This is where I belong
With the beat of your drum
Not any other

Feel the force of time
Weighing down my mind
Tears you've cried
Screaming at the sky
Come outside
The rays are shining bright

Oh-Oh!

Not any other!
Where I come from!
Where I belong! 

When the beat of my drum
Meets the beat of your heart
You'll know I couldn't love
Any other Any other
This is where I come from
This is where I belong
With the beat of your drum
Not any other
