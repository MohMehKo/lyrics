It's a full moon at Midnight
Running fast
Out of time
It's a feeling you can't describe
Floating past
A pale skyline
And here you look reflective
But you're so disconnected
Just think about it!
What's really on your mind?
And for you I would steal time
(suspicion, suspicion)!

You're a daydreamer 
And it's the same thing
O-ver and over!
We're running for our lives
In a slipstream!
You'll wake up someday
And realize you were
Dreaming of a life
You'll forget!

It's so affected,
That color corrected night
But you're falling fast
Through plastic skies
And here you look reflective
So disconnected
It's not real life 
Open your eyes and breathe
Everything's in its right place
But nothing gold can stay
Just tell me you know my face!

You're a daydreamer 
And it's the same thing
O-ver and over!
We're running for our lives
In a slipstream!
You'll wake up someday
And realize you were
Dreaming of a life
You'll forget!... 
When the moon was high...
You couldn't describe
Oh, lucid sky!

We just might die
But we feel so alive!

You're a daydreamer 
And it's the same thing
O-ver and over!
We're running for our lives

In a slipstream!
You'll wake up someday
And realize you were
Dreaming up a life
You forget!
