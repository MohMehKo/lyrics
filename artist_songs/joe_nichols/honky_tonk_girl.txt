She moved up to the city
Became a big time fashion designer
All them big shots wined and dined her
In those fancy restaurants
She cam back to our hometown
Pulled up in a brand new Lexus
Looks like our little girl from Texas
Had joined the upper echelon

And she walked through the door
In her jeans and her boots
Stepped right back
Into her tonkin' roots
'Neath the neon lights
We raised the roof
Way into the night
Now you can take the girl out of the honky tonk
Into that uptown world
But she's still my little good timin', beer drinkin', pool shootin'
Honk tonk girl

Once upon another time
Before she moved to the Big Apple
Wedding bells were gonna ring in a country chapel
For me and my down-home debutante
Said she missed what we had
And though she made a darn good livin'
Money couldn't buy what she'd been missin'
Yeah, that girl knows what she wants

And she walked through the door
In her jeans and her boots
Stepped right back
Into her tonkin' roots
'Neath the neon lights
We raised the roof
Way into the night
Now you can take the girl out of the honky tonk
Into that uptown world
But she's still my little good timin', beer drinkin', pool shootin'
Honk tonk girl

Well, you can take the girl out of the honky tonk
Into that uptown world
But she's still my little good timin', beer drinkin', pool shootin'
Honk tonk girl
