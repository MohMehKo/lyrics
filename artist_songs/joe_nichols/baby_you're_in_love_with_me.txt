I got some money, I got some gasoline
Filling up my tank
We got the whole night, honey we can roll right
Down by the river bank
Roll your pretty eyes
But girl you're gonna find tonight we were meant to be
Sailin' this Chevy
Down by the levee like a ship through the deep blue sea

So come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Wherever the moment leads
Come on (come on)
Come on admit it
Baby you're in love with me

I'm gonna prove it, turn up the music
This is where you take my hand
Dancing in the headlights, cut us a rug
From here to the promised land
You can let go, let your hair down
You can be you with me
I caught you smiling, ain't no denying
This is where you wanna be

So come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Wherever the moment leads
Come on (come on)
Come on admit it
Baby you're in love with me

Yea come on (come on baby)
Come on
Wherever the moment leads
Come on
Come on admit it
Baby you're in love with me
Come on, come on
Girl, come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Wherever the moment leads
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Baby you're in love with me
Baby you're in love with me
