Don't ruin it for the rest of us
With your braggin that you fell in love
Can't you see we're kinda busy here
Swappin' lies and cryin' in our beers
So you're getting married good for you
It's first innin Braves are down by two
Grab a seat and keep your big mouth shut
And on't ruin it for the rest of us

I hardly recognized you
With that smile on your face
Your shirt's tucked in, you shaved your chin
and every hair's in place
you smell a whole lot better
Than anybody in this bar
Here's a dollar, buy yourself a cheap cigar

Don't ruin it for the rest of us
With your braggin' that you fell in love
Can't you see we're kinda busy here
Swappin' lies and cryin' in our beers
So you're gettin married good for you
It's third innin Braves are down by two
Grab a seat and keep your big mouth shut
And don't ruin it for the rest of us

You missed bowling season
Butch blew a perfect game
And when we got the new shirts printed up
There was an "I" in Shooter's name
Well Ronnie's back to walkin'
He got another DUI
So if you plan on gettin out of here alive

Don't ruin it for the rest of us
With your braggin' that you fell in love
Can't you see we're kinda busy here
Swappin' lies and cryin' in our beers
So you're gettin married good for you
It's sixth inning Braves are down by two
Grab a seat and keep your big mouth shut
And don't ruin it for the rest of us

So you're getting married good for you
It's ninth innin we're about to lose
I told you twice to keep your pie hole shut
And don't ruin it for the rest of us
Can't you see that we've been through enough
Don't ruin it for the rest of us
