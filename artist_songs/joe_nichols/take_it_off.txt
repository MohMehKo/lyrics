If you're feelin that summer time heat
Got the top up on your jeep
Take it off, go on now take it off.
Got your boat up on the trailer
back it down in a river, take it off
Go on, now take it off.

[Chorus:]
If the weight world's on your shoulders
Got a week of worries on your mind
Go on, do what you wanna do
Soak you up a little sunshine, 
Dig your hand down in a cooler 
grab a cold one and twist the top, 
Take it off, yeah take it off.

You're a pretty little country thing
bikini under them cut off jeans, take them off
Come on mama take them off
Those sunglasses on your head
anything you donâ€™t want to get wet
better take em off, jump in and take em off

[Chorus:]
If the weight of the world's on your shoulders
Got a week of worries on your mind
Go on, do what you wanna do
Soak you up a little sunshine, 
Dig your hand down in a cooler 
grab a cold one and twist the top, 
Take it off
Na na na na na uh uh uh
Na na na na na 

We can go fishing in the full moonlight
If you get one on line I'll take it off, 
girl I'll help you take it off.
Got a blanket we can crawl underneath
If it gets too hot to sleep
We can take it off, baby we can take it off

[Chorus:]

Na na na na na uh uh uh
Na na na na na 
Take it off
Baby, take it off
We can take it off.
