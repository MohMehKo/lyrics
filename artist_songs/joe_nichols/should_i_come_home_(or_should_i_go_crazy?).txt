I wonder if you've had the time it takes,
To think it over.
To sort out all the feelins in your mind,
Sometimes I think you found someone
To do your thinkin' for ya, cause
Lately you've been showin' all the signs.

Should I come home,
Or should I go crazy.
I'm beggin' you please,
Make up your mind.
If you love me,
Than think it all over. 
So make up your mind,
Or I'll lose mine.

Last night when I came by
I rang the bell,
And no one answered
But I heard voices whispered 
Through the door,
Now I'm not sure if anyone was home
To do the talkin',
Cause lately I hear voices more and more.

Should I come home,
Or should I go crazy.
I'm beggin' you please,
Make up your mind
If you love me
Than think it all over.
So make up your mind,
Or i'll lose mine.

Should i come home,
Or should i go crazy
I'm beggin' you please,
Make up your mind.
If you love me, 
Than think it all over
So make up your mind
Or i'll lose mine...

(Should i come home or should i go crazy)
