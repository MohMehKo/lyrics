Its been one of those days
Hell one of those weeks
Boss man wont cut me no slack, Jack
Did just what he said
He just shook his head
And still crawled all up on my back

I been bitin' my tongue
Keepin' my cool
But I'm hot fightin' mad
Ain't but one thing to do...

Open up a can
Pop a top, feel the cold in my hand
Hit the deck and cut on the box fan
Sittin' here sippin', all the stress man forget it
Cause there's only so much you can stand
Fore' ya open up a can

Sometimes its a driver, cuttin' me off
Some politic talk on TV
When my team drops a pass
My blood rises fast 
And I need to take it down a few degrees

Open up a can
Pop a top, feel the cold in my hand
And I'm back in the high life again
Sittin' here sippin', all the stress man forget it
Cause there's only so much you can stand
Fore' ya open up a can
Or two, maybe one too many
Cause that's all it takes 
To keep the world spinnin' just right

Open up a can
Pop a top, feel the cold in my hand
Pretend I got my toes in the sand
Sittin' here sippin', all the stress man forget it
Cause there's only so much you can stand
Fore' ya open up a can

Ice cold can

Open up a can [x2]
