I've got a number on a napkin
A pounding in my head
It takes everything I've got
To crawl out of bed

I lost a hell of a woman
Freedom coked me on the chin
But I'm doing alright
For the shape I'm in

The sun came up again this morning
I got a call from a long lost friend
Planed this little road trip down in New Orleans
It ain't much but it beats where I've been

Yeah, I'm doing alright
I'm doing alright
I'm doing alright
For the shape I'm in, yeah

Well, I'm getting better
At barely getting by
When I look at her picture
I don't break down and cry

And all this time on my hands
It's getting easier to spend
'Cause I'm doing alright
For the shape I'm in

The sun came up again this morning
And took my own past back for a spin
Now it had rained, it ain't always pouring
And I'm learning how to live again

Yeah, I'm doing alright
I'm doing alright
I'm doing alright
For the shape I'm in

Yeah, I'm doing alright
Yes, I'm doing alright
Yeah, I'm doing alright
For the shape I'm in

Yes, I'm doing alright
Yeah, I'm doing alright
Yeah, I'm doing alright
For the shape I'm in
