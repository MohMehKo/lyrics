You can hear that rag-top humming down the blacktop
Anytime night or day
Well she keeps her motor running and her tops down sunning
The girl she's got her ways
I said the wind blows through her hair and she ain't got a care
In this old weary world
Well i guess you could say that in her own way
She's an independent girl

She don't care about diamonds
She don't care about pearls
She's an anti-innocent, self sufficient, independent girl
She said her daddy was a miner and mama was a shiner
And she too had her ways
But he went blind and lost his mind
She drove him to and early grave
Well if she comes to your town motors running top down
Careful she can change your world
Just let me tell you boy
She's an independent girl
