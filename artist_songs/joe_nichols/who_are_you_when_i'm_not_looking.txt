My, oh, my, you're so good looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all you're cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking

Do you pour a little something on the rocks
Slide down the hallway in your socks
When you undress, do you leave a path
Then sing through your nose in a bubble bath

My, oh, my, you're so good looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all you're cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking

I want to know, I want to know, I want to know

Do you break things when you get mad
Eat a box of chocolate cause you're feeling bad
Do you paint your toes cause you bite your nails
And call up mama when all else fails

Who are you when I'm not around
When the door is locked and the shades are down
Do you listen to your music quietly
And when it feels just right or you're thinking of me

I want to know, I want to know, I want to know

My, oh, my, you're so good looking
But who are you when I'm not looking
