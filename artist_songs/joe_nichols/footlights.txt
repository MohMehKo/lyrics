I live the kinda life
Most men only dream of
I make my livin' writing songs
And singin' them
But I'm 31 years old
And I ain't got no place to go, when it's over
So I'll hide my age and make the stage tonight
Try to kick the footlights out again

I'll throw my old guitar
Across the stage and then my bass man takes a bone
And the crowd goes nearly wild
To see my guitar nearly fall
After 20 years of pickin'
I'm still alive and kickin' down the walls
And tonight I'll kick the footlights out and
Walk away without a curtain call

Yea tonight I'm gonna kick the footlights out again
And I'll try to hide the mood I'm really in
Might not put on my old instamatic grin
Yea tonight I'm gonna kick the footlights out again
And again

I live the kinda life
Most men only dream of
I make my livin' writing songs
And singin' them
But I'm 30 some years old
And I ain't got no place to go, when it's over
So I'll hide my age and make the stage tonight
Try to kick the footlights out again
