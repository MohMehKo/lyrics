She's such a beautiful handful
Might be more than I can handle
She's a wild child running down a Friday night
Got me wrapped around her finger and holding on tight

She's so hot, hey, what's not to love
Heaven's little devil's got me all messed up
She's a little heart breaker, and I'm her fool
She's so hot, it's hard to be cool
Hard to be cool

She's like a ten, but better
She leads me on, but I let her
Might be a spring fling heartache headed my way
And I may be crazy, but all I can say is

She's so hot, hey, what's not to love
Heaven's little devil's got me all messed up
She's a little heart breaker, and I'm her fool
She's so hot, it's hard to be cool
Hard to be cool

And I ain't never seen anything like her
In that sexy little sundress, man, she's on fire

She's so hot
Mmm, yeah, she's hot, son

She's so hot, hey, what's not to love
Heaven's little devil's got me all messed up
She's a little heart breaker, and I'm her fool
She's so hot, it's hard to be cool
Yeah, it's hard to be cool

Yeah, it's hard to be cool
She's so hot
