From time to time,
I'll meet the boys for one or two rounds
But I don't mind,
Lettin' somebody else close the bar down.
Most of my wilder days have come and gone
But there's one habit I'm still dependin' on

Your love is the good kind of habit
I'm gonna keep on to the day that I die
I'm just tryin' to drink it all up
I'm never gonna get enough.
So go on fill it up to the top
I'll take all the hugs and the kisses you got
When it comes to your sweet love
I'm never gonna get enough.

Jack and Coke,
And I'm sure to say something I'll regret.
Jose Cuervo,
And I could wind up in my old truck bed.
So when I need a little something now
To pick me up and not let me down

Your love is the good kind of habit
I'm gonna keep on to the day that I die
I'm just tryin' to drink it all up
I'm never gonna get enough.
So go on fill it up to the top
I'll take all the hugs and the kisses you got
When it comes to your sweet love
I'm never gonna get enough.

So go on fill it up to the top
I'll take all the hugs and the kisses you got
When it comes to your sweet love
I'm never gonna get enough.
