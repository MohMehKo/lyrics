Do I pick you up
Do I meet you out
Are you a girl that stays home
Or do you like a big crowd

It's that midnight kiss
That knock my train off track
Well I've been waiting on another one just like that

Tell me what I gotta do
To get your smile on mine
Get you back in my arms
Later on tonight

How bout a table for two
How bout a bottle of wine
Tell me what I gotta do 
To get your smile on mine

Well are you kinda like me
Sick and tired of this town
How bout we jump in my truck
and ride just around

Tell me what I gotta do
To get your smile on mine
Get you back in my arms
Later on tonight

How bout a table for two
How bout a bottle of wine
Tell me what I gotta do 
To get your smile on mine

Don't play hard to get
Girl it just ain't fair
Don't you remember that night
there was magic in the air

Tell me what I gotta do
To get your smile on mine
Get you back in my arms
Later on tonight

How bout a table for two
How bout a bottle of wine
Tell me what I gotta do 
To get your smile on mine
...on mine

Tell me what I gotta do 
To get your smile on mine
