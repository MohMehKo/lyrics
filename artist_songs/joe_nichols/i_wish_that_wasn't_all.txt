"I'm Not Stranger To The Rain" came on my radio today
I hadn't heard that voice in way too long
I've still got those worn out tapes
The only three or four he made, what a shame
I wish that wasn't all

Hearin' that song took me back to my senior year
The year I asked Mary Ellen Mayfield to the prom
She agreed to go as friends, and I remember thinkin',
"man i wish, Lord, I wish that wasn't all"

Ain't it funny how sometimes we can be unsatisfied
With things we should be thankful for
Like an old Keith Whitley song or a slow dance at the senior prom
Some things just leave you wantin' more

Like the way I felt that June when Dad called me withthe news
Through the tears, he told me my grand dad was gone
He lived til' he was ninety-five, I know that's a goodlong life
Still I wish, Lord, I wish that wasn't all

Ain't it funny how sometimes we can be unsatisfied
With things we should be thankful for
Like the time we get to spend with the ones we love, family and friends
Some things just leave you wantin' more

I thank God that i found you
Until now i never knew
That love could be this strong
I could stay right here and hold you close for ten forevers in a row
Still i'd wish, i'd wish that wasn't all
Yeah I wish, Lord, I wish that wasn't all
