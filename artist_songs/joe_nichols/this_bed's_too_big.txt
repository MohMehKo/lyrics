Baby this bed’s too big.
We don’t need all this room.
I like you nice and close.
Cause heaven knows, morning comes too soon.

You hear the rain outside.
Soft as a serenade.
If there was candlelight
I would swear this night was custom made.

Every now and then,
You gotta take some time
To stop and reconnect
and let the world go by.
Everything can wait except the way we feel.
And I feel like kissing you, holding you, lovin you
More than anything that’s what I want to do.

Baby it’s only fair
Both of us work so hard
Would it really be a crime
If we both took some time
To be heart to heart.

Every now and then
We’ve gotta take some time
To stop and reconnect
And let the world go by.
Everything can wait except the way we feel.
And I feel like kissing you, holding you, lovin you
More than anything that’s what I want to do.

Baby this bed’s too big.
We don’t need all this room.
I like you nice and close.
Cause heaven knows, morning comes too soon.
