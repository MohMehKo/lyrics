I'm a solitary man, 
Nothing means more than my freedom,
A few days ago I swear
I walked out of there believen
I could let you go

I know how freedom feels
I've heard that sound beneath my wheels,
Nothin or no one could slow me down
But since I told you good-bye
Something just ain't right
Freedom feels like lonely tonight

Out on this open road
Any where I wanna go is waitin
All I can think about
Is turnin' this old truck around and takin',
That road back to you

I know how freedom feels
I've heard that sound beneath my wheels
Nothin' or no one to slow me down, 
But since I told you good-bye
Something just ain't right
Freedom feels like lonely tonight

Yeah since I told you good-bye
I miss you all the time
Freedom feels like lonely tonight
Yeah freedom feels like lonely tonight...
