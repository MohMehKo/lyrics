Have you ever seen a river ragin' in the spring
Rushin' down a mountain fast as anything
Well, if you can picture that wild water
That would be her, only deeper
Have you ever seen an eagle soring high above the trees
Circling the world below the epitome of free
Then you could imagine how i feel when I'm beside her
Only higher

I'm flying, I'm falling, I'm floating
And all i want to do is hold her
Closer and spend every day that passes
Thinkin' up new ways to love her more

If you've never had a vision
Of what a perfect love would be
just close your eyes and dream a dream
that just gets sweeter, an' that would be her

Of what a perfect love would be

That just gets sweeter, an' that would be her
