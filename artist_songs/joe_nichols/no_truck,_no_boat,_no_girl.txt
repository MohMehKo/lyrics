Sun-burned and wonderin', how I wound up here
Edge of a dock, one flip flop, half of a six-pack of beer
Seems like yesterday I was sittin' on top of the world
And I watched it all just drive away
No truck, no boat, no girl.

Layin' out there on that water, is where we ought to be
Instead I'm stuck with no ride home and no you here with me
Seems like yesterday I was sittin' on top of the world
All it takes is one mistake,
No truck, no boat, no girl.

If I could I'd drive a line and catch a bite to eat
Put my zip-code in my tackle box [?]
[x2]

The water's turnin' smooth as glass, the sun is goin' down
A red sea regal's blowin' by makin' one last lap around
Seems like yesterday I was sittin' on top of the world
I'm just bobbin' in the wake
No truck, no boat, no girl.

Seems like yesterday I was sittin' on top of the world
Man ain't meant to live this way
No truck, no boat, no girl.
Some things just can't be replaced
No truck, no boat, no girl.
