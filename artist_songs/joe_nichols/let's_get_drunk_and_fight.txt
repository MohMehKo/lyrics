Let me pour you a tall one
Come sit down next to me
Baby, you look so damn good
In those faded jeans

Well, I've been stoned cold sober
You've been cold as ice
Hey, I got a good idea
Let's get drunk and fight

Let's get drunk and fight
We'll keep the neighbors up all night
Now you can scream at me
And I'll make you cry

And when the morning comes
We'll make some make up love
While we apologize
But tonight, let's get drunk and fight

Have another Pina Colada
And get good and torqued down
If you need a pi√±ata
Well, you can kick me around

You can insult my mother
And I'll question your past
It turns me on when you're pissed off
You look hot when you're mad

Let's get drunk and fight
Keep the neighbors up all night
Now you can scream at me
And I'll make you cry

And when the morning comes
We'll make make up love
While we apologize
But tonight, let's get drunk and fight

Yeah, let's get drunk and fight
And keep the neighbors up all night
You can scream at me
Oh, I'm gonna make you cry

When the morning comes
We'll make make up love
While we apologize
But tonight, let's get drunk and fight
Yeah baby, just tonight, let's get drunk and fight
