I was just plannin' on comin' in here for one beer
Maybe shoot a little pool, shoot the bull and get outta here
But you walked in in that little dress and my eyes about popped outta my head
Took me a minute to catch my breath and I can't stop starin' at you

The more I look, the more I like
The more I wanna take you home tonight
The more that I don't want this night to end
The more you talk, the more I listen
The more I'm thinkin' 'bout me kissin' you
Holdin' that rockin' body close to mine
The more I look, the more I look, the more I like

Well here we are and the clocks are knockin' on midnight
I got twenty bucks left down to drink the bar out of Bud Light
If you wanna go another round, there's a dusty dirt road that we can roll down
To the Blue Hole a couple miles outta town
Baby we can go right now

The more I look, the more I like
The more I wanna take you home tonight
The more that I don't want this night to end
The more you talk, the more I listen
The more I'm thinkin' 'bout me kissin' you
Holdin' that rockin' body close to mine
The more I look, the more I look, the more I like

A little while we'll just find in that look in your eyes,
Says you might wanna jump on in
Well I don't mind, that will be just fine,
I wanna see that moonlight in your skin

The more I look, the more I like
The more I wanna take you home tonight
The more that I don't want this night to end
The more you talk, the more I listen
The more I'm thinkin' 'bout me kissin' you
Holdin' that rockin' body close to mine
The more I look, the more I look, the more I like
Yeah, the more I look, the more I look, the more I like
