I was sittin' outside in the front yard
Lawn chair, kiddie pool, soakin' up the sun
Old man walks by and said, "We got this thing called ambition
Why don't you buy a suit and go get you some?"

Like he ain't got enough of his own business
Now he's got to go mindin' mine
Opportunity knocks and I miss it

It ain't no crime, it ain't no crime
If I wanna kick back and kill a little time
It ain't no crime

I was gettin' some pink in my color
Next door the lady says, "Why you always layin' around?
A fine you man like you should be married with some children
Instead of all these honeys runnin' in and out"

Like she ain't got enough of her own business
Now she's got to go mindin' mine
I don't have a lotta kids and a Mrs.

It ain't no crime, it ain't no crime
If I wanna kick back and steal a kiss sometime
It ain't no crime

If everybody minded their own business
They'd be too busy to worry 'bout mine
If I live life the way I wanna live it

It ain't no crime, it ain't no crime
If I wanna kick back and chill
Or steal a kiss from a girl I will every time
It ain't no crime, it ain't no crime, it ain't no crime
