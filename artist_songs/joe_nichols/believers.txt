Outside the courthouse on 5th and vine
There's a hundred people holdin' up their homemade signs
They say they'll be there sunshine or rain
'Til somebody listens, 'til somethin's changed

Believers, believers
They gotta little more faith than the world has doubt
The earth might shake but they stand their ground
And God only knows where we'd be without believers

They were a couple o' kids with cheap weddin' bands
They didn't have nothin' but big ole plans
Thirty five years later, they're still goin' strong
Aw but they're not surprised, they knew it all along

Believers, believers
They gotta little more faith than the world has doubt
The earth might shake but they stand their ground
And God only knows where we'd be without believers

Eighty nine years old and a momma still prays
That her wayward son will find his way
There's a telephone call that makes her cry
It's her son sayin', momma, I've seen the light
Everybody told her she was wastin' her time

Believers, believers
They gotta little more faith than the world has doubt
The earth might shake but they stand their ground
And God only knows where we'd be without, without believers, believers
