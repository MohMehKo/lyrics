I'm gonna tell her that I love her
About a million times a day
Oh I'm gonna do
Everything I wouldn't do
I'm gonna straighten up my act
If I ever get her back

I'm gonna break these old habits
Just like I broke her heart
It took her walking out
For me to figure out
How to keep our love on track

If I ever get her
Back in these arms
Right where she belongs
I'll hold her near
Dry the tears and make her laugh
If I ever get her back

She'll be my every reason
And I'll bend so we don't break
I'll give her all my time
Take time to read her mind
She won't even have to ask

If I ever get her
Back in these arms
Right where she belongs
I'll hold her near
Dry those tears and make her laugh
If I ever get her back in these arms
Right where she belongs
I'll hold her near
Dry her tears and make her laugh
If I ever get her back

I'm gonna tell her that I love her
