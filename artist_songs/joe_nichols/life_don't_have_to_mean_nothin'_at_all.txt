Now if you wanna be happy
Let me tell you how to do it
You get up in the mornin' and you get right to it
Ya bring home the bacon
And you make a little bread
Ya get a little sleep then ya go back to bed
Life don't have to mean nothin' at all

If everybody says you're a little too tall
Go out and get yourself a basketball
Die your hair orange
And put a ring in your ear
And you could make fourty-seven million dollars a year
Life don't have to mean nothin' at all

If everybody says you're a little too short
Go out and get yourself a big ol' horse
you could be a jockey if ya got no fear
And you could make fourty-seven million dollars a year
Life don't have to mean nothin' at all

Life don't have to mean nothin' at all
Be good to your sister n' good to your brother
Good to your papa and good to your mother
Life don't have to mean nothin' at all

Now if you're a conman lookin' for a pigeon
Go out and start a brand new religion
Get on t.v. and make a money request
And they can all go to heaven while you're starvin' to death
Life don't have to mean nothin' at all
Now if everybody says you're a little too rough
Go out and get yourself some boxin' gloves
Beat somebody up around the ears
And you could make fourty-seven million dollars a year
Life don't have to mean nothin' at all

Life don't have to mean nothin' at all
Be good to your sister n' good to your brother
Might even try to be good to one another
Life don't have to mean nothin' at all

Now if everybody says you're a little too slick
Get yourself into politics
Get that office n' get that power
And you could spend fourty-seven million dollars and hour
Life don't have to mean nothin' at all

Now if you can pick a guitar
And sing through your nose
Get yourself a bunch of cowboy clothes
Sing about dyin' and sheddin' them tears
And you could lose fourty-seven million dollars a year
Life don't have to mean nothin' at all

Life don't have to mean nothin' at all
Don't trouble your mind and worry your soul
'Bout stuff you ain't supposed to know
Life don't have to mean nothin' at all
No life don't have to mean nothin' at all
