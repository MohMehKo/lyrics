His daddy taught him all about huntin' and fishin'
How to work on that old truck when it needed fixin'
How to say sir and how to say mam
How there ain't nothing wrong with getting dirt on your hands

Have mercy on all of the kids out there
Who haven't been raised to even care
About things like that these days

His momma used to cook every meal in the kitchen
She helped with his homework and taught him religion
SHe laid down the law and he let her know
Where he was going and when he'd be home

Have mercy on all of the kids out there
Who haven't been raised to even care
About things like that these days

As the years changed him from a boy to a man
He was blessed with a generous heart and a plan
Where ever life takes him wherever he's at
He's gonna find some way to give somthing back

Now his weekends are spent doing what he loves most
With 12 little angels who call him coach
Some have nothing an dsome are spoiled rotten
But when they're with him they're not forgotten

Have mercy on all of the parents out there
Who haven't been raised to even care
About things liek tat these days

As the years changed him from a boy to a man
He was blessed with agenerous heart and a plan
Wherever life takes him wherever he's at
He's gonna find some way to give something back

Have mercy on all of the kids out there
Who haven't been raised to even care
About things like that these days

Have mercy on all of the kids out there
Who haven't been raised to even care
About things like that these days
