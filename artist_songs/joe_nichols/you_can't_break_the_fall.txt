You think you're smart
You think you're smooth
You think that love can't get its hands on you

I'm living proof
A man ain't that strong
You got no choice when the right one comes along

'Cause you can't run
And you can't hide
When love's got you in its sites
You might as well give up the fight
When it calls
'Cause you can't break the fall

You say it's got no chance
You make no mistakes
'Cause you've been close to the edge before and walked away

But your day's commin'
Don't kid yourself
And when it comes you'll be down before you know you fell

'Cause you can't run
And you can't hide
When love's got you in its sites
You might as well give up the fight
When it calls
'Cause you can't break the fall

'Cause you can't run
And you can't hide
When love's got you in its sites
You might as well give up the fight
When it callse
'Cause you can't break the fall
