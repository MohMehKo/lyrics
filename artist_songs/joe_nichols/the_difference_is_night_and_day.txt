Lately I've seen every sunrise
Driving down the Interstate
On my way to be the first one
Through the factory gate
It didn't used to be like this
The difference is night and day

I used to count the minutes
??
I couldn't wait to punch that card
And leave this place behind
But now when the whistle blows
Oh, the difference is night and day

'Cause it means I'll have to head on home
And spend another night alone
Counting memories that you left behind
And here in, in the kitchen drawer left
Shirt of mine you always wore
Something always takes me back in time

Weekends I could fish
Or catch a ball game with the guys
Anything to get me out
Of this house for awhile
But the minute I go home
Oh, the difference is night and day

As long as I don't have to see
All those things reminding me
I can tell myself I'm moving on
But as soon as I walk through that door
I know that I'll find something more
It shows me just how far I've really gone

Maybe I'll get lucky and get some sleep tonight
Either way I'm outta here as soon as it gets light
Outside these four walls
The difference is night and day
No, it didn't used to be like this
The difference is night and day
