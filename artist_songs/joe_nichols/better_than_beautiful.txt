You came along it was perfect timing for me
Yeah you dropped right in the puzzle like a missing piece
It took awhile for me to understand
You were the one I couldn't let slip through my hands

I remember when the lights came on
A blinding sun came shining on my world
Baby you're everything and more than everything I wanted
More than I deserve
Unthinkable, undreamable,unbelievable
Better than beautiful

The only thing that compares to what we have
Is little mini me mini you running 'round calling me dad
I look at her and see her mama's eyes
And I've got another reason to thank God I'm alive

I remember when the lights came on
A blinding sun came shinning on my world
Baby you're everything and more than everything I wanted
More than I deserve
Unthinkable, undreamable, unbelievable
Better than beautiful

I'm blessed with everything ill ever need
I've got the sweetest life a man could hope to lead

I remember when the lights came on
A blinding sun came shining on my world
You gave me everything and more than everything I wanted
More than I deserve
Unthinkable, undreamable, unbelievable
So magical, so natural so wonderful
Better than beautiful

Better than beautiful
