In all the pictures that I've seen
Of how angels are supposed to be
There's an aura, a kind of emanating light
Suggesting perfection that may very well be true
But they can't hold a halo to you

Their role as protector is what God made them for
And I take comfort in knowing they're around
I don't mean to sound ungrateful or diminish what they do
But they can't hold a halo to you

By their by nature they must be heaven sent
Here to work their miracles, to wonder and to bless

I pray the Lord forgives me 'cause when you touched me that's when i knew
That they can't hold a halo to you
No they can't hold a halo to you
