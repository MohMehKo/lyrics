I used to think I'd go out with a bang,
On the back of a Harley, racin' a train,
Runnin' with bulls over in Spain with the crazies.
I've never been one to back down from a dare
Jumpin' through fire or fallin' through air
It didn't matter, cause I didn't care until lately.

Now I'll tell you how I wanna go,
Under a sail with my feet on the rail of a boat,
Takin' it nice and slow,
Ridin' the tide with you right by my side sittin' close.
With a Cuban cigar and my old guitar
Listening to you sing along to a song I just wrote
Missin' some notes.
That's how I wanna go.

When daddy died, he was just forty-eight
I can just see him and those pearly gates
Sayin', "I kinda figured, I'da been late to this party."
And nobody knows how their life's gonna end,
They don't know where it will happen or when
All I can say, is when I met you, mine started.

Now I'll tell you how I wanna go,
Under a sail with my feet on the rail of a boat,
Takin' it nice and slow,
Ridin' the tide with you right by my side sittin' close.
With a Cuban cigar, a beat up guitar
Listening to you sing along with a song I just wrote
Missin' the notes.
That's how I wanna go.

Takin' it nice and slow,
Ridin' the tide with you right by my side sittin' close.
With a Cuban cigar, a beat up guitar
Listening to you harmonize on a song I just wrote
Every note.
That's how I wanna go.
