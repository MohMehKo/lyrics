I'll be glad to sign my autograph
If you want me to
God knows I love singing
It's what i was born to do
You see me up there center stage
In the spotlight for awhile
But in the things that really matter
I'm just sitting on the isle

'Cause i've seen a third grade angel with
Dark circles 'neath her eyes
Not a trace of hair left on her head
Sayin' daddy don't you cry
A single mom workin' overtime
A college kid reading to the blind
Whe you look for heros know that i'm just a singer in a band

I'm thankful to be living in
This childhood dream come true
But sometimes the attention just leaves me confused
Hey, I love my t-shirt on those kids, my name there up in lights
But when the show is done and i'm on the bus riding through the night

I think of third grade angel with
Dark circles 'neath her eyes
Not a trace of hair left on her head
Sayin' daddy don't you cry
A soldier in a field of mines
With each step he lays it on the line
When you look for heros know that i'm just a singer in a band

I'm humbled when you take the time
To hear my life in verse and rhyme
But when it comes to heros i know i'm just a singer in a band
A singer in a band

I'll be glad to sign my autograph if you want me to
