You've got me walking up on air and I'm afraid of heights
You fill my days with thoughts of you, then rob my sleep at night
I see another side of me when you come into view
I hate the way I love you, but I do

I hate the way I miss you every time you're not around
And the way you've got me thinking it's time to settle down
I've tried to fight the feeling but this time there's no use
I hate the way I love you, but I do

I always used to pride myself, I've never lost control
When I felt I was in too deep, I'd pack my heart and go
Now I fall all in pieces at the thought of losing you
I hate the way I love you, but I do

I hate the way I miss you every time you're not around
And the way you've got me thinking it's time to settle down
I've tried to fight the feeling but this time there's no use
I hate the way I love you, but I do
I've tried to fight the feeling but this time there's no use
I hate the way I love you, but I do
Oh, I hate the way I love you, but I do
