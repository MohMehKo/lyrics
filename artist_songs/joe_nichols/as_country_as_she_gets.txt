She hates goin' anywhere in my old truck
She says it's always muddy and it rides so rough
Abd there ain't no graceful way to climb up in a dress
Yeah i'm about as country as she gets

I might get her on the lake to fish with me
If the water's smooth and the sky is blue and a nice cool breeze
But anything we catch i'll have to clean myself
Cause i'm about as country as she gets

She'll slip off a pair of heels
Walk barefoot across the field
Climb up on the fence just to be near me
Sometimes i think that horse still scares her half to death
Yeah i'm about as country as she gets

She likes being within spending distance of a mall
Havin' enough bars to make a cell phone call
Put her in a crowd and she's right in her element
Yeah i'm about as country as she gets

She'll slip out on the porch sometimes
When that sun's low in the sky
Pull up a rocking chair just to be with me
Until that first big junebug buzzes by her head
You see i'm about as country as she gets
Yeah i'm about as country as she gets

She hates goin' anywhere in my old truck
