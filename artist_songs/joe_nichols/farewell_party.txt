[cover of Gene Watson song]

When the last breath of life
Is gone from my body
And my lips are as cold as the sea
When my friends gather round
For my farewell party
Won't you pretend you love me

there'll be flowers from those who'll cry
When I go and leave you in this old world alone
I know you'll have fun at my farewell party
Won't you be glad when i'm gone

Don't be mad at me
For wanting to keep you
Till my life on this old world is through
you'll be free at the end of my farewell party
But I'll, I'll go away loving you

There'll be flowers from those who'll cry
When I go and leave you in this old world alone
I know you'll have fun at my farewell party
Won't you be glad when I'm gone
Oh won't you be glad when I'm goooo oooo ooone
