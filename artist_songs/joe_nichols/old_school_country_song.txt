Somewhere in the world tonight
Someone’s on a red-eye flight
While someone’s heart is breaking back at home
Somewhere out there in a bar
Someone swipes a credit card
Buys a beer to cry in all night long

In a chat room out in cyberspace
They might not be face to face
They both know they’re up to something wrong
They say we’ve come a long long way
Talkin’ ‘bout the world today
It still sounds like an old school country song

Cause folks still love and folks still leave
Drunks get drunk and cheaters cheat
And there’s just something lonesome about a midnight train
Someone done somebody wrong
We’ll miss mama when she’s gone
And trust me that ain’t never gonna change
Breakin’ up is still a mess
It don’t make a heart hurt less
Cause you text it from a mobile phone
All you’ve really done you see
Is modernize the melody
But it still sounds like an old school country song

Folks still love and folks still leave
Drunks get drunk and cheaters cheat
And there’s just something lonesome about a midnight train
Someone done somebody wrong
We’ll miss mama when she’s gone
And trust me that ain’t never gonna change
You can take it off that old jukebox
Burn it on your new iPod
But three chords and the truth are just as strong
You can say we’ve come a long long way
Play what you wanna play
But there’s nothing like an old school country song
Yeah life is still an old school country song
