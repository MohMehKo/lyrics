Might be the way your hair falls on your shoulder
Or the sparkle in your baby blues
All I know is you hypnotize me
And I can't take my eyes off you.

You say it's a postcard sunset
But any painter would envy the view
Girl I have to take your word for it
Cause I can't take my eyes off you

You could tell me there's two full moons
Hangin' up there in the sky.
That a thousand stars are fallin'
And a comet just flew by.
Wish I could turn my head and see that too
But I can't take my eyes off you,
Girl I can't take my eyes off you.

You could tell me there's two full moons
Hangin' up there in the sky.
That a thousand stars are fallin'
And a comet just flew by.
Wish I could turn my head and see that too
But I can't take my eyes off you,
Oh, I can't take my eyes off you.

Might be the way your hair falls on your shoulder
Or the sparkle in your baby blues
All I know is you hypnotize me
And I can't take my eyes off you,
No I can't take my eyes off you,
Girl I can't take my eyes off you.
