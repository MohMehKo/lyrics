Couple beers
Couple crickets
Little secret little spot
Y'ant to

Big old blanket
Big old moon
Big old creek side view
Y'ant to

Little bit of hugging
Little bit of loving
Little bit of something we can't talk about
Girl, you know what I'm talking about
The kind of thing that's only me and you

Geting cozy
Watching ripples
Catching lightning in a jar
There's a little snug a waiting
Girl, time's a wasting
And I'm ready when you are
Girl, y'ant to

Little bit of hugging
Little bit of loving
Little bit of something we can't talk about
Girl, you know what I'm talking about
The kind of thing that's only me and you
Y'ant to

Come on and try it
You just might like it
And if you do we can do it all again
If y'ant to

Little bit of hugging
Little bit of loving
Little bit of something we can't talk about
Girl, you know what I'm talking about
The kind of thing that's only me and you
There ain't nothing else I wanna do
Y'ant to
