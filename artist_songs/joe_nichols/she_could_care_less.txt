I'm the luckiest man in this whole world
'Cause I got the love of a sweet girl
Yeah, I'm as amazed as I can be
I swear I don't see what she sees in me

She could care less, but she don't
She could say goodbye but she won't
Why she loves me, I'll never know
She could care less, but she don't

Well all I own is a rockbottom van
She only had diamonds on both of her hands
But now I don't know why she hasn't lived
Couldn't blame her if she traded me for someone else
