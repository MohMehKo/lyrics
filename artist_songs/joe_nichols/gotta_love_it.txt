Don't it seem' like the sun is a little bit brighter, 
sit a little higher, in the sky today.
Don't it taste like the air that you're breathin' is sweeter, 
makes you wanna breath deeper, hey hey hey

You gotta love it when that someone you lovin' is, lovin' you right back.
Your one and only is the only other one in this world, makes you feel like that.
Everything she does is does it.
Hmm gotta love, gotta love, gotta love, gotta love it.

You look up and the leaves in the trees are dancin', 
just how it happened, you can't say.
Those feelings that you thought were all behind you, 
sneak up and find you, remind you, it's never to late.

You gotta love it when that someone you lovin' is, lovin' you right back.
Your one and only is the only other one in this world, makes you feel like that.
Everything she does is does it.
Hmm gotta love, gotta love, gotta love, gotta love it.

Nice and easy, like a front porch swinging, 
sunday morning feelin'... Hmmm gotta love it.

You gotta love it when that someone you lovin' is, lovin' you right back.
Your one and only is the only other one in this world, makes you feel like that.
Everything she does is does it.
Hmm gotta love, gotta love, gotta love, gotta love it.

You gotta love it.
Hmmhmmhmm.
You gotta love it
Hmm
Gotta love, gotta love, gotta love, gotta love it.
