Toes in the water with the river rollin'
That little bit of butterfly tattoo showin'
Nothin' to do
Just let me fall in love with you

Aw, long hair fallin' on a sun tanned shoulder
I'm wantin' you bads about to take me over
And I'm set on cruise
Just let me fall in love with you

Already got those crickets singin'
Man you better go on and kiss her, moonlight spotlight
Ain't a chance in the world I'll miss it
Don't blink, don't think, don't move
Just let me fall in love with you
Just let me fall in love with you

Your skin wont stop feeling my fingers
I wanna wade in where the waters deeper
Nothin' to lose
Just let me fall in love with you

Already got those crickets singin'
Man you better go on and kiss her, moonlight spotlight
Ain't a chance in the world I'll miss it
Don't blink, don't think, don't move
Just let me fall in love with you

You don't get in the way of somethin'
You can't slow down and you can't out run it
All I know is I feel it comin'

Already got those crickets singin'
Man you better go on and kiss her, moonlight spotlight
Ain't a chance in the world I'll miss it
Don't blink, don't think, don't move
Just let me fall in love with the

Already got those crickets singin'
