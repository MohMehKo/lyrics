And the looks decent wagon didn't pass me by
There ain't nothing in my past that i'm tryin' hard to hide
And i don't understand why i gotta wonder why

Had an old man tell me, "Boy if you were smart
You'd hit the produce isle at the Super Walmart"
So i bumped into a pretty girl's shopping cart
But all i did was break her eggs and bruise her artichoke hearts
