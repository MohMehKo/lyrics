Love has a way of unbuttoning buttons
Turning lights down low til they're next to nothing
Rolling those perfect words right off my tongue
Love has a way of just picking up flowers
Making me forget we've been talking for hours
Turning the midnight moon into a morning sun
Showing me you're the one

Baby, you've got me listening to love songs
Dancing with you on the bank of this creek
Slipping and tripping on my two left feet
And I wonder how'm I gonna hold on
How's a guy like me get a girl like you to stay
Love has a way

Love has a way of drinking up moonshine
Laying us down on a blanket under these pines
Pressing your Burt's Bee lips upon mine
Losing all track of time

Baby, you've got me listening to love songs
Dancing with you on the bank of this creek
Slipping and tripping on my two left feet
And I wonder how'm I gonna hold on
How's a guy like me get a girl like you to stay
Love has a way

I'm lying here with you
Instead of wild-running
Must've had a little help
Cause I never could've done it 

Baby, you've got me listening to love songs
Dancing with you on the bank of this creek
Slipping and tripping on my two left feet
And I wonder how'm I gonna hold on
How's a guy like me get a girl like you to stay
Love has a way
