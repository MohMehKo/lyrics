We can talk
I could buy you some drinks
We could spend the whole night
Not saying what we think
We could get on outta here
Cut through the BS
Not waste another minute
Get on down in it
And see how far we get

Show me your Bush Hog
I'll show you my John Deere
Show me your corn field
I'll show you my low gear
Show me your hot damn, yes ma'am
Your beer, and here I am
Show me your yee haw
I'll show you my hee haw

Well that kiss
Was Honeysuckle sweet
Girl you got me flying high
And buzzing like a bee
We're out here in the country
Where you reap what you sow
Let's break a little ground
Go another round
Before that rooster crows

Show me your Bush Hog
I'll show you my John Deere
Show me your corn field
I'll show you my low gear
Show me your hot damn, yes ma'am
Your beer, and here I am
Show me your yee haw
I'll show you my hee haw

Well don't be shy, just be yourself
We'll play a little game of show and tell

Show me your ah-ha
I'll show you my oh yeah
Show me your too hot to handle
Baby, I'll show ya
I know how to break a sweat
Show me your hot damn, yes ma'am
Your beer, and here I am
Show me your yee haw
I'll show you my hee haw
I'll show you my hee haw
