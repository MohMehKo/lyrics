In the little town where I'm from
We've got a two-way street where everybody runs
Big silver moon shines through the pines
Just about says it for our sky line
No one's complaining about nothing changing here

Local paper has a page or two
Just about covers the hometown news
One kind of button on the radio dial
Crankin' out country for a country mile
No one's complaining about nothing changing here

All summer long the nights are hot
Hanging out here in the parking lot
Sittin gon the hood of your pickup truck
Talking to your girl about falling in love
Yeah everybody here is a member of
The Wal-Mart Parking Lot Social Club

Ain't nothing broke nothing to fix
Things are just rocking here in the sticks
A little laid back we ain't going fast 
Kinda like living life here in the past but
No one's complaining about nothing changing here
