I knew I’d be blue, I knew I’d be sad,
I was sure your goodbye was gonna hurt me bad.
Counted on days of lonely old nights
Hoped that I’d forgive and forget with a little time

But man, woman you sure messed me up
Now long as I live, I’ll never forget your love
Man, woman you sure make me cry
Take 99 years for all of my tears to dry.
Man, woman

I tried to go out, put on a smile
I managed to get you out of my mind, baby, once in a while.
But more often than not, old memories break through
Now I can’t walk half way round the block without runnin into you

Man, woman you sure messed me up
Now long as I live, I’ll never forget your love
Man, woman you sure make me cry
Take 99 years for all of my tears to dry.
Man, woman

Well I used to think I was strong, I was tough and nothin could tear me apart
But whatever it is that you done to me darlin sure did a number on my heart

Man, woman, you sure make me cry
Take 99 years for all of my tears to dry.
Man, woman

Man, woman
