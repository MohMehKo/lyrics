Yeah, I saw you watching me tonight from across the room
I appreciate the drink: that was nice of you
Thanks for coming out to see me, I hope you liked the show
Yeah, that's right, I settled down about six months ago
No, she ain't here tonight, she stayed at home
Yeah, it sure does get lonely out here on the road

By looking in your eyes, I can tell what's on your mind
Yeah, I'd love to drive you home and hold your body close to mine
You're everything a man could dream of, baby
You're all woman, but she's all lady

I met her at a Baptist church in Tennessee
She was looking for someone
I was praying it was me
No, she never thought she'd fall in love with a guitar man
Ah, it took some getting used to, but she does the best she can
No, she don't like to stay at home alone
No, I don't need your number
She's probably waiting by the phone

By looking in your eyes, I can tell what's on your mind
Yeah, I'd love to drive you home and hold your body close to mine
You're everything a man could dream of, baby
You're all woman, ah, but she's all lady

[Instrumental Interlude]

No, it ain't you; Lord knows, you're a sight
Yeah, I probably could but I could never make believe it's right
I'd rather be alone, and I know that sounds crazy
Cause you're all woman, but she's all lady
You're all woman, but she's my lady
