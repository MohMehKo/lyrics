Today I did something
I never thought I’d do
The choice, wasn’t easy
But I had to
All the years together
All those cold lonely nights
I never thought I’d be strong enough
To leave it all behind
Yeah, today I said goodbye
To an old friend of mine.

Well it won’t be easy
But it’s never easy
When you let down
The one you love
There’s someone at home
Who needs me
So I’m givin’ up
She always knew the truth
Never left my side
Man a love like that
Only comes once in a life
So today I said goodbye
To an old friend of mine

My hands were shakin’
And my knees were weak
As I poured my last shot
And I drank my last drink.
And I heard Freedom ring
When that bottle hit the floor
And I just walked away
Not needing any more

Yeah, today I said goodbye
To an old friend of mine.

Yeah, today I said goodbye
To an old friend of mine.
