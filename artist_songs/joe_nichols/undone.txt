Sunset is starting to cast some shadows on the wall
And if you're thinkin' about me you don't even have to call
If you wanna come on over baby I wanna let you
Been caught up in the moment from the moment I met you
Yeah I've been watching the hands on the clock
And I've been leaving the latch on the lock

Undone, like the buttons on your shirt
Undone, showing every single curve
I want, you so bad baby
You know how to make me come
Undone, kissing all up on my neck
Undone, catching every single breath
I love, how easily you do something to me
That just can't be undone

Girl you know you're gonna start a fire when you touch me like that
So go ahead and pull me over the edge I won't ever go back
Baby when you hold me I can't hold it together
I got a little taste and now I want it forever
Just watching your hair fall
Oh girl you know how to get me all

Undone, like the buttons on your shirt
Undone, showing every single curve
I want, you so bad baby
You know how to make me come
Undone, kissing all up on my neck
Undone, catching every single breath
I love, how easily you do something to me
That just can't be undone

I just wanna end up all tangled up
I just wanna get all wrapped in your love

Undone, like the buttons on your shirt
Undone, showing every single curve
I want, you so bad baby
You know how to make me come
Undone, kissing all up on my neck
Undone, catching every single breath
I love, how easily you do something to me
That just can't be undone

I just wanna end up all tangled up
I just wanna get all wrapped in your love
