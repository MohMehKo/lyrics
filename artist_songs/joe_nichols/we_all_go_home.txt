Eatin' strawberry pie in a mid-town diner
Next thing you know you're back in South Carolina
Stuffin' your mouth at Grandma's house

Then a lady in a booth gets onto her kids
Lays down the law like your mama did
And it makes you smile 'cause every once in a while

We all go home to a place and a time
In our hearts and our minds
That we just can't outgrow

There's a tie that'll bind you
And love that'll find you
No matter where you go
Someday, someway we all go home

You tell yourself the grass is greener
That Podunk town ain't the place for a dreamer
Throw a dart at a map and you don't look back

Try to change your clothes and the way you talk
One day you slip on that Southern drawl
And you have to laugh, yeah, just like that

We all go home to a place and a time
In our hearts and our minds
That we just can't outgrow

There's a tie that'll bind you
And love that'll find you
No matter where you go
Someday, someway we all go home

The choir sings and the preacher talks
Six of your old friends take you for a walk
Up that shady hill, yeah, someday they will

We all go, we all go home

There's a tie that'll bind you
And love that'll find you
No matter where you go
Someday, someway we all go home

We all go home
We all go home
We all go home
We all go home
