She's not that good a driver
And it's not that good a car
There's rain on that horizon
She's never gone that far

No storm is gonna stop her
Not a little thing like that
I gotta sit here all night knowin'
That she ain't comin' back

She's gonna make it
She'll be alright
Out on her own, I have no doubt
It's me that I'm worried about

She's never been to Dallas
That's a big ol' town
It ain't exactly easy
To find your way around

She's never met a stranger
She makes friends right and left
This house is so empty
I'm here all by myself

She's gonna make it
She'll be alright
Out on her own, I have no doubt
It's me that I'm worried about

She don't look back where she's been
She just lives in the moment, yeah

That she's gonna make it
She'll be alright
Out on her own, I have no doubt
It's me that I'm worried about
