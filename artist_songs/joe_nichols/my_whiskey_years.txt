One of these days I'm gonna wake up
With somethin' to lose, and I'll get over you
I walk outside, I look at the sky
And for the first time, the clear blue eyes

My head won't hurt, my heart won't ache
I won't forgive myself for my mistakes
And I'll be good as new
If I can just get through my whiskey years

One of these nights when I'm feelin' brave
You'll come back around and I'm gonna put you down
I might start to shake, well, I'll find the strength
To stand up straight and I'll walk away

And I won't look back, you won't see
If I fall apart when you follow me
I'll be good as new
If I can just get through my whiskey years

My whiskey years, my wilder days
The crazy times when I was stoned out of my mind
When I could sit and sip away all the hurt and pain
Whom I tryna fool? I'm still goin' through
My whiskey years

My whiskey years, my wilder days
The crazy times, when I was stoned out of my mind
When I could sit and sip away all the hurt and pain
Whom I tryna fool? I'm still goin' through
My whiskey years, my whiskey years
