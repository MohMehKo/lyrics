Pass the cotton fields and the old spring mill
We laid a blanket down where the world was still
Where nothing but a quarter of moon lights up the dark
Just me and her letting nature work
When it feels so right there's no need for words
All cuddled up just listening to our hearts

And the crickets, itty bitty crickets
Ain't another sound for miles around, just listen
It's quiet, real quiet
When the crickets start chirping, lord, don't they say it all

It was going great, just our third date
We were taking it slow, but getting carried away
I never thought you could fall so far so soon
It could have been the rice or the Boones Farm wine
But either way my tongue came untied
We both heard me say "I love you"

Crickets, nothing but crickets
Ain't another sound for miles around, just listen
It's quiet, real quiet
When the crickets start chirping, lord, don't they say it all

It might have been seconds but it felt like an hour
Then she gave me a kiss, said it's all worked out
Got my mama's white dress, my grandmama's ring
I know a little church baby what do you think
She said what do you think

It's quiet, ha ha, real quiet
When the crickets start chirping, lord, don't they say it all
Oh crickets, itty bitty crickets
When the crickets start chirping, lord, don't they say it all
