I don't want a fast car
 don't need a four lane highway
There's not another place I'd rather be
'Cause out here in the country
Bluebirds sing for nothing
And the shade comes free with a tree
Yeah he shade comes free with a tree

The tree came with a mountain
Right beside the river where the ground makes one heck of a scene
The mountain counts for something, the view is worth a fortune
And the shade comes free with a tree
I never had a dollar that could buy me what i'm feelin'
But i'm feelin' 'bout as good as I can be
I need to be reminded when i'm lookin' for a bargain
Not to overlook what's right in front of me

I'll never make a killing trying to make a living
But I make enough to raise a family
I bought a piece of heaven off county road 11
Where the shade comes free with a tree
Yeah where the shade comes free with a tree

I never had a dollar that could buy me what i'm feeling
And i'm feeling 'bout as good as i can be
I need to be reminded when i'm lookin' for a bargain
Not to overlook what's right in front of me

I don't want a fast car
don't need a four lane highway
There's not another place i'd rather be
Down county road 11
There's this little piece of heaven
Where the shade comes free with a tree
Yeah where the shade comes free with a tree

Yeah the shad comes free with a tree
