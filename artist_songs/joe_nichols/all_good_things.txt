I never have someone so close
And it felt any better
I had a kiss laid on my lips
I could taste forever
Why is it, all good things must come to?

I never had laid down besides
Someone so warm and tender
Laid eyes on eyes so big and blue
You'd always remember
Why is it all good things must come to?

An end you didn't want it to, God knows why it did
You asked yourself a million times as long as you live
Why is it all good things must come to an end?

I never seen a smile that held my heart so captivated
A touch that made me want it more, longer than it waited
Why is it all good things must come to?

I never thought I'd see the day
The time just stood there still
Watched my life just drive away
My world behind the wheel
Why is it all good things must come to?

An end you didn't want it to, God knows why it did
You asked yourself a million times as long as you live
Why is it all good things must come to an end?
