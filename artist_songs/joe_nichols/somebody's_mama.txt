That new tattoo still stung just a little
The old guy said "Well, what do you think?
Is this what you wanted?
Just the word 'freedom'
Surrounded by eagles' wings"
He said "It's none of my business,
But who is this angel,
That you had me cover up?"
I said "Oh, that's just a name,
It still makes me think of a girl I used to love"

But I figured she's probably somebody's mama by now
I bet she's covered in diamonds, that car that she's driving
Cost more than most people's house.
She used to say how she wanted babies and I was too young to slow down
But I figured she's probably somebody's mama by now.

We used to sit on the hood of my old blue Camaro and watch the sun come up
Stare out across that big sleepy desert, like the whole world revolved us
And I hope she'd smile if she knew right now, that I was talking like this
But she's out there somewhere, makin' somebody happy, wherever she is

But I figured she's probably somebody's mama by now
I bet she's covered in diamonds, that car that she's driving
Cost more than most people's house.
She used to say how she wanted babies and I was too young to slow down
But I figured she's probably somebody's mama by now.

I don't know where she is,
I'm glad I don't know where she lives,
Cause one day I just might show up at her door.

But I figured she's probably somebody's mama by now
I bet she's covered in diamonds, that car that she's driving
Cost more than most people's house.
She used to say how she wanted babies and I was too young to slow down
But I figured she's probably somebody's mama by now.
Oh, I figured she's probably somebody's mama by now.
