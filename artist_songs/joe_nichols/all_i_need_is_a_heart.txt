I got it all figured out
I know just what it's gonna take
And ain't nothin' that can't be put back
Together when it breaks

All I need is a plan, a place to begin
And a way to understand
How to put back the pieces again

Don't need another sunny day
What good would that do?
Don't need another rainstorm
Try to wash away these blues

Don't need an old friend
Or somebody new
All I need is a heart
I don't need you

'Cause I have a dream
I know just how it's gonna be
I'm gonna feel same as I did
Oh, you ever laid eyes on me

I'll be free as the wind
Like a bird on the wing
I know I'm only missing
This one little thing

Don't need another sunny day
What good would that do?
Don't need another rainstorm
And try to wash away these blues

Don't need an old friend
Or somebody new
All I need is a heart
I don't need you

All I need is a heart
I don't need you
