Well I hit the snooze when the alarm clock rings
Layin' there doin' that sleepy head thing
There's a bird out my window spreadin' his wings
Cheap chirp doin' that singin'
Thing I do when I first get up is the coffee thing in my favorite cup
Two gets me goin' got things to do
Let me tell you a thing or two

Everything's a thing 
If you know what I mean
You can't do nothin' 'cause there's no such thing
Some things are big, some things are small
Some mean a lot, some nothin' at all
It's all laid out in the scheme of things
No matter what it is
Everything's a thing

Off to work in my old Mustang
Doin' that bumper to bumper thing
Up ahead a ring a ling ding ding
Some guy's doin' that cell phone
Thing is the light's turned green and he ain't doin' that drivin' thing
And the thing about all this that talkin' thing and drivin' don't mix

Everything's a thing
If you know what I mean
You can't do nothin' 'cause there's no such thing
Some things are big, some things are small
Some mean a lot, some nothin' at all
It's all laid out in the scheme of things
No matter what it is
Everything's a thing

If you think this song
Ain't worth hummin'
You've got another thing comin'.

Everything's a thing
If you know what I mean 
You can't do nothin' 'cause there's no such thing
Some things are big, some things are small
Some mean a lot, some nothin' at all
It's all laid out in the scheme of things
No matter what it is
Everything's a thing
Everything's a thing
You gotta do your thing
Everything's a thing
