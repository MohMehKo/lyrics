She caught me at home without the lights on
Ten minutes more and I'd of been gone
Out somewhere painting the town
Since your here face to face
You've got a few things you want to set straight
On all of the rumors you say I've been spreading around
Yeah I said I'm glad it's over to tell you the truth
If you havne't found somebody new I hope you do
I said I didn't miss you at all
I never wanted for you to call
And I never cried but
To tell you the truth, I lied

Well I can't deny but baby I tried
To put you down just to cover my pride
After all I've said I guess we're done
If I had to do it all over again
Before I'd break I'd be willing to bend
One second chance girl, you'd be second to none
