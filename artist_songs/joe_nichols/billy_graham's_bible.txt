Like a book on a shelf
Taking up space
Like a six string in a closet
Locked up in it's case
I was lost and alone
Just another man
'Til you finally picked me up and made me who I am

I'm like Billy Graham's bible
And that old guitar Willie plays
The good lord had a plan for them
The moment they were made
In the right hands, they come alive
You understand, the reason why
Some things wind up where they're meant to be
Like Billy Graham's bible
Willie's old guitar, and me

My whole life changed
When I found you
I never dreamed I'd ever be the me
That I've turned into
I'd be out there driftin'
On my own
Always lying in your lovin' arms
I know I'm finally home

Like Billy Graham's bible
And that old guitar Willie plays
The good lord had a plan for them
The moment they were made
In the right hands, they come alive
You understand, the reason why
Some things wind up where they're meant to be
Like Billy Graham's bible
Willie's old guitar, and me

Well souls got saved and blue eyes cried
Here I am with you tonight
Thank god some things wind up where they're meant to be
Like Billy Graham's bible
Willie's old guitar, and me
