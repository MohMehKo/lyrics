I do my best to play by the rules
I've bend a couple even break a few
Don't get me wrong, I wanna do right
I just can't seem to live in a virtuous light

Headaches by the bottle, heartaches by the number
Six of one, half dozen of the other

I fell in love with a preachers daughter
They washed my soul in the holy water
I gave her my heart and bought her a house
The devil broke in and broke me out

Now I owe the bank some money and I lost another lover
Six of one, half dozen of the other

No matter how you add it up it's always the same
I give it my best and all I gets the blame
I'm living and loving and barely breaking even
Can't be me must be the company I'm keeping

I went on out and made some brand new friends
Started my life all over again
Now some of them are saints and some of them are sinners
I'mstill searching for a way to be a winner

I roll box cars one way or another
Six of one, half dozen of the other
