Ever since I met you we've been kinda getting used to the way
You hold me tight
I quit running round and all the silly games that I played
Every night
It never was my plan to be a one woman man

But I'm not that kind of guy
That ain't never been my cup of tea
I'm not that kind of guy
Something about you keeps telling me that I'm gonna be

I bent over backwards all my life
To keep a ring off my hand
And just be one of the boys
All I ever wanted to be was a rodeo man
And just make some noise
It never was my plan to be a one woman man
