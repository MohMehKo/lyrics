Good morning to you mr. hundred and one
Last night was fun but I gotta get going
See I'm not the girl to stay in one place
Or sleep with one man in a world that's still moving
I'm a big girl in a small world
And love is a game but I've already played
And I won't make the same mistake

Slip one time and your walls will fall
You wonder how you lost it all
You shut my heart and you stole my soul
That's the reason why...
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go (you gotta go)
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go
You gotta go

Promiscuous they would classify me
But they wouldn't be if I were one of the boys
I get out of bed, wipe that look off your face
I had my taste but you're off of the menu
I'm a big girl in a small world
And love is a game but I've already played
And I won't make the same mistake

Slip one time and your walls will fall
You wonder how you lost it all
He shut my heart and he stole my soul
That's the reason why...
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go (you gotta go)
You gotta go, you gotta go

Just pack up and leave, get out while you can
How can I trust you when you sound just like them
If you're looking for love you won't find it in me
The heart that once loved it doesn't bleed
Anymore, anymore, anymore
Cause love is a game and I already played
And I won't make the same mistake

Cause I slip one time and my walls had fall
I wonder how you lost it all
He shut my heart and he stole my soul
That's the reason why...
I slip one time and my walls had fall
I wonder how you lost it all
He shut my heart and he stole my soul
You gotta go...
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go
Just pack up and go
