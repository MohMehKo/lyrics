I'm a be here when the storm and the rain comes
I'm a stay here with you
And I'm a write a poem and a song with your name in it
I'm a write a song for you

About a fairytale life with a prince and a princess
Darling, it's a dream come true
Like we found a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
Made a nice life for two

We are the lucky ones, we are the ever young
We are the lucky ones (we are the lucky ones)
We are the lucky ones, we are free to love
We are the lucky ones (we are the lucky ones)

Oh oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
We are the lucky ones
Oh oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
We are the lucky ones

We're gonna live like a rodeo family
You're a king without a crown
And even without all the gold and the ranches
Baby, I can say it loud oh oh

We are the lucky ones, we are the ever young
We are the lucky ones (we are the lucky ones)
We are the lucky ones, we are free to love
We are the lucky ones (we are the lucky ones)

Oh oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
We are the lucky ones
Oh oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
We are the lucky ones

I'll take the trouble with the risk
I'll even seal it with a kiss
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for us
I wanna help you play the banjo
Bring the arms up in the gander
To you pledge pledge allegiance

We are the lucky ones, we are the ever young
We are the lucky ones (we are the lucky ones)
We are the lucky ones, we are free to love
We are the lucky ones (we are the lucky ones)

Oh oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
We are the lucky ones
Oh oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
We are the lucky ones
