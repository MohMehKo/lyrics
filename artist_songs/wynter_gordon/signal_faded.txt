Can you hear me now?

[Verse 1:]
Lost in translation, can't understand what you're phrasing
You think you're tellin me obvious things, but baby
There must be somethin I'm missin in what you're sayin
Cause I'm not gettin the messages you're relayin

[Bridge:]
I can't hear you now with this bad connection
Let me hit you back, must be bad reception
Boy, we're breaking up, leave a message
Oh, can you hear me now? Can you hear me?

[Chorus:]
You don't have to call me tonight cause
I am off your redial tonight
You lost me like a dropped call, that's right boy
The signal faded, signal faded

[Verse 2:]
You faded our conversation from all the static
You couldn't keep the connection when you had it
Seems like we're victims, the system we had is crashing
Why you keep tryin? It's dyin, no comin back again

[Bridge:]
I can't hear you now with this bad connection
Let me hit you back, must be bad reception
Boy, we're breaking up, leave a message
Oh, can you hear me now? Can you hear me?

[Chorus:]
You don't have to call me tonight cause
I am off your redial tonight
You lost me like a dropped call, that's right boy
The signal faded, signal faded

[Verse 3:]
Off in space, I know there must be somethin out there
Cause you're outside of my cosmic circle
Lost out here in the abyss, it's like a lunar eclipse
We're losing signal
Off in space, you're on the opposite side of me
The space between us is never ending
Lost out here in the abyss, it's like a lunar eclipse
We're losing signal

[Chorus: x2]
You don't have to call me tonight cause
I am off your redial tonight
You lost me like a dropped call, that's right boy
The signal faded, signal faded
