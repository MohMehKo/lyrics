You've got your secrets and I've got mine
All of the things that we tried to hide
(But I'm tellin' you)
We used to be on the same damn side
Now we can't find the truth behind the lies

How did we ever let the love we had start to look so bad?
And the memories are killin' me, oh, don't you think it's sad?
And we try to say goodbye but I just can't try no more
But I can't see the good in you walking out that door

Tell myself that things are goin' to get better
Tell myself that no more stormy weather
I can see that most of what we has gone dry
But no matter how hard I try can't see the good in goodbye

I'm feelin' lost, don't know what to say
'Cause one minute we got love then it's gone and we're wrong
But what's killing me is we used to be on the same damn page
Somehow that chapter slipped away

How did we ever let the love we had start to look so bad?
And the memories are killin' me, oh, don't you think it's sad?
And we try to say goodbye but I just can't try no more
But I can't see the good in you walking out that door

Tell myself that things are goin' to get better
Tell myself that no more stormy weather
I can see that most of what we has gone dry
But no matter how hard I try can't see the good in goodbye

(Where did we, where did we go wrong?)
I don't know
(Where did we, where did we go wrong?)
Can we fix it?

(Where did we, where did we go wrong?)
I don't want you to go 'cause I know we belong
(Where did we, where did we go wrong?)
I don't know

(Where did we, where did we go wrong?)
So busy
(Running back, don't you hear this song?)
Tell me will you be gone

Tell myself that things are goin' to get better
Tell myself that no more stormy weather
I can see that most of what we has gone dry
But no matter how hard I try can't see the good in goodbye
Can't see the good in goodbye
Can't see the good in goodbye
Can't see the good in goodbye
