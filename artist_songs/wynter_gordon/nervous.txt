Come on tell me what’s the words
Eyelid, lips I’ve never heard
Show me that you really like me
Come now

I’ll give you a little time
Five minutes to blow my mind
That’s all I need to
Figure you out
Figure you out
Figure you out
Figure you out
Oh, oh

You know I’m the bomb
I’m like candy on your arm
When I play I play for keeps, so what’s in it for me?

Oh submission doesn’t hurt
If you whistle while you work
Tell me that you wanna please me
Right now
If you look me in the eye
Tell it all and don’t be shy
That’s all I need to
Figure you out
Figure you out
Figure you out
Figure you out

Do I make you nervous?
Do I make you nervous?
Do I make you nervous?
Nervous

You know I’m the bomb
I’m like candy on your arm
When I play I play for keeps, so what’s in it for me?

[Travis Scott:]
Girl you make me so nervous
The type that might commit murder
I used to sneak inside your house bring you sherbet
We used to fantasize a lot about
All of the nights in your white mansion
She wore even a bandanna
Leave it till the sunshine
Took you home she ran like every light
For like three summers then
I was like every night
we used to party when we fuss and fight
Get enchilada at eight to make it right
But that was never right
It was never right but now I’m gonna get it right

Figure you out
Figure you out
Figure you out

Do I make you nervous?
Do I make you nervous?
Do I make you nervous?
Nervous
Nervous

You know I’m the bomb
I’m like candy on your arm
When I play I play for keeps, so what’s in it for me?

So if you call me
I just might be waiting on the phone
But don’t ignore me
Girls like me won’t be alone for long
Call me
Waiting by the phone
Won’t be
Be alone for long
