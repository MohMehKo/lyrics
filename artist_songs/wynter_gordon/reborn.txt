I've been touched by an angel
I've been touched [x2]

[Verse 1:]
I've been to hell and back
Gone on an odyssey
Danced with the devil some
Then made some enemies

I've broke some hearts before
Split up relationships
Made poor excuses for
Said my heart didn't exist

[Bridge:]
And all the things I wanted I thought I had
I wasn't looking back
Everybody warned me, yeah, that I was gonna crash
Until I really did
I was broken, so open
I could have used a friend
Lied to myself and I could'ntkeep on pretending

[Chorus:]
Reborn
Making me over again
Oh, reborn
Is this the start of the end?
Reborn
Paying the debt for my sins
I will take it to the grave
Cause then my soul I will save
Reborn

I've been touched by an angel
I've been touched

[Verse 2:]
In this confessional
Take apart all of me
Rid me of evil
Wipe my hands clean

Dust off the blood and dirt
Cast off the shame and hurt
I need those scars to fade away
It's the clearing of my name

[Bridge:]
And all the things I wanted I thought I had
I wasn't looking back
Everybody warned me, yeah, that I was gonna crash
Until I really did
I was broken, so open
I could have used a friend
Lied to myself and I could'ntkeep on pretending

[Chorus:]
Reborn
Making me over again
Oh, reborn
Is this the start of the end?
Reborn
Paying the debt for my sins
I will take it to the grave
Cause then my soul I will save
Reborn

Right my name
[?]
And to erase the past
I need to end this in sight
I've turned over a new leaf
Made over a new me
I'm reborn

I've been reboorrrnnn, ooOOoohh, reborn
WhooOOaa, Oooh, yeah heyy reborn, whooOOoaa
(I've been touched by an angel
I've been touched) [x2]

[Chorus:]
Reborn
Making me over again
Oh, reborn
Is this the start of the end?
Reborn
Paying the debt for my sins
I will take it to the grave
Cause then my soul I will save
Reborn

Oh ohhh, yeah heyy, reborn

I've been touched
