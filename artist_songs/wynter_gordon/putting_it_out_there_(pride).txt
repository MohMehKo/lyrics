Alone in a room
Or out in the crowd
All that I see is you and me
We’re deeper than skin
We’re outside the box
Forever free

No need to keep it a secret
You only gotta believe in
Wherever we go
Whatever we do
We’ll always be true

[Chorus]
With pride in our hearts
We putting it out there
For everyone to see
It tears us apart
We putting it out there
You know you not alone
To fight it every moment
Tonight the world will know who we are
Putting it out there

I’m all wired up
There’s no coming down
I’m sure of the way that I’m feeling
There’s never enough, of what that I love
Like air to breath

No need to keep it a secret
You only gotta believe in
Wherever we go
Whatever we do
We’ll always be true

[Chorus]
With pride in our hearts
We putting it out there
For everyone to see
It tears us apart
We putting it out there
You know you not alone
To fight it every moment
Tonight the world will know who we are
Putting it out there

I'll bear, I'll bear
What I'll bear
We're out there (We're out there)
There, there, there

[Bridge]
We’re a harmony
Like angels singing a song
Maybe we’re meant to be
Just the way we are

[Chorus]
With pride in our hearts
We putting it out there
For everyone to see
It tears us apart
We putting it out there
You know you not alone
To fight it every moment
Tonight the world will know who we are
Putting it out there

Out there, out there, out there, out there
Because we’re a harmony, a harmony
We’re a harmony, a harmony, a harmony

Out there, out there, out there, out there, out there, out...
