Like honey to the bee
That's what you do to me
Like honey to the bee

Wow what I've got
Buzz me up
Pretty baby it's all hazy
I've gone crazy for you
Like a drug coming up
Never ready to give you up
Oh I must be drunk on your love

Lovely ocean makes me weak
Come, that's the air I think I'm falling for you
You got me buzzin
You got me buzzin
Come on where you'll do what you do
Just keep it coming
Don't stop
You got me drunk on your love
Now, second round
Going down
Come on baby, you're all so tasty
And I go crazy again
Little kiss, little touch
I'm not ready to give you up

Cause I must be drunk on your love

Lovely ocean makes me weak
Come, that's the air I think I'm falling for you
You got me buzzin
You got me buzzin
Come on where you'll do what you do
Just keep it coming
Don't stop
You got me drunk on your love

Come, that's the air I think I'm falling for you
You got me buzzin
You got me buzzin
Come on where you'll do what you do
Just keep it coming
Don't stop

Like honey to the bee
That's what you do to me
Like honey to the bee [x2]
