Give me love or leave me alone
If you have to struggle
Just take you right home
Give me your love or leave me alone
You don't have to worry
Just take you right home

Home
Home (oh, give it up)
Home
Home (give me love!)
Home (go on home)
Home (give me love...)

I love you, when I try for you
When I put myself on the side for you
And I cry for you and I'd kill for you
Something inside me died cuz you
That you couldn't tell the truth

My mama ain't raise me like that
My mama ain't raise me like that
My mama ain't raise me like that
My mama ain't raise me like that

Give me love give me love give me love
No resistance
And you can't take it back, once you give it
It's given
So go on home, go on home, go on home
So go on home, go on home, go on home
