I don't belong here
But I gotta place to go
It's a winding road,
It's the path I chose
On my own
There's no one to blame here
Maybe it's all my fault
Cause I closed the door,
Got off life support,
Now I'm right here alone

My picture stands in a frame,
In this empty house
You can call up on me,
I don't wanna be found!
I'm staying here
I, Like it right here!

When I get to the
I'll come bad again!
Though it seems hard to breathe,
Just hang on till then
I'm staying here
I, Like it right here!

Walking a distance,
My only remedy
For a weary heart
That has come so far,
On my own
I hear a knocking,
I hear you call my name
Wish you could give in,
Cause my hearts knocking

For comforts that I've known!
My picture stands in a frame,
In this empty house
You cm call up on me,
I don't wanna be found!
I'm staying here
I, Like it right here!

When I get to the
I'll come bad again!
Though it seems hard to breathe,
Just hang on till then
I'm staying here
I, Like it right here!

Never be too far so,
Don't make this so hard
Let me, me be free
To find,
What the future may hold
Don't make me apologize
Never be too far so,
Don't mate this so hard
I'll be the same,
My heart won't change!
Right or now,
I'm staying right here!
Right here!
Ooooh yeah!
Ooooh yeah!
Ooooh yeah!

Maybe my picture stands right...

My picture stands in a frame,
In this empty house
You can call up on me,
I don't wanna be found!
I'm staying here
I, Like it right here!

When I get to the
I'll come bad again!
Though it seems hard to breathe,
Just hang on till then
I'm staying here
I, Like it right here!

Right here, right here

I'll be right here
