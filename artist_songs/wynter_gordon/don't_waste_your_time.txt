You got my attention baby let you on a clue
Take me out to dinner got me hanging with your crew
Feeling on my booty baby look me in the eye
Tell me that I'm special and I'm gonna be your wife

You got me all up in your room and then your bed
And all the shit you're saying going to my head
You got me feeling like it's on
I'm thinking that you're sure
But right after we're done
I see you walking through the door like

Don't waste your time
Just let it go
You'll be just fine out there on your own
Don't waste your time
I'm never coming back
I'm too far gone

You can fool me once and then I let you fool me twice
Trust you with it dirty baby I'mma let my dice
But now you only hit cus what you do you do it good
and I want you to touch me like a stranger only could

You shot me in the heart like I'm a soldier
I used to want your love but now it's over
I'm actin like a dude I do it on a whim
You ruining my million I'mma ruin everything like damn

Don't waste your time (your time)
Just let it go
You'll be just fine out there on your own
Don't waste your time (your time)
I'm never coming back
I'm too far gone

(Ahaa, ahaa,ahaa)

Don't waste your time [x4]

Don't waste your time
Just let it go
You'll be just fine out there on your own
Don't waste your time
I'm never coming back
I'm too far gone
