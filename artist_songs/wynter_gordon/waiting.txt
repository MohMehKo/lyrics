You led me to believe
That some day we would be
More than a question mark
A possibility
We're living in denial
'Cos this just can't be true
I could still wait all my life
To die right next to you

I'll be waiting around for you
I'll be waiting around for you

I'll be holding on another day
Don't know how we gonna make it
But I know we can make it alright
All I know is there's no other way
Don't know how we gonna make it but I
Know we can make it alright

This ain't no sweet surprise
This love was filled with time
There's such a happiness
I feel it, it's alive

I've been waiting around for you
I've been waiting around for you

I'll be holding on another day
Don't know how we gonna make it
But I know we can make it alright
All I know is there's no other way
Don't know how we gonna make it but I
Know we can make it alright

At the moment I feel you in my heart
Yeah I feel it
I don't know where to start
Gotta get this [?]
I can't control it
If I can see it, still believe in

I'll be holding on another day
Don't know how we gonna make it
But I know we can make it alright
All I know is there's no other way
Don't know how we gonna make it but I
Know we can make it alright

I'll be holding on another day
Don't know how we gonna make it
But I know we can make it alright
All I know is there's no other way
Don't know how we gonna make it but I
Know we can make it alright
