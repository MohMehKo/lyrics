Hold up let it ring
Never mind that
Cause we need to talk about some things
Got alot of questions and
They need answering
I've been seeing things (like)
Lipstick on your shirt (shirt)
Staying late at work (work)
Now you're in the spotlight
Clock is ticking get it right
If you don't answer me properly you will be gone tonight
Boy you like to play a game
You're the one whos losing
I'm not feeling what your saying
This is when your time is up

Too long
You took too long to get it right
You're gone
You had your chance
And now you're done
Your clock ran out of time
Next contestants coming alright

Now you just gotta go (go)
Now you gotta go your time is up
I guess you didn't want it bad enough
You need to keep on talking
You can start walking (oh)
Now you just gotta go (go)
Now you gotta go your time is up
I guess you didn't want it bad enough
You need to keep on talking
You can start walking
Baby now your time's up

Hurts a little brighter
Ain't gonna cry no tears today
I'm a real winner (winner)
Cause you're on your way
And I gotta say
I'll be better off without ya
Baby I'll be good without ya
Boy you lose
Guess you weren't man enough
Not enough
To win this prize
Here's a tissue dry your eyes
Boy you like to play games
You're the one who's losing
I'm not feeling what your saying
This is when your time is up

Too long
You took too long to get it right

You had a good thing right infront of your eyes
Time to move onto another
Boy, your time is up

Baby it's a shame
What you didn't know is
You were playing a losing game
Bet you now you noticed
Time stands still for noone, noone
