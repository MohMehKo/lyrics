Hey, hey, holla at your girl, holla at your girl, holla at your girl

Baby this is crazy, what you wanna do?
I'd be lovers a fool, boy let me hold you down
It seems like we... who be keeping secrets
Cause you're talking me in circles every time we're speaking
Might as well be speechless, if you really want my love, say something
Cause lately you've been bugging and I think that you should share your thoughts with me, oh

Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say what you wanna say
Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, your fresh, your thought, your mind, time forgot
If you want me in your world, I'll let you holla at you girl, uh, holla at your girl
Uh, holla at your girl, uh, holla at your girl, holla at your girl

Don't stop, open your lips and say it loud
If it ain't then it ain't but I think we both know what this is about
You'll never know if you don't ask when you see me with another man
They will turn all back then we'll be all mad
So baby tell me that you like it, I'll keep it 100 what you promised won't fight it
Cause really you've been bugging me and I think that you should share your thoughts with me

Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say what you wanna say
Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, your fresh, your thought, your mind, time forgot
If you want me in your world, I'll let you holla at you girl, uh, holla at your girl
Uh, holla at your girl, uh, holla at your girl, holla at your girl

I've been looking all cute and I'm air force one, baby, I wish you'd say something
But you better holla at your girl if you think I'm the one, baby boy, we're frying
Every time I walk by, you're always acting childish
Why don't you just say what you really wanna say, baby? Oh

Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say what you wanna say
Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, your fresh, your thought, your mind, time forgot
