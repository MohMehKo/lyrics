Born in 91 in the native sun
Like a falling star transcending
It had just begun when the west was one
And the olden ways were abandoned

And there was no light and we were ok
And there were machines that'll keep us safe
And we had our bums, and we had our peace
And were like gods, we were living like kings
In our glory, the eagles flew up
In our glory, we gave ourselves a way

[Chorus:]
We set the world on fire
We set the fire standing right in the middle of it
We let the flames grow higher
We light the world on
We light the world on
We set the world on fire
We set the fire standing right in the middle of it
We let the flames grow higher
We light the world on
We light the world on fire

When the rock gets full, when the bombs, they blew
When we hid away in a canyon
No, we can't pretend, cuz we know our sin
But we just keep taking our chances

And there was no light and we were ok
And there are machines here to take our place
And there is no-one, and there is no peace
And we were playing god, we were living like kings

[Chorus]

Who's gonna comfort me?
Oh now oh now oh now
Who's gonna cry for me?
Oh now oh now oh now
When I'm on my knees
Calling out, calling out
Oh, now
Who's gonna set me free?
Oh now oh now oh now

[Chorus]
