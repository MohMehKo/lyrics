Lost souls
With no pulse
Wait with no home
You're not alone anymore

Iy iy iy iy iy, iy iy iy iy iy
And I curse under my breathe some unholy prophecy
Cause my face is god to of a sea people who don't dream
You reach, you play on my heartstrings
You bring me to my knees

[Hook:]
You have a hunger I
Feel so helpless
You have a heart that beats like mine
Oh so effortless
Those barbwire bracelets
You wear
Those barbwire bracelets
Are cutting me, cutting me

Throw
Stones
In the cold
Shake in my bones
You're not alone anymore

Iy iy iy iy iy, iy iy iy iy iy
And I curse under my breathe some unholy prophecy
Cause my face is god to of a sea people who don't dream
You reach, you play on my heartstrings
You bring me to my knees

[Hook:]
You have a hunger I
Feel so helpless
You have a heart that beats like mine
Oh so effortless
Those barbwire bracelets
You wear
Those barbwire bracelets
Are cutting me, cutting me
