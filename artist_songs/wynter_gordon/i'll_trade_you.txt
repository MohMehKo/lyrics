See I knew what was that you didn't have to say it
I tried to... but I heard it anyway
... needed to stay
So I thought that I could say the same
I like what we got going but I want more
She don't even know what she's staying for
If I could talk to her now I know just what I'll say
Listen to me, oh

And you don't want him anyway, why don't you just give him to me? To me
I really wanna know what you would say, I'll trade you
Give him to me and I'll give you my loving
He don't wanna be a... he loves me
And so he doesn't make you unhappy, I'll trade you

You got some nerve trying to be on a...
I've seen your house, seen your car, seen the way you live
I think that I should tell you that to get yourself together
Or you look up and next time you see him it will... to never
I bet you say that he don't love you no more
When you don't even give him what he's looking for
If I could talk to her right now I know just what I'll say
Listen to me, oh

And you don't want him anyway, why don't you just give him to me? 
You should just give him out
Since you don't want him anymore
I really wanna know what you would say, I'll trade you
Yeah, you better be happy with what you got, and hope and try to make it last
Give him to me and I'll give you my loving
He don't wanna be a... he loves me
You're gonna loose him, you're gonna loose him
And so he doesn't make you unhappy, I'll trade you

All I got in,.. and I wanna trade, I'll trade you, I'll trade you,
... hoped you, nothing you never said and you want the truth, I'll trade you
And I can't believe you lied to me, I could of sworn you said...

And you don't want him anyway, why don't you just give him to me? 
You really got me looking like a fool
I really wanna know what you would say, I'll trade you
Give him to me and I'll give you my loving,
He don't wanna be a... he loves me
And so he doesn't make you unhappy, I'll trade you

And you don't want him anyway, why don't you just give him to me?
I really wanna know what you would say, I'll trade you
Give him to me and I'll give you my loving,
He don't wanna be a... he loves me
And so he doesn't make you unhappy, I'll trade you
