I was your mistress,
Top of your hit-list,
I was your girl
It was July and,
I made a commitment,
I was your world
And then I grew distant,
I put up my fences
and said my goodbyes
I left you with questions,
Not many answers,
So many lies

I did a bad thing.

Lead you by the hand and let you go.
I know that I was wrong.

I did a bad thing.

Now I left you with a heartbreak, baby,
so I don't have to live the lie.
You can put all the blame on me,
Shame on me,
I don't deserve you.

Now I left you with a heartbreak, baby,
so you don't have to live the lie.
You can put all the blame on me,
Shame on me,
I don't deserve you.

So much confusion,
Like an illusion,
That was our past.
Like I'm on trial, 
I'm in denial,
It happened so fast.
I wish I was careful,
What I did was hurtful,
And I have regrets.
You didn't deserve it,
I wish I could take back some things that I said.

I did a bad thing.

Lead you by the hand and let you go. 
I know that I was wrong. 

I did a bad thing. 

Now I left you with a heartbreak, baby, 
So I don't have to live the lie. 
You can put all the blame on me, 
Shame on me,
I don't deserve you.

Now I left you with a heartbreak, baby, 
So you don't have to live the lie. 
You can put all the blame on me,
Shame on me, 
I don't deserve you. 

I'm not asking more.
I'm not acting more.
Things will be cool with you. 
Please don't shut the door.
Please don't shut the door.
Let's play friends again. 
Why can we end in bad,
But out the good?
Next time we'll be better than before. 

Now I left you with a heartbreak, baby, 
So I don't have to live the lie. 
You can put all the blame on me, 
Shame on me,
I don't deserve you. 

Now I left you with a heartbreak, baby 
So you don't have to live the lie 
You can put all the blame on me
Shame on me 
I don't deserve you
