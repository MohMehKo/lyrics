I can feel it in the air
I can feel the fire burning
I wish that you were mine
But I know I don't deserve it
And I'll be okay, if I make it til the morning
And I wanna scream it out, that I'm sorry but I'm not
Know this feeling is fond but I don't care
Now stands all alone, got me out here
And I'm up so high that I can't come down
All the beats so hot, yeah, beat so loud
And I'm crying out

[Chorus]
Open up your eyes and see the light
Let me take you out into the night
You're giving me the look, you want it
Uh! you've done it now

I take you apart and you want mine
I can melt your heart, you'll be all mine
Imma work it hard, til you got me, yeah you got me
Once you start me, don't stop me
Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me

I can see that you approve, so I'm gonna keep it coming
My body's doing nice and mama know you love it
Now you got me into the groove
This thing is up and running
Watching while I'm rolling it, baby I'm controlling it
Work that beat, and make me feel so alive
And I'm never gonna wanna say goodbye
Got me up in your arms for a while

[Chorus]
Open up your eyes and see the light
Let me take you out into the night
You're giving me the look, you want it
Uh! you've done it now

I take you apart and you want mine
I can melt your heart, you'll be all mine
Imma work it hard, til you got me, yeah you got me
Once you start me, don't stop me
Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me

[Bridge]
(Come to me boy) I'm gon' leave you wanting more
(five six saturday) you gon' make it home late
I set you straight, I'm never late, I've done it straight, I'm regular
I'm taking your body up to the party, a first class flight us and nobody

[Chorus]

I take you apart and you want mine
I can melt your heart, you'll be all mine
Imma work it hard, til you got me, yeah you got me
Once you start me, don't stop me
Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me
