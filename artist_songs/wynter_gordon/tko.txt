It's flies on my eyes, surprise, time to get high
6, 5 you're the right eyes, now bitch get your own guy
That's right, go to Shanghai,
Goodbye 4th of July
Hello got it took by
Feel safe, or die
Die, die you want this,
I'm Fucking your sister,
It's the way that you run it's the bump in your system
And what if you really, you want it, you take it
You turn it, you race it, you rock it, you chase it
What you think you gon' do? Huh?
What you think you gon' do? Huh?

You think you know, but you don't know shit

This is the life, the way, the way, the way
This is the way, the way, the way, the way

It's the way that you run it's the bump in your system
You owe me a run it's the base in your system
You [?] you bang bang, you want me, you take it
You turn it, you lace it, you want it, you chase it.

Surely must have lost her mind, she found it, break time
I'm Jordan, and Tom, 23 in a blur hot dawg
Double dose tomorrow never died,
I spot, pull up right up in her eye
Don't you see me coming all uá¹— in your nose
Don't you see me running? Got there
I'm lavish, I'm so faded,.. catch it outdated
Expired? I'm the mother-fucking boss you fired
I'm higher, and higher, taste chocolate, could die for
Or some bake-like shit, get off my dick
