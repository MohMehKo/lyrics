I don't know, who you are,
Anymore, you're a mystery now.
An unfamiliar face.
You gave up, on us all,
You lost hope, you're just taking up space,

You and your friends have turned to leeches,
Begging for money and giving sad speeches,
You used to be my hero.

When we were just kids, you used to want,
To grow up and be, to be somebody.
But then it got lost, your innocence,
And you don't remember where it went.

When we were just kids, you loved yourself,
You loved yourself.
When we were just kids, you loved yourself.

We all got hurt, we all cried,
You were not alone, we all had to survive.
I learned to forgive, let go of the pain,
But you're holding on, holding onto the past.

You give guilt trips like no other,
Left your kids without a mother,
You know, you used to be my hero.

When we were just kids, you loved yourself,
You loved yourself.
When we were just kids, you loved yourself.
