I see you in front of me
A thousand faces in the crowd
We're okay for the [?]
The music grows [?]
Ohh
Don't let them take away the love
It's the one thing that keeps us going strong
Keep it burning
Burning in your heart and soul
Can you feel it

[Chorus:]
Can you feel it
Feel it in the air tonight
Ohh
I can feel it
Feel it in the air tonight
Ohh

I will live for my music
And my music lives for me
And my blood is my dust down
It's the thump in my heart beat
Ohh
And when I play this song
I fly
It's the one emotion I just can't deny
It's my birth-right
It's my habitat
Can you feel it

[Chorus:]
Can you feel it
Feel it in the air tonight
Ohh
I can feel it
Feel it in the air tonight
Whoaaa
Oohh
One love
One heart
It's the universal language
If you believe it
Well let me be

If you feel it
Feel it in the air tonight
Ohhh
I can feel it
Feel it in the air tonight
Ohh
Can you feel it
Feel it in the air tonight
Ohh
I can feel it
Feel it in the air tonight
Ohhh
Can you feel it
Feel it in the air tonight
Ohh
