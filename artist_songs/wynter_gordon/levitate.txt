Stare at the light over me it's alright
And it's hanging
I wait for it to come down
Sound of my heart it's a lot beating faster
It's banging
I wait for it to slow down
Loud as I climb hear the voices behind
I keep climbing, oh I'm climbing
I'm not falling,

[Chorus:]
Levitate, give yourself away
We could be flying,
We might fly away
Levitate, give yourself away
We could be flying,
We might fly away, levitate

Fear in the air and I'm anxious and scared
But I'm rising
I think I'm gonna fall down
Moment to wait till I'm happy and safe
So I'm reaching, I think I need to come down
Burning down air in the way of it all
It's finding, I keep trying
This is flying, oh

[Chorus:]
Levitate, give yourself away
We could be flying,
We might fly away
Levitate, give yourself away
We could be flying,
We might fly away, levitate

Take me up, till I can't see the ground
Little people, look so small when I look down
Wanna go, so far away, out there in space
Floating away
Take me up, till I can't see the ground
Little people, look so small when I look down
Wanna go, so far away, out there in space
Floating away

[Chorus:]
Levitate, give yourself away
We could be flying,
We might fly away
Levitate, give yourself away
We could be flying,
We might fly away, levitate.
