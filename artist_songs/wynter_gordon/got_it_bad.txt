I hate being here
Without you
See you linger everywhere
And I doubt you know
How much I've come to care
About you
Baby about you

I was not prepared
At all for you
And I was not aware
That taken the far
Could mean a standing
Still in air
'Cause baby without you

I am never what I am
Never who I am
When I'm not with you

I think about you every day
Hear your voices on replay
Boy you got
Got me good
You should know
I got it bad
I can still picture your face
Even though your far away
Not together
But I remember
How it's feels in your embrace
I'm not ashamed to say
You got me good
I got it bad (bad, bad, bad)

I can't understand
The reason till I know
It makes no sense
'Cause it's so easy
When I get to hold your hand
But baby when I can't

I am never who I am
Without you

Think about you every day
Hear your voices on replay

Boy you got
Got me good
You should know
I got it bad
I can still picture your face
Even though your far away
Not together
But I remember
How it's feels in your embrace
I'm not ashamed to say
You got me good
I got it bad (bad, bad, bad)

I never knew
I could feel like this
You took my heart
And made me miss you so bad (bad, bad, bad)
I never felt anything so strong
When you're not here
Everything is wrong

My you got me good

I got it bad
I think about you every day
Hear your voices on replay
Boy you got
Got me good
You should know
I got it bad
I can still picture your face
Even though your far away
Not together
But I remember
How it's feels in your embrace
I'm not ashamed to say
You got me good
I got it bad (bad, bad, bad)

Uhhh ooh
Baby
I'm not ashamed to say
You got me good
I got it bad
Uuuh
Yeeeah
I got it bad
Bad, bad, baaad
