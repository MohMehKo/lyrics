Hugs and kisses
Thought that I could make you change your mind
Thought that I could make you mine

Dreams and wishes
I got so frustrated all the time
You could see it in my eyes

I knew you went home to her
And when you didn't call
I knew where you were

I felt every word you said
It tore right through my heart
(I should have known)
Boy I should have known it
And it don't make sense why I'm so torn apart
(I should have known)
When I should have known that
You would leave me on my own
But I guess I should've known

We have secrets
Stolen moments taken in the dark
Never thought it'd be so hard

Now I regret
Trusting my emotions from the start
Now that I know the way you are

I knew that you were with her
And when you didn't call
I know where you were

I felt every word you said
It tore right through my heart
(I should have known)
Boy I should have known it
And it don't make sense why I'm so torn apart
(I should have known)
When I should have known that
You would leave me on my own
But I guess I should've known

Should've known

Every word you said
It tore right through my heart
(I should've know)
Boy I should've known it
And it don't make sense why I'm so torn apart
(I should've known)
When I should've known that
You would leave me on my own
I'd be waiting all alone
'Cause you just left me on my own
But I guess I should've known
