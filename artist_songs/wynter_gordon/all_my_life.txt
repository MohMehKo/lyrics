I've been lost with no trace couldn't shake the image of your face.
Since we touched, I couldn't rest until I was in your arms again.
Like oh, oh I'm losin' control and oh, oh I think you should know woah.
You should know, you should know you were all (you were all) all my life.

[Chorus:]
You were all
My life [x8]
I can't eat, I can't sleep.
I can't dance til you're with me
Cuz you are all my life you are all my life.

I'm at war with my heart.
Boy you had me trippin from the start.
Dim the lights til it's dark.
All I want is to be in your arms.
Like oh, oh I'm losing control and oh, oh I think you should know

[Chorus]

In my eyes I see my head in your arms again.
You are all mine for all time.
Never let me down.
I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't dance til you're with me
cuz you are all my life you are all my life

[Chorus]
