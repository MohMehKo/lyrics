I want more than you give
If I'm yours please say it
Tell me why you're ashamed
Why I'm not good enough to claim

You tell them that you love me
Or I just can't give it away
(Keep it hush no way, no way
Keep it hush no way, no way)

Tell them that you love me
Or I just can't give it away
(Keep it hush no way, no way
Keep it hush no way, no way)

You love me [x8]

Keep it hush no way, no way
Keep it hush no way, no way

You love me [x8]

You talk to me like I'm your girl
When you're halfway across the world
I'm your friend I mattered more
So I want it right I want it all

You tell them that you love me
Or I just can't give it away
(Keep it hush no way, no way
Keep it hush no way, no way)

Tell them that you love me
Or I just can't give it away
(Keep it hush no way, no way
Keep it hush no way, no way)

You love me [x8]

Keep it hush no way, no way
Keep it hush no way, no way

You love me [x8]

Keep it hush no way, no way
Keep it hush no way, no way

You're all that I want
Baby I just want you to say it
You're all that I need
Baby I just want you to claim it

You tell them that you love me
Or I just can't give it away
(Keep it hush no way, no way
Keep it hush no way, no way)

Tell them that you love me
Or I just can't give it away
(Keep it hush no way, no way
Keep it hush no way, no way)

You love me [x8]

Keep it hush no way, no way
Keep it hush no way, no way

You love me [x8]

Keep it hush no way, no way
Keep it hush no way, no way
