Like a moth to a flame
Trouble keeps on finding me
I’ve been hiding from my demons
All my prayers keep me breathing

Life is one big hypocrite
Like a knife against the skin
I’m a hostage in this skin
Had to help the weak ones live

So I’m running
I am running

Save me with your powers
Shower me with your wisdom and truth
Save me with your powers
I’ll give you the will of my body
I’ll train you, in the midnight hour
I wanna show you I’m willing
And I’m able
Save me with your powers
Shower me with your wisdom and truth oh

[Chorus:]
Stimela siembala nambalale
Sibele talaku
Stimela siembala nambalale
Sibele talaku tai...

And I go about my homes
I stood by and I watched you dance with the devil
I set up of bronze and gold
I sold out, I sold my soul
Only one place left to go
Oh I’m ready, I am ready

Save me with your powers
Shower me with your wisdom and truth,
I’ll give you the will of my body
I’ll train you, in the midnight hour
I wanna show you I’m willing
And I’m able
Save me with your ṗowers
Shower me with your wisdom and truth oh

[Chorus:]
Stimela siembala nambalale
Sibele talaku
Stimela siembala nambalale
Sibele talaku tai...

[Chorus:]
Stimela siembala nambalale
Sibele talaku
Stimela siembala nambalale
Sibele talaku tai
