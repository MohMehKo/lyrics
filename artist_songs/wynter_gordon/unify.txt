[Pre-Chorus:]
These Are
The Struggles That We Face
They Ain't Gon' Go Away
Until We Make A Change, So Far
We Haven't Done A Thing
But Sit Back And Complain, And Let
People Tell Us Who We Are

[Chorus:]
If We Wanna Make It Right
Come Together, Unify
Wanna Make A Better Life
Let Me Hear My People Cry
If We Wanna Make It Right
Come Together, Unify
Wanna Make A Better Life
Let Me Hear My People Cry

[Verse 1:]
I Keep A Watchful Eye, Over My Baby Brother
Responsibility, Every Woman Is A Mother
When There's No Father In The Picture 
It's Like He'll Go Astray (He'll Go Astray Yea)
He'll Chase His Dream
On The Big Silver Screen
Or The Court, Chances He'll Make The Team
A Thousand To One
And After That There's Nowhere To Turn
(Nowhere To Turn)

[Pre-Chorus:]
These Are
The Struggles That We Face
They Ain't Gon' Go Away
Until We Make A Change, So Far
We Haven't Done A Thing
But Sit Back And Complain, And Let
People Tell Us Who We Are

[Chorus:]
If We Wanna Make It Right
Come Together, Unify
Wanna Make A Better Life
Let Me Hear My People Cry
If We Wanna Make It Right
Come Together, Unify
Wanna Make A Better Life
Let Me Hear My People Cry

[Verse 2:]
Poverty Is Where We Grow
Videos Are All We Know
Get A Bitch
Now Drive A Whip
And Turn A Trick
We Love Them Hoes
The Only Way To Make A Dollar
Selling Weed Up On The Corner
Killing Future Son And Daughters Lives
Violence And Drugs And Gangs
More Models In Magazines
Having Sex And Pregnant Teens
It's What We Do, It Ain't No Thing
That's How We Spend Our Money Fast
Should Be Making Money Last
Instead We Spend It On Chinese Food And The Lastest Trends

[Pre-Chorus:]
These Are
The Struggles That We Face
They Ain't Gon' Go Away
Until We Make A Change, So Far
We Haven't Done A Thing
But Sit Back And Complain, And Let
People Tell Us Who We Are

[Chorus:]
If We Wanna Make It Right
Come Together, Unify
Wanna Make A Better Life
Let Me Hear My People Cry
If We Wanna Make It Right
Come Together, Unify
Wanna Make A Better Life
Let Me Hear My People Cry

[Bridge:]
All Those Who Succeed
Need To Help The Others
No Man Left Behind
In Spirit He's Your Brother
You Are Not Alone
If We Stick Together
Sun Or Stormy Weather
Baby Keep Your Head Up
All Those Who Succeed
Need To Help The Others
No Man Left Behind
In Spirit He's Your Brother
You Are Not Alone
If We Stick Together
Sun Or Stormy Weather
Let Me Hear My People Cry

[Pre-Chorus:]
These Are
The Struggles That We Face
They Ain't Gon' Go Away
Until We Make A Change, So Far
We Haven't Done A Thing
But Sit Back And Complain, And Let
People Tell Us Who We Are

[Chorus:]
If We Wanna Make It Right
Come Together, Unify
Wanna Make A Better Life
Let Me Hear My People Cry
If We Wanna Make It Right
Come Together, Unify
Wanna Make A Better Life
Let Me Hear My People Cry [x2]

I Wanna Hear You Cry
I Wanna Hear You Cry
I Wanna Hear You Say I Wanna Make A Change
I Wanna See You Pick Up And Do Things
I Wanna See You Make A Change
I Wanna See You Help Out Your Brother
Ooooo...
