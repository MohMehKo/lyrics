From the earth to the moon to the stars
Babe you know that I will be were ever you are.
Mountain high valley low on the go,
Baby you ma every thing wanna give you any thing. Yea
Just for you I would swim to the sea,
Hold ma breath cause I know you would do it for me.
I could search from the east to the west,
Baby girl you are the best, far apart from all the rest

[Chorus:]
In these words that I speak tonight,
I'll be with you till we see the light,
In these words that I speak today,
I will follow you come lead the way
I promise I won't hurt you,
I'm gone take away the pain.
Take you from the storm, and
Give you shelter in the rain.
Ohh, yea, yea, yea
Ohh, yea, yea, yea
Promise to be strong in times when ever you are weak
Guide you through the darkness
Babe I'm there for you when you can't see
Ohh, yea, yea, yea,
In the sanctuary

Ohh, yea, yea, yea
In the sanctuary
Through the wind, through the fire, through the flood
I would travel many miles just so I could see you smile, baby
You're my prince, you're my knight, you're my king
Your here to cater to
Just want to pamper you
I adore every thing that you are
Love the way your body curves, love your hips I love your swerves
It's your touch, it's the way that you feel when your lying next to me
There's no place I'd rather be

[Chorus:]
In these words that I speak tonight,
I'll be with you till we see the light,
In these words that I speak today,
I will follow you come lead the way
I promise I won't hurt you,
I'm gone take away the pain.
Take you from the storm, and
Give you shelter in the rain.
Ohh, yea, yea, yea
Ohh, yea, yea, yea
Promise to be strong in times when ever you are weak
Guide you through the darkness
Babe I'm there for you when you can't see
Ohh, yea, yea, yea,
In the sanctuary
Ohh, yea, yea, yea
In the sanctuary

[Bridge:]
Baby you know I'm so in love
I don't want to have to find another [x2]
I promise I won't hurt you,
I'm gone take away the pain.
Take you from the storm, and
Give you shelter in the rain.
Ohh, yea, yea, yea
Ohh, yea, yea, yea
Promise to be strong in times when ever you are weak
Guide you through the darkness
Babe I'm there for you when you can't see
Ohh, yea, yea, yea,
In the sanctuary
Ohh, yea, yea, yea
In the sanctuary
