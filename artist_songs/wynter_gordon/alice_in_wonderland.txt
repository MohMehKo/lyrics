I'm Alice, this is your wonderland!
Come on everybody my roller coaster is almost leavin'
Oooh whoohoo...
And we could take a ride through the night to my magic kingdom
Oooh whoohoo...
Your own castle in sky, where it feels like you just died and
Went to heaven
Oooh whoohoo...
And there's milion reasons why you choose to say behind, but just
Forget 'emmm
Oooh whoohoo...
Follow the leader, into the rabbit hole, I'm gonna lead ya into
Another world, where the lights don't matter, stars all gather

I'm Alice, this is your wonderland!
Follow the leader into the rabbit hole, I'm gonna lead you into
Another world, where the lights don't matter, stars all gather
I'm Alice, this is your wonderland!

You can see the sun to the left outside your window
Oooh whoohoo...
Final destination for this evening is wherever your mind goes
Oooh whoohoo...
Great adventures to be had, cause the meter on the cab is broken
Oooh whoohoo...
Where the candy house is real, you can taste it if your mouth is
Open
Oooh whoowhoo...
Follow the leader into the rabbit hole, I'm 'bout to lead you into another
World, where the lights don't matter, stars all gather

I'm Alice, this is your wonderland!
Follow the leader into the rabbit hole, I'm gonna lead you into another
World, where the lights don't matter, stars all gather

I'm Alice, this is your wonderland!

Fame into the rabbit hole, where feathers on the creatures glow
Glostop by for a spot of tea
A table's set for you and me
Down here with the wild things, and who knows what the wild brings
Purple fat kitty cat, never mind where you at
OH

Ooh... oooh... oooh... oooh... OOOHHH!
Follow the leader into the rabbit hole, I'm gonna lead you into another
World, where the lights don't matter, stars all gather

I'm Alice, this is your wonderland!
Follow the leader into the rabbit hole, I'm gonna lead you into another
World, where the lights don't matter, stars together

I'm Alice, this is your wonderland!
Follow the leader into the rabbit hole, I'm gonna lead you into another
World, where the lights don't matter, stars all gather

I'm Alice, this is your wonderland!
