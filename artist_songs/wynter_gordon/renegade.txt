I had a boyfriend
He was such a lazy lover
A disappointment underneath the covers
I wanted more so I grabbed the keys
I threw down my map
Flipped my hair to the breeze

I'm on a mission to get in a position
Never done before
I played it straight as a good good girl for far too long
And them other fellas ask if I'm somebodys wife
I look at them like oh no
This is my reply

I'm a renegade
Go and don't take me out your mouth
Noone owns this see noone touches that
You gotta ask me to try it once
If I don't like it I'm a send him back
And then move on move on move on
And then groove on groove on groove on
And then move on move on move on
And then groove on groove on groove on

I'm a renegade ohh
I'm a renegade ohh

Exhibition I'm retro erotic
It's the new me since I kicked the habit
I'm a woman I like to be touched
I'm over the guilt and I'm down for free love

I'm on a mission to get in a position
Never done before
I played it straight as a good good girl for far too long
And them other fellas ask if I'm somebody's wife
I look at them like oh no
This is my reply

I'm a renegade
Go and don't take me out your mouth
Noone owns this see noone touches that
You gotta ask me to try it once
If I don't like it I'm a send him back
And then move on move on move on
And then groove on groove on groove on
And then move on move on move on
And then groove on groove on groove on

I'm a renegade ohh
