Back-back-b-ba-back. Backstabber! [x4]

{Oooooh yeaah}

Girls, watch your boyfriends, there she goes again.
Walking like she owns the place, all up in your face.
Boys will be sucked in, she might look innocent.
But like a mantis, might be your last kiss.

You better get a clue, it's not about you. {Hey!}
She'll take anyone to bed if it helps her get ahead.

You better get a clue, you're always gonna lose. {Yeah!}
She's breaking bones, you're just a stepping stone.

She's a backstabber. Anything to climb the ladder.
Backstabber, she's like a vertebrate.

Backstabber, she'll have your heart on a platter.
She's out for number one, if you see her, run the other way.

Back-back-b-ba-back. Backstabber! {back~}

She's on a mission, she's got you in her sides.
She'll have you wishing you could see the apatites.

Looks so sweet, hypnotized by the view.
But by tomorrow night, you're yesterday's news.

You better get a clue, it's not about you. {No!}
She's gonna use you up, she can never get enough.

You better get a clue, you're always gonna lose. {Yeah!}
She's breaking bones, your're just a stepping stone.

She's a backstabber. Anything to climb the ladder.
Backstabber, she's like a vertebrate.

Backstabber, she'll have your heart on a platter.
She's out for number one, if you see her, run the other way.

Thought you were my friend, soon as I turn around,
You're up on him dancing, and talking it out.

I got your number, I know what you're about.
You're just a backstabber, you're gonna get it now.
