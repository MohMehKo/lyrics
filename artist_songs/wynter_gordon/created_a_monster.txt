What do you want now
Haven't I given you everything
I spoiled, You rotten
And now you want more from me
Your stressing my pockets
Plus I gave you my soul
I stocked your closet
I'm too emotional

It's all my fault, I can't complain
chivalry's dead, and I'm to blame
I've played the independent woman for too long
I'm wanna let you be the man from now on
And you're set in your ways now I'm stuck
And you worn my mistakes its too much
I've been the independent woman for too long
Tell me where I went wrong
I created a monster

How did this get so far
How did I let this happen (monster)
Women, we go so hard
Making all kind of exceptions (monster)
Giving him all of me
Thinking he'd love me more (I created a monster)
Soon I'll have to let him go
I'm so sad
I created a monster

What kind of guy are you to encourage me to be a supplier
You never give back anything
You live in my apartment
And got the keys to my car
You only say I Love You when you need something more

But it's all my fault, I can't complain
Chivalry's dead, and I'm to blame
I've played the independent woman for too long
I wanna let you be a man from now on
And you set in your ways now I'm stuck
And you worn my mistakes its too much
I've been the independent woman for too long
Tell me where I went wrong
I created a monster

How did this get so far
How did I let this happen (monster)
Women, we go so hard
Making all kind of exceptions (monster)
Giving him all of me
Thinking he'd love me more (I created a monster)
Soon I have to let him go
I'm so sad
I created a monster

I enabled you to be so dependent on me
Why you pulled me deeper
You never let me stop
You shoulda coulda woulda
If you did we'd have a shot
I cannot lie
I really liked you
It's just so bad I gotta cut you loose
And I wished I could hold you responsible

But It's all my fault
I can't complain
Chivalry's dead, and I'm to blame
I've played the independent woman for too long
I wanna let you be the man from now on
And you set in your ways now I'm stuck
And you worn my mistakes its too much
I've been the independent woman for too long
Tell me where I went wrong
I created a monster

How did this get so far
How did I let this happen (monster)
Women, we go so hard
Making all kind of exceptions (monster)
Giving him all of me
Thinking he'd love me more
I created a monster
Soon I have to let him go
I'm so sad I created a monster
I created a monster

I enabled you to be so dependent on me
I created a monster
I created a monster
I created a monster
