These little white lies
Sometimes necessary
Cause when I tell the truth
It can be kinda scary
I don't wanna deal with your
Reaction
A slap to the face won't leave much satisfaction

Take my tongue and tie it in a knot
Use it as a pillow for the shock
(You can) swear at me with everything you got
But if I told you I would break your heart

Just so you know
This, is the last time that I lie to you
I will not run over myself for you
This is the last time

Suck it up like water on a mop
Make it like in bed when I'm on top
Counting every single second on the clock
Knowing I’ll wake up soon, I’ll stop 

Just so you know
This, is the last time that I lie to you
I will not run over myself for you

Just so you know
This, is the last time that I lie to you
I will not run over myself for you

[Instrumental Break]

Just so you know
This, is the last time that I lie to you
I will not run over myself for you

Just so you know
This, is the last time that I lie to you
I will not run over myself for you

Just so you know
This, is the last time that I lie to you
I will not run over myself for you
