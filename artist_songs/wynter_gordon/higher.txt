Take me high
Get me up so high that I could never fall down low
I think about it all the time
but I gotta grow up, gotta show up I know
but I wanna fly, so high up that I'm never coming down
but every time it's so hard to get my feet up
off the ground.
but maybe tomorrow

I'm gonna fly away, I'm gonna find a way
and when I leave this town, I'm gonna be ok
I got nothing to lose, I got nothing to do
I gotta make a move, I gotta make a move... higher

Spent my life, spent all my life just trying to survive this fight.
I think about it and I cry, cause I don't know why the wind blows or where it goes
but I'm gonna try , gonna try to find my way
before it crumbles down
but every time it's so hard to get my feet up
off the ground.
but maybe tomorrow

I'm gonna fly away, I'm gonna find a way
and when I leave this town, I'm gonna be ok
I got nothing to lose, I got nothing to do
I gotta make a move, I gotta make a move... higher

And you fall for it all
And you live by the rules
And you work till you die
When you know it's a lie
And you bleed for it
And you bleed for it
