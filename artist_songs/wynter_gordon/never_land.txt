Never never land
Mmmm
Never never land
Yeah

Tell me have you ever wished
That broken hearts could be whole again
Is there such a place where rain never falls
And everything wrong turns right
Tell me have you seen that world
Where nobody cries cause there's never lies.
Where everybody finds that innocence once again
Where love don't die

I'll follow the stars in your eyes
I'm hoping they'll guide me
I'll give you my hand and we'll fly
Please fly

Can you take me to the place I dream about
Where I don't have to be afraid cause you're around
Yeah with every single kiss my heart believes
It feels like time stands still when you're with me
Never never land
Oh never never land

You're the one I want to trust
Cause it feels so right just the two of us
This paradise that's found in every embrace
That I'll never have to face alone
Tell me what you're waiting for
There's something here that we can't ignore
And I never ever want to find my way back
To anything bad I've known

Let's follow the star to the right
I know that it'll guide us
I'll give you my hand and we'll fly
Please fly

Can you take me to the place I dream about
Where I don't have to be afraid cause you're around
Yeah with every single kiss my heart believes
It feels like time stands still when you're with me
(Never never land
Oh never never land) [x2]

Can you take me oh yeah
I want to see those skies yeah
Show me that secret place that you hide away
Wanna know wanna go there
Can you take me oh yeah
I want to see those skies yeah
Show me that secret place that you hide away
Wanna know wanna know

Can you take me to the place I dream about
Where I don't have to be afraid cause you're around
Yeah with every single kiss my heart believes
It feels like time stands still when you're with me
Never never land
Oh never never land
Never never land
Oh never never land
Never never land

Can you take me oh yeah
