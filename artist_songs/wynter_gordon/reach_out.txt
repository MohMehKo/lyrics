[Verse 1:]
Can't escape the feeling lingering pain
And we played the game night and day
Picking all the pieces of another life
There is nothing left to hide

[Pre-Chorus:]
O-o-oh, o-o-oh, I apologize
O-o-oh, o-o-oh forgive me

[Chorus:]
Break me out from this prison
Don't you leave me all alone
Tell me I am the only one
No way, I'm screaming now
Reach out, reach out
Reach out and touch my hand
Touch my, hold my, hold my
Hold my, hold, hold

[Verse 2:]
Closing off the scene of a hurtful crime
I can recognize, this is mine
Now we're face to face, look me in the eye
Tell me all that's wrong, and I won't deny

[Chorus:]
Break me out from this á¹—rison
Don't you leave me all alone
Tell me I am the only one
No way, I'm screaming now
Reach out, reach out
Reach out and touch my hand
Touch my, hold my, hold my
Hold my, o-oh-oh
