Right now if I was a fortune teller
I could see beyond the stars
The cards would have a picture, with your face on it
I see signs everything leads to you
I'm walking in your direction I'm feeling this new sensation, Yea

You taste like hunger
You feel like urgency
You make me wonder
You sound so good to me

So if I am wrong
If I am right
Make me a believer
Before I leave here tonight
Make me a believer

I'm a believer [x2]

Over time, it's natural selection
We exist to love
But love is not perfection
So we try

You taste like hunger
You feel like urgency
You make me wonder
You sound so good to me

So if I am wrong
If I am right
Make me a believer
Before I leave here tonight
Make me a believer

I'm a believer [x3]
