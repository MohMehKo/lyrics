[Talking:]
I don't understand
What did I do to make you so suspicious of me?
I've been faithful
See...
If you can't back up
You can leave!

[Verse 1:]
You can't expect to rope me like your others
Waitin' to catch me so you watch me close
You need to take me from under your microscope
Trust you won't find nothing... there's something

If you're not careful I'll be M.I.A.
Stay double checking, why you so suspicious of me?
This paranoia about to make me make you vacate
That's what I said, yeah that's what I said

[Chorus:]
All in my way-ay-ay
In my spa-ace
Dealing with your head-aches
Giving me a head-ache
I can't take it
Give me my privacy
Fall back and let me breathe
Don't keep me under surveillance

[Verse 2:]
I'm on your radar, there's no escaping your range
There's no mystery, there ain't no case to solve
I'm not the enemy, I'm on your side could you
Quit searching, let down your guard

If you're not careful I'll be M.I.A. (M.I.A.)
Stay double checking, why you so suspicious of me? (Suspicious of me)
This paranoia about to make me make you vacate (Me make you vacate)
That's what I said (Yeah), yeah that's what I said (What I said)

[Chorus:]
All in my way-ay-ay
In my spa-ace
Dealing with your head-aches
Giving me a head-ache (Giving me a headache now)
I can't take it
Give me my privacy (Oh oh oh)
Fall back and let me breathe (Oh oh oh)
Don't keep me under surveillance

[Bridge:]
(Why you keep me under)
Why you keep on surveillance (Oooh)
Why you watching all the time (Oh oh ooh)
Through the night
Can I get some room
Can I took your mind?
Why you keep me on surveillance (Can I)
Why you watching all the time
All the night

All in, all in, all in, all in...

[Chorus:]
All in my way-ay-ay (Ohh ooooh)
In my spa-ace
Dealing with your head-aches
Giving me a head-ache (Giving me a)
I can't take it (Oohhh)
Give me my privacy (Privacy)
Fall back and let me breathe (Let me breathe)
Don't keep me under surveillance (Keep me under wooooah)

All in my way-ay-ay (In my way)
In my spa-ce (In my space)
Dealing with your headaches (The headaches)
Giving me a headache
I can't take it (I can't take it no)
Give me my privacy (My privacy)
Fall back and let me breathe (And let me breathe)
Don't keep me under surveillance (Surveillance)
