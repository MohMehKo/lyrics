After you feel it,
You're never the same again.
After you've seen it,
You'd wish you'd have never learned.
And after you feel it,
You're never the same again.
And after you taste it,
You just won't stop giving in.

Oh all the time,
I have wasted trying.
Searching blind,
Hard to find.
No one knows,
What it is until it reveals.
Then you don't know,
How you'll live without it.

Once you start, you can never stop [x4]

After you feel it,
You're never the same again.
After you've seen it,
You'd wish you'd have never learned.
And after you feel it,
You're never the same again.
And after you taste it,
You just won't stop giving in.

Oh this is bliss,
Better than the rest.
What I missed,
No contest.
I feel safe,
satisfied, and secure.
To sit back,
And watch you mature.

Once you start,
You can never stop [x4]

After you feel it,
You're never the same again.
After you've seen it,
You'd wish you'd have never learned.
And after you feel it,
You're never the same again.
And after you taste it,
You just won't stop giving in.

After you feel it,
You're never the same again.
After you've seen it,
You'd wish you'd have never learned.
And after you feel it,
You're never the same again.
And after you taste it,
You just won't stop giving in.
