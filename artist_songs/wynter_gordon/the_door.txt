I Tried To
Tried To Show You
How Good Our Love Could Be, You
Gave Nothing Back To Me And
I Gave You So Many Chances
To Turn It Around
Now All Your Chances Have Run Out

Now There'll Be No One Last Time
There's No More One Last Tries
This Time You've Pushed Your Love Too Far
And I've Got No Time For You No More
I Showed You Love, Now I'm Showing You The Door

So Pack Up, Get Up
Get Outta My Life
Go On, Get Gone
Get Outta My Sight
Cause I'm Thru, With You
Got No Room For You No More
I Showed You Love, Now I'm Showing You The Door

You Should Have
Tried To Give Back
The Love That I Gave To You
You Did Not Bother To, And
I Should Have
Known That You Were Never Gonna Change
It's Too Late For Changes Anyways, Cause

There'll Be No One Last Time
There's No More One More Try
Your One Last Chance Has Come And Gone
And I Don't Want You Around No More
I Showed You Love, Now I'm Showing You The Door

So Pack Up, Get Up
Get Outta My Life
Go On, Get Gone
Get Outta My Sight
Cause I'm Thru, With You
Got No Room For You No More
I Showed You Love, Now I'm Showing You The Door

So Don't Trip On Your Way Out
Don't Think About Getting Back With Me
Cause It's Over
Baby We're Thru
The Only Sound You'll Hear
Is My Heart Slamming Shut On You
{So Pack Uuuupppppp}

So Pack Up, Get Up
Get Outta My Life
Go On, Get Gone
Get Outta My Sight
Cause I'm Thru, With You
Got No Room For You No More
I Showed You Love, Now I'm Showing You The Door
