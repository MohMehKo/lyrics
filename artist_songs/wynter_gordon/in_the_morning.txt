Take me back,
Take me back.

I'm going home alone tonight,
You were with your friends and that's alright,
Cos they all, hit on me,
When your not looking, huh.

I'm a little sad to see you go,
Can you laugh and now I gets the joke,
Your problem, is tiny,
So it's so funny.

You took a real big chance,
And you gave me up,
I swear I was your friend baby,
I was your love,
And I admit, that I liked you too,
But you needed me, more than I needed you.

It's okay cos you'll be sorry in the morning,
Yeah it's okay cos I already hear you calling,
This is a game, that we play, that you always lose,
miserably, you'll be begging take me back,
In the morning, in the morning.

Take me back,
Take me back.

Lying in my bed there's so much space,
And you move your things here (in place),
Let the day, sheets pile up,
With the laundry.

And I have done my best to make it work,
Why you try your best to be a jerk,
I deserve, an award, 
For my patience.

You took a real big chance,
And you gave me up,
I swear I was your friend baby,
I was your love,
And I admit, that I liked you too,
But you needed me, more than I needed you.

It's okay cos you'll be sorry in the morning,
Yeah it's okay cos I already hear you calling,
This is a game, that we play, that you always lose,
miserably, you'll be begging take me back,
In the morning, in the morning.
