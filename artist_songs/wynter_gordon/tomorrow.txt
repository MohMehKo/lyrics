Under the burning sun,
Place that we call home,
Watch the sky fall down,
Let tomorrow come,
Let tomorrow come.

Don't turn away from me,
I want you to look me in these eyes,
And don't play the fool with me
I see through you in the darkest light.

So don't turn away,
No, no, no
I'll be here waiting,
No don't turn away
No, no, no
I'll be here

Under the burning sun,
Place that we call home,
Watch the sky fall down,
Let tomorrow come,
Under the burning sun,
Place that we call home,
Watch the sky fall down,
Let tomorrow come.

Say that you'll fight for me,
Cus hope doesn't bleed in black or white,
The fire that burns in me,
Desire to love in all mankind.

So don't turn away,
No, no, no
I'll be here waiting,
No don't turn away
No, no, no
Cus I'll be here

Under the burning sun,
Place that we call home,
Watch the sky fall down,
Let tomorrow come,
Under the burning sun,
Place that we call home,
Watch the sky fall down,
Let tomorrow come.

[Salomon Faye's verse]
As graceful as when a bird flies,
High vibes from the first high,
The second I peep with my third eye,
You the moon and the sunrise
The reason I fly through chaotic times and still harmonize,
Aren't we in harmony, Karma and me, girl you like a Ganja leaf,
Needed be, I need you to believe in me,
So I can stay with you like I'm leaving me,
Leaps, of faith cus that's all that it takes
To elevate the good to the great,
The great to the bliss,
I'm taking a kiss,
And with a taste of your lips,
I be making a wish
That when the hard times hit we stay fit
And don't get stressed,
Walk with me through the storm and you won't get wet,
As the love gets strong and the sorrow numbs,
Watch the sky fall down as tomorrow comes.

Under the burning sun,
Place that we call home,
Watch the sky fall down,
Let tomorrow come,
Under the burning sun,
Place that we call home,
Watch the sky fall down,
Let tomorrow come,
Let tomorrow come,
Let tomorrow come,
Let tomorrow come.
