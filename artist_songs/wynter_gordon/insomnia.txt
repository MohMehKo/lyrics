Don't eat, no matter how tired
I can't sleep, I can't stop thinking why we can't make it work
Compromise, cause I deserve it

In my bed, tossing and turning
In my head, fire still burning,
Like the first, day we met
The way we were, just can't forget it

I wish, we could just be like so what
Apologize and keep going
Made mistakes but we're strong enough
To be moving on... alone

Nights just seem so long
There's too much time to think about it
My head is overcrowded and and ohhh
Everything seems so wrong, stuck in this prison
I'm here living alone, I have insomnia

I'd pop pills if it could help me
But still, I find myself sinking deeper in thoughts of you
Why the hell am I trippin'

You're home, just stringing [?]
I'm here, not breathing
Cause I can't close my eyes
Can't turn it off, it's happened enough

I wish, we could just be like so what
Apologize and keep going
Made mistakes but we're strong enough
To be moving on... alone

Nights just seem so long
There's too much time to think about it
My head is overcrowded and and ohhh
Everything seems so wrong, stuck in this prison
I'm here living alone, I have insomnia

Uh huhh... uh huhh... ohh
Uhh uhhh... uh huhhh
I'm not sleeping, I'm not resting
I'm right here on my own

Nights just seem so long
There's too much time to think about it
My head is overcrowded and and ohhh
Everything seems so wrong, stuck in this prison
I'm here living alone, I have insomnia

Alone, Nights just seem so long
There's too much time to think about it
My head is overcrowded and and ohhh
Everything seems so wrong, stuck in this prison
I'm here living alone, I have insomnia
