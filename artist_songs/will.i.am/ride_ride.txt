[John Legend]
Hey... hey... hey... hey... 
Hey you, yeah you with the tight blue jeans 
Little shorty 'bout five foot three 
...with the long-ass weave, girl please 
Allow me, to come thru and introduce myself 
Let me tell you how the Legend was built 
I look nice, and I sing real swell, damn well 

[will.i.am - imitating some girl name Charice]
Nigga please, better learn how to speak to me 
Need to say my name properly 
That's Charice spelled with a C, now leave 
Cause I don't, got time for a nigga that's broke 
Still rockin that Shalin coat 
Wearin fashion that's three years old, oh no 

[John Legend]
Slow down, you're dealin with a big dog now 
Lemme tell you how a playa get down 
If you want to talk about my style, say wow 
That's right, that truck over there is mine 
And baby girl if you act real nice 
Later on we can take it for a ride, in my ride 

[Chorus]
Ride ride ride ride, ride 
Ride ride ride ride, ride 
Ride ride ride ride, ride 
Let's riiiiiiide

[charice.i.am]
Say word, later on I don't know if you heard 
It's jumpin off at 1st & 3rd 
Come early cause the line's absurd, yeah word 

[John Legend]
Okay, hit me up later on today 
Leave a message on my two-way 
I'ma go get a barbershop fade, a tight fade 

[charice.i.am]
Well let's meet, at the deli on 23rd Street 
9:30 to get a bite to eat 
Save room for a special treat, it's real sweet 

[John Legend]
Nah mean, now we's about to get obscene 
Lemme tell you somethin about them jeans 
I peel 'em off like a tangerine, strip clean 

[charice.i.am]
Is that a fact? You talkin like a real live mack 
With the old school Cadillac 
With three chicks and a mink in the back, I like that 

[John Legend]
Well, alright, now you talkin that language I like 
I got a feelin that it's on tonight 
Buck wild 'til the broad daylight, that's right 

[Chorus]

[Outro: will.i.am]
La la, la-la-la-la-la 
La la, la-la-la-la-la 
La la, la-la-la-la-la
La la, la-la-la-la-la 
La la, la la la-la-la-la
La la, la-la-la-la-la 
La la, la-la-la-la-la 
La la, la-la-la-la-la 
La la, la la la-la-la-la, la la
