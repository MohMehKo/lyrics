[WILL.I.AM]
From Delaware to Tennesse to Hawaii 
From mountain tops 
We have dreams from sea to shining sea 
and now here we are 

[FAITH HILL]
We have come 
we have prevailed 
who so ever dreamed, this is your will 
Here we are 
Here we are 

[SEAL (FAITH HILL)]
At the dawn, 
At the morning 
Of a brand new day (a brand new day) 
For all (for all) 
In the spirit of our fathers 

[SEAL, FAITH HILL, WILL.I.AM]
America 
America 
America is beautiful (beautiful, yes it is) 
My America 
Your America 
Our America is beautiful 

[SEAL, FAITH HILL]
And may God (may God) 
Keep us together 
Cause America (America) 
Is beautiful (beautiful) 

[BONO]
May liberty and justice ring for all 
Let your dreams stand tall 
May opportunities fall upon you 
In the land of the free 
MARY J. BLIGE 
We have come 
And we have prevailed 
Who so ever dreamed, this is your will 
And here we are

[BONO (MARY J BLIGE)]
At the stars 
And the risen 
Of a brand new day (of a brand new day) 
For all (for all) 
In the spirit of the fathers (spirit of the fathers)
