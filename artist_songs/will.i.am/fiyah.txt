You can't touch me
I'm too, too, too, too high up
You can't touch me
I'm about to, to, to, to rise up
Look at me, look at me, look at me
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah

I'm on fiyah

I woke up like this
I'm buttoned up like this

All I wanna do is burn it up like this
I stay like that
Loco, straight cray like that
