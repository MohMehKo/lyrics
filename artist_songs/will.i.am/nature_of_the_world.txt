[Chorus]
[Justin Timberlake]
The nature of the world today
The nature of the world today
The nature of the world today
The nature of the world today

[Will.I.Am]
Stop, stop,stop
Stop smiling 'cos the way the world's moving's not funny,
School system conditioning your child to be a dummy, 
Ain't no education in education hunny,
School teacher's only rackin' up a little money,
T.V.'s raising kids in the new era,
And I don't see a prophet that'll prophesize it clearer,
Dayum if Christ comes back they'll probably kill him,
Crucify him twice just to keep the people from hearin',
The message that you and I should be hearin', 
The unhearable,
What I'm getting to is this world is somethin' terrible,
I've had it up to hear 'cos being blind's unbearable,
It sounds like I'm goin' deaf, 
So now I'll go hysterical,
'Cos living in a world that's not harmonius is deafening,
There's no life business but death is a profession,
You got morticians and coroners, exorcism performers,
But we ain't got nobody there positioned just to warn us of the
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum conditioning,
We gettin' elementary, it's funny how they put us in a dummy state o' mind,
A dummy state o' mind
I ain't smiling 'cos all they got is money on they mind,
That's the nature...

[Chorus]
The nature of the world today,
The nature of the world today,
The nature of the world today, 
The nature of the world today.

[Will.I.Am]
Money got me dog, money got you,
Money got you working just to pay off your coupe,
Money got the gas prices higher than ever,
The people runnin' money yo they gotta be clever because if you ain't got no money then you wanna get some,
People want money more than education,
And if you wanna education then you gotta pay to get it,
Money's the new God, if it ain't who is it?,
Looking back at the dollar, In God We Trust
Fuck that, money ain't God and money ain't us,
People will save a dime, people will save a dollar,
They hesitate to save a life if they hear a holler,
So holler, holler, holler if I'm hitting you with purity,
Homeland security is insecurity, secure the homeland with proper education,
Expand the minds of the youth and build up the nation,
And compete in a whole new world of technology,
We been brainwashed and tricked psychologically,
And we just consumers so go get ya money,
And buy a diamond ring for your honey,
But fuck that, I realise I'm shinin' like the sun,
Got enlightened and enlightened everyone,
I realise I'm shinin' like the sun,
Get enlightened and learn a little somethin' about the nature...

[Chorus]
[Justin Timberlake]
The nature of the world today,
The nature of the world today, 
The nature of the world today,
The nature of the world today,
