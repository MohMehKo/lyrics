Love will be the armor
Protect us from the pain
End our life, end our life.
Even when the storm comes,
We'll stand out in the rain,
Watch it slide, let it slide.

Here we stand against the world

You and I, we rock the lullaby
Make me feel alive, cause the love, it never die
Me put you long one,
Shot me down, we're foregone,
Ain't no need to worry, don't call 911.
Bang-bang, a lot of bang-bang,
Shoot me with your love, but we feelin' no pain.
Kill it, kill it baby with your loving, bang bang,
Baby, do it again.

[2x]
So shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet,
Such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet,
Go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it,
Shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet.

Even if you're mad at me
And fighting all the time
It's alright, it's alright.
I would risk my sanity
I would lose my mind
For one night, for one night.

Here we stand against the world

You and I, we rock the lullaby
Make me feel alive, cause the love, it never die
Me put you long one,
Shot me down, we're foregone,
Ain't no need to worry, don't call 911.
Bang-bang, a lot of bang-bang,
Shoot me with your love, but we feelin' no pain.
Got me feelin' lovely like it's morphine,
Baby, do it again.

[2x]
So shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet,
Such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet,
Go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it,
Shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet.
