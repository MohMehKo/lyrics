Calling individuals to realize the power
And falling the world poverty and end the world hunger
And forcing the politicians to keep with their promise
And making the world leaders and we'll leave the world honest
In my name

In the name of greed and gain
There's a lot of people that's suffering
There's a lot of people that's livin' in pain
And then there's folks that won't complain
That's the kinda stuff I just can't explain
So much injustice
Stuff's gotta change
People in poverty play by the game
That's why I believe on the track like rain
I believe for the love to bring up our change
I believe to inspire more people to maintain
Hold on strong, y'all
Try to sustain
Scream to the Government, we come with a plan
And rescue you from the flames
With the keys for your shackles and chains
Power that we should be all ashamed
For the people they're slayin'

In my name
In my name
In my name
In my name

Just calling individuals to realize the power
And falling the world poverty and end the world hunger
And forcing the politicians to keep with their promise
And making the world leaders and we'll leave the world honest
In my name

In my name
In my name
In my name
In my name

In the name of greed and gain
There's a lot of people that's sufferer
Too many children stuck up inside their box
No oxygen
Economic travesty
They say "Give a dollar every child can see"
I think what they need is new policies
A little bit of help from you and me

In my name

In the year of 2000, at the United Nations Millennium Summit, your leader promised to end extreme poverty by 2015. We only have 7 years left. Tell your leaders to act now to meet the millenium development goals. Create a video sayin' your name and your country and tell your leaders what you want them to change to end poverty. After you created your video, upload it to the inmyname (youtube.com/inmyname) channel, and we'll mash up the best ones and show 'em to the world leaders at the United Nations. Tell your leaders to act now.
