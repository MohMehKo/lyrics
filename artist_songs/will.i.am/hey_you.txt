[JOAN SEBASTIAN:]
Hey you, you in the mirror on the wall
Yes you, will you listen after all
I've been hurt, see my wound

[CHORUS:]
But tonight I wanna sing, I wanna dance under the moon
Yes tonight I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna dance
I'm gonna be happy

[JOAN SEBASTIAN:]
Hey you, don't pretend that you don't care
Yes you, you've been tripping here and there
And I've been used, been abused

[CHORUS:]
But tonight I wanna sing, I wanna dance, there's no excuse
Yes tonight I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna dance
I'm gonna be happy

Hey, hey, hey you

[REPEAT:]
Yeah you, you in the mirror in the wall
Yes you, will you listen after all?
I've been hurt, see my wound

[CHORUS:]
But tonight I wanna sing, I wanna dance under the moon
Yes tonight I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna dance
I'm gonna be happy
