If what I am is what's in me
Then I'll stay strong - that's who I'll be
And I will always be the best 
"me" that I can be.

There's only one me, I am it
Have a dream I'll follow it
It's up to me to try.

Oh! I'm a keep my head up high
Keep on reaching high
Never gonna quit
I'll be getting stronger.

And nothing's gonna bring me down (no!)
Never gonna stop, gotta go.
Because I know
I'll keep getting stronger.

And what I am is thoughtful
What I am is musical
What I am is smart
And what I am is brave
What I am is helpful
What I am is special
There's nothing I can't achieve.
Because in myself I believe in oh...

Gonna keep our heads up high

Keep on reaching high
Never gonna quit
Just keep getting stronger.

And nothing's gonna bring us down (no!)
Never give it up, gotta go.
Because I know
I'll keep getting stronger.

What I am is super
What I am is proud
What I am is friendly
What I am is grouchy
What you are is magical
What you are is special

There's nothing I can't achieve.
Because in myself I believe in oh...

Gonna hold my head up high
Keep on reaching high
Never gonna stop
I'll be getting stronger.

Nothing's gonna bring me down (no!)
Never give it up gotta go, oh... yeah...
I'll keep getting strong-er.
