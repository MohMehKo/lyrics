1, 2, 3, 4...

Hey wonderful...nice to meet U...(sugar)...
U know...that U're a beautiful creature...
So fine and sophisticated...
I'm so glad that we ain't related...
[?]
And tell U things that others don't (that's right)...
[?]
On and on and on and on...
Oh oh oh...

D cup size 25 waist...(alright)...
Ooh...what a lovely face...
Your hips and candy things...
Girl they got Me mesmerized (that's right girl)...
I just wanna lay U down (that's right girl)...
And make them pleasant sound...
I can't think of nobody else...
That goes better with Myself...

Oh... Ooh...

[Chorus:]
We look good together...
I know...
Why would she go looking for a new Love...
Tomorrow...
Why don't U...
Tell Me when U need it again (alright)
Tell Me when U need it again (alright)
Tell Me when U need it again (alright)
Tell Me when U need it again

Tell Me when U want Me to Love U...
[?]
But if U're far away from home...
U could call me on My cell phone...(that's right)...
Yeah...and I could talk U through it...
Yeah...girl...U know how we do it...
So just close your eyes...
We can fantasize...

Think about lingerie that I bought U...
Think about Me...taking them off U...
[?]
I just wanna get lost in U...(that's right)...
[?]
I tell you things that brothers don't (that's right)...
I don't think 'bout nobody else...
Just Me with your self...

[Chorus:]
We look good together...
I know...
Why would she go looking for a new Love...
Tomorrow...
Why don't U...
Tell Me when U need it again (alright)
Tell Me when U need it again (alright)
Tell Me when U need it again (alright)
Tell Me when U need it again
