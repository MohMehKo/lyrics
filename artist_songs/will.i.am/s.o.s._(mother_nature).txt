[Intro:]
Lord come down and help us out
Send us an angel, help us out
SOS, help us out
Looking all around and I'm watching the world

[Verse 1:]
People killing, people dying, people lying, people blind
People don't see the sign, watching money all the time
Get the pennies, get the dimes, get the dollars is the mindstate
Of the human race, people on the paper chase
The environment is fragile, and we been on the gradual
Declining in a lifetime or lose the battle
Get burned by volcanoes, get blown by tornadoes
Cause mother nature signals, is trying to warn NATO
We got a new terror threat, it's called the weather
More deadlier than chemical and nuclear together
It's hotter in the winter, even hotter in the summer
Jesus, or Buddha, somebody come and help us out

[Chorus 1:]
Lord come down and help us out
Send us an angel, help us out
SOS, help us out
Looking all around and I'm watching the world, changing
Open up your eyes, you can see things rearranging
The world is dying
And if they say it's gonna be alright, them people are lying

[Verse 2:]
People trapped behind the gates, ignorance in their state of mind
Cause they formulate a plan just to penetrate us
You see they stimulate us with fear, manipulate us
Each year, they dominate dividing us like calculators
And we can't add it up cause calculators do the math for us
And here they come choppering down, chopping down our rainforest
F**king up our air for us, they don't really care for us
But we can't complain, because the only one to blame is us
The gas is rising up but we keep on filling up
CO2 levels got the whole planet heated up
It's blazing in the winter, even hotter in the summer
Mohammed, Jehovah, somebody come and help us out

[Chorus 2:]
Lord come down and help us out
Send us an angel, help us out
SOS, help us out
Looks like we ain't gon' figure it out
Lord come down and help us out
Send us an angel, help us out
SOS, help us out
Looking all around and I'm watching the world, changing
Open up your eyes, you can see things rearranging
The world is ending
And if they say it's gonna be okay, they just pretending

[Verse 2:]
When the eskimo gets bit by a mosquito
Somebody in Miami will get swept by a tsunami
Rastas in Jamaica will get hit by a quake that
Registers something like 8.8
You see it's situations happening with our planet
Cause, 50 years ago we took it for granted
We should have took advantage, and reversed the damage
Instead of just pumping and selling and slanging the gas
And while we purchased the gas
We was watching soap operas while they steady brainwashed the masses
Cause we could make a vehicle that runs off ashes
But they own a patent for that, and that's exactly what's happening
Corruption and bullshit politics
The planet's gonna die cause of bullshit politics
It's hotter in the winter, even hotter in the summer
And ain't nobody coming to the rescue to help the
