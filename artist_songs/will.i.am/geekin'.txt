[Chorus:]
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek on,
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek on,
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek on,
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek

Here we go, here we, here we go,
Here we go, here we, here we go,
Here we go, here we, here we go,
Here we go, here we, here we go.

[Verse 1:]
Hey, I'm on that geek, geek,
Freaking technology technique.
Yeah, I flow tight, never leak,
I'm the future with a bunch of antique.
I make Google money, that's a lot of clicks,
So tell me who the dummy and who the genie is?
Yeah, that's why you buy it, use it, use it at it,
I thought it up and you bought it,
I bought cause I'm technologic.
Oh, yep, I might it have called,
He wasn't one but he wasn't old,
Oze, triple ones, he was an oz,
Oz, yo, I'm ice cold.
I am too cool, I am new school,
I am plus pic, let me take a flick booth,
Hey y'all, I'm the fucking nerd,
I'm about to ball real big, Mark Zuckerberg.
You know the nerd is a perp, what you heard?
Ain't need to follow, but lead up, tweety bird.

[Chorus:]
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek on,
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek on,
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek on,
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek

Here we go, here we, here we go,
Here we go, here we, here we go,
Here we go, here we, here we go,
Here we go, here we, here we go.

[Verse 2:]
Hey, I roll with gangsta geeks,
We're white cold like Dr Dre been making Beats.
He made it out that got billion uses in a week,
We bought a boat, four hundred eighty feet.
I'm so dope, baby, I'm a shit geek,
But ladies know, that's why they send me tweet tweets,
I let them know that I be on my B.I.Z.'
Pimping technology, that's what I be
Floften, willy on the cover of Fortune,
Fived up below, sending flows to martians.
Gold digger pros got me taking precaution,
Cause they just want my dope #extortion.
But I don't go for that, y'all know my style,
I rode it out for that, call tricky out.
I'm so pay, my friends call me pay pal
I make a lot of chips, now they call me Intel.

[Chorus:]
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek on,
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek on,
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek on,
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek

Here we go, here we, here we go,
Here we go, here we, here we go,
Here we go, here we, here we go,
Here we go, here we, here we go.

[Verse 3:]
I had a dream and then the dream came true,
I bought a boat and I bought a private plane too
I bought a space ship to go to outer space too
And all I had to do is get the ace in the stool.
Check me out, I'm a, I'm an engineer,
A mathematician, technician and a visioneer.
A scientist, the motherfucking nerd,
The rebirth, the clue, fuck what you heard.
