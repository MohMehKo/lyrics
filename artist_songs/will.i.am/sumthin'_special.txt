[Intro: will.i.am (Dante)]
You're sumthin' special baby (you're sumthin' special) 
You're my special lady (you're very special) 
You're so incredible baby (you're so incredible) 
You're sumthin' special 

[Dante Santiago]
Your eyes, your vibe, they hypnotize me 
From the second I saw you girl, I couldn't deny it 
How you talk, your walk, your style is gracious 
Havin dreams of takin you off to some tropical places 
Exotic, erotic, just filled with passion 
In bed is the only time that we would be clashin 
You're honest, loyal, a heaven-sent blessing 
Not tryna run you drag, I just had to confess it 
Your scent, your lips, I love when you smile 
I want to be chillin witchu for more than a while 
For days, months, years, and lifetime 
You're so incredible, it's so special you're mine 
Your mind, body, and soul is addictive 
I can't complain cause you're the type I'd LOVE to have kids with 
How you move and dance, when you're feelin the groove 
And when we dim the lights you do that thing that you do 

[Pre-Chorus: Niu]
You're the type of girl that I just wanna be down 
And baby girl I'm lettin you know I'm feelin' yo' style 
And if you feel the same way, then tell me now 
And girl don't waste no time so we can do it, do it 

[Chorus: will.i.am]
You're sumthin' special baby 
You're my special lady 
You're so incredible baby 
You're sumthin' special 
You're sumthin' special baby 
You're my special lady 
You're so incredible baby 
You're sumthin' special 

[Dante Santiago]
You're one in a million, you and I should be building 
our sand castles of love to the stars above 
And fill it up with our children, spend eternity chillin 
On deserted island, slow tunes and violins 
I wanna show you just how anxious I've been 
To tell the whole world, to HELL with my friends 
It's me and you girl, until the whole world ends 
I'ma stand by you as you stand by your man 
Cause when we together, I'm feelin nothin' but pleasure 
Most of these couples now don't have what we treasure 
You're my earth, my moon, the wind, and the sky 
The apple of my eye, you're my natural high 
Your hair, your hips, your creamy-ass thighs 
I pray to God that you don't end up passin me by 
Are you down, with me even through the hard times? 
Let's make this happen girl, you're a one of a kind 

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Taboo]
Looka here, baby girl, you are my world 
When I see you walk by, my head'll surely swirl
Over to the right side, who made that eye connection?
Satisfying thought when nastiness upon my section 
Checkin out my eyes just to see if I'm a (real man)
No need for you to worry, I'ma give you sexual (healing) 
You need some understanding, I need some understanding 
Together as a team if we are locos puffin [?]
Style and finesse 'em, boots match your dressing 
You are made for me, there's no doubt, no question 
Damn it feels good to see baby up on it 
It's a special love and I gave you what you wanted like..

[Pre-Chorus]
