Watching the world
Watching them all go insabe
Look at them all
Looking them do evil things

So I go out and dance
Party-ing my problems away
Look at me now
Look at me dancing again
In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters

Drop the beat. In a club.

I rock club, like karma out there
Night shot 'til daylight
Hot models my type
Let's go, take flight
Explode dynamite
Disco black light
In a club.

Party people rocking hardcore in a club
DJ rock the fucking dance floor in a club
Hot mamas dancing, oh lord, in a club
I just came to rock on out, to escape from the world

Watching the world
Watching them all go insane
Look at them all
Looking them do evil things

So I go out and dance
Party-ing my problems away
Look at me now
Look at me dancing again
In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters

Drop the beat. In a club.

Feeling like a star when I walk in the house
DJ spin that record and he burned down the house
Just MC hammer I'm a turn the motha' out
I'm a rock the dance floor, check me out
I am with all my people, we gon' fuck up the place
I was stressed out, so I had to get away
The world is going mad, I think they gone crazy
So I just gotta break on out

In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters

Drop the beat...
