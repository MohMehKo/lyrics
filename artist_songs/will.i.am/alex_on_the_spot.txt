I've been around the world in the pourin' rain
Feelin' out of place, I'm feelin' strange
Take me to a place where they know my name
Where everyone knows my name

Check it check it out I'm about to do my thing
King of the floor King of the swing
Play a little beat, I'll be your dancin' machine
Play a little jam, I'll come alive, alive, alive

(...They got jungle fever, show 'em some love, some love...)

This is my home, This is my home
King of the throne
This is my home
This is my home
This is my home
This is my home

See I've been travelin'
'Been travelin' forever
But now that I'm finally home, feels like I'm in heaven 
See I've been travelin'
'Been travelin' forever
But now that I'm home, it's like I'm in heaven

Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah, I'mma work it, work it out, I'm, (Hey Ya, Hey Ya)
I'm, (Check It, Check It out) I'm okay now, (Hey Ya, Hey Ya) I'm...
