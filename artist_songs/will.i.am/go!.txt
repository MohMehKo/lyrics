Check this out,
I'm making money, 
Rocking rhymes,
Dating honeys.
Doing shows around the globe,
Limousines on the road.
Throwing rhymes up in the air,
So they call me Willionaire.
I like chicks in fancy fits,
And other fo cover dips.
Till the beat rockin kick,
Watch the ladies lick they lips.
While I'm rockin on the mic,
Like Jimmy Walker dynamite.
Because,

I like five-foot models,
Holding twelve-ounce bottles.
They're invited,and I'm excited
Just like I won the lotto.
Come and dance to my single,
After that we gone mingle.
Sweep you off you feet,
And play you beats to recite my jingle.
Zeema zeema zeem zeema,

Zooma zooma zoom yo,
Body, party down let's go.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
I don't really wanna go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
And leave the party while its happenin'.
Go head, get busy! Okay get busy!
Go head, get busy, start it!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
I don't really wanna go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

I handle mine,
Can't complain I'm doin fine.
God blessed me with these ryhmes,
So just let me blow your mind.
I'm a musician, lady's man.
Throwing roses to my fans,
Yeah, they supporting us they the years.
That's enough.
Come on, I give a shout-out to all of my crew,
Fergie-Ferg, apl.de.ap, and my homie Taboo.
Golden Vay, Ona True, 
Steven, Tommy, Polo True, 
Burning Star, Donny Noga, and that nigger Nyu.
Yeah, that just how we do,
Check it at Parta Village,
Yo we stay in California,
Makin beats that you all feelin.
