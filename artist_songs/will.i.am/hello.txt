I'm here with all of my peoples,
All of, all of my homies,
When I stepped in the place them ladies act like they know me.
Yeah, they on me, they on it,
I walked in with an army,
Made it rain in this motherfucker, now it's storming and storming.
Ring the booth, ring the booth, baby, turn up the tune,
I can't talk with the tune, give me room, give me room.
I got that thing with the banger, get the shit off her hanger,
Put your drinks in the air, turn around to a stranger and say

Bring them drink, bring them drink,

Put your drinks in the air, turn around to a stranger and say
