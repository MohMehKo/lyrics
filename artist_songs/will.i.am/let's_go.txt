[Chris Brown:]
All day, girl, I had you on my mind
And I'm thinking about maybe later
Me and you can spend some time

And you can spend my money
Me and you can feel alive
And let's forget about the world
Cause baby, this is you and I

[Hook:]
Let's get crazy, alright,
Come on, let's go.
Crazy, alright,
Come on, let's go.
Crazy, alright,
Come on, let's go.
Crazy, alright,
Come on, let's go,
Let's go, Let's go,
Let's...

Dancing on the dance floor,
Girl, is you I adore.
Step off stage, I scream for more,
My nated junk I love gold.
Snap my fingers, make you mine,
If not, I snap a second time,
After that I guarantee you will be standing next to me.
My baby, baby, baby,
You're sexy, drive me crazy,
I feel like I've been blazing,
Buffing purple hazing.
Well girl, this love is natural,
Forever unintouchable,
So, what you're waiting for, what you're waiting for,
What you're waiting for?

Let's go
What you're waiting for,
What you're waiting for, what you're waiting for?
Let's go
What you're waiting for,
What you're waiting for, what you're waiting for?
Let's go
What you're waiting for,
What you're waiting for, what you're waiting for?
What you're waiting for,
What you're waiting for, what you're waiting for?

Let's get crazy, alright,
Come on, let's go.
Crazy, alright,
Come on, let's go.
Crazy, alright,
Come on, let's go.
Crazy, alright,
Come on, let's go,
Let's go,
Let's go,
Let's...

Love you like my boom-box,
Make me wanna moon walk,
No, this ain't no old love,
Lamborghini coom touch.
Mrs Maseratti, hop inside my Bugatti,
Girl, I'm a make you mine,
Hot damn you're fine, I want your body.
I want, I want, I want you,
Love me, damn, why don't you?
Girl, this ain't no puppy love,
Grown man shit, no youngster.
I would love to touch you,
I ain't trying to rush you,
But what you're waiting for, what you're waiting for,
What you're waiting for?

Let's go
What you're waiting for,
What you're waiting for, what you're waiting for?
Let's go
What you're waiting for,
What you're waiting for, what you're waiting for?
Let's go
What you're waiting for,
What you're waiting for, what you're waiting for?
What you're waiting for,
What you're waiting for, what you're waiting for?

Let's get crazy,
Let's get crazy,
Let's get crazy,
Let's get crazy

Let's go,
Let's go,
Let's go.

All day, girl, I had you on my mind
And now I'm thinking about maybe later
Me and you can spend some time.
And you can help me spend my money,
Me and you could feel alive,
And let's forget about the world,
Cause baby, it's just you and I
