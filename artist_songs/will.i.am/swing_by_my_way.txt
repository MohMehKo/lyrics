Lady over by the bar
Lookin' like a movie star
I gotta know just who you are so tell me you name
I like the way you groove and glide
I like the way you slip and slide
Maybe later on tonight you'll come play with me

And ooooh, show me to another place
And ooooh, show me how your honey taste
And ooooh, tell me what it takes for you to
Swing by my way
Swing by my way

Maybe we should slow it down
Or maybe we should just head out
Or maybe I should kiss you now right here on the floor
'Cause baby when you move like that
You're givin' me a heart attack
But still you got me comin' back and beggin' for more

And ooooh, show me to another place

And ooooh, show me how your honey taste
And ooooh, tell me what it takes for you to
Swing by my way
Swing by my way

And, baby ooooweee
Watch yourself you might be comin' home with me
Grab your purse and baby let me grab my keys
Let's get up out this place and maybe
Swing by my way
Swing by my way

Lady over by the bar
Lookin' like a movie star
I gotta know just who you are so tell me you name
I like the way you groove and glide
I like the way you slip and slide
Maybe later on tonight you'll come play with me
