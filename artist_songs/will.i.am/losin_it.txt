[Will.I.am:]
I'm tryna to maintain with all of these games
Me and my ex be sexing but I ain't her mayne
You, you know the deal when the love is real
But it's complicated we hate each other and still

Mess around when we got problems
No we have to solve them all
Issues yeah we got 'em
But I still revolve around her
Man we do it
Yeah we acting foolish
But before we get into it
I say hold up wait a minute

[Fergie:]
No I can't wait no more
I gotta have you boy
Somebody call the doctor
Scream and holla
Until your lungs get sore
No I can't take it boy
I want you even more
Touch me, touch me

[Will.I.am:]
It's fucking up my flow
This time I do not know
If I should give it to her
Or should I go
Cause when it's up and time to go
She gets emotional
She's tearing and she's crying
For what I don't know
Oh yeah I know we got them problems
No, we haven't solved 'em all
Issues yeah we got them
Yep, they just revolve around us
And we do it
Yep yep we do it
But before we get into

Somebody call the doctor
Scream and holla
Until your lungs get sore

Touch me, touch me
