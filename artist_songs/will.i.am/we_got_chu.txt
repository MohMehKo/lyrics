[Intro: Planet Asia]
Something sorta special... powerful 

[will.i.am]
We got chu (got chu), we got chu (let's get the) 
We got chu (party), we got chu (started) 
Let's do this, let's do this 
Let's do this, get this started noooow 
(A one, two) 
Let's do this, let's do this 
Let's do this, get this started  

[Planet Asia]
Emcees just get your bars up, believe I spit the deadliest poems 
Steady in zoned, I cock back ready and stoned 
Slap box rap, heavy and armed, relax ock 
It's hardball on the blacktop, throwin them bows 
So lo and behold, the honorable As' rap 
Phenomenal competition, I flatten rappers out like ham bones 
Ya crew cut characters contain something other than first of all 
My hip-hop is straight from the gutter position we left 
Instantly anticity shows 
Officially spittin until I turn officially gold 
And it's the hunger that I be gettin me over 
Just when I expose the most outlandish to my folder
Book binder, somethin that I took some time on 
To cultivate the masses with these gold chain sciences 

[Flii]
It's Flii styles with the terrible parables 
Pillage a whole village with pistol-grip paragraphs'll stare at you 
Foolin with the vocal vigilante dog, please 
My style's master, your style's asthma, breathe 
Hardcore boy, I ain't givin up no dap
Head peasier than pubic naps wit stupid raps 
Who could rap? Bring that ass here to me 
Asia hangin them over the bridge like Nino from New Jack City 
Who's that, kiddies? Nice and pretty witty, they can't get wit' 'ii 
Titanium wrecking ball flows, slaughter my foes 
Case closed, mouth closed, I don't wanna hear no babble 
It sounds like a blisha-blasha-blah 
See they listen to us cause you were never enough 
And I'ma hit the people with the game on 'ii
If I don't represent the town, shame on me 

[Chorus: will.i.am]
We got chu (got chu), we got chu (got chu) 
We got chu (party), we got chu (started) 
Let's do this (do it), let's do this (do it)
Let's do this, get this started now 
Let's do it do it, let's do it do it 
Do it do it, do it, and do it do it 
Let's do this (do it), let's do this (do it)
Let's do this, get this started 
Let's do it do it, let's do it do it 
Do it do it, do it, and do it do it 

[Asia:] Hey, yo Flii, you the illest
[Flii:] Man Asia, you the realest 
[both:] Put us both together it's the ultimate 
We came to give the party people what they 'posed to get 
[Flii:] Live worldwide, why you makin local hits? 

[Asia]
On the block I still post with kids 
Have 'em on my street time 
On some gold chains, poster biz 

[Flii]
Wow, now that's real marketing 
Spark the meeting with the label to stablely enable hits 

[Asia]
Major events, daddy rich lay in the tent 
Playin the hit, relayin this for ladies and gents 

[Flii]
Relentless with this prolific, so we said what we meant 
We live what we did, we leave, it's weird, do it again 

[Asia (Flii)]
So next time come through with your mens (you and your kin) 
Slick with the mic, could have you slide through in the Benz

[Flii:] Slick with the talk and how you scoopin her and her friend 
[Asia:] Extermin these plans for currency insurance and gems 
[Flii:] Knowledge Wisdom, they got it with them, recitin the hymns
[Asia:] Enlighten the men, mic fight writin with them 

[Flii]
Tight with the pen, ballpoint the thoughts that we think 
You gotta feel it, it's sorta like we live in the ink, we got chu! 

[Chorus]

{ti od ti od dna, ti od, ti od ti oD
ti od ti od dna, ti od, ti od ti oD}
