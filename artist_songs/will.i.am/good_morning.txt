Good morning, welcome to the thing called light.
Good morning, don't you let it pass you by.
We laugh, we cry and then we dry our eyes,
We fall, we rise, ready for another try.

When life gets tough, remember we were never born to die,
When times get tough remember we were born to be alive.

Good morning, wake up and live the life,
And don't forget to dream the dreams, the dreams.
And don't forget to live the dreams and dream
And don't forget to dream the wonderful things.
