Let me tell you about my Girlfriend, 
My Girlfriend Mona Lisa,
She Let Somebody Take Her Picture,
So She Could Be a Fashionista

She says she wanna be a Model
But what she wanna be a Model for,
She told me that she wanna Travel
Walk the Room at the Milano

But I Tell her that I Loved Her, Adored Her, I Need Her, My Lisa
She told me Trust Her, I Won't, I Wanna Trust Her

And I Dunno why it Hurts Me Hurts Me Hurts Me
I get Jealous when she Working Working Working
All the Fellas they be Looking Looking Looking,
They Lookin at My Lisa Lisa Lisa

Let me tell you about my Baby, 
My Baby Mona Lisa, 
She told me that I'm Acting Crazy,
She said I Need to Free Her

She said she feel like she in Prison,
But why she feel like she in Prison,
We always go into the Oceanside, and the Mountain Top
We be Livin' the Good Livin'

She wanna be a Model,
And Travel, and walk in the Room with the Milano
She say I'm Jealous, I know I'm Jealous,
Because I Wanna have her for me and not the Fellas

And it Hurts Me Hurts Me Hurts Me,
All the Time She Be Working Working Working,
Them Boys be Flirtin' Flirtin',
They Flirtin' with my Lisa Lisa Lisa

Smile For Me Mona Lisa Lisa [x4]
