It's on a high stage, jealous for show,
... I'm the C.E.O!
The so control...
Get the beat so low, make the people say yow!
Aha! I know you're being jealous niggers!
I know!
I know you're being jealous niggers!
I know!

[Chorus:]
This hear is freshen than yours,
Yes Sir, is freshen than yours!
My clique is freshen than yours,
My chicks move sexy than yours!
My style is... than yours,
My flow, my... is shitting on yours!
And you can hate if you want it, it's alright,
I know that you're just jealous!
This beat is fresh!
This beat is fresh!

... stop with the flow,
Steady with the sound like my name is Daddy O
Cause niggers' talking shit like their mouths is...
But I rock the glow, making niggers say yow!
They don't know... our flow looking like yow!
They see me rocking tinny bottles, got me saying yow!
But now I'm only blocks, looking hot, like yow!
Go get the niggers, put us ready on a radio!
I'll pour our soul when no pop limo,
I'll whip... playing same gender, I'll do it in a studio
Do it like nobody do it, do it, do it...!
