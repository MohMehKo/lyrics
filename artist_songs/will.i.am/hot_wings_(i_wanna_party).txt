[Nico:] Party in Ipanema, baby!

[Nico:] I want to party
I want to samba
I want to party
I want to samba

I want to party
And live my life (Pedro: live my life)
I want to party (party)
And fly

Imma fly, fly just like a bird
(But you are a bird! )
Oh yeah, you're right,
So let me fly just like a rocket, then (ok)
Fly so high where I need to come down for oxygen
Cause once we start it, baby, ain't no ain't no stoppin' then

Cause I just want to live my life, and party
All I want is to be free, and rock my body
Ain't nowhere around the world that I want to live my life
In Rio
Cause in Rio
In Rio, I realize
I want to party (party)
I want to samba (party)
I want to party (party)
And fly

[Pedro:] I'm that samba, samba
Master, master, master
Master, master

Who shouts out?
Imma get your blaster, blaster,
Blaster, blaster, blaster
You dance fast,
But I dance faster, faster, faster
Faster, faster

You're too slow
You need to catch up

[Both:] You can dance, and dance, but I...

[Nico:] I want to party (party)
I want to samba (party)
I want to party (party)
I want to samba (party)

I want to party (party)
And live my life (live my life)
I want to party (party)
And fly
