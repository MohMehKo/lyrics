[Intro: will.i.am]
Uh. uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Wha, wha? Yo..
It's will.i.am on the beats
Bringin the hot heat, hot heat, hot heat...

[Chorus: Medusa (will.i.am)]
(Who the hell are you?) It's Medusa pushin through 
(Are you rollin with a crew?) Feline Science is my crew 
(Whatchu gon' spit?) Nothin but that hot shit 
(Who the hell are you?) Medusa pushin through 
(Are you rollin with a crew?) Feline Science is my crew 
(And whatchu gonna spit?) Nothin but that hot shit!

[Medusa]
Give me a bangin instrumental, and I'll kick mix 
like a flick off of a drummer's wrist drops the filla
Fo' realla, high-powered sister, trained by, madams, queens
Uncle Jam, mommy, parties musicians, and killers 
So there's no wonder they say I drop speech deep 
My pop block got heat 
I come with a Screamethian beat 
Screamethian? That means I have you screamin like a heathen 
Known a battle 'til I'm acheivin
Violatin your childish rhymes of the one 
My uncontrollable lyrics they, murder for fun 
And I thank God, I finally get to be on some, see? 
You gonna be leavin the stadium talkin 'bout, "Uh-HEH.. 
I tell ya, that kid's a true performer!" 
Givin you your money's worth, fanta tongue workin all that 
Lyrics been shadowboxin against the pads 
From WAY DOWN in the underground deep 
I'm the bad-ass lion that stepped in the signifyin monkey feet 
And if that line doesn't... what the FUCK? Wake him up! 
CLEAR! BZZZZT! Don't try to pass out now 
'Cause you see the wrath of the blast of the incomin styles 
Shrapnel and pronouns and verbs for miles 
Wait, let me set it 
I gotta take my time to give the other emcees credit 
I never underestimate my opponents flow 
They just get mesmerized by the Feline body blow 
Full force is the cuff, and no matter what your crew LICK SHOTS 
It'll never be enough 

[Chorus 2X]
