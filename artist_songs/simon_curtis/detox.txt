You're up against 
The people 
Trying to 
Take back 
Your music
Its like a reclamation 
You against the heat
You gotta get 
In the zone
You gotta 
Get in the zone 

Detoxify
Detoxify

Not that long ago 
I loved nobody more
To make you happy
Baby 
I thought you were born
I had to watch 
You play around 
With those boys
Anticipating 
When you make 
Some more noise

I felt so lucky 
To have you 
In my life
I looked the other way 
As you walked on by 
But everytime 
I see you
Now I deploy
Please Mona Lisa
Baby
Hit me one more time 

It just got so crazy
I thought 
You were stronger
Oh baby baby
Can't wait that much longer

Don't believe
I just don't believe it
Said you beat it
But I don't believe it 
So I think you need it
Don't think you need it
Don't repeat it
Detox

You need it
Don't deny it
You just don't deny it
Try to hide it
But you can't deny it
So I don't defy it
You can't justify it
Rigidify it
And detoxify it

You're up against the people 
Trying to take back your music
Its like a reclamation 
You against the heat
You gotta 
Get in the zone
You gotta 
Get in the zone

And if you really wanna fight it
Sattle up 
And let your rhythm renighted it
Try to hit it
In a minute I'mma take you on
I'mma take you on

Now I can see 
Your just a girl
You are not 
Don't let me be 
The last to know
When you thought 
'Bout where you're gonna go 
Before the goodbye 

I try and try
But I can't get satisfied
Sometimes I feel 
The answer
You give is poor
I'm about to tell you 
Don't go knockin' 
On my door 

It just got so crazy
I thought you were stronger
Oh baby baby
Can't wait that much longer

Don't believe
I just don't believe it
Said you beat it 
But I don't believe it 
So I think you need it
Don't think you need it
Don't repeat it
Detox 
You need it

Don't deny it
You just don't deny it
Try to hide it
But you can't deny it
So I don't defy it
You can't justify it
Rigidify it
And detoxify it

Don't believe
I just don't believe it
Said you beat it 
But I don't believe it 
So I think you need it
Don't think you need it
Don't repeat it
Detox 
You need it

Don't deny it
You just don't deny it
Try to hide it
But you can't deny it
So I don't defy it
You can't justify it
Rigidify it
And detoxify it

You're up against the people 
Trying to take 
Back your music
Its like a reclamation
You against the heat
You gotta 
Get in the zone
You gotta 
Get in the zone

And if you really wanna fight it
Sattle up 
And let your rhythm renighted it
Try to hit it
In a minute I'mma take you on
I'mma take you on
