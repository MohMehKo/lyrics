Come on baby listen there's some things you ought to know
I've looked up how this love plays out and where it's gonna go
Don't tell me that I'm different or that you could try to show me
Other ways to go about it
I already know
This is a relationship in which I make a sacrifice
You take the cut and split it up and leave the body paralyzed
Unable to break free of it till it's too late to realize
But that's just what you've gotta do
You take the ride
You pay the price

Hey
What do you want me to say?
Tell me
I already gave you everything you want
Now give me everything I need
I've got a soul for sale
A soul for sale
Oh
What do you want me to be?
Show me
Cause I wanna give you everything you want
Just give me everything I need
I've got a soul for sale
A soul for sale

For forty days and forty nights you worked it to seduce me
I'd listen to the lyrics of your song cause they amused me
The sing along did not last long
It started to reduce me to a puppet on the shelf just screaming
"Puppet master choose me!"
So come on baby
Come on love me like a Kamekazee
We'll go down in flames together
Light it up like paparazzi calling out my name
The fame
The flames
They're all one and the same
So sign me up to love you
Cause I'm ready for the game

Hey
What do you want me to say?
Tell me
I already gave you everything you want
Now give me everything I need
I've got a soul for sale
A soul for sale
Oh
What do you want me to be?
Show me
Cause I wanna give you everything you want
Just give me everything I need
I've got a soul for sale
A soul for sale

Oh!

Give me everything, give me everything 

Sign on the line
Make a deal with the Devil
Make a deal with the Devil in blood

Sign on the line
Make a deal with the Devil
Make a deal with the Devil in blood

But I want it all
