Here's to all the people who've been trying to keep me down 
Got their fingers in my collar trying to turn me all around 
I find it so funny to hear how much they hate 
Try to push me to the ground then say they love me to my face 
Say what you mean and don't try to deceive me 
I so want to believe it, yes I want to, yes I do 
Say what you want and don't try to prolong it 
If you want to so-long it, then I want you to, yes I do 

I'm feeling all the heat, they're gonna hear my call 
Now I can wait to see you lose it all 
You've placed your bets and he is gonna make you fall 
I can't believe you're so delusional 

Now I know you're gonna try to say I stole this verse from Tim', 
but there's a firestarter out there and I'm sure he stole from him 
first 
Don't say you love me then turn around and drop me 
cause soon you're gonna want me and you know it's true, yes you do 
Why don't you see him the way he really is? 
cause soon you'll wanna leave him and I know it's true, yes I do 

I'm feeling all the heat, they're gonna hear my call 
Now I can wait to see you lose it all 
You've placed your bets and he is gonna make you fall 
I can't believe you're so delusional
