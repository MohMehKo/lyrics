There once was a boy
Who was made, not created
He wanted to learn
He wanted to indulge his senses
To understand pain
But most of all
He wanted to love
For only when he found true love
Would he become real

He traveled far and long
But love eluded him
The humans that surrounded him
Complicated the word
Strove to drive it out of the world altogether
And this he could not understand
For what could be more simple
Than to love and be loved in return?

He was made
With an 8-Bit Heart...
