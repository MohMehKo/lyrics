Told you sometimes I see things that others won't believe
Fold em' let em' hit me raise it
Baby can't you see?
That all of it's illusion
The conclusion soon will be
So let out your inner animals and celebrate with me

I wanna put two horns on my head
Gonna dance till my eyes go black
I wanna put two horns on my head
Gonna dance till my eyes go black
I'm gonna fight
Gonna give it my all
Gonna give it till I can't go back
I'm gonna put two horns on my head
Gonna dance till my eyes go black

Will you take me
Out into the light where I can finally see?
Shine your light with me and chase all the dark away
Shine your light with me and chase all the dark away

So this is how you make yourself into what you wanna be
Keep your hands unfolded
Dawn is Golden
Take it by the lead
You're a cut above the masses
You're a king
You must believe
So shine a light into the dark
And then you'll finally see

I wanna put two horns on my head
Gonna dance till my eyes go black
I wanna put two horns on my head
Gonna dance till my eyes go black
I'm gonna fight
Gonna give it my all
Gonna give it till I can't go back
I'm gonna put two horns on my head
Gonna dance till my eyes go black

Will you take me
Out into the light where I can finally see?
Shine your light with me and chase all the dark away
Shine your light with me and chase all the dark away

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting?
What are - what are - what are you waiting for?

That all of it's illusion all-all-all of this illusion
So let out your inner animals and celebrate with me

Will you take me
Out into the light where I can finally see?
Shine your light with me and chase all the dark away
Shine your light with me and chase all the dark away
Shine your light with me and chase all the dark away
