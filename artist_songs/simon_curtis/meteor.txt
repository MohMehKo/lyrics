Burning up the sky so bright like a meteor

You and I were meant to fly
Singing la la la woaah
You and I, we can touch the sky
Singing la la la woaah

Life life
This is our life
Only going to get one night
So baby let's party

Dance dance this is our chance
If you want a little romance
Baby then watch me (watch me)

You and I were meant to fly
Singing la la la la woaah
You and I, we can touch the sky
Singing la la la la woaah
[x2]

Like a meteor, like a meteor
Burning up the sky and the night like a meteor
Like a meteor, like a meteor
Burning up the sky so bright like a meteor

Turn it up cause the music got the power to make us burn
Up up up
Like a meteor shower
Our heat from the beat gonna make the party people
get up out their seats

Life life
This is our life
Only going to get one night
So baby let's party (party)

Dance dance this is our chance
If you want a little romance
Baby then watch me (watch me)

You and I were meant to fly
Singing la la la la woaah
You and I, we can touch the sky
Singing la la la la woaah
[x2]

Like a meteor, like a meteor
Burning up the sky and the night like a meteor
Like a meteor, like a meteor
Burning up the sky so high like a meteor

You and I were meant to fly
Singing la la la la woaah
You and I, we can touch the sky
Singing la la la la woaah
[x2]

Like a meteor, like a meteor
Burning up the sky and the night like a meteor
Like a meteor, like a meteor
Burning up the sky so bright like a meteor
