Arriving just in time.
Who's dying to be mine?
Let me survey the scene
Good fight, now keep it clean!
How will this evening go?
Two lips to crack the code
Then now above them all
I hear the silence call:

It's a melodic, erotic, hypnotic kind of dance
The way the music controls you and the touch of your hand
Mesmerized by your eyes and the way you move
We can dance all night to this hypnotic groove

So soon she caught my eye
Now lingers up your thighs
To you I gravitate
Can't help but to delay
Keep moving if you dare
Surviving, almost there
That cool that's on your lips
I'll break it with my hips

It's a melodic, erotic, hypnotic kind of dance
The way the music controls you and the touch of your hand
Mesmerized by your eyes and the way you move
We can dance all night to this hypnotic groove
It's your melodic, erotic, hypnotic hold on me.
Captivated by your sexuality
Yeah, don't back up now, feel the rhythm of two
We can go all night to this hypnotic groove

Entranced now by your eyes
You've got me hypnotized
Hypnotized [4x]

It's a melodic, erotic, hypnotic kind of dance
The way the music controls you and the touch of your hand
Mesmerized by your eyes and the way you move
We can dance all night to this hypnotic groove

Melodic, erotic, hypnotic hold on me.
Captivated by your sexuality
Yeah, don't back up now, feel the rhythm of two
We can go all night to this hypnotic groove
It's a melodic, erotic, hypnotic kind of dance
The way the music controls you and the touch of your hand
Mesmerized by your eyes and the way you move
We can dance all night to this hypnotic groove
It's your melodic, erotic, hypnotic hold on me.
Captivated by your sexuality
Yeah, don't back up now, feel the rhythm of two
We can go all night to this hypnotic groove

Entranced now by your eyes
You've got me hypnotized
Hypnotized [4x]
