Friday night, we've been seen each other for
Little bit, little little bit bit
It's alright going just like every other time
But I need a hit, need a need a hit hit
Oh, I keep telling myself to hold back
Oh, get it? You gotta find another way

Oh boy, want you on the attack
What are you holding back? Why are you holding back?
This time I'm gonna need you
Just step up to the play
This time I'm gonna make you
'Cause I don't wanna wait

Tough love
Come on, give it to me rough
Take it down, throw me down
Make me stand up
Up, down, up, down
Baby, it's not enough
Imma teach ya lesson how to give me tough love
Tough love
Come on, make my body shake
Bringing up the rhythm
Like I'm in an earthquake
Up, down, up, down
Baby, it's not enough
Imma teach ya lesson how to give me tough love

So here we are, I've got you in my house
Take a seat, baby take a seat seat
Here's a blindfold, 'bout to show you how
Tie it over me, tie it over me me
Good, you learned it pretty quickly
I knew you would, baby now you take the lead
Oh, I think you better frisk me
Here's the handcuffs, you can throw away the key

Tough love
Come on, give it to me rough
Take it down, throw me down
Make me stand up
Up, down, up, down
Baby, it's not enough
Imma teach ya lesson how to give me tough love
Tough love
Come on, make my body shake
Bringing up the rhythm
Like I'm in an earthquake
Up, down, up, down
Baby, it's not enough
Imma teach ya lesson how to give me tough love

Baby, a thing about it
That I hope you understand
Is that if you don't satisfy my thing
Then I'll find someone who can
I know that you're my lover
Don't be afraid to hurt
Cause I'm a big girl
Now give me what I deserve

Tough love
Come on, give it to me rough
Take it down, throw me down
Make me stand up
Up, down, up, down
Baby, it's not enough
Imma teach ya lesson how to give me tough love

Tough love
Come on, make my body shake
Bringing up the rhythm
Like I'm in an earthquake
Up, down, up, down
Baby, it's not enough
Imma teach ya lesson how to give me tough love
