Like a wave in the water
In the ocean all alone
I'll wait, pull me under
Feel the tide ebb and flow in my bones

I've never been so high not without you
I feel stupid
You're going up this time, all night
It's what I need

Oh, satellite
Shoot you up into my orbit
Baby, never leave

In the corner of a galaxy
So far, far, far away
I will keep you always next to me, eh
Like the moon goes around the Earth,
You'll stay.

I've never been so high not without you
I feel stupid
You're going up this time, all night
It's what I need

Oh, satellite
Shoot you up into my orbit
Baby, never leave
