Do you remember the first time that you looked up into the night sky with me?
I knew forever I found that with you
When you're not around, all of my stars fall down

Back to when you wanted me
Back to when you needed me
Starlight, starlight, starlight, starlight
Back when all the stars were like diamonds shining in your eyes
Starlight, starlight, starlight, starlight

Time that I took for granted
I would move the sun and the planet if I could get you back in my orbit with me
And if you'd come back down, I would move them all around

And you left me in the dark
And you took my only spark

Back to when you wanted me
Back to when you needed me
Starlight, starlight, starlight, starlight
Back when all the stars were like diamonds shining in your eyes
Starlight, starlight, starlight, starlight

I wish, I may, I wish, I might
wish on the star I see tonight
I want you
I need you

Back to when you wanted me
Back to when you needed me
Starlight, starlight, starlight, starlight
Back when all the stars were like diamonds shining in your eyes
Starlight, starlight, starlight, starlight

And you left me in the dark
And you took my only spark

Back to when you wanted me
Back to when you needed me
Starlight, starlight, starlight, starlight
Back when all the stars were like diamonds shining in your eyes
Starlight, starlight, starlight, starlight

Diamonds shining in your eyes
When you're not around, all of my stars fall down
