Goin' out to get my mind on how you did me wrong
Told the DJ all about it, fucker better play my song
Look over to the doorway and much to my surprise
I see the devil grinnin' lookin' right into my eyes

Yeah, you want me
I can tell you do
I fell your eyes all over me
A-across the room
Oh, come get it, babe
I'll tell you no lie
I do like getting gay and say
I'm fucking you tonight

You will never break my heart in two
Used to crumble, baby, now I'm through
This time I'm feelin' so new
You, you, you won't break my heart in two

You will never break my heart in two
Used to crumble, baby, now I'm through
This time I'm feelin' so new
You, you, you won't break my heart in two

Here's a little secret that I don't mind if you share
I never really loved you and I never really cared
But you're lookin' so delicious that I'm ready to release
Call me Kit then you'll be Kat, now come on, break me off a piece

Yeah, you want me
I can tell you do
I fell your hands up on me
Before we make it to your room
Oh, come get me, babe
I'll tell you no lie
It's gonna be amazing
If you seek Amy tonight

You will never break my heart in two
Used to crumble, baby, now I'm through
This time I'm feelin' so new
You, you, you won't break my heart in two

You will never break my heart in two
Used to crumble, baby, now I'm through
This time I'm feelin' so new
You, you, you won't break my heart in two

(Break, break, break my heart)
