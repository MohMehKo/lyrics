Eighteen years
Faced all of our fears
We took on the world together
I caught all of your tears
You told me back then
That our love would never end
You lied
Hold me
Like you did before
Console me
Like we never went to war
You've thrown me
And my heart onto the floor
I died

(Now you're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me
(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me

(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me
(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me

Look at how you've turned
Yeah, you watched me burn
Just threw me in the fire
And you weren't concerned
You told me it was love
I would always be enough
You lied
Maybe
One day you'll come around
But baby
I'll be nowhere to be found
Betrayed me
Now baby in my eyes
You've died

Dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me
(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me

(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me
(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me

(Now you're)

(Dead to me, dead to me, dead to me)

Dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me
(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me

(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me
(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me

(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me
(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me

(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me
(You're) dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, you're dead to me

You're dead to me
