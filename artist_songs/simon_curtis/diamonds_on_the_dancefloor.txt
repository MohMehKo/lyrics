Hey, you see me
I know you want me
I'ma feed your appetite
It might, be serendipity
That I'm here with you tonight

Ooh baby, do you wanna let go?
We could fly away in the dark
Ooh baby, on your ready, set go
Feelin' it's about to start

All the time
It's like diamonds on the dance floor invading my mind
All the time
It's like an explosion burning inside

All the lights begin to roll
You don't wanna make me go (la lalala lalala lalalalalala)
I might lose my self control
You don't wanna let me go (la lalala lalala la la la)

I, know I, might not seem like the type
But looks can lead you on
So lead on
Baby I'll follow you
We've got from dusk to dawn

Ooh baby, do you wanna let go?
We could fly away in the dark
Ooh baby, on your ready set go
Feelin' it's about to start

All the time
It's like diamonds on the dance floor invading my mind
All the time
It's like an explosion burning inside

All the lights begin to roll
You don't wanna make me go (la lalala lalala lalalalalala)
I might lose my self control
You don't wanna let me go (la lalala lalala la la la)

All the time
It's like diamonds on the dance floor invading my mind
All the time
It's like an explosion burning inside

All the lights begin to roll
You don't wanna make me go (la lalala lalala lalalalalala)
I might lose my self control
You don't wanna let me go (la lalala lalala la la la)
