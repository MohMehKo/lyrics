I felt this time that we had something
You rolled your eyes like it was nothing new
You only think about you
Put your shades on not to show it
Don't pretend that you don't know its true
You only think about

If you look good
And girl you should

Welcome to hollywood
Boy, ya better live it up before it brings you down
Welcome to hollywood
Just got a grip on how to get around

I'm so glad I got to you know now you
I know what I'm suppose do
You only think about you
The freindly faces I've been seeing
Now I know they're far from being true
You only think about you
If you look good
I guess I should

Welcome to hollywood
Boy, ya better live it up before it brings you down
Welcome to hollywood
Just got a grip on how to get around

In your favorite tinseltown the boulevards,
The neon lights I've been in love since the first sight
I wouldn't change it if I could
Welcome to hollywood
Boy, ya better live it up before it brings you down
Welcome to hollywood
Just got a grip on how to get around, get around

Welcome to hollywood
Just got a grip on how to get around
Dog eat dog is to be seen in the tabloid magazine
Seventeen a billioniare daddy's money,
Do you care welcome to hollywood?
