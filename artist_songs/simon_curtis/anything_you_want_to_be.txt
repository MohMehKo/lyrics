Ohhhhhh
Yea

I'm here for you to see it through
And I dont wanna ever hold you down
You feel your high low goodbye
Someday the story's gunna turn around

Say say say 
What you want to
Do do do
What your feeling
I I I 
Stand right here beside you

It's a little bit hot
It's a little unique
Anything but ordinary
A little bit to me
Get under my skin
Then your there and everywhere
You can drive my car
You can be a star
You dont have to try so hard
You can only define in between the lines
With me
Your anything you wanna be

Your anything you wanna be
Come on lets go lets find a place
Lets hear our song play on the radio
Lets sing all day and dance all night
And nobody has to know

Say say say 
What you want to
Do do do
What your feeling
I I I 
Stand right here beside you

It's a little bit hot
It's a little unique
Anything but ordinary
A little bit to me
Get under my skin
Then your there and everywhere
You can drive my car
You can be a star
You dont have to try so hard
You can only define in between the lines
With me
Your anything you wanna be

Your anything you wanna be
Drive my car you can be a star
You dont have to try so hard
You can only define in between the lines
With me
Your anything you wanna be

Say say say 
What you want to
Do do do
What your feeling
I I I 
Stand right here beside you

It's a little bit hot
It's a little unique
Anything but ordinary
A little bit to me
Get under my skin
Then your there and everywhere
You can drive my car
You can be a star
You dont have to try so hard
You can only define in between the lines
With me
Your anything you wanna be

Your anything you wanna be
Anything you wanna be
Your anything you wanna be
