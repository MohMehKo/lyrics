How can I ever make you see, whats said I do to you, you do to me, but.. nobody seems to see a problem 
am I the only one who isn't like them
judge me, because I am not like you 
isn't that the thing were not supposed to do. 

[Pre-Chorus:]
Bring me fame, 
but you will soon disprove me.
seize the hate... you haven't, cannot see

[Chorus:]
You look at me and see a little sugar sugar white 
is that enough to say that she ain't your fucking appitite 
is that so wrong to show a little reposity 
Cause I want to treat you mother fuckers how your treating me 
Don't point a finger, because your just a fucking hypocrite 
you've played the cards so long and now I've had enough of it. 

Matter of fact
retract to my pact 
to hatch my flat back
Can't let you attack me 

Am I the reason you ashame me 
is that for all the wrong you blame me 
I'm never ever condecended 
now come on, brother we got to end it 

[Pre-Chorus:]
Bring me fame, 
but you will soon disprove me.
seize the hate... you haven't, cannot see

[Chorus:]
You look at me and see a little sugar sugar white 
is that enough to say that she ain't your fucking appitite 
is that so wrong to show a little reposity 
Cause I want to treat you mother fuckers how your treating me 
Don't point a finger, because your just a fucking hypocrite 
you've played the cards so long and now I've had enough of it. 

Matter of fact
retract to my pact 
to hatch my flat back
Can't let you attack me 

ahhhhhhhhh.....

I only speak the truth [x8]

[Chorus:]
You look at me and see a little sugar sugar white 
is that enough to say that she ain't your fucking appitite 
is that so wrong to show a little reposity 
Cause I want to treat you mother fuckers how your treating me 
Don't point a finger, because your just a fucking hypocrite 
you've played the cards so long and now I've had enough of it. 

Matter of fact
retract to my pact 
to hatch my flat back
Can't let you attack me
