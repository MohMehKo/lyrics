No-no-no-tice me

Notice me
Won't you notice me?
Go with me 
Won't you go with me? 
Follow me
Won't you follow me 
Come with me 
Won't you come with me?

Notice me

Go with me

Follow me
Won't you follow me?
Come with me
Won't you come with me?

Like a feather falling through the light
I'm drifting into madness
And all that felt so pure tonight 
Is shifting into sadness 

Like a feather falling through the light
I'm drifting into madness
And all that felt so pure tonight 
Is shifting into sadness 

How long do I have to dance?
(How long do I have to dance)
How long do I have to dance?
(How long do I have to dance?)

Like a feather falling through the light
I'm drifting into madness
And all that felt so pure tonight 
Is shifting into sadness 

D-d-do I have to dance?
(Notice me)
(No-no-tice me)
(Come with me)
Won't you come with me?
Follow me
Won't you follow me?
Come with me
Won't you come with me?

Notice me
Won't you notice me?
Go with me
Won't you go with me?
Follow me
Won't you follow me?
Come with me?
Won't you come with me?

Notice me
Notice me
No-no-no-tice me
