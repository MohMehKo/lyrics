Let's go feel the music
I'm heading to the floor
I'm climbing straight to the top
I'll keep you wanting more
You'll have to beg me to stop
There's not a question of if I'm the king of my crop
Cause I'm the thing that pulls the string oh don't you know

Let's go everybody circle around
Turn it up a little louder
Let's go everybody rockin' it now
Wanna hear you scream and shout it
Let's go feel the music
Let's go feel the music
Let's go feel the music
Make the party sing
Let's go feel the music
Let's go feel the music
Let's go feel the music
Make the party sing

We're gunna show you now what we've been talkin' about
Came here to shut it down
Without a care in the world
Wont need the mission fall
We'll bring to the show
You know that we gun claim it never shame it
Takin' control

Let's go everybody circle around
Turn it up a little louder
Let's go everybody rockin' it now
Wanna hear you scream and shout it
Let's go feel the music
Let's go feel the music
Let's go feel the music
Make the party sing
Let's go feel the music
Let's go feel the music
Let's go feel the music
Make the party sing

Let's go everybody circle around
Turn it up and feel the music
Let's go everybody rockin' it now
