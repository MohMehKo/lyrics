Let the beat drop

Time to round them up
And tell them where we're gonna go
If they don't know how to work it
Then I'll leave them at the door
Gotta make it to the center of the circle, grab my hand
Tell the DJ drop the beat
Don't play some motherfuckin' band

Let it in your body
And the party won't stop
'Cause it's seven kinds of naughty
When you let the beat drop
I told it to you once
I said why don't you understand?
Tell the DJ drop the beat
Don't play some motherfuckin' band

So give it to me baby
Tell me, what's it gonna be?
Gonna give it to me dirty
Out where everybody sees
'Cause I can't do nothing with you
If you're never gonna dance
So you better find some rhythm
'Cause they're playing Bad Romance
(Want your Bad Romance)

Let it in your body
And the party won't stop
'Cause it's seven kinds of naughty
When you let the beat drop
I told it to you twice
I said why don't you understand?
Tell the DJ drop the beat
Don't play some motherfuckin' band

Let it in your body
And the party won't stop
'Cause it's seven kinds of naughty
When you let the beat drop
I told you three times
I said why don't you understand?
Tell the DJ drop the beat
Don't play some motherfuckin' band

Let it in your body
And the party won't stop
'Cause it's seven kinds of naughty
When you let the beat drop
I told you four times
I said why don't you understand?
Tell the DJ drop the beat
Don't play some motherfuckin' band

Let it in your body
And the party won't stop
Seven kinds of naughty
When you let the beat drop
I've said it five times
Said why don't you understand?
Tell the DJ drop the beat
Don't play some motherfuckin' band
