Another night, another song, another chance not a
Girl to play so I lose em' in the dance, but I
Kinda like it so I'll give another chance
Baby here I go again
Feeling right, feeling strong, feeling independent
It comes along and its gone, but I keep pretending
That I'm cool, what to do, cause I can't give in
I must resist you now

I will resist you, so don't even try
I need to fight it but it feels so right
You won't resist me, now don't deny
I try to hide it but it feels so good inside

I don't know, gotta go, getting scared that I
Might give in and lose the game of truth or dare, but I
Know the truth already, do you really care?
Baby I don't think you do
Here we go let it show anywhere that I
Captivate you baby, let em stop and stare, but I
Won't let you get it cause we're gonna stop it there
Said I will resist you now

I will resist you, so don't even try
I need to fight it but it feels so right
You won't resist me, now don't deny
I try to hide it but it feels so good inside

I will resist you, so don't even try
I need to fight it but it feels so right
You won't resist me, now don't deny
I try to hide it but it feels so good inside

I will resist you, so don't even try
I need to fight it but it feels so right
You won't resist me, now don't deny
I try to hide it but it feels so good inside

I will resist you, so don't even try
I need to fight it but it feels so right
You won't resist me, now don't deny
I try to hide it but it feels so good inside

I will resist you, so don't even try
I need to fight it but it feels so right
You won't resist me, now don't deny
I try to hide it but it feels so good inside
