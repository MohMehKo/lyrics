I'm Simon Curtis
Human cyborg relations

Perfect model knows how to push the throttle
But I don't wanna be just another name in your registry
I just wanted to see if my lust would be enough
To get me over your complete lack of substance

Fell in love with an Android baby
Playing games with a toy that played me
The electricity is easy I'm told
So where'd you ever learn to be so cold?

Nothing in your eyes that I can see
Time to shut the power down and let me be
Try to play it like you think you're something so hot
Hate to say it, but I'd rather fuck a robot

So deluded that it kind of constituted as a
Kind of charm
I never really thought you could bring me any harm
Ooh, I couldn't be more wrong
Ooh, why did I wait so long to go
Can't believe I thought I loved you

Human cyborg relations
Human cyborg relations
Human cyborg relations (I'd rather fuck a robot)
Human cyborg relations (Ooh...)

A robot, robot, robot...

Ooh, pull down the nylons
You must be Cylon
Ooh, pull down the nylons
You must be Cylon
