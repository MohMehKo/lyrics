Little boy blue, whatcha gonna do?
Listen what they tell you, or think for yourself?
Do you, know the truth? or is it in an agenda and you can't tell?
I know, also, I see different, sides of things I only thought I knew

Turn off the mic, let another voice through
Hear a little reason through the subterfuge
Alert the media, what does it mean to ya?
Left right left right
Left all the schhh, there's another choice too
Life will turn to treason when you get confused
Sitting on the soldiers, doing what they told ya
Left right left right left

Nice to see, 
It's coming from the people that should know better
I see hypocrisy, getting off the hook, but I won't let ya
Politicians, wax poetic
Live on things they only think they know

Turn off the mic, let another voice through
Hear a little reason through the subterfuge
Alert the media, what does it mean to ya?
Left right left right
Left all the schhh, there's another choice too
Life will turn to treason when you get confused
Sitting on the soldiers, doing what they told ya

Realistic kingdom-ness is killing this country
Where is the intelligent responsibility?
If you let the people vote themselves in treasury 
Give them time, they will ensure they always soon will be,
Soon will be,
Soon will be,
Soon will be

Left, right, left,
Left, right, left,
Left, right, left,
Left, right, left,
Indulge every decadence,
Don't fear the consequence,
Blinders up, they claim to see
No responsibility

Turn off the mic, let another voice through
Hear a little reason through the subterfuge
Alert the media, what does it mean to ya?
Left right left right
Left all the schhh, there's another choice too
Life will turn to treason when you get confused
