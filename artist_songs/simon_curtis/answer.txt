I'm missing things that I never knew I wasted
I'm craving things that I've never really tasted
I had the time but I think that I misplaced it
I'll send a sign if you promise to erase it

And now you tell me that you can't stay tonight
You gotta let your body just breathe, breathe, breathe
Don't even try to intellectualize
You gotta let me in and just ease, ease, ease

Oh baby I gotta hear your answer
Oh baby just give me one more try
Oh baby you leave me a disaster
Lying here, crying here, waiting for your answer

I see you want it, no one ever would suspect it
We're getting closer and they never would detect it
I have to say that this is something unexpected
But if you're cool then I will never second guess it

I see you're worried but I swear it's alright
You gotta let your body just breathe, breathe, breathe
We've got no worries so let me come inside
You gotta let me in and just ease, ease, ease

Oh baby I gotta hear your answer
Oh baby just give me one more try
Oh baby you leave me a disaster
Lying here, crying here, waiting for your answer

And I feel that we waited too long
And I feel that I need another opportunity
I feel cheated 'cause I don't understand why we can't
And you won't give me an answer

Oh baby I gotta hear your answer
Oh baby just give me one more try
Oh baby you leave me a disaster
Lying here, crying here, waiting for your answer

And I feel that we waited too long
And I feel that I need another opportunity
I feel cheated 'cause I don't understand why we can't
And you won't give me an answer

Oh baby I gotta hear your answer
Oh baby just give me one more try
Oh baby you leave me a disaster
Lying here, crying here, waiting for your answer
