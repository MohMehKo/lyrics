Standing here
All at once
All the words run dry

Something changed
Can't explain
And I can't deny

Turning in circles
And blurring the lights

The unspoken is calling us tonight

I won't lie
I'm a little bit frightend
Of my imagination
Swear I'll try
I'm feeling enlightened
Your my inspiration
We can fly if we want to
I promise you that faith will give you wings

Just take the second star on the right
Straight ahead till morning light

Just take the second star on the right
Straight ahead till morning light

Every word and every sentence
Doesn't seem to make a difference
Nothing can explain just what you mean to me

Every shape and all the colours
All the love from all the lovers
Never quite express just what you mean to me

(Every shape) Every instinct
Every feeling (Every breath)
Breathless
All my senses reeling (All my senses reeling)
Cannot even say just

What you mean to me

Turning in circles
And blurring the lights

I won't lie
I'm a little bit frightened (Sylvia in cannon)
Of my imagination
I swear I'll try
But I'm feeling enlightened
You're my inspiration (Now together)

We can fly if we want to
I promise you faith will give you wings
Just take the second star on the right straight ahead till morning light
Just take the second star on the right straight ahead till morning light

Every star that's ever fallen
Knows the way to where we're going
Now I really know just what you mean to me...
