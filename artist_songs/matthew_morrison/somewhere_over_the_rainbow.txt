Somewhere over the rainbow way up high,
There's a land that I dreamed of once in a lullaby
haaaaai

Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true
Uuuuuh

oooh someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me.

Oh somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow.
Why then, oh why can't I?
