[Verse 1]
On the rooftop thinkin' it's about to pour
People run for shelter, tryin' to get out that storm
But I got you with me, the sun behind me
So what are we leavin' for? Let's stay. Let's get carried away
Your eyes are beggin' me to touch you there
Could be a thousand people watchin' but we don't care

[Chorus]
But look at you tonight, so beautiful under these neon lights, yeah
Who needs lovers' lane? Right up on this rooftop, let's make love in the summer rain

[Verse 2]
Nothin' better than givin' this all to you
And the weather's only adding to the mood
See the wind's blowin', fire's growin', both of us soakin' wet
But let's stay, yeah. Let's get carried away
Your eyes are beggin' me to touch you there
Could be a thousand people watchin' but we don't care

[Chorus]
But look at you tonight, so beautiful under these neon lights, yeah
Who needs lovers' lane? Right up on this rooftop, let's make love in the summer rain

There's no place that I'd rather make love to you
Right here on this roof, yeah
Look at you tonight, so beautiful under these neon lights, yeah
Who needs lovers' lane? Right up on this rooftop, let's make love in the summer rain
Look at you tonight, so beautiful under these neon lights, yeah
Who needs lovers' lane? Right up on this rooftop, let's make love in the summer rain
