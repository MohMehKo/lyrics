I'm singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain,
What a glorious feeling,
And I'm happy again.

I'm laughing at clouds
So dark, up above,
The sun's in my heart
And I'm ready for love.

Let the stormy clouds chase.
Everyone from the place,
Come on with the rain
I have a smile on my face.

I'll stroll down the lane
With a happy refrain
Just singin', singin' in the rain.

I'm singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain,
What a glorious feeling,
I'm so happy again.

I'm laughing at clouds
So dark, up above,
The sun's in my heart
And I'm ready for love.

Let the stormy clouds chase.
Everyone from the place,
Come on with the rain
I have a smile on my face.

I'll stroll down the lane
With a happy refrain
I'm dancin' and singin' in the rain.
