[Barrie:]
I see it all around us
In every single color
And every dimension
Crowns the reinvention

And if it is black
Then it's white
And when it is dark
Then it's light
So fill in all the spaces
With imaginary places

It's so frustrating
When no one else sees
Everything you see
So for now it is just an illusion, confusion
Unless you're someone who believes

When you look
Tell me what do you see?
[Peter:]
Just a dog in a park

[Barrie:]
Is it real?
Is it fiction
Only make believe?
You act like you really don't care

[Peter:]
Look with your eyes

[Barrie:]
But I look with your eyes
He's a great Russian bear

And he's dancing and prancing
And bowing politely
He plays to full houses once daily
Twice nightly
Prefix "ordinary" with "extra" you'll see
Believe, believe, believe

[Barrie (Peter):]
I don't need rose-tinted spectacles
(A dog, a rock, a bench, a bone)
Just to see the fundamentals
(A twig, a stick, a can, a stone)

[Barrie:]
I only see the bright lights

[Peter:]
A cloudy sky

[Sylvia:]
The sunset and the sunrise

[Peter:]
Don't lie

[Barrie:]
And if it is weak

[George:]
Then it's strong!

[Peter:]
It's not strong!

[Barrie:]
And just when it's right

[Jack:]
Then it's wrong!

[Peter:]
It's not wrong!

[Barrie, Sylvia, George, Jack & Michael:]
And everything my eyes see

[Peter:]
Everything my eyes see

[Barrie, Sylvia & 3 Boys:]
Is nothing like it should be

[Peter:]
Is only like it should be

[Barrie, Sylvia & 3 Boys:]
It's so frustrating
When no one else sees
Everything you see
So for now it is just an illusion, confusion

[Barrie, Sylvia, 3 Boys & Ensemble (Sylvia):]
Unless you're someone who believes
When you look
Tell me what do you see
(You can believe!)
Is it real?
Is it fiction
Only make believe?

You may think we're safe on the path
(You must believe)
But the grass is the water that's rising too fast

[Sylvia:]
And now Kensington park
Is the biggest lagoon
[Barrie:]
And this bench is a rock
[All:]
And we're all marooned here
Hear the mermaids sing their beautiful song!

[All:]
When you look
Tell me what do you see?
You can believe
Is it real?
Or a mystery scientifically?

It's more than a bench in the park
You must believe
Look again
It's rocket that's headed for Mars
On a mission to search for new life

When we'll be back who knows
'Cause it's really a long flight

Turn the whole world upside down
And you'll see
Believe, believe, believe

(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Barrie & (All):]
With just imagination
(Ha, ha, ha)
And creative speculation
(Ha, ha, ha)
Our life's calling
Was never meant to be boring

[Ensamble:]
No!

[All:]
Believe, believe,
Believe, believe,
Believe, believe,
Believe, believe,
Believe, believe
Believe, believe,
Believe!, believe,
Believe!
