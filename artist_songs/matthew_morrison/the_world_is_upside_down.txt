[Barrie:]
Welcome my friends
Glad you could join me on this most auspicious day

I hope you'll forgive
Mistakes and errors
We're just getting under way

You may recognize some of the scenes
You all played a part in sowing the seeds

‘Cause there is magic here in my imagination
Just believe and it can be a creation
The stories we invented
All the fun that we found
Appearing here before your eyes
The world is upside down!

[Miss Bassett:]
Our characters

[Miss Jones:]
Nibs and Tootles...?

[Miss Bassett:]
What is their motivation?

Because you see, I have to live and breathe my part, drawing from my own life experience...

[Barrie:]
Nibs is a lost boy

[Miss Bassett:]
Lost! Good, interesting

[Miss Jones:]
Yes...

[Miss Bassett:]
That I can use

[Miss Jones:]
Good, right

[Miss Bassett:]
Is he lost in an emotional purgatory?
...or lost in an existential search for himself? 

[Miss Jones:]
Yes!

[Barrie:]
No, he's just lost

[Miss Bassett:]
Good heavens! 
Where, when, and how?

[Barrie:]
Do you have experience being lost?

[Miss Bassett & Miss Jones:]
We're experiencing it now

[Mr. Henshaw:]
Dogs!

[Miss Potter:]
Boys!

[Mr. Cromer:]
Flying!

[Miss Bassett:] Lost!

[Frohman:]
So...

[Actors:]
Frustration!

[Barrie & Boys:]
Believe and it can 

[Actors:]
No!

[Barrie & Boys:]
Be a creation

[Miss Bassett:]
Actors don't fly...

[Mr. Cromer:]
Because actors could die!

[Boys:]
Start by saying I can do 
And then you can try

[Miss Jones:]
I can't

[Miss Potter:]
I won’t

[Mr. Henshaw:]
Will not

[Mr. Turrin:]
Not me

[Actors:]
There is no magic in your imagination
I do not believe in your new creation
This disaster is all due to your play
This could be my last first day

[Mr. Cromer:]
Nauseous!

[Miss Potter:]
Anxious...

[Mr. Henshaw:]
My reputation!

[Miss Bassett & Miss Jones:]
Playing lost?

[Actors:]
Get lost!
Serious actors cannot work this way!

[Frohman:]
A positive start!

[Actors:]
The world is upside down!

What you mean to me

[Barrie:]
Standing here
All at once
All the words run dry

[Sylvia:]
Something changed
Can't explain
And I can't deny

[Barrie:]
Turning in circles
And blurring the lines

[Both:]
The unspoken is calling us tonight

I won't lie
I'm a little bit frightened of my imagination

Swear I'll try
But I'm feeling enlightened
You’re my inspiration

We can fly if we want to
I promise
Faith will give you wings

[Barrie:]
Just take the second star on the right
Straight ahead ‘till the morning light

[Both:]
Just take the second star on the right
Straight ahead ‘till morning light

[Barrie:]
Every word and every sentence
Doesn't seem to make a difference
Nothing can explain 
Just what you mean to me

[Sylvia:]
Every shape and all the colours
All the love from all the lovers
Never quite express 
Just what you mean to me

[Barrie & Sylvia:]
Every instinct
Every Feeling
Breathless
All my senses reeling
Cannot even say
Just what you mean to me

Turning in circles
And blurring the lines

I won't lie
I'm a little bit frightened of my imagination
I swear I'll try
You’re my inspiration

We can fly if we want to
I promise
Faith will give you wings

Just take the second star on the right 
Straight ahead ‘till the morning light

Just take the second star on the right 
Straight ahead ‘till the morning light

Every star that's ever fallen
Knows the way to where we're going
Now I really know 
Just what you mean to me
