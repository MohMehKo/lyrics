I met her on the day of New Year's Eve,
I was shoppin' for a powder blue tux on Ardmore Street,
I swear that I saw fire in her eyes,
The kind of girl you hear about but never see in real life,
Everyone needs something,
Everyone wants love,

[Chorus]
She's lying in my bed,
In just her underwear,
She's laughing at the words I say,
We're kissing and we're touching,
Underneath the covers,
Listening to Marvin Gaye,
I hear her whispering "I love you",
Right before I fall sleep
A boy can dream, dream, dream
A boy can dream, dream, dream
A boy can dream, dream, dream
A boy can dream, dream, dream

I woke up on Sunday afternoon,
I had to take the tux back hoping I would see her too
Something 'bout that way she looked at me
She keeps playing in my head,
Like a broken record on repeat.
Everyone needs something,
Everyone wants love

[Chorus]
She's lying in my bed,
In just her underwear,
She's laughing at the words I say,
We're kissing and we're touching,
Underneath the covers,
Listening to Marvin Gaye,
I hear her whispering "I love you",
Right before I fall sleep
A boy can dream, dream, dream
A boy can dream, dream, dream
A boy can dream, dream, dream
A boy can dream, dream, dream

If I only had her number,
I know later on tonight,
Tonight, tonight

[Chorus]
She'd be lying in my bed,
In just her underwear,
She's laughing at the words I say,
We'd be kissing and be touching,
Underneath the covers,
Listening to Marvin Gaye,
I'd hear her whispering "I love you",
Right before I'd fall sleep
A boy can dream, dream, dream
A boy can dream, dream, dream
A boy can dream, dream, dream

I met her on the day of New Year's Eve,
I was shoppin' for a powdered blue tux on Ardmore Street?
