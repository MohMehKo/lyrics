[Peter:]
Hello!

[Barrie:]
Oh! What are you doing in my imagination?

[Peter:]
I’m not in your imagination, you’re in my imagination

[Barrie:]
No, you’re in

[Peter:]
Let’s wake up the others!

[Barrie:]
How?

[Peter:]
I’ve an idea
Let’s wake them with a tinkle of a fairy’s wing

[Barrie:]
What do we have here?
Some magic dust to sprinkle
That’s the very thing!

[Peter:]
Let’s start with George,
Michael, Jack, and then Mum

[Barrie:]
And how ‘bout the servants…?

[Peter:]
They should join in the fun!

We’ll have a party in a secret location
They just need a secret invitation

[Peter & Barrie:]
We’ll be right under their noses
But we’re just out of sight
Permissions to be naughty
Is our god given right

[Sylvia:]
Good heavens, what are we doing?

[Beatrice:]
Bloody hell!

[Albert:]
What the flippin heck’s all this then?

[Peter:]
We’re having our party!
[Servants:]
That truly sounds like madness

[Boys, Barrie & Sylvia:]
But entertaining
So let’s share the gladness
There’s no explaining

[All:]
We’ll be right under their noses
But we’re just out of sight
I’m sure there’ll be a price to pay
(I’m sure there’ll be a price to pay)
There’ll be a price to pay!
But ‘till then we own the night

Under the ground where no one knows
We’ve made a hideout for ourselves
We’ll have a feast of all the things we love to eat
But nothing else

[George:]
Imagine there’s ice cream

[Michael:]
Custard and cake

[Jack & Peter:]
And as much jelly as your belly can take

[All:]
For there’s a party in a secret location
You just need a secret invitation
We’ll be right under their noses
But we’re just out of sight
I’m sure there’ll be a price to pay
But ‘till then we own the night

[All:]
Oh! How we love this madness
So entertaining
We’ll be sharing gladness
They’ll be complaining
We’ll be right under their noses
But we’re just out of sight
I’m sure there’ll be a price to pay
(I’m sure there’ll be a price to pay)
There’ll be a price to pay
‘Till then we own the night
