What good is melody?
What good is music?
If it ain't possessing something sweet

It ain't the melody
It ain't the music
There's something else that makes this song complete

It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
(doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah)
Well it don't mean a thing, all you got to do is sing
(doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah)

It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just take that rhythm, give it everything you got
It don't mean a thing, all you got to do is sing

It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
(doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah)
Well it don't mean a thing all you got to do is sing
(doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah)

It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just take that rhythm, give it everything you got
It don't mean a thing, all you got to do is sing

(doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah...)
