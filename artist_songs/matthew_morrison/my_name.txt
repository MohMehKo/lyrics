It's always early
It's always dark when I leave
I check myself in the mirror
And he looks a lot like me

It could be London
But he's followed me back home
I'm not complainin'
But I wish he'd just stay in Rome
He isn't always right, you know...

They smile, they came
But they don't know my name
We only look the same
And they don't know my name.
Oh, turn the lights off
Turn all the lights off
All this love surrounds me
But I'm still alone

Your expectations,
I'm never gonna measure up.
I'm not a hero,
I know I never was taught enough.

They're screaming at me,
And I just wanna scream right back
They wouldn't believe it
I know he'd never do a thing like that.
It's taken all I've got not to crack.

They smile, they came
But they don't know my name
We only look the same
And they don't know my name.
Oh, turn the lights off
Turn all the lights off
All this love surrounds me
But I'm still alone

I only have to play the part.
But that part is only part of me
Once in a while, let down my guard
But it's hard, afraid of what you'll see.
I didn't mean to disappoint
But I'm not, who you think I am
I'm maybe not, who I think I am

They smile, they came
But they don't know my name
We only look the same
But they don't know my name.

They smile, they came
But they don't know my name
We only look the same
And they don't know my name.
Oh, turn the lights off
Turn all the lights off
Oh, turn the lights off
Turn all the lights off
Oh, turn the lights off
Turn all the lights off
All this love surrounds me,
But I'm still alone...
