There's a moment you've been waiting all your life for
When you find the very reason you're alive for
And it happens when you seem to least expect it
All at once you come alive and feel connected

I ignored the beat inside my heart for too long
Had accepted what was right
But always felt wrong
It's the second hand of time I'd been a slave to
But inside there was a feeling
Something I always knew

When the world turned upside down
And the earth and sky changed around
All the whispers of the possible became clear and loud
When the world turned upside down
When my world turned upside down
