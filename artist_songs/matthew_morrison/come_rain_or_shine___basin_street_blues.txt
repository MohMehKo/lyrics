I'm gonna love you, like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain, deep as a river
Come rain or come shine
I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't you ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me

You're gonna love me, like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
And won't that be fine
Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine

Won't you come along with me
To the Mississippi
We'll take the boat to the land of dreams
Steamin' down the river down to New Orleans

The band's there to meet us
And old friends to greet us
Where all the light and the dark folk meet
Heaven on earth they call it Basin Street

Basin Street is the street
Where the elite always meet
Down in New Orleans, land of dreams
You'll never know how nice it seems
Or just how much it really means

Glad to be, yes-siree,
Welcome's free and dear to me
Where I can't lose my Basin Street Blues

You're gonna love me, like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
And won't that be fine
Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine
I'm with you rain or shine
I'm with you rain or shine...
