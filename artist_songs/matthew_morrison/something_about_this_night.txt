[Frohman:]
I can feel it
Anticipation in the air
Something just beyond compare
To any other night I swear

I can feel my heart is beating much too fast
No more looking to the past
Could this be the one at last?

[Frohman & Elliot:]
Oh, all the years I have waited for this one night is everything
I can't be certain but something is different
I'm sure I have never felt like this before

[Actors:]
Something about this night that I cannot express
Excitement or nervousness
How it ends, I couldn't guess

But there is something about this night that I just can't ignore
All the sweat and tears and more
Have made this all worth fighting for

If there is one chance this could be the one to beat our expectationâ€¦

[Frohman:]
Something about this night

[Actors:]
Oh, something about this night

[Barrie:]
At the start of the show when nobody knows
Just what to expect or believe
The tension is high and the silence is loud
And it's getting much harder to breathe

[Peter:]
I'm so proud of what you created
After all of the time you have waited

[Peter & Barrie:]
I wanted to say but the words wouldn't come out right
It must be something about this night

[Actors:]
Something about this night that I just can't ignore
All the sweat and tears and more
Have made this all worth fighting for
If there is one chance this could be the one for every generation

Something about this night
Oh, something about this night
Oh, something about this night!
