[Matthew Morrison:]
And know I know "Spanish Harlem" are 
not just pretty words to say 

[Elton John:]
I thought I knew but now I know rose trees 
never grow in New York city 

[Matthew Morrison:]
Until you see this trash can dream come true 
you stand at the edge while people run you through 

[Elton John:]
And I thank the Lord, there's people out there like you 
I thank the Lord there's people out there like you 

[Matthew Morrison:]
While Mona Lisas and mad hatters, 
sons of bankers, sons of lawyers, 
Turn around and say "Good morning" to the night 
for unless they see the sky but they can't and that is why 
they know not if it's dark outside or light. 

[Elton John:]
While Mona Lisas and mad hatters,

[Elton John:]
She packed my bags last night pre-flight 
zero hour 9 am 
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then 

[Matthew Morrison:]
I miss the earth so much I miss my wife 
It's lonely out in space 
On such a timeless flight (Timeless flight) 

[Elton John:]
And I think it's gonna be a long long time 
Till touch down brings me round again to find 
I'm not the man they think I am at home 
Oh no no no I'm a rocket man 
[Together:] Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone 

[Matthew Morrison:]
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids 
In fact it's cold as hell 
And there's no one there to raise them if you did 

[Elton John:]
And all this science I don't understand (don't, don't understand) 
It's just my job five days a week 
[Together:] A rocket man, 
A rocket man 

Matthew Morrison 
And I think it's gonna be a long long time 
Till touch down brings me round again to find 
I'm not the man they think I am at home 
Oh no no no 
[Together:] I'm a rocket man; rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone 

[Elton John & Matthew Morrison:]
And I think it's gonna be a long long time 

[Elton John:]
Till touch down brings me round again to find 
I'm not the man they think I am at home 
Oh no no no I'm a rocket man

[Elton John:]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time 

[Matthew Morrison:]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time 

[Elton John:]
Yeah, I think it's gonna be a long, long time (long, long time) 

[Matthew Morrison:]
Yes, I think it's gonna be a long, long time (long, long time) 

[Elton John:]
Oh, long, long time. 

[Matthew Morrison:]
Yeah, I think it's gonna be a long, long time 

[Elton John:]
Long, long time 

[Matthew Morrison:]
Mona lisas and mad hatters 

[Elton John:]

[Matthew Morrison:]
Sons of bakers, sons of lawyers 

[Elton John:]
Sons of bakers, sons of lawyers 

[Matthew Morrison:]
Turn around to say good morning to the night 

[Elton John:]
Mona Lisas and mad hatters 
Sons of bakers, sons of lawyers
