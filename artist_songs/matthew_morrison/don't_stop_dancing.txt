And it feels like an endless December that chills
Black mascara that runs down your pretty face
Your smile is outta place, days got you down
But things are lookin' up, up, up

Find yourself in a dream with the city of sky
And the sound that you hear's like a heart that beats
Moving you close to me, it's like a symphony
That's playin' for us

Two shadows under a streetlight
We're just dancin' in the rain
Bodies flowin' like water
We'll be alright
As long as we don't stop dancing, dancing
Don't stop dancing, dancing
Don't stop dancing, dancing
Don't stop dancing, dancing

Pray for time, tell tomorrow to wait for a while
Wanna take the moments and have always been
Back on our feet again, the world is sleeping
But we're wide awake

Two shadows under a streetlight
We're just dancin' in the rain
Bodies flowin' like water
We'll be alright
As long as we don't stop dancing, dancing
Don't stop dancing, dancing
Don't stop dancing, dancing
Don't stop dancing, dancing

I just wanna make you feel the music
Throw your hands up in the air
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everything you're looking for
You'll keep findin' on the floor
Cause I know how to make you feel better, better

Two shadows under a streetlight
We're just dancin' in the rain
Bodies flowin' like water
We'll be alright
As long as we don't stop dancing, dancing
Don't stop dancing, dancing
Don't stop dancing, dancing
Don't stop dancing, dancing
Don't stop dancing, dancing
