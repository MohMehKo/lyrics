[Barrie:]
In the darkest place
There’s the faintest light
Gives me hope to face the hardest fight

Pain delivers me
I don't need their sympathy
‘Cause they can't take away my mind
Where I go they will never find

I've got to be stronger
Reach up higher
Must dig deeper
Find the fire

Feel enlightened
Can't be frightened anymore

[Barrie & Hook / Pirates:]
I can run now so much faster
Now defeat won't be my master

For to conquer the demons
I won't have to wait any longer
I've got to be stronger

[Pirates:]
Take the line
Top the mast
Steady!
Pull!
Whoa…

[Hook:]
You'll see in time
You will survive
Too soon to run
Too late to hide
It's your destiny
Every pace, every stride

[Barrie, Hook & Pirates:]
I am stronger
Reach up higher
Digging deeper
Found the fire

Feel enlightened
Won't be frightened anymore

I can run now so much faster
Now defeat won't be my master

I will conquer the demons
I won’t have to wait any longer

[Barrie:]
I’ve got to be stronger
I am stronger
Now I’m stronger
