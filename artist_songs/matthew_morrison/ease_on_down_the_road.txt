Come on and
Ease on down, 
Ease on down the road come on, 
Ease on down, 
Ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing that might be a load come on, 
Ease on down 
Ease on down, down the road

Come on and
Ease on down, 
Ease on down the road
Come on and
Ease on down, 
Ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing that might be a load
Come on
Ease on down, 
Ease on down, down the road

Pick your left foot up, when your right foot is down
Come on legs keep moving and don't you lose no ground
You just keep on keeping on those broken shoes
Don't you give up walking cause you gave up shoes

Ease on down, 
Ease on down, down the road
Ease on down, 
Ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing that might be a load
Come on
Ease on down, 
Ease on down, down the road

Cause there may be times when you think you lost your mind
And the steps you're taking leave you three four steps behind
But the road you're walking might be long sometimes
You just keep on stepping and you'll be just fine (yeah)

Ease on down the road
Ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing that might be a load
Come on
Ease on down, 
Ease on down, the road

Well there may be times, when you wish you wasn't born
And you wake one morning just to find your courage gone
But you know that feeling only last a little while
you just stick with us we'll show you how to smile (yeah)

Get 'em up, goin' down (ease on down the road)
Get 'em up, goin' down (ease on down the road)
Get 'em up, goin' down(ease on down the road)
Get 'em up Get 'em up (ease on down the road)
