She doesn't act as though she cares,
but deep inside I know she cares,
and this is why I'm tied, right by her side

As longs as she needs me
I know where I must be
I'll cling on steadfastly
As longs as she needs me
As long as life is long
I'll love her, right or wrong
And somehow I'll be strong
As long as she needs me

If you are lonely then you will know
When someone needs you, you love them so
I won't betray her trust
Though people say I must
I've got to stay true just
As longs as she needs me

If you are lonely then you will know
When someone needs you, you love them so
I won't betray her trust
Though people say I must
I've got to stay true just
As longs as she needs me
