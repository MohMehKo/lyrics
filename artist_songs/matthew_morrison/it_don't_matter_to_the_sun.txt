It don't matter to the sun
If you go or if you stay
You know the sun is gonna rise, gonna rise
Shine down on a another day
There will still be a tomorrow
Even if you choose to leave
Cause it don't matter to the sun, baby
But it matters to me

It ain't gonna stop the world, no
If you walk out that door
This old world just keeps turning round, turning round
Like it did the day before
You see to them it makes no difference
They just keep on keeping time
Cause it ain't gonna stop the world, after you baby
But it'll be the end of mine

What can I say?
What can I do?
I'm still in love.
So why aren't you?

It don't matter to the moon
Well, if you're not in my life
No the moon will just keep hanging round, hanging round, hanging round
Like it's just another night
Find another place to shine down
On some other lover's dreams
Cause it don't matter to the moon, baby
But it matters to me

What can I say?
What can I do?
I'm still in love.
So why aren't you?

And there will still be a tomorrow
Even if you choose to leave
It don't matter to the sun, baby
But it matters to me
It don't matter to the sun, baby
But it sure does matter to me
