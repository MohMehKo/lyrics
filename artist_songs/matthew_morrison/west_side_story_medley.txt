When you're a Jet,
You're a Jet all the way
From your first cigarette
To your last dyin' day.

When you're a Jet,
If the spit hits the fan,
You got brothers around,
You're a family man!
You're never alone,
You're never disconnected!
You're home with your own:
When company's expected,
You're a Jet,
You’re a Jet
You're the swingin'est kind of cat
You’re a Jet

Could it be? Yes, it could.
Something's coming, something good,
If I can wait!
Something's coming, I don't know what it is,
But it is
Gonna be great!

Around the corner,
Or whistling down the river,
Come on, deliver
To me!

Easy does it
Easy does it
Stay loose boy
Got a rocket in your pocket
Keep cooley cool boy
Go man, go
But not like the crazy schoolboy
Just play it cool boy
Real cool
Real cool
Real cool

I like to be in America!
O.K. by me in America!
Ev'rything’s free in America
For a small fee in America!

Tonight, tonight,
Won't be just any night,
Tonight there will be no morning star.
Tonight, tonight, I'll see my love tonight.
And for us, stars will stop where they are.
Today
The minutes seem like hours,
The hours go so slowly,
And still the sky is light...

The most beautiful sound I ever heard:
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria...
All the beautiful sounds of the world in a single word...
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria...
Maria!
I've just met a girl named Maria,
And suddenly that name
Will never be the same
To me.
Maria!
I've just kissed a girl named Maria,
And suddenly I've found
How wonderful a sound
Can be!
Maria!
Say it loud and there's music playing,
Say it soft and it's almost like praying.

Maria,
I'll never stop saying Maria!

The most beautiful sound I ever heard.
Maria.
