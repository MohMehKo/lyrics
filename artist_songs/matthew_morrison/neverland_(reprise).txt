[Frohman:]
Act One, Scene One... a nursery!

[Peter:]
It's the Darling House. And look, see?
Preparing the beds is Nana, the family dog, because the Darlings couldn't afford a real nanny.
But it didn't matter, because they were happy and didn't care.

[Sylvia:]
Oh, Peter.

"Michael"
I won't go to bed! I won't! I won't!

[Michael:]
That's what I say!

"NANA" barks

"Michael"
Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet!

"NANA" barks

"Michael"
Alright, I'm going to bed.

"Peter" crows

[Peter:]
And then, the most amazing boy flies in through the window!

[Sylvia:]
Goodness, a boy who flies!

"Peter" weeps

"Wendy"
Why are you crying?

"Peter"
I wasn't crying. But I can't get my shadow to stick on.

"Wendy"
It has come off! How awful! You've been trying to stick it on with soap!

"Peter"
Well then?

"Wendy"
It must be sewn on.

[Barrie:]
And so Wendy sews on Peter's shadow...

[Peter:]
...and Peter is so happy he dances with it around the room!

"Peter"
Wendy, one girl is worth more than twenty boys.

"Wendy"
I shall give you a kiss, Peter, If you like.

"Peter"
Thank you.

"Wendy"
Don't you know what a kiss is?

"Peter"
I shall know one when you give it to me.

"Barrie"
And so not to hurt his feelings, Wendy gives Peter a thimble for his finger.

"Peter"
Now shall I give you a kiss?

"Wendy"
If you please.

[Peter:]
And in return, Peter gives Wendy an acorn.

"Wendy"
Thank you, Peter. I shall wear it on a chain around my neck.

[Michael:]
That's not a kiss, even I know that!

[Jack:]
That's the point! It's clever!

[Peter:]
And then, this is my favorite bit. Peter shows Wendy how to fly!

[Barrie:]
We can sail away tonight
On a sea of pure moonlight
We can navigate the stars
To bring us back home
In a place so far away

[Boys:]
We are young
That's how we'll stay.

[Sylvia:]
And with your hand in my hand

[Barrie & Sylvia:]
We will find ourselves
In Never Neverland

[Jack:]
Pirates!

[Peter:]
That's Captain James-Hook. He's the most dastardly rouge that ever lived.

[Frohman:]
Oh. I love this guy! He's such a good for nothing scoundrel!

"Hook"
Peter flung my arm to a crocodile! And he liked it so much, he's followed me ever since, from land to land and sea to sea, licking his lips for the rest of me.
Oy, It's the crocodile!

[George:]
Indians! Like the characters we invited in the park!

[Boys:]
While we were make-believing
Mr. Barrie was writing all the while

[Mrs. Du Maurier:]
Yes, a lot of this seems rather familiar...

[George:]
Yes look, there are pirates

[Jack:]
And Indians!

[George:]
And fairies!

[Jack:]
Even a crocodile!

[Mrs. Du Maurier:]
I hope I'm not the crocodile!

[Michael:]
I hear the mermaids
Such a beautiful sound

"Mermaids"
Ahh

[Peter:]
Just a little faith and both your feet leave the ground

[Mrs. Du Maurier:]
We can sail away tonight
On a sea of pure moonlight
We can navigate the stars
To bring us back home

In a place so far away
We'll be young
That's how we'll stay

Every wish is a command
In this special place
Here in Neverland

[Michael:]
Oh no, Tinker Bell!

[Mrs. Du Maurier:]
What is she saying, Peterr?

[Peter:]
She drank his medicine because
it was poisoned.

[Sylvia:]
She drank it to save his life?

[Michael:]
Isâ€¦ is Tink dying?

[George:]
Look. Her light is growing faint. If it goes out, that means she's dead.

[Peter:]
She says she thinks she can get well again, if children believe in fairies.

[Barrie:]
And do you? Do you believe in fairies?

[Peter:]
If you believe, clap your hands!

[Mrs. Du Maurier:]
I believe! Come along, children!

[Barrie:]
Everyone! Clap louder!!

[Barrie:]
That is Neverland.

Picture a land
That you never have seen
Where life is eternal and evergreen
A future of happiness all in your hands
All in this place of your dreams
Here inside Neverland

[Sylvia:]
Shooting stars
New shapes and sizes
Wakenings and new surprises
Opening my eyes to something happening

[Barrie:]
Neverland

[Sylvia:]
Universe of constant spinning
Every end and new beginning
I begin to feel that something's happening to me.

[Ensemble:]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

You just close your eyes
And count to ten
Breathe in twice
And open them

You know where to go
You have been there before
In your heart...

[Peter:]
And by closing my eyes
I'll be finding Neverland
