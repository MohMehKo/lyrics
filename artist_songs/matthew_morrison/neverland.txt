[Barrie:]
Whenever I was frightened
Or if I ever felt alone
I turned to the night sky
And a star I call my own

Somewhere I could run to
Just across the Milky Way
If you like I could take you
It's just a light year and a day

We can sail away tonight
On a sea of pure moonlight
We can navigate the stars
To bring us back home

In a place so far away
We'll be young
That's how we'll stay
Every wish is a command
We will find ourselves in Never Neverland

Picture a land that you never have seen
Where life is eternal and evergreen
A future of happiness all in your hands
All in this place of your dreams
Here inside Neverland

We can sail away tonight
On a sea of pure moonlight
We can navigate the stars
To bring us back home
In a place so far away

[Barrie & Sylvia:]
We'll be young
That's how we'll stay
Every wish is a command
We will find ourselves
In Never Neverland

[Barrie:]
Every wish is a command
I am closer now
To finding Neverland
