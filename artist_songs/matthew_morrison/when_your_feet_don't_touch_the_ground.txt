[Barrie:]
When did life become so complicated?
Years of too much thought and time I wasted
And in each line upon my face
Is a proof I fought and lived another day

When did life become this place of madness?
Drifting on an empty sea of waves of sadness
I make believe I'm in control
And dream it wasn't all my fault

When your feet don't touch the ground
When your world's turned upside down
Here it's safe
In this place
Above the clouds

When your feet don't touch the earth
You can't feel the things that hurt
And you're free
There's no need to come down

[Peter:]
Everyday just feels a little longer
Why am I the only one not getting stronger?
Running 'round pretending life's a play
It doesn't make the darkness go away

I may be young but I can still remember
Feeling full of joy, crying tears of laughter
Now all my tears are all cried out
Make believe, but count me out

'Cause my feet are on the ground
And the inner voice I found
Tells the truth
And there's no use
If your head's in the clouds

[Barrie:]
I was once like you
Life was a maze
I couldn't find my way out

But what I say is true
You'll be amazed
Make believe and you will find out that it's true

[Peter:]
I know what is true

[Barrie & Peter:]
When your feet don't touch the ground
When your feet touch the ground
And your voice won't make a sound
Your voice makes a sound

Here it's safe
It tells the truth
In this place above the clouds
There's no use for clouds

When your feet don't touch the earth
When your feet touch the earth
You can't feel the things that hurt
You can feel the things that hurt
And you're free
There's no need to come down
And I am fine as long as I am down

When your feet don't touch the ground
When your feet touch the ground
When your feet don't touch the ground
...touch the ground
