I see her looking but what does she see 
Just for this moment I wish I weren't me 
Cause I'm not the future she thought I would be 
It's over 

I know this feeling I felt it before 
All of the signs that she chose to ignore 
Didn't she notice my eye on the door 
It's over 

I could have told her the night that we met 
I'd be a love she would learn to regret 
I know her soul is so simple and true 
But she will forgive what I'm putting her through 
Forgiving myself will be harder to do 
When it's over 

When it's over 

It's over
