[Roshon:] Yeah, haha. Look, Roshon.
[Leon:] Leon. Oh, oh, oh.
[Roshon:] Let's go, ah!

[Leon:]
I don't need the finer things,
I just want you here with me,
So tell the big man you're the only thing,
He needs to bring is you underneath my tree.
All I want on the 25th is a mistletoe and you to kiss.
Baby, girl you know you got me going crazy, oh!

[Leon:]
All I want for Christmas,
All I want for Christmas is
You, you, you, you, you.
All that's on my wishlist,
All that's on my wishlist is
You, you, you, you, you, Yeah.

[Roshon:]
Oh little momma, I can't believe it.
You're all that I need; everything else I don't need it
You got me, yeah, you've got me.
I'll fight for your love like rocky.
And it's shocking how you got my heart ringing like sleigh bells.
You're the angel on my tree,
Above is where you fell from.
Our love is so dumb,
We'll never be done,
Christmas has come,
And you're all that I want.

[Leon:]
Oh, yeah, oh yeah,
So baby, stick around.
When the snow falls, 
I want you in my arms.
Every single second, you with me.
Take it to another level, 
Baby complete to my puzzle.
Baby, I don't want a present;
All I want is you – 
You're all I need for Christmas this year.

[Leon:]
All I want for Christmas,
All I want for Christmas is
You, you, you, you, you (Yeah)
All that's on my wishlist,
All that's on my wishlist is
You, you, you, you, you, yeah!

[Roshon:]
You are the best present of all,
The biggest gift to the world,
Your presence is all I need, I want,
Can't front your love it's so magnificent!
And girl, you got me feeling like 
This is the best Christmas ever.
We ain't gotta do nothing, 
As long as we're together.
Like birds to feather,
Rain to umbrellas,
Jingles to jingle bellas,
Baby, we are forever.

[Leon:]
Forever, Got me feeling right 
Every time that you're here, together.
Nothing can stop the love that we share.
And whether, I'm around the world,
Far away or real near, nothing's better,
Than having you for Christmas, 
Christmas, chri-chri-Christmas.

[Leon:]
All I want for Christmas,
All I want for Christmas is
You, you, you, you, you.
All that's on my wishlist,
All that's on my wishlist is
You, you, you, you, you.
[Repeat]

[Leon:] Yeah, all I want for Christmas is you. All I need
[Roshon:] All I want for Christmas, uh, all I want for Christmas is you.
[Leon:] Na, na, na, baby girl, all I need is you.
[Roshon:] Haha, Roshon, Leon.
[Leon:] Yeah, yeah,
[Roshon:] All I want for Christmas, is you, is you….
