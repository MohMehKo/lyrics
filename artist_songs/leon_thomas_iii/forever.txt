[Verse 1:]
Stop the world
Take a picture
Take a minute
'Cuz I missed ya
Till this day
Yeah, I can't believe
You're right in front of my face
You're right in front of my…
Subconsciously
In the night
I dreamed of her
And she came alive
She's so sweet
Hope she doesn't mind
Eat up all of her time
Eat up all of her…

[Hook:]
Hey, hey!
Hope you enjoy your stay
Feelin' good in the honeymoon stage
You'll find me
Ha, you'll find me…
When the sun goes down
And the star lights up my night
'Cuz she's around
Don't wanna let this moment
Go, whoa ho
Go, whoa ho, ha
But the question is
Will it be here…
Forever, forever-ever, forever-ever?
Ay, will it be here…
Forever, forever-ever, forever-ever?

[Verse 2:]
Speeding through life
Race cars
Fighting everyday
Battle scars
Badabada
Ha, yeah battle scars
But they always heal
With a little love

[Hook]

[Outro: Snippet from The Notebook]
Could you just stay with me?
Stay with you? What for? Look at us! We're already fighting!
Well that's what we do! We fight! I'm not afraid to hurt your feelings! They're like 2-second rebound rate, you're back doing the next pain-in-the-ass thing.
So what?
So, it's not going to be easy, it's gonna be really hard, we're gonna have to work with this everyday, but I want to do that because I want you, I want all of you, forever you and me, everyday, could you do something to me? Please? Could you just picture your life for me? 30 years from now? 40 years from now? What's it look like?
…Forever, forever-ever, forever-ever?
