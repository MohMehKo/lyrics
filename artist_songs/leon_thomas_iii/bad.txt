[Verse 1:]
Age ain't nothin
You ain't seen nothin
Girl I know I'm young but I can teach you somethin
I ain't tryna rush it
And no I ain't just crushin
But girl I'm tryna lock you down down, straight cuffin

[Hook:]
Ooh you bad
Ooh you bad

[Chorus:]
I'm tryna tell you that I'm young but I'm ready
You just gotta let me show me how them young boys do
You don't want a man that presses [?]
I don't think you get it
Baby all I want is you

[Hook:]
Ooh you bad
Ooh you bad
And I want you to be mine girl

[Verse 2:]
Anything you want
I can get you that
I be workin out on my pocket sweat
Where you wanna go
I can get you there
Anywhere you are
Girl I'll be right there

[Hook:]
Ooh you bad
Ooh you bad

[Chorus:]
I'm tryna tell you that I'm young but I'm ready
You just gotta let me show me how them young boys do
You don't want a man that presses [?]
I don't think you get it
Baby all I want is you

[Hook:]
Ooh you bad
Ooh you bad
And I want you to be mine girl
