[Verse 1:]
I wanna be more than those others
I hope that you can call me your friend
Never judge a book by it's cover
Cause I'm stil learning how to be a man

[Hook:]
To many toys to play
To many california barbie dolls
I used to play with em all
So pretty but they fake like plastic
So baby all I'm asking
Is for you to take a chance
Take a chance on me
Girl I'm begging you hoo to mold me
Cause I'm ready and I'm willing girl I'm like clay
Won't you mold me baby
All I want is you hoo to mold me
Cause I'm ready and I'm willing girl I'm like clay
Mold me baby

[Verse 2:]
When it comes to us there's no question
Everything I do revolves around you round you round ya
Girl if your the teacher I need a lesson
Send my heart in the right direction

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
You melt my heart baby
Take my heart
Shape it
You got me in the palm of your hand

[Hook]
