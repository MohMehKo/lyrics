[Verse 1:]
Some say I'm like a broken record,
Skip, skip right back to the day I met her
I forget her eyes, same thing 
That gets me every time yeah
The whole world saying I could do better
But I can't help but feel she's the best so
I give her more and more she gives me less so
I don't know how she got me so attached

[Hook:]
Here's my solution, 
I'm goin', I've been losing
I gotta keep it moving 
Cause right here is not where I'm supposed to be
I'mma run and I'll never come back [x2]
Broken heart in my Louis backpack, broken heart in my Louis Louis
I'mma run and I'll never come back, back
Shawty how you do me like that that, this time girl I won't look back

[Verse 2:]
Don't sweet talk me with the sorries and apologies
I know you begging me to stay, but I gotta leave
Can't breathe the same air as you oh
But your smile, oh your smile 
Makes you tough for me to walk away, but I can't stay

[Hook:]
Here's my solution, 
I'm goin', I've been losing
I gotta keep it moving 
Cause right here is not where I'm supposed to be
I'mma run and I'll never come back [x2]
Broken heart in my Louis backpack, broken heart in my Louis Louis
I'mma run and I'll never come back, back
Shawty how you do me like that that, this time girl I won't look back 

If I, I, I turn back I'll turn into stone,
I'm going away-ay-ay, I'm never coming home
(yeah) Turning into you, (yeah) turning into you, (yeah) turning into you, and (yeah) turning into you oh
(eh) Running into you, (eh) running into you, (eh) risk running into you, ooh ooh eh

I'mma run and I'll never come back [x2] 
Broken heart in my Louis backpack, broken heart in my Louis Louis
I'mma run and I'll never come back, back
Shawty how you do me like that that, this time girl I won't look back [repeat x2]
