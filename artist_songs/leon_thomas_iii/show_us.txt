New York boy at a West Coast party
Model chicks, dancing, high heel shawties
Tell me what's your name again
Where you really from
I can tell by the way you going hard
This ain't where you from
Everybody wants to be a star
I'll call you Miss Universe
Louis V. up on your purse
You just want it bad, don't ya
Silly mom and dad
They'll never see what you have, what you have

[Chorus:]
Baby, no the jungle ain't the place to go wild
Trynna' find your way, but you don't know how
This city's seen it all
So, girl, be careful what you show us, show us

Girl, you finally in the right place
Everybody rich and shit
Saw them 'round that rem tray
Drink it up [x2]
Right up on the counter top
No, good girls don't do that stuff [x2]
Maybe once, maybe once
Twice ain't never hurt nobody
YOLO till the morning come
Laying in somebody's arms
That you don't know
But you don't care, don't you
No, you don't care, don't you
You want it bad, don't you
You want it bad, baby

[Chorus x2:] 
Baby, no the jungle ain't the place to go wild
Trynna' find your way, but you don't know how
This city's seen it all
So, girl be careful what you show us, show us

She gone [x2]
You should know better, girl
The way she move is so wild, so wild
The way she move is wild
You should know better girl [x2]
