Tell me what should I do 
What should I say? 
I'm lost for words so I'm comin' to ya 
Sisters will you help me? 
See I don't know 
Where to start 
To find the keys 
To win over a girl's heart 

Well, they say just remember 
When your game comes into play 
(Watcha say?) 
Gain your composure, some respect 
And you'll be okay 
Because the ladies will like it when 
When you don't succeed, don't get offended 
Listen when she speaks and don't pretend 
And be always there when she needs a friend 
So many things about a girl I can't comprehend 

Ooh, ooh, ooh, I like that girl 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I like that girl 
Yeah, she says that she likes me too 
But she's to shy to come talk to me so 
I don't know how to make a move 
But I want her to be mine, mine, mine, mine, yeah 
(I want the baby girl to be mine) 

Is she the one who will give me love? 
(Real love) 
Love me for me I'm not askin' much 
'Cause true love don't come easily 
And if it's meant to be it happens naturally 
If you don't look for love it might actually find you 

Ooh, ooh, ooh, I like that girl 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I like that girl 
You know, mommy you're the best thing 
I ever seen come run my way and 
I want you to be down with me like I'm with you 
Yes you, girl you know you make me go 
Ooh yeah, girl 
Ya got me sayin' ooh yeah 
Ya got me sayin' ooh yeah 
Ya got me sayin' ooh yeah 

Alright, I'm feelin' everything you've been talkin' about 
And for her I need to kick the player out 
With no doubt it's been runnin' through my mind 
I can't believe true love I have found 
My world, she's forever 
My sunshine, my pot of gold at the end of the rainbow 
See, love is not about looks or material 
But it's meant to heart felt the spirit 

I like that girl, yeah 
I like that girl 
I like that girl, yeah 
I like that girl 
I like that girl 
Aw yeah, I like that girl, yeah
