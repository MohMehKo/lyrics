Slew them ah bear feelings them ah carry

And them can't say them sorry yah
Slew them ah bear feelings them ah carry
Unno want give them something fi me again?
Well yo-a-yo it name

[Chorus:]
Who them ah coulda? what that them ah try?
Them diss King Seallsi watch the whole of them die yeah
Who them and me go see them with them spell
Diss Emmanuel and them soul gone ah hell yow
Who them ah coulda who dem want cuss?
Diss Marcus and them all bite the dust yow
Who them? ah me go tell them fi splurt
Tell them them can't diss Mama Earth

You no see ah dead man them?
Duppy man them!
Me no inna nothing with them
The fire haffi burn them
Them done condemn

Them done no like and me and me done don't like them
Tell them say me nah keep no funny man friend
Tell them say me nah keep no sodamite friend
Nah go stoop low me trod the raggy roads them
This fire here, it red upon them, it name

[Chorus]

So me burn out them dirty heart them evil heart
And them corrupted corrupted talk
Wine too much ass
Snake under grass
Bow to the boss
Move too fast
Me tell them bout them ras
Who tell them fi provoke the youth them to wrath?
Now the youth say them nah trust no shadow after dark
Nah take not threat nor no fool fool talk
Them know who ah who, ah come straight from the heart
Know who ah hypocrite from the way how them talk
Diss the emperor and watch the whole of them loss
Can't even find food fi put inna them trough
Not even bicycle, much lest donkey cart
Can't even creep, much less fi walk
Them can't even smile nor laugh
That one here name

[Chorus]

Since the doggy way like they never get a pence
Seems like them go ah school and go warm bench
Dem n'ave no faith, no confidence
Nah hold no rights, them nah black no reverence
Find out say nuff of them disobedient
So me find them don't have no conscience
Them no have a clean heart nor a clear conscience
Diss King Selassie I it never make sense
Diss Emmanuel and get kick off of the bench
Diss Marcus Garvey and where the trails? dem get drenched
Who them who them?

[Chorus]

Dead dead dead, dead man them, duppy man them

Dead dead dead
Yo ah bear dead man dem, duppy man dem dead dead dead
Well ah bear dead woman them, duppy woman them
Dead dead dead
True, ah bear obeah man them, bear heathens them
