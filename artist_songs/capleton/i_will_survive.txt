I will survive
From my bees are alive
Honey's coming from the hive yo
Food is coming from my soil
Mama pot a fi boil
Food for the child

Well over the hills and through the valley on top of the mountain
Me seh Selassie I bless and I devote him
Listen to the birds when them a sing them anthem
Listen to the wind a with the whistling blend
Give thanks for the trees for ya produce oxygen
So me let out the lion name from all tongue again
And free all black people from mortality
Out of the mouthÂ [?]
Food is the stuff of life let they all be fed again
Righteousness the ghetto youth and seh keep it blazin

I will survive
From my bees are alive
Honey's coming from the hive yo
Food is coming from my soil
Mama pot a fi boil
Food for the child

So I'm trodding on my way
And I hail King Selassie whether night or day
Just by ya works and so ya cannot get to pay
So I have to chant a song today
And I have to pray along my way
And I have to pray to meet a brighter day
And hail King Selassie I no care what them a say
Blaze up the red

The one ya name
I will survive
From my bees are alive
Honey's coming from the hive yo
Food is coming from my soil
Mama pot a fi boil
Food for the child

Well some a say them blessed but them cursed
Nuff a dem no really know what life is worth
Every ghetto youth want fat up mama purse
Hail King Selassie I the first- Yo
Fire a go take them if them dis mama earth
Them civilization them a she give birth
Them get take the fire then tell them fi sure
Diss Emmanuel- you a jerk - the one ya name

I will survive
From my bees are alive
Honey's coming from the hive yo
Food is coming from the sun
Mama pot a fi boil
Food for the child
