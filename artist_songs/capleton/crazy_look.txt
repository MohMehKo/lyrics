[Chorus:]
Don't give me that crazy look
One of these days, then you gonna be mine
Don't give me that crazy look
I want a woman that pure and soul divine
Don't give me that crazy look
One of these days, then you gonna be mine
I need a woman that pure and soul divine

Mi want a woman weh pure
An' mi want one weh clean
(Oh) She affi have di vision an' a dream
An' she caan prang bust nuh M-16
An' she caan dutty, seh she affi clean
An' she affi straight, an' she caan lean
An' she affi kind, an' she caan mean
An' she affi hice up di red and di gold and di green
Inna har heart, she affi let rasta in

[Chorus]

Mi want a woman weh clean
Want one weh pure
Righteousness, she affi always adore
So mi can always all tek her pon tour
She affi mentally rich, she caan mentally poor
Physically rich, she caan physically poor
When she give me loving me affi holla out fi more
Loving weh she give mi seh it always secure
Righteousness, she affi always adore

[Chorus]

Mi want a woman weh clean
An' mi want weh fine
De woman weh mi want
She affi one of a kind
An' di wrong tree man weh seh she caan climb
She nuh fi deaf, she nuh fi dumb
She nuh fi cripple nor blind
Emperor Selassie a go show one fi sign
Bear good tings affi inna har mind
Nuh bad company, an' mi seh she caan join
(Oh) An' mi seh she caan play 69
(Oh)

[Chorus repeat until fade]
