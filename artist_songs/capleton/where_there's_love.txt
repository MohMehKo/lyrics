[Chorus:]
Where there is love
Hate can't overcome

Where there is peace
War can't overcome

Where there is life
Death can't overcome

Where there is hope
Faith will overcome

[Verse 1:]
Look wa the world gone to
Yes dem all a blow the wrong horn to
A bare evil dem a perform to
And if you ever tell dem fi form to
Well dem would a laugh you to scorn to
The least thing dem go, go inform to
Dem go a the obeah man gone balm to
But wait till the judgement tell her

Suh dem cyaa stop mi shine
Because mi star dem keep winking
Put a joy pon yo face dash weh the wrinkling
Keep the joy, hold the faith
That a the in thing
Unity suh that haffi in a the king thing
Chic-kun-gunya fi the athlete dem limping
Fi cut dem speed anytime dem sprinting
Ebola fi kill the people what a sinting
Dem waan control yo mind, know how you thinking

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Mi seh a the function a the heart
Well mi seh you haffi store love
Right yah now meck mi tell dem seh a sure love
A nuh 1, and a nuh 3 and a nuh 4 love
King Shango tell dem more and more love
Mi nuh care if a rich or a poor love
Meck sure seh yo safe and secure love
As long as a clean and a pure love
Nothing cyaa go before love

[Chorus]
