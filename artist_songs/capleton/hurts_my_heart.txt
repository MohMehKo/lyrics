It hurts my heart
Got to share my thoughts
It hurts my heart
They won't walk the righteous path

When me go so almshouse an' me no want that 'bout
Dem go walk bout a run up dem mouth
After me lef from Jamaica go a foreign pon tour
When me come back dem turn big time sell out
When me did say woman me, lotion me, no lotion man
That dismantle dem boogeying plan

Then me go say music is a mission not a competition
Nuff a dem run go turn carbon
Then me say the heathen dem a rage
Ask dem how long and tell dem hold a meditation

Well, I say it hurt my heart, heart
And I got to share my thought, thought, thought
Judgment

When me tell dem watch how dem flex and how dem program
Dem put on the wings of the morning and fly
When me say don't try to trick I you little Satan spy
Dem build coffin and prepare fi die

Tell dem no dis the trinity and dem can't sleep a night
Dem get the treat and no take the warning
Then me go say wake up in the glorious morning
I man see Babylon but your kingdom is falling
Then me juggle again and sing

Well, I say it hurt my heart, heart
And I got to share my thought, thought, thought
Judgment

When me get the new talk fi spread
Babylon think me dead
Who seek a live and I say who talk dead
Fire red

Cold cold cold cold blooded murderer
Oonu fi look out
Live clean so that your works can be seen
Me bawl why why mankind dem so cuvitch

Well, I say it hurt my heart, heart
And I got to share my thought, thought, thought
Judgment

Well me say dem hard fi believe
And me see it from afar
Dem no like me and me no like dem
When me go?

While the sun shine
Nuff a dem still come get bad mind
Then me go say war upon the leader dem mind
But a long time?

And again well, oh, Dem a gwaan like dem good so
And again.. oh Dem a gwaan like dem a bad so
Then me have fi light up mi callie so go burn down Rome
Then chant burn down Sodom
Babylon know me make me want chant me song
Well a long time we warn dem and dem neva want listen

Well, I say it hurt my heart, heart
And I got to share my thought, thought, thought
Judgment

It hurts my heart
Got to share my thoughts
It hurts my heart
