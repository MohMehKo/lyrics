Would you let them break us apart
Would you let them
Would you let them break our hearts
Would you let them

Would you let them break us apart
Would you let them
Would you let them break our hearts
Would you let them

Together they can't break us we are strong
Divide us on the road leads to distruction
Don't you fall a pray to Babylon
They want to pull us all in different directions
So they take you from the roots and teach you their own truth
Open up your mind please don't you be so blind
I'm not in it for the fame, I'm in it for the love
When it's all said and done, we're more than blood.

Would you let them break us apart
Would you let them
Would you let them break our hearts
Would you let them

Would you let them break us apart
Would you let them
Would you let them break our hearts
Would you let them

But wi nah go tek dem lesson, nah go sit down inna dem class
Pon di road of corruption, ghetto youth wi nah go walk
Jah bless I every step pon di rocky road wi march
Always have love inna wi heart
But I see it Jah now dis mi positive and sure of
Everyday di rich a get rich and di poor a get poorer
Unite the people in and from the diaspora
No corruption cant come through da door ya
And say again.

Don't you loose your way
Material couldn't make I dread
We have love and happiness
So we'll be alright

Would you let them break us apart
Would you let them
Would you let them break our hearts
Would you let them

Would you let them break us apart
Would you let them
Would you let them break our hearts
Would you let them

Together they can't break us we are strong
Divide us on the road leads to destruction
Don't you fall a pray to Babylon
They want to pull us all in different directions
So they take you from the roots and teach you their own truth
Open up your mind please don't you be so blind
I'm not in it for the fame, I'm in it for the love
When it's all said and done, we're more than blood.
