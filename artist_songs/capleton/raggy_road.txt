Jah Rastafari, and I saw an I-angel ascended from the east
Having the seal of the living King, Emperor Haile Selassie I
The Most High and He cried out with a loud voice, sayin'

Oh, oh, it's a raggy road, road is so rough
Raggy road, road is so tough
Raggy road, a road is so rough
Raggy road

Well, I been troddin' this road for the longest while
And me career nuff a dem want fi soil
Troddin' this road for the longest while
And never yet try profit off all another man toil

Troddin' this road for the longest while
A long time in this house and me no stop till the soil
Troddin' this road for the longest while
And give away more than one tenth of the spoil

Troddin' this road for the longest while
And still me lamp never run outa oil

This the one you have fi feel
Tell dem a no bargain, tell dem a no deal
Nuff a dem nah want put dem shoulder to the wheel
So dem go rape, dem go rob and dem go kill and steal

All a try eat all a another man meal
Onu deaf, onu dumb, onu blind fi go feel
One man was worthy to open the seal
Emperor Selassie I, I know is real
Babylon get trampled under me heel

Raggy road, road is so rough
Raggy road, road is so tough
Raggy road, road is so rough
Raggy road

Well, I been troddin' this road for the longest while
And me career nuff a dem want fi soil
Troddin' this road for the longest while
And never yet try profit off all another man toil

Troddin' this road for the longest while
A long time in this house and me no stop till the soil
Troddin' this road for the longest while
And give away more than one tenth of the spoil

Troddin' this road for the longest while
And still my lamp never run outta oil

Well, nuff a dem go get throw overboard
Like Henry Morgan with the pirate code
Nuff a dem a trod upon corruption road
Nuff a dem a trod with Satan heavy load

True dem promote that dem and [?]
The bingi man no [?], bingi man no pose
Bingi man no wear up dem Babylon clothes
In a me turban and me Asian robe

Well, dem a come see, we come fi expose
The righteous works nuff try oppose
I see judgment a take dem evil at the sword
Judgment take dem and then dem explode

Well, it's a raggy road, road is so rough
Raggy road, road is so tough
Raggy road, a road is so rough
Raggy road

Immanuel road so rough
Raggy road
Selassie I road so tough
Raggy road
[?] so rough
Raggy road

Well, Babylon dem have fi run
Now dem see the hour and how come dem a go run
I'm like the lightning and the thunder
Come fi conquer dem gun

I'm like the rain, I'm like the breeze
I'm like the river that run
I'm like the star, I'm like the moon
I'm just like the sun

And dem give the ghetto youth dem gun
Fi shoot dem brother down
Babylon you judgment a fi come

Raggy road, road is so rough
Raggy road, road is so tough
Raggy road, a road is so rough
Raggy road
