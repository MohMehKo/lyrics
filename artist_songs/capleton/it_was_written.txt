[Chorus x2:]
And it was written
Up in the book of life
That man shall
Endure forever more

Well did the pen is stronger than the knife
They can kill you once but they can't kill you twice
Did you know destruction of the flesh is not di ending to life
Fear not of the anti-Christ
Did you know that I exist before the Earth
An did you know that my eyes are windows to the world
Did you know you can't go ah Zion and wear Jerry curls
Can't tell di boys from di girls
Your body is just a vehicle transporting you soul
It's what's inside of people is beauty to behold
Fear not of evil
Every day dem flesh it grow old
Changes of the times take a toll

[Chorus]

Fear is in the eye of the beholder
Love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer
Fear is in the eye of the beholder
Love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer

A vester on his chest
And Rastafari is his name
A gift of everlasting life for all us to sustain
Blessing that you all be got
Lessons taught you all forgot
Rasta call I shit you not
Do you remember Elijah and his chariot of flames
Same blood dat run through my veins

Fear is in the eye of the beholder
Love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer
Fear is in the eye of the beholder
Love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer
Careful how you entertain stranger
Selassie never born in a manger
And never crucified as a savior
And likkle himself from all di ruler
Babylon na function with a failer
So be careful of them cellular and pager
'Cause as I see them I see danger
So dem great but Selassie ah greater, yo

[Chorus]

That man shall endure forever more
And it was written up in the book of life
That man shall endure forever more

Mi think mi wan lick upon shots upon a blood clot
And fill the block with bummer as cops
Cops mi nah talk mi know you watch me walks and
While black woman is getting raped across New York and
Before little brothers and chalks and
Imagine somebody say "That's your son dead" and
See us
We do the crime, we do the time
You get away scott free
So the police they gon' pop you for they pop me
'Cause if you get me, you got me, you shot me, no lock me
Carry shotty's since mom slapped me 'cause mi room sloppy
The youngest nigga out the camp, it's me
But nobody pampered me
So you better don't ran with me, for semi
Mi a player plenty
Chicks mi blaze many
Raise plenty a few dollars
Storm out mi Prada
Watch a bum holla
Watch em run, hit the floor
Told em come, come
No
Throw your guns up pon di air
Blow!

[Chorus]

Watch for sticks and stones
Stumbling blocks in piles
Life is one big road
Miles on top of miles
So blessed be the soul that always remains a child
When most people don't even smile
There's a natural mystic
Blow through the air
So keep in realistic and always be aware
The truth is crying out and it's so loud and so clear
But most people won't even hear
Spiritual pollution is in the atmosphere
And with so much confusion
Can one be happy here
The gift of Rastafari is for all man to share
But some would rather to be so unfair

[Chorus]
