[Intro:]
Dem waan know how wi survive out a road
And dem waan know how wi suh wise out a road
And dem waan know how wi arrive out a road
And dem waan know, wi naw compromise out a road

Dem waan know how wi suh wise out a road
And dem waan know how wi a strive out a road
And dem waan know how wi realize out a road
Dem waan know, wi naw compromise out a road

[Chorus:]
Nothing weh dem try, nothing weh dem try
None a dem cyaa escape rastafari

Nothing weh dem try, nothing weh dem try
Dem could a put on the wing a the morning and fly

Nothing weh dem try, nothing weh dem try
Mi naw sell mi soul nuh matter how dem a buy
Nothing weh dem try, nothing weh dem try
Dem left unity, strength, why dem naw unify

[Verse 1:]
Nuff go try magny and cyaa magnify
Nuff go try digny and cyaa dignify
Nuff go try santy and cyaa santify
Nuff go try glory and cyaa glorify
Nuff have testimony and cyaa testify
Nuff go try song till dem end up songfy
Nuff go try psy, till dem end up psyfie
Nuff go try bonie but dem never bony fie

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Nuff a use dem head but dem naw edify
Fire get red true dem naw medi high
Nuff go try clarity and naw clarify
Charity, solidarity dem naw multiply
Nuff go try justice and naw justify
Humility, Simplicity, dem naw simplify
Rastafari, Selasie High is the most high

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Nuff go try henny, and some go try rum
Some go try teeth, and some go try tongue
Some go try 3, and some go try sum
Some go try cherry, and some go try plum
Nuff go try cheese, and nuff go try bun
Nuff go try dagger, and nuff go try con
Nuff go waan fi walk, and mi seh nuff a dem go waan fi run
But none shall escape when the judgement come

[Chorus x2]
