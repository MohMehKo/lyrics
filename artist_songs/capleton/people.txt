[Chorus:]
Ghetto youth when yo wire the battlefield
Don't left yo weapon and yo shield
Who cyaa hear dem a go feel
And wi no fraid a people

Ghetto youth when yo wire the battlefield
Don't left yo weapon and yo shield
Know who fake from who real
Caw wi no fraid a people

[Verse 1:]
Cyaa come a battlefield if yuh a Prentice
Supn weh pull out yo teeth like dentist
So mi find out seh nuff a dem a ensis
Seh dem a badman mi ask dem when since
So mi find out dem bwoy yah a try a hit
Him meck a drive by and then him get him tire split
How mi no listen weh dem a chat wid dem lire lip
The eagle fly dung and him wind get a fire clip

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Yo could a bad like a Steve Austin
Like Goliath could a big and trapting
Ready fi go dash in a the trash bin
Meck wi show dem how wi deal wid napkin
How dem seh dem cold and dem no know bout napkin
A tell man bout dem wi meck gunshot sing
Mi no in a the trace nor lash thing
Dem bwoy deh just a chat, chat, chat

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Cyaa frighten mi, cyaa frighten mi
And dem cyaa send vampire wid no bite fi mi
Oily Selassie a him shine the light fi mi
In a the dark, or in a the day, or in a the night fi mi
When dem a do road tell dem a sky si mi
And mi unlimited dem cyaa stifle mi
And dem cyaa send no sniper fi come rifle mi
A good over evil

[Chorus]
