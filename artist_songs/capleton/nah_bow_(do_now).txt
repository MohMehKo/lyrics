How can I put dem on my mind
When I know their own truth they will have to find?

How can I put them on my mind when dem never see
When Jah, Jah show dem the sign when nuff a fight fi position?

All dat encourage I said is division
With dem politricks and dem old religion
All it create is just war and bare friction
Well, bingi man deh yah fi make a decision

Can't make dem distract we from Jah, Jah mission
Dem a worry 'bout we sight ask 'bout we vision
Dem want know weh certain things it derive from
From the injustice and the manipulation

Death without dignity and exploitation
Disregarded not regarded of dem illusion
Dem get the dream but a we get the vision
Jah inspire man with the perseverance
Vision and the will fi burn down Babylon
Nya man gwaan chant mi song

Well, go tell dem, ras a no style nor trend
Go tell dem, ras a the high testament

Only the righteous man observe dem

Straighten your crooked ways if you know seh dem bend
Unbelievable crime nuff commit yah mi frien'
True a infatuation motivate dem
Nuff a dem go bow down to ornament

True dem no have a clean heart nor a clear conscience
And dem no render dem heart dem go render garments
Dem no stop from oppose, no stop from offend

Till dem become vampire and pestilence
Till dem drinking the blood of dem children
So dem destined to a long age of punishment
Go tell dem, dem make the wrong commitment

'Cause on dem roll call, nuff nah go present
Nuff name nah go call that mean dem absent
While the rastaman still a chant him reverence
Emperor Selassie I is omnipotent well again

Well, refrain from the negativity that we believe
I have to achieve what I have to achieve
For my sisters and my brothers the youths dem need
True nuff can't suppress resist anger and greed

Well, dem become liars and become thieves
Jah, Jah all a warn dem and dem still nah take heed
So dem become deserter, no stop from deceive
The blood of corruption dem surely shall bleed

Nuff a dem heart whe the bingi man a read
And get to over stand seh nuff a dem a bad seed
Dem fell amongst the stone and the thorn and get squeeze
So nya man go rout out the bad weed

We nah eat dem goat an cow then again

When I know their own truth?
