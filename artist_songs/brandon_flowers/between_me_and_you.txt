Between me and you, I've been thinking about the future and
Between me and you, I think I'm losing it now
Between me and you, I've been worried about the future and
Between me and you, I think I'm losing it now

And all my life, I've been told
Follow your dreams, but the trail went cold
And the heart don't lie and that's a good luck charm
But I'm watching it tear out of my arms

And there's a power in letting go
I guess I didn't want to let you know
These hours I'm working ain't nearly enough
And sometimes its like a bullet came and blasted me right of out of the blue

But I'm doing my best to not let it get 
Between me and you

Between me and you
(Come on child)
I've been struggling just to carry the weight
(Get up child)
Between me and you
(Come on child)
I think I'm losing it now
(You got to fly)

The first time that I saw your face
Time stood still
I found my place
Now I'm watching it tear right out of my arms

And there's a power in letting go
I guess I didn't want to let you know
These hours I'm working ain't nearly enough
Just chasing every dollar, girl 
Is this what I was born to do?

But I'm doing my best not to let it get 
Between me and you

I remember you in white in the garden
Its been trial after trial
Through the ringer in the back
Out the window, off this track
I was just too proud to know
(Come on child)
There's a power in letting go
I never thought it'd be so hard

These hours I'm working ain't nearly enough
And sometimes its like a bullet came and blasted me right of out of the blue
And I feel like I've got nothing to show
For this life and I've been wondering what am I suppose to do
And I'm doing my best not to let it get
And I'm doing my best not to let it get
Between me and you
