When the lights go down in the city, getting real low
Settling in my room, I'm unnoticed
When the still comes in through my window, letting me go
I feel a calm, come over me, on the floor

On the floor
Where the rats all come away clean
There on the floor
Where the children all stomped and screamed straight out the door
Well I find myself on my knees
Begging please

When the lights go down in the city and everyone goes, to their room
Walking the trail to dreamland
When the lights go down in the city, something is roaring
I find myself waiting to believe

On the floor
Where the mice call shots in the corner that's where I'll be
When the crickets come home and sing their symphony
Well I find myself on my knees
Begging please

On the floor
Facing the things I've done here on the floor
Where the years have gathered and run that's where I'll be
And I find myself on my knees
Begging please
