She was raised a Protestant
I was raised by wolves
Both of us saw dignity in vain
The stretching out in paradise
It wasn’t in the cards
See, neither of us were ready for the rain

Guess I was caught off-guard
When I heard the news last week
Ran into a friend of mine
With the word on the street

That the life that you chose to lead
Had the desired effect
That you hit the ground running
The day that you left
That you’re playing for every side
That you’re going for every kill
But I don’t believe it
And I never will
Never will

Lately, it’s all dogs and bones
Chasing every tail
And howling at the injustice of the night
And if I misjudged you
Well, honey, that’s on me
But I really do hope you found a way
To get what you need

And the life that you chose to lead
Had the desired effect
That you hit the ground running
The day that you left
That you’re playing for every side
That you’re going for every kill
Well, I don’t believe it
And I never will

Are you wondering where it all goes?
Are you living the way you should?
Are you taking the time to listen?
Is it doing you any good?
Are you wresting with the demons?
Are you moving the party forward
In your time?

Are you looking to change the world?
Or have you already changed your mind?
Are you keeping the Ten Commandments
Or are you leaving ‘em all behind?
Are you practicing your pirouettes?
Or are you going in the line this time?

’Til the life that you chose to lead
Had the desired effect
Did you hit the ground running
The day that you left?
Are you playing for every side?
Are you going for every kill?
Well, I don’t believe it
And I never will

The desired effect
