Between me and you
I've been thinking about the future and
Between me and you
I think I'm losing it now

Between me and you
I've been worried about the future and
And all my life, I've been told
Follow your dreams but the trail went cold
And the heart don't lie
And that's a good luck charm
But I'm watching it tear out of my arms

And there's a power in letting go
I guess I didn't want to let you know
These hours I'm working ain't nearly enough
And sometimes it's like a bullet came and blasted me right of out of the blue
But I'm doing my best to not let it get between me and you
Between me and you
(Come on child)
I've been struggling just to carry the weight
(Get up child)
Between me and you
(Come on child)
I think I'm losing it now

The first time that I saw your face
Time stood still
I found my place
Now I'm watching it tear right out of my arms

And there's a power in letting go
I guess I didn't want to let you know
These hours I'm working ain't nearly enough
And sometimes it's like a bullet came and blasted me right out of the blue
But I'm doing my best not to let it get between me and you

I remember you in white in the garden
It's been trial after trial
Through the ringer in the back
Out the window, off the track
I was just too proud to know

These hours I'm working ain't nearly enough
And sometimes it's like a bullet came and blasted me right out of the blue
But I'm doing my best not to let it get 
And I'm doing my best not to let it get
And I'm doing my best not to let it get
Between me and you
