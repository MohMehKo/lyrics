The highway was teasing me with promises and visions 
Of a country unseen in a black limousine
For the better part of my twenties on the corner of this dirty street
A decade in the making, just a loser on two tender feet singing

Dreams come true
Dreams come true
Dreams come true
Dreams come true

She wasn't having anything, no birds or any bees
Girl, don't go shooting all the dogs down just 'cause one's got fleas
I'll bite what turns you sour baby, I've got miles per hour lady
Make up your mind, you never know what you might find

When dreams come true
Dreams come true
Yes they do
Dreams come true
Dreams come true
Dreams come true
Yes they do
Dreams come true

Punch the clock, baby on the nightstand
You close your eyes, waiting for the Sandman
Spend your life, bracing for the crash land
You forget, baby it's a dreamland
Baby it's a dreamland

A natural believer, I don't carry any bones
If you see things a little different, I'm not casting any stones
Been taking it for granted, got the right to speak my mind
I'll overcome the dark, just like the dead, the lame, the leper, and the blind man
Like Lazarus, or the mother of Peter's wife

Punch the clock, baby on the nightstand
You close your eyes, waiting for the Sandman
Spend your life, bracing for the crash land
You forget, baby it's a dreamland
Take a chance underneath the streetlight
Touch my heart, and everything is alright

I don't waste my time
On where do I park the car
I don't stand in line
And it's treated me, alright so far

If dreams come true
I get to drink the cup
But one fine day
I'm gonna find a better way
(Gonna have a lot to say)

Punch the clock, baby on the nightstand
You close your eyes, waiting for the Sandman
Spend your life, bracing for the crash land
You forget, baby it's a dreamland
Take a chance, underneath the streetlight
Touch my heart, everything is alright

In the blackness of the night
Everything is alright
