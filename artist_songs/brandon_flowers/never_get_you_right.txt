It's a coin toss, it's a game on
You were born lost, and dirt blonde
No curfew, with a drunk mom
No one to stop you now

And I'll give you my opinion, it's the only one I've got
They'll turn you into something, whether you are it or not

But they'll never get you right
I've been watching you all night
And the people passing by
Should tremble at your sight

All these bad dreams, and backseats
High beams, through the dark streets
A good angel with bad wings
No one to help you out

And I'll give you my opinion, it's the only one I've got
They'll turn you into something, whether you are it or not
Through a microscope lens, dissecting your whole life

[x2:]
But they'll never get you right
I've been watching you all night
And the people passing by
Should tremble at your sight

But they'll never get you right

Everybody talks from the wrong side of the mask
Gliding through the universe as the world goes rolling past
But don't give in to the pressure 'cause it isn't gonna stop
The world goes on around you whether you like it or not

But they'll never get you right
I've been watching you all night
And the people passing by
Should tremble at your sight
But they'll never get you right

Get you right, well they re never gonna get you right [x3]
