Hah Hah Hah Hah Hah Hah
Is there anyone out there?
Somewhere I can belong
Man the city just ain't so kind tonight

I need a place to take refuge
See I been loving you blind
And I guess that made it hard for me to find

That we were caught up in the middle of a worn out dream
I knew we were in trouble but baby I almost screamed
When I saw you dancing
On the moon now
I watched him spin you round and round
Why did you roll your dice, show your cards?
Jilted lovers and broken hearts
You're flying away, while I'm stuck here on the ground

Is there anyone out there?
Somewhere I can belong
Man the city just ain't so kind,tonight

And if I had my suspicions
I kept them out of my heart
Just wished I would of known right from the start

That you'd be speaking in riddles and you'd never confide
You know I knew we were in trouble, but honey I almost cried
When I saw you dancing
On the moon now
I watched him spin you round and round
Why did you roll your dice, show your cards?
Jilted lovers and broken hearts
You're out on the wind and I'm still waiting to be found.

You did a fine job of hiding
That crooked ace up your sleeve
You doubled down my direction
You kiss me on the cheek and leave
I followed you through the darkness
I followed you through the cold
Woman I can tell you one thing
You're gonna wish you could go back and fold

Why did you roll your dice, show your cards?
Jilted lovers and broken hearts
You're flying away, while I'm stuck here on the ground

Why did you roll your dice, show your cards?
Jilted lovers and broken hearts
You're out on the wind and I'm still waiting to be found.

Yeah! Will I ever win?
Only time will tell
You got to suffer to remember how well
That are our ideals never really marched in time
That's the bottom line
Jilted lovers and broken hearts
