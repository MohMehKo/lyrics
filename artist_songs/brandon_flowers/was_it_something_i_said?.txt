Me and Valentina went down to the chapel but the gates were shut
I had my vows in my pocket and a gold plated ring for my honey love
We headed down Tropicana to the corner with the late night restaurant
We sat across from each other, when I looked in her eyes there was something gone

Was it something that I said or did?
Was it something that I should have kept hidden?
If you leave me hanging I don’t know what I’ll do
It doesn’t matter who’s wrong or right
In the clear of the blue moonlight
You got me on my knees, Valentina, this is not like you

I got a job at the Nugget and I saved a thousand dollars for a brand new start
She said “I didn’t want to do it, but I did it cause I didn’t want to break your heart”
The waiter whispered when he said we had to take the conversation to the parking lot
Please baby, please, Valentina, baby, you’re the only thing I got

Was it something that I said or did?
Was it something that I should have kept hidden?
If you leave me hanging I don’t know what I’ll do
It doesn’t matter who’s wrong or right
In the clear of the blue moonlight
You got me on my knees, Valentina, this is not like you

I hear church bells ringing in my head and I take ‘em everywhere I go
Valentina met a dealer and I heard they had a baby five months ago

Was it something that I said or did?
Was it something that I should have kept hidden?
If you leave me hanging I don’t know what I’ll do
It doesn’t matter who’s wrong or right
In the clear of the blue moonlight
You got me on my knees, Valentina, don’t say it’s true
This is not like you
