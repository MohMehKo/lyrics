With every beautiful new sight
I see that perfect golden light
Against your eyes
Tried to hold it up
Try to live it up
Seal it with your touch
Everything at once

You only get what you put into this life
So how could anybody be living in a bad dream

[Chorus:]
Ooh, when you got this open road
And the sun is shining
How could anybody be living in a bad dream
Oooh, with the top down drivin slow
All the love that 
I know
How could anybody be living in a bad dream

Last night my dreams were on TV
I stepped away to watch the world play out in front of me
Sorrow in your eyes isn't a real life
Its good enough for me, good enough for tonight

You only get what you put into this life
So how could anybody be living in a bad dream

[Chorus]

Dream
Dream
Dream

Dream, Dream, Dream
Dream, Dream, Dream
Dream, Dream, Dream

[Chorus]

Dream, Dream, Dream
Dream, Dream, Dream
Dream, Dream, Dream
