Oh well Hi, Hey there, Hello.
Have you got some place to go?
I’ve got some time and I would love to take you out.
I’ve got two nickels to my name.
Well hey, my story sounds the same but I’ll find some way to show you what life’s all about.
Oh we could take a walk downtown.
No, lets search for higher ground.
We’ll count the stars, and clouds and howl at the moon.
I hear the rich folks come here too, cause’ it’s such a lovely view and when the sun decides to rise it’ll be too soon.
Oooh.
Oh my blood may run red but the thoughts in my head, they are blue. They are purple. They are gold.
And though there may come a day where my hair it turns grey, but my soul, oh, my soul, will never grow old.
See I’m not skin and bones. 
I am sunshine and snow on this ever‐changing earth that we know.
I’ll melt into a stream. I will glisten and gleam.
I’ll float on but I’ll never grow old.
I’ll float on but I’ll never grow old.
Oooh.
