Maybe no one
Is the right one
I'm just tired
And looking for one
Of these strangers
Cause its better than being alone
Its gettin' later
And I'm thinkin'
I guess I might as
Well settle for one of these strangers
Cause its better than being alone

This ain't no bad thing
If you keep comin' around
Things could get messy
I don't care cause I know this ain't the real thing baby...
Lonely lately
So what do we got to lose?

Maybe anyone is the right one
I'm just wired
Wanna have fun with one of you strangers
Cause I'm tired of being alone
Maybe being on my own ain't such a bad thing
And I start to realize that what you're doing to me
Is better being alone

This ain't no bad thing
First glance you had me
