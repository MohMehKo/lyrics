Lately I've been so lonely
Don't know why, but I think that it's cause of you
It's true
I chase the time. I remember the old days
I pretend that I can still be who I am and not be excommunicated
(By society that is)
I told you twice, I love you. I still do
Time don't lie, he says that Love it ain't easy
The road is long and arduous

But oh, I think you know why we came here and what we are fighting for
Ooh oh oh oh oh oh

Sometimes I go a wanderin'
It seems like I always get stuck in my head
I become the hermit
Waiting for the dawn to come now
Waiting for the light to get me high and guide me home
Ooh oh oh

Singing Oh, I think you know why we came here and what we are fighting for
Ooh oh oh oh oh oh

Lately I'm not so lonely
I know why. I think that it's cause of you
It's true
