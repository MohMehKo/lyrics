Well, you can find me on a good day laughing 'til the sun comes up
Another California summer, whiskey in a plastic cup
But everybody is an actor, be hide to give it up
And now they're working at the bars making drinks for kids like us

Can you save me on your old man's porch, she's talking me up
Don't know what to say I really doubt my fall, I don't know enough
Now I've been waiting, but I'm so caught up in my own fuss
I need to relate it but I feel so distant from everyone

We've been waiting our whole lives
Carried away with the hard times
I don't wanna wait for something right,
Gotta get out, get out tonight
We're all waiting for the sunlight

I've been hanging out of my head, instead of getting wasted
And I've got more trouble about than I can taste it
Oh, look at the state I'm in, why am I complaining?
I should be taking all this wisdom, giving it to everyone,
Every daughter, every son

We've been waiting our whole lives
Carried away with the hard times
I don't wanna wait for something right,
Gotta get out, get out tonight
We're all waiting for the sunlight (for the sunlight)

We've been waiting our whole lives
Carried away with the hard times
I don't wanna wait for something right,
Gotta get out, get out tonight
We're all waiting for the sunlight
We're all waiting for the sunlight
Don't wanna wait for something right,
Gotta get out, get out tonight
We're all waiting for the sunlight

You can find me on a good day laughing 'til the sun comes up
