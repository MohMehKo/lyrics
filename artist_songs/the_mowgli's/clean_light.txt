Sometimes I think away these days
The way I spend them hiding 
Sometimes I can't lift up my head
Maybe you can find me.
All you need to know,
Look for a light that's shining
All we see now
We see a fire starting.
I swear I dream of waking up
To find the future screaming
But I've been sleepwalking so much
I don't remember dreaming 
All we need to know
Look for a light that's shining 
All we see now
We see a fire starting
We all look bright here 
Underneath the sun
the same clean light, in the same love
We'll all be here if the end is coming up
the same clean light, in the same love
So when you crawl into your head
What do you think you're missing?
I will lift you up again
I will always listen. 
All we need to know
Look for a light that's shining
All we see now 
We see a fire starting. 
We all look bright here underneath the sun
The same clean light, in the same love
We'll all be here if the end is coming up
The same clean light in the same love.
I hope you know that love is good enough,
What doesn't change will slip and fall away.
I hope you know you're loved
And that's enough
What doesn't change, 
Doesn't matter anyway. 
We are underneath the sun in the same love.
