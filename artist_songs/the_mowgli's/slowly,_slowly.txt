Slowly, slowly
we become the secrets that we keep.
Yea, it’s only you.
It’s only me.
It’s only love and it’s only fair
that you find your peace.
Yea, it’s only you.
It’s only me.
It’s only love and it’s only fair
that you find your peace.
My head 
my spirit’s end,
could do this whole damn world right in.
And I’ll turn green 
like lover’s greed
and you’ll get high
off of loving me
and then you’ll finally see.
I hope you finally see..
That it’s only you.
It’s only me.
It’s only love
as far as distance allows me.
Yea it’s only you.
It’s only me.
Lonely love
as long as I can hear you sing.
And now I’m hearing you sing.

Ooooh. 
Slowly, Slowly (slowly, slowly we) 
Slowly, slowly (slowly, slowly we) 
Slowly, slowly (slowly, slowly we) 
Slowly, slowly  
 we become the secrets that we keep 
yeah it's only you it's only me 
it's only love and it's only fair that you FIND YOUR PEACE
