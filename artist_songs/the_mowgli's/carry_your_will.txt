Hmm

Cherish this cause when it doesn 't last
you'll wish you had
I will cherish this
I will be humble again

What will it take to get me to get where I'm going?
Do you know the way?
Do you know when the tunnel ends
Lord, have mercy on me

Hmm

I see a house of lies
built upon a foundation of sand
That was our house
That was our life, but we fell in

Then it was dark
and we could see no more
But some how we found each other
Some how we found hope

If you carry your will, I will carry my will
If you carry your will, I will carry my will
If you carry your will, I will carry my will
If you carry your will, I will carry my will

Let your faith guide your faith [20x]

If you carry your will, I will carry my will
If you carry your will, I will carry my will
If you carry your will, I will carry my will
If you carry your will, I will carry my will

Let your faith guide your fate [3x]

Cherish this cause when it doesn't last, you'll wish you had
