Something is bothering me
Taking it out on you
I try to throw it away
But it never let me loose
And now I'm drip dry, tongue tied
But that's another story
I just wanna get through the day
Just gotta get me away

In another life I could find a way
I could fall in love
In another time, on another day
I would give it up

I don't know what to do with myself
All alone in my head
I'm stuck in a spiderweb
what to do with myself
All alone in my head
I'm stuck in a spiderweb

Now I surrender to THE
Don't know what it's gonna be
Something is bothering me
I'm questioning all I believe
Every time I ask you why
You try to buy me with the same old story
You just gotta look for your faith
Just gotta look for your strength

In another life I could find a way
I could fall in love
In another time, on another day
I would give it up

I don't know what to do with myself
All alone in my head
I'm stuck in a spiderweb
what to do with myself
All alone in my head
I'm stuck in a spiderweb
I'm stuck in a spiderweb

Don't know what to do with myself
All alone in my head
I'm stuck in a spiderweb

Don't know what to do with myself
All alone in my head
I'm stuck in a spiderweb
what to do with myself
All alone in my head
I'm stuck in a spiderweb
I'm stuck in a spiderweb
I'm stuck in a spiderweb
I'm stuck in a spiderweb
