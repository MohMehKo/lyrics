Making something out of nothing
Flip your hair and space out
Searching for a way out
Convince yourself to stay out
We speak a different language 
Acting like we're famous
Invisible like everybody is

I was busy looking for forever in you
While you were looking for somebody new

Spacin out
On the words coming out of your mouth
Spacin out
And out and out

Feelin everything and nothing 
So in love that it's disgusting
It's fine cause I can feel
Strung out
On the way it never works out
All disneyfied and played out
Your love is like a bloodhound
I'll track ya down

I was busy looking for forever in you
While you were looking for something you already knew
You got me spacin out

Spacin out
On the words coming out of your mouth
Spacin out
And out and out

Spacin out
On the words coming out of your mouth
Spacin out

You got me spacin out
You got me spacin out
You got me spacin out

Spacin out
On the words coming out of your mouth
Spacin out

Spacin out
On the words coming out of your mouth
Spacin out
