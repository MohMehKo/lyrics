I caught you right before you closed your eyes
You asked me if I'd been here all your life
There's this person down inside of me
The man I'm scared I'll never be, no
He sits and watches patiently
And sends me all the signs I need the most
I don't mind, I feel that I'm waiting for the right time
I know why I'm here
I've been waiting for a lifetime
Just trying to find some peace
Somewhere inside of me
Just let me know what it is I need
Emily
We went down to the cinema last night
Let the pictures show us who we are inside
You smiled at the truth you'd seen
It's the same truth that's inside of me, oh
And I smiled at the truth I knew
It's the same truth that's inside of you, oh
I don't mind, I feel that I'm waiting for the right time
I know why I'm here, I've been waiting for a lifetime
Just trying to find some peace
Somewhere inside of me
Just let me know what it is I need
Emily
