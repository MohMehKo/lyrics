I’ve been in love with love
And the idea of something, binding us together
You know that love is strong enough,
I’ve seen time tell tales about that systematic drug,
Yeah that heart that beats as one
It’s collectively
Unconsciously composed

I lost my head in San Francisco,
Waiting for the fog to roll out
But I found it in a rain cloud
It. Was. Smiling. Down.
Do you feel the love? I feel the love
C’mon c’mon, lets start it up!
Let it pour out of your soullllllll
