Sometimes your good ain't good enough
Sometimes your try ain't hard enough
I get real caught up in my head
Get real caught up
Hiding away under covers
Wasting away in the suburbs 
Everyone says they're gonna leave
Everyone says it

Hey, are you still awake?
I'm starting to feel like I'm running in place
Hey, it's freakin' me out
Freakin' me out now

Sometimes your love is so infinite 
Everything else just seems ridiculous
Get real caught up in my head
Get real caught up
Summer's watching us come home
It's always colder where we go
It's got me ripping off my clothes
When we get to the west coast 

Hey, are you still awake? 
I'm starting to feel like I'm running in place
Hey, are you okay?
Cause I feel like you've been all over the place

Hey, are you still awake? 
I'm starting to feel like I'm running in place
Hey, it's freakin' me out
Freakin' me out now

Oh gotta let it go 
Don't even gotta say it cause everyone knows
It's like everyone knows something I don't
I feel a little closer the further I go

La da da, gotta let it go
Everyone knows something I don't
And it's freakin' me out now

Well, are you still awake? 
Yeah, you okay?

Hey, are you still awake? 
I'm starting to feel like I'm running in place
Hey, are you okay?
Cause I feel like you've been all over the place

Hey, are you still awake? 
I'm starting to feel like I'm running in place
Hey, it's freakin' me out
Freakin' me out now

Oh gotta let it go 
Don't even gotta say it cause everyone knows
It's like everyone knows something I don't
I feel a little closer the further I go

La da da, gotta let it go
Everyone knows something I don't
Yeah it's freakin' me out
