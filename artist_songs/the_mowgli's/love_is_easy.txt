Did you ever think about the tingling in your hands? 
You get the feeling that the summer brings, and you know that you can't hide it. 
You can always sing it in a harmony. 
We're getting one step closer to the mysteries of the road that we will never know. 
Yeah we know that we will never know.

My head is crippled.
Heart it feels the pain.
Love is simple.
Love is easy.

You can try it in the morning try it out in the rain 
but your love won't change one single thing and you know that you can't hide it.
If you try it and it didn't quite fall into place 
then your love may not have been right for the day but you know that you've got to move on. 
Yeah you know that your heart will move on.

Anything you want it will be right at your door when your eyes look above you get up.
Anything you need will be right at your feet if you try you can reach everyone.

Love is simple.
Love is easy.
