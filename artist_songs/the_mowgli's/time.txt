I don’t like time, time is making me old 
but I’m doing alright cause I will still be young tomorrow 
and I can’t stand working all day work is wearing out my soul 
I think I’ll go out tonight and I will call in sick tomorrow 
I get so down about this world sometimes 
I cannot understand people, no not at all 
but, I hope to see a change in man 
I hope to see us love one another and I know we can 
My bank account is runnin’ out 
I’m paying fees for overdrafts but when I win the lottery 
I’ll tell BofA that they can kiss my ass 
cause I don’t like time, time’s ticking away my life 
So I live the way I want to live and I will live this way till I am dead 
When life gets hard you’ve got remember who you are 
and forget about what people think 
just be who you want to be 
Don’t you want to see how good life can be? 
lets make a harmony and life will sing 
and I wait for you to come home 
I haven’t seen you in so long I don’t remember what you look like 
So I will see you for the first time 
I’ve been dreaming of the open road 
I’ve got this feeling like I won’t be coming home anytime soon 
lets go around this world and make it new 
lets get lost, lets walk into the dark and forget about our sorrows 
we’ll learn to let go 
singin’ oh I know we can 
Don’t you want to see how good life can be? 
lets make a harmony and life will sing
