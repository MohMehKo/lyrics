You always come right on time when I've had that kind of night
And it ain't hard to take you home but that don't make it right
And you were different from your friends, 
You didn't live in magazines, 
You were crying all the time 
Wish I could make it right

But you've been hanging round these days more than I'd like

[Chorus:]
We fall in love in every dream
We shared a bed but couldn't sleep
We have some kind of love but that don't make it right
And all the silly little things that you said but you didn't mean 
We got real good love but that don't make it right
And you can say I'm wrong but that don't make it right

I'm just a little bit too late and you know I get that way and if I had a chance I swear id apologize
But you leave before I wake to wherever it is you go these days and thats fine but it still don't make it right

[Chorus x3]
