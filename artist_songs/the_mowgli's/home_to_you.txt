I bet these days he wonders my loves mean,
Stay out too late, come home shitfaced, can’t stop laughing about it
I bet these days she wishes she could kill me,
I never answer, doesn’t matter, can’t stop laughing about it

Too young to get it right, 
too young to make it serious tonight

Oh, I keep on coming home to you, 
can’t keep myself away from
You give me loving, that good kind of loving,
Oh, I keep on coming home to you

I remember times I would disappear all night
Stay up waiting, watching headlights, something don’t feel right
But it’s been a real long time, and I think we’re doing all right
And sometimes I still mess it up, and I can’t stop laughing about it
Too young to get it right, too young to make it serious tonight

Oh, I keep on coming home to you, 
can’t keep myself away from
You give me loving, that good kind of loving,
Oh, I keep on coming home to you

Everything you see is what I’ll never be,
And I’ll just keep trying to change your mind,
One day all my dreams’ll come running back to me,
I love the way you’re looking every night
But it means the world to me to see you smile

Oh, I keep on coming home to you, 
can’t keep myself away from
You give me loving, that good kind of loving,
Oh, I keep on coming home to you
