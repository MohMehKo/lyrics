We're getting close, for all that I know
But I take the most from things that I don't
And whether you're high or low, I'm breathing you in, like smoke
Yeah, I know I'm getting close to letting go

Losing sight of who you are, been growing worlds apart
Losing light, then something sparks
We're shining through the dark
Shining through the dark

It's coming to me, I feel everything
Yet we're not afraid, we'll never be
Cause whatever hurts the most, I'm breathing it out, like smoke
Yeah, I know I'm getting close to letting go

Losing sight of who you are, been growing worlds apart
Losing light, then something sparks
We're shining through the dark
We're shining through the dark
Shining through the dark

Everybody's gotta burn brighter
Everybody's gotta reach higher
Everybody's gotta find their way out
Everybody's gotta burn brighter
Everybody's gotta reach higher
Everybody's gotta find their way out

Losing sight of who you are, been growing worlds apart
Losing light, then something sparks
Losing sight of who you are, never gonna find it living in the dark
Losing light, then something sparks
We're shining through the dark
We're shining through the dark
Shining through the dark

Everybody's gotta burn brighter
Everybody's gotta reach higher
Everybody's gotta find their way out
Shining through the dark
