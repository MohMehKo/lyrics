I head east towards the city 
and when the sun goes down I’m heading home again 
the city lights have left me empty 
they’ve replaced the stars that used to shine so bright 
So I will smile and I’ll keep you close 
and when the sun brings in the morning 
I know today will be better than the last 
As I turn into the evening 
I pray my dreams will come and I’ll cross the great divide 
Don’t, don’t go changin’ 
please, please come and save me 
With your smile, you keep me close 
oh how you move me 
with your love, oh how it swept right through me 
and with your smile you bring heaven 
they say the west is home to reason 
so that’s where I’ve gone 
I’ve gone to meet my maker 
and when I find what I was made for 
this soul of mine will finally find some peace 
So I will smile and I’ll see you there
