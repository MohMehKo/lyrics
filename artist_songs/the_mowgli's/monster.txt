He keeps on waking up
Same old party still hungover
Too high to find real love
Says he'll get better when he's older

He asks me how I've been
But he ain't even listening
He's underneath my skin
And I am getting scared of him

And I know when I look at you
Those are someone else's eyes
And I know you can see me too
Only if you try

Sometimes I sit around and wonder
What made me turn into a monster
He's underneath my skin
I realize I'm just like him

And I know when I look at you
Those are someone else's eyes
And I know you can see me too
Only if you try

And I know when I look at you
Those are someone else's eyes
And I know you can see me too
Only if you try

Try to read between the lines
Can't get down if you're up every night

And I know when I look at you
Those are someone else's eyes
And I know you can see me too
Only if you try

And I know when I look at you
Those are someone else's eyes
And I know you can see me too
Only if you try

And I know when I look at you
Those are someone else's eyes
And I know you can see me too
Only if you try
Only if you try
Only if you try
