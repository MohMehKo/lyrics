I've tried a hundred time
Somewhere in the back of my mind
I knew I needed you and you needed me
And we see it through

We've been through everything
Seen things you can't believe
Now we can see the truth
And it's something that we can never lose

Something 'bout our love is automatic (is automatic)
Never really know until you've had it, it's automatic
Ooh-ooh-ooh ooh, it's automatic
Never really know 'til you've had it, it's automatic

I can't get enough, automatic love

Some people spend their whole lives
Looking for something that they won't find
You know I believe in you
You believe in me and we see it through

I feel like there's nobody around sometimes
Then I look at you and I realize
As long as you're around me know that I don't mind
(I don't mind)

Something 'bout our love is automatic (is automatic)
Never really know until you've had it, it's automatic
Ooh-ooh-ooh ooh, it's automatic
Never really know 'til you've had it, it's automatic

1, 2, 3  whoo!

Something 'bout our love is automatic (is automatic)
Never really know until you've had it, it's automatic
Ooh-ooh-ooh ooh, it's automatic
Never really know 'til you've had it, it's automatic
