I can feel it down low, low
Heart in my chest didn't know, no
Where did you come from and where did you go

Now I can see it's the real thing
Head is coming down from the ceiling
Waited so long for the morning

Did you get what you get what you came for?
Did you open up your mind, let go of your heart?
Did you get what you get what you came for?
Did you open up your mind, let go of your heart?

I never met somebody made me move like dancing
Release my fear, take another chance
I never will forget the feeling in my hands

I can feel it flowing through my fingertips
Send me to the moon everytime we kiss
I never knew that living life could be like this

Did you get what you get what you came for?
Did you open up your mind, let go of your heart?
Did you get what you get what you came for?
Did you open up your mind, let go of your heart?

Oh if we lose it all together
Maybe love will last forever
(Maybe love will last for...)
Oh if we lose it all together
Maybe love will last forever

One step closer to the mark and two jumps back 
when you missed it all together
Wishing love would last forever
Three times only makes a charm
And four eyes don't see any harm
But they never know if love would last forever
Maybe love will last forâ€¦

Did you get what you get what you came for?
Did you get what you get what you came for?
Did you get what you get what you came for?
Did you open up your mind, let go of your heart?
Did you get what you get what you came for?
Did you open up your mind, let go of your heart?

Oh if we lose it all together
Maybe love will last forever
(Maybe love will last for...)
Oh if we lose it all together
Maybe love will last forever
