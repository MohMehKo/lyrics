We are free if we want.
Move your feet.
Let’s sound the drum.
Come on. get up, now.
And get up, Love.
We are free if we wake up.
Oooh.
I was lost out on the ledge.
I prayed and prayed you’d bring me back.
But before you came I lost my head.
I was scared that love was dead.
Love’s not dead.
No, Love’s not dead.
We are free if we want.
Move your feet.
Let’s sound the drum.
Come on. Get up now.
And get up, Love.
We are free if we wake up.
(Move your feet. Lets sound the drum.)
We are free if we wake up.
Move your feet.
Lets sound the drum.
