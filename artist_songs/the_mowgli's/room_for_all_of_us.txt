It's gettin' hard to breathe
And I can barely sleep
Sometimes I just close my eyes and wish that I could dream
With the buildings stacking up
And the windows closing in
The city's gonna swallow us and spit us out again
But I see fields of green for miles

And if we stop to look around
There's room for all of us
So we'll find out
There's love in all of us
To fly, to live, to die and finally feel alive
Just stop and look around
There's room for all of us
There's room for all of us

It's more important now
Than it ever was before
To dance into the room of love
Before they slam the door
But the world's been keeping us
An universe apart
But I can feel the oneness in
The beating of our hearts
It's everywhere I was

And if we stop to look around
There's room for all of us
So we'll find out
There's love in all of us
To fly, to live, to die and finally feel alive
Just stop and look around
There's room for all of us
There's room for all of us

Yeah, there's always a vacancy
Well, there's a light on for you and me
And I'm finding what I believe
In a space between you and me

If we stop to look around
There's room for all of us
Soon we'll find out
There's love in all of us
To fly, to live, to die and finally feel alive
Just stop and look around
There's room for all of us
There's room for all of us
There's room for all of us
There's room for all of us
