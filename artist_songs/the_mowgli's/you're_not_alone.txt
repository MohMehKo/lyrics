You're not alone. No!
If you know how you wanna live why don't you live it?
If you know what you got to give you got to give it.
One breathe deeper than the last one
One step closer to the ones we love
You've been searching for the sun so long
I mean it when I say

You're not alone
Even when you feel so far from home
Everybody's here 
You're not alone
Screaming in the mirror saying

I've been broke,
Out of love
But I know
We're not alone. No!

If you know what you wanna say why don't you say it?
It don't matter what's in your hand you gotta play it
One voice calling for the next one
We stand closer to the ones we love
You've been searching for the sun
I mean it when I say

You're not alone
Even when you feel so far from home
Everybody's here 
You're not alone
Screaming in the mirror saying

I've been broke,
Out of love
But I know
We're not alone. No!

We're not alone! No!

One breathe deeper than the last one
One step closer to the ones we love
You've been searching for the sun so long
I mean it when I say

You're not alone
Even when you feel so far from home
Everybody's here 
You're not alone
Screaming in the mirror saying

I've been broke
Out of love
Maybe I drink too much

Cross my-
Out of luck
But I won't give up!

We're not alone!
You're not alone!
We're not alone!
