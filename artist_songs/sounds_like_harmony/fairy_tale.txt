I met this man out on the road
And he told me, "Son, I'll take you where you wanna go
You see the devil, he has his ways
It's not the life you lead, it's about the price you'll pay"

And then he told me once, you'll ever speak my name
And then he told me twice and let me slip away

"Fairy tales are make believe
And all the lies they tell to help you sleep
And live a life that's so demanding
When none of us get happy endings
Storybooks aren't what they seem
And all the lies they raised you to believe.
Be a good ol' boy and stop pretending
Cause you won't find your happy ending."

I had this vision out on my own
I had to pick and choose, I knew just what I had to do
So I set out to find this man
And curse his name for all I've paid
Whoa

And then he told me once, you'll ever speak my name.
And then he told me twice and let me slip away

"Fairy tales are make believe
And all the lies they tell to help you sleep
And live a life that's so demanding
When none of us get happy endings.
Storybooks aren't what they seem
And all the lies they raised you to believe
Be a good ol' boy and stop pretending
Cause you won't find your happy ending."

"Love me, hate me if you want,
But you will never be a star,
Unless you sign the dotted line
And write your name in dollar signs."
"Love me, hate me if you want,
But you will never be a star,
Unless you sign the dotted line
And write your name in dollar signs."

"Fairy tales are make believe
And all the lies they tell to help you sleep
And live a life that's so demanding
When none of us get happy endings.
Storybooks aren't what they seem
And all the lies they raised you to believe
Be a good ol' boy and stop pretending
Cause you won't find your happy ending."

Fairy tales are make believe
The happiest ending for someone like me
Fairy tales are make believe
So I'm better off if I die in my sleep
