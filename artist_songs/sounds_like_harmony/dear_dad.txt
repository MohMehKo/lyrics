My dad was a man of war
He said, some day son you will go forth
And you'll fly out and over the sea
Yeah, some day you'll be just like me

And I said, no dad I don't believe I can be what you want
But I'm afraid that some day you will find yourself lost
On this misguided path you're so desperate to lead
He said, you're no son of mine unless you follow me

Please lay down your gun
And we'll all fight for love
And the whole human race 
And the ones who got lost
And we'll all find our peace
When we find it in ourselves

Yeah I think dad...

My dad was a man for sure
Who set off on this god awful course
He said, some day son you'll fight for peace
But it's not what you want it to be

And I said, no dad I don't believe I can be what you want
But I'm afraid that some day you will find yourself lost
On this misguided path you're so desperate to lead
He said, you're no son of mine unless you follow me

Please lay down your gun
And we'll all fight for love
And the whole human race 
And the ones who got lost
And we'll all find our peace
When we find it in ourselves

Yeah I think dad
You should go home
Cause you're sounding kind of drunk
And I don't know
But you are scaring me and mom
Dad please just go

Lay down your gun
And we'll all fight for love
And the whole human race 
And the ones who got lost
And we'll all find our peace
When we find it in ourselves

Please lay down your gun
And we'll all fight for love
And the whole human race 
And the ones who got lost
And we'll all find our peace
When we find it in ourselves
When we find it in ourselves
Dad
