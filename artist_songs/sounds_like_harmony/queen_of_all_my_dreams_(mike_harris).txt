She is the queen of all of my dreams
Waits for me to sleep and she schemes
Unpredictable she seems
The queen of all of my dreams
Is it hers or is it mine
Is she a lunatic or a sign
Whatever we'll find out in time

Love has a habit of calling my name
Brings me joy and it brings me pain
Wants you to follow but nothings the same
She is the queen of all of my dreams
Waits for me to sleep then she schemes
Unpredictable she seems
The queen of all of my dreams
The future is blurry
The past its clear
Awake she cries
Can't you hear
