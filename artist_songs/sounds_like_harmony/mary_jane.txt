You came into my point of view just like the rising sun
the feeling lingered on my cheek, the goodbye kiss that you left me
The coffee on the table sitting patiently inside a cup
you made it just for me and that's the greatest part of waking up

And oh,
My Mary Jane, this cigarette won't taste the same
and oh, when you get home, we'll share some joe,
and smoke the night away

You came into my point of view, just like the rising moon
I see the stars begin to dance around
And time itself is slowing down
This coffee on the table sitting patiently inside a cup
you made it just for me and that's the greatest thing about this love

And oh,
My Mary Jane, this cigarette won't taste the same
and oh when you get home, we'll share some joe,
and smoke the night away
so baby oh

La ta ta la da da da da la da da da da da
And oh
La ta ta la da da da da la da da da da da

You came into my point of view just like the rising sun
the feeling lingered on my cheek, the goodbye kiss that you left me
The coffee on the table sitting patiently inside a cup
You made it just for me and that's the greatest part of waking up
