Don't you cry we're just around the bend we'll see the same blue skies again 
As sure as sun will rise I'll be by your side I promise that I'll make it just in time 

That California sunrise is screaming out my name
I'll be jumping on an airplane to see your face
all I know is that my heart is beating faster
now and swear we'll be together forever and ever after

We've got another year till graduations here
I know that we can make this last forever
you can count on me I won't go anywhere
you may be far away but I'll wait for you 

That California sunrise is screaming out my name
I'll be jumping on an airplane to see your face
all I know is that my heart is beating faster
now and swear we'll be together forever and ever after 

You may be far away by day to day you may fall in love and change your way
you make me feel like I'm not alone you're my home sweet home 

That California sunrise is screaming out my name
I'll be jumping on an airplane to see your face
all I know is that my heart is beating faster
now and swear we'll be together forever and ever after
