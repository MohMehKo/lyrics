Hey there, little miss sunshine
It sure feels good to know your mine
I'm singing in a new light looking in the brighter side
All alone in the pouring rain
I was such a crying shame living my life in a haze
Until I saw your pretty face
You turned the sky a shade of blue
You dried my eyes and I saw the truth that you
Your beautiful
Hey there, little miss blue sky's
I'm looking into your blue eyes
Seeing for the first time bright now that your mine
All alone in the pouring rain
I was such a crying shame living my life in a haze
Until I saw your pretty face
You turned the sky a shade of blue
You dried my eyes and I saw the truth that you,
Your beautiful
Hey there, little miss sunshine
It sure feels good to know your mine
you came out and dried the ran now today's a better day
