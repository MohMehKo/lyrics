It's all fun and games, 'til someone pops a molly
Holla where my shawties at, now it's a party
We party all day, we party all night
Put your drinks up (cups)
Everybody hide, everybody hide, (everybody hide)

Hey everybody, have you heard the news?
They puttin' up shit that I can't do too
You can ask my friends, now I've told you once,
I've told you twice, you'll feel alright

It's all fun and games, 'til someone pops a molly
Holla where my shawties at, now it's a party
We party all day, we party all night
Put your drinks up (cups)
Everybody hide, everybody hide, (everybody hide)

Back, back to the beat
Click clack, repeat
I'll be up in your head, but you can't see
Don't take it from me, but the word on the street
Is we got the slack, as seen on TV

It's all fun and games, 'til someone pops a molly
Holla where my shawties at, now it's a party
We party all day, we party all night
Put your drink up (cups)
Everybody hide, everybody hide, (everybody hide)

I'm just tryna do somethings that don't make sense
We decide it's so much better when it don't make sense
You know, everyone around me's driving me insane
It's all fun and games until the music fades, away now.

It's all fun and games 'til someone pops a molly
Holla where my shawties at, now its a party
We party all day, we party all night
Put your drinks up (cups)
Everybody hide, everybody hide, (everybody hide)
