If I say that I love you, just don't say a word
though I'd rather hear a lie then feel another hurt
and if I try to kiss you just push me away
cause I'd rather wonder than to know what got away

So sing me a lullaby
so I can finally fall asleep
but not just a song
cause I'd rather die than believe
that our dreams, are imaginary things
and it seems it's a nightmare to me
so please sing me to sleep

If I say that I'm leaving
please don't let me go
cause I was only saying this just so I'd know
that you'd rather fight for me
than let me love another girl
you wouldn't trade me for the world
and I would just hold you
and we could pretend
that I was the gravity that loved to pull you in
and if you say that you want me
I'll say that I need you
and I'll be the only thing
you need to fall into.

So sing me a lullaby
so I can finally fall asleep
but not just a song
cause I'd rather die than believe
that our dreams are imaginary things
and it seems it's a nightmare to me
so please sing me to sleep

And if I never woke up again
would you try to pretend
that I was only ever there to be a friend
but if I had a chance
and I hope you understand
that I would die to be the one that holds your hand
