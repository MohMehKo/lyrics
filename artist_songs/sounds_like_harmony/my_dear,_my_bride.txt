Looking at herself
With blood on the mirror
A beautiful face
That's never been clear
She's never felt bigger with a finger on the trigger
I'm down on my knees
I beg and I plead
You don't have to be alone no

Lay down the gun, my dear my bride
And we'll watch the sun rise one more time
I won't sing another note
Till you change your mind
I beg you stop crying I'm just in
Time

Princess of posture she keeps a straight face
The scars on her wrist, no they can't be erased
Cut from the same words that are loading the gun
It is not over until it's done
You don't have to be alone no

Lay down the gun, my dear my bride
And we'll watch the sun rise one more time
I won't sing another note
Till you change your mind
I beg you stop crying I'm just in

Time is running out my love, your heart is slowing down
I'll mend your broken wings and pick your feet up off of the ground
Ruby red princess, you can be my shinning star
I won't leave a face like that left out in the dark
You are not alone

Lay down the gun, my dear my bride
And we'll watch the sun rise one more time
I won't sing another note
Till you change your mind
I beg you stop crying
I'm just in time
