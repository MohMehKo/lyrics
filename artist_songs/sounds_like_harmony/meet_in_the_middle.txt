I gave my heart to the girl next door
She feels that close to me and I am sure
That all my friends don't understand me
Quite frankly, I don't give a damn
Cause I don't think that they can take it
And they don't think that we can make it

Hey everybody, can we meet in the middle
Couple friends that I never seen
Got a cool girlfriend that don't give a damn
So hey everybody, could you meet in the middle with me

I've been looking for some piece of mind
Now listen up, cause here's a piece of mine
I've told my folks cause they don't know
But I've sold my soul to the open road
Now I don't think that I can take it
Cause I don't think that I can make it

Hey everybody, can we meet in the middle
Got a couple friends that I never seen
Got a cool girlfriend that don't give a damn
So hey everybody, could you meet in the middle with me

Hey everybody, if you wanna go
Grab your partner let's do-si-do
You took my hand
In our first dance
Romance

Hey everybody, if you wanna go
Grab your partner let's do-si-do

Romance

Hey everybody, can we meet in the middle
Got a couple friends that I never seen
Got a cool girlfriend that don't give a damn
So hey everybody, could you meet in the middle

Hey everybody, can we meet in the middle
Got a couple friends that I never seen
Got a cool girlfriend that don't give a damn
So hey everybody, could you meet in the middle with me
