I hopped on the bus and I drove all night
Destination get away from me
As she looked me in the eyes, said I'd be alright
This is everything you wanted to be

I'm exactly where I wanna be but so far away
Well if home is where the heart is, then please keep it safe
I know that you're sick of all of my issues
But try to understand all the shit that I've been through

I'm trying my hardest
I know it gets awkward
All that I've been through left a hole where my heart is
I tried to give you everything
I know I get nervous
I'm a nervous filthy boy
You're just the girl I fell in love with

I think to myself as I lay on the floor
This is everything you've wanted
Now you're asking for more
You pick up the phone
I say "When I come back home I'll be everything you wanted me to be"

I'm exactly where I wanna be but so far away
Well if home is where the heart is, then please keep it safe
I know that you're sick of all of my issues
But try to understand all the shit that I've been through

I'm trying my hardest
I know it gets awkward
All that I've been through left a hole where my heart is
I tried to give you everything
I know I get nervous
I'm a nervous filthy boy
You're just the girl I fell in love with

(Trying my hardest, I know it gets awkward)
(Cause you make me nervous, you're the girl I fell in love with)
(Trying my hardest, I know it gets awkward)
(Cause you make me nervous, you're the girl I fell in love with)

I'm trying my hardest
I know it gets awkward
All that I've been through left a hole where my heart is
I tried to give you everything
I know I get nervous
I'm a nervous filthy boy
You're just the girl I fell in love with
