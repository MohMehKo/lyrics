I know we're only fifteen
But you mean the world to me
And I am ready for tonight 

Here we are all alone
And I'm sliding off your clothes
I hope tonight is the night
Where we finally get this right
I kiss your lips, you hold your breath
And I can taste your innocence
I hope your mom's not coming home
Cause we're both dead if she ever knows

I know we're only fifteen
But you mean the world to me
And I am ready for tonight
I know we're only fifteen
But I'd give you everything
And these fireworks
Will ignite

I throw you on your bed
And I can feel your every breath
Upon my neck cause you're so loud
And I can finally be proud
To be your first and your last
Close your eyes and don't look back
Just say that you love me so
Cause it's all I really need to know

I know we're only fifteen
But you mean the world to me
And I am ready for tonight
I know we're only fifteen
But I'd give you everything
And these fireworks
Will ignite

I've been waiting my whole life for this
Here I thought we were only kids but we're growing up so fast
I've been waiting my whole life for this
Just one chance to never look back and give it all away
For you

I was only fifteen
Thought I knew everything 
Got my whole life to get this right

I know we're only fifteen
But you mean the world to me
And I am ready for tonight
I know we're only fifteen
But I'd give you everything
And these fireworks
And these fireworks
Will ignite
