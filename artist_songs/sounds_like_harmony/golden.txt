You taught me to glow
What glitters is golden
You taught me to love the world
Even when I feel alone
And I never run away
'Cause I know in my soul
That everything's okay

You taught me to flower
You taught me to grow
Even when the world is turning slowly
And now I can breathe
I'm finally free
Now that I've learned to love myself
More than you ever did love me

I taught you love
And I showed you trust
And then you gave it all away
To some boy that showed you lust
And you can't believe that
That the sun will always be
And everything is golden
