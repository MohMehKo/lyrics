Where did the summer time go
when will it snow
it already feels like snowin' over head
because it feels like it's freezing at the break of dawn
and he starts off like winter storm and it feels like I'm sinking in deeper deeper in this October
for cold autumn nights
keep me up keep me warm tonight keep me warm
in this October oh it feels like I'm drownin' and I am sinking low, and I'm sinking low low low
I am sinking low

Maybe I'm the cause of all this pain
I'm buying so deep in the night
maybe I'm just going insane
cause it's a cold cold night
I wanna hold you so so tight
and never let go in this October
the cold autumn nights keep me up keep me warm tonight keep me warm
in this October it feels like I'm drownin' and I am sinking low and I am sinking low low low
I am sinking low

When you fall asleep tonight
I hope you think of me standing in the rain waiting for you
and I'll be cryin' like a waterfall when I had to walk into cold
and I fall asleep tonight thinking about you in this October
the cold autumn nights keep me up keep me warm tonight keep me warm
in this October oh it feels like I'm drownin' and I am sinking low and I am sinking low low low
I am sinking low
