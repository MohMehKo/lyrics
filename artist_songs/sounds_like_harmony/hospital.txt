You stole my heart right from the start
We fell in love, we fell apart
I wasn't ready,
I wasn't ready to go
But I tried though it hurts
And the drugs never worked
With the taste of repetition
Now we found our back
I know I say this all the time
We're better then ever
but you seem like the type
To love...
And run away

When you're lying awake on your hospital bed
And you're thinking to yourself hell,
I'm better off dead
I'll remind you
You've been reconstructed beautifully
And I can't live my life without you

I always second guess cause you're so well dressed
And I'm overrated
But I always knew this
From the moment we kissed
It taste like
Something I could get used to
Now we found our back
I know I say this all the time
We're better then ever
but you seem like the type
To love...
And run away

When you're lying awake on your hospital bed
And you're thinking to yourself hell,
I'm better off dead
I'll remind you
We've been reconstructed beautifully
And I can't live my life without you
I can't live my life without you
I can't live my life without you
And I'll tell you over and over and over and over again
