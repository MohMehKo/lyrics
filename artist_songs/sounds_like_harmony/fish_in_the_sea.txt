This world is an ocean and you keep me floating so I can breathe
I had the notion that I was just swimming alone
Sinking alone in the dark
You came to save me, carried me to safety
And out of all the fish in the sea
I knew that you, you were the one for me

Tossing and turning can't keep this mess up
I don't have much time
When another day is another night is another day floating by
And I, I felt so alone
The moment that you caught my eye
Was the moment you saved my life

This world is an ocean and you keep me floating so I can breathe
I had the notion that I was just swimming alone
Sinking alone in the dark
And you came to save me, carried me to safety
And out of all the fish in the sea
I knew that you, you were the one for me

Days were passing and waves came crashing down
And I had it all figured out
I knew you'd be the one to pull me out
When I, I felt so alone
The moment that you caught my eye
Was the moment you saved my life

This world is an ocean and you keep me floating so I can breathe
I had the notion that I was just swimming alone
Sinking alone in the dark
You came to save me, carried me to safety
And out of all the fish in the sea
I knew that you, you were the one for me
