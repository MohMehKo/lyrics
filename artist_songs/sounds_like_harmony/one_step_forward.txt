I dreamt away most of my nights instead of sleeping 
Honestly I couldn't seem to find a reason to close my eyes and lay in the dark

This world is brighter [?]
I didn't know just what this life was all about
the answers easy and I figured it out
take one step forward and two steps out of this town 

I slept away most of my days instead of hanging out
honestly its hard to find the motivation now
when everyone I know is so washed up

This world is brighter [?]
I didn't know just what this life was all about
the answers easy and I figured it out
take one step forward and two steps out of this town

Out of this town 

This world is brighter [?]
I didn't know just what this life was all about
the answers easy and I figured it out
take one step forward and two steps out of this town
