I've been thinking lately maybe
I should leave this town and run away
Today
See how am I to chase the sun
When every cloud I've known is dark and gray?
Okay

I've been lookin' for the brighter days
And the sun came out and I saw your face
Now I know, I'll be okay
Cuz it got cold and I was feelin' sad
But you kept me warm now it ain't so bad
Cuz I've got you, and you've got me,
Today

I've been thinking lately maybe
I should finally wake up from this dream,
Ya see
But how am I to end in sleep
When I can't form a new reality,
For me?

I've been lookin' for the brighter days
And the sun came out and I saw your face
Now I know, I'll be okay
Cuz it got cold and I was feelin' sad
But you kept me warm now it ain't so bad
Cuz I've got you, and you've got me,
Today

But what the hell am I supposed to do?
When my whole life has been a dream,
Nothing's real or so it seems,
And all I want to do is run away?

I've been lookin' for the brighter days
And the sun came out and I saw your face
Now I know, I'll be okay
Cuz it got cold and I was feelin' sad
But you kept me warm now it ain't so bad
Cuz I've got you, and you've got me,
Today
