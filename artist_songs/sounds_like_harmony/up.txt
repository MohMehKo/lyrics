A social ladder but you can't break out

Social outcast
Got some cool friends but you can't stand it
'Cause you can't stand them

I was going up, up, up
She wasn't in it for the love, love, love
But I think I finally had enough-nough-nough
And now I'm ready to give up, up, up
See, I was going up, up, up
'Cause I was in it for the love, love, love
But I think I finally had enough-nough-nough
And now I'm ready to give up, up, up

So frustrated from conversations
With stupid ex's I fucking hate them
And all the cool kids that act like cool kids
They got some new friends and I can't stand it
'Cause I can't stand them

I was going up, up, up
She wasn't in it for the love, love, love
But I think I finally had enough-nough-nough
And now I'm ready to give up, up, up
See, I was going up, up, up
'Cause I was in it for the love, love, love
But I think I finally had enough-nough-nough
And now I'm ready to give up, up, up

Once upon a time
You used to tuck me in at night
And told me about the king and queen
And the land of make-believe
Am I way too fucking blind?
Am I looking for love in all the wrong places?
Mom, you taught me well when you said that love's a fairy tale

Up, up, up
She wasn't in it for the love, love, love
But I think I finally had enough-nough-nough
And now I'm ready to give up, up, up
Up, up, up
'Cause I was in it for the love, love, love
But I think I finally had enough-nough-nough
And now I'm ready to give up, up, up

'Cause I was going up, up, up,
She wasn't in it for the love, love, love
But I think I finally had enough-nough-nough
And now I'm ready to give up, up, up
See, I was going up, up, up
'Cause I was in it for the love, love, love
But I think I finally had enough-nough-nough
And now I'm ready to give up, up, up...

...on love.
