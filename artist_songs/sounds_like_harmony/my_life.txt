So close I could kiss the sun,
But now we're on the run we were going no where fast
And now we're nothing at all
I ever wanted was to keep moving on
And now the silly dreams of heart tattoos
Are up in smoke thats how it goes

In my life
In my fairytales
Stuck in a dream, inside a living hell
Please wake me up, I can't wake up
This is a nightmare
To be in love with you

To know how forever feels
Paint a picture I know is real
I'd write a song to tell the tales,
But our words are in deep wont let them
Out of sight and out of mind
Won't fall asleep when you're not mine
I'm not alright but I'll be just fine

In my life
In my fairytales
Stuck in a dream, inside a living hell
Please wake me up, I can't wake up
This is a nightmare
To be in love with

You are the only one that I could ever dream about
The one that I can't breathe without
The one who's heart is slowing down
You're slipping, fading out
The future's getting darker
But I guess that's how it goes

In my life
In my fairytales
Stuck in a dream, inside a living hell
Please wake me up, I can't wake up
This is a nightmare
To be in love
In my life
In my fairytales
Stuck in a dream, inside a living hell
Please wake me up, I can't wake up
This is a nightmare
To be in love with you
With you
