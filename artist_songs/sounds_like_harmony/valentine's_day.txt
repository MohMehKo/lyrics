Roses are red, violets are blue
I been searching for some one who's just like you
Exes and oh's nobody knows but I've got something to say to you
So I wrote it all down
In a letter
Cause my lips are scared to speak
To a girl who's outta my league

I know I'm just another boy along the way
I wanna be yours on valentine's day
I got butterfly kisses
Flying your way
I wanna be yours on valentine's day
What do you say
What do you say

Roses are red, violets are blue
I wont stop til I have you until your mine
Exes and oh's everyone knows there's nothing left to say to you
So I wrote it all down
In a letter
Cause my lips are scared to speak
To a girl who's outta my league

I know I'm just another boy along the way
I wanna be yours on valentine's day
I got butterfly kisses
Flying your way
I wanna be yours on valentine's day
What do you say
What do you say

To sunshine daisies sunny days for you
A little love note just to say that I love you

I know I'm just another boy along the way
I wanna be yours on valentine's day
I got butterfly kisses
Flying your way
I wanna be yours on valentine's day
What do you say
Just say
Yes
