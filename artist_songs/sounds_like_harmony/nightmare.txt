Look at us now would we be proud
Didn't know we'd be screaming out loud
Just three years ago
You stole my soul
Let's not pretend I'm all you know
And if you ever leave please leave my heart at
Home

Cause every god damn day feels like you're killing me
Over again and I can't take it
Cause the drugs are never good enough
And I can't pretend I'm hurt enough
So I guess I like it

Look at us then when we were friends
But I loved you more then I ever did
Just three years ago
You stole my soul
Can we pretend I'm all you know
And if you ever leave please leave my heart at home

Cause every god damn day feels like your killing me
Over again and I can't take it
Cause the drugs are never good enough
And I can't pretend I'm hurt enough
So I guess I like it

Oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Oh my god this is a nightmare
And it scares me to be in love
Oh my god this is a nightmare
But I guess I like it
Oh my god this is a nightmare
And it scares me to be in love
Oh my god this is a nightmare
To love

Cause every god damn day feels like you're killing me
Over again and I can't take it
Cause the drugs are never good enough
And I can't pretend I'm hurt enough
So I guess I like it

I guess I like it
Yeah, I guess I like it
