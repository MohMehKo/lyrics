Well when you're too cool for school,
You've gotta play by the rules.
Yeah you can call yourself a hipster,
But they don't care for rock n roll.
So try as you need,
But they ain't easy to please.
They'll drive you wild.

Oh flower child of the new generation
Flower child of the new generation

I've been waking around,
Wondering what in the hell,
Is up with the world,
And where did we go wrong.
I don't need my education to see

That when you're too cool for school,
You've gotta play by the rules.
Yeah you can call yourself a hipster,
But they don't care for rock n roll.
So try as you need,
But they ain't easy to please.
They'll drive you wild.

Oh flower child of the new generation
Flower child of the new generation

I've been stumbling around,
Dazed and confused,
Smoking the green to take away my blues.
If you use imagination you'll see

That when you're too cool for school,
You've gotta play by the rules.
Yeah you can call yourself a hipster,
But they don't care for rock n roll.
So try as you need,
But they ain't easy to please.
They'll drive you wild.
(Wild)

Flower child of the new generation
Flower child of the new generation

Don't need my education
To use imagination
Don't need my education
To use imagination
Don't need my education
To use imagination
Don't need my education
To use imagination
