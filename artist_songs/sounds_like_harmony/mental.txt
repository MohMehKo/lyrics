And I'm terrified of what you'll think
When you see the me that no one sees
When you see the things I keep left in the dark
And I'm terrified of what you'll find
When you hear the thoughts that haunt my mind
The monster that I keep inside my head

And I swear I'm not okay
Although I try to force a smile
I swear I'm not okay
This thing is taking over

Someone, get me mental help
I'm concerned about my mental health
I think a lot about you
The wolf that's raging on inside my head
Someone, save me from myself
I'm concerned about my mental health
I think a lot about you
The wolf that's raging on inside my head

And I'm scared to death of what you'll think
Of me when I break down and start to scream
I'm not okay, I'm not okay
I wish these thoughts would go away
I got a couple pills that I could take
I know it breaks my heart but that's okay
Cause everything, everything would go away

And I swear I'm not okay
Although I try to force a smile
I swear I'm not okay
This thing is taking over

Someone, get me mental help
I'm concerned about my mental health
I think a lot about you
The wolf that's raging on inside my head
Someone, save me from myself
I'm concerned about my mental health
I think a lot about you
The wolf that's raging on inside my head

Go away, go away, come again another day
Go away, go away, come again another day
Go away, go away, come again another day
Go away, go away, come again another

Someone, get me mental help
I'm concerned about my mental health
I think a lot about you
The wolf that's raging on inside my head
Someone, save me from myself
I'm concerned about my mental health
I think a lot about you
The wolf that's raging on inside my head
