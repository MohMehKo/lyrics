I met you on the west coast
It's funny how it happens
When you don't have a clue
But I sure love you

We could talk for hours on the cell phone
And I won't go, if you don't want me to

Band-aids don't fix broken hearts
Like fire from a simple spark
And one day when this world grows dark
We will still see heart to heart
Sharpie pens will wash away
From water in the pouring rain
But oh my love I'm here to stay
It goes to show that some things were just never meant to change

Every time you hold my hand
I begin to understand
That I don't want to leave
Cause I sure need you

And every fight I wish I'd miss
To never be too far from this
Cause I don't want to go
If you don't want me to

Band-aids don't fix broken hearts
Like fire from a simple spark
And one day when this world grows dark
We will still see heart to heart
Sharpie pens will wash away
From water in the pouring rain
But oh my love I'm here to stay
It goes to show that some things were just never meant to change

If you want to go, love, I don't think I'm ready,
I don't think I'm ready, love
Shut up and kiss me
I don't want to go, love, I don't think I'm ready,
I don't think I'm ready, love
Boy, are you listening?
If you want to go, love, I don't think I'm ready,
I don't think I'm ready, love
Shut up and kiss me
I don't want to go, love, I don't think I'm ready,
I don't think I'm ready, love
Boy, are you listening? Shut up and kiss me

Band-aids don't fix broken hearts
Like fire from a simple spark
And one day when this world grows dark
We will still see heart to heart
Sharpie pens will wash away
From water in the pouring rain
But oh my love I'm here to stay
It goes to show that some things were just
Please tell me that this will never change
