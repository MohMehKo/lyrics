I know what it means when you hardly reply,
And there's no signs of interest 'cause I'm not the guy
You're waiting for.

Do you know what it means for me to try?
You're one in a million and I'm not the type
To give it all, and run away.

So, I smile at the mirror and I scream at the glass.
It's the only thing that makes me feel like something loves me back,
Because I hate my image and I'm better off dead,
But I'd rather die alone than be with anyone else.

Now, I've fallen in love and I've picked myself up
And I trusted a girl, but it wasn't enough
And I've been torn to pieces and put myself back.
Now, I'm calling your bluff
I know better than that,

Because all that I see when I look at you
Is a girl that wants love from a boy that ain't true.
He tore you to pieces and let you down,
But I'm not just some boy who's playing around when

I smile at the mirror and I scream at the glass.
It's the only thing that makes me feel like something loves me back,
Because I hate my image and I'm better off dead,
But I'd rather die alone than be with anyone else.

So, if you're ever afraid of what you'll find,
When your body grows cold, but your heart is alive,
I'll be there.

And if you're ever afraid of what you'll find,
When your fingers get lonely, but your heart doesn't mind,
I'll be there.

'Cause I smile at the mirror and I scream at the glass.
It's the only thing that makes me feel like something loves me back
Because I hate my image and I'm better off dead
But I'd rather die alone than be with anyone else.

Well, I smile at the mirror and I scream at the glass.
It's the only thing that makes me feel like something loves me back
Because I hate my image and I'm better off dead
But I'd rather die alone than be with anyone else.

I'd rather die alone than be with anyone else.
