I know I let you down,
you've finally had enough.
The honest part is everybody fucks up
And I know I said some things,
That I swear I didn't mean
But that just makes me see
You stole my heart it meant the world
But now your just a ghost and I'm unsure

And I'm a afraid that I'll never sing of love,
So sick of never being good enough
Won't someone save my soul
So I don't have to be afraid
That I will die alone

I know you can't believe
I know your scared of me,
The hardest part is that everyone else can see
That I was meant for you
And you were meant for me,
Let's sink the ship into the sea
You stole my heart it meant the world
But now your just a ghost and I'm unsure

And I'm a afraid that I'll never sing of love,
So sick of never being good enough
Won't someone save my soul
So I don't have to be afraid that
I will die alone
So I don't have to be afraid that
I will die alone
So I don't have to be afraid that
I will die alone
No you don't have to be afraid that you will die alone
