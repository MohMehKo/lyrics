I stepped outside my door so I can see the sun
I spent my life in the dark and I'm on the run
Cause nothing feels as real as the first time that you bleed
I never felt alone until I wanted to leave

I wanna see the light on these dark nights
Let's kiss the stars and say goodnight
Or follow all these dreams were true love will find me
And bring the sunrise so I can see the light

I stepped outside my door so I can see the truth
I spend some time alone and now I'm searching for you
Cause nothing feels as real as the first time that you breathe
I never felt alone until I wanted to bleed

I wanna see the light on these dark nights
Let's kiss the stars and say goodnight
Or follow all these dreams were true love will find me
And bring the sunrise so I can see the light

I wanna see the light on these dark nights
Let's kiss the stars and say goodnight
Or follow all these dreams were true love will find me
And bring the sunrise so I can see the light
