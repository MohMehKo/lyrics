I can't tell but notice that we fallen out of line,
I've been across the universe another place in time
But it seems like everyone I know forgot just what its like
To love love love love love
And I had enough
It's time for us to make a change forget about our yesterday
It's time for us to make a change let the music save today

I can't tell but wonder if life can be a dream
Overthrow the government and live in harmony
But it seems like everyone I know forgot just what it feels
To love love love love love
And I had enough
It's time for us to make a change forget about our yesterday
It's time for us to make a change let the music save today

Let's love love love love love
But I had enough
It's time for us to make a change forget about our yesterday
It's time for us to make a change let the music save today
