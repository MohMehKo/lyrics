Just like autumn, everything will fall,
All around me.
Like winter everything will freeze,
And you're barely breathing.
I can assure you that,
Its not a bluff cause,
I wanna have you, until then,
I'll never give up.

Oh my love, save it for a rainy day,
Its not much, but I like you.
Oh my love, save it for a rainy day,
But I wanna have you.

Just like spring you bring me back to life
Its a fact of nature
Like summer, everything feels right.
So let me steal your sunshine.
I can assure you that
Its not a bluff cause,
I wanna have you, until then,
I'll never give up.

Oh my love, save it for a rainy day,
Its not much, but I like you.
Oh my love, save it for a rainy day,
But I wanna have you.

Can you assure me that
Its not a bluff cause,
I wanna have you until then,
I'll never give up

Oh my love, save it for a rainy day,
Its not much, but I like you.
Oh my love, save it for a rainy day,

Oh my love, save it for a rainy day,
Its not much, but I like you,
Oh my love, save it for a rainy day,
But I wanna have you.
