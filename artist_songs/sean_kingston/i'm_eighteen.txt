[Intro:]
Ya man,
Sean Kingston,
Declare Yourself,
Let's go!

[Chorus:]
I'm eighteen,
And I don't know what I want,
Eighteen,
I just don't know what I want,
Eighteen,
I'm just a vote away,
I've gotta get out of this place, oh yeah.

[Verse 1:]
Lines form on my face and hands,
Lines form from the ups and down,
I'm in the middle without any plans,
I'm a boy and I'm a man.

[Chorus:]
I'm eighteen,
And I don't know what I want,
Eighteen,
I just don't know what I want,
Eighteen,
I'm just a vote away,
I've gotta get out of this place.

[Verse 2:]
I got a baby's brain and an old man's heart,
Took eighteen years just to get this far,
Don't always know what I'm talkin' about,
Feels like I'm livin' in the middle of doubt,
Cause I'm...

[Chorus:]
I'm eighteen,
And I don't know what I want,
Eighteen,
I just don't know what I want,
Eighteen,
I'm just a vote away,
I've gotta get out of this place, oh yeah.

[Verse 3:]
Lines form on my face and my hands,
Lines form on the left and right,
I'm in the middle, the middle of life,
I'm a boy and I'm a man.

[Brigde:]
I'm eighteen and I like it!
Yes, I like it!
Ohh, I like it!
Love it, like it, love it!

[Chorus:]
I'm eighteen!
I'm eighteen!
I'm eighteen,
And I don't know what I want,
Eighteen,
I just don't know what I want,
Eighteen,
I'm just a vote away,
I've gotta get out of this place, oh yeah.

I'm eighteen,
And I don't know what I want,
Eighteen,
I just don't know what I want,
Eighteen,
I'm just a vote away,
I've gotta get out of this place, oh yeah.
