Checkin' Tracy, eyeing Stacey
Stuck in the club still lookin' for love

'Cause I I I I I ain't got no shorty
That's why I'm Calling Barbra, texting Carla
Stuck in the club still lookin' for love

I said I'm lookin' for love
Not askin' for much
Just a fine little shorty
With a big ol' butt

That's willing to cuss
She got drink in her cup
And we can take it to the floor
And tear it up

So she calls me up when she wants to get busy
I am the man, I am the business
I'm tellin' you all with God as my witness

I'm really a youth but I'm telling the truth
I am a pimp I got them sexy girls
Got so plenty don't know who to choose

I I I I I ain't got no shorty
That's why I'm

Love what your breakin'
Down down down down
