Girl when I met you, you was like a fire, you had me going crazy.
You was the one for me, the one I could call my only baby,
Now you gone away and I'm so sad today, but I guess that's just the way that love goes.
And now I know she is deceiving, I try so hard just to please her, it's too late heyy, I need to walk away ay ay ayeh.

So for loving too much, I guess that's what I get.
You gave me your heart and then you took it right back, and I never thought you would do me like that.
Now I know, I know, I know it's just the way that love go, go goes, it's just the way that love go, go goes,
It's the way that love go, go, goes so now it's time for me to go, go, go, go.

Now it's not the same, same I'm the lame and now you not my lady.
Gave me your heart and took it right back, ooh yeah girl that's so shady.
I'm so over you, I'm lost and confused, but I guess that's just the way that loves goes.
And now I know she is deceiving, I try so hard just to please her, it's too late heyy, I need to walk away ay ay ayeh.

So for loving too much, I guess that's what I get.
You gave me your heart and then you took it right back, and I never thought that you would do me like that.
Now I know, I know, I know it's just the way that love go, go goes, it's just the way that love go, go goes,
It's the way that love go, go, goes so now it's time for me to go, go, go, go.

I don't wanna let you go, girl tell my why you wanna go, I don't wanna let you go today, today, eh.
I don't wanna let you go, girl tell me why you wanna go, I don't wanna let you go today, today, eh.
