Girl you make me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, dum bee dum, dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Our love is so
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, dum bee dum, dumb
Wha, wha, why

You tell me that you need me
But then you wanna leave me
And never make your way to the door
I tell you that you’re too much
And that I’ll miss you too much
Don’t even know what we’re fighting for
You keep my car, girl
And then you go get it fixed
I talk to all them other chicks
Just to make you jealous
How can we make it right?
When we both put up a fit
You make me so mad
It's kind of hard to forget
But when I look into your pretty eyes
My heart just drops

Girl you make me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, dum bee dum, dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Our love is so
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, dum bee dum, dumb
Wha, wha, why

You always talking reckless
Sending a text message
Telling me to pack and your gone
And then I get a call a minute
You sounded so innocent
Saying that you can't sleep alone
I hope I never receive to show
How you spend all my dough
You wanna go in some other room
And burn up all of my clothes
How can we make it right?
When we put up a fit
You make me so mad
It's kind of hard to forget
But when I look into your pretty eyes
My heart just drops

Girl you make me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, dum bee dum, dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Our love is so
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, dum bee dum, dumb
Wha, wha, why

Calling it quits just ain't
What we were built for
I'd rather love you
Than to hate you girl
I want you to know

You're my, you're my
You're my shawty
Say you're my, you're my
You're my shawty

Girl you make me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, dum bee dum, dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Our love is so
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, dum bee dum, dumb
Wha, wha, why

Girl you make me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, dum bee dum, dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Our love is so
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, dum bee dum, dumb
Wha, wha, why
