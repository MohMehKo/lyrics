You remind me of my coupe, I wanna ride
Something like my gun, I wanna talk to you, baby
You can be anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
So now I'm giving that shotta luv, luv
So now I'm giving that shotta luv, luv
So now I'm giving that shotta luv, luv

New office, top fix, put it in her service
All my cars got curtains, care them niggas, it's currents
OV, bubble bath with that rose, I'm a shotta
Put her in the Audi for my Honda, now she want the anaconda
Things getting crazy, we got that chemistry, let's make babies
And this my testimony, I wanna be alone with you
You are so phenomenal, I wish I had a corner you
Pictures all in my phone of you, let me park in your garage
When I crank that thing up, you got my back like a massage
And like a Dodge I charge, my bills are larger, my assets, too, salute

You remind me of my coupe, I wanna ride
Something like my gun, I wanna talk to you, baby
You can be anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
So now I'm giving that shotta luv, luv
So now I'm giving that shotta luv, luv
So now I'm giving that shotta luv, luv

Let's go in, you know that, it's going down
Come sun down, for us it's just starting now
Kinda wearing that dress, time just arrived
For you to come alive
Baby, baby, me, baby
I can love you till you finally see, baby
It's you, baby, you, baby
Let me show you what I'm 'bout to do, baby

You remind me of my coupe, I wanna ride
Something like my gun, I wanna talk to you, baby
You can be anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
So now I'm giving that shotta luv, luv
So now I'm giving that shotta luv, luv
So now I'm giving that shotta luv, luv
