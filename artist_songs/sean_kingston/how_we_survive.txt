And the drinks start flowing when we hit midnight
This is how we survive
Show you a kind world that will change your life
Where the music playing loud and the place go wild
And the drinks start flowing when we hit midnight
This is how we survive
Dj drop that bomb, bomb, bomb
The whole club go dumb, dumb, dumb
And it don't matter where ya from, from, from
We party as one,
This is how we survive

[Verse 2:]
Them outside suiting but them can't hit me
I'm east side vibing pull up the DJ
We only live once, so no matter what they say
We party from Kingston to MIA

It's a konkrete jungle outside but we in it
Lighters in the sky put them high let me see them
Wifes in the building let me know what you feelin
We don't want to murder but you know we bout to kill it

[Hook:]
We going underground 'til the sun come rise
Where the music playing loud and the place go wild
And the drinks start flowing when we hit midnight
This is how we survive
Show you a kind world that will change your life
Where the music playing loud and the place go wild
And the drinks start flowing when we hit midnight
This is how we survive
Dj drop that bomb, bomb, bomb
The whole club go dumb, dumb, dumb
And it don't matter where ya from, from, from
We party as one,
This is how we survive

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, yeah,
Hey yo Sean Kingston make sure Shorty over there pass me one of those chug
Chugging
Looping on them batch, and I don't mean to brag
But when I get up on the mic and I fuck it up everybody else get mad
Put all of my money in the bag, her amaze everything swag
Too many broads can't fit up in the whip everybody else get a cab
What a vibe, what a vibe, what a vibe nr.1
And you sittin' way I slip up at a place
And on my shit tough until it done
Them blacking since burn I really see the God that I've become
And I mac everybody run away the fly, they godless where they from
Now I'm a sling thing, they got me sling thing
And I broke up that cup it don't matter what the rest bring
You can't find me I'm at the crib in the west wing
While I'm seeing beat

[Outro:]
Dj drop that bomb, bomb, bomb
The whole club go dumb, dumb, dumb
And it don't matter where ya from, from, from
We party as one,
This is how we survive
Dj drop that bomb, bomb, bomb
The whole club go dumb, dumb, dumb
And it don't matter where ya from, from, from
We party as one,
This is how we survive
Dj drop that bomb
