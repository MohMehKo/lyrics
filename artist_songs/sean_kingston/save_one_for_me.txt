Got my heart broken I never wanna see you again
You know that you're...
Took me in, took me out
Love was gone and it was the air

Too many girls around so
Save one for me
'Cus you don't deserve no more
Gave you everything you left at my door
It's ok I wish all again before
Too many girls around so
Save one for me
Save one for me
Save one for me
I'm single now
Too many girls around so
Save one for me
Save one for me
Save one for me
I'm single now
Too many girls around so
Save one for me

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Save one for me, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Together we were one
Never thought you could go
Love so high and I think we overdosed
But now I'm gonna moving on
You broke me down now I'm feeling strong
We gonna hit the cub
Finna throw my deuces up
Got all my niggas with me
And this world is filled with girls so

Save one for me
Save one for me
Save one for me
I'm single now
Too many girls around so
Save one for me
Save one for me
Save one for me
I'm single now
Too many girls around so
Save one for me

So many girl in the world tonight
Save one for me now
I'm so glad I got you out of my mind
Too many girls in here right now so

Save one for me
Save one for me
Save one for me
I'm single now
Too many girls around so
Save one for me
Save one for me
Save one for me
I'm single now
Too many girls around so
Save one for me

Save one for me
Save one for me
Save one for me
