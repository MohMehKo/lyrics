I know you’re down and you know I feel the same way,

Gucci in your eyes, cause I know you like to see a lot,
We’re so hot, that you could feel your ears pop.

Never price it, swipe it, bite it up!
My Shwaty gonna love me no matter what,

Shwaty got love and I don’t gotta to say it twice,
Cause I give her the kind of love that support the life.
Yeah I like to see my baby looking great,
That’s why I… and no single light!
Is she all talk about her ex-man?
Cause see, …on an ex-man.
I treat, I love her like gold,
…so I keep her on her toes!
My Shwaty ride to the air,
She…she keep a circle…
No rule, I’m concentrating hardly,
No prenup she respects the millions.
No…we decide to live in it,
And we love it, so we gonna buy it!
And when it ain’t a damn thing left,
Shwaty gonna love me to death!

[Bridge - Akon]
My Shwaty gonna love me

We gonna always be cool,
No matter what you say to her!
My Shawty gonna love me,
Cause you always stay true,
I’ma turn my back on you,
And she’ll kill for her lover,
I feel the same way about you, girl!
