[Verse 1:]
What's up with her?
She know she ain't right
Jeans don't fit her,
She got that kind of body that I like
Somebody's with her
But I don't see no man in sight
I'm tryin to get her
And I only need her for one night

[Chorus:]
So can I borrow that?
Hey girl can I borrow that?
Can I borrow that?
Would you let a nigga hold that?
Can I hold that? Can I hold that?
Hey girl can I hold that?
Can I? Can I hold that?
Can I? Would you let a nigga on that?
Can I?

[Verse 2:]
Let's go missy
I'm gonna need you by my side
I love the way you twerk it
I can see you on my floor tonight
No one around us,
So ain't nobody gonna be listenin'
No sleep till morning,
I have in the cab by 9 am

[Chorus:]
So can I borrow that?
Hey girl can I borrow that?
Can I borrow that?
Would you let a nigga hold that?
Can I hold that? Can I hold that?
Can I? Hey girl can I hold that?
Can I? Can I hold that?
Would you let a nigga on that?

[Verse 3:]
It's yo side, put yo hand where yo toes is
Hit in the kitchen where the stove is
Here's a hundred grand, Shawty you can hold this
Infant face, alright you think you all that
See a band got C's on it (Chanelle)
Set a trap for a rat, put cheese on it
White grill, white house, couple keys on it
Shawty so big, look not meat on it
Ah I'm a real street nigga (I am)
Say Shawty, she a real meat eater
I had her, her friend, in the 2 seater
Lynch mob, nobody, she a head keeper
Work

[Chorus:]
So can I borrow that?
Hey girl can I borrow that?
Can I borrow that?
Would you let a nigga hold that?
Can I hold that? Can I hold that?
Hey girl can I hold that?
Can I hold that?
Would you let a nigga on that?

[Outro:]
Can I hold that?
Girl can I hold that? Can I?
Baby girl can I hold that?
Oh can I hold that? Can I?
Baby girl can I hold that?
Can I hold that? Can I?
Baby girl can I hold that?
Oh girl can I hold that? Can
