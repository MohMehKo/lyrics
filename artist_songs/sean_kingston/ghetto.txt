Ooooooooooooooh
Ghetto Ghetto Ghetto Ghetto

[Chorus:]
I'm from the Motherfucking slums
Where the cops don't come
Turn the lights on and
The thugs don't run
You ain't shit without no gun
In the Ghetto (Ghetto) Ghetto (Ghetto)
[x2]

[Sean Kingston:]
I'm From the Ghetto
You ain't seen the slums
Till ya seen were I'm from
Everydays a homicide
Niggaz sleep with their gun
Fellaz running wrekcless
It's hectic
Their objectives
Holding niggaz down
They ain't trying to see us exit
I'm from the land of gun tookers
And weed smokers
Poverty is sickness
Plus them grew vicious
You don't want your juice
To be dripping on a late night
Buck 50 till ya feds light

[Chorus x2]

Those boiz got the corner popping
Hungry niggaz they corner hopping
Trying to get any way 2 fit in
Pop the trunk and it
Looks like a gun store
Fuck around killers kick in
Ya front door
Stop the bloodclut crying
Ring the alarm
And the slugs start flyin
And I tell that
People keep dying
What's the cost
Gas price to high
They ain't taking shorts

[Bridge:]
In the ghetto
Badman run wild
La la show times
Leak all those grids now
In The Ghetto
Them no response
Born a battyman
People jusa suffer yo
In the ghetto
Badman run wild
La la show times
Leak all those grids now
In The Ghetto
Them no response
Born a battyman
People jusa suffer yo

[Chorus]
