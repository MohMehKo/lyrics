Mommy just dry your eyes, mommy don't you cry
I know we've been through hard times and the struggles
And I just wanna tell you I love you

[Verse 1]
Only 15 put under pressure
First month 27th day,
They took away my mother
I was left to be raised by my brother
Taught to be a hustler
Mommy gone gotta stick together
Stay strong through the stormy weather
Became a top seller, look how we stacking this cheddar
When you jump mommy life would be better
Just like Rihanna you can stand under my umbrella

[Hook:]
You know how to make me better
Even when we lose our cheddar
Even through the stormy weather
You hold me down

[Chorus:]
Mommy just dry your eyes, mommy don't you cry
I know we've been through hard times and the struggles
And I just wanna tell you I love you
[x2]

[Verse 2]
17 got a little money
Feeling kinda blue
Cause it's looking like you doing 10 to 20
Riding being broke ain't funny
It's all being hungry
But I'm gonna keep hustling for my mommy
Until I get rich like puffy
Never had a plan 'B'
You said I can be all I can be
Some day I'm gonna buy you Miami
So when I win my Grammy
You coming cause I do this for my family

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
17 now my mommy's gone
Cant wait till she come back home
Missing her face like dust till dawn,while she went away
Never think it be so long
I feel like crying while I'm writing this song
Cant wait till that day come on
When she leave the place

[Speaking]
Hey whats up mom,how you doing?
Its been about 2 years since I saw your face
I miss you like crazy
Know the money orders the pre-paid costs
Being on my own
No Knee Kurt Canino
But I love you though
This for you

[Chorus]
