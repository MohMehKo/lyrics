What about me, yea
Oh what about you
What about all the things that we done gone and went through girl
Just forget bout it, get bout it (Cause i'm gone)
Just forget bout it, get bout it (Cause i'm gone)
So just forget bout it, get bout it (Cause i'm gone)
So just forget bout it, get bout it (Cause i'm gone)

Chu-chu-chu-chuckin up the deuces got me feelin like this
Reminiscing all the times we went through and it's sick
It hurts me, thinking bout it all again
It hurts me, i'm thinking bout it all again
Like damn, i don't think you understand
I just wanna be more than your average man
Please tell me where me and you stand
If not, i'll be gone til November like damn

What about me, yea
Oh what about you
What about all the things that we done gone and went through girl
Just forget bout it, get bout it (Cause i'm gone)
Just forget bout it, get bout it (Cause i'm gone)
So just forget bout it, get bout it (Cause i'm gone)
So just forget bout it, get bout it (Cause i'm gone)
