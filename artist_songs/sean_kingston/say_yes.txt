Girl, my name Kingston
Really nice to meet ya

where it's warm and sandy

So I just wanna let ya know

Girl nobody deserves your spot
even with the hips and the curves you got
lookin' at the way that you work

I say hey and you say no
what you expect with a body so cold?
Please tell me what you came here for
say you gotta man, but he ain't gotta know

Girl just say yes
If you wanna get him off your mind
[x2]

Your mind gonna race
In a million miles

And that's what I'm meanin' Now
Pone-ey I'll be somethin'

Money is no dilemma
Pushin' I'm just like dinner

I'm one and only
