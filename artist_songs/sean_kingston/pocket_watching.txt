Pocket watching on the sideline, popping at my door
Diamonds in my face, watch looking like a popo
Girl, you looking fine, tell me what you tryna do
Cause I got all the time for you, yeah yeah

If they ain't get in the door why the hell they talking?
We switch up the flow cause them niggas biting
I take off to Mars, yeah, we do that often
Wanna waste no time, baby girl, I am that guy
Tell them other niggas better stand in line
Bag a body if you play with mine

Pocket watching on the sideline, popping at my door
Diamonds in my face, watch looking like a popo
Girl, you looking fine, tell me what you tryna do
Cause I got all the time for you, yeah yeah

You a broke boy, that's a joke, boy
Walk, walk inside the club, tryna split a girl
Why you choke, boy? Do you smoke, boy?
You get no love, no
We got more bottles, more bottles
Rolling round my town, smoking loud

Pocket watching on the sideline, popping at my door
Diamonds in my face, watch looking like a popo
Girl, you looking fine, tell me what you tryna do
Cause I got all the time for you
Pocket watching on the sideline, popping at my door
Diamonds in my face, watch looking like a popo
Girl, you looking fine, tell me what you tryna do
Cause I got all the time for you, yeah yeah
