This goes out to all the rude girls on the dance floor
This is your boy Sean Kingston, you already know
Wat a gwaan

The way that you move make me fall in love
(Oh I, oh I, oh I)
Your sexy brown eyes, I can't get enough

Ooh girl, you got me thinking 'bout the island breeze
Them palm trees and kissin' underneath the moon
Oh baby girl, you need some water
Your body's gettin' hotter, the sweat drippin' off of you

Now break it down slow
Where I'm from girl that's how we do
So give me some more
You got the whole club watching you, you got me sayin'

You drop, drop, drop it like an island, girl
You pop, pop, pop it like an island, girl
You got, got, got it like them island, girls

I don't know where you're from
But you're dancin' to the drums like an island queen
You're dancin' like an island queen
Oh, you're such a pretty, pretty, little thing
Tonight you're my island queen
(Oh I)

Girl, you're royalty but what you doin' here without your king?
I don't know, I don't know
If it was up to me you'd be wearin' my diamond ring
(Ooh)

Come home with me, take you overseas
'Cause you move like that's where you belong
Picture us by the water, our bodies gettin' hotter
We'll be jammin' to the early morn

Now break it down slow
Where I'm from, girl, that's how we do
So give me some more
You got the whole club watching you
You got me sayin'

You drop, drop, drop it like an island, girl
You pop, pop, pop it like an island, girl
You got, got, got it like them island, girls

I don't know where you're from
But you're dancin' to the drums like an island queen
You're dancin' like an island queen
Oh, you're such a pretty pretty little thing
Tonight you're my island queen
(Oh, I)

If you're dancing with your queen
Fellas let me hear you sing
(Ooh, ooh)
If you're dancing with your king
Ladies let me hear you sing
(Ooh, ooh)

You take me to another place
When I watch ya move ya waist
Ooh girl, I'm falling in love
I don't know where you're from
Or when your dance to the drum
The whole club is watchin' you

You got me saying
You drop, drop, drop it like an island, girl
You pop, pop, pop it like an island, girl
You got, got, got it like them island, girls

I don't know where you're from
But you're dancin' to the drums like an island queen
You're dancin' like an island queen
Oh, you're such a pretty pretty little thing
Tonight you're my island queen
(Oh I)
