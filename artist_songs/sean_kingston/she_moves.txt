I ain't never met a girl like this anywhere before in my life eh
Body so blazin' man I can't believe my eyes eh
Oh yeah, she's my type, Louis Vuitton dress fit so right
Never thought a girl can me me feel this way eh

She's the king of girl that I wanna keep on my side eh
The way she walk in them heals got me tryin to get it started
Long hair, dark brown eyes, not turn the light we mesmorized

And this is something that got me (I be sayin)

[Chorus:]
We can get it on, to love with the dawn
The way you lick your lips girl you got me drawn
You on my mind, every day and night
The way that she move, the way that she talk
Got me so addicted she's the one for me
I know, she know, she's the one for me for me eh

She's the kind of girl that I can only find in my dreams eh
It must be the way her sexy body fit in dem jeans eh
Ay girl, you got me crazy, really wish I can call you baby
Who woulda thought that I would feel this way eh
Just come on closer so I can get to know ya
Your the one for me girl I already told ya
Oh yeah, I'm digging your hips, the way you move you dip by dip

And this is something got me (I be sayin)

[Chorus:]
We can get it on, to love with the dawn
The way you lick your lips girl you got me drawn
You on my mind, every day and night

The way that she move, the way that she talk
Got me so addicted she's the one for me
I know, she know, she's the one for me for me eh
