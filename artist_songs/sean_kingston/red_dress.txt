Kingston, Kingston, Kingston

[Chorus:]
I see them coming from afar
I got my eyes open I'm ready fi war
(Kingston)
Man a bad man, they know who we are
A Kingston mi come from, A Kingston mi come from
(Kingston)
I see them coming from afar
Dem dis Sean Kingston dem gonna get a scar
(Kingston)
Man a bad man, they know who we are
A Kingston mi come from, A Kingston mi come from

My mom is my hero
Two three nine zero
The doctor was looking at a star
From then I've been strictly on a mission
I got twenty-twenty vision
All the haters I can spot them from far
I'm Sean (Kingston)
Jamaicans on slash date
Nightly representin' and end up bring it home
Have dem sing my songs
I duck trouble but it keeps on breaking
Things going too well
The devil starts working
(Kingston)

I see them coming from afar
I got my eyes open, Tough luck for y'all,
Crush crush the war, I'm still a young boy
That drive all the grown folks right up the wall
(Kingston)
I'm aware of the snakes cause they're near
They plotting to get me, I'm watching my peers
My time in a million is close man I swear
I'm feeling it in the air and I'm more than prepared
And yeeaaaaah

[Chorus:]
I see them coming from afar
I got my eyes open I'm ready fi war
(Kingston)
Man a bad man, they know who we are
A Kingston mi come from, A Kingston mi come from
(Kingston)
I see them coming from afar
Dem dis Sean Kingston dem gonna get a scar
(Kingston)
Man a bad man, they know who we are
A Kingston mi come from, A Kingston mi come from

I went east, I met J.R., I became the bear
Spitting the big ticket, Number one on the track
Easy long, Ladies say he's the bomb
I ease the door, About to take the game by storm
(Kingston) The one and only
Haters got nothing on me
I can feel the vibe
And see it in their eyes
They're praying for my demise
They don't wanna see me blow yo
Rather see me low yo
Or happy on my floor yo but no-no
I'm a pull through this game of tug-a-war
What you fellas fussing for
Maybe cause I'm grubbing more
Nothing less than paying my dues
Don't hate me, A little hard work will get you there too
(Kingston)
I got next, better 'cause I got now
Everybody got faith and younging 'cause my hot style
86 to bull^^^^, they don't want me hot style
I'm a rain supreme until the day I drop down

[Chorus]

Dem a run off dem mouth and dem a run off dem beak
And dem a talk pon the block and dem a talk pon the streets
But dem don't wan' war with we,
'Cause we bus it and we pop it off, bus it and we pop it off

Dem a run off dem mouth and dem a run off dem beak
And dem a talk pon the block and dem a talk pon the streets
But dem don't wan' war with we,
'Cause we bus it and we pop it off, bus it and we pop it off

[Chorus]
