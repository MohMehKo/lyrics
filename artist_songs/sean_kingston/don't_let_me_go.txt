Yah man. Naww...
Remember those days when we use to be close
Life ain't the same how we use to be known
Out the window you letting everything go

I say my whole world use to be about you
Now it's kinda strange living life without you
I can't even think now we ain't anything now.

Yeah remember them days I was waiting in the rain
Accepted all my fairs and accepted all my pain
We were so close don't let it go nooo.

[Chorus:]
Don't let me go [x6]

I keep reminiscing how you use to be mine
No other women it was you on my mind
Can't replace it, all I can do is face it

See why would u leave me, you left me to be free.
I need you but we don't speak and I hardly see you.
We should work it out why you playing these games

You loved me back then but now everything changed
We were so close don't let it go no...

[Chorus:]
Don't let me go [x7]
