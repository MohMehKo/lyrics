Never thought that girl can dance so cool
The way you wind and move
Everybody looking upon you like "Woah! "
Oooooh

You got something that's so special
And I just want you to know
That I'm not going home without you
Nooooo

You got the body of a goddess
Little Mama you should roll with me
'Cause I'm the life of the party
Ask anybody about Sean King

You got the body of a goddess
Little Mama you should roll with me
'Cause I'm the life of the party

(Here We Goooo!)

Can't close my eyes, no words to say
But girl you got a body that's off the chain
Can't even lie, you brighten my day
And and everytime I see you I get my crave

Girl I'm addicted,
Addicted to the way you move
Girl I'm addicted
And I don't know what to do
Girl I'm addicted

Tell me I beg you for wind some more
Wind fast drop upon the floor
'Cause you'se a bad girl and that's for sure
Suuuuure

I think I'm losing my mind
'Cause girl you are so so fly
I will need you up in my life

You got the body of a goddess
Little Mama you should roll with me
'Cause I'm the life of the party
Ask anybody about Sean King

You got the body of a goddess
Little Mama you should roll with me
'Cause I'm the life of the party

Can't close my eyes, no words to say

Can't even lie, you brighten my day
And and everytime I see you I get my crave

Addicted to the way you move
Girl I'm addicted
And I don't know what to do

Girl the way you move make me really want ya
Many things you do make me really want ya
Girl the way you move make me really want ya

Eh! Oh! Eh!
