Ay' Yo Sean, You Mr. Kingston

[Pre-Chorus:]
Dutty,  dutty,  dutty love love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty,  dutty,  dutty love love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty,  dutty,  dutty love love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty,  dutty,  dutty love love

Don't be scared girl, call on me,
Cause me I'm a watcher from my eyes I'm a lover, you see,
And the way you are wind and the way you are grind,
Said no matter how much I feel rushed, yeah like that red won't stop (yo)
But baby girl will you be mine,
Let Go, show your skin because you're one of a kind,
And I'm alive, girl I must be in love,
Cause the way you are grindin' off my car top,

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus:]
What if you would just come right out of these clothes?
You can finally feel the wind when it blows,
Don't be scared to be free, to let go, show it off,
Feel like letting go,
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm here and and you might not like,
Cos you need Sean King in your life (Call)
King I'm a man and a man can't change,
And if I come over there's a girl lock up with em' limbs, (Yo)
I feel like letting go,
If you never know, baby, now you know,
Cause you’re one of a kind, and you dress so fine,
Like my diamond in a chain, you shine so bright, oh,

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Ay' Yo Sean, You Mr. Kingston,
You say you have it, Louie it and then some,
Look how you grinding on all your ice
You pretty and you nice,
You done want Nicki as your wife,
But you say, I’ll be up where you stay,
I ain't like them other bitches that will be actin' loosely,
Know you gettin' hyper, I know you wanna get up in it,
But I just wanna think about it for another minute,
I think I like your style you all,
Why ya'll,
Why don't we let go,
Ay yo’,
And I ain't gotta tell 'em,
And I ain't gotta sell 'em,
It's YSL,
Teddy, I ain't gotta spell it,
And yes, I killer kill 'em,
I guess I am the Villain,
I park on the curb, I'm the owner of the building (the building),
Ya deaf?
Boy me soon left,
Come get this playboy bunny like Hugh heph,
Sigh, rastafari,
Dutty,  dutty d-d-d,  dutty,

[Chorus]

Feel like letting go
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Feel like letting go (lighter)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
