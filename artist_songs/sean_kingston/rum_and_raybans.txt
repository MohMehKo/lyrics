Kingston,
Let's go!!

Round of applause because the body needs a hand
Clap it up for that body
Clap it up for that body
Shots at the bar no chases baby, I'm a man
Take a shot of Bacardi
Take a shot of Bacardi.

Can't drive home cause I'm way too drunk so bailareeee!
Eight fingers on, got drink in my cup so bailareeee!
Throw up, and I don’t give a fuck so bailareeee!
Throw up and I don’t give a fuck
Throw up and I don’t give a fuck
I pull up in a matte black truck like a rock star feeling like a million bucks
Shades on, drink in my hand and the only thing I need is
Rum and Raybans!

Rum and Raybans
Rum and Raybans

Round of applause because the body needs a hand
Clap it up for that body,
Clap it up for that body
No really baby, like it touch it if I can
Why don't we leave the party and we can get real naughty
Can't drive home cause I'm way too drunk so bailareeee!
Eight fingers on, got drink in my cup so bailareeee!
Throw up, and I don’t give a fuck so bailareeee!
Throw up and I don’t give a fuck
Throw up and I don’t give a fuck

I pull up in a matte-black truck like a rock star feeling like a million bucks
Shades on, drink in my hand and the only thing I need is
Rum and Raybans!

We can dance all night long until the morn'
With nothing but our shades on.
