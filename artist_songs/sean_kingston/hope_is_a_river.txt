[Sean Kingston]
Hope is a river, a stream of
Casting your fears away, the sky

[B.o.B]
Shouts out to the underdogs who
Put their favorite artists on the walls and
Can never get enough of one song
So it plays and it plays all day long
Cause all the pain outside they don’t wanna see
So they write songs constantly
Cause a doctor or a lawyer they don’t wanna be
And I ask do you really have grow up just to be what you wanna be?
So shouts out to the mc’s and the divas and the singers and the prom queens
And the folks who don’t ever get invited to the party
But somehow be the first on the scene
To the folks who just wanna be free
Fuck all of that YouTube, young, you can’t see
Ask them when’s the last time they had a dream
Cause every river leads to the sea, to the sea

[Sean Kingston]
Hope is a river that runs wider, a stream of floating desires
Casting your fears away, as it float above the skies, the skies
Where your worries will drown out
You imagine how it would be right now
Casting your fears away as it float above the skies, the skies
Hope is a river (hope is a river, hope is a river)
Hope is a river (hope is a river, hope is a river)
Hope is a river, of dreams run free, so be real, real, real, to be real

And I pray for the good days, for the world to be a better place
Cause I know one day, be a better way, everyone could have a getaway
Where we go into a place where there’s love in hearts now, hearts now, hearts now
And I know that one day will be away from the gun play
Cause somehow all the pain got a soon change
Take away all the pain and the hate til its love now
The world needs a big change and we need it right now

Casting your fears away as it float above the skies, the skies
Hope is a river (hope is a river, hope is a river)
Hope is a river (hope is a river, hope is a river)
Hope is a river, of dreams run free, so be real, real, real, to be real
