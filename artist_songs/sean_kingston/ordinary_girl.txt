It felt great when I met you, something to remember
Body looking right, cool like in December
We should take a flight, one way wherever
'Cause your eyes take me away

You're like an angel in the sky, you got wings
When you arrive it's like a midnight dream
And I can't lie, you got that tease
And shorty please don't walk away

Girl, you're different from the girls I see
Diamond in the rough, your smile takes me away
So many girls, it's hard for me to choose
No matter where you go I'm stuck on you

Oh, it's so hard to look away
'Cause you're no ordinary girl
She got that thing, you can't deny
Something about your aura says
That you're no ordinary girl
Exceptional, one of a kind

And when we wake up in the morning and we look outside
It was the same every day after you walked by
She ain't an ordinary girl, not an ordinary girl

Girl you are the one, I can tell by over
Girl, you shine bright, brighter than my nightlight
