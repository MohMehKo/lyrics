[Intro]
Hey Yo J.R
I meet A lot of Beautiful girls in my life man
But this situation is kinda weird
I like her sister

[Verse 1]
I was just walking out school
I saw this girl gettin off the train
We exchanged numbers and went on a couple dates
At first everything was cool
Until I meet her sister Lorraine
Got introduced to each other and then everything changed

[Bridge:]
I wanted a piece of that forbidden fruit
But my homies said to stay away
But I'm 17 what you expect me to do
I guess we'll charge it as a part of the game

[Chorus (x2):]
If I'm wrong oh I don't want to be right
I kissed your sister last night
It ain't my fault
I guess your sister's my type

[Verse 2]
Now I'm on the telephone talking
With Lorraine but her sisters on the other line
But I can't help my self Cause Lorraine too fine
And I know this may be wrong but it feels so right
Her sister is nice but Lorraine is more like sugar and spice

[Bridge]

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3]
Sorry that it had to go like this way
But you know your sisters got what I need
Cause I got to be with Lorraine
And I'm over you

Sorry that it had to go like this way
But you know your sisters got what I need
Cause I got to be with Lorraine
And I'm over you (Over you)

[Bridge]

[Chorus x2]
