Give me an ice cream 
Girl for the weekend 
Kind of girl she built for any season 
For the winter...for the fall 
Even in the summer...time is no fall 
You wanna a ice cream 
Girl for the weekend 
A pocket full of dough you wanna blow on the weekend 
Young fresh and clean...you know what I mean 
Everybody knows the female that loves the ice cream 

My rum raisin...she drunk in the club 
She 
She got a man...he's always cheating 
N her daddy left her when she was 18 

Ride here ride her...she the life of the party 
She in that of the limosine...look like someone from a magazine 
She such a beauty queen...got me spending all my cream

Frosty oh where u at?

Looked like something from a magazine
