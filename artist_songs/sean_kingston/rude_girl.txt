[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
Come here rude girl, girl
Can you get it up
Come here rude girl, girl
Can I get a touch
Shake it, shake it
Baby, baby
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, for me
[repeat]

[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
Want a boy from the West Indies
Sean Kingston I'm him, that will be me
Introduce you to stuff you will never see
Cause I will take you around the world in a first class seat
Money ain't a thing when I'm around
Jay-Z and Rihanna can run this town
I'm a real young man so I can put it down
Down Down
I learned a lot coming from that corner
Now I'm in the game
I can say what I want
You can tell with my guard I am a grown up
So baby stop playin, and just come over
Eh eh...

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
Come here rude girl, girl
Can you get it up
Come here rude girl, girl
Can I get a touch
Shake it, shake it
Baby, baby
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, for me
[repeat]

[Verse 2: Sean Kingston]
Baby, show me were I'm at on your list
You can show me how to ride on your [? ]
(Eh Eh)
It's Sean King you know the name, I'm spitting all the flames
Money ain't a thing when it comes to the cause yo
Pull out my [? ] looking like a car show
Bentley, Fanto, even Murcielago
Think I can't rap
I'll tell them what they need to know.
This right is my swag, that's the kind of swag that them boys wish they had
In the mall we doing it like fat
Tellin them chicks to run around and throw it in their bag

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
Come here rude girl, girl
Can you get it up
Come here rude girl, girl
Can I get a touch
Shake it, shake it
Baby, baby
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, for me
[repeat]

[Verse 2: Detail]
You say you like it rude
So I'm give it to you
You like to talk (ah ah)
I'm talking to you
I can talk to you all night long
Girl you know it's real cause you hear it in my tone
You like it when I'm dirty with it
Till 6 in the morning
Call it early with it
You can come to my world
No [?]
You never talk about
You just hop in the bed and get the best about it
You like to breathe hard
There is no screaming
Cause your Rude Girl
Sean Kingston

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
Come here rude girl, girl
Can you get it up
Come here rude girl, girl
Can I get a touch
Shake it, shake it
Baby, baby
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, for me
[repeat]

Shake it, for me

Shake it, shake it
Shake it, for me
