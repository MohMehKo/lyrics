Everythin' I have done up to this point has been for today
And now this is tomorrow
We all tryin' to make it to tomorrow
'Cause we don't know what tomorrow holds

So I'mma get to you across the world
Don't worry 'cause it's only a day away
So all my people struggling', making something out of nothin'
Just relax and pray 'cause it's only one day away

Tomorrow
I'm finally comin' home tomorrow
I just gotta get through today
But hey, what's one more day to wait?
