[Verse 1:]
Do 100 on the freeway
With no seatbelt on tryna get away
But I keep going back to love
Even when you ain't next to me
You're the only one still in my memory
It's like my heart won't let up
So baby here I am

[Pre-Chorus:]
I'm on my way, I'm on my way oh
I'm on my way, girl to your arms
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Girl to your arms
And all I want is you

[Chorus:]
When I miss my baby
I can barely breathe
Do it all, I want you next to me
'Cus you're love's like ecstasy
Girl I want you closer
It's the only drug I need
Even your doctor said to stay away
But you're love like ecstasy

Oh no, your love like ecstasy
Oh no, your love like ecstasy

[Verse 2:]
Even when you ain't right at times
Girl you still find a way to stay on my mind
It's like with you I can't wait at all
Ooh no

If loving you was a dead crime
I'd be locked up, doing 20 to life
So much emotions build inside
So baby here I am

[Pre-Chorus:]
I'm on my way, I'm on my way oh
I'm on my way, girl to your arms
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Girl to your arms
And all I want is you

[Chorus:]
When I miss my baby
I can barely breathe
Do it all, I want you next to me
'Cus you're love's like ecstasy
Girl I want you closer
It's the only drug I need
Even your doctor said to stay away
But you're love like ecstasy

[Bridge:]
Ever since a boy I gotta have a steady Shawty
If I could run like your love I'll smoke always
And I'll never get dry like the supply
Girl you got me
I need a hit of you so I can start my day
I'm an addict, we handcut it certainly
And I don't care what the haters say
'Cus...

[Pre-Chorus:]
I'm on my way, I'm on my way oh
I'm on my way, girl to your arms
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Girl to your arms
And all I want is you

[Chorus: x2]
When I miss my baby
I can barely breathe
Do it all, I want you next to me
'Cus you're love's like ecstasy
Girl I want you closer
It's the only drug I need
Even your doctor said to stay away
But you're love like ecstasy

Oh no, your love like ecstasy
Oh no, your love like ecstasy
