I’ll know soon if it’s the cold hard truth
That all I have wagered I could lose
All but you
I’ll know soon if it’s the chance to prove
That all I have gained is worth it’s due
All but you
I will carry all the weight, carry all the weight
Hold you in my arms. I won’t let you fall. I won’t let you faint
I will carry all the weight, carry all the weight
Hold you in my arms. I won’t let you break
I’ll know soon if it’s a win I’ll have proof
That all I have wagered will come true
Holding you
