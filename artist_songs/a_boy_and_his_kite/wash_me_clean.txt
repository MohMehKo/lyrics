Wash me clean
In the warm sun dry me
Cleanse my heart
From all iniquity
Baptize me
In the holy spirit sea
Renew my mind
That wickedness may flee
Restore my soul
Holy spirit take hold
Bath me in your peace. Let it flow
Grant me hope
In the dark have your light shown
Sing your love
The sweetest song I’ve ever known
Barren fields will sprout trees
Deaf and blind will hear and see
Dead will raise and begin to breathe
Earth groan’s in pain to see
Sons of God declare to be
The full and glorious family
