Heartache is a cold place
When winter was my birthplace
Alone, I can only run
Sorrow is a freed space
When tears have a good taste
And dry in the heat of the sun
Glory is my weakness
When all I wants to seek it
To see that bright light shine
Failures are for reasons
My pride is left conceding
In loss, all the glory is mine
Pain, its more than just a fight
It breaks and builds my might
Faith, man it’s more than just my words
It bends my soul to turn
Hope it’s more than just my pleas
It’s a light I choose to see
Love, man it’s more than just a state
It’s a true and selfless place
Lonely is a cold place
When laughter is a mute case
And my breath is all i hear
Emptiness is bottomless
When all i pour is hopelessness
Alone, I can only fear
Trying is a helpless plea
If giving up is all I need
To feel my days are done
Righteousness is meaningless
If suffering can steal its bliss
And joy goes down with the sun
I’m not giving up, I’m not giving up on this life
I’m not giving up, I’m not giving up on this fight
