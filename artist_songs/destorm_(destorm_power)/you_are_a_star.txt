[DeStorm Power]
Yeah
This' for all my stars out there
Starts burn forever so...
I want y'all to keep shinnin'
C'mon!
Yeah!

[DeStorm Power]
For the last 7 years, 6 months, 5 weeks, 4 days, 3 hours, 2 minutes
Every second you've been in it
Take it back to the beginning when nobody believed
In your vision or you livin' this impossible dream
What they fail to realize is when you're against all odds
That comin' from the bottom ain't as hard as it seems
Remember winners take chances
And losers never choose
And those who get a jump start rarely ever lose

[DeStorm Power]
Now give me more energy
I need more energy
Let 'em hate
Time to make 
Doubt your worst enemy
Go and let 'em judge you
They ain't on the jury though
Drop the gravel on 'em
Tell 'em now my leaders here it goes

[The Arnats]
Every little place you go
Girl, they gonna hate, gonna hate
Every little thing you do
They will try to destroy you 'cause
'Cause you are a star
And they know it baby
'Cause you are a star
You should know it baby

[DeStorm Power]
Your relationship it got a bit bumpy
Complain about the time spent arguin' about money
He was stingy but you love to share
Like you married sonny
Now he calls you bees and all other mother bitches honey
Ain't it funny how the tables turn?
And on that very day you learn
If you ever buy a book make certain the pages turn
And we know time heals
but some hills are steep
New relationship's a baby step so look before you leap

[DeStorm Power]
Now give it more energy
I need more energy
Let 'em hate
Time to make 
Doubt your worst enemy
Go and let 'em judge you
They ain't on the jury though
Drop the gravel on 'em
Tell 'em now my leaders here it goes

[The Arnats]
Every little place you go
Girl, they gonna hate, gonna hate
Every little thing you do
They will try to destroy you 'cause
'Cause you are a star
And they know it baby
'Cause you are a star
You should know it baby

[DeStorm Power]
It's your last day at work with no decision of yours
And now that dream in that Beam is just a vision of yours
Save for two years but two weeks
Livin' the broad
Now you regretting all the things that you've been giving them broads
Collision course and you mad at it
Now you got these bad habits
Missing work so much you turn around and look back at it
You know you ain't bad at it
Take another stab at it
Breathing down you neck
It's time to take that breath like asthmatics

[DeStorm Power]
More energy
I need more energy
Let 'em hate
Time to make 
Doubt your worst enemy
Go and let 'em judge you
They ain't on the jury though
Drop the gravel on 'em
Tell 'em now my leaders here it goes

[The Arnats]
Every little place you go (every place you go)
Girl, they gonna hate, gonna hate (common)
Every little thing you do 
They will try to destroy you 'cause (they gone try to destroy you)
'Cause you are a star (but you know you're a star, right)
And they know it baby (they know it)
'Cause you are a star (yeah)
You should know it baby (you better believe it baby)

[The Arnats]
Every little place you go
Every little thing you do
'Cause you are a star (you better believe it baby)
