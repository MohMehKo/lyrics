[Intro:]
I'm stuck in the friend zone
And it's sad cause
I rather live this lie
Than not have you in my life at all

[Verse 1:]
Never thought playing background could be so hard
Wish I cast for the lead and got the SAG card?
Course the sad part is you don't even know about it
Wanna confess but how I'm goin' go about it?
You say ya'll argue and fight now?
You at my place in my arms on my couch now
Saying I'm the best friend that you got now
So I cover my emotions like some white out
I know you love to talk about him
But it hurts when you talk about him
And you say the three of us should just meet
But I claim that I'm too busy
Girl cause you be spending hours at my place
And every time you get close to my face
I swear I wanna claim your lips as mine
And share all these feelings I'm forced to hide

[Hook:]
Girl
I can't do this, no
I can't do this, no
I can't do this, no
I can't do this
So I just chill here in the background, yeah
And the sad part is
I'll take what we have over
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

[Verse 2:]
You telling me you confide in me
If only I could show the other side of me
I wanna be more than your best friend
Wish that I can get this nightmare to end
It's your five month anniversary
Upset cause I'm six months too late
Wish I was the one that met you first
As time goes on it just gets worse

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
There's a party at Barney's a couple of my friends goin'
I was busy putting my number in your friend's phone
Then you took my focus like I put a lens on
I fell in lust with your eyes and your skin tone
Then I told you you're a catch, fuckin' endzone
A week goes by and I'm thinking, "It's on"
You confess you have a man and you're into 'em
Damn, how I end up in the friend zone
The more I like you the more you want to chill
If I play my cards right maybe I can deal (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But I'mma keep it real
I can never be a friend of his as long as you a friend of me (uh uh)
And if I tell you that I'm in to you would that make us enemies? (huh huh)

[Hook x2]
