[Hook: DeStorm]
...And anybody trying to tell me I'm not, watch me!
And anybody trying to step in my spot, watch me!
Said, if you ever doubt that I'm hot, watch me!
Then you can get the finger...
What finger? - The middle!

[Verse: Razi]
Check it!
My life story is in comparison to the road of glory
I was unaccepted, always picked last
Outcast rap, never fit the "in" crowd
Never been loud, wasn't allowed to get down, sound of crickets
I just sat around and looked at my spittin' image
A reflection of imperfection, a rejection of human complexion
I made mistakes but forget all the decisions I made
My mental stability was making me afraid
Hoping that one day, I'm satisfied at how far I'm coming along
Going wrong to right, then right to wrong
But a wise man then told me life is mostly froth and bubble,
And one thing that stands like stone, motivation under your trouble
Learned lessons, i practiced to make perfections
Music is now the message, forget the criticism
My mind is speaking though the rhythm
No longer trapped in this rectangular prism
From the ground to the sky as i rise to my feet
Seeing visions of life that people fail to exceed.

[Hook: DeStorm]
I'm so hot, I'm so hot, I'm so hot, I'm so hot,
I'm so hot, I'm so hot, I'm so hot, I'm so hot...
