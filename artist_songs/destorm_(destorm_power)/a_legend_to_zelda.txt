[Intro:]
Everyday a legend is born
Some get the recognition
Most won't
Does that mean we stop what we do?
Hell no!

[Verse 1:]
Yeah, you mean to tell me that
All I gotta do is part a little water
Turn it into wine and give it to the daughters
Write a few scripts, yeah, a new world order
A new constitution, connect a few borders
Learned from the forefathers
Never follow orders
While you sit on the corner I'll sit on the quarter
You put me on the copper coin and I'm a turn my back to you
Waking up the masses, yes, is something I was born to do
And I won't stop 'til I'm a legend like The Fresh Prince
Fuck being a star, give me the folks with the most sense
We'll start to congregating
You can call us constellations
Dropping beams of light to all you dark spots across the nation

[Hook:]
A little more grind, and I will be a legend
A couple more rhymes, and I will be a legend
I'm ahead of my time so, I will be a legend
I will be a legend, I will be a legend
To everyone who doubted me, I will be a legend
A hero, a prodigy, I will be a legend
No question I gotta be, gotta be a legend
A legend, a legend, uh, uh, a legend
One day

[Verse 2:]
Now everybody wondering how to be a legend
Praying to their deacons and their local reverends
But they don't have the answers, they barely have the questions
Here's a simple question, take is as a lesson
Why the poorest people pray the most?
Poorest people work the most
Ladies with the holey shoes always catch the Holy Ghost
You think them starving kids care about your light bills?
Niggas with life in jail don't care about tight wheels
They just surviving, trying to stay alive
In a society that let them down while you steady crying
Stop all your complaining, it's time to be a legend
It's time to get presents for your presence
Peasants

[Hook]

[Outro:]
They checking me in history
Everybody came just to see
I'm no longer a mystery
I'm a legend, a legend
Uh, uh, a legend
