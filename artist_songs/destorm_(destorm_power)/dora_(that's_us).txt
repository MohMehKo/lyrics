[Ad lib:]
Did this nigga just sample Dora?

[Verse 1:]
Yo, it's a celebration because finally a nigga on
A bigger budget so I'm gonna bring you bigger songs
I'm in the booth like
(Gotta save Metropolis!)
I'm in the coupe like
(Bitch you know you want this choocolate!)

New habits I want it then I'm coppin' it
Silly rabbits you wanted Papa Doc to win
Heart breaker, Harlem shaker
Couldn't copy the flow if you had carbon paper

I raised hoes that ain't worth a dime
Choice told me find a lady that's worthy of my time
Cause time don't return once it fly away
And the Delorean is parked in the driveway

Every year a different cribbo to stay on my toes
I do these mufuckin' videos to stay on my flows (yeah)
I'm bringing hits nigga, fight club
If you step into the ring, bring the right gloves

I don't go out much, party and such
Cause history ain't made in the night club
But when I do, I make sure I bring the house down
A couple bottles, models on the couch now

Now who the nigga who the nigga standing out now
Who the nigga who the nigga standing out now
And this one for my bad bitches getting hated on
Pour the drink in your cup girl and sing along

[Hook:]
Who dat is standing over there
Middle finger in the air like they don't care?
That's us, that's us, that's us
That's us, that's us, that's us, that's us

And who them niggas just rolled up
Everybody hatin' on em', Hold up!
That's us, that's us, that's us
That's us, that's us, that's us, that's us

It's the same crew and the same team
With some brand new bills and some brand new things
That's us, that's us, that's us
That's us, that's us, that's us, that's us

[Verse 2:]
Yo, you know you made it when
You rippin' over tracks for the kiddies
And the VIP's packed full of biddies
Stacks full of fifties, cab from the city
Spoil her in the valley, send her back to the city

Never call her back cause I'm picky
Told that bitch to have a little faith
Like I'm Biggie, yeeeeah
Heart breaker, Harlem shaker
Couldn't copy the flow if you had carbon paper

Nice kicks, fly gear, tight whip, it's my year

I see you over there looking at me
With your looking ass you ain't winning like me so
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, no I don't give a fuck

I'm bringing hits nigga, fight club
If you step into the ring, bring the right gloves
I don't go out much, party and such
Cause history ain't made in the night club

But when I do I make sure I bring the house down
A couple bottles, models on the couch now
Now who the nigga who the nigga standing out now
Who the nigga who the nigga standing out now

And we don't give a fuck if you don't get us
All my real friends is right here with us

[Hook]
