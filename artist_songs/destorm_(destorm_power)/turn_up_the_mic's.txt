[Intro:]
Turn up the mics
Make 'em extra bright
If we goin' do this ish
Man we better do it right
Turn up the mics
Make 'em extra bright
If we goin' do this ish
Man we better do it right

[Hook:]
Turn up the mics and hear 'em baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to hear this
Turn up the mics and hear 'em baby
You know what I mean
Want you to hear everything
Why don't you turn up the mics?

[Verse 1:]
Figure I could make it
If I can run from Five-O
I can run for my goals
This is my survival
And ain't no stopping me
Trying to put the drop on me
I told you niggas I would be
At the top, on the drop
And that's right up on the hill
Soon as you make it out
Haters claiming you ain't real
Hold up
I'm so high
I can touch the sky
I ain't coming down
I finally know that I can fly

[Verse 2:]
I grind it out
Blew up the channel
Still rock the Yankee
Mickey Mantle
Now I'm in Hollywood where everything is finally good
Here to make the Earth shake and
Living here I probably could
Don't be mad I'm out the hood
I'm still shouting out the hood
Shout out to my people
Though I valet park and drop the hood
Now that I've obtained some wealth
I can only thank myself
Running from that 6 by 8
Never again will I shame myself

[Hook]
