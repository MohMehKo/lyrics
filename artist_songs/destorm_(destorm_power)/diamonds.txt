[Intro:]
(Shine bright like a diamond)
Obama's back
Got me feeling proud
Cause my president is black
Two Terms!

[Verse:]
Look up in the sky
It's a bird, it's a plane
Only we decide if the world's gonna change
Ain't gotta take the lame
But you goin' take the shame
In a whole free world, know exactly who to blame
Hit them polls like a stripper
Put our ballots in
FOX News hate to see them niggas rally in
Calling all my white people
Calling all my Asians
Gather my Latinos
We win in every race
And we learn, when the group burn, you burn
We stuck together, now we're screaming out, "Two Terms"
That's our motherfucking motto
Making plans looking forward to tomorrow
Now they're screaming mercy, Murcielago
Living that high life, Colorado
Sick of all the hating, all the drama Mary sending up
Bush got eight to fuck up
We gave Obama eight to clean it up

[Hook:]
So shine bright
Tonight
You and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond [x8]
