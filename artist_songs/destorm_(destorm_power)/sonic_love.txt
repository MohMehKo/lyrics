[Intro:]
Green Hill Zone
Come on!

[Hook: x2]
Girl, you so fly girl
Swear one day I'm a make you my girl
Take you around the world on a mile high, girl
Charts to the game
Our limit is the sky, girl

[Verse 1:]
Met the girl in the 8th grade
Back then I had the high top fade
Fresh Converse and a mean pair of shades
Thinkin' about kissing while I'm worried about gettin' laid
Bumming cash from my Mom for the arcade
Only argument is "What we goin' play?"
And we play
All day
You beat me at Pac-Man 3 (Unngh)
Now we getting a little older
Feels like the world is getting a little colder
Feels like you're giving me the cold shoulder
Now I'm trying to find a way that I can hold on (yup)
You said you going away to college
I never was one to try and cock block knowledge
My feelings so solid
I had to ask, "Why girl?"
Thought one day that I could make you my girl

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I remember back then I used to pull out your chair
Play a little R. Kelly up in your ear
We used to hit the park
We used to hit the mall
When you was witchu' girls
I was playin' ball
I will keep it real witchu'
You will keep it real with me
Promise when we grow up
That we both still would be
In love
We ain't in love no mo'
We both moved on and that's how the story goes

[Outro:]
Yeah, this a dedication to everybody who had that first love
You feel so strong about it when you young, right?
You like, "I'm gonna get that girl"
Ain't nothing like young love
