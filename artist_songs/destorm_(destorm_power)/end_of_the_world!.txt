[Intro: Destorm]
Yeah
Ha
Owen L jr
I think the worlds coming to an end ya'll

[Verse 1: Destorm]
Paranoid, I need some facts that I feel destroyed
The damn rumor's that the worlds gonna' be destroyed
What you talking 'bout? you know what I'm talking 'bout
7 billion body's on the ground now chalk 'em out
Looking out my window, begin to wonder
Hear that roar coming for us, hear that thunder
Where am I gonna go? I just can't run no more
I'm checking on my neighbors, they boarding up their windows
But it ain't gonna help if the world gon' endo
I tired of looking out my blinds
It's only a matter of time

[Hook: Destorm]
But if the world gonna end, then I'm going in
But if the world gonna end, then I'm going in
Ain't' nowhere to run
Ain't' nowhere to hide
Pack ya things away
It's the end of time
But if the world gonna end, then I'm going in
But if the world gonna end, then I'm going in
Ain't' nowhere to run
Ain't' nowhere to hide
Pack ya things away
It's the end of time

[Verse 2: destorm]
Hands open, hands together
Who do you belive in?
And will he hear ya prayers?
Are they coming true this evening?
Afraid to lose the cars
Afraid to lose the house
Afraid to loose the family
Afraid to lose the spouse
I'm calling all my friends
I don't wanna' go alone
No more power in the house
No reception on the phone
Go back to my window
Everybody's running
All again it's coming
I can't see the sun anymore
Ohh
Am I gonna die?
Lord please teach me to fly
So I
Can run away
To the moon (yeah)
