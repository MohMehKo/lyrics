[Intro:]
It's like you walk up in the spot and uh
They see you coming
You ain't got to say a word
Oh oh you scatting on them

[Verse 1: DeStorm]
Girl, the way you put together
Makes it hard not to stare
If God accepted you in heaven
I'd say your looks go you there
Oooh I'm superficial but you still smirk
Just shows simple compliments but yet they still work
Spend them hours in the mirror
Go and pick your favorite shoes
You turning up tonight, girl
Make your haters lose
Make them players fill your shot glass
Make them pay their dues
Go and break the liqurios
Shake your ass in swimming pools
While the hood chicks lose scream out "bad bitches rule"
And I see you standing there hope you ain't got no man in here
These niggas on you like the Nina, Pinta, Santa Maria
And all that ass I can see it from here
You scatting on them

[Hook: Kreesha Turner]
We got the flashing, baby

Cause everywhere that we gon' go
They gonna see that I'm so fresh and difficult
Cause I know that we gon' show

About to go platinum on them
Etterbay inday ouyay

No comprende? you wait
Kreesha Turner warn them
Like a pair of stockings
Yeah, we just ran up on them
In a different state of mind
You can call it California
Baddest chicks be on my nuts
I'm not a bra but I support them
Them Louis Hills, I bought them
She's excited, opposite of boredom
Like an orange [?] I ain't got to court them
Treat them like laundry
Learn how to sort them

Smelling like success
Looking like a photo
20 on the chest
Bruce [?]

[Hook]
