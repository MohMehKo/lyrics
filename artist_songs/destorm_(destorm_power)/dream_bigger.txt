[Intro:]
Yeah, uh, yo
Dream bigger
Dream bigger
Dream bigger
You got to dream bigger
Dream bigger
Dream bigger
Dream bigger, bigger
Got to dream bigger

[Verse 1:]
Y'all niggas too modest
Making plans like you don't know who God is
You praying for that one room apartment
While Walle-Wall cop it, nigga just stop it
Well maybe I can live close to a market
Little dog barking, garage I can park in
Now you browse Craigslist for the car of your dreams
But you can't cop a bean, the job of a teen
The kids in school but they failing the grade
And giving them A's but you giving them J's
If anybody ask what you got in the bank
You say, "I only get checking only Jesus can save"

[Hook:]
If I can just get through to my people, uh uh uh
I tell 'em if you want to be equal, uh uh
You got to dream bigger
Dream bigger
Dream bigger
You got to dream bigger
Dream bigger
Dream bigger
Dream bigger
Niggas got to dream bigger

[Verse 2:]
How you afford to live?
And tell me how your car cost more than your crib
I guess you really don't know what doing it is
Waiting on your taxes for clothes for the kids
Got a new flat screen but can't open the fridge
And you got some new bills and you got some new fears
But you headed to the mall going to get some new gear, hah
Now you broke and you going through hell again
Nigga I'm hella bent
Ain't no telling when you goin' see the light like it's too much melanin
One day you goin' learn like college
Too many of y'all gas but you got no mileage

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
I know I'm goin' regret it
But I'm going hard tonight
Cause I just want to live that flashy life, ohh
And everybody wants that flashy life, ohh
And I know I'm goin' regret it
But I bought two chains tonight
Cause I just want to live that flashy life, ohh
And everybody wants that flashy life, yeah
Ohhh ohh oh oh ohh

[Hook]
