[Tyler Ward:]
A toast to everyone who said we won't
Make it out, only a little hope
We at the party, the life of the party
Now we bump glass
Now we bump glass

[Eppic:]
Now...
Screams getting heavy, cause thing's unpreventable
Evidently you saw the ship riding to my distress signal
Confidence causing the glass around me to rupture
[?] suddenly looking in the eyes of Heath Ledger
[?]
But probably substantial, well that meant ingenuity's well sharpened
But not as neglected, either way, maneuvers well executed
Mind of I with an intricate twist, graduated from a student
Played a deck, consisted of only clubs, diamonds, and spades
Like to see someone interpret that meaning
Cause even now you're nowhere near being someone that's anything special
But apparently I'm a lunatic having rhymes with reasoning
That's got me getting quite methodical with my rhyme scheme
As though I'm getting eloquent
Now the sign of fraudulents reflected with a work ethic a surgeon couldn't even extract
So with it raise glass, I'm down to raise a toast to that

[Hook - Tyler Ward:]
Now we bump glass
A toast to everyone who said we won't
Make it out, only a little hope
We at the party, the life of the party
Sharing these laughs
Now we bump glass
A toast to all my haters
A toast to all my lovers
We at the party, the life of the party
Sharing these laughs
Now we bump glass

[DeStorm:]
We bump glasses, yeah we bump glasses
Shout out to the fact I finally know what real cash is
Remember the days when I depended on my taxes
Every day was Ramadan, now they gone fastin'
Everybody coming for my spot right now
But there's no more space in the parking lot right now!
Guess you need a bigger bus, take a shot right now
But you could be my fanboy, cause I'm hot right now
Doc, I'm stuck with this cold
Sick rhymes, ill flow
Ain't gotta like me but you gon' respect the skill though
Three years ago I introduced you to a real flow
And now I'm droppin' singles comin' for the Billbo'
You follow yellow bricks, I follow railroads
With brown and yellow chicks
My life's so real, whoa!
I can't slow down now, or unfasten the
Seatbelts, we done set the flux capacitor
All these opportunities, how we gon' pass 'em up
We sharing laughs now, bumpin' these glasses up
