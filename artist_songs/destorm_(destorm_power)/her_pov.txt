[Verse 1]
Baby take a sit here, how'd we even get here?
These lies eventually tire, and you promised me a good year
You telling' me I'm so bad, spitting that game all in my good ear
Claiming we gon' build something together huh? (IKEA)
In the beginning we were winning, I called you up and you'd be down
For whatever, whenever and now you never be around
Treat me like a polka dot cuz I'm spotting now
Used to text for the sex when my visitors in town, but now?
All we do is yell and fight and why I gotta touch myself at night
Got the nerve to come home smelling like, booty
Let me tell it right
(There ain't no other chick)
Fuck that bitch and I ain't even the jealous type
Is that the same ho that you met on Skype?
Or down in Brooklawn with your friends that night?
Why am I so tight? I'm just real
But why you buying helmets if you ain't playing the field?

[Hook]
If I would have known then everything I know now
We'd be making up, shit be going down
We wouldn't even be arguing
Kill the arguments I see
Her point of view
Her point of view
Her point of view
Her point of view,
I see it
And we spend too much time complaining
And not enough time explaining
And now that I can see through your eyes when you cry
I can recognize your pain and point of view
Her point of view, I see it
Her point of view
Her point of view

[Verse 2]
Yo guess what?
Karen called I guess that was your hot date
And if you're innocent then why is your phone on vibrate
Rebecca said she saw your car in the parking lot at Friday's
I guess that would make you a smooth operator huh, Sade
So there's 10 guys with Benzes with the same custom rims
And the same fuckin' tints shaded to 45 percent
That just happened to be on the block near the park and the school that you went
But you left your Facebook open and told you dudes that you went
And I though this was something that we both cherished
And it's scary cuz I seen it going all the way to marriage
And that's just sad
How can I face friends without being embarrassed?
I know you cheating but I still can't find the courage
I'm repeating myself guess I'm the parrot
2 years and I'm still putting up wit your shit
Time for me to be the bird on some up and go shit

[Hook]
If I would have known then everything I know now
We'd be making up, shit be going down
We wouldn't even be arguing
Kill the arguments I see
Her point of view
Her point of view
Her point of view
Her point of view
I see it
And we spend too much time complaining
And not enough time explaining
And now that I can see through your eyes when you cry
I can recognize your pain and point of view
Her point of view, I see it
Her point of view
Her point of view

She said
If only I can be like you (if only I can be like you)
Only (I said) I can be like you (but you can)
Na na na na (you can), na na na na
She said (she said)
If only I can live my life like you
If only I can do the things you do
Come on girl (na na na na)
Give it a try (na na na na)
It'll be her POV
