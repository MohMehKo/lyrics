Your love is a maze
And I lost my way
Now I can't find my way out, way out

Yeah, it's barely lunch time
I'm sending you another text
No response, wondering if you got my other text
You won't pick up the line
The silence messing with my mind
I'm laughing like it's fine but thinking
Where the fuck your mother at
At least she'll listen when I'm bitchin', heartbroken
And she'll apply the patch like I just quit smoking
It's funny how emotions make it hard to accept
When you're the 24th letter, a non factor just an X
It's weighing heavy on my chest
Like an over racked bench press
Is this really happening?
No Freddie Wong, no VFX
How you unfollow me, ignore my friend request
My homey said it's over but fuck him I ain't finished yet
So I called you back I'm blowing up your line
(I got Adele on repeat so fuck you I'll be fine
I'm just playing girl pick up the phone
Where you at)
Erase my call log time to pretend I'm OK

Lying to myself I'm OK but ain't no way
I can make this feeling go away
Ain't love a bitch
Ain't love a bitch
Ain't love a bitch
Lying to my friends I'm OK but it won't go away
It only gets worst by the day
Ain't love a bitch
Ain't love a bitch
Ain't love a bitch

Uh, relationships go sour like lemons but we just can't admit it
Dogs lying to get the kitty, cats claim to stay committed
Calling, he lying, did it all to get inside
But he was like a hoarder holding all his shit inside
Baby what's a main course without a garnish and a side
We're just a pack of stupid lions and we call it foolish pride
2 years 1 daughter later, embracing all her haters
Finally found the will to get away cause you was not as Jada
And now you play the same songs your mama used to play
Trapped in the house and ain't been out in almost seven days
Now all your girlfriends trying to drag you to the club
Your glass is filled to kill the pain and to disguise the fact that you're in love
And then your phone rings out of the blue
He on his Barney shit
I love you baby can I come through
Your heart takes over
Here comes that lame ass excuse but your friends they know the truth
Who you really lying to

Lying to myself I'm OK but ain't no way
I can make this feeling go away
Ain't love a bitch
Ain't love a bitch
Ain't love a bitch
Lying to my friends I'm OK but it won't go away
It only gets worst by the day
Ain't love a bitch
Ain't love a bitch
Ain't love a bitch

Your love is a maze
And I lost my way
Now I can't find my way out, way out
Your love is a maze
And I lost my way
Now I can't find my way out, way out

Lying to myself I'm OK but ain't no way
I can make this feeling go away
Ain't love a bitch
Ain't love a bitch
Ain't love a bitch
Lying to my friends I'm OK but it won't go away
It only gets worst by the day
Ain't love a bitch
Ain't love a bitch
Ain't love a bitch
