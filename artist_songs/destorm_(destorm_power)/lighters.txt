[Hook: Megan Nicole]
This one's for you and me
Living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

[Verse 1: DeStorm]
I come from a place where death is usually the fate
And 75 percent of us would never graduate
Shout outs to mom, I never cried she was the dad in the place
The blood fathers didn't bother what a damn disgrace
I'm facing all my peers calling me a bastard kid
I learn to use my fists so I can try to smash the hate
Back then we bought our food with stamps somebody better pass the plate
A little hope, a lot of jokes from my classmates
I said instead of dropping tears I'm taking off like a rocketeer
Mama's getting old but she can't afford the rocking chair
Maybe I can get a higher stock this year
So I can buy my baby girl a rock this year
I lost another job but I gotta keep it reeling
Back to jail, seen the streets, the robbing, the stealing
But I made it out the hood I spent my left through this pen
And if I had to do it all again, I would

[Hook: Megan Nicole]

[Verse 2: DeStorm]
Don't let them lighters drop but you can give me writers bloc
I told you all before I'm reaching for the higher stock
And I wouldn't be surprised if they compared me to Pac
Cause I can make the choir rock before your ass can tie a knot
I am hot and don't you tell me otherwise
Save it for them other guys
Now that I discovered I
I can get the crowd pumping they be jumping out of their seats
So throw your lighters in the air for me

[Bridge: Megan Nicole]
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down
Forced to fight
Cause tonight we're all right
Hold up the light let it shine
A sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
