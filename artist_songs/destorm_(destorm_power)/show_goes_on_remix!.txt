[Intro:]
Kane is in the building
DeStorm is in the building

[Hook: from "Show Goes On" with DeStorm talking over]
I love this joint, man
Had to do it
How y'all feeling tonight?
Let's go!
Want y'all to rock to this
Entertainment at it's finest

[Verse 1: DeStorm]
I know y'all came for the flame
Strike the match and light it now
To get more fame, they rape my brain
Collect my thoughts and write it down
Recite it now
Don't fight it now
Now the hood's enlighted, wow
This my journey to the top
And everyone's invited now
Just focus on that wish you holding
Rip it like a pistol toting
Draw that anchor stay afloating
You don't want to waste your stroking
Understand when you reach land
To make sure that you tie that rope-ing
You don't wanna miss your boat and hope
They stay on the top like twist to open
Everybody wanna be a star
Trying to be the sun, dammit
Cause the sun's the most visible star from this planet
Can they stop my shine?
Of course not
My shit is potent four shots
If y'all going HAM then I must be going pork chop

[Hook: with DeStorm talking]
Shout outs to everybody
And anybody
Who may be somebody
And knew me when I was nobody
Hold up
Yeah
Tiger blood, baby
Can I get my Charlie Sheen on?
DeStorm
Hashtag
I'm winning

Watch Me

[Verse 2: Alyssa Marie]
The show is just beginning so
This one goes to the ones who said I'd slip and fall
But I guess it goes to show
When it's said and done
You're the one that picture roll
Knock the jury
But you're waiting for that verdict
When the picture isn't much
But still you paint it like it's perfect
And I'm told the curtain closes
When you wait to see your perfect moment
But those who search the globe and work to grow
Deserve to own it
With the show that I know when it's over
The people that see to the end
Will rise to defeat
When I'm leaving the stage
With a standing ovation
And leave with a sense at least I can
If she did
And she overcame that weakness
Through the defeat
Both feet on the cement
And I know when I aim for the steepest peak
It's a bigger risk, take it
When I scared to turn the pages
Say you're the writer in the book
With the pen in your hand
To determine what your faith is

[Hook x2: DeStorm]
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun go
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on
