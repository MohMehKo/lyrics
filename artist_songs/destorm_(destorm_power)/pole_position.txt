[Intro:]
There she go
She said she came to make it rain
You know
If you'll ever quit the game
Cause I think I love you
But she told me that she'll never stop
And she told me that she'll never stop
She said the monies coming too fast
Shout out to the hardiest working girl I know

[Verse 1:]
My studio and secret Sundays always raining dollars
Invite you to the VIP where niggas fuck those bottles
You know if you take that money from these niggas they goin' try to fuck
He got you spinning all you hate on men and how your tired of us
But your nine to five don't make enough
And you say you only used to the big stuff
Because the last one sports and gave you stuff that you could never afford
And you say I'm goin' get my bread
Yeah, and the only way you know how
As long as you independent they can tell you how to spin it
Tell them niggas they can go now
And then your song come on and your on the stage
And your thong comes out so you goin' get paid
So you tuck and roll and then you struck a pose
The way it disappear that's the way you fuck the pole

[Hook:]
I told her third place is good
Second place is better
But you're in pole position and it just don't get no better
Cause you're the hardest working girl I know
Hardest working girl I know
You're in pole position
You're the hardest working girl
And then you go in those heels, showing those skills
Throwing it back, I be throwing these bills
Shout out to you
Shout out to the hardest working girl I know

[Verse 2:]
You see niggas flirting
That you hatin' work but you goin' pay your bills
Stalkers got you cautious
But it's all good once you pop a pill
No MB but your keeping it real
And those other bitches fucking in the bathroom stall
But people call you no whore
But I'm sure you know them haters will

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Your the hardest working girl I know
Hardest working girl I know
Your in pole position your the hardest working girl
And you'll be going those hill showing them skills
Girl you got you niggas spunked throwing these bills
Maybe when your done we can go pop a pill
Cause I think I love you
Yeah I think I love you
Turn off the lights in here lady
Every night I got to see you
Turn off the lights in here
You what I need I'll pay to see everything
And tell me girl will you ever quit this game
I'm gonna need more than your stripper name
Because I think I love you, X4
