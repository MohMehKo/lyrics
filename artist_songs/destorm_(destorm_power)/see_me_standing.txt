[DeStorm]
Back and forth
Heart attack
You curse me out
And take it back
Your dirty mouth
It’s what I love
And hate most about you

[Alexandra Govere]
You want your cake
And eat it too
Ain't I enough
To please you
You’re hard to get
It’s what I love
And regret most about you

[Chorus – DeStorm & Alexandra Govere]
Where you going at
In a hurry
Is there something
That you wanna tell me
When you coming back
Don’t ignore me now

I need you to turn back around right now [X3]
And see me standing
I need you to turn back around right now [X2]
When you go
I’m alone in a crowd
Can you see me standing

[DeStorm]
Yeah, I messed around
I slept around
I hit the clubs
I fucked it up
But I ain't ready to suck it up
I guess that’s what a player gets
You know I love to watch you leave
But only if you’re coming back
Stop, you’re messing up the plans
We had this evening
And if I hit again
You gone forget why you were leaving
Ha, I’m an asshole
But you like it
If I been ditched
You’d be up on my dick

[Chorus – DeStorm & Alexandra Govere]
Where you going at
In a hurry
Is there something
That you wanna tell me
When you coming back
Don’t ignore me now

I need you to turn back around right now [X3]
And see me standing
I need you to turn back around right now [X2]
When you go
I’m alone in a crowd
Can you see me standing

[Bridge – Alexandra Govere]
I never really thought about changing you
But if you’re really sorry for the things you do
Then maybe we could try again
Maybe we could try again

[Chorus – DeStorm & Alexandra Govere]
I need you to turn back around right now [X3]
And see me standing
I need you to turn back around right now [X2]
When you go
I’m alone in a crowd
Can you see me standing

[Outro – DeStorm]
Yo, hey
For real thou
I just be talking shit
Come on
You know how I get
