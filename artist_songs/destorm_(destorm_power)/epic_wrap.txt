[Verse 1: DeStorm]
I heard you got beef, you better squash that
Cause this is our time, you better watch that
No one let us out the cage, we just hopped that
Leaped that, knocked that shit 'til it drop back
Now we're in the lead y'all ain't gon' catch up
We was built for speed, how you gon' catch us?
You gon' have to bleed if you want to match us
We're the winning ticket, must be why you're trying to scratch us

[Pre-Hook:]
When we stood up, everybody sat down
And the industry, we put 'em on their back now
Got 'em shook from the views that we rack now
It's the Epic wRap now, we will never back down

[Hook:]
Everybody better move the fuck aside
Ain't no faking up in here, we're just baking/bacon up in here
We give you so much that you won't believe your eyes
Ain't no faking up in here, we're just baking up in here

[Verse 2: Harley]
Where are them sluts at? Where are them sluts?
Epic Meal Time all about the cold cuts
Mustard and mayo and ketchup and sauce
Million views cause I'm such a bawce
See me front page every single day
Not a big deal, I'm just trying to get laid
And you know that I got this obsession of pork
Eating everything without a fork
Sucking on the nipple of the teet of the Jack
Leave some for the wrap and add a Big Mac
No I can't cook, this is just a good look
Diva on the beat, De's on the hook

[Outro: Harley]
While you where sitting on your couch
Hatin' on us
We're making music and food in the kitchen
Stop hatin' on that
