[Intro:]
Uh, yeah
And then my Momma said (yo)
And all my fans said
He did it again (na na na)
And then my Momma said

[Hook:]
Every time I look at you, I'm prouder
I know ain't nobody goin' be like you
Every time I look at you, I'm prouder
I know ain't nobody goin' be like you
I stay up on my grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind
I stay up on my grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind

[Verse 1:]
It's time to claim the throne
They tell me don't go there
The hottest motherfucker don shot up out of nowhere
And he's mighty arrogant
Does he have experience?
Check your mirror I'll bet your head bobbing when you be hearing this
The year was 1988, Mom and Dad divorced but wait
What we goin' do about the kids? She said we have eight
He said, "I don't give a fuck about 'em
Now get the fuck up out of here"
It took about a year, but we were out of there
A one way ticket to the ghetto
She taught us all a lesson: count your blessings and struggle before you settle
Now success is pulling in, Mama
Take your seat in Heaven
Reminisce on the Good Times damn, Florida Evans

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
My grind's been all crazy since I lost my first lady
Said farewell to welfare when I had my first baby
Can't spit 16 about drugs, I never dealt 'em
Every cop on the block had clubs, make sure you felt 'em
We blackjacks of seeing 21, was very seldom
I got charged, put behind bars, would booze cars and sell them
And when I'm back on the streets again, I'mma bring the heat again
I don't even want to see the pent, music is my medicine
No medicine, a hard knock life, until you let us in
No cartoons, no longer the underdog so I better win
Consider me a veteran, you can hear it in my bars
Fuck a ball of gas, I'm a star

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I'd like to dedicate this verse to all my fans around the world
That's raised one fist, unite your hands around the world
If success is on your mind and you know you're on your grind
Then you halfway there
Don't you quit before your time comes
I know what it's like to have nothing
And turn it into something
When life is so hard, you can't take it no more
That's when you gotta really want it
So just hang in there

[Hook]
