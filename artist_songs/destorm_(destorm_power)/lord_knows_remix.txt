Yeah
I'm just trying to kill every platform possible
Everywhere you look you gonna say he's a beast
Ha ha, I'm on the big screen, on the little screen
Nigga' you gonna see me in your dreams
DeMix (cause ain't no dream too big for me to dream)

Yo, these chicks don't wanna network, they just want my net worth
I ain't stopping til' I have my own Bentley Fonsworth
But I'm a make him white though, nah that ain't a typo
Soon as the i8 drops prepare for the light show
Styling on some island while you talking about you might go
Pockets on lean, smooth criminal Michael
How dare you muthafukas try to tell me I ain't sick yet
In trouble for a sex tape and I ain't get my dick wet
I learned to live with regrets, watch who you partner with
They don't even know me all these activist is popping shit
Say I'm falling but the only thing I drop is hits
Don't make me have to pop a bitch, (no joke) Popovich
Fucking vegetarians, they don't really want the beef
Pescatarians rarely do they wanna meet
Keep bringing the heat like I'm rocking gold and red
Won't stop til' I'm old and dead
You can do better go ahead and try
And while you yappin' I'm probably somewhere on the redeye
80% Baltimore 20% BedStuy
Calling niggas out would take more than 48 bars
So I leave that to the Cassidy's and Kendrick Lamar's
I broke bread with the stars made my peace with the gods
Nigga fuck the hand that's dealt it's what you do with the cards
I'm a walking brand all up in your ears like a walkman
Everybody listen when DeStorm gets to talking man
