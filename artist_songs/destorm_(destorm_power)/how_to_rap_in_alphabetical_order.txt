I do it for the block, I do it for the streets
And I'm a get the pot 'cause I'm feeling lucky
You think you got me hot 'cause you said fuck me
Well I'm afraid not, fuck you too
While I run this Youtube
Shhh...
I do it for the block, I do it for the streets
And I'm a get the pot 'cause I'm feeling lucky
You think you got me hot 'cause you said fuck me
Well I'm afraid not, fuck you too
While I run this Youtube
Shhh...

A brother can't deny every freaking gift handed
I'm just killing lines man, now others panic
Questions R starting to unfold visually why
X Youtuber zippin' all by
Creative dialogue entice fans go harder
Jump keep leaping making new orders
Please quit ripping, stop tripping
Underground veteran, who X yup!
Zoom around, bringing crews down
Each flight gaining height, I just kane lounge
Mission never over, Pawn Queens rookies
Still tearing up videos while x'ing y'all zeros
After beasting, constantly dominating
Every fucking gangsta hating...
Is jealousy killing live music nowadays
O probably quietly Runaway

(Let me get 'em again)

After all angry antics, B-more's bully Brooklyn bandit
Crushing competition, cocky confident candid
Debonair diesel, De's doing damn do
Eliminate each enemy for fans fool
Fourty foot Gorilla Gigantor Godzilla
Homes hall hopper, hard is ice, engine killer
