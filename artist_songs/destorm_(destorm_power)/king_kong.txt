I found my place
And it's me on top of the world
I am King Kong, drop the gate
I hear the chariot coming today
I am King Kong
I'm King Kong
I'm King Kong
I'm King Kong

I'm King Kong, beat my fisting chest
I don't feel the pressure, show the world the best
I endure the pain, let the gorillas out
Ignore the chains, now all my niggas out
Thou hath forsaken me
Finally back making heat, cooking like a bakery
Now there ain't no breaking me down
Where my ancestors, wish that they can see me now
I'm the best no question, ain't no testing me

I found my place
And it's me on top of the world
I'm King Kong, drop the gate
I hear the chariots coming today
I am King Kong (King Kong)
King Kong (King Kong)
I'm King Kong (King Kong)
I'm King Kong
(Now who the best?) King Kong
(Beat your chest) King Kong
(You the best) King Kong
(Beat your chest) I am King Kong

And how that baby from the 80's got this generation crazy
Cause G.O.O.D Music Roc boy, you'd think I was with Shady
Shout out to my niggas getting Young Money
Still I'm trying to get that old money
Oops, I mean that royal money, haters these days are so funny
Ha ha ha, false as shit, taking shit, blah, blah, blah
You can't beat me, why you gotta try?
I'm a fame monster, Lady Ga Ga
And I ain't gonna lie, if I ain't get mine
I wouldn't be fly
I'd be back in the project hallways all day
Nah, I'm just lying, I would grind 'til I get mine

I found my place
And it's me on top of the world
I'm King Kong, drop the gate
I hear the chariots coming today
I am King Kong (King Kong)
King Kong (King Kong)
I'm King Kong (King Kong)
I'm King Kong
(Now who the best?) King Kong
(Beat your chest) King Kong
(You the best) King Kong
(Beat your chest) I am King Kong

I see the horizon, where queens are dipped in gold
And diamond rings are so fat
All my kings from every hood finally living good
We've come too far to go back
Yeah, so drink up, drink up, we ain't promised tomorrow
We're only promised this bottle of the finest Moscato
And I'ma live by that motto, I may just fly to Cabo
Ding dong, ring the bell of a fabulous model
I'm King Kong
I'm King Kong
I'm King Kong
I'm King Kong
I'm King Kong!

I found my place
And it's me on top of the world
I'm King Kong, drop the gate
I hear the chariots coming today
I am King Kong (King Kong)
King Kong (King Kong)
I'm King Kong (King Kong)
I'm King Kong
(Now who the best?) King Kong
(Beat your chest) King Kong
(You the best) King Kong
(Beat your chest) I am King Kong

We found our place
Now we're on top of the world
We are King Kong, drop the gates
I hear the chariots coming today
We are King Kong
We're King Kong
We're King Kong
We're King Kong

(King Kong)
