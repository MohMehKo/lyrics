[Intro:]
Yeah, so um
Everybody trying to figure out
The best way to get to that next level
Life so bad they want to feel good
Yo

[Verse 1:]
Every day a new fan comes to me and tells me I'm their idol
Making shorty's words of vital soon I'll see prophets like the Bible
I never mind my rivals, they don't decide what I do
And to show you things you never seen since seventeen like a haiku
Blessings steady rolling in
Fake ass niggas on the troll again
But I'd rather be hated than talked about
So I'm screaming out, here we go again
And I can't blame them they just want to be us
I know how you feel, I was on the same bus
It's hard to see yourself so you got to blame us
Only you control how you get your game up

[Hook:]
Music got us so high, so high, so high
We can't walk away from it
This shit got us feeling all right (all right)
Don't give a fuck, we coming up
Getting high of it, why stop it?
This shit got us feeling all right

[Verse 2:]
At eighteen putting these words together that rhyme then impress my peers
Will soon compress my tears, so why invest in years?
Knowing nothing good comes over night
In the hood out front like an over bite
Only hanging with my niggas that I know will fight
Now I can see the future and it sure looks bright
On the Greyhound bus taking trips to Harlem but a new city just won't fix the problem
Got to get paid, got to get away, three thousand six hundred fifty days of stardom
That's ten more years of grinding out but the only thing that comes with time is doubt
This game is like quicksand, once you try to stand you can struggle but it ain't no climbing out
Cause everybody want to be the one that made it
Quit from your Mom you the one that paid it
But you still ain't getting no shine now you busy crying to your niggas that you're underrated
And you're tired of waiting running out of patience
And your contemplating and you're not a patient
You have stepped in the game and tried to make a name
But your passion for this shit has gone away

[Hook]

[Bridge: x2]
All right
All right
High off it, why stop it?
This shit got us feeling all right

[Verse 3:]
Yeah and I'm no longer sinning now
Showing the world I'm winning now
This my Wheel of Fortune
And it's my turn to spin it now
And I'm feeling all right
And I'm feeling all right
And I'm feeling all right
And I'm feeling all right

[Hook]

[Bridge x2]
