[Intro:]
I can't explain it
She cut me off
Like she's trying to steal my lane and

[Verse 1:]
They say every girl wants what she can't have
It's in her nature
We gas you up, we pass you bucks
We crash, we unghhh then trade ya
In, for a better model
Eventually regret will follow
Just because the wine is new
Don't make that shit a better bottle
It's funny how along with fame
Comes a lot of doubt and greed
Now I'm breaking hearts of girls
I used to think were out my league
I never thought that she
Would leave me hanging like a balcony
But you did, yes you did
Now look what we turned out to be

[Bridge:]
She left me like I'm standing on the opposite of right
I guess we both knew I was not gon' get it right
You'd think we lived in Vegas from the way that we would fight
And you'd play Billy Jean, I'd tell you "speak into the mic"

[Hook:]
But you cut me off
You cut me off
You cut me off
I don't need your love (need your love)
You treat me like a stranger
How'd you
Stoop so low
Stoop so low
You ain't have to do it
You're just a girl
That I used to know (I used to know)
And now you're just
Somebody that I used to know

[Verse 2:]
These girls will cut you off
Like a rapper who lost his label deal
Or your favorite show is on
And you forgot to pay the cable bill
She'll be moving on
And you'll be thinking maybe she'll
Return...
Better learn...
Call up Usher...
Let it burn
All my friends are settling down
Steady making families
While I got booty-itis
Still I'm coping with this damn disease
You're falling out of love with me?
Who the hell is he?
Oh you forgot to mention?
I was busy paying the bills
He was busy paying attention

[Bridge]
