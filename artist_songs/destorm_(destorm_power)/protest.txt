[Intro:]
Yeah yeah all my soldiers
I want y'all to wake up
Say this with me, say

[Hook x4:]
We ain't got live like this, protest
We ain't got take this shit
Protest
Why we got to be the ones to put up with the madness
Don't you
Think we had enough, protest

[Verse 1:]
Yo, I ain't tryin' live like this
I ain't no flight risk
You disrespecting God cause I was made in this life this
This ain't about the blackness
This ain't about the whiteness
It's about
The Government, want us to treat them like your highness
But man I ain't buying it
Man I ain't trying it
Threw papers in my face and try to get me to sign 'em
I'm on the paper chase trying to rise from the bottom
End before midnight before the po-pos say they got 'em
They ain't goin' have me locked up in no jail cell
Well hell nah tryin' to tell me get used to the bars
Used to the laws and used to the bottom
Tell me about basic [?]
Sorry Mr. Warden, general sergeant
We all know it's never been about Bin Laden
You want me to fight on another man's soil
Well you can find another way to get your war cause

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2:]
Scribble on our picket signs and take 'em to New York
We occupy Wall Street and then commence to walk
But standing here we some fucking cardboard
Ain't goin' change my scars [?] or put food on the dinner table
We got to think smarter
We got to hustle harder
They take me out from my beliefs I better be a [?]
And you can call me [?]
30 bars later, our nations not starving
Why they keep us occupied with virtual worlds and entertainment
They just take our brains and continue to train 'em
So when you get this message share it with the modern day
So in the future people are bandin' together stayin' together sayin'

[Hook x2]

[Outro:]
Put the picket signs down
We got to hustle harder than that
Put your thinking caps on
Yeah you know you're smarter than that
Protest
