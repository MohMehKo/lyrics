I hear you complaning, about the way people have made it
But I have never seen you do anything, that's not the way you get it
It's not about the words, it's about the actions not the statements
Because many claim to be the greatest, but facts speak louder than verses

So calm down, and just reherse man, don't let down, even if they hate it
Because nobody was born perfect, and to master the craft you must be way ahead of it
You don't need to be smart to drop the best bars, you need to be real and stay Hip-Hop
Cause no one can be better than you, when you love it, and no one can beat you
Haters equals nothing

I rap since I was thirteen, and I am waiting to be eighteen
So I can start crushing the mics from the hip-hop scene, in Venezuela and internationally
But professionally, and also in spanish, Si?
I'll give the world my vision through my lyrics, and bless the industry with my personality

Originality, no one is giving it
I'm so original, my blood type is limited
DeStorm Watch Me, Two Oh Thirteen
I'm not waiting to be a winner, but I know that I got it

R.I.P Trayvon Martin
We need love in this World, so that this doesnt happen
Screw a beat, Even if you don't win in life
Do what you think it's correct and make your life worth it
