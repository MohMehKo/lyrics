[Intro:]
Yeah
A dedication
To the love of my life
Yo, check it

[Hook:]
Why is everybody hatin'
All up in our faces
Talkin' that talk about we ain't gonna make it
Don't stress it
We so above em now
Our feet don't touch the ground
We so high above
Just gotta trust our love

[Verse 1:]
When we met so many said that we would never be
Got dirty looks from the friends and the family
But we just shook em off
Hoped things would change them all
They never changed, we rearranged us and raised the bar
I had that nine to five
Dropping fries at Burger King
While you working, school, searching, steady, doing the college thing
Back then I was a bit afraid
To mention you in public
Now people ask me how we're doing
I simply say I love it

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Now I'm a little older
And I'm a bit wiser
I learned some new tricks
And got a couple new surprises
This time, ain't nobody catching us off guard
We held down B-More
Now we in Brooklyn and we go hard
I spent so many nights
Making sure I did you right
Fast forward to today
And now we're taking flight
I tell you haters step off
Get out of my sight
You can't split up me and music
The love of my life

[Hook:]
Now we all know I love my music
But I had to do a remix for the ladies, y'all
Check it out
Come on!

[Verse 3:]
I asked my homies
Should we be together?
They said no
I asked your mama
Could she see us together?
She said no
And your best friend
I asked her for her blessing
She said no
Can I just call you
Take you out?
And your papa said no
But we gon' be alright
Beause our love is stronger
Than all those chains
That they used to bring my
Ancestors to this land
I promise you, I'll remain your man
So funk what the haters say
Eventually, they fade away
When they gone
We'll still be going strong

[Hook:]
Yeah
We all got haters out there
And if you don't
Then you doing something wrong
Don't stress it
Cause we so above that
Break it down!

[Outro:]
Said I'm so above you now
That my feet don't touch the ground
Mike Kalombo on the track
Klassic
DeStorm
The renaissance man
I want y'all to look down at your haters
And say, "I'm so above you now
My feet don't even touch the ground"
