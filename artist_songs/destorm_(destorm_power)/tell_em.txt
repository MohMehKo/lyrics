[Verse 1:]
Yo, if life is what you make it hot damn I found a recipe
All of the ingredients to give the world the best of me
Came in for the zeros plus my city needed a hero
So I'm doing it for the bay all day nigga, Chesapeake
I'm so hot Harm City gets an early summer
Never front, I got your back like a jersey number
I put in work and then retire like I'm Worthy's number
Hall of famers, all us famous, call us the early comers
Never plan to see the day they say "did he fail?"
Cause everyday somebody gets behind my bars like city-jail
Promise to never drop the ball or let you fall like training wheels
We tradin' in umbrellas for wallets, "it's raining bills."
Got an army ready to respond when I say, "strike"
To convert the nonbelievers I had to draw my life
This one's for Brinna and Bliss, this one's for Asia and Diamond
The entire Power Family gettin' paid off rhymin'
I've been hustlin' now look at me
Come tomorrow where will I be?
Cause I got that billion-dollar grind
And money on my mind
Y'all bitches better know it's my time

[Hook:]
(Tell 'em)
Yeah, I turn nothin' into 'erething (tell 'em)
I turn nothin' into 'erething (tell 'em)
I turn nothin' into 'erething
Real nigga came from nothin' now I'm 'erething

[Verse 2:]
A simple change can make a difference, but it's up to you to learn
Like when Veronica told me never choose the Jergan's over Lubriderm
I feel for thirsty niggas cause it's really not a good look
I feel for battle rappers who can never write a good hook
I feel for ghetto bitches for never picking up a good book
Or learn to set the table you ain't gotta be a good cook
And I'm sorry my last song wasn't 'bout guns
Or heatin' the pot up in the kitchen to acquire legal funds
Nigga God is my protection and I'm still raw
Cause I gotta couple goons with a lot less to live for
Busy winning I ain't gotta gloat
Busy with my riches pullin bitches, I ain't got a rope
Busy takin' trips and making chips, yeah, Idaho
Hot for period, DeStorm gotta flow
Bitch niggas gossipin' on how he just exploded
Got more videos on private then these newbies uploaded
I've been hustlin' now look at me
Come tomorrow where will I be?
Cause I got that billion-dollar grind
And money on my mind
Ya'll bitches better know it's my time

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
And it's funny how the ones who said
They bled for you and stuck with you
Are the same names comin' up with you
Really they didn' fuck with you
Now the games changes them same lames saying ''what's up with you?"
I'm the fucking bull and I wouldn't let a buck hit you
Said I wouldn't do it so I really had to do it
Ain't no budget here, 50k, ran through it
Change my name to Darth cause I'm a fucking innovator
Show these fucking haters De done went and got his weight up
I've been hustlin' now look at me
Come tomorrow where will I be?
Cause I got that billion-dollar grind
And money on my mind
Y'all bitches better know it's my time

[Hook]
