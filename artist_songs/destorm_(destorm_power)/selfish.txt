[Verse 1:]
Yo, I'm spending money on these girls that I hardly know
I guess my weakness is these freaks up in the party, yo
My kryptonite but still I'm like just let the bottles flow
Crack a smile and show some ass and you can probably go
Anyway you wanna go, long as you keep running your game
I'll keep fronting like the money don't matter
Girl we only stopping for some cardio (ah huh, ah huh)
Now turn up the audio
Just getting started, though
Who'd ever thought it'd go this far
What you want? Louis bags? This car?
She playing me like a guitar but I don't really care
As long as the result is her legs up in the air
I swear she plays her role well, Oscar winner
At the hotel giving mo' tail, lobster dinner
First world problems only fine women can solve
I'm Shallow Hal hoping one day to evolve but

[Hook:]
I know I can't have 'em all
But I feel like I need 'em all
And I know I can't help it
No I just can't help myself
And I know I can't have 'em all
But I feel like I need 'em all
And it makes me selfish
But I just can't help myself

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, I think I got that Lenny Kravitz
My Halle's at home while these bitches living lavish
It's true, and they don't look half as good as she do
But I don't care as long as they don't tell what we do
And it's hard to be true when these hoes want the same thing
Claim the opposite but then they run the same game
Fuck playing the blame game, I'm just trying to maintain
Once the numbers exchange it's funny how the names change
A brand new whore up in the phone
Replace her name with where I met her then I store it in the phone
Cause I don't really plan on knowing her for too long
I get bored, I can afford to explore it then I'm gone
And I swear I even take 'em home
Park the ride and say c'mon
Long as I can make 'em moan, I'mma play the chaperone
And it's a habit that I can't kick
I'll admit I am sick
Addicted to these damn chicks

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
You don't complain
I don't complain
I can't contain
All of these things
And it makes me selfish
But I just can't help myself
You don't complain
She don't complain
I can't contain
All of this game
And it makes me selfish
But I just can't help myself
