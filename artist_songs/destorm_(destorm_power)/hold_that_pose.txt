[Intro:]
Yeah to my small town girls
Hug this pole and hold that pose
Yeah to my big town girls
You better hug this pole and hold that pose
You a model girl you better hug this pole and hold that pose
Yo, check it

[Verse 1:]
She said she came from a small town
Where the leaves on the trees still fall down
Where the kids on the street still playing ball now
And they still use a quarter just to make a call, damn
Working at a diner and her boyfriend's a running back
Wanna leave it all but she keep running back
Graduated school at 17
Fuck college Mommy got another dream
Entire town got your [?] sayin' you so pretty
Convince your Mom you can make it in the big city
Even your man and your pops said you probably could
Now you on the Greyhound on the way to Hollywood
Call your family every day, you can function better
Said you met a couple girls and you bunk together
A few months pass times a bit hard
Until money sees your face then he slips you his card and says

[Hook:]
What your name is
Tell me what your name is
Ain't no shame here we ain't playing games here
I make you famous I could make you famous
That's what you came to city for ain't it
Keep your chin up shoulders back titties out
Tuck your stomach in stand tall booty out
Now pose bitch
Hug this pole hold that pose
Now pose bitch
Hug this pole hold that pose
Now pose bitch
Hug this pole hold that pose
Keep your chin up shoulders back titties out
Tuck your stomach in stand tall booty out
Now pose bitch
Hug this pole hold that pose

[Bridge:]
Pose bitch
Hug this pole hold that pose
Pose bitch
Hug this pole hold that pose

[Verse 2:]
Then shorty said you clown for that
I ain't down for that
Black card hit the table hear the sound of that
She said you can't buy me nigga
Then he said bitch how you figure
I thought you came to see your name in lights, huh
One more week and you'll be changing flights, hun
On your way back if you want to stay back
Better pop that booty hop your ass in my Maybach
She said hell no I won't sell though
I'm sticking to my plan like velcro
So she hopped out the car walked into a bar
In her head still believing she's a star
Approached by another nigga
Tell me what you drink
Tell me what your thinkin'
Tell me what you think
She looked into his eyes she's attracted to his ink
Finally an honest guy until he turned and said

[Hook x2]

[Outro:]
Now pose bitch
Hug this pole hold that pose
Now pose bitch
Hug this pole hold that pose
