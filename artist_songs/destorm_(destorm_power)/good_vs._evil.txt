[Verse 1: "Good DeStorm"]
Uhh, man
Hello self
We Haven't spoken in a while
You be provoking this anger
When I simply wana smile
I know you believe that the whole world's against us
And there's no justice
But maybe it's just us

[Verse 2: "Bad DeStorm"]
Ain't nothing good 'bout this world
They shoot bullets we duck 'em
Take everything they have
If they get angry then fuck 'em
We got the gun
We got the ride
Let's go and get this paper now
The car is double parked outside
Time to pull the caper now

[Verse 3: "Good DeStorm"]
We got pinned for the same crime
And that was kinda
Spent the whole summer in jail man
And I ain't goin' back
Times have changed self
There's more opportunities
And what about these kids
Growin' up in our communities

[Verse 4: "Bad DeStorm]
Fuck the kids
They ain't ours
They're hopeless anyway
Let's' get this paper dawg
Let's live for today
A couple bottles or Ciroc
And a little bit of weed
Two fine shawties
And some wheels is all we need

[Chorus "Good DeStorm"]
Said, I don't know
What has gotten into me
Into me
This could be the end of me
End of me
["Bad DeStorm":]
Toughen up
["Good DeStorm":]
I've become my own enemy
Enemy, Ememy
And I have so much
Negitive energy
Energy
From this demon trapped inside of me
Inside of me
["Bad DeStorm":]
I'm not a demon!
["Good DeStorm":]
Makes me my own enemy
Enemy, enemy, enemy
Yeah

[Verse 5: "Bad DeStorm"]
Stop Bitching out!
We realy need to go
I'm tired of being on welfare
And shoppin' at the dollar store
The baby needs diapers
Our girl needs shoes
With 16 bullets man we just can't lose

[Verse 6: "Good Destorm"]
16?
Cops have millions
I don't wana be behind the glass
Talkin to our children
Explaining to em'
How we thought we was bad
Taking from other mothafuckers
Trying to be a good dad

[Verse 7: "Bad DeStorm"]
I SMELL PUSSY!
It ain't like
We ain't never been down this road before
And it was your idea in '04
To rob the corner store

[Verse 8: "Good DeStorm"]
Yeah maybe
But that was seven years ago

[Verse 9: "Bad DeStorm"]
So now you have a revelation
And our whole life changed
We used to be a team
I'm the muscles
And you would be the brain

[Verse 10: "Good DeStorm"]
Since I'm the brains of the operation
I'm shutting it down

[Verse 11: "Bad DeStorm"]
Whatever!
I guess I'll find another way
To put it down

[Chorus: "Good DeStorm"]
Said, I don't know
What has gotten into me
Into me
This could be the end of me
End of me
["Bad DeStorm":]
Let's get this money
["Good DeStorm":]
I've become my own enemy
Enemy, enemy
And I have so much
Negative enemy
Energy
From this demon trapped inside of me
Inside of me
["Bad DeStorm":]
I'm not a demon!
["Good DeStorm":]
Makes me my own enemy
Enemy, enemy, enemy
Yeah
