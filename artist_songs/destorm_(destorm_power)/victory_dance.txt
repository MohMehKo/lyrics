[Intro x4:]
Gone girl, shake it shake it like that

[Verse 1 - Destorm:]
Yo, ya, yo, I went hard for the whole summer
I had to give em somethin’ that the people like
You got bills on yo mind, I got mills up on mine
I’m assuming we don’t think alike
Lost a hundred racks on investments
Made a million back on investments
A valuable lesson (school these niggas)
Royalties in the jeans, I’m never second guessin’
Now I’m the fuckin’ greatest, I’m the greatest
Call me Cassius Clay, I’m the greatest
My throw, my phone, my ladies
In the club flipping birds to the haters (birds to the haters!)

[Hook:]
This a victory dance
Walk up out the club with your bitch in my hand
I just stick to the plan
Now they all be on my dick cuz the know I’m the man
Hell yeah, victory dance, do it right
Victory dance, don’t stop
Victory dance, all night
This my victory dance
Walk about the bank with money and bands
Gone girl, shake it shake it like that
Gone girl, shake it shake it like that
Dap dararap

[Verse 2 - Destorm:]
Hol’ up yo, somebody said the crown’s for the takin’ (Imma take it)
Couple million new fans since April
And that’s simple mathematics, now I’m in the attic
Y'all niggas in the basement
I already showed you the best, that ain’t cologne, that’s the smell of success
Booked the tour days just the Planet of Apes
In the club, I am Caesar, just beatin’ my chest
Captured your queen, I am beating at chess
Why did at me for you to get upset
Okay, you right, nigga, we left
She saw my followers and she was impressed

[Hook:]
This a victory dance
Walk up out the club with your bitch in my hand
I just stick to the plan
Now they all be on my dick cuz the know I’m the man
Hell yeah, victory dance, do it right
Victory dance, don’t stop
Victory dance, all night
This my victory dance
Walk about the bank with money and bands
Gone girl, shake it shake it like that
Gone girl, shake it shake it like that
Dap dararap

Do the victory dance

[Bridge x2:]
She said she got money on her mind
I told her to do it for the vine (do it for the vine)
And she just might do it (she just might do it)
And she just might do it
