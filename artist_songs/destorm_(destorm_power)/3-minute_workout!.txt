[Intro:]
Ladies get on your feet
It's time to work it out
It's time to work that body right now
Let's go
It's the warm up

[Bridge:]
You better work it out
You better work it out
You better work it out
Because I want to see your body right now
You better work it out
You better work it out
Because I want to see your body right now
Work, work, work, work
Because I want to see your body right now
Work, work, work, work
Girl you working it out

[Verse 1:]
It's 6 p.m. and she back in the gym again
She working out again yeah she working out again
Plus summer's coming and it's time to swap your winter friend
You getting in too many giving you the hint again
Bad time, you don't want to let him in
You feeling gross, he pinching on your extra skin
But then again, you know he right
Working out like white girls trying to get it tight
It's time to get slim again, maybe get some swimming in
Hot yoga class that's filled with some women and
A couple men, start to get your supplements
Hit the treadmill, run it out for a couple minutes
Turn the pace up, you shedding weight now
Pick them weights up, and get your waist down
You bought a brand new dress for the party tonight
So you know you gotta get your fucking body right

[Hook:]
I see you working on your arms
Working on your back
Love it when you sweating for it
Running on a track like that
It's like that
It's like that
It's like that
I see you working on your abs
Working on your thighs
Working on that ass
I ain't know you had it like that
It's like that
It's like that
It's like that

[Verse 2:]
You said you're goin' start your diet up in two days
And try some CrossFit, cause it's the new craze
Hah, now you can almost fit up in that Gucci
Just a little more off the top, toup√©es
I hear you got a trainer, and he working with you
And that's a no brainer, he doing circus with you
But you ain't pay him, did you? You on a budget
So when he flirting with you, you like fuck it
It's December and you got five months so if that's the price
It's like Simba, just a small sacrifice
You learning muscles, hamstrings and such
Deltoids, rhomboids, damn things touch
Now you eating salad, sipping on ViSalus
All heads turning, now baby that's talent
You just killed a challenge, I knew you wouldn't fail
Go on over there and hop your ass up on the scale
