[Intro:]
Yeah
There they go again
Talking the same shit

[Hook: x2]
Long as my niggas know
They goin' spread rumors
They goin' spread lies
They goin' do whatever
Just to get a rise
Long as my niggas know
Let 'em talk (x7)
Long as my niggas know

[Verse 1:]
Oh God, y'all need to see this, y'all really need to see this
Like that mama who's in trauma and simply couldn't keep the fetus
We've been put in for a reason, mine is not to be defeated
I will not be deleted, promise not to be conceded
Even when my energy's depleted take the bullet, bite it, eat it
Take these lyrics, write 'em, read 'em then recite 'em, then re-read 'em
Leave you with the best of me if it's not enough to rest in me
On my Colonel Sanders shit and here's the secret recipe
Which opens doors to all the envy and jealousy
But I never planned to be second like the letter B
Fake niggas stepped to me while real niggas testifying
Bitches burning, thirsty niggas who ain't afraid to touch the fire
And if I was arrogant you could say it's justified
Show me another rapper who can make a million press subscribe
My guess when pigs fly, hot since Big died
But you ain't gotta tell me, though

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2:]
Niggas lying on their riches, got no time for these watches
They ain't laying on these bitches, they just lying on their notches
Skip 'em like first class, now I'm in the cockpit
Combination to the game, course I'm goin' lock it
Modern day prophet, say it in every song
Nigga fuck your religion, suck it up and sing along
No need to be alarmed, nigga bring some weed along
Seen so many hands up lately I've been reading palms
And every single song, I'm a drop bombs
Got a watch in every color and I call 'em Lucky Charms
But let these haters tell it that I'm struggling
I see rappers clock in and clock out, I'm here to put a double in
Now my careers bubbling like pizzas in the oven
And I'm not a sheep so I'm talking back to the Government
Since I don't do the same things I'm not considered mainstream
I let 'em say whatever though

[Hook x2]

[Outro:]
I keep a bad bitch in my circle man
But let them tell it I'm Manti Te'o in this bitch
Let me tell y'all something
A pirate, never talks about his booty
Never forget that
