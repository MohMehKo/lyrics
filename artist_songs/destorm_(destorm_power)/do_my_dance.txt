[Verse 1]
I had $20 in my pocket
But I walk around like I'm filthy rich
And I blow it all on some new J's
I was damn broke but now we in this bitch
Cause we built for this, so we guilt for this
Say fuck tradition, make our own position
Now call me the boss, toss me the ball
We at the top now it's hard for me to fall
These my niggas, all my niggas
Step out of line, I'mma call my niggas
Shawty in my arm, she bad as hell
Your girl on my nuts, you mad as hell
She say she not a cheater
I hope you don't believe her
Zip zip zip
Onomatopoeia
Zipped yo chick
Now I'mma beat her
Got her in a bra and I'm fucking me a diva
Back to the club showing off my 8-ball
Burping it up 'till the drinks turn pink
A couple more shots, everyone freaks out
Now she's turned up with her butt cheeks out
Like blaaahhh
Bloooooo
What am I to do?
I came with all these bad bitches but screaming, "Look at you!"
Cause shawty got a bad body
I swear to God she gon make me sin
She got me all in her wallet
And she turn around she gon make me spin
I'm pulling these cards like Old Maid
Screaming out, "Fuck them old days!"
These gold chains, these gold shades
I'mma do my dance on em, okay

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Imagine going from unemployed to self-employed
To copping whips and trips, exclusive shit
All from making noise
And imagine crushing any girl you ever wanted
From the stuck up to the stunning
Popping that ass right in front of you
I'm DeStorm, I'm an icon
I'm a business, kinda like Sean
I do fitness, 'till they hop on
Then we fucking, with the lights on
Them hoes you only see and dream screaming, "I want you!"
Break out the colds, I'm coming through with 30 men like contra
It's that Forefront shit
Yeah, your boy run shit
You're on the wrong boat and I suggest you horse your shit
It started with four of us niggas
Now it's more of us, nigga
When it comes to loot, tell half the truth
Don't assume that you can trust niggas
I want those Dre, Jay, Bay, Ye, uncle Russ figures
No blanks I'm getting them real digits
My whole team punching them meal tickets
Now dance

[Hook w/DeStorm talking over]
Yeah
Now we eating
Fellahs, grab a girl
Ladies, find a man
It's time to do your dance
Now

[Verse 3]
I want everybody to look your haters in the eye
Now rock from side to side
And start eating that motherfucking wonton soup on 'em
They don't even know what to do now
Now smile at 'em
They gon start smiling back
They don't have no choice
Now reach out
Pull 'em really close to you
Whisper in their ear and say, "This dance is for you"
It's that Forefront shit
Yeah, your boy run shit
