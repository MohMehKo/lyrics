I know this girl named Ree
Who dated Mike and Ike
Till it all fell apart
Now Ree sees pieces of her life

Caught between him and him
Forgiving her was slim
She was a player
Crazy
Shady
Eminem

Stole both their hearts
Like it was a 100 grand
They couldn't understand
Why she couldn't love one man

So they spoiled her
In the finest restaurants and good bars
Shopping sprees on 5th Ave
Credit cards and good cars

Her best friend Dot
Told her she should slow down player
If you keep pushing
You'll get POPPED Now or Later

Trying to find a fast Payday
From these Airheads and dumb dumbs
But what's gonna happen when these peasants
Find out you playing em

[Refrain:]
I hope these Snickers don't find out about you
Hope these Snickers don't find out what you do
If these Snickers do find out about you
Girl you got a sweet tooth, shawty got a sweet tooth

So Mike heard about Ike
And wondered how his chick let
Two guys at the same time
Breaking off her Kit Kat

In her eyes
He was just a Sugar Daddy
Who wanted Sugar Babies
Ree simply wasn't happy

All men's joy is gone
Once a woman cheats
Transformed to a jawbreaker
Mike called up his Peeps

And all Ike hung around was
College Smarties and Nerds
So he couldn't retaliate once he
Once he got the word

She wanna mess with my head
Well I'm a twist hers
I'm a just get tools
I bet I won't miss hers

They all showed up
Same place same time
Guns ready to blow
POP ROCKS!
At the same time
Hah!

Mike pulled the trigger
Ike got Butterfingers
Ree jumped out the way
When she heard the shots ring out

Mike lived in Red Vines
And didn't know Ike personally
A junior meant to attend
One of the finest universities

Ree's the pitcher on the mound
But it's not all her fault
The type of girl who tricks guys
Till there's physical assault

These female heartbreakers
Must get tears all the time
Turning two jolly ranchers
To a lifetime of crime

[Refrain]

Yeah
When there's a will there's a way
That's all I gotta say

From New York to Cali
Catch me in the Valley
