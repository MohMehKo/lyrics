Yeah
Everybody that came from the basement with me
We living in the attic now
And just like Oprah Winfrey say
You get a car, you get a car yeah
Let's go

Waiting on a turn, we gonna run everything
There will come a time
When we living like Oprah Winfrey
Oprah Winfrey

Waiting on that time, when we run everything
And I promise my team when I get that cheddar
Everything out here gonna be better

I murder manure
I guess I'm killing shit
Straight from the sewer
That makes me really shit
Crossing my hands I'm dealing this
Stop looking like you ain't feeling this
Say I'd never make it to the top
I'ma show y'all lame motherfuckers what a ceiling is
Don't keep the master waiting
I'm feeling myself no masturbating
All them girls from my past relations
Coming back around it's fascinating
Why you haters mock the views up on my channel
I'm collecting more awards there's no more space up on the mantle
Realize that if they're jealous they just too afraid to test themselves
And far too close-minded to find the means to express themselves
And hating the world won't change the way you feel about yourself
But I'm pullin' for you like arms are missing listen here's some help
Cause I'ma keep rocking like keys
Ain't no dreaming of bees
Sink or swim I run this town I'll never drown
Michael Phelps
And while you living in the past talking about how great things used to be, uh
You had your shot but took an arrow to the knee

Waiting on a turn, we gonna run everything
There will come a time
When we living like Oprah Winfrey
Oprah Winfrey

Waiting on that time, when we run everything
And I promise my team when I get that cheddar
Everything out here gonna be better

Used to call the labels
But now the labels call
Used to sweat the ladies
But now my stable's full
I remember Shiela used to tell me years ago
That I would have millions of people screaming out DeStorm
And I didn't believe it couldn't conceive it
Now I'm paid in four
Went from sleeping on the floor to flying a family to the shore
Just won an AMA got the Grammys in my four
Cast I got last and do it all for Baltimore
It's that big frame kind of soar trained in the art of war
Rappers hungry but I'm sorry I'm what the people starving for
I started out doing covers, then killed a hundred challenges
Just so the fans won't ever question what true talent is
Now these kids can never honestly say they hate my music
I took the test of hip hop
I'm the father and I proved it
Unless you hating and hating ain't nothing but jealousy on steroids
A temporary fix for an instant cure, bitch

Waiting on a turn, we gonna run everything
There will come a time
When we living like Oprah Winfrey
Oprah Winfrey

Waiting on that time, when we run everything
And I promise my team when I get that cheddar
Everything out here gonna be better
Oprah Winfrey
Oprah Winfrey

From the basement to the attic now
And just like Oprah Winfrey say
You get a car, you get a car
Taking my entire team with me
We gonna all be stars
