[Intro: DeStorm]
Yeah (We've been arguing a lot, baby)
DeStorm (They say I'm not for you)
Right Side of the Tree (But I keep telling you it's worth it)
Hold on (Ain't nobody perfect)
Yo (Telling you it's worth it)
Adjust the bass a bit (But you know I can't be with you, you know)
That's better

[Verse 1: Right Side of the Tree]
When I looked up and I looked down
Little bit confused without you 'round
Little bit sick of this whole town
Thinking about packing my shit right now
I wanna run away but I don't know how
Things in the way, trying to hold me down
End of the day but I want this found
I can't be with you, you know

[DeStorm]
I'm convinced you're the one
Both in the blocks but I think I jumped the gun (hah)
And then you calling me foul
On some umpire shit calling me out (yeah)
And I'm calming you down
Miss one here you should be calling me now (now)
I hate that you get upset
But you can't tell a motherfucker's woo from a text (nope)
But you wrote in all caps (yeah)
Telling me you goin' back (where)
But that wouldn't be smart, girl (nah)
You can't leave without your heart, girl (nah)
Plus you got mine
You can't win a war fighting from the sideline (nope)
Mind over body, heart over mind
All of the above could be changed with time

[Hook: Right Side of the Tree & DeStorm]
You put a hex on me
You're always on my mind
I wish we took our time, girl
So we can do this right
I know somethings they never change
And I swear that we could do fine
You're the ones worth fighting for
You just have to give me some time (some time)
Have to get me some
Have to get me some
Have to get me some
Just have to get me some time (some time)
Have to get me some
Have to get me some
Have to get me some
Yeah, just have to get me some
Have to get me some
Have to get me some
Have to get me some
Just have to get me some time (some time)
Have to get me some
Have to get me some
Have to get me some

[Verse 2: DeStorm]
Yeah, and I still have doubts
Running out of strikes but I still have outs (I'm out)
And I could blame it on this music business
It gave me a start now I refuse to finish
Focusing on partying, booze, and tennis
Love is not for sale but I choose to rent it
I'm the landlord now, who's the tenant?
You waiting on my heart hoping you can to win it (win it)
Yeah, but you have to give me some time (some time)
I'm just clearing my mind (my mind)
All these feelings inside (inside)
Steady telling me otherwise
Yeah, and that I can't settle down
Another city, another girl, and another round
Feel a little better now
Maybe I'll come get you now
How sick is that?
Knowing if you run away, I could get you back
Nah, I don't wanna be that guy
I don't wanna have wings, I don't wanna be that fly
Why you giving me so much freedom?
I can see chains but I just don't need 'em
Birds keep coming and I'm just goin' feed 'em
Your words keep coming but I just don't heed 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Right Side of the Tree]
I can't be with you, you know
Don't see your face at my shows
What you wanted was yours
But what you wanted was mo' shit
But I don't blame you, I miss you
So please answer my wishes
And take my hand, come with me, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go
I never wanted to go

[Hook]
