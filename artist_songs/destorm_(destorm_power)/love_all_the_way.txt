[Intro]
I can no longer control it
It seemed to have taken over my mind, body, and soul
And I'm not sure I want to go back

[Verse 1]
Yes, this here's a story
For everyone who came before me
And just know I came much less for the fame
And more for the glory (Hah!)
And while the world may ignore me
My legs re-assure me
That if I sleep with it
Keep with it
Eat with it
Eventually the beats going to call me (ahh)
And I try to ignore it (ahh)
But when it got to the chorus (ahh)
It was screaming my name like a vein in my veins
And I just needed more, then (ahh)
And I tried to let go of it (why)
Is it consuming my world
Like a boy who met a girl
First time in love
Once your hearts in it
It's a hell of a drug
It's all that I know
The pressure is on me
Friends try to stop me
Folks try to warn me

[Hook]
Part of me
But it's part of me
But it's part of me
But it's part of me
I said part of me
But it's part of me
But it's part of me
Said it becomes part of me
Said part of me
But I'm gonna be
All that I can be
And if you don't believe
It's part of me
And I can't slow down

[Verse 2]
Yo
It's insaneing
I've been training
Blood, sweat, and tears
You can see my skin draining
And I accepted this to be my passion
The floors
The canvas
The rhythm
And the craftsman
And now my circle's getting smaller
Cause nobody believed when I said it was my calling
Heard it ringing and I answered it
Took it under my wing and I pampered it

Then uhh
Struggle came along
And I failed again
This time I gon' be strong
But I failed again
No, no, no
I just wanna grow, grow, grow

Uhh, yeah
Every single moment in time
There's at least one man smiling
As long as my feet are attached
Then I can walk more miles and
If I'm not fit for your land
I will be my own island
I will make my own noise
I will be my own silence
Once the rhythm's inside
You will see me rise
I'm no longer hiding
Touch the Heavens above
I'll call it love and you'll call it violence
Scream from the top of my lungs
History is made and I am going to write it
Generations from now
They'll see what I found and they will recite it
Yeah, that love can take you all the way (yeah)
That love can take you all the way (yeah)
That love can take you all the way
Yeah, that love can take you all the way
