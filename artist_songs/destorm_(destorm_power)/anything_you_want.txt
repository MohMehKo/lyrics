[Intro: DeStorm]
Yeah, uhh
Dedicated to
All the girls around the world
Wuz Up, Girl?

[Verse 1: DeStorm]
Have you ever seen the biggest mall in the world
I hear it's in Dubai
Baby we can fly
And you can shop 'till you drop
Don't stop when we get there
I have you popping tags
'Till your bags don't fit there
Coast to coast
No riding coach no mo'
You got a first class ass
So honey, don't sit there
You say you addicted to those new Louis Vuittons
You been checking out the spots
You came across on Groupon
Well, close your phone
Your savior's home
I understand you can't do it alone
So come on

[Hook: Christian Caldeira]
I'm much more than you bargained for
Baby you can have anything you want
Anything you want
Beach house sitting on the shore
Baby you can have anything you want
Anything you want
Top down and we're cruising through the city
I'll have you so fresh
Never felt so pretty before
We make love all day
Pop a bottle
Maybe catch you play [?]
Anything you want [x8]

[Verse 2: DeStorm]
If you ain't got yours
I'm giving you a piece of mine
And traffic only stops
If you can clearly see the sign
Put them bad years behind you
I'm working overtime
And baby you're a star
So I'm working on your shine
And it's mine, and it's mine
So I'm gonna spend it
You should change your name to trouble
Cause I'm always in it
Other niggas bragging what they do for you
But never left the coast
If they sick with it, beautiful
I guess I'm the host
So close your phone
Your savior's home
I understand you can't do it alone
So come on

[Hook]

[Bridge: Christian Caldeira]
I could be the man in your dreams
And life ain't alway what it seems
I'll be to take you around the world
It only takes two to make a team

[Verse 3: DeStorm]
And I promise that the drama
You experienced in your previous relationships
That made you sick
Will be replaced with crazy shit like
Freaking at a rodeo
Paris, then in Tokyo
We missed our flight
Can we do it one more time before we go?
So close your phone
Your savior's home
I understand you can't do it alone
So come on

[Hook]
