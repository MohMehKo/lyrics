[Intro]
Some lame said, "Uhhh
I ain't expecting much from this mixtape
Is it goin' be hot?"
Yeah, you know when I love a challenge
So, "Wuz Up, World?"
Welcome to the album

[Hook (x2)]
I'm a champion
Anything you say that can't be done
I'mma show the world it can be done
I'm living life of a champ
Of a champ
I'm a champion

[Verse 1]
Hey yo blast off
Cause I'm a rocket to my last breath
If I'm not your favorite rapper
Either you hating or your ass deaf
They can't see I'm making all the right plays
Like a bad ref
Not they can't stand me
Going Ramsay, mad chef
My cars black in hot sauce
I'm parked on fine with the top off
Got a couple dimes and their tops off
Come on give me my props dawg
In the bathroom start the supper club
Fucking get my rocks off
And she purposely left the locks off
Yeah, an exhibitionist
I screw it
Cause I'm the top dawg
I never say defeated
Unless of course I take my socks off
Got a better squad
With better bars that kill it with the pen
Well your starting team is tired
I suggest you tag 'em in
I'm just chilling, boy
Don't make me make a killing, boy
I'm not a dentist I don't care about your fillings, boy
Self-employed, mind and body both in sick shape
Compare me to the greats long before I drop this mixtape

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Triple threat
Do my own writing, voice on the hook
Now that I'm fucking up tradition
They can't help but be shook
I stack this paper, never spineless
Can't help but be booked
A million strong on the Tubes so you can't help but the look (uh huh)
I started out at point A and skipped B through Y
Did it my way this is why they screaming, "He too fly"
The best that ever done it
It ain't my fault you never heard of me
I guess it's time to open your mind, brain surgery
Shout out to the true fans that went and bought the album
To all the illegal downloads
Fuck it, same outcome
You ain't gotta tell me I'm the shit (I know)
I'm aware of that
Two hundred snapbacks on my rack
Collect 'em, stack, and wear 'em back
Handy cane in this rap game
DeStorm is where it's at
You want my spot, Flash?
Well fuck you, I ain't sharing that
Bottom of the first inning
Guess who's team is winning?
Second verse on the album
I'm already winning

[Hook]
