Was broke as shit in the projects
Where all the ballers rocking Louie
Nigga I just wanted a belt or a wallet
This that top notch shit

Louis Vuitton, Louis Vuitton
De what you doing you pronouncing it wrong
Asking me questions like boy what you on
Ho shut yo mouth and just just bounce to this song

Off a few months now I'm back on the throne
Took the award now get mack on the phone
These rappers are stupid I'm bout to be on
Call me George Lucas attack of the clones

Me and broke niggas do not get along
They stole it I'm pull it in back of my home
Yeah bitch we cool, but we can't be cool
Unless you know how to pack in a thong

On my third mixtape
I know yall niggas can't wait
I ain't bout to stop and when the album drop
I know yall niggas gone hate

Yall niggas better down, in a presence of a god now
Jesus or allah but I'm surely king kong
Hit you so hard you'll be nautious, proceed wit caution
I wish a nigga would like a coffin

You fucking wit a innovator, take her brain and integrate it
Made a million in a skating now my money generator
Shut up for my dinner plate up, even when I'm in my baiter
Mode I'mma go hard and go god I got my weight up

Louis Vuitton, Louis Vuitton Louis, Louis, Louis Vuitton [x4]

Louis Vuitton, Louis Vuitton
Last nigga stepped to me knew he was wrong
Who you leaning off on that new school shit
Who you scheming off for them Youtube hits

Come on
Are all the niggas that bad [x4]

I got a girl in every city
Even in the Serengeti
Pockets on two Vidcon in the hodgy train 
looking very pretty

Yeah the flo is legendary
Is all that hating necessary
Fucking me an African chick, thick thighs
Nice hips, huge tits calling up a titti

Yall niggas better down in a presence of a god now
Jesus or allah but I'm surely king kong
Hit you so hard make you nautious, proceed wit cautious
Now I speed it up like a auction

Committed to Miami, all these hoes wit me in a penny
Shoutout to 54 carrots stepping when I'm integrating
Ooh my wallet on terio
Living life in sterio

Louis Vuitton, Louis Vuitton Louis, Louis, Louis Vuitton [x4]

This shit crazy
Are all that niggas that bad [x4]

Louis Vuitton, Louis Vuitton Louis, Louis, Louis Vuitton [x4]
