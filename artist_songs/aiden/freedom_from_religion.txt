Hey father curse this man,
Reverse his view,
Indoctrinate his children,
Instill the guilt so deep.
The promise of shame
And heaven’s a lie.

We need freedom from religion now.
Oppression hate and thought crime.
We need freedom from religion now,
We’re better off without.

Hey preacher business man,
You fill your life
With dollar signs and trust.
The congregation weeps
You sell them lies,
I’ll tell you what we need.

Freedom from religion now.
Oppression hate and thought crime.
We need freedom from religion now,
We’re better off without.
Freedom from religion now.
Oppression hate and thought crime.
We need freedom from religion now,
We’re better off without a faith.
