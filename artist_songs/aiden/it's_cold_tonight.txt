Her eyes look cold. I see hate. 
This blade sunk deep inside your wrist, 
it's not worth fighting, just resist. 
With a knife, and a thought so sincere. 
Five times the pain so make it last 
don’t walk away, don’t walk so fast. 

Well I think I’ve lost my mind now, 
I know we’ve lost control 
but now we’ve got the time.

We’re going nowhere fast. 
Can you wake up from this world of ours? 
It's so cold tonight. 
We’re going nowhere fast. 
Can you wake up? Wake up, 
lets burn this whole place to the ground.

You look so good. Those black eyes. 
I know that now I’ve miss the boat, 
and helped in cutting my own throat. 
I’ve found the cure, 
I’ve found what’s holding us. 
Hold on tightly, oh so dear. 

Well I think I’ve lost my mind now. 
I know we’ve lost control 
but now we’ve got the time.

We’re going nowhere fast. 
Can you wake up from this world of ours? 
It's so cold tonight. 
We’re going nowhere fast. 
Can you wake up? Wake up, 
lets burn this whole place to the ground.

So now what’s next? 
You let the fire set you free. 
I know you’re already dead, 
but you promised me. 

Lets light this world. 
We’ll meet in the afterlife. 
Lets light this world, 
it's so cold tonight. 

All you need is fire and a friend to wish you well. 
Now wake up from this life.

We’re going nowhere fast. 
Can you wake up from this world of ours? 
It's so cold tonight. 
We’re going nowhere fast. 
Can you wake up? Wake up, 
lets burn this whole place to the ground.
