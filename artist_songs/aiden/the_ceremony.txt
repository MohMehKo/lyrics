He was obliged to feel the hate of all mankind
She was obliged to love him
But only ended up destroying his whole world
He felt the shame and wrote a long endearing letter
She felt obliged to burn it
But only ended up now falling back in love

Beneath the cemetery trees
(Let the empire fall)
She felt her arms begin to bleed
(Let the empire fall)
Her fate shared with the falling leaves
(Let the empire fall)
She can feel, she can feel the ceremony
(She can feel, she can feel the ceremony)
This is her ceremony

She was ashamed and felt betrayed by his salvation
He held the razor blades and loved beyond devotion
But only killing time is falling back in love

Beneath the cemetery trees
(Let the empire fall)
She felt her arms begin to bleed
(Let the empire fall)
Her fate shared with the falling leaves
(Let the empire fall)
She can feel, she can feel the ceremony
(She can feel, she can feel the ceremony)
This is her ceremony
(Let the empire fall)
This is her ceremony
(Let the empire fall)

He held her close, dying in his arms
She whispered her goodbye
Let the empire fall tonight

Beneath the cemetery trees
(Let the empire fall)
She felt her arms begin to bleed
(Let the empire fall)
Her fate shared with the falling leaves
(Let the empire fall)
She can feel, she can feel the ceremony
(She can feel, she can feel the ceremony)
