When the walls came tumbling down
Were you there to save me?
The cemetery gates cemetery gates
I’m still alive.

Be still the voice inside my head
Plan nine, walk among the dead
I’m insane.

In the eyes of recognition
I can feel the darkness,
The cemetery gates cemetery gates
I’m still alive.

In the end, we fall will you all shine?

You fall I’ll shine
You fall I’m still alive
You fall I’ll shine
You fall I’m still alive

In the end We Fall…
Will you all shine?
