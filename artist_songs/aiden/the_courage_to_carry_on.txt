Defy the one
The sinew of defining rage,
The fabric of a dying age,
In solitary madness I have found.

The courage to carry on
You brought the funeral light.
The courage to carry on
And I’ve got the skeleton for love.

Defy the son
The heir will be designing fate,
The errand of our shining hate,
In solitary madness I have found.

It’s only taken me ten years of fighting faithfully
This cause I can believe in too.
It’s not misery, life
The love is not me it’s you.

You got the courage to carry on
I got the courage, and some kind of hate.
