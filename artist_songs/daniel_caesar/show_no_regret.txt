Never forget
It's what you asked for
Show no regret
Show no regret

But at what cost
What am I giving up
But at what cost
I always find myself here

Give up the fight
You're not a winner
Move towards the light
Give up the fight

But at what cost
What am I giving up
But at what cost
I always find myself here

Show no regret

I am the world the world is me
With life, and peace, and harmony

This is your life...
