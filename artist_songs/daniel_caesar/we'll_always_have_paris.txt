[Daniel Caesar:]
Okay, okay, it's 3 am, I'm drunk as shit
I'm still in love I call you up sit on this
I know I'm terrible and you don't need all this
But you should love me too, forget these politics
Now in my dreams I'm in the east
Fuck you, I'm Humphrey Bogart
You're Miss Bergman and life is scored like God is Wolfgang Mozart
Never forget the times we had, those times I'll always cherish
Those times are gone but that's okay cause we'll always have Paris

We'll always have Paris

You must remember this
A kiss is just a kiss
A sigh is just is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply, as time goes by
Woke up in Paris
Now it's occupied
By Nazis and terrorists
Its time that we fly
Back to the motherland
Gestapo have them guns in hand
Back to the motherland
Gestapo have them motherfucking guns in hand

We'll always have Paris

[Sean Leon:]
So passive aggressive, always masking aggression, I was at your discretion
I send you flowers in hours, 'been planning my hours dressing
I'm borderline obsessing, how I'm your new obsession?
You're in my session, we're blowing time, and we smoke a session
Your man is never mentioned, although he always texting
You feel inclined sometimes, but never find the time to text him
I think he got the message, know how your lies affect him
I provide a Paris...
Huh, Paris in the morning, for appointments, but that's ordinary nigga
Hey babe if you're so bad why you be fucking all these ordinary niggas?
They tryna hold you back I'm on a wave I'm tryna put you on
Yeah, your boy done been on fire, I'm on a wave I'm tryna put you
Oh yeah...
Paris
