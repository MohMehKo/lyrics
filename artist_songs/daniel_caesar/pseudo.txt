Belmonts and bottles
DB9 full throttle
I feel like I'm drifting away
The pseudo life ain't bad, as they say
Thinking about fucking
Backpage, it's nothing
I'm dreaming of a better dayÂ 
The pseudo life ain't bad as they say
If I should die before I wake
Thank God I left this pseudo place
All I love and all I am
Is not in sync with God's great plan
After all is said and done
I pray that we at least had fun
And if I never penetrate
God take my life for goodness sake
Pseudo, pseudo
Welcome to my funeral
Pseudo, pseudo
Welcome to my funeral
