Baby let me fuck your mind
I promise I'll do it softly
Afterwards we'll buy cigarettes and coffee
I swear I that I have demons inside me
They're telling me that I'm the greatest thing since Hammurabi
They're fucking with me
I wish that I could spend my day singing and smoking
Marijuana on the counter I ain't joking
Medulla oblongata I'm an impulse
You shouldn't have to think too hard to love me
Though I'm sinful

Let me make love to your mind...
