We don't say enough
We don't stay in love, my brothers

What the fuck is up?
What the fuck is up?

I don't say my prayers when I wake up
I don't call my mommy enough

What the fuck is up?
What the fuck is up?

Guess I'll go to Heaven
In a little rowboat
It's better there

The powers that be
They won't let us see
What we really are
What's beyond the stars

Guess I'll go to Heaven
In a little rowboat
It's better there

Enlighten up, my friends
Enlighten up, my friends
Enlighten up, my friends
Enlighten up, my friends
