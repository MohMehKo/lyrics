Baby, I have to leave you for a while
My wardrobe's looking pretty shabby
Baby daddies
And baby mamas
Have sexual karma over me

Birds of paradise...

Alexandra, I have to tell you how I feel
My mind is going and time is slowing
Diana's growing
And I'm just pouring
Up the bottles
Time to die

Birds of paradise...
