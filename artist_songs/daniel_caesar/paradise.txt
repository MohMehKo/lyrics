[Daniel Caesar:]
I gotta make something for myself, myself
Don't forget you chose this life
Welcome to your paradise
Lay in your bed, reap what you sow
Welcome to your paradise

I used to stand on the rocks, I used to stand on the rock
On the Rock of Gibraltar
Father told me I faltered
Picking fights with my pops
He asked forgiveness a lot
But I don't need God's forgiveness
Can I get me a witness

I could cry, but I gotta pick my battles tonight, tonight
I could cry, I'll be fighting for the rest of my life, my life

Don't forget you chose this life
Welcome to your paradise
Lay in your bed, reap what you sow
Welcome to your paradise

[Sean Leon:]
Do you wanna be your father? Or do you wanna take it farther
Leave the woman that you'd break your heart for at the altar
Cause you were offered a life that you would trade your heart for
Ain't gotta die to see heaven, I got your heaven nigga
Would rather rev on an engine than ever reverend, nigga
Black sheeps packing weapons in 911's, nigga
How could worship be worth it?
You love your God like yourself
So you deserve to be perfect
You deserve for your car to skirt and your girl to be skirtless
Fuck on a Saturday nigga, miss Sunday service
You made you a hundred verses, a hundred verses
That's why you need you a hundred virgins, a hundred virgins
Yeah, you wear your crown with a frown sometimes
You can't help but feel down at times
You were raised in the basement
You used to pray on your spaceship

[Daniel Caesar:]
I gotta make something for myself, myself
If you want to get this money, come and join me
If you want to get this money, come and join me
If you want to get this money, come and join me
If you want to get this money, come and join me
