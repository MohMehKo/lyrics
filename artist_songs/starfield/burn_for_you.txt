Can my prayers be heard over all the noise?
Can my life still count, can I have a voice?
Could you use this faith in your master plan,
use these simple words, use these willing hands?

If you can, then here I am

I'll burn, burn like a fire
I'll burn, with love and desire
I'll burn, I'll burn for you
I'll burn for you

Can you lead me Lord in the every day?
Teach me discipline, teach me to obey
Can you show me where I can be Your light
as I walk with You, through the trials of life?

If you can, then here I am

I'll burn, Burn like a fire
I'll Burn, with love and desire
I'll Burn, I'll Burn for You
I'll Burn, burn like a fire
I'll Burn, to lift You higher
I'll Burn, I'll Burn for You

I wanna feel the fire
I wanna feel the flames
I wanna burn forever
I wanna burn for Your name
