Say the words and I will listen
Show Your way, impart Your wisdom
open up my ears to hear, open up my ears to hear

Speak now Jesus, speak into my heart
I am desperate to hear Your still small voice
I need to hear Your voice

The noise of life is overwhelming
Drowning out the truth that I need
Open up my ears to hear, open up my ears to hear

Speak now Jesus, speak into my heart
I am desperate to hear Your still small voice
I need to hear Your voice
Lead me Jesus, I need direction
I am so lost, without You guiding me.
I need to know Your peace.

When you speak I'll listen
Where you lead I'll go

Speak now Jesus, speak into my heart
I am desperate to hear Your still small voice
I need to hear Your voice
Lead me Jesus, I need direction
I am so lost, without You guiding me.
I need to know Your peace.
