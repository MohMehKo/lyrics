Lover of my soul 
I want to tell you 
Only you have all of me 
I cannot contain my adoration 
I'm in love so desperately 

No one is as lovely as you are 
There is no one else who has my heart 

Jesus you have me completely 
Every breath I breathe 
I am absolutely in love 
Jesus I am yours forever 
All of me surrenders 
I am absolutely in love with you 

Down upon my knees 
I'm lost in worship 
Humbled by your majesty 
What is there to say 
But how I love you 
Thank you for forgiving me 

No one is as lovely as you are 
There is no one else who has my heart 

Jesus you have me completely 
Every breath that I breathe 
I am absolutely in love 
Jesus I am yours forever 
All of me surrenders 
I am absolutely in love with you 

All I am is yours (all I am is yours) 
Only yours 

Jesus you have me completely 
Every breath that I breathe 
I am absolutely in love 
Jesus I am yours forever 
All of me surrenders 
I am absolutely in love 
Jesus you have me completely 
Every breath that I breathe 
I am absolutely in love with you 
In love with you
