This is my heart's condition 
This world has ammunition 
To tear me down and steal my life away 
I know there's more than this 
More than temptation's kiss 
So lift me up and give me strength to say 

I will live 
I will live for you 
I will live 
I will live for you 

I've had the revelation 
This is my declaration 
More of you oh God and less of me 
Cause you are my new existence 
I offer no resistance 
I'm running to the one I know I need 

I will live 
I will live for you 
I will live 
I will live for you 

How could I walk away 
How could I walk away 
How could I walk away 

I will live 
I will live for you 
I will live 
I will live for you 
(I will not walk away from you) 
I will live for you 
(I will not walk away from you) 
I will live for you 
(I will not walk away from you)
