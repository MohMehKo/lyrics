This is an invitation to overwhelm my heart 
I'm asking you to meet me 
I'm waiting here to start 
My soul is like a desert 
Thirsty for your rain 
So open up the heavens 
And fill me up again 
I'm ready for my life to be consumed 

Father here I am 
Overwhelm, Overwhelm 
Only your love can 
Overwhelm, Overwhelm 
Let your spirit fall 
Overtaking all 
Overwhelm, overwhelm, overwhelm, overwhelm me 

Desperate for your presence 
I long for you alone 
So Dwell within me Jesus 
This temple is your home 
I'm ready for this life to be consumed 

Father here I am 
Overwhelm, Overwhelm 
Only your love can 
Overwhelm, Overwhelm 
Let your spirit fall 
Overtaking all 
Overwhelm, overwhelm, overwhelm, overwhelm, 
Overwhelm, overwhelm, overwhelm, overwhelm me 

Father here I am 
Overwhelm, Overwhelm 
Only your love can 
Overwhelm 

Father here I am 
Overwhelm, Overwhelm 
Only your love can 
Overwhelm, Overwhelm 
Let your spirit fall 
Overtake it all 
Let your spirit fall 
Overtake it all 
Overwhelm, overwhelm, overwhelm, overwhelm, 
Overwhelm, overwhelm, overwhelm, overwhelm me
