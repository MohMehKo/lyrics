You're the wonder and the mystery 
You're the melody that must be sung 
We rejoice with all those who believe 
You're the song that was and is to come 

Glory is rising 
Yeah glory is rising 
Beautiful beautiful the sound 
Of redemption's song 
Moving through the crowd 
Singing great is our god 
Your children crying out 
Beautiful beautiful the sound 

From the earth our voices will ascend 
As an offering to you alone 
May our praises echo without end 
Join the angel choir around the throne 

Glory is rising 
Yeah glory is rising 
Beautiful beautiful the sound 
Of redemption's song 
Moving through the crowd 
Singing great is our god 
Your children crying out 
Beautiful beautiful the sound 

Beautiful beautiful the sound 
Of redemption's song 
Moving through the crowd 
Singing great is our god 
Your children crying out 
Beautiful beautiful the sound 
Beautiful the sound
