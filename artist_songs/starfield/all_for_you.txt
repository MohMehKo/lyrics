Nothing compares to
Life I have in You
Nothing of this world satisfies 
So, I want to let go
I want to let You know
All that I have to give is Yours 

Here I am
As gold to the fire
I will surrender to Your hand
To this place 
Lord, I have come ready for Your touch

It's all for You 
It's all for You
I'm letting go
I'm letting go

What is it in me
That hangs on for so long
Why do I fight the tears that come?
I work so hard to
Keep in control when
All that I want is to let go

I'll take this life
And lay it down
I'm letting go
I'm letting go
My hopes and dreams 
Here at Your feet
I'm letting go
I'm letting go

And I am ready for Your life
And I am ready for You now
