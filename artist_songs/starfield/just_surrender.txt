Life is hard and I know you're trying
You wear a smile but inside you're crying
When will you admit, you'll never make it on your own
You build the walls up all around you
To protect you from the hurt you've been through
I'm the only one who can bring the walls to the ground

Lay down your defenses, put your trust in Me

I can heal your heart
I can comfort you
Don't resist my love
Just surrender
I see your scars
and I feel your fear
Let me rescue you
Just Surrender, Just Surrender

You keep denying my advances
But you'll never be out of chances
My love will follow you no matter how far you run
Let me show you what you can be
what it's like to live this life free
Will you take my hand and let me lead you my child

Lay down your defenses, put your trust in Me

I can heal your heart
I can comfort you
Don't resist my love
Just surrender
I see your scars
and I feel your fear
Let me rescue you
Just Surrender, Just Surrender

Open up your heart and let me in
There's nothing left to fear
