I cannot be broken
I cannot be tamed
my tongue is a fire and my words are a flame
I will burn and wither
I will stop for none
my will is a drought and my ego the sun

I'm the Raging Sea
I'm the bending trees
an unstoppable force with wake of debris
I'm the wind and rain
the loss and the pain
without You, I'm a natural disaster

I will drown the city
I am out for blood
the levee's my conscience, and my pride is a flood
I'm a vicious cycle, always the same
when the storm has passed
just emptiness and sorrow remain

I'm the Raging Sea
I'm the bending trees
an unstoppable force with wake of debris
I'm the wind and rain
the loss and the pain
without You, I'm a natural disaster

I'm a Natural Disaster,
I'm a Natural Disaster, I'm coming on faster,
I'm a Natural Disaster, I'm coming on faster,
There's nowhere to turn nowhere to hide,
nowhere to Run, Run, Run, Run
