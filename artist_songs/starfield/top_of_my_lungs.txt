Don't let your mind deny what your heart believes 
Leave your inhibitions let your soul be free 
This is why you were created it's your destiny 
It's alright it's alright it's alright 

Who the son sets free yeah they are free indeed 
So let go with me come on and sing what you believe 

We're gonna shout his praise at the top of our lungs 
We're gonna dance for the glory of the risen son 
We're not ashamed not ashamed of the one we love 
We're gonna shout his praise at the top of our lungs 

This is the praise of a people that have been redeemed 
This is the joy of the lord and the sound of the free 
This is why we were created it's our destiny 
It's alright it's alright it's alright 

Who the son sets free yeah they are free indeed 
So let go with me come on and sing what you believe 

We're gonna shout his praise at the top of our lungs 
We're gonna dance for the glory of the risen son 
We're not ashamed not ashamed of the one we love 
We're gonna shout his praise at the top of our lungs [x3]
