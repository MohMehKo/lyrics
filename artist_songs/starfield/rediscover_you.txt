I need to just admit 
my faith is paper thin 
I'm feeling so burned out 
On religion 

I say an empty prayer 
I sing a tired song 
I need to just admit that the passion's gone 

And I want to get it back 

You told me 
Look for You and I will find 
So I'm here 
Like I'm searching for the first time 
Revive me, Jesus 
Make this cold heart start to move 
Help me rediscover You 

I want to learn to pray 
The way that David prayed 
I want my soul to burn when I hear Your name 
I want to feel like new 
I want to hunger for you 
Bring me back to life like only You can do 
Cause I don't want to stay the same 

You told me 
Look for You and I will find 
So I'm here 
Like I'm searching for the first time 
Revive me, Jesus 
Make this cold heart start to move 
Help me rediscover You 

Lord, I want to be Yours today 
I want to know the passion of the saints 
And how they were changed 

You told me 
Look for You and I will find 
So I'm here 
Like I'm searching for the first time 
Revive me, Jesus 
Make this cold heart start to move 

I want to burn for You 
Bring me back to life, Jesus 
Help me rediscover You
