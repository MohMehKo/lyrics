I see the King of Glory
Coming on the clouds with fire
The whole earth shakes
The whole earth shakes

I see His love and mercy
Washing over all our sin
The people sing
The people sing

Hosanna, hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna, hosanna
Hosanna in the highest

I see a generation
Rising up to take their place
With selfless faith
Selfless faith

I see a near revival
Stirring as we pray and sing
We're on our knees
On our knees

[Chorus]

Heal my heart and make it clean
Open up my eyes to the things unseen
Show me how to love like you
Have loved me

Hosanna, hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna, hosanna
Hosanna in the highest

[Repeat]

Hosanna in the highest
(Hosanna)
