Oh Oh Oh
We have come to testify
Oh Oh Oh
Our God is surely Great
Oh Oh Oh
His love is like a river wide
So let everyone beneath His skies
Lift their voice and sing

For the Kingdom of our God
Carries on
Carries on
Carries on

Oh Oh Oh
His kingdom is inside of you
Oh Oh Oh
Itâ€™s everywhere you are
Oh Oh Oh
Celebrate your life made new
Come on let His freedom bloom
Lift your voice and sing

For the Kingdom of our God
Carries on
Carries on
Carries on

Everybody sing Hallelujah
