I don't want fake, I'm tired of counterfeit
all this plastic love, man I want none of it
I don't want fake, I just can't take it anymore
I won't be satisfied, until you are by my side

All I want is You, All I want is You
I just can't live for another
All I want is You

I won't be romanced, by any other love
Cause' what Iâ€™ve got will always be enough
I won't be romanced, I won't take the chance on any other love
I won't be satisfied, until you are by my side

All I want is You, All I want is You
I just can't live for another
All I want is You
