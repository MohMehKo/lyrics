Take me and invade me
Make me someone new
Wake me from the dead 
And break me with the truth

Move me and disturb me
Interrupt my peace
Tear open my heart
And pull me to my knees

There's a world outside
That is burning
While I'm turning blinded eyes
While I stand by

I won't survive
To live this ordinary life
I'm not alive
To live this ordinary life

And I will try
To see this world I live in 
With Your eyes 
To love this world You've given
With my life
To see this world I live in 
With Your eyes 
To love this world You've given
With my life
