I was sinking, so deep in sin
Your grace and mercy, decided to take me in
And placed my feet on, a rock to stand
It's unbelievable I'm not the same man
That use to fuss
Dance at the clubs and cuss
Mixed up true love with lust
And got my flesh in some stuff
That should have taken me out
Now I can shout about 
The fact that I'm still here

(Everybody say this)

I'm still here [repeat]
Through the rain I'm
Through the pain I'm
Through the tears I'm
In every fear

He promised to never leave me
Nor forsake me and if the devil could kill me 
He would have done it by now

(I'm still)

Holding on
To His hands
Standing strong
Can't comprehend
Why He would love me and keep me
Stand above me and and treat me
As if I'm cool enough to be called his friend

And He still use me
Even though I know I don't deserve it
He still choose me
To perform His works 
Although I'm not worth it
And like Peter I denied Him
More than I can count but God's love
Refused to fail me and He always bailed me out

Yeah

I'm still here [repeat]

No weapon formed against me
Can ever prosper
Cause I'm
More than a conqueror through 
Christ yeah

Through the rain I'm
Through the pain I'm
Through the tears I'm
In every fear

He promised to never leave me
Nor forsake me and if the devil could kill me 
He would have done it by now

Shots fired in the club parking lot
Hearts stomp as innocent bodies drop 
That day I get pulled over by the cops
My cousins sweating bullets 
With a pocket full of rocks
God kept me 
Never left me
And He's worthy of all the honor
And the glory

I'm still here [repeat]
Through the rain I'm
Through the pain I'm
Through the tears I'm
In every fear

He promised to never leave me
Nor forsake me and if the devil could kill me 
He would have done it by now
