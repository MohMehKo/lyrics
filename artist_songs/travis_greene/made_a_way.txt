Made a way
Don't know how but you did it
Made a way

Standing here not knowing how we'll get through this test
But holding onto faith you know best
Nothing can catch you by surprise
You've got this figured out and you're watching us now

But when it looks as if we can't win
You wrap us in your arm and step in
And everything we need you supply
You got this in control
And now we know that

You made a way
When our backs were against the wall
And it looked as if it was over
You made a way
And we're standing here
Only because you made a way
You made a way

Now we're here
Looking back on where we come from
Because of you and nothing we've done
To deserve the love and mercy you've shown
But your grace was strong enough to pick us up

And you made a way
When our backs were against the wall
And it looked as if it was over
You made a way
And we're standing here
Only because you made a way

You made a way
When our backs were against the wall
And it looked as if it was over
You made a way
And we're standing here
Only because you made a way

You move mountains
You cause walls to fall
With your power
Perform miracles
There is nothing that's impossible
And we're standing here
Only because you made a way

You move mountains
You cause walls to fall
With your power
Perform miracles
There is nothing that's impossible
And we're standing here
Only because you made a way

You move mountains
You cause walls to fall
With your power
Perform miracles
There is nothing that's impossible
And we're standing here
Only because you made a way

And we're standing here
Only because you made a way

And we're standing here
Only because you made a way

You made a way
You made a way
You made a way
You made a way

Don't know how but you did it
Made a way
Don't know how but you did it
Made a way

Don't know how but you did it
Don't know how but you did it
Don't know how but you did it
Don't know how but you did it

Don't know why but I'm grateful
Don't know why but I'm grateful
Don't know why but I'm grateful

Don't know why but I'm grateful
Don't know why but I'm grateful

And we're standing here
Only because you made
And we're standing here
Only because you made a way
And we're standing here
Only because you made
