Everyone needs grace
Your love is enough now
By Your name we're saved
Looked beyond our wrong
Saw just what we need
We are alive now
By Your name we're free

Now I'm up again with You
You got up so I could get up again
You got up so I could get up again

I'm up with You You
I'm up with You-ooh ooh-ooh
