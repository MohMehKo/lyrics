The Hill... Hill... Hill

Sin around me
Pain is in me
Stress is on me
But I gotta keep looking up

Tears are streaming
Heart is beating
Others leaving
But I gotta keep looking up

Some will trust in horses and chariots
But I will look to the hills and I will not fear
Some may say that they found another way
But my eyes are on you and I will not move from...
The Hill... The Hill... Hill

Trouble has found me
Pressure is crowding
People doubting
But I gotta keep looking up

Ground is shaking
Walls are breaking
And my heart is racing
But I gotta keep looking

Some will trust in horses and chariots
But I will look to the hill and I will not fear
Some may say that they found another way
But my eyes are on you and I will not move ...

Some may trust in horses and chariots
But I will look to the hill and I will not fear
Some may say that they found another way
But my eyes are on you and I will not move

On the hill there's a cross
On the cross there is blood for me for me [x4]

Thank you for your blood Jesus [x2]
Thank you for your blood
For you washed away my sins
Nothing but the blood

Oh Precious [x2]
Oh precious is that blood on the hill

On the hill there's a cross
On the cross there is blood for me...for me
[x4]

He still has the power
Wonderful power
To heal our diseases
To cover our weakness
[x2]

He still has the power
Wonderful power
To heal our diseases
To cover our weakness
[x4]

Still has the power
Wonderful power
To heal our diseases
To cover our weakness
[x2]

On the hill there's a cross on the cross there is blood for me [x2]

The cross don't discriminate
The cross don't discriminate
The cross don't discriminate no..
There's blood for you
There's blood for you too
