You came out of your way
You sat down to speak to me
What amazing grace
That you've shown - so patiently

And you, waited for me
Just for me
For me

You called out my name
Knew my past
Covered my shame
This amazing grace
You've shown - so patiently

And You, you waited for me
Just for me, Oh
You, you waited for me
Just for me, for me

Where would I be
If you left me God

You waited
Waited
