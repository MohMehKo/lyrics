Sit at the gate for my next flight
Look down on my phone got a text like
Thanks for everything, had the best night
Had to start a new chapter in my sex life
I was in love way before she undressed
Every woman looks better in a sun dress
I was scared to speak, I must confess
I'm anxious always make the first move unless
She like to drink whiskey
Like then I can taste when she kiss me
And she dance like she fucking she got a man
And if I got a girl will she understand?
Put your hand in my hand I'll be dancing
One night stand, no second chancing
I don't got all night like plans man
Underneath white sheets romancing

One time for the one night stands
Two times if you do it for the fans
Three times if you just wanna dance
Fuck you I ain't got no plans

One time for the one night stands
Two times if you do it for the fans
Three times if you just wanna dance
Fuck you I ain't got no plans

One time for the one night stands
Fuck you I ain't got no plans

One time for the one night stands

Year later when I'm back in the same town
Call home girl up and she came down
Club was packing it was a good show
She watched the whole thang from the front row
Honestly what's up with her friend
She a 8 but her girl is a 10
Shallow as fuck and want an upgrade
Up works, I don't know what the fuck to say
So I take them both backstage
A threesome's just so cliche
Hold to her like every other day
Hoe's bore but I did it anyway
I turn into hate that it's an 18
Some days you wake up and do great things
I don't give a fuck and just say things
Says that immerse but that's the 18

One time for the one night stands
Two times if you do it for the fans
Three times if you just wanna dance
Fuck you I ain't got no plans

One time for the one night stands
Two times if you do it for the fans
Three times if you just wanna dance
Fuck you I ain't got no plans

Fuck you I ain't got no plans

Fuck you I ain't got no plans

One time for the one night stands
Two times if you do it for the fans

One time for the one night stands
