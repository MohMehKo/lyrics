This is our moment
Now we both agree
You said you love me - finally

Do not breath too deep
And chance the moment
No way do not blink
Oh

I can not blink for fear
That you might somehow disappear
I will not blink
Oh hell I try to keep you here

Blink
Blink
Blink
Blink

When you smile
Spinning on the steps
My begging heart is soothing girl

Do not breath too deep
And chance the moment
No way do not blink
Oh

I can not blink for fear
That you might somehow disappear
I will not blink
Oh hell I try to keep you here

Blink
Blink
