I'm lying on my side and I'm wondering when will it all collapse
I'm lying to myself if I said that I'm never coming back
Can't remember all the things that you said, or the reasons why I left
But now this room is spinning while I'm trying just to fill in all the gaps

You're so used to walking away
And I'm left here on my own
I never listen to what they say
But you're already gone
Yeah, you're already gone
You're already gone
You're already gone
You're gone
You're gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone...

Lying on my side and I'm wondering when will it all collapse
You're gone
You're gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone...

Lying on my side and I'm wondering when will it all collapse
I lie here on my own when you're gone, but you're never coming back
And every time I'm down and out, I think of what we had
So now I'm driving round in circles trying to fill in all the gaps

You're so used to walking away
And I'm left here on my own
I never listen to what they say
But you're already gone
Yeah, you're already gone
You're already gone
You're already gone
You're gone
You're gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone...

Lying on my side and I'm wondering when will it all collapse
You're gone
You're gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone...

Yeah, you're already gone
You're already gone
You're already gone
You're gone
You're gone
