You see I grew up as a wild child, played by my own rules
Stubborn as a motherfucker, I don’t wanna go to school
Math class is boring, recess is old news
I just wanna chill and have fun like them older dudes
And so I did, and I never gave in
With my back to the wind and a goofy old grin
I was out for the sting, where I wanted I went
When they told me I’d lose, I just told them I’d win
And I snuck out of class, headed down the road
Ventured on home, call me Indiana Ommz
Said I’d never look back, I’d just set my own path
I don’t need a game plan, I can get my own map
'Til girl meets boy and boy meets girl
Never would have thought that she would change his world
I remember that day, when we met up in the rain
She just looked me in the eyes, and she said one thing

I remember that day when we met up in the rain
She just looked me in the eyes and she said one thing

Yeah

Yeah

Don’t you see what I am? See what I’m doing?
This is my life, don’t you see what I’ve ruined?
Drowned my gift, dropped my faith
Forgot my dream, I’ve lost my way
And there’s nobody to blame, nobody to go to
I was doing fine, why the fuck did I involve you?
Ready as I am I would never get the chance
To show you what I dreamt cause you’d never understand
I’m a cowboy by night, raider by the day
If I can find a saloon, I can find my way
Earn my living with my outlaw winnings
Y’all could spend it all with me but I just can’t stay
Now everything’s gone, everything’s lost
Promising to God, I’ve paid my cost
Never would’ve thought that she’d ever let us go
But she’s missing in my heart, I can feel it in my soul

I remember that day when we met up in the rain
She just looked me in the eyes and she said one thing

Yeah

Yeah

What’s wrong? Who cares? So long, cold stare
I’ve been wrong about everything, you owed me
And if I had another chance to try it all again
Then you know you’d be looking at the old me
So if there’s anything left — anything at all
Let me write that song that'll put you in my arms
I can see you’re a star, but please don’t shoot
Please, at the least, let me speak my truth
“Too little too late,” she whispered in the wind
I wish you'd never left, this shouldn’t be the end
She always on my mind when I’m thinking in my zone
When there’s nothing left to drink and I’m sitting here alone
The cards are on the table, the odds are looking grim
Indebted to regret, there’s no profit in the win
I told her what she meant, just hope she remembers that
I sent it with a prayer but she never wrote a letter back
