It's just another Monday
Boy, don't make me ill
Life conscious, be fun, babe
Yeah, really that's your deal
So you stay in here then
I won't be home too late
Addicted to pleasure
Gone two nights and a day

Yes, I'm too hot to handle it
I'm too hot to handle
I'm too hot to handle it
Yes, I'm too hot to handle

Oh, blame it on the moonlight
Just blame it on my youth
I blame it on the starsign
That's our only truth

I can wait, but not forever
Shut up, but not for long
A good life, but not forever
Come close my eyes
I love until I hate it
I breathe until I burn
My mantra wants me facing
I walk through love
Oh, hey

Yes, I'm too hot to handle it
I'm too hot to handle
I'm too hot to handle it
Yes, I'm too hot to handle

Oh, blame it on the moonlight
Just blame it on my youth
I blame it on the starsign
That's our only truth

That's our only truth
That's our only truth
That's our only truth
That's our only truth
(Truth, truth, truth...)

Oh, blame it on the moonlight
Just blame it on my youth
I blame it on the starsign

Blame it on the moonlight, blame it on my youth
Blame it on the starsign, that's our only truth
Blame it on the moonlight, blame it on my youth
Blame it on the starsign, starsign
