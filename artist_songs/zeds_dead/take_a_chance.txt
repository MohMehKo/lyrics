Take a chance
Always lived life with a risky plan
Never would've thought that it'd get so sad
Life's a joke. Does it make you {hahaha}[?]
I be in the sky
I be on some shit that'll make you fly
It's all for the ride
Why feel low when you can feel high?
Why feel low when you can feel high?
It's the world that we live in
It's all too dull, and it's all too vivid
Everything wrong but the world keep spinnin'
And if I were king it would all be different
Wish I coulda made you proud
It's too bad how things turned out
Hands on your head
Face to the ground
Try to get up and I shut you down

[Hook x2:]
I be in the sky
I be on some shit that'll make you fly
It's all for the ride
Why feel low when you can feel high?
Why feel low when you can feel high?

Mr. Doubtful didn't they
Mr. Doubtful didn't they tell
Mr. Doubtful didn't they tell you
There's demons up in the ceiling, and they say that they're here to help you

Close your eyes
Why feel low when you can feel high?
Close your eyes
Why feel low when you can feel high?

[Hook]

Let it crawl through your veins
Let it be, let it breathe
Let it alter your brain
Let it wash away
Let it take your breath
Let it cause you pain
I've watched you change
There's no where safe just walk away
I've seen ya scheme
I've watched your hand
I've lost your game
Say, lets play ball
Aim for the stars, winner takes all
Take it to the top, and then watch them fall
Don't be alarmed, that's who you are
What a thing to say
Everything to lose, and nothing to gain
Looking for the sun, but you end up in the rain
Truth be told that's everyday

[Hook x2]
