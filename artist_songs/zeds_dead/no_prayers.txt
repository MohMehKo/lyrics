Sister Bessie don't you say no prayers for me
A slow boat's gonna lead me where I'm bound
I'm far to travel far across the distant sea
My destiny will lead me where I'm bound
[x2]

I came with nothing but thoughts from another planet
A heart that you'll never break, and a dream that you can't imagine
I'm far from average, I doubt that you understand it
I put my pain in the paint, and put it all on the canvas
Painted a picture so vivid that I envisioned my life without any limit and try my hardest to live it
I am a dreamer, you see it in my demeanor
I'll be this way to death and take it up with the reaper
And through the speaker you'll hear it without a doubt
Like I don't question a thing that's coming out of my mouth
Just say the word, I'll tell you what I'm about
They trying to get in my head, and I'm just trying to get out
So it's official, just sign the line with and initial
No matter what you get done, they always try to dismiss you
It ain't a issue, I'll ever care to attend to
I'm out of your fucking league, so I don't need to convince you
What's up? [x2]

My destiny will leave me where I'm bound [x2]

Sister Bessie don't you say no prayers for me
A slow boat's gonna lead me where I'm bound
I'm far to travel far across the distant sea
My destiny will lead me where I'm bound

These haters lining up, go 'head and try my bluff
They seem to multiply, but ain't dividing us
They hate to see us shine, they hate the sight of us
When Zeds sent me the beat, they told me light it up
And let the ambers glow, I'm in the Amazon
This game changed my approach, I'm like an animal
Success is bound to bring it, they hate the fact you're winning
They jealous of it all, they envy that you live it
That's why I play the villain, just trying to excite the story
Somebody gotta do it, so I ain't saying sorry
Gotta be number one, knew that since I was young
So you could save your pity, cause I ain't fucking done
Now I don't sleep, I only trust the deceased
You try and bring it to me, there's something you better see
I am a beast, it's time that you let it be
I'm taking it to the moon, so I am out of your reach, motherfucker

My destiny will leave me where I'm bound [x3]
