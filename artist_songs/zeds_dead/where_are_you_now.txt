You flip my mind up, upside down
The words sink in but they, they won't come out
I've been blinded, I've been trying to get to you
You've been hiding, and I want the truth, oh

Where are you now?
Whoa whoa (yeah), whoa whoa (yeah), whoa whoa (yeah)
Yeah, where are you now?
Where are you now?

I don't know where you've been
I don't know where you've gone, no
But I know where you belong
Yes, I know where you belong

Where are you now?
But I know where you belong
Yes, I know where you belong

I don't know where you've been
I don't know where you've gone, no
But I know where you belong
Baby my heart is, my heart is your home

Nobody knows you, not like me
You've got two good eyes but you, you still don't see
That you've been blinded, I've been trying to get to you
You've been hiding, and I want the truth, oh

Where are you now?
Whoa whoa (yeah), whoa whoa (yeah), whoa whoa (yeah)
Yeah, where are you now?
Where are you now?

I don't know where you've been
I don't know where you've gone, no
But I know where you belong
Yes, I know where you belong

Where are you now, where are you now?
But I know where you belong
Yes, I know where you belong
Where are you now, where are you now?
