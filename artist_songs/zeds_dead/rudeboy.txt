What you know about a self-employed maniac?
The Devil took me in and now he pray to God to take me back
We at the bar fronting like we some stars
And trying to pick up on some broads but they don’t know who we are
Yo Zeds Dead looking tipsy T-Dot I know you with me
We some alcoholics, gotta rep it for my fucking city
Well thank y’all, I like to think I tried
Look into my eyes then you looking at a homicide
I’m just kidding dummy I just wanna party y’all
You know Omes ? Patron, I’m just trying to keep it going
The boy banned from Kuwait to Japan
I crush the game in my hand and now they know who I am

[Hook:]
What I want, when I want it
Tryin to tell me that I'm wrong
What I want, when I want it
I don't wanna get along

From the tower to the shores of U.K
We give a fuck what you think, we all believe in one thing
That if you’re doing something make it big, let it bang, shout it loud
Set it up, shut it down, just be sure to make us proud
I’ve been honest my whole life but I’ve been lied to
They said I’ll make it when pigs fly, Swine Flu
That tequila I been pouring in my pain’s got me borderline insane
I’m like odelay, you must be tripping if you thinking that I let it go
The gift is in my blood and my verses often set in stone
Getting to know, get with the times
Get in the zone, give it a chance
Give it a go, say what you want
You’re looking for trouble you’re looking for Omes

[Hook x4]
