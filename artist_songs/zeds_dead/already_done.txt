No spud, no head nod
No hug, just get lost
No love, just headshots
Suck your mum without the Xbox
Screw up in the same community
But me and dem bwoy don't communicate
Dem bwoy think they can move to me
But how much guns can they acculumate?
Fuck you, fuck them, fuck everyone
Many death threats but death never comes
That bwoy said that he's got a new ting
But he ain't gonna use that weapon once
My man said that he's gonna do this
My man said that he's gonna do that
Whatever that bwoy said he's gonna do
I bet they're things I've already done

Already done, already done
Already done
Already done, already done
Already done
Already done, already done
Already done
Already done, already done
Already done

Fuck you, fuck them, fuck everyone
Fuck you
Already done
I bet they're things I've already done

'Llow that
Man shout, I don't shout back
There's cameras in here
But there ain't none around back
25 to life
See that route? I don't wanna go down that
Way too smart, nah, fam
You've seen the movie, now hear the soundtrack
Creep on man like a ninja
Heat pon man but it's winter
Squeeze on man through the window
Beats on hand like a finger
Man know they be dead
Now man know you're a [?], you know how it gets
Surprise
But it's G, famalam, not Kinder

Already done, already done
Already done
Already done, already done
Already done
Already done, already done
Already done
Already done, already done
Already done

Creep on man like a ninja
Man like a ninja
Surprise
But it's winter
Man like a ninja

Already done, already done
Already done
Already done, already done
Already done, done, done
