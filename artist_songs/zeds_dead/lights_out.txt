You know the night is young, I'm trying to have some fun,
And you're the only one, one, I want.
We're going to leave this city, we'll drive and drive for miles,
No time to think about it, lets run away, lets run.

Ohhh, ohh...

This city has my heart, but now were miles apart,
We'll make the brand new start, start, start.
Let's find a new beginning, No time to turn back now,
This road is never ending, we'll find a way somehow.

Lights out, lights out..
