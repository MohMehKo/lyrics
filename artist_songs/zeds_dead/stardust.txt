These days burn fast
Got to make a good thing last
But it's hard when you feel alone
And you came and you let me go
From the first sign
I belonged to your song
But your sound is getting cold
And you came and you left me

I keep havin' these... stardust memories
Thinkin' about the way it used to be
And you came and you let me go
You keep havin' those... stardust memories
Talkin' about the love you took from me
And you came and you let me

I keep havin' these
Stardust, stardust
Stardust, stardust
I keep havin' these
Stardust, stardust
Stardust, stardust

Stardust memories
Thinkin' about the way it used to be
You keep havin' those... stardust memories
Talkin' about the love you took from me

Cover up the bad parts that you see
Coverin' up, second guessin' all your confidence in me
I've been overthinkin' now everything that you say
Cruisin' on lately, knockin' me so far down here every day
Listen to me cry alone, I need to pray
It's amazin' how you warn
I couldn't let it go when you slipped out of my room
It's everything you do, it makes melodies
It's everything you do, makes memories

Stardust memories
Thinkin' about the way it used to be
You keep havin' those... stardust memories
Talkin' about the love you took from me

Stardust
Stardust, stardust
Stardust
I keep havin' these
Stardust
Stardust, stardust

These things don't last
Even when the hard times pass
You present me with solid gold
When you love what is not your soul
From the first night
I was wrong, I belonged to a song that's getting old
But you came and you left me

I keep havin' these... stardust memories
Thinkin' about the way it used to be
And you came and you let me go
You keep havin' those... stardust memories
Talkin' about the love you took from me
And you came and you let me

I keep havin' these
Stardust, stardust
Stardust, stardust
I keep havin' these
Stardust, stardust
Stardust

Stardust memories
Thinkin' about the way it used to be
Stardust, stardust
Stardust memories
Talkin' about the love you took from me

Stardust
Stardust, stardust
Stardust
I keep havin' these
Stardust
Stardust, stardust
