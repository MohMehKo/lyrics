I met a guy with a loaded gun.
Hands up I got shaken right again.
Trigger finger you are fucked.
You go off in every direction.

Do let conscience divide us.
Get ready and, and fire.
We face our feelings, high race babe.

Head to head.
Neck and neck.

We face our feelings, high race babe.
Head to head, neck and neck.

Head to head, neck and neck.

Do it up just to come on down.
I live for a little, cant say im no fun.
And then I follow one by one.
So whats the senses.
Mounts on the fences.

Dont mess with my desire.
Get ready and, and fire.
Oh the face our feelings high race baby we go.
Head to head, neck and neck.

Neck and neck
We face out feelings high race babe,
Head to head
Neck and neck

Head to head
Neck and neck
