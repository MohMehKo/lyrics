Scared to live em my old ways
(My old ways)
Stuck on this one way train roll
(This one way train roll)
And I can't find the brakes
(And I can't find the brakes)
Taking me where I don't know
(Don't know)

'Cause I'm alone
So far from home
A stranger looking back
I don't know where to go

Till I see your light on
Till I see your light on
Till I see your light on

Till I see your light on
Till I see your light on

Follow you through the haze
(Follow you through the haze)
Pebbles tap on your window
Feel the cold on my face
(On my face)
I don't wanna hear you say no

'Cause I'm alone
So far from home
A stranger looking back
I don't know where to go

Till I see your light on
Till I see your light on
Till I see your light on

Till I see your light on
Till I see your light on
