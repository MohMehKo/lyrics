Would things be different,
If I could just find you?
Could you remember,
If I just remind you?
We could start over
And just tell the time to (tell the time to)

Slow down, slow down
Slow down, slow down
Slow down, slow down

This room is cloudy
Feels like my mind
Nowhere to go
'Cause you're so hard to find
But worth the fight
Or should we just let it go?

I know you'd kill
For one last taste
I can't be found
Then what are you doing?
We had no clue
But now I know

Slow down, slow down
Slow down, slow down

Would things be different,
If I could just find you?
Could you remember,
If I just remind you?
We could start over,
And just tell the time to (tell the time to)

I know you'd kill
For one last taste,
I can't be found,
Then what are you doing?
We had no clue
But now I know

Slow down, slow down
Slow down, slow down

Far away, you're never near
Where'd you go, 'cause I'm right here

Would things be different,
If I could just find you?
If I could just find you
If I could just find you
Could you remember,
If I just remind you?

(Tell the time to)

Slow down, slow down
Slow down, slow down

(Tell the time to)

Slow down, slow down
Slow down, slow down
