I'm glad I found you
Like hanging 'round you
You're the one
(one) [3x]

[Omar Linx:]
Yeah, yeah, if I remember right, you were dead wrong
We should start again, from where we left off
But I had done worse, hope you﻿ forgive me for it
'Til then my heart is yours, as long as you kill me for it
She said she want a man, told her there ain’t a chance
I know she got a plan, told you the girl is bad
And we were young and dumb so I should hold my tongue
But even then I knew it (you're the one)
And every day is like a vacay, read it like a book
I can tell we on the same page, just to gain my heart
Still would never be a safe place, falling from the sky, mayday mayday
Uh, and she feel me, like to be here
Smiling with those eyes she could never keep a secret
You could say I'm wrong but she's still my only weakness
I offered her my heart but she told me I could keep it (keep it [?x])

[Omar Linx:]
Uh, hold me back from what I'm 'bout to do
People do the darnedest things just to know the truth
What hurts you hurts me so we O for two
I skimmed through all my thoughts, there was only you
I'm still amazed how we wind up on this page
How we playin' out this game that I thought we'd never play
When I offered you the world and you swore you'd never change
But it's never been the same since that day you went away, like...
Damn

You're the one
I've waited for
Let's have some fun
(one) [2x]

[Omar Linx:]
What's wrong with you?
You can forget everything I promised you
I'll bury you alive and get back to what I ought to do
I hope it haunts your dreams, I hope you don't forget it
I hope it takes a little more once you reach the limit
And once the poison gets to seeping in your veins
And you feel it when you're sober and there's nothing for the pain
When you're lost up in the crowd, and you see me on the stage
Oh you would love to bring me down, I could hear what you would say
But there's you
And you tell me that we'll cope
I just gotta let it heal and we're sinking but together we can float
But you're mad, I can see it in your eyes
You're as crazy as they come
You're the devil in disguise and I know it's all a lie
I'll never let it go
I'll trade it in my hand but I'll never let 'em know
I play a different game, aces in my sleeve
I ain't got no time to waste, I'm impatient as can be
I'm just trying to set it free
Do it on my own
Key in the ignition I don't plan on going home
For every night I roam, I'll put it in a song
I guess I said it all
Farewell, so long
