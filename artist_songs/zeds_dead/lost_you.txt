I get to thinking that night, that I should call you
I like to think about the first time that I saw you
Thinking about you as if I lost you

I get to thinking that night, that I should call you
I like to think about the first time that I saw you
Thinking about you as if I lost you

It's the sickest little feeling I've got, won't leave me alone
When you can get your hands out
And you want every little chance that I got
I'll give it away for free

It's the sickest little feeling I've got, won't leave me alone
When you can get your hands out
And you want every little chance that I got
I'll give it away for free

Without your love
Without your touch
This world for me is never gonna be enough

Without your love
Without your touch
This world for me is never gonna be enough

Thinking about you as if I lost you

Without your love
Without your touch
This world for me is never gonna be enough

Without your love
Without your touch
This world for me is never gonna be enough
