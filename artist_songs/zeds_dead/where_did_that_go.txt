Not gonna waste time
Wondering what you need from me
Told you I made up my mind
It's my choice to make
Not gonna lose my mind
Wondering if you care for me
Holding me back with your eyes
But now it's strange to me

Thought there was a time you understood
Saw me in a different light
Saw me in the way I hoped you would
Had faith in me
Thought that when you saw my innocence
Taught me how to find my way
Told me that I could be anyone
Believed in me

Where did that go?
I'm not begging for your love no more
Where did that, where did that go?
I'm not begging for your love no more
Until you're missing me, missing me
Until you're missing me, missing me

Where did that go?
I'm not begging for your love no more
Where did that, where did that go?
I'm not begging for your love no more
(Until you're missing me, missing me)

Thought that when you saw my innocence
Taught me how to find my way
Told me that I could be anyone
Believed in me

Where did that go?
I'm not begging for your love no more
Where did that, where did that go?
I'm not begging for your love no more
Until you're missing me, missing me
Until you're missing me, missing me
