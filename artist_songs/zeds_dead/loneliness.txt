Even with them walls that they put 'round you
Imma be your touch
Even if our laws never look the same
I will move myself to your heart again
I will give my all if you move for me, even for your touch
Give my life and call, never let me be
Even when I'm lost in this moment

Even if the end is soon to come
I won't be the last flare from the sun
You would be the last breath in my lungs
'Cause loneliness is a criii--iiime
'Cause loneliness is a criii--iiii--oooohhhh

Loneliness is a

Loneliness is a lie
Loneliness is a lie

Don't go solo
Tell 'em that your all mine
Don't let this go
Tell 'em when it's o-o-o-over

Even if the end is coming on
I won't be the last flare from the sun
You would be the last breath in my lungs
'Cause loneliness is a

Loneliness is a
Loneliness is a lie

Loneliness is a

Even if the end is soon to come

Cause loneliness is a criii-iiimmeoohhhh

Loneliness is a
Loneliness is a lie

Don't let up, just go-go-gooo
Goooo -gooo -- gooo -- gooooo -- gooo
Don't let up, just go, tell 'em that its oo-ooo--ooover

Even if the end is coming on
I won't be the last flare from the sun
You would be the last breath in my lungs

Loneliness is a
Loneliness is a lie
Loneliness is a lie
