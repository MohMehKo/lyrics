Life goes free, wanna burning old trees to lighten
For you to scream it oh calm me down
I've been spending all my nights with the demons lately
They got me hell in your name calling out

I'm playing it slow, I'll play it sweet
I'm pulling you close under my feet
Ooh

Now your heart is my symphony
Now your heart is my symphony
I'm pulling it high to kick it down

How does it feel oh
How does it feel oh

Now your heart is my symphony
Now your heart is my symphony

How does it feel oh

I'm playing it slow
I'm playing it slow I'm pulling you close
Pulling you close
Ooh

My symphony

I'm turning you down
I'm playing too loud
And now its my turn
I'm playing it slow

I'm playing it slow
I'm playing it slow I'm pulling you close
Pulling you close
Ohh

Now your heart is my symphony

I got you standing on an ice cold bath in brighton
And need to take it home saw you work
Through the holes of your heart I'm not forgetting
And through the holes of your heart seek it not

I'm playing it slow I'll play it sweet
I'm pulling you close under my feet
Ooh

Now your heart is my symphony
Now your heart is my symphony
I'm pulling it high to kick it down

How does it feel oh
How does it feel oh

Now your heart is my symphony
Now your heart is my symphony

How does it feel oh

Now your heart is my symphony
