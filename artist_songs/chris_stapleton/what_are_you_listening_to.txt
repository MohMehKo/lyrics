I put that record on
Girl you know what song
And I let it play again and again
You're in every line
Takes me back in time
Yeah tonight I'm wondering

What are you listening to
Is it a cover band in some college town bar
Where it's na-na-na's and air guitars
Or is it something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still fall and hearts still breakin'
Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song about someone new
What are you listening to

I like to believe
That you're just like me
Trying to figure out how a good thing goes bad
I don't know
I can't let it go
Yeah it's about to drive me mad

What are you listening to
Is it a cover band in some college town bar
Where it's na-na-na's and air guitars
Is it something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still fall and hearts still breakin'
Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song about someone new
What are you listening to

Is it a feel good song get you driving too fast
The one that gets you moving on pass to pass
Or the kind you can't help singing along
singing woh-oh-oh-oh-ohhh
Is it headphones on a downtown train
Or a window seat on an outbound plane
Is it LA sunny and Memphis blue
I wish I knew I wish I knew

What are you listening to
Is it a cover band in some college town bar
Where it's na-na-na's and air guitars
And is it something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still fall and hearts still breakin'
Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song about someone new
What are you listening to

I put that record on - girl you know what song
And I let it play again and again
