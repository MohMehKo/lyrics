Put me on a chain
You put me in a box
You put me in a cage
And you start throwin' rocks

I offer up my heart
I offer up my soul
You wanted me to dance
I just wanna rock n roll

I don't know what I'm 'sposed to say sometimes
Where to draw that line
You oughta know
Nobody cares if the words don't rhyme
If you say the right ones

I waited in the rain
Pulled out all the stops
Walked out on the stage
And I played until we dropped
I tore the place apart
Let 'em all alone
I wanna take a chance, 
You wanna take it slow

I don't know what I'm 'sposed to say sometimes
Where to draw that line
You oughta know
Nobody cares if the words don't rhyme
If you say the right ones

I'm downtown
With a down crowd
Drinkin' my best not to think about you
Just a fool's hope at the end of my rope
Sitting at the bar, praying for a miracle

I don't know what I'm 'sposed to say sometime
Where to draw that line
You oughta know
Nobody cares if the words don't rhyme
If you say the right ones

I don't know what I'm 'sposed to say sometime
Where to draw that line
You oughta know
Nobody cares if the words don't rhyme
If you say the right ones
