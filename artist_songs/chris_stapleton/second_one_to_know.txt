Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Wanna leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know

Hold on my right hand
Sweat of the Promised Land
Rather die before I treat you bad
All I ask from you
Is to treat me the same way, too
Cause I don't want to lose this thing we have

Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Wanna leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know

First you stole my heart
That was the easy part
Don't ever tell me that crime don't pay
Now that's in your hand
Want you to understand
I would've given it to you anyway

Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Wanna leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know
