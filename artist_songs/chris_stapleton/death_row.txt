Well up here's the window sitting way up high
I can't look up enough to see the sky
There ain't no good light here below
Death Row
Death Row

Don't want no preacher man to come around
I don't need him to lay my burden down
Already told Jesus everything I know
Death Row
Death Row

When it's time for my last request
Tell my mama that I did my best
Tell my baby that I love her so
Death Row
Death Row
Death Row
Death Row

Got a calendar up on my wall
Marking days till I get the call
Till it's time for me to go
Death Row
Death Row
