Wish I could come home from workin'
And not have her checking my breath
I'm tired of her turning her questions
Into the Gettysburg Address

There's no reason why she shouldn't trust me
The fact that she don't makes me mad
Can't count all the times that I've begged her
Honey, just let my past be the past

I used to drink like a fish and run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People called me the Picasso of painting the town
I've finally grown up
I've finally changed
And that someone I was
Is somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around
You know I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down

Gave up on bringing her flowers
That just kept making things worse
I ain't been guilty of nothing
But being the man she deserves

I used to drink like a fish and run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People called me the Picasso of painting the town
I've finally grown up
I've finally changed
And that someone I was
Is somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around
You know I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down

I used to cuss like a sailor and howl at the moon
I woke up some mornings with I-don't-know-who
But I never dreamed back then I'd have to pay for it now
You know, I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down
Yeah, I'd hate to die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down
