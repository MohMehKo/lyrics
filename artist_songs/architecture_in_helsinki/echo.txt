Finally, let's go
To fault without your echo
Bouncing off the mountains like walls
Will crash without a cause

Have faith in me
Don't ask me why
Unrest in me
Don't pass me by

Echo echo
Echo echo echo
Echo echo echo
Echo echo echo

Find the darkness in your memory
I talk to them
Let me drift towards what you're thinking
I'll meet you then

Find the darkness in your memory
I talk to them
Let me drift towards what you're thinking
I'll meet you then

Have faith in me
Don't ask me why
Unrest in me
Don't pass me by

Echo echo echo
Echo echo echo
