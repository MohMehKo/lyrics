My bride and groom
spent the lonely season
figuring life out
so imagine the change
when the smoke it filled the air yeah
and when the north reflected southern lights
in the eyes of the deep where red turned white
you got the wrong attitude. to be lude
to stop and stare
You got me crawling through hoops on your roof
to a death song
and darling you forgot to tell me
i was gonna grow my hair wrong
and when the north reflected southern lights
in the eyes of the deep where red turned white
you got the wrong idea
if you're leaping off the edge of this world.
