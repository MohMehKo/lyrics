Night traffic in my van 
I drove solo baby 
Before you came to life 
I tried sleeping by the side of the road 

And I'm hardly a cave man 
Do we belong here? 
Can you feel your mind expand? 
Are you fooling 'round with me? 

I know deep down 
There is no turning back 
In the deep down 
Our lives are burning 

Moving faster waiting for somebody that's slow 
And I'm not talking backwards 
Speaking in reverse 
Cuz you know where that is 
With a distant stare 
And out of deep despair 
So are you fooling 'round with me? 

Now we're deep down 
There is no turning back 
In the deep down 
Our lives are burning 

Once upon a time 
Did it all in faith 
You were looking for somewhere 
To let the fire remain 
That was the past 
And reverse was our future 
Physical attraction while a moment bends 
Doesn't matter how we get there 
It was made to end 
And it ends just like it starts 
In this town 

I know deep down 
There is no turning back 
In the deep down 
Our lives are burning 

I know deep down 
There is no turning back 
In the deep down 
Our lives are burning
