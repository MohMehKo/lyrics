I've got problems,
I'm gonna use them.
I'm gonna keep them from you 'til you cry.

I've got machine guns,
I never shoot them,
I only borrowed them in case we die.

Late nights, play fights,
I'm freezing and you're leaving me here.
Blue and red up I'm fed, you're upset almost dead, tongue twisted.

35 nightmares and 94 days since I got near you and your anxious ways,
Hey darling, let's steal it,
I'm certain you're sure, 
Spell it to me love.

And as we planned there's fireworks, stage right,
They're swallowing the brains of all in sight,
It's 1am, that's the evening your time,
We're counting sheep,
Sell it to me, love.

Leave it while it still smolders,
So I'll have to say I told you, 

I carved our names in a tree there,
I meant the letters to be bolder, bolder,
Around the angles there's a race,
Where silver never gets golder,
And baby when we get older,
We don't have to get colder
