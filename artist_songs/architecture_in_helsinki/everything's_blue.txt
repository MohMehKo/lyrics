Ok...

You've been singing, negatively miss
Down in the bedroom minding my business
He hand balls like and honest kid
If freedom was a curse then we'd be trough with this

Flaunt your life don't keep it a secret
Three shot line don't jump in a deep pit
I don't do stars and you never did
The sky is caving in and your way cool with it

Now everything's blue
Only ever see the world in black and white
The colour we choose
In the morning is the colour of the night

of the night

Get your body walk at the same time
Eighteen O', I'm crossing the day line
From a time like now to a time like years
Remember where we are, under the new you tears

He's been singing, negatively miss
UFO I don't want to miss this
I don't leave stars and you never did
The sky is caving in and your way cool with it

Now everything's blue
Only ever see the world in black and white
The colour we choose
In the morning is the colour of the night

If dreams where trouble
I'd be rubbing shoulders with thieves tonight
And you can feed it baby, now my mind is blown
I found a universe to call my own

Now everything's blue
Only ever see the world in black and white
The colour we choose
In the morning is the colour of the night

of the night

I don't want to miss this
Don't want to miss this
You don't want to miss this

I don't want to miss this
Don't want to miss this
You don't want to miss this
