You won't count to seven 
It's usually 'til ten 
To hell with Sydney girls 
You're much better than them 

On my mattress I've been drawing a line 
Where I'll shut my eyes and where you should lie 
You should lie 
If you should lie 
I'll be a lighter of fires 
You be the fighter of fires 
I'll be the lighter of fires 
You be the fighter of fires 

Should I choose to stay here now all depends 
On buildings, buses, streets, trees, rain and friends 

On my mattress I've been drawing a line 
Where I'll shut my eyes and where you should lie 
You should lie 
If you should lie 
I'll be a lighter of fires 
You'll be a fighter of fires 
I'll be a lighter of fires 
You be a fighter of fires
