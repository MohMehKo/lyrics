Two time

Hush now baby
Have you heard?
I'll come second and you my third
I'm done running and you can't swim
Guess I just want to get a hold of him

Hush now baby
Don't you fight
Struck down hiding baby from the light
Two time loving you know I win
Guess I just want to get a hold of him
I just want to get a hold of him, ah

Two, two time loving
How does it feel to be wrapped around my finger?
Two, two time loving
I want you
I need a revelation

I need a revelation
(Hush)

(Ah, ah ooh)
(Ah, ah ooh)

Ah, I just want to get a hold of him
(Ah, ah ooh)
Ah, I just want to get a hold of him
