Hey you, where's your blood?
Where are your bones?
How come you're invisible?

I'm fading through a love and
I need you to hold,
I want you to be physical.

Tick tick [x2]
With the clock in my hand,
Back to the time in your bed,
You were my my original.

A player drew a line in the sand,
On that line in the sand,
Is where I want you to be my man.

When I caught ya walking on water.
When I caught ya walking on water.

Hey you, I'm all out of luck,
So let the dreaming get tough
And we can be invisible.
I'm waiting on the side of the road
It's to know where we know
I needed to be spiritual.

Tick tick [x2]
With the clock in my hand.
Back to the time in your bed,
You were my my original.

A player drew a line in the sand,
On that line in the sand,
Is where I want you to be my man.

When I caught ya walking on water.
When I caught ya walking on water.

Now it's happening in the past.
Through the glass in a distant way, I caught a miracle yesterday.

When I caught ya walking on water.
When I caught ya walking on water.
