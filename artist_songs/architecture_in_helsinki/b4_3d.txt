When I found out that each and every one of you were dead
Wrote a letter to the universe instead
She said I can put your mind at ease
I've got a planet on the line
La la la la la la love to be a man
Paintin' pictures to discover foreign lands
You put the ache into make believe
Out of sight is out of mind
Your famous last words, thought they'd never be erased
We were swimming on the night before three days
With the waves crashing down on me
We're not running outta time

Run for cover, hide beneath an avalanche
Change our name before we even took a chance
And when the sky's done cavin' in
Would you take me for a ride?
The night had a number, number 37 babe
Now we're dancin' to the music that we made
Your delay means eternal leave
Look forever to remind
That I-I-I-I-I-I wanna be your man
But you won't let me recover who you am
Set me free on a gentle breeze
Let me carry you beside
Wa-wa-wa-wa wanna comprehend
The reflection in the mirror in your hand
Or the weight of the seven seas
Really cut us down to size

Baby
Don't you know that it is understood
That if you take away the sunshine
Then you take away the starlight

Baby
Don't you know that it is understood
That if you take away the sunshine
Then you take away the starlight, ooh
[x4]

Baby, understood,
Sunshine, starlight
Baby, understood,
Sunshine
