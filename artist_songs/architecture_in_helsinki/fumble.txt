Found a flaw in the ending of a book that I've read twice, 
I set her straight, it's not based on your life. 

There's tension in this room, 
We'll have butterflies soon, 
Fumbling 'round in the dark with a flashlight. 

No need to be uncalm, 
We'll leave it by the phone, 
A message you can swallow, 
A letter to sign, 
No need to be alarmed, 
We'll leave this all alone, 
And all the guilt will follow you in a line. 

There's tension in this room,
