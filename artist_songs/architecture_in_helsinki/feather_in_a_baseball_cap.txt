I've never seen you frown this much
It's time that we 
left this haunted town
The spookiness of night surrounds us in trees
us on bikes on fountains
Never been alone as such
Your foots on the clutch
your hand's on my crutch 
slow down
and run in little circles til circles are 
black and on the ground.
and clever isn't where it's at
cos dumb is back
heads are holes and clouds

And I've never seen you frown this much
it's time that we got this flaunting down
a feather in a baseball cap
you dance all wack
weakened knees call

And I've never seen you frown this much
It's time that we rocked three daunting nouns
It's better not to holla back
'Cause life long cracks
speak through these walls
