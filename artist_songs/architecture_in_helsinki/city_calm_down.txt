Drinking stolen gin from the rich people's bar next door and awkwardly 
I'm leaning on the shoulder of the cousin who you choose to ignore 

and she says won't you calm down 
city city won't you calm down 
we're never gonna get to the bottom while there's traffic around 

Passed a little lonely cleanse 
If we play our cards right we can be more than friends still 

Oh so s-u-d-d-e-nly so suddenly 
ways of calculating, ways of catapulting you and me 
out of this town 
city city won't you calm down 
they'll never know we're in here if we don't make a sound 
Faster we'll divide all the sense 
into tiny parcels are you hoping it's tense, girl?
