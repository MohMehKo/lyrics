Ooh, oh

And as I rose from the rubble
The way you pointed at me
I wasn't looking for trouble
Hey, hey, I like what I see

Say if my eyes are mistaken
Look at the long lost land
If I could be any further
I might be stealing your hand

I'm in denial and you're no fun
I'm in denial and you're no fun
I'm in denial and you're no fun

I'm in denial and we are done
Batting the style of the lonely one
Takin' the hit for your chosen son
Uh, uh, son, uh, uh, son, uh, uh

Fulfill the heats of another
Even though we were wrong
I can't compete with your lover
While you've ruled all along

I'm in denial and you're no fun
I'm in denial and you're no fun
I'm in denial and you're no fun

I'm in denial and we are done
Batting the style of the lonely one
Takin' the hit for your chosen son
Uh, uh, son, uh, uh, son, uh, uh

Make it happen, make it happen
Make it happen, let it happen
Let it happen, make it happen

Let it happen, make it happen
Make it happen, let it happen
Let it happen, make it happen

I'm in denial and you're no fun
I'm in denial and you're no fun
I'm in denial and you're no fun

I'm in denial and we are done
Batting the style of the lonely one
Takin' the hit for your chosen son
Uh, uh, son, uh, uh, son, uh, uh
