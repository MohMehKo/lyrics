This song you played me
Was never meant to save me
From all the ghosts inside my head
I keep it open
We walked the path you've chosen
I might be broke, but I've got fire
Boom
(make me better)
Hold me forever
(you make me better)
You make me better
You make me better
Boom
(make me better)
Hold me forever
(you make me better)
We tried to steal it
I might deny I feel it
You knock on wood a hundred times
Lemme tell you know
I get lonely pretty vacant
I go nowhere dedicatin'
That's what happens
Till you come back home

I get lonely pretty vacant
I go nowhere dedicatin'
That's what happens
Till you come back home
Boom
(make me better)
Hold me forever
(you make me better)
You make me better
You make me better

Boom
(make me better)
Hold me forever
(you make me better)
You make me better

Boom
(make me better)
Hold me forever
(you make me better)
You make me better
You make me better

Boom
(make me better)
Hold me forever
(you make me better)
You make me better
How'd this get impossible
Started out incredible
Ohhh
Now you're just a friend of mine
Lookin' for an alibi
Ohhh
How'd this get impossible
Started out incredible
Ohhh Ohhh
Now you're just a friend of mine
Lookin' for an alibi

Boom
Me
You make-make-make-make me
Boom
Me
Me
You make-make-make-make me
You make-make-make-make me
Boom
(make me better)
Hold me forever
(you make me better)
You make me better
You make me better
Boom
(make me better)
Hold me forever
(you make me better)
You make me better
Oh
Boom
(make me better)
Hold me forever
(you make me better)
You make me better
You make me better
Boom
(make me better)
Hold me forever
(you make me better)
You make me better
Boom
