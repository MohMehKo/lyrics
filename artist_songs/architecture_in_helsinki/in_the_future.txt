Are you ready?
Are we in the future?
Living in the future?
Are we in the future?
Living in the future?

By the time we be singing once upon it
Flew the coop, bought a ticket straight to the moon
It doesn't feel like gravity is wanted
Now it's easy to float like I've float with you

(The future, the future)

Your mamma said that I like imagination
Hey, I saw stars in your eyes before the man in the moon
Now we're floating in that inner stellar nation
I like to put you something perfect, fine and true

If we stumble in the dark, light up shows us who we are
Oh, the language that you speak to me
Into ano...

Are you ready?
Are we in the future?
Living in the future?
