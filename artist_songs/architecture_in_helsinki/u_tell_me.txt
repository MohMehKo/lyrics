Down in the catacombs underneath the place that we call home
Searching for confessions kind by cover we flown
Old enough to chase the lights
Don't forget the boys and think twice

When we link arms and necks with paradise

Tell me the dumbest do the talking
The voices of a thousand
You tell me
You tell me
You tell me

Chemical reaction in the tunnel of love can't be undone
Shock me, take the time move alone to fall and climb

Hot enough to start
Cuttin' me apart
You're poison, think twice
When we link arms and necks and make with paradise

Tell me the dumbest do the talking
The voices of a thousand
You tell me
You tell me
You tell me

Tell me the dumbest do the talking
The voices of a thousand
You tell me
You tell me
You tell me

Tell me why

When you giving up?
Let the dummies do their talking
To the voices of the light
The voices of a thousand

Every little thing
Let the dummies do their talking
Only you tell me
You tell me
