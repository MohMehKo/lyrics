Stuck at your front gate
With some pictures I just want to hand ya (pictures [x5])
Almost made the door knock twice
Broke down on your verandah

Turn the dry concrete, into wet concrete

I can't find you anywhere (find you [x5])
I can't find you anywhere (pictures [x5])
So I wrote you a letter in capital letters
Saying all that I care for, all that I care for is...

Where you've been hiding
Where you've been hiding

Which way the habits collect neatly
Upon your stairs
Which way we'll be end them both disceetly
Leaving 'em for dead

When I find [x5]...

Where you've been hiding
