Dream we're never alone
Dreamt of moving on
Dream the Northern Lights
Together how we brought them back to life

Feeling of the land
Fuck the cold again
Feel my frozen eyes
Together we can kiss the night goodbye

And it won't take long to see
By the time we wake you'll be waiting for me

He never loved yea like I love the way you do
I never loved yea, oh, I never loved yea
He never loved yea like I love the way you do
I was born to convince you

Shelter from the rain
Here she comes again
Summers lost at sea
I'm making up our history

Now we were always meant to be

He never loved yea like I love the way you do
I never loved yea, oh, I never loved yea
He never loved yea like I love the way you do
I was born to convince you

I never loved yea, oh, I never loved yea
I never loved yea, oh, I never loved yea

Oh, don't go
I'm missing it
I'm sick of him baby
Oh, don't go, don't go

Oh, don't go
I'm dying here
I'm begging you baby
Oh, don't go, don't go

I never loved yea, oh, I never loved yea

He never loved yea like I love the way you do
I never loved yea, oh, I never loved yea
He never loved yea like I love the way you do
I was born to convince you

I never loved yea, oh, I never loved yea
You
I never loved yea, oh, I never loved yea
You
