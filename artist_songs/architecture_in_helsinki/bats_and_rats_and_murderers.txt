By yourself
By the road
there's a message in a bottle
from the phone we left 
got drunk alone

and baby can we climb up
up a rock face by a waterfall
on a holiday that felt no hot damn night
in a blackend hole
where there's gnats and rats and murderers
and next-door neighbors you for kick and fight.
