(T-t-touch)
If one of these two walls could speak
I'd turn the lights down long enough to hit repeat
Right now my vision is gone and magic's to blame
It's silent down here, hey I want to get loud again
You'll hold the thunder while I bring the rain

I might be busy doing nothing but I've had my share
You've got a strange infatuation with the love that's in the air

Contact high
I'm done dreamin that we can fly
Am I guilty? Boy you decide
I've got nothing to hide

Four letter words won't hold any sway (uh uh)
And in a paradise that shakes the word romantic to the bone
Mystical forces are circling me, while perfect nostalgia is dating the enemy
Lost in the ether with no one to blame
It's silent down here, maybe I want to get loud again

Contact high
I'm done dreamin that we can fly
Am I guilty? Boy you decide
I've got nothing to hide

(When we touch I get a)
Contact high
I'm done leaving if we can try
Am I guilty? Boy you decide
I've got nothing to hide

I might be busy doing nothing but I've had my share
You've got a strange infatuation with the love that's in the air

Contact high
I'm done dreaming that we can fly
Am I guilty boy u decide
I've got nothing to hide
(When we touch I get a)
Contact high... contact high... contact high
