Life on the outside of a fantasy
The more I bleed, the longer we breathe
And I could have sworn my heart was broken since were having fun
Now you're the one, alone with me

And if you, keep talking crazy 'bout a promise land
I'll understand, and will you to lie
Hard to be stuck on this desert island
My head down in the sand, no complications

Come on lets kick the sun
We'll become one, as the temperature rises
I saw the future, don't know how it ends
It might depend, on whether we leave

And in the moment it was open, you've done jumped the gun
And sunk our dreams out here in the sea
And I said

Don't come unstuck on this desert island
Imagination ends
My hope is fading

From here to kingdom come
You are the one, I'm floating beside

Somewhere our love stands always
By the way, by the sign
We built Atlantis in the space of a day

Our new home, Our new home
Our new home, Our new home
Our new home, Our new home
Our new home, Our new home
Our new home, Our...

We built our own utopia baby
Our own utopia baby (our new home)

We built our own utopia baby
Our own utopia baby (our new home)
