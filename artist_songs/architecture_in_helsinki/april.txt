Done remembering
You're in a different place now
I used to tell the truth
Of how the memories going to get me down

See, you are my friends and family
You are my setting sun
I dwell eternal
But I got to give you up until the fall

My April, again
So when you coming back?

(Ooh, yeah)

Are you coming back?

(Ooh, yeah)

I remember you
You're like a private beach now
We talk apocalypse
We try to think of ways to slow this down, girl

Still come the way you see the world
It's incredible
April I just want you to know
I need you, yeah

(Are you coming back?)
(Ooh, yeah)

You are my April
(Ooh, yeah)
(Are you coming back?)

You are my April
Are you coming back, coming back
Are you coming back right home

Are you coming back, coming back
You are my April
Are you coming back, coming back
Are you coming back right home

Are you coming back, coming back
You are my April
