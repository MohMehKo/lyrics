(Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow
Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow
Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow
Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow)

Today we fell from disaster to disarray
It seemed the world would always evolve this way
Like we were never seventeen

(Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow
Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow
Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow
Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow)
Make some history before tomorrow

These never ending ways of pretending
They got me tripping
Before tomorrow

(Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow
Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow
Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow
Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow)
Make some history with me

There are time when a lot of people keep their problems alive
We'll be floating backwards into the sun

(Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow
Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow
Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow
Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow)
Make some history before tomorrow

These never ending ways of pretending
They got me tripping
Before tomorrow

(Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow
Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow
Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow
Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow)
Make some history before tomorrow
Make some history before tomorrow

(Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow
Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow
Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow
Before tomorrow, Before tomorrow)
Make some history with me
