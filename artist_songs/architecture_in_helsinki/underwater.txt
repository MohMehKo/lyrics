Look both ways when you leave the building
the wrath of millions of thieves lies disguised
while the children of makeshift hills
let the code of silence repeat 16 times
when we get delayed can we cast a line towards anyone dismayed
can we go it alone say say say
caught me listening to water dripping
from those old lips to a town where its dry
when you leave don't say
that anyone here will be thinking in modern ways
can we go it alone say say say
Look both ways when you leave the building
the wrath of millions of thieves lies disguised

Here underwater we're down. Here underwater way down.
