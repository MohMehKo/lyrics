I'll tell you anything but not the truth
My Mum thinks she's in love with you and I'm not
And just to be sure do you wanna ride
Let me tell you something about christmas time when it's hot

when were cornered
in a bid to scare
I kept you from my reaches
didn't mean to care
what we got
do you like it or not?

I'm changing all your pills to vitamins
You got me eating form your hands
girl we're locked
Round about 10 with a love tattoo
you left me in yr cell
the things you do
when you're rot

wa wa wa

when were cornered
in a bid to scare
I kept you from my reaches
didn't mean to care
what we got
do you like it or not?

I'll tell you anything but not the truth
My Mum thinks she's in love with you and I'm not
And just to be sure do you wanna ride
Let me tell you something about new york when it's hot

Enormously Low
No It's true
There's never been a knife that cuts me half as deep as you
and wide for you
despite the dreams that others grow
