We're in a restless way when the fireflies come 
And they light the light where there was none
I won't think about next week
I won't think until tomorrow
Just a sight for sore eyes
Disguised as a fly

And not a single soul in these woods
Ever saw a jaw drop as low as is mine at the moment
Imaginary Ordinary
It's you that I belong with
