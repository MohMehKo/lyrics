Dream a little crazy

Why won't everybody
Just dream a little crazy
It's about time that everybody
Dream a little crazy

Love is a car crash, I saw stars
Built a vision from behind these bars
They were fading out of sight
Till I shook defensive, free your mind

Why won't everybody
Dream a little crazy
It's about time that everybody
Dream a little crazy

Stuck in a rough patch, I saw stars
Built strong visions from behind these bars
They were fading out of sight
Till I shook defensive, free your mind

Why won't everybody
Dream a little crazy
It's about time that everybody
Dream a little crazy

Just imagine when you're on the run
Kinda tragic, almost fun
Whoever told you your life was a drag?
And so what?

Why won't everybody
Dream a little crazy
It's about time that everybody
Dream a little crazy

Why won't everybody
Dream a little crazy
It's about time that everybody
Dream a little crazy
