And he's  mean talking beanstalking icey man
My feet are walking over him
My sneakers in his hand
And with a picket for a knife
and a rocket to depart in
My life had barely started since you jumped all my heart
and now we're lazy
lazy oooo lazy
In a galaxy of stars with nothing in the middle
'cept the planet that we own and its playing 2nd fiddle
And we're playing 2nd fiddle
and we're bogged down in a delta of glee
my mouth has sprung wide open
we got tickets they were free
and can you keep sleeping metaphysical girl
since the stars predicted something new would reconnect our worlds
and now we're lazy

can we grow out?

And he's  mean talking beanstalking icey man
My feet are walking over him
My sneakers in his hand
And with a picket for a knife
and a rocket to depart in
My life had barely started since you jumped all on my heart
