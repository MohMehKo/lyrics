When I talk in my sleep
I'll be begging for more
That's meant to sound sweet
Babe, you're meant to reward me
For working hard on my pleasantries
So when you've locked your door
You wanna got me a key

Across the river there's a smock
Swimming straight into your heart

And if I talk in my sleep
I ain't breakin' the law
I'm dreamin' to scream
Just like I told you before
When I was blue and green
And you are black and blue
We'll add a little brown
To break the silent in two

Across the river there's the squawk

Sleep talkin's almost letting go
I'm only parting with the magic
'Cause I need you to know
I'm getting tongue tied
I'm watching heads roll
Along with tightrope of tomorrow
With a reason to fall

Hold tight lady, take it slow
I'm only starting to be tragic
'Cause I need you to know
I'm getting tongue tied
I'm watching heads roll
Along with tightrope of tomorrow
With a reason to fall

Sleep talkin's almost letting go
I'm only parting with the magic
'Cause I need you to know
I'm getting tongue tied
I'm watching heads roll
Along with tightrope of tomorrow
With no reason to fall
