With an envelope, 
We'll enter buildings we might touch, 
I've got souvenirs but yesterday can't mean too much, 
Have we missed an opportunity? 

Whispers Chinese leaves a message, leaves a metaphor, 
For what once was gold and once was rich and now is poor, 
Have we missed an opportunity? 
And the trees lean to lend, 
Can I fold you in fourteen ways to depend not defend?
