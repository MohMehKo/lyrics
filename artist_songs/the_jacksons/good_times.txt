I think about the good times
We shared together
Whenever I think of you

Something goes through my mind
Through my mind

My heart starts churning
I wanna see you again

I think about the good times
Nothing but the good times
I think about the good times
We shared together

Oh, like holding hands
Remember how we made our plans
We used to dream on a star
How did we get like we are

I think about the good times
Nothing but the good times
I think about the good times
We shared together

It's funny things don't always
Go the way you want them to
Although we're not together
I treasure my experience with you

Oh, like exploring love
Moonlit sky above
Learning how to give
Learning how we should live

(Good times)
Oh, the good times baby
I think about it
Good times
We shared together
Oh, good times
Ain't nothing like the good times
The good times baby
I think about it
About the good times
We shared together
Together, together
I think about it

(Long as we live)
I remember, yes I remember
As long as we live
I'll think about
(The good times, baby)
Yes, the good times
The real good times

(Holding hands)
(Exploring love)
(Learning how to give)
(Learning how to live)
(Learning how to love)
(The good times, baby)

(Good times)
Good times
Yes, the good times
(Good times)
Good times
(The good times, baby)
