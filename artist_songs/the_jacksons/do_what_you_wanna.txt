[Chorus:]
Do what you wanna
And do it
Whenever I convince you
Stick to it

Keep on striving
Towards your goals
If it's right
Don't let it go
Live the life

You wanna live
Don't be phony
Just be real
People-be yourself
Don't be nobody -nobody else

[Chorus]

Don't let nobody
Fool you around
Tryin' to turn your life
Upside down

Just be strong in your field
And when you reach the top
Happily you will live
People-be yourself
Don't be nobody -nobody else

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

People-be yourself
Don't be nobody -nobody else
I'm telling you people-be yourself
Don't be nobody-nobody else

[Chorus]
