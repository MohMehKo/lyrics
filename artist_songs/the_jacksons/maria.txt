Pretty little se'orita
They come from miles around to see ya
Aah to get your love it's not easy
I hope I'll get a chance to meet you

You know I'm shakin'
Don't drive me crazy
If I cause trouble
Then there's one thing I know...
Hey, hey, hey

Maria my love you're just too much
I don't think they're tough enough
If I have to fight for you all night
Maria you're my love

Maria can I see yah
I just wanna love ya
The best man under pressure
Maria my love... uh

Darlin won't you take me serious
I take ya all around the world
We can have our own fiesta
Only if you say you're my girl

Oooh I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with her
I don't know , I don't wanna share her love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with her
And there's one thing I know...
Hey, hey, hey

Maria my love you're just too much
I don't think they're tough enough
If I have to fight for you all night
Maria you're my love

Maria can I see yah
I just wanna love ya
I just wanna hug ya
Maria my love... uh

Ooh I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with her
I don't know , I don't wanna share her love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'll let her know
Maria

Maria my love you're just too much
I don't think they're tough enough
If I have to fight for you all night
Maria you are my love

Maria my love you're just too much
I don't think they're tough enough
If I have to fight for you all night
Maria you are my love
