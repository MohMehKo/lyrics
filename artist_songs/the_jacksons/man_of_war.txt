[Chorus:]
Man of war
Don't go to war no more
Why don't you
Why don't you study peace
Man of war
Don't go to war no more
Study peace
Cause peace is what we need

You think your way
Is the best way for all
You don't know everything
You don't know it all
You got respect a man
For the way he feels
You can't make people do
Things against their will

[Chorus]

Just because your army
Gives you strength and might
Truth is gonna win...wrong will
Never conquer right
Every man has the right to
Think and be free
You're like a spoiled brat
You want everything you see

You think you bombs guns, and planes
Make you a big man
When you invade
Another man's land
Tryin' to make him be what
You want him be
Tryin' to make him do
What you want him to
Tryin' to make him say
What you want him to say
I know there's got to
Be a better way

You think your way
Is the best way for all
You don't know everything
You don't know it all
You got respect a man
For the way he feels
You can't make people do
Things against their will

[Chorus]
