I have a love
You gotta see
She's real tought
An' lookin' real mean

I turn her on
I have the key
The sound she makes
Excites me

The way she sits
The way she moves
Her body parts
Just makes you wanna groove

If you see her
Stop an' take a stare
If you look around
The lady won't be there

She's bad, bad
She's bad
She's bad, bad
She's bad, bad
She's bad

Can I take you for a ride
On my motorbike
Can I take you for a ride
On my motorbike

It's harley and she's
Bad say yeah
You will be surprised
Just how smooth she glides

She's harley and
She's bad say yeah
Can I take you for a ride
On my motorbike

It's harley and she's
Bad say yeah
You will be surprised
Just how smooth she glides

She's harley and
She's bad say yeah

Got on top of her
I cool her out
We cruise the town
Went all about

That's the way she lived
Told me she didn't know
Gonna take her to this place
Called 2300 Jackson Street

She's bad, bad
She's bad
She's bad, bad
She's bad, bad
She's bad

Can I take you for a ride
On my motorbike
It's harley and she's
Bad say yeah

You will be surprised
Just how smooth she glides
She's harley and
She's bad say yeah

Can I take you for a ride
On my motorbike
It's harley and she's
Bad say yeah

You will be surprised
Just how smooth she glides
She's harley and
She's bad say yeah
