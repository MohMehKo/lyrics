You use my love
To quench your desire
You play with me
You're playing with fire
I give my heart to take you higher
This is my only one desire
We can't get along
You won't come home

Yesterday I found you in his arms
Seducing him with all your charms
You know you really hurt me so
I need you
And I won't let go

Can't get away, babe
Can't get along, mama
Can't get away, babe
Though you hurt me so

Ooh ooh, babe

You got me cryin' in my sleep
I close my eyes
It's you I see
You might be somewhere else, I know
My heart says not to let you go
Oh, babe
My hurt is strong deep in my soul
It hurts my head down to my toes
I won't let go
You make me wild
You need me girl
You know I'll die

Can't get away, babe
Can't let you go, mama
I can't get away, babe
Though you hurt me so
Can't get away, babe
Can't let you go, mama
Can't get away
Though you hurt me so

Oh no, no, no, no, no
Lord help us
You hurt me so
You leave me
How can you leave me here
No place to go
Lord help us
You hurt me so
You left me here
And I can't
I can't get away, babe

Spoken:
You made it hurt
So deep in my soul

Can't get away, babe
Can't get away, babe
Can't let you go, mama
Though you hurt me so

Can't get away, babe
Can't let you go, mama
Can't get away, babe
Though you hurt me so

Oh no, no, no, no, no

I wonder
I wonder why

You got me cryin' in my sleep, babe
You that I see
Oh, oh, baby
