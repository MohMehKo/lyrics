Darling what are you doing
When the sun goes down
There are things we could do
Why don't you come around

There's a party tonight
That you're invited to
It's a party that's just for me and you
Heartbeat to heartbeat

So close together
Let the moment
Carry us away
Turn the lights tonight

The time is right
The perfect night
For a private affair
Close your eyes

Tune out the world outside
Hold me tight it's a private affair
Soft music playing on the stereo
And some rhythm

To take you where you want to go
I promise I won't answer
The telephone
You're with me darling

We're ggonna be all along
Heartbeat to heartbeat
So close together
Let the moment

Carry us away
Turn the lights tonight
The time is right
The perfect night

For a private affair
Close your eyes
Tune out the world outside
Hold me tight it's a private affair

Oh come to me
I can love you, you will see
I want to give you baby
All of need

It's a special occasion
A celebration
Let the moment carry us away
I wanna prove

I love the move in you
Perfect life, for a private affair
Close you eyess, darling, baby
Tune out the world outside

Hold me tight it's a private affair
We've got to world outside
We've got to the groove inside
We've got to move the head

'Cause it's a private affair
I don't wanna see you going away
My baby, yeah, hoo, hoo, private affair
You know love, I want you

Let's each other have a private affair, private affair
