I want the world
The whole wide world
To stop and listen to me

If we're going to stick together
We've got to be a family
This love
Love
Love

Have yourself a good, good time
But don't you know
It's getting late

Yeah, if this world
Is gonna be our home
We gotta make it strong
By living together

'Cause if this world
Is gonna be our home
We've got to make it strong
By living together

Have yourself a good, good time
But don't you know
It's getting late

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Give me peace
Give me sweet, sweet peace
So I can do my thing
I don't want no wars to hurt me
'Cause hurt is all it brings

Lets take the time
To check it on out
And learn what's right and wrong
Someday we can tell our children
That all the wars are gone

Love, love, love
Have yourself a good, good time
But don't you know
It's getting late

If this world
Is gonna be our home
(We gotta believe)
Gotta make it strong
By living together

If this world
Is gonna be our home
We gotta make it strong
By living together

Have yourself a good, good time
But don't you know
It's getting late

(Have yourself a good, good time)
(Have yourself a good, good time)

Gotta make it strong together
It's the only way to do it
Please, please, please
