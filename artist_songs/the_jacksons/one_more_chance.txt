Just remember everything I tell you.
Sorry for the pain and I have caused you.
You know it's true, I want to stay.
I know you tried to make it what it should have been.
You were there to help me when I couldn't have been.
I don't know what ever came over me.

Gimme that one more chance.
Remember all that we've planned.
Gimme that one more chance for me.

Gimme that one more chance.
Remember all that we've planned.
Gimme that one more chance for me.

I just want to do half of what you do.
And I know it seems so strange of me to say this.
If there is a hundred ways to say it, all in one it means don't go away.
Everybody's goin' around tellin' you lies.
They don't know how hard I've tried.
You know it takes the pressure for me to see.

Gimme that one more chance.
Remember all that we've planned.
Gimme one more chance for me.

Gimme that one more chance.
Remember all that we've planned.
Gimme that one more chance for me.

If you could read my mind how wonderful it would be.
Love is hard to find, and what it means to me is so divine.

Gimme that one more chance
Remember all that we've planned.
Gimme that one more chance for me.

Gimme that one more chance.
Remember all that we've planned.
Gimme that one more chance for me.

Gimme that one more chance.
I want to prove it
Remember all that we've planned
I know we can do this
Gimme that one more chance for me.

Gimme that one more chance.
Love's my playground
I realise I let you down
Gimme one more chance for me.

Say you love me.
Say you love me.
I want you to say it, say it,
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
I love you.
Please tell me you love me
