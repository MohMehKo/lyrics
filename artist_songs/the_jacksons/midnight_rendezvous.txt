Gettin' close to midnight
I feel the trouble in the air
Livin' here in the city life
So it seems they just don't care

She says groove all night
I said it's gotta be alright
She said take my advice
The night has just begun

Let's get down
Midnight rendezvous
Ah where people go
Can't help but get loose

Midnight rendezvous
This place uptown
Where they all get down
Wall to wall people jumpin'

A lot of babes are in this place
I don't care if she belongs to him
I'm gonna stare back in her face
She says groove all night

You said wanna start a fight
I said take my advice
And yeah the night has just begun
Let's get down

Midnight rendezvous
Ah where people go
Can't help but get loose
Midnight rendezvous

This place updown
Where they all get down
Midnight rendezvous
Ah where people go

Can't help but get loose
Ah no
Ah groove all night long
Groove on

All my baby, baby, baby
Dance with me 'til mornin'
Midnight rendezvous
