Yah tell me lies
It brings me down down
I sacrificed do all I can for you
Then you throw me away

It's hard to figure out
If you want me
If you need me
I just have to wait and see

Alright it's alright
Alright with me
There's nothing you can do
To turn and make me walk away

Alright it's alright
Alright with me
I don't care what people say
I'm gonna love you anyway

Must be love
You misused the person in me
(Yeah, you did)
Like a hand in glove
Always thought how we could be

I can't turn back the times
When you were all mine
Try to love you
Try to please you

I just have to wait and see
Alright it's alright
Alright with me
I don't care what peole say

I'm gonna love you any way
Alright it's alright
Alright with me
There's nothing you can do
To turn and make me walk away
