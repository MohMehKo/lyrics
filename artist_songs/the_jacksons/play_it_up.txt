You've been sitting here thinking
Wether or not
He's gonna be with you
Give it up babe

Not meant to be this time
If he's not gonna love ya
Then don't worry 'bout losin'
His love

You'll make it up baby
Don't let it get you down
I can show you what love is all about
You're such a treat so candy sweet

With one chance I'll love away
All your doubts
Won't you be mine
Let's have a good time

Play it up
Just play it on up
Play it up
Just play it on up

Play it on up baby
Don't let it get you down
Show expression in whatever
You do

Gain possession
Keep control of your mind
Wake up baby
Don't let it get you down

Cryin' just don't make sense
Another victim of his evil game
I'll treat you right baby
Girl you should be mine

I can show you what love is all about
You're such a treat so candy sweet
With one chance I'll love away
All your doubts
Won't you be mine

Let's have a good time
Play it up
Just play it on up
Play it up
Just play it on up
Don't let it get you down
