Baby, baby listen to me
There is something you have to see
We'll show you
What you got to do
You just follow our next move

(Keep on dancing)
Let me music take your mind
(Keep on dancing)
Have a real real good time
(Keep on dancing)
Why don't you
Get up on the floor
(Keep on dancing)
Till you can't dance no more

(Keep on dancing)
Keep on dancing
(Dancing)
Dancing, yeah
Get up on the floor

Dancing, girl, will make you happy
And happy is what you want to be
Dancing fast
Just spinning around
Dancing slow
When you get down

(Keep on dancing)
Let me music take your mind
(Keep on dancing)
And have a real real good time
(Keep on dancing)
Why don't you
Get up on the floor
(Keep on dancing)
Till you can't dance no more

(Keep on dancing)
Keep on dancing
(Dancing)
Dancing, yeah, yeah

(Music is a feeling)
(That you just can't resist)
(When you're dancing to the music)
Dancing to the music
(Time just don't exist)

Get on up
Get on up
(Keep on dancing)
Take the worries off your mind
(Keep on dancing)
Have a good, good, good time
(Keep on dancing)
'Cause there's nothing else to do
(Keep on dancing)
It makes you feel good too

(Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance)
(Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance)
