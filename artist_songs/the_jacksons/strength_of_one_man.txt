There's a system we all must follow
If we wanna get ahead
Some men are strong enough to make it
And others are just too afraid
But mama told me a story
And it keeps, keeps me alive
Said some are weak, the weak fall by the wayside
And all the strong the strong survive
Now you tell me...

How strong is the strength of a man
Can he stay on his road, and carry his load
Can he carry his load
Can he carry his load
Can he carry his load
Can he carry his load

We have picked people, and say they're on our side
And after they did everything they want (y'all)
They start to tell us lie, just lie after lie

But we can't blame our problems
On just that chose few
Caues if we wann solve then
It's up to me and up to you
Now you tell me...

How strong is the strength of a man
Can he stay on his road, and carry his load
Can he carry his load
Can he carry his load
Can he carry his load
Can he carry his load

Is he strong enough, because the road is tough
Strong enough, because the road is tough
Strong enough, because the road is tough
Strong enough, because the road is tough
Strong enough, because the road is tough
Strong enough, because the road is tough
Strong enough, because the road is tough
Strong enough, because the road is tough
Strong enough, because the road is tough
Strong enough, because the road is tough
Strong enough, because the road is tough
Strong enough, because the road is tough
Strong enough, because the road is tough
