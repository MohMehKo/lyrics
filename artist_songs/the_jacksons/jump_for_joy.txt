People have misunderstandings
Of what life is all about
They put values on the wrong things
And in happiness they lose out

Cause being happy's a feeling
It's all a frame of mind
And every moment you feel sad and blue
You could be having a real good time

Why don't you jump for joy and be happy
Why don't you jump for joy and be glad
If you just try it, you'll feel better
And have the best time you've ever had

There is no sense in worrying
Cause that won't solve a thing
Chances are whatever's worrying you
Is not as bad as it seems

Being down won't last forever
Cause nothing stays the same
You will will have a bright tomorrow
There's always sunshine after rain

Why don't you jump for joy and be happy
Why don't you jump for joy and be glad
If you just try it, you'll feel better
And have the best time you've ever had
