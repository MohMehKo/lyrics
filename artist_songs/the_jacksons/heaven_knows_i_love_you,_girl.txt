I've never felt this way before
Each day I love you more and more

People always stare at us
When we are together
We laugh and joke and
Have a ball
We're friends and that makes
It better
We respect each other too
I was very lucky the day
I found you

I've never felt this way before
Each day I love you more and more

I've found a little place for us
To go and be alone
Let's fix it up the way we want
And call it home sweet home
Our love is priceless
It's so rare...so good
We believe in the same things too
Oh I was so lucky the day
I laid my eyes on you

I've never felt this way before
Each day I love you more and more
