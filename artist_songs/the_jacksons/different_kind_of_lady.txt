If you want me
I'll be there in a flash
If you need me
Well that's different at last
Say it-no delay
Cause everything I do
Is always up to you
You got me saying'
Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo

I'm here to please you
In every way I can
To prove to you
That I'm your only man
Trying, no denying
Cause everything I do
Is always up to you
You got me sayin'
Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo

[Chorus:]
I searched this world
For a different kind of girl
I caught myself going girl shopping
No matter what I do
I keep running back to you
Saying you're all mine
Different kind of lady

The way I love you
In case you'd like to know
You're a lady
And that's a different show
You're meant for me
That makes you different, you see
Cause everything I do
Is always up to you

Cause you're a different kind of lady
Cause you're a different kind of lady
Cause you're a different kind of lady

[Chorus]

If you want me
I'll be there in a flash
If you need me
Well that's different at last

Cause you're a different kind of lady
Cause you're a different kind of lady

[Repeat and fade out]
