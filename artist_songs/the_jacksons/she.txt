I really need her
She
She
She
She

She loves
She
She
She

I have found a lady
That's so real to reality
She's the kind of lady
That's so fresh and dressed to the trip

Flowers, fancy car, diamonds and gold
She wears it well
She's the kind that's close to me
And flower can't you tell

She's mine
She's mine
And she's fine
And I know so deep in my heart

I really need her
And I know that
She - is the one I love
She - one I'm thinking of
She - that girl blows my mind
She - I know my girl is fine

Leather and lace and designer pantyhose
She looks so good to me
Bad from head to toe
Body so hot
Looks so good
She makes me sweat

I know I love that girl
I know I can't forget her
She's mine
She's mine
And she's fine
And I know so deep in my heart

I really need her
And I now that
She - is the one I love
She's - one I'm thinking of
She's - the lady of my dreams
She's - not the way it seems

She
She
She
She
And I know that
She
