I can't help the things I do
Tho' they might seem strange to you
Got my mind, just spinnin' round
Inside, outside, upside down
There's an art to all this madness
Tho' it seems insane to you

There's a rhyme to all the reason
In everything I do
Have you any imagination
Of what I'm goin' through
There's art to all this madness
I'm just crazy over you

People just can't understand
They don't think I'm a normal man
So tell me why they walk around
Using half of their brain
You tell me now who's insane
There's an art to all this madness
Tho' it seems insane to you

There's a rhyme to all the reason
In everything I do
Have you any imagination
Of what I'm goin' through
There's art to all this madness
I'm just crazy over you

Art of madness
Art of madness, ooh
Art of madness

I went to the doctor the other day
Just to make sure if I was ok
The diagnosis said I was totally insane
I found out the doctor used half of his brain
There's an art to all this madness
Tho' it seems insane to you

There's a rhyme to all the reason
In everything I do
Have you any imagination
Of what I'm goin' through
There's art to all this madness
I'm just crazy over you

Art of madness
Art of madness, ooh
Art of madness
