Live in sin
Ten years ago on this day
My heart was yearning
I promise I would never ever be returning
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning
As we walked to the room
There were faces starring
Glaring, tearing through me
Someone said welcome to your doom
Then they smiled with eyes
That looked as if they knew me
This is scarring me

We walked up the stairs
Still concealing gloom
There were two girls
(Sitting in my room)
She walked up to my face
Said this is the place
You said meet you right here at noon

This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So this is Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel

Hope is dead
She thought that I had cheated for another lover
I turn my back to see that I'm undercover
Now I can't convince this girl there ain't no other
Someone's evil to hurt my soul
Every smile's a trial thought
In beguile to hurt me
This is scaring me
Then the man next door had told
He's been here in tears for fifteen years
This is scaring me

We came to this place
Where the vicious dwelt
Found that wicked women
(Run this strange hotel)
There was Sefra and Sue
Every girl that I knew
And my baby said love is through

This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So evil
(Heartbreak Hotel)
This place is Heartbreak Hotel
Someone's stabbin' my heart
(Heartbreak Hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel
(Heartbreak Hotel)
Ten years ago today
(Heartbreak Hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel
(Heartbreak Hotel)

Someone's stabbin' my heart
(Heartbreak Hotel)
This is heartbreal hotel
(Heartbreak Hotel)
Ten years ago today
(Heartbreak Hotel)
Hurting my mind
(Heartbreak Hotel)
You break my baby's heart
(Heartbreak Hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel
(Heartbreak Hotel)
Just welcome to the scene
