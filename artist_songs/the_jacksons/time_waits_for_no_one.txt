Lonely
In my darkened room
Sad and weary
Persevering for love
Sad and weary
Persevering

And I hope that she is thinking
To come back to me
Is it possible she's thinking of me at all
Have I gone too far

If only I had shown her love
She'd be with me
Deep inside me
My love, my love
She'd be with me
Deep inside me

And I hope that she is thinking
To come back to me
And I pray that faith can bear
This suffering inside
'Til she arrives

And I hope that she is thinking
To come back to me
And I'm scared there's someone
Sleeping by her side
I can't hide all the pain deep inside
Is this love

Time waits for no one
Time waits for no one
Time waits for no one
Time waits for no one
Time waits for no one
Time waits for no one
(No one)
Time waits for no one
Time waits for no one
