You're such a mystery
It's never clear to me
You're always leaving me second guessing
All I wanna know is
Baby where you go
Where you been when you come up missing
Miss Disarray

You swim in the pouring rain
I'm holding on in vain
The more I try the more that I just feel so far away
Miss Disarray
Miss Disarray

It started carelessly
Leading you to me
Kisses sweet but complicated
A happy ending girl
I knew you'd never be
Burning bright but sadly faded

You swim in the pouring rain
I'm holding on in vain
The more I try the more that I just feel so far away
Miss Disarray
Miss Disarray

There's no pretending
That happy endings
Will ever see me through
So the story goes and I'm not over you

Kisses sweet but complicated
Burning bright but sadly faded

You swim in the pouring rain
I'm holding on in vain
The more I try the more that I just feel so far away
Miss Disarray
Miss Disarray
