I didn't ask for this,
I couldn't ask for that,
I wouldn't ask for any change in plans.
Am I ever right?
When you're such a brat,
I feel much better in your hands.

Try to take your word,
I want to take you down,
You never caught me lying.
I'm trying not to shout,
Wanna work it out,
I've been so long denying.

[CHORUS]
I'm a long time gone,
Keeping your secrets for too long,
Baby you ain't half of what you used to be.
In this dim October sky,
I've got no more tears left to cry,
And I'm finally learning,
You can't be too strong.

I'm a long time gone.

When you understand,
There's no one truth,
And we're three-thousand miles apart.
Try and act your age,
And you're a flaming youth,
You seek the end,
But never start.

If I'm a man,
Do I have the strengh,
To change what I'm becoming?
I've been such a fool,
Didn't want to lose,
It's been a long time coming.

[CHORUS]

I'm a long time gone,
I'm a long time gone.

[CHORUS]

I'm a long time gone,
I'm a long time gone,
I'm a long time gone,
I'm a long time gone.

I'm a long time gone,
I'm a long time gone,
I'm a long time gone,
I'm a long time gone.
