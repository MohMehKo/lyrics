Time,
Passes like a dream,
She suspends the worst of things,
Tomorrow let's see.
To hell with her,
It's not hers to forestall,
I've worked out paralysis,
Undermining it all.

Collapsing light,
The night moves close to me.

If you're gonna leave on your own,
And take the whole world down alone.

Life,
It's always just out of reach,
Was it there at my parents' house,
Or maybe just down that street?
But your mind,
However lacking it feels,
Still I'd trade you away today,
For some feeling that's real.

Collapsing night,
The light breaks close to me.

If you're gonna leave on your own,
Life is in your hands,
Yes, I understand,
It's up to you all alone.
If you're gonna leave on your own,
Jet black is the payback,
This fine sunrise.

When you're bored,
So sick of your song,
When whole worlds just disappear,
Swallowed up and gone.
When you're down,
Down how far can I go?
Raise the future in the wasted past,
Everything unknown.

Happiness,
Means nothing to me.

If you're gonna leave on your own,
Life is in your hands,
Yes, I understand,
It's much to take all alone.
I wish you wouldn't leave on your own,
Jet black is the payback,
Jet black is the payback,
This fine sunrise.
