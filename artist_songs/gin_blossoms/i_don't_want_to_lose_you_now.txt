I wasn't really leaving
I was just college gone
I thought that love could last
From September to May

Got back just in time
'Cause you were moving on
I thought that I could come and go
And you'd just wait

I don't wanna lose you now
I promise I'll make it better and I better
'Cause I've seen a world without you and I bet you
If there's a way I'll find a way some how
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now

I know I've got it coming so, baby, just let it out
'Cause you're worth the price that you're making me pay
Now I don't wanna wait another minute
This is my life and I wanna spend it with you
How about you? what you say?

I don't wanna lose you now
I promise I'll make it better and I better
'Cause I've seen a world without you and I bet you
If there's a way I'll find a way somehow
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now

I know we're good together
If everyone knows and everyone can see
What you do to me

I don't wanna lose you now
I promise I'll make it better and better
And better, yes, better

I don't wanna lose you now
I promise I'll make it better and I better
'Cause I've seen a world without you and I bet you
If there's a way I'll find a way somehow
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now

(I don't wanna lose you now)
I don't wanna lose you now
(I don't wanna lose you now)
I don't wanna lose you now
(I don't wanna lose you now)
I don't wanna lose you now
(I don't wanna lose you now)
