Well darlin' I don't know much
But I know I learned so much
My life depends on your touch
For my love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me it's soul deep
Too big to hide and it can't be denied
My love is a river running soul deep
I'd put myself to death for ya
Just to show I adore ya
Nothin' I wouldn't do for ya
Cause my love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me it's soul deep
Too big to hide and it can't be denied
My love is a river
All I ever really want to be
Depends on your love for me
Baby believe me
If you should leave me
I'd be nothing but an empty shell
And you know darn well I can tell though
And all I ever really want to be
Depends on your love for me
Baby believe me
If you should leave me
I'd be nothing but an empty shell
You know darn well I can tell though
Well I don't know much 
But I know I learned so much
My live depends on your touch
For my love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me it's soul deep
It's too big to hide and it can't be denied
My love is a river running soul deep
My love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me it's soul deep
It's too big to hide and it can't be denied
My love is a river running soul deep
