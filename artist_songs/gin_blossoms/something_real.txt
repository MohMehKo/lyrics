I don't know if it matters
But I'm sorry that we made such a mess
Out of Love
I don't understand the pressure
Could this day get any better?
A long way from hard times I Win you again
The dark roads and hard snows
How could I know?
We just make it all up as we go

[Chorus:]
So give me something real
That I can lay my head on 
No fairy tales or Dreams
I'm sick of make believing
I made a promise long ago
It all fell apart I don't wanna let go
C'mon give me something real

I don't know any better
But I know that I've made some mistakes with your love
i can't help but think
it matters
The illusion finally shatters

A long time gone now to win
you again time slows hearts
Froze how could I know?
I just make it all up as I go...

[Chorus:]
So give me something real
That I can lay my head on 
No fairy tales or Dreams
I'm sick of make believing
I made a promise long ago
It all fell apart I don't wanna let go
C'mon give me something real

I may or may not really know
It hurts to think it's worse to.

Speak don't let go
The words I seek won't let go
A promise lasts forever...

[Chorus:]
So give me something real
That I can lay my head on 
No fairy tales or Dreams
I'm sick of make believing
I made a promise long ago
It all fell apart I don't wanna let go
C'mon give me something real

So give me something real
That I can lay my head on 
No fairy tales or Dreams
it's over... I'm not what I had left behind
i might be wrong but I know I tried

C'mon give me something real
C'mon give me something real
C'mon give me something real
