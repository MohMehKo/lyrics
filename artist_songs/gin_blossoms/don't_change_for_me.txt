You know I can't pretend
It's not an accident
I have become somebody else
So much I want to say
You see me everyday
I wish that I could should it out

[CHORUS]
You gotta run
This world ain't standing still
Gotta believe
You can make it up that hill
You gotta know
You can have anything
You gotta be
The best that you can be
But don't change for me

Some things I try and hide
But you see through my disguise
When you are tearing down the walls
You're gonna figure out
I know without a doubt
These things don't matter much at all

You will be free

[CHORUS]
You gotta run
This world ain't standing still
Gotta believe
You can make it up that hill
You gotta know
You can have anything
You gotta be
The best that you can be
But don't change for me

Sorry is not a word
I want to use so easily
I need to know that life
Won't pass you by

[CHORUS]
You gotta run
This world ain't standing still
Gotta believe
You can make it up that hill
You gotta know
You can have anything
You gotta be
The best that you can be
But don't change for me
