It's been such a long time,
Since I've seen you around,
I ran into your brother,
Who said you were back in town.
It's just so funny,
To see you in this dive,
It must be so different,
When you're eight miles high.

[CHORUS]
Supergirl flying,
Through the atmosphere,
Touching down in Paris,
Soon be in Tangiers.
It's a superhero's welcome,
When you finally come back down,
But even when you land,
I bet your feet don't touch the ground.

Supergirl.

I heard about your father,
And it was sad to hear,
I would have made the service,
But I thought it might be weird,
My family sent some flowers,
He was such a kind old man,
That time he caught us kissing,
Behind the old bandstand.

[CHORUS]

Supergirl,
Supergirl.

Sometimes late at night,
When I am all alone,
I watch the airplane lights,
Make my way back home,
I wonder if you're flying,
Somewhere up in the clouds,
While the rest of us are stuck here, Down inside the crowd.

Are you ever lonely,
In some motel room,
Looking out the window,
At an ever-changing view?
Can you think as far back,
As when you and I were young?
If anyone would make it,
You're gonna be the one.

[CHORUS X2]

Supergirl,
Supergirl,
Supergirl,
Supergirl.

Supergirl,
Can you hear me calling?
Supergirl,
I don't think she can.
Supergirl,
Can you hear me calling?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
