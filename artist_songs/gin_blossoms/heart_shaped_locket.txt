She's got all the moves,
She's got nothing to prove,
She's so cold, so smooth,
Her needle fits the groove.

She's everything she forgot to be,
At twenty-three,
She's hot, she's cold,
She's just so clinically,
Cynically.

[CHORUS]
Who's the girl with a heart shaped locket?
Sole survivor of a post-teen scene,
Lights me up like a bottle-rocket,
Cleopatra meets Sandra Dee,
Yeah, that girl's gonna ruin me.

A plaid pleated skirt,
And a Carpenters t-shirt,
Couture, demure,
Not just another small-town flirt,

She's everything she forgot to be,
At twenty-three,
She's hot, she's cold,
She's just so clinically,
Cynically.

[CHORUS]

Who's the girl with a heart shaped locket?
Who's the girl with a heart shaped locket?
Who's the girl with a heart shaped locket?
Who's the girl with a heart shaped locket?

[CHORUS X2]

Who's the girl with the heart shaped locket...
