Here's a little something that I brought here for you
It ain't much but it might just do
Fairly serious could hardly say
That I couldn't give my heart away
I couldn't give my heart away

It's never enough to feel and say
Throw my promises away
Several things that I could do
But I couldn't give my heart to you
I couldn't give my heart to you

Smokes on the table the matches are lost
There's room in the back of the bar
Fairly serious could hardly say
That I couldn't give my heart away
I couldn't give my heart away

Smokes on the table the matches are lost
There's room in the back of the bar
Oh, it's not really serious but I should prove
That I don't mean what I might not do
Not that you wanted it anyway
But I couldn't give my heart away
I couldn't give my heart away
I couldn't give my heart away
