Say you better pack,
Better get your things together,
Don't know where to go,
Until you wind up there.
Better grab a coat,
You can never tell the weather,
Let's hope were gone forever.

[CHORUS:]
Someday soon,
Gonna sail the big blue ocean,
Gonna cause a big commotion.
Someday soon,
Keep it down below the radar,
See beyond the brightest big stars.

Mama said your life wouldn't be too easy,
That's about the only thing she said at all,
Still those words are all you're left to cling to,
They're all that seems to ring out true.

[CHORUS]

Someday soon,
Someday soon...

The towns pass by,
Like a car crash chase,
The nights blur into,
Another endless race.
Just slow it down,
Stop running from your ghosts,
Just slow it down,
Just slow it down.

Say you better pack,
Better get your things together,
Don't know where to go,
Until you wind up there.
Until you wind up there.

[CHORUS]

Someday soon,
Someday soon.
Someday soon,
Someday soon.
