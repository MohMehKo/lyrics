Can we take this hell away to soul
I figured all this time by now we'd grown
Can you wake up suddenly feeling pleased
Been walking all this time while down on your knees

Staring at the starlight
I can smell those brackish waters
I swear I've had this feeling here before
Come on hard at night I pine for you and no other
I promise I won't hurt you anymore

Poor us, frail as they come
And thinking all this time I'm right and I'm not
I cannot help myself and I know it's not your fault
I was certain then but now I don't know

Staring at the starlight
I can smell those brackish waters
I swear I've had this feeling here before
Come on hard at night I cry for you and all the others
I promise I won't hurt them anymore
(Hey!)

(I promise I won't hurt you anymore)
(I promise I won't hurt you anymore)
Staring at the starlight
(I promise I won't hurt you anymore)
I can smell those brackish waters
(I promise I won't hurt you anymore)
I swear I've had this feeling here before
Come on hard at night I cry for you and all the others
I promise I won't hurt them anymore

Staring at the starlight
I can smell those brackish waters
I swear I've had this feeling here before
(Before)
Come on hard at night I cry for you and no other
I promise I won't hurt you anymore
Well I promise I won't hurt you anymore
