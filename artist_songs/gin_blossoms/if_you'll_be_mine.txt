Someone hurt you bad 
When you were just a kid
And though it's been awhile 
You still feel the worst of it
No matter how hard you might try 
You just can't seem to let it go
So you hid your heart away 
That's a temporary fix
Then you built your tower high 
With your own hands brick by brick
Never ever holding out hope. 
There might be someone, somewhere, 
Baby let down your hair
I'll be yours if you'll be mine
Throw the rope and watch me climb 
Rung by rung into the sky

We wont fall cause we can fly
And I'll be yours if, you'll be mine
Don't be a victim of chance
We can still beat this old circumstance
In your heart you know it's true
There is so much more for you to do
I'll be yours if you'll be mine
Throw the rope and watch me climb 
Rung by rung into the sky
We wont fall cause we can fly
And I'll be yours if, you'll be mine
I'll be yours if, you'll be mine
