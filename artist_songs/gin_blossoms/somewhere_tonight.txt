I don't wanna say that I've loved you forever but I have
I don't wanna say that I'm missing you bad but I am
You could hurt me
And I could hurt you back
Somewhere tonight

We've got our stories and we've some secrets to keep
Seems on the surface that nothing's on purpose
But way down deep
Something tells me
We'll be losing sleep

[Chorus:]
Somewhere tonight
Let's start a fire and burn up all the lies
Somewhere tonight
Strewn in the ashes
No place left to hide
You act hurt and I'll act angry
And we'll both act surprised
Somewhere tonight
Somewhere tonight
Somewhere tonight
Somewhere tonight
Somewhere tonight

Let's hold the candle close and see which one of us gets burned
It's the only way I'm gonna learn
If you wanna play me
Go ahead and pay me

You could hurt me
And I could hurt you, too
But something tells me
I'll be there with you 
Yeah, I'll be there with you 

[Chorus]
