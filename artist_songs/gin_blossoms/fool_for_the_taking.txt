Tangled up and twisted,
And I don't know what to do.
I'm living with Marie Antoinette,
She's living with a fool.
Life with her majesty,
Has got one golden rule.
No matter what she will let me forget,
That I can't have her cake and eat it too.

So bring me in and take me down,
There's nothing I wouldn't do.

[CHORUS]
I'm a fool for the taking,
So, baby take me down,
I'm a fool for the taking,
I'm not that dumb, but I don't mind faking.
A fool for the taking,
Yeah, a king without a crown,
A fool in the making,
I can take what you give,
'Cause you got me hypnotised.

Wrapped in your velvet robe,
On your princess phone,
Are you afraid to find out what,
Might happen when I get you all alone?

So bring me in and take me down,
There's nothing I wouldn't do.

[CHORUS]

So bring me in and take me down,
There's nothing I wouldn't do.

[CHORUS]

I'm a fool for the taking,
So, baby take me down,
I'm a fool in the making,
I'm not that dumb, but i don't mind faking.
