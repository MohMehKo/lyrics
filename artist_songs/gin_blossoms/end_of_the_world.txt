If you close your eyes,
You'll see through my winner disguise,
And I'll hold your hand,
You're falling over and over again.
It takes so long,
It takes so long.

[CHORUS]
Oh, running over the edge of a curve,
Now freefalling till the end of the world,
Lost in focus of reality's blur,
We run alone.

Did you know?

You've seen through me,
Inside another branch of the tree,
And I'll never leave,
I'll find you everything you need.
It takes so long,
It takes so long.

[CHORUS]

Did you know?
You'll see,
That you're falling from the edge of the world.
But you know,
Don't believe,
That you're falling from the edge of the world.

It takes so long,
It takes so long.

[CHORUS X2]

Did you know?
You'll see,
That you're falling from the edge of the world.
