Just three days,
And I'm missing you more,
Than I thought I would.
I miss you more,
Than I'd like to say.

I'm hanging on a hope,
That's swinging form a rope,
That's all the same.
My biggest mistake,
Was letting you get away.

Oh baby.

[CHORUS]
California sun,
So bright and beautiful,
Yeah but that was yesterday,
How'd you slip away?
California sun.

California sun.

Been about a week,
And I finally fall asleep,
As the sun comes in,
Through the broken blinds.
Lying all alone,
Sinking like a stone,
Wish you were here,
Can't sleep you off my mind.

Oh no, baby.

[CHORUS]

I'm searching door to door,
Sunset down to the shore,
Where'd you disappear.
I wonder were you go,
I dont really want to know,
You can find me here.

[CHORUS X2]
