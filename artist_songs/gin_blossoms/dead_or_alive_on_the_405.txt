Summer's kickin' in, I can feel the heat
Comin' through my car window
Friday nights are red brake lights
Stuck in here like cargo

Dead or alive on the 405
Traffic's moving like a slug
Dead or alive on the 405
Stuck behind a '68 bug

And I might make a Hummer
If I ever make Redondo tonight

I'm going in cold on a pick-up gig
And in between the classic sticks
You play your hit from '89
I'll sing mine from '95

Dead or alive on the 405
Traffic's moving like a slug
Dead or alive on the 405
Behind some hippies in a '68 bug

And I might make a Hummer
If I ever make Redondo tonight

Just like Ronnie sang, just like Ronnie sang
Gimme my Eddie Money

Dead or alive on the 405
Traffic ain't moving yet
Dead or alive on the 405
Now it's a gray hair in a new Corvette

Dead or alive on the 405
I'm just a cover band drummer
Stuck behind a Hummer
On the 405, dead or alive
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

Dead or alive on the 405
Dead or alive

I won't play Mustang Sally
We'll have write up, Nickelback, L.A.

Dead or alive on the 405
Dead or alive on the 405
Dead or alive on the 405
Dead or alive, dead or alive
