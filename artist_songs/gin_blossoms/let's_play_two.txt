Dig in, girl,
You're gonna get your hands dirty,
Swinging, from your heels.
Roundin' third,
But baby, don't worry,
I'll show you how it feels.
'Cause I camped out at home plate,
And girl I can't hardly wait,

Let's play two,
Me and you,
Let's play two.

'Cause you've been on deck,
Waiting to play,
The sun's coming out,
From a rain delay.
Let's play two,
Let's play two.

From April 'til October,
It ain't over 'til it's over,
No matter what they say.
I know I made a big mess,
It's tough to be so careless,
But I won't let you slip away.
Cause I know I started late,
And girl I can hardly wait.

Let's play two,
Me and you,
Let's play two.

'Cause you've been on deck,
Waiting to play,
The sun's coming out,
From a rain delay.
Let's play two,
Let's play two,
Let's play two,
Let's play two.

Let's play two,
Me and you,
Let's play two.

'Cause you've been on deck,
Waiting to play,
The sun's coming out,
From a rain delay.
Let's play two,
Let's play two,
Let's play two,
Let's play two.
