(Sleepless nights, filled with senseless fights) [x4]

Yea, this is all about your life 
I guess it's all about mine too 
There's a weird vibe in the city right now, 
I can feel it every time that I drive through 
Got married to the struggle said I do 
That beautiful bitch yea she's mine 
But I took another ambien 
and drank another double IPA  
and now I promise imma be fine 
Hold up just hung another list of my goals up 
I'd rather die than be lazy 
Gotta treat every second of my life on earth 
like it's valuable fuck what it pays me 
I don't wanna live my life safely, 
but I don't think the people that I work 
with seem to understand that every time I come  
up in the office that the mother-fuck'n gun up 
in my pockets off safety 
Uh, I need to go to the beach and relax take a 
nice warm sun shower 
Congratulations you got off work 
now you gotta deal with rush hour 
Who the hell lied to society and said  
that this is right and said this is life 
and said if you wanna have a nice kids and 
wife it's all sleepless nights and all senseless fights 
and all

Sleepless nights, filled with senseless fights
(My life is)
Sleepless nights, filled with senseless fights
(My life is)
Sleepless nights, filled with senseless fights
(My life is)
Sleepless nights, filled with senseless fights
(One day my life will be so perfect)
Sleepless nights, filled with senseless fights
(My life is)
Sleepless nights, filled with senseless fights
(My life is)
Sleepless nights, filled with senseless fights
(My life is)
Sleepless nights, filled with senseless fights
(My life will be so perfect)

So perfect 
If I make ten million dollars  
those fancy cars and that jewelry I wont purchase 
I'll move my family up to the woods and buy a cabin 
and communicate through only post service 
So the problems, stress, drama and mess 
of everyday life it won't surface 
I know so many people that have graduated college 
and they sit around out of work bitch 
I know so many people that are 25 and older 
and they just feel downright worthless 
I wish that I could tell ya that there's  
gonna be a day where the adult life bullshit 
we deal with will all stop 
But we started with the cycle on December 
the 31st on new years eve the very second that 
the ball dropped 
one last breath, uh 
the sooner that you realize everyone of us is 
crazy is the sooner you can find a little symmetry  
and try to direct your energy to all the little 
things you don't do daily 
and the universe it never will apologies for 
making you experience the things that you  
experience I think the biggest fear is that 
it's really all for nothing man I'm serious 
I'm sick of all ways waking up and dealing 
with the feelings of the...

Sleepless nights, filled with senseless fights
(My life is)
Sleepless nights, filled with senseless fights

Sleepless nights, filled with senseless fights

Sleepless nights, filled with senseless fights
(My life is all)
Sleepless nights, filled with senseless fights
(My life is full of)
Sleepless nights, filled with senseless fights
(My life is full of)
Sleepless nights, filled with senseless fights
(but on day my life will be so perfect)
