Yo, yellow cheese, eggs, white pancake batter
Put a little bit up on the skillet when it starts to bubble flip it over with your spatula
Yeah yeah, that shit look like my breakfast
I gotta remember to flip the motherfucker over after cookin’ it for 30 seconds
Ladies love me; I got my OJ!
Everybody said to do another fast rap to this beat so I said “OK”
But I’mma speed it up real, real, real fast ‘til the whole damn bottle is gone
And I’m challenging Busta, Watsky and Twista, any of you rap kids: follow along. C'mon

Cook with me now, unh!
Cook with me now, unh! Unh!
I’m making pancakes
Cook with me now, unh!
Cook with me now, unh! Unh!

Fresher than a mufucka
Chris Brown broke up with Rihanna so he’s lookin’ for another silly idiotic ho that he can beat up
I wish that he was man enough to get inside the octagon: I'd kick him in the noggin like I’m Lyoto Machida
Front kick to the face just by me throwin’ my feet up
Winkin’ at Rihanna, baby please show us your D-cups
I’m givin’ it to the man, the cakes are stickin’ right to the pan
Your fate is imminent I’mma diminish it, got the weed to smoke to re-up
It’s done
That’s done
That cake is done!

Let’s go!
Gotta butter up another one and put it on the skillet, couple minutes ‘til it’s done-done
Ain’t nobody fuckin’ with this kid, so tell Jerry Sandusky I’m gonna kill him with a stun gun
Come-come get a-get a-get a-get a crumb
Hit a spitta with a fit of venom when I split a drum
Take another visit in a minute where the menaces to society is In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
You're Danny Devito when I belittle literally it’ll better you
Battling anybody with a better view ahead of you
Like bitter batter-batter I’mma hit you with an auto mo' battery
Bada-bing bada-bada-boom, boom!
I’m the king, better get a clue
Get offended when I’m sentimental and I spit at you
I’m thinkin’ about my rhythm, it's dope and much betta
These rappers think they’re animals: nope, it's Chuck Testa
Gotta get up, the economy's a little brutal to me, the dichotomy ain't suitable
I gotta go to Pluto for a little bit of comedy or something beautiful
There's nothing beautiful about this world
I'm gonna pucker up my lips to barf
Gonna choke a fuckin’ rapper in his hipster scarf
I’m never gonna put another piece of music out deliberately if it isn't genuine and grips the heart
Winter’s hard, so have some pancakes

Made by me mufucka
The Chael Sonnen of rap music
Enjoy your breakfast
Mac, Lethal. Biatch!
