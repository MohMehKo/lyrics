I feel that sting in my toxic heart
I can't heal that thing cause your claws are sharp
It was nothing to you, when you cut me in two
Left me kicked to the curb feeling ugly and blue
I let these vixens capture me
And it's a lot easier than it has to be
You taste like dip spit practically
And that's a flavor of my sick sick rhapsody

I'm gonna shoot my dope in the bathroom stall
Try to turn my woes around
I'm gonna stir my brandy with a nail
I'm gonna guzzle that poison down
I'm gonna spend my rent money at the bar
Because I'm really not all that rich
I'm gonna turn my cell phone off right now
Cause I don't wanna call that bitch

[Hook:]
I love a girl that don't love me
And I call that girl Black Widow Spider
I need to find me a brand new vixen
And bring her back home just to lay beside her
I love a girl that don't love me
And I call that girl Black Widow Spider
I need to find me a brand new vixen
Need to bring her back home right now

On the syncopated measure,
I say a little somethin' to alleviate the pressure
Cause everything about you is deviant and clever
You say we need to treat each other better
You must be joking
I feel like a wounded puppy
Stupid, ugly
You used to love me
but instead of being hurt I'll just think about the time you gave me road-head on my birthday
Tell that dude not to answer your phone when I call you
I'll take a ball bat to his truck
I'd rather just leave you a 45 minute long rant on your answering machine cause I'm drunk
Plus I can delete it all and re-record it
I wanna thank you for the grief and torment
The ghost in the blanket felt like you
And my bedroom fragrance smells like spew

[Hook]

I'm gonna punch me a hole in the closet door
And try to turn my woes around
I'm gonna stir my brandy with a nail
I'm gonna guzzle that poison down
I'm gonna work things out on the telephone
Call one time only, that's it
I'm gonna break my telephone on the ground
So I don't drunk dial that bitch

There's a black raincloud floatin in my head
I always lose at the game of love
I gotta cleanse this nightmare out my system
Somebody wake me up
I'm gonna pop me a pill, gonna die for the girl that'll let me die for her
Cause my ex girl wanna ask me why I feel so strongly like I'm sure
C'mon

[Hook]
