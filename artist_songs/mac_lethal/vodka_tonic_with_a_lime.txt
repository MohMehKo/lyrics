This is that live from the Kansas city sewer rap
These Kiddies want the fast rap, but I ain't doing that
Sony put a quarter million up but I threw it back
Cause I can make 10 million on my own, I ain't stupid jack
This is that fuck a record deal shit
That real shit, that broke up with your girlfriend
Now you needin' time to heal shit
That lethal by design shit, leo fire sign shit
That never be a day you'll catch me behind the time shit
This is that redefine the time shit, Times six.
Rob a rapper's rolex, now his music is so timeless
A lot of rappers keep it real, I keep it irish
Phero Mac Lethal twisting Buddha and Papyrus
And though I'm 30, I've been fresh since all your fashion blog rappers
Were just birdies in the nest
You need to pay Homage little fucks ya'll were 8 years old
When I was grinding trying to pave this road
I ain't mad though

See ya'll are sell out hoes, but me, I just sell out shows
Getting clothes for free
I'm fly but I'm never gonna sell my soul
So we just fuck you ain't close to me
I said I'm looking great, I'm doing fine
I'm out here all the time, on my grind
Vodka tonic with the lime
I said I'm looking great, I'm doing fine
I'm out here all the time
With 100 dollar bottle full of wine
Get it, get it, get it, get it

I smell like good pussy, cause I get good pussy
You fucking skanks after shows and that ain't good pussy
That girl you love I probably fucked her at the Westen
But she say you special like a brother or a best friend
And she don't even let you kiss you little cougher
She out here looking for a real bill stuffer
I got big plans, big dreams, kiss fans, get cream
And never slip into the fucking quick sands or shit streams

Man, these sell out hoes will only love you if you shell out dough
So turn your fucking pimp decibles up and next time she tries to trick of you
Just yell out, no bitch, let's go
And I been flirting with death
Since Raekwon the chef dropped the purple cassette
See I stayed on path so perfect and step and now it's eerie
I'm clocking over 6 figures, yearly
And I don't got a record label near me, hear he, hear he
Lately I been taking trips like Timothy Leary
Minneapolis down to Cape Town, irish is fuck
Whiskey in my cup, kill them with the same sound

I said I'm looking great, I'm doing fine
I'm out here all the time, on my grind
Vodka tonic with the lime
I said I'm looking great, I'm doing fine
I'm out here all the time
With 100 dollar bottle full of wine
Get it, get it, get it, get it.
