I Know in Life I Won't Be
Satisfied Unless I Live
My Life With you, Don't Wanna
Live One Single Day Apart
I Hope I Die Before You Do,

His Name Was Jake O'Brian He Was 17,
Her Name Was Olive Finn,
She Was Everything To Him,
She Never Even Knew Him Till He
Walked Up To Her With A bouquet Of
Petunias, And A Heart So Pure,

And She Was So Pretty, He Thought She
Was The Prettiest Girl In Kilkenny,
He Saved Every Penny That He Had
Working On The Train Tracks So,
He Could Buy A Ring For Her
When He Came back, And He Dropped
To His Knee, Said You Could Marry
Any Man In Ireland Madam But It's
Got to Be Me,

But When She Said No,
He Felt He Had To Go, So he Traveled
To America On A Ferry Boat, But,
Then There Was The Void, Cause She Just
Couldn't Live Without Him, She Was Sick
Without Him, So She Filled Out Immigration
Papers,

And Showed Up On His Door Step 30 Days
Later And Said This,

[x2:]
I Know in Life I Won't Be
Satisfied Unless I Live
My Life With you, Don't Wanna
Live One Single Day Apart
I Hope I Die Before You Do,

They Had 4 Kids Over 14 Years,
And Protected Each One From The Poor
Things Fierce, And Protected Each other
From The City It Was so Cruel,
In The Back Yard Watch The Summer
Weather Grow Cool

And It Was So Pretty, When Fall Came
It Transformed The Whole Entire City
There Was So Much Love' Within Them
That Olive Said To Jake I'm a Stay With
You forever On One Condition
Were Passionate Lovers, Every Night We
Sleep With Our Backs To Each other
Were Half Of Each other,

And I Don't Wanna Sleep One Night
Of My Life Knowing Your Aren't Next
To Me Hogging Half of The Covers,
Promise Me You'll Let Me Die First
Cause I Just Couldn't Live Without
You, I'd Be Sick Without You,
I'd Be A Devastated Lunatic Without You

You Wanna Make My Life Perfect,
This Is How to,

[x2:]
I Know in Life I Won't Be
Satisfied Unless I Live
My Life With you, Don't Wanna
Live One Single Day Apart
I Hope I Die Before You Do,

They Got Old 80+ Years And This Was
True Love Not A Day Was Unclear,
Cause This Was True Friendship, So Even
When The Kids Went To College,
They Kept The Romance Polished

Jake+Olive, Knifed In The Back Yard
Oak Tree, Lemonade, Salad,
Butterscotch, Roast Beef, You Know
That Old Saying Pick Your Poison
Well Olive Was A Smoker, And Jake
He Was Smoke Free, Uh

So When it Came Down To It
Lung Cancer, Chest Tube,
Draining All The Fluid, Olive On Her Death
Bed Looked Him In The Eyes, But She
Didn't Have To Say A Thing Cause He
Already Knew It, She Closed Her Eyes
And Then She Went Through it,

Her Last Few Breaths Were Like Irish
Folk Music, He Told The People At The
Funeral That They Were Happy That You
Knew Us, And Covered Olive's Casket In
Petunias

And Then He Went Home,
He Didn't Feel Quite
Right Sleeping There Alone, He Was
Half Of A Whole, Cracked In The Soul,
He Sat There Alive But His Passion Was
Dull, He Missed Olive,
And He Was So Sick Without Her
Couldn't Live Without Her,

So He Gave His Final Will To His
Neighbors, Fell ill And Died Exactly
30 Days Later,

The Immigrants...
