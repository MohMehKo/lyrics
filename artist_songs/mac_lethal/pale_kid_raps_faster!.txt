Happy Birthday Duriel!
From me and Lauren! 
My name is Mac Lethal 
(But I'm gonna spit some paler and faster fucking lyrics)
Let's go!
Oh hi! 
My name's Mac, 
ecstasy, cocaine and crack, 
none of that 
I just smoke green 
while Chinese people eat your cat. 
Roll by on a low-ride Huffy 
Simpsons on and my beer is Duff see, 
cuff rolled up to my cap, 
cash out the ass cuz I wrote a couple raps with Puffy. 
Gotta be the one to bite the bullet 
I'm a sinner but I bet I could have been a better man, 
I wanna be Zen but I go sipping on some medicine 
instead of meditation but I get it while I can. 
I don't wanna wind up in the gutter with a bottle malt liquor bitter cuz I never got a call, 
But who the fuck drink malt liquor anymore? 
Give me vodka now and start sucking on my balls! 
Motherfuckers wanna have another personal epiphany 
I'm coming with a symphony eliminating everybody/anybody 
roll up like a cannibal and bite em like a peanut butter apple in a minute 
I'mma nibble on a pentagram and every single bitter lamb 
is getting so offended I don't give a damn if anything 
A mental plan is coming with a visually-integrated entity 
And everybody's gonna get the guillotine 
I'm getting cinematic in a matter of a minute 
Every milligram is devilish the Vatican will kill it DEAD. 
Gonna kill it til it's dead, I'mma try to hit'em in the head, corn-fed, 
Midwestern whore bred. She looks so thick and juicy give it to me 
in the booty shorts then you gotta get up in the morning n get out 
(Let's speed it up â€“ big breath) 
Never been a counterfeit of nothing 
I am just an elevated entity 
I'm coming and giving it back
then pumping dump on every instrument with increments of sentiments 
and syllables 
I lunge I'm livid again 
I'm sticking it in their muffins 
make a couple million I'm hoping to I'm going to 
so gimme another reason I should 
sit around an not experience 
benefits of getting down when all 
the drivel that they're spitting 
is so hideous Godzilla fear the viciousness!
