Stop it
I'm gonna be smiling this whole song
Thats not good
Shhhhh

Lalalalalalala....

Theres more to life than love
Cos sometimes love is cancerous too so the answer is you
More than gettin pissed with a black short fuse
Girl theres more to life than those platform shoes
And that make up,  fake nails 
And all the other little things that I'm attracted to

Walkin up and down the sidewalk 
Acting like your the only female with a back tattoo
I gotta laugh at you because I love it
I got a sick and twisted crush 
Exotic and erotic filled with lust
And I'm a probably miss the bus
Just to touch you, to kiss you it feels like sniffin rush

I don't wanna be a rapper with a lexus
I just wanna maybe add you to the guest list
I think females are equal to males 
So I don't really wanna have the battle of the sexes.

Okay

Theres just more to life than that 
What
Theres just more to life than drugs
Theres just more to life than rap
Rap
Theres just more to life than love
Okay
Theres just more to life than that
Uh
Theres just more to life than you
Theres just more to life than rap
Theres just more in life to do

I felt the feeling of what its like feeling depressed
And I don't ever wanna feel it again
So imma write these songs till I cannot move
And the angels are peeling my skin
I felt the feeling of what its like feeling depressed
And I don't ever wanna feel it again
So imma write these songs till I cannot move
And the angels are peeling my skin

Theres more to life than love
But good love got me feeling fortified and bugged
And I just wanna pour my eyes and hug for days
The girl that I mortified and shoved away
Nice guys yall girls don't need em
So imma be a symbol of your freedom
Imma never give a disagreement if your sitting there and needin your space
Ill be at the bar feeding my face

You can bet that in a minute or a second
Imma kiss you on the neck and leave you scribbled in a nexus
Yup
Essentially respected but never in a center with a method that 
That belittles like a sexist
I don't want to be a rapper you're impressed with
I just wanna give a challenge to the best kiss
I don't wanna hold you down and if you question me
Then feel free to just ride on to the exit

Ok

Theres just more to life than that
Than what 
Theres just more to life than drugs
Than drugs?
Theres just more to life than rap
Than rap?
Theres just more to life than love
Okay
Theres just more to life than that
Yup
Theres just more to life than beer
Theres just more to life than rap
Uh
But I still love you here

I felt the feeling of what its like being depressed
And I don't ever wanna feel it again
So imma write these songs till I cannot move
And the angels are peeling my skin
I felt the feeling of what its like being depressed
And I don't ever wanna feel it again
So imma write these songs till I cannot move
And the angels are peeling my skin

Shhh
