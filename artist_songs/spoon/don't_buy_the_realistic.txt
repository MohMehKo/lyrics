All night, be left alone.
Take my, name as my own.
So c'mon and take my hand, c'mon and
C'mon and take my hand, c'mon and
C'mon and take my hand, c'mon and
Take my, take my , take my, take my
Take my, take my, take my, take my
Words are, not much to say.
Face the, gets in the way.
So c'mon and take my hand, c'mon and
C'mon and take my hand, c'mon and
C'mon and take my hand, c'mon and
Take my, take my, take my, take my
Take my, take my, take my, take my
Take my, take my, take my, take my
