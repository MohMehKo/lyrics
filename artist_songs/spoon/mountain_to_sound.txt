Mountain to sound
Mountain to sound
Time's so slow it's barely in person
Barely there, so down
We've been at the airport so long now
We've gone back to sound
It'll come back to you
It'll come back to you soon
Come right back to you
It'll come back to you
And I think I am losing this hard-on
That's okay
All the noise you're playing after hours
Sounds like hot shit to me
All the noise you're playing after hours
You could turn it down
I've been at the airport so long now
Mountain to sound
