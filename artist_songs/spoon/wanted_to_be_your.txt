I wanted to be your friend
I wanted to get to know ya
I wanted, I wanted, wanted to be your friend
I wanted, I wanted, wanted to be your friend
No kidding.
I wanted to hang out some.
I thought when you danced it looked all right.
I thought that you talked pretty cool.
But don't get me wrong I wasn't uptight.
Intentions they fly out the window when you left
The window stay open and light before I said
No kidding.
Although it was nothing heavy
There's things that I could have showed ya
Like how I wanted to be your friend
I wanted to get to know ya
I wanted, I wanted, wanted to be your friend
I wanted, I wanted, wanted to be your friend
No kidding
