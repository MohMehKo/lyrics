Bet you got it all planned right
Bet you never worry
Never even feel a fright
Bet you got it all planned right
Never fit to worry
Never even feel a fright.

Single sleeps alone
And I know you don't really mind
Five years by your side
So I know you really don't mind

But don't you love her
Deep down
I said don't evah
Cause it's gonna keep him hanging around

Never
Deep down
I said don't evah
Because it's gonna keep him hanging around

Don't you never think it's right
Bet you think you had to but it doesn't feel right
Bet you never think it feels right
Famous-sounding words make your head feel light

Petals getting picked
With the love-yous
And the love-you-not

Five years going by
Everyone is standing on their side

But don't you love her
Deep down
I said don't evah
Because you're gonna keep him hanging around

Never
Deep down
I said don't evah
Because it's gonna keep him hanging around

But don't you love her
Deep down
I said don't ever
Because it's gonna keep him hanging around

Five years going by
Everyone is standing on their side

Never
Deep down
I said don't ever
Cause it's gonna keep him hanging around

Five years going by
Everyone is standing on their side

I said don't ever need to worry
Cause it's gonna feel all right

Never
