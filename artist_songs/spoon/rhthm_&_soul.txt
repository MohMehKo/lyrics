Come loosen up,
So hung up
Come count them ways to brether

Remember,
Windsor
Gets cold in ways you always forget

Oh you know
Mmm the rhythm and soul
Get your hands out your back pockets,
Boy let it go

[CHORUS]

Here comes the man,
You saw in Kazan,
He just picks in his cold... oh no...
The rhythm and soul

Dollars and cents and no accident
Not in the name of democracy
Come get there, come be there
Come let your socks fall down to your shoes

Oh you know
Mm... the rhythm and soul
Get your ankles moving their sockets
Ooh, there you go

[CHORUS]

And here comes the man,
He bought a gift from Kazan
He can't leave it alone... oh no...
The rhythm and soul

When you take a picture and it falls in the lot, oh no no
Take another picture and you spring in the trap, oh no no... mm you miss home

You can't back this at your ride
Change of tide
And you're wise, you're wise
Rhythm and...

Tract houses
Square couches
Short legs and square shoulders

Pot holders
Aching soldiers
Your tank rollers
Your all overs

And you know
Ooh the rhythm and soul
Get your fingers moving their sockets,
Tune in Tokyo

You're just the man
The one I saw in Kazan
Wonder what this book will throw... oh no
The rhythm and...
