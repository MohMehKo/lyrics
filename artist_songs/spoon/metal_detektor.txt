Metal detektor ringing as I'm walking through the door
With every chance I take I can feel it start to break
To start to break some more
It's going down some more
I'm going to break the bank of texas and walk out
It's a lie no more
All through with playing the wall
I'm going to break the bank of dakota and walk right back out
It's going down some more
Not going to fake it no more
just going to break the bank of texas and walk right out and
Make the sound of getting kicked when you're down
I'm going to break the heart of chicago and walk right back out
Metal detektor ringing as I walk on through the door
