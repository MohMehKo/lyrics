I wanna change your mind
Said I wanna set it right his time
I'm looking through you
You know who you are
And planning for the apocalypse
Is not considered
Considered cool
I don't suggest it myself
But no I won't sweat

I wanna change your ways
Said I'm gonna get it right one of these days
And I'm looking through you
Riding the brakes
Bringing about the apocalypse
Is not considered
Considered cool
Still you go setting it up
But never give it a thought
Just got setting it up

My mathematical mind can see the breaks
So I'm gonna stop riding the brakes
No more riding the brakes
Instead I'm gonna see your stakes
Yeah I'm gonna see the stakes
