Every morning I've got a new chance
I want to land the part of Eddie in The Stranger Dance
Cause he gets to swordfight the duke
He kidnaps the queen
And you think the score's set but you can't truly see
Till you know the two sides of Monsieur Valentine

Every morning I pull on them pants
But I don't get out so much since I acquired St. Vitus dance
I turn the news on a while
I practice my scene
You think things are straight but they're not what they seem
Till you know the two sides on Monsieur Valentine
In his coat and his boots and his blackheart machine
No, no one knows the two sides of Monsieur Valentine

Every morning I've got a new chance
I wanna play the part of Eddie in The Stranger Dance
He makes love to the duke
He swordfights the queen
He steals the whole show in his last dying scene
No one sees the two sides of Monsieur Valentine
No, no one sees the two sides of Monsieur Valentine
