You gotta feel it yes you gotta feel it
To get it right even one time
You gotta feel it don't take notes
Just clear out your mind
Let go your pride
Feel it inside
It's a it's a it's a 

You gotta feel it or I suspect
You'll wind up where you don't want to get
It's a long way home when you're trying to find your way
With a bag full of books
The notes that you took
A compass and stick
And the sevenths and the sixths
It's a it's a yes sir

To feel it
To feel it yeah
You gotta feel it
Oh you gotta feel it yeah

Oh you gotta feel it alright
Oh you gotta feel it alright
Oh you gotta feel it alright
