Car culture looks out at you
Driving through friday
Night on your own
You don't have to please me
Or pick up my tab
Don't have to go too fast
Just change my life
Change my life
Change my life
Change my life

I miss the way you hold yourself
I miss the sense of wonder inside
Don't want to be your victim for life
Don't want your exclusive rights
I just want you to change my life
Change my life
Change my life
Change my life
