Back in that model evironment
For taking shots in the knees
For planning out your retirement in your thirties
There is no way back from this one but
Oughta wake up and see
And you know its the best it could be

Oh no, I want to know
Are you honest with anyone?
Oh tell me, don't tell yourself
Are you ever honest with anyone?

The aftermath, the promotion
It's time to take the trash out
And redefining what you are
Redefining what you're about
You can't explain the attraction when
Everything gets so far away
Using class to abstraction
Do it everyday

Now all I,I want to know
Are you ever honest with anyone?
All that I, I want to know
Are you honest with anyone?
No no

The aftermath, the promotion
It's time to take the trash out
And redefining what you are
Redefining what you're about
But an expression is anything
You can reduce to a form
Can still make you feel so wiped out
For long

Oh no no, c'mon tell me now
Are you honest with anyone?
All that I, I want to know
Are you ever honest with anyone?
And I say, no no
Are you honest with anyone?
How does it feel to go home
And not be honest with anyone?
