You were smart, you no played no part
You just taught what you thought, yeah

And I remember when you walked out of Garden State
'Cause you had taste, you had taste
You had no time to waste

Oh, what happened to you kid?
Yes and oh, what's happening now?

On and on, and on and on
You never played us wrong, or stayed too long

Oh, what happened to you kid?
Yes and oh, what's happening now?
