1020 am 1020 am
When will I ever see you again
1020 am
When will I ever see you again

I carry you out
It starts to sink in
When will I ever see you again
You'll be with me still
Ever from now 1020 am

Cause I remember everything you did
And
Everything you were
Everything you said
Yeah I remember everything you did

1020 am
When will I ever see you again
1020 am
When will I ever see you again
