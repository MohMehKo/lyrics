I know you must hold secrets
Such a long way from home
You're a lost letter needs delivery
Someday you'll be where you should go
Someday you won't be so alone
Someday you'll be where you should go
Someday you won't be so alone

You coulda been an acrobat
You coulda used what you know
You coulda been what you wanted
You fell for them lines like snow
Press me, I'll tell you I'm looking
Looking for some sign of life
Press me, I'll tell you I'm looking

Come on, give me some spirit
Don't take too much to get me excited
Whisper, I'll listen to hear it
Just show me some sign of life
I know you must hold secrets
Such a long way from home
You're a lost letter needs delivery
Someday you'll be where you should go
Someday you won't be so alone
Someday you'll be where you should go
Someday you won't be so alone
Someday you'll be where you should go

Candyman drives a fast car
He can be there any time
His fuel is anticipation
It's good to feel wanted sometimes
All these expectations
Waiting for my cells to divide
Wait, is that too maudlin?
I'm just looking for some sign of life

I know you must hold secrets
Such a long way from home
You're a lost letter needs delivery
Someday you'll be where you should go
Someday you won't be so alone
Someday you'll be where you should go

Come on show me some spirit
Don't take too much to get me excited
Whisper, I'll listen to hear it
Just show me some sign of life
