Kay made it to where most never been
Fixed up outside and broke within
She always said goodnight
Knowing wrong from right

But on the way the top
They showed her things she never thought
And left her down in the dumps
All day and all of the night

Don't let it get you down
Kay grew up without making a sound
But skipped ahead to settled sown
Aw won't you come out tonight
Don't let it get you down
