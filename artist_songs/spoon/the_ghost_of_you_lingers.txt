If you were here
Would you calm me down?
You settled this part
Feelings I fight (all the strangers in town)
Feeling so bright (would know if you were here)
The feelings I fight (would you ease my mind?)
Yeah (Come on!)

The sleep fled from my eyes
And I, I know that I need some
Give a thought to the one that you know

Or would you calm me down
When the night gets shadowed
We fast

We put on the clinic
If you were here
It felt good to me
(would you calm me down)
Can't see I'm losing it
Must have set up the scene
(The man asleep knockup)
Put on a clinic
(I see it) But I will need to write
(we settled this part) They're all alive

Oh, would you ease my mind?
Yeah

(The ghost of you lingers)
Put on a clinic till we hit the wall
(And leaves)
Just like a sailor with his wools beat soft
Come on

I had a light bad noon that could be put back together

My life
So light
Would you settle this part?

If you were here
Would you calm me down?

The ghost of you lingers
And leaves
I always think about it
Oh, would you calm me down?
