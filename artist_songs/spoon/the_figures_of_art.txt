It's easier to drink on an empty stomach than eat on a broken heart
The figures of art
And that kind of thing only will bring you apart
I'll give it just one more chance
I need to go get some leg and some shine on my shoes
I need a new pair of pants and take part in it too
Like figures of art
Do do do do do do do
It's easier to eat on a broken stomach than drink on an empty heart
The figures of art
At quarter to three where you want to be is hard
