Wendy's walking out alone and it's Saturday night
All the boys act tough but they've gotta bite
When they do they'll get more than a slap on the wrist
And it's clear who's promoting her own myth

So I'll take the fifth
Take the fifth oh

Everybody talks it up all of Saturday night
And all the kids want to brag in fact that they got a right
But it ain't gonna be just a slap on the wrist
And it's clear who's gonna go and promote her own myth

Gonna take the fifth
Take the fifth oh
But I'll take the fifth
I'll take the fifth oh

In back of the room when she walk on trough find 'em stacked against the wall
On the tip of their tongue is the word that all along could turn around the way it'd fall

The thinking about what she's got she's about got me backed against the wall
On the tip of my tongue cause I knew it all along I'd be back there if I wouldn't fall
If I wouldn't fall

If I wouldn't fall
Wendy's out on her own it's a Saturday night
And I've been hanging around as if to save my life
All the girls stand around with their hands on their hips
Cause all the boys have already fallen prey to her myth

But I'm gonna take the fifth
I'll take the fifth oh
And I'll take the fifth
I'll take the fifth oh
And I'll take the fifth
I'll take the fifth
And I'll take the fifth
I'll take the fifth oh
