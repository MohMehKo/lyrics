She's the prettiest thing that you ever did see
You may not see her in the magazines
But I know that she gotta be made for me
Cause we fit together so perfectly

[Chorus:]
Ohh, she's the baddest yeah yeah she's the baddest
Ohh, she's the baddest yeah yeah she's the baddest

I'm so impressed cause she got it all
So beautiful I see all your flaws
I-I like em all, I-I like em all
It don't matter to me, cause I like the way you are
I-I like em all, yeah I like em all
It don't matter to me, cause I like the way you are
Every single one of your flaws
It don't matter cause you got my heart
Cause I like em all, I-I like em all
It don't matter cause I like em all

Ain't no way I could see someone else for me
She's a Juliet in my love story
Back back back it up
Can't no one compete
If I was a snare she's the kick to my beat

Ohh, she's the baddest yeah yeah she's the baddest
Ohh, she's the baddest yeah yeah she's the baddest

I'm so impressed cause she got it all
So beautiful I see all your flaws
I-I like em all, I-I like em all
It don't matter to me, cause I like the way you are
I-I like em all, yeah I like em all
It don't matter to me, cause I like the way you are
Every single one of your flaws (I like em all)
It don't matter cause you got my heart (I like em all)
Cause I like em all, I-I like em all
It don't matter cause I like em all

Ohh, she's the baddest yeah yeah she's the baddest
Ohh, she's the baddest yeah yeah she's the baddest
Ohh, she's the baddest yeah yeah she's the baddest
It don't matter cause I like em all

[Diggy Simmons:]
I like your flaws you are perfect the way you are
All I would change is your name to make you mine
I like your attitude can't even get mad at you
Whether it's Malibu or Jamaica Avenue
With you it's all the same (I like it)
When you wear your hair that way (I like it)
With no make up on your face (I like it )
Mama say, mama sa, mama ma cu sa
Anything that you want I got you ma
We can head to Soho, the boutique shops
On your mark, get set, go shop till you drop
Here's the key, don't let go my heart solo

I like em all, I-I like em all
It don't matter to me, cause I like the way you are
I-I like em all, yeah I like em all
It don't matter to me, cause I like the way you are
Every single one of your flaws (I like em all)
It don't matter cause you got my heart (I like em all)
Cause I like em all, I-I like em all
It don't matter cause I like em all

I like em all, I-I like em all
It don't matter to me, cause I like the way you are
I-I like em all, yeah I like em all
It don't matter to me, cause I like the way you are
Every single one of your flaws (I like em all)
It don't matter cause you got my heart (I like em all)
Cause I like em all, I-I like em all
It don't matter cause I like em all

She's the baddest yeah yeah she's the baddest
She's the baddest yeah yeah she's the baddest
She's the baddest yeah yeah she's the baddest
She's the baddest yeah yeah she's the baddest
