If I ain't got love
Tell me what I got
If I ain't got you
Then I ain't got a lot

Cause I've been waiting all day for you
Going out my way for you
I heard your heart went missing
I'm tryina figure out who get it
Maybe I can go and fix it yea

See, we got nothing but time
But I'm being far to wait
I know you feel what I'm tryina say
So I put my chain on your neck, girl it's bout that time
Are you? Are you about that life?
I've been, I've been, I've been searching for my perfect love

I've been patiently waiting
For you
Waiting
For you

I've been patiently waiting
For you
Waiting
For you

If there's no us, tell me what is that
Spend it all on you
That's a pocket full of lame
I've been waiting all day for you
Got some things I wanna say to you
Everything that I got, you know you can get it
Cause if I'm with you you know I'm a spend it
Oh girl

See, we got nothing but time
But I'm being far to wait
I know you feel what I'm tryina say
So I put my chain on your neck, girl it's bout that time
Are you? Are you about that life?
I've been, I've been, I've been searching for my perfect love

I've been patiently waiting
For you
Waiting
For you

Girl, trust me when I say that
But you are the only girl that I see in my life
Can't wait forever
Grab you on your hips
Kiss you on your lips
You know you're feeling it, don't make this hard
You know I'll be your perfect lover

I've been patiently waiting
For you
Waiting
For you

I've been patiently waiting
For you
Waiting
For you

For you
For for for you
For you
For for for you
