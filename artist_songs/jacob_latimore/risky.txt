Go easy, go easy, go easy

Superhuman, blew me to the sky
Love you, hate you, kiss you, then you die
Why be aggravated? Get another one
Oh, I have tried, I'm taking all the types
They be fine, truthfully special ones
I decline, I decline

Time's running away
No, I shouldn't take you longer no
Even your mind, that said okay
Now it's your heart who won't let you go, yeah

Just tell me what's going on
You been off, going back and forth
I been right here, right on point
And if you dare, you should risk me, yeah
You should risk me, risk me
Loving you is risky, risky
I'm telling you to risk me, risk me
I'm telling you that if you dare, you should risk me, yeah, you should risk me

Darling, my baby, I miss you when you're absent
It feels like lightning crashing inside me, yeah
I walk down right by the ocean
And I be hoping, and I be hoping
That I'm always on your mind now, night and day
I go crazy by my bed

Time's running away
No, I shouldn't take you longer no
Even your mind, that said okay
Now it's your heart who won't let you go, yeah

Just tell me what's going on
You been off, going back and forth
I been right here, right on point
And if you dare, you should risk me, yeah
You should risk me, risk me
Loving you is risky, risky
I'm telling you to risk me, risk me
I'm telling you that if you dare, you should risk me, yeah, you should risk me

Patiently, I hold on
So forgive me I need you more
My God, your glow shine bright
Flex one time when you sex one time
You being you, fire up, up, up
I know I can get you right, oh yeah

Time's running away
No, I shouldn't take you longer no
Even your mind, that said okay
Now it's your heart who won't let you go, yeah

Just tell me what's going on
You been off, going back and forth
I been right here, right on point
And if you dare, you should risk me, yeah
You should risk me, risk me
Loving you is risky, risky
I'm telling you to risk me, risk me
I'm telling you that if you dare, you should risk me, yeah, you should risk me
