Ever since the day you came (the day you came)
I've been entertained
From the way you smile your face
You brighten up my day
And now I know my life has changed
You made me a better man
Now I wanna get out the game

Cause something's got a hold of me
Makes me feel like it's controlling me
Makes it harder to run away
It gets stronger, stronger every day

Cause I think you're wonderful
There's no one like you
Sent down from heaven above
I never thought I'd love again

Then you came and you changed my life
I never thought I'd love again
You're so perfect for me
You made me love again

You made me love, you made me love
You made me love again
You made me love, you made me love again

Girl from all your sexy ways
You got me in a daze
Even from the words you say
You know you're beautiful

From the way you laugh, to the way you kiss
I can't get enough of you
And the way we love
There's nobody else like you

Cause I think you're wonderful
I think you're wonderful baby
Sent down from heaven above
I never thought I'd love again

Then you came and you changed my life
I never thought I'd love again
You're so perfect for me
You made me love again

You made me love, you made me love
You made me love again
You made me love, you made me love again

You are my angel
You are priceless
I can't see myself with nobody else

From the way you laugh, to the way you kiss
I can't get enough of you
And the way we love
There's nobody else like you

Cause I think you're wonderful
I think you're wonderful baby
Sent down from heaven above
I never thought I could love again

Until you came and you changed my life
I never thought I'd love again
You're so perfect for me
You made me love again

You made me love, you made me love
You made me love again
You made me love, you made me love again
