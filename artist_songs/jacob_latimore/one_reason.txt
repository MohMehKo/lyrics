Yo Jacob, tell me how you feel

I knew it's somebody birthday right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
It's some bad ones up in here too
Right now, right now, right now, right now

Walk up in the party like I own it
I guess I'm only here for the moment
Girl the way you're moving got me going
I know I'm young but I can give you what you wanted and more

I only came here for one reason
And I can't lie
I only came for the ladies (Where they at?)
For the ladies (Where they at?)
For the ladies (Where they at? Where they at?)
I only came for the ladies (Where they at?)
For the ladies (Where they at?)
For the ladies (Where they at? Where they at?)
I only came for...
If you really wanna ask I only came for you
I don't mean for me to brag but I know what you came for

I ain't the one to control you
But you the one I need to hold onto
Shorty you come first, I thought I told you
(I'm a give you that
Come here, give me that)

I done been everywhere so you know I like em all
Bright, caramel, dark, short, even tall
I can make you not wanna know me but right now I can't
Cause it's too many ladies up in here for me to pick one

I only came here for one reason
And I can't lie
I only came for the ladies (Where they at?)
For the ladies (Where they at?)
For the ladies (Where they at? Where they at?)
I only came for the ladies (Where they at?)
For the ladies (Where they at?)
For the ladies (Where they at? Where they at?)
I only came for...
If you really wanna ask I only came for you
I don't mean for me to brag but I know what you came for
(I only came for the ladies)
