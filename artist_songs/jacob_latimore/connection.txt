Girl, I love when you naked

Let me swim in your waterfall
Right stroke, back stroke
Baby girl, I can do it all
All night
If you want it, I can prove it to you

Said you like pain, we I feel soldier
Said you like pain, don't say hold up
Said you like pain, no sayin' hold up, hold up, hold up
Break it down as I break it
