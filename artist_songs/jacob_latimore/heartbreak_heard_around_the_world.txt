Ooh, oh, oh,
Oh, no, no, no!

Hell of a night, 3:32 wishing that I was there with you
I'm stuck in the cab, too hard to drive
Yeah, I'm just trying to survive
And I was thinking 'bout love, thinking 'bout us
Living the dream that we dreamt up
Now I was thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout time
Thinking like I'm losing my mind, ooh

[Hook:]
You got me singing like ooh, oh, oh
Never gonna find another love like you ooh, oh, oh
I had another lover but she just won't do!
So I can't take it, so come back home like ooh, oh, oh
Swear to God if you don't come back girl like ooh, oh, oh
This will be the heartbreak heard around the world!

Seem stuck in the maze trying to find,
Find my way back into your life
Dying for one, one night with you!
Just one more chance and that I will do!

'Cause I was thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout truth
What can I do to make it up to you?
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout time
Thinking like I'm losing my mind

[Hook:]
You got me singing like ooh, oh, oh
Never gonna find another love like you ooh, oh, oh
I had another lover but she just won't do!
So I can't take it, so come back home like ooh, oh, oh
Swear to God if you don't come back girl like ooh, oh, oh
This will be the heartbreak heard around the world!

[T-Pain:]
I know why you're trippin'
I got to be honest, I ain't never felt quite like this
Anything you want, if I got it, you got it, baby
I don't wanna fight like this
I was thinking 'bout putting a ring on it,
But it's too late!
I should've give you everything that you wanted,
Uh uh uh
'Cause I ain't never gonna find a girl like you
And even with this auto-tuned you got me singing like ooh, oh, oh, oh
Like ooh, oh, oh, oh!

You got me singing like ooh, oh, oh
Never gonna find another love like you ooh, oh, oh
I had another lover but she just won't do!
So I can't take it, so come back home like ooh, oh, oh
Swear to God if you don't come back girl like ooh, oh, oh
This will be the heartbreak heard around the world!
This will be the heartbreak heard around the world
This will be the heartbreak heard around the world!
This will be the heartbreak heard around the world!
