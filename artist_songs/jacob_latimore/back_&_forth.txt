Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh
Yea
Oooooh
Mmm mmm yea

I know we go through it
You should know that don't mean I don't want you girl
I ain't going nowhere
Better or worse, I told you I'll always be there
Every time I make you mad
Don't I always say "my bad"?
Every time you start a fight?
Don't we always make it right?
See baby, whatever the case
We do what it takes to make it go away

Then you'll be going back back, forth and forth
You be going back, you be you be going back
Then you'll be going back back, forth and forth
You be going back, you be you be going back & forth
Break up to make up - That's all we do
Then you'll be going back back, forth and forth
You be going back, you be you be going back & forth

Sometimes I wanna know
What it is I do to make us argue girl?
But I just leave it alone
Cause the faces you make,
Girl, they turn me on oh

9 tonight I'll pick you up,
Put it down, girl I know what
What it is you like and don't
Baby, that's what makes this work
So I really don't care if I mess up your hair
We gon get a repair

Then you'll be going back back, forth and forth
You be going back, you be you be going back
Then you'll be going back back, forth and forth
You be going back, you be you be going back & forth
Break up to make up - That's all we do
Then you'll be going back back, forth and forth
You be going back, you be you be going back & forth

There's nowhere I'd rather be than here
Here with you baby
Girl you know that you're the only thing I'm on
No matter how much we fight, we always end up right
See baby, whatever the case
We do what it takes
To make it go away

Then you'll be going back back, forth and forth
You be going back, you be you be going back
Then you'll be going back back, forth and forth
You be going back, you be you be going back & forth
Break up to make up - That's all we do
Then you'll be going back back, forth and forth
You be going back, you be you be going back & forth

Back & forth, back & forth
You be going back, you be you be going back & forth
Back & forth, back & forth
You be going back, you be you be going back & forth...
