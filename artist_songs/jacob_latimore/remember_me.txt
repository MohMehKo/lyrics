Trying to hide emotions, your pride won't let it show
And find myself wanting you more
You're so afraid of falling, back to where we started
Can't deny what we were before

So you ain't going nowhere
Used to be us, young in love
Let's take it back right now
You ain't going nowhere
You're still mine, your eyes don't lie
Let's take it back

Remember loving me
I still can light your fire
Remember loving me
I still can light your fire
Remember loving me
I know when we touch, you'll fall back in love
Girl, we know what it was
Remember loving me
I know when we touch, you'll fall back in love
Girl, there's no better us

Can't predict the moment, I don't know where we're going
But here right now is where you should be
So why you hesitating? We both know how it ends
And I don't have to convince you to leave

So you ain't going nowhere
Used to be us, young in love
Let's take it back right now
You ain't going nowhere
You're still mine, your eyes don't lie
Let's take it back

Remember loving me
I still can light your fire
Remember loving me
I still can light your fire
Remember loving me
I know when we touch, you'll fall back in love
Girl, we know what it was
Remember loving me
I know when we touch, you'll fall back in love
Girl, there's no better us

And baby, I'm up now
Remember loving me
And baby, I'm up now
Remember lovin' me
