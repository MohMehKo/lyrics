Something, something I been thinking
See it's something I can't keep inside
See it's something about my foolish pride
I push you aside, I do it outta spite, oh
Gotta say, it's our summer
It's been like 600 days since we been on
Girl, you make me feel like asking baby
I don't mind, you my queen oh no

So don't get irritation, I'm gone for now
You miss me too, I know
Then I get irrational, don't answer me know
Are you fucking around on the long?

Me and you, we been together, that's the strong way
If it ain't less than forever, that's the wrong way
If you can't get it together, then that's a no say
Maybe it''s been getting better
Girl, you know we came a long way
Long way, long way, long way, long way
Girl, I fuck with you the long way
Long way, long way, long way, long way

Don't need a reason, we been up through the seasons
Talking too many Valetines
Are you on it, where's my comfort?
And you put on for me like a concert
That's my bae yeah, that's my bae yeah
She the bae yeah, she the bae yeah
Oh, na na na na
You get anything you want from me

So don't get irritation, I'm gone for now
You miss me too, I know
Then I get irrational, don't answer me know
Are you fucking around on the long?

Me and you, we been together, that's the strong way
If it ain't less than forever, that's the wrong way
If you can't get it together, then that's a no say
Maybe it''s been getting better
Girl, you know we came a long way
Long way, long way, long way, long way
Girl, I fuck with you the long way
Long way, long way, long way, long way

Long way, long way, long way, long way, long way
Long way, long way, long way, long way, long way
