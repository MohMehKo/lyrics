You were my best friend
thought you always be my best friend
We were together, thought you stay with me forever
Sitting here by the phone
Girl you know I been so all alone
Why did it end, where did love go, don't you still love me

We used to go and skating every other weekend
Me and you haning out, best friends no doubt, girl we had so much fun
Me and you playin' in the park all day, haning in the neighborhood chillin' round are way
How I miss those days
A you are the apple on my eye
B I thought I never say Bye Bye
C Leaven in the cherrypie
Why did you have to leave me

You were my best friend
thought you always be my best friend
We were together, thought you stay with me forever
Sitting here by the phone
Girl you know I been so all alone
Why did it end, where did love go, don't you still love me

Ever since you been gone I've been all alone
Thinkin' about yesterday, games that we use to play
glassballkeens, hide and go seek, you're frinds playin dobble dish talking about me
A you are the apple on my eye
B I thought I never say Bye Bye
C Leaven in the cherrypie
Why did you have to leave me

You were my best friend
thought you always be my best friend
We were together, thought you stay with me forever
Sitting here by the phone
Girl you know I been so all alone
Why did it end, where did love go, don't you still love me

Baby I will always be there for you [x4]

You were my best firend 
thought you always be my best friend
We where together, thought you stay with me forever
Sitting here by the phone
Girl you know I been so all alone
Why did it end, where did love go, don't you still love me [x2]
