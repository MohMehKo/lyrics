One thing I guarantee
Is I'll have your heart racing, up and dance for me
Take me, feel the rush
Senses elevate when you with me

Let me be your drug
I wanna be your lover
Baby, I can be your friend
And all the above, girl
Let me be your drug
I wanna be your lover
Baby, I can be your friend
And all the above, girl

Baby, when I kiss you, when you kiss me back
Baby, when I touch you, then you touch me back
Baby, when I love you, then you me back
See you can come a little closer, right where you supposed to be
Baby, when I kiss you, when you kiss me back
Baby, when I touch you, then you touch me back
Baby, when I love you, then you me back
Girl, you know I'm all you need so baby, get addicted to me

Nothing that's prescribed to you
Has the the same sensation than laying next to
So use me, love's dopamine
Now your body's shaking, I'm what you need

Let me be your drug
I wanna be your lover
Baby, I can be your friend
And all the above, girl
Let me be your drug
I wanna be your lover
Baby, I can be your friend
And all the above, girl

'Cause baby, when I kiss you, when you kiss me back
'Cause baby, when I touch you, then you touch me back
Ooh, baby, when I love you, then you me back, oh no no no no
See you can come a little closer, right where you supposed to be
Baby, when I kiss you, when you kiss me back
Baby, when I touch you, then you touch me back
Baby, when I love you, then you me back
Girl, you know I'm all you need so baby, get addicted to me

Let me be your drug
I wanna be your lover
Baby, I can be your friend
And all the above, girl
Let me be your drug
I wanna be your lover
Baby, I can be your friend
And all the above, girl

I wanna be your drug, kiss you, when you kiss me back
I wanna be your drug, touch you, then you touch me back
I wanna be your drug, love you, then you me back
Girl, you know I'm all you need so baby, get addicted to me
