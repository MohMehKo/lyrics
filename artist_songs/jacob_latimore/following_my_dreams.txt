I, I, I could see a baseball diamond in my backyard.
(Ooh, I will make my way)
I could see a baseball diamond in my backyard.

Everybody has something they want to be when they grow up.
It's a feeling you can't explain cause you want it so much.
I could go hang out and play or work on vivid things.
Or the visions in my head could become real one day.

I, I could see a baseball diamond in my backyard.
A house for my mother and a new car.
But I'll never get those things if I don't start now.
I'm holding on, I'm finding strength, I'm following my dreams.
I've come too far, I'm smart enough, no matter what they say.
I'll never give up, I'll hold my head up, can't nobody stand in my way.
I can't go on so I'm feeling strong cause I'm -
Following my dreams.

Some people say I'm too young, that I should go out and have fun.
Don't try to be grown just be a kid.
But I put a lot of thought in this.
I miss the feeling that I feel when I do it.
Sometimes I can't even sleep cause all I see is -

I, I could see a baseball diamond in my backyard.
A house for my mother and a new car.
But I'll never get those things if I don't start now.
I'm holding in, I'm finding strength, I'm following my dreams.
I've come too far, I'm smart enough, no matter what they say.
I'll never give up, I'll hold my head up, can't nobody stand in my way.
I can't go on so I'm feeling strong cause I'm -
Following my dreams.

I can feel this dream coming on, I won't let it in.
Something's gotta get it if I wanna see a baseball diamond in my backyard.
A house for my mother and a new car.
But I never get those things if I don't start now.
