I know you wanna tell all your friends about me
I know you wanna tell your friends about me
I know you wanna tell all your friends about me
But you don't wanna say too much 'cause you know that's gon' mess us up
Girl, I know you wanna advertise it, advertise it, advertise it
It's so good you wanna advertise it, advertise it, advertise it
I know you wanna tell all your friends about me
But I swear that's gon' mess us up, you know these girls be hatin' on us way too much

Flirtin' on the low, tryna see if I'ma go 'cause I know I'm 'bout to blow
It's like everythin' change, you don't know who to blame, is it me or the fame?
See you don't really wanna hide me and I don't really wanna hide you
But every time we break that rule, your mind playin' tricks on you
Like who I'm with, who sent that tweet?
You saw her Snap, how does she know it?
Why she like that pic, did I give her oh?
So tired of this, you can't take this shit

But listen baby girl
I know you really wanna tell somebody about our love
But that's gon' fuck us up

I know you wanna tell all your friends about me
I know you wanna tell your friends about me
I know you wanna tell all your friends about me
But you don't wanna say too much 'cause you know that's gon' mess us up
Girl, I know you wanna advertise it, advertise it, advertise it
It's so good you wanna advertise it, advertise it, advertise it
I know you wanna tell all your friends about me
But I swear that's gon' mess us up, you know these girls be hatin' on us way too much

You too much into your man, gon' start drama you gotta finish
So why you wanna prove all these women? Our love don't need no attention
Gotta stop everythin' that your boy do, for you, for you
Girl, ain't no need to promote what we do, but you, but you
Girl, you know these broads be lurkin'
And every time you post a pic, these niggas be thirsty
And every time they see us out, they be searchin'
Girl, I swear it ain't worth it, but we were every couple's goals

But listen baby girl
I know you really wanna tell somebody about our love
But that's gon' fuck us up

I know you wanna tell all your friends about me
I know you wanna tell your friends about me
I know you wanna tell all your friends about me
But you don't wanna say too much 'cause you know that's gon' mess us up
Girl, I know you wanna advertise it, advertise it, advertise it
It's so good you wanna advertise it, advertise it, advertise it
I know you wanna tell all your friends about me
But I swear that's gon' mess us up, you know these girls be hatin' on us way too much
