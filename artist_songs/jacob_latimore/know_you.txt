I'll remember lonely she wouldn't hold me
Wouldn't touch me at all, I do
And I'll remember cryin
She was the one that if we cryin with no shoulder to use
And I'll remember lies she was one of those types
That would look me in my eyes and lie
And I was almost through until I ran into you
I'm just so glad I met you

I didn't know love till I'm love
I got my hands up
What would I do if I didn't know you
Running out of hope til I'm in love
Now I can stand up
What would I do if I didn't know you [x4]
If I didn't know you.

I'll remember angry
She had some issues that
We couldn't work through.
Oh she reminded of jealous
Always accusing me
And now I bet she's jealous of you
And I'll remember bye bye
She was one of them types that
Was in and out my life all the time
And I was almost through until I ran into you
I'm just so glad I know you

I didn't know love till I'm love
I got my hands up
What would I do if I didn't know you
Running out of hope til I'm in love
Now I can stand up
What would I do if I didn't know you [x4]
If I didn't know you.

I know you're better than I know myself
Thought I knew love but I was by myself
Can't call it love no now we know no on else but you
I'm just so glad I know you

I didn't know love till I'm love
I got my hands up
What would I do if I didn't know you
Running out of hope til I'm in love
Now I can stand up
What would I do if I didn't know you [x4]
If I didn't know you
If I didn't know you
If I didn't know
