Check your watches
Yea
Body like OCD, here to tell ya
Cudos to your craft
Me, I’m like the plane above ya
No need for a landing
You look good like a sculpture
Like somebody’s passion
I startin to get to know ya,
Tell me what your plans is

[Verse: Jacob Latimore]
I had to approach ya, you were sucha talent
Tennis ah like Serena sit up like a stallion
Girl you deserve the finest designers in this fashion
Come take for the little paper
Just to make it happen
Flyin’ around it that rocket
You can call me NASA
Co-pilot of my cockpit I’ll make sure that I strap up

[Pre-Hook]
Compliment my aura, I love you’re decora
Ride around in that Bentley Azure…. ohhhhhhh
Come back to my launch back girl if you ain’t been up before
I’mma take you so high
Crash land in my bed, baby I’mma have you seeing stars

[Hook]
Girl you know we bout to blast off, blast off
Girl you make me wanna blast off, blast off, blast off
Houston, Houston we got a problem
I said Houston, Houston shawty’s a problem
Blast off, blast off, blast off, blast off, blast off
Houston, Houston we got a problem
Said Houston, Houston shawty’s a problem
5,4 leggo leggoo…. 3,2 legoo legoo
1 blast off
Blast off, blast off, blast off

[Verse 2]
Girl you should let me coach ya
You’d be guaranteed to win
Stop messin’ with these suckas
Their swagger need to hit the gym
Once I get hands on ya, you can go nowhere but up
It’s so good it’s necessary so just let me show ya baby
I’m fly and they’re not me, them niggas are the actors
Confident I’m not cocky…. girl you’re the one I’m after

[Pre-Hook]
Compliment my aura; I love you’re decora
Ride around in that Bentley Azure…. ohhhhhhh
Come back to my launch back girl if you ain’t been up before

Crash land in my bed, baby I’mma have you seeing stars

[Hook]
Girl you know we bout to blast off, blast off
Girl you make me wanna blast off, blast off, blast off
Houston, Houston we got a problem

Blast off, blast off, blast off

[Verse 3: Diggy]
Yeahhhh, uhmmmm
No need to tell her,she already know
Don’t miss your chance to make this rocket blow
But I don’t wanna blast off in it
Who you kiddin’, young and gettin’ it
So she want a little Simmons (ha)!!
Shake it like you nervous I work hard so I deserve it
And you don’t get this often so don’t front when we in person
I’m kinda thinking you worth it
So make your way to this room
I bet you’ll be coming soon
I’ll take you over the….. Moon

[Pre-Hook]
