[Verse 1:]
Can I Get A Redo Cause You Know I Need You Even Though I Messed Up In The Past 
I Just Wanna See You I L-O-V-E You Anything You Need From Me Just Ask 
Tell Me What It Takes For Two People To Make Up I Can Try My Best To Understand 
It's Like I'm In A Bad Dream I Just Wanna Wake Up Babygirl Just Give Me One More Chance 
Ohh Ohh... 

[Chorus:]
Baby Can We Try Again, I Can Do It Over 
Try Again, I Wanna Get To Know You 
Try Again, I Can Be The One You Need, Trust In Me, All You Gotta Do Is 
Baby Can We Try Again, I Just Wanna Hold You 
Try Again, I Got Something To Show You 
Try Again, There's Another Side Of Me That You Can't See 
All You Gotta Do Is Try Again 

[Verse 2:]
Baby If You Never Noticed Girl 
You Got Me Open I Wished That You Felt The Way I Do 
Its Hard To Take It Slow When My Feelings Are Growing 
I Wish That I Never Lied To You 
I Picture You Forgiving Me, I Know I Did You Wrong 
But They Say The Second Times A Charm, Heres Where You Belong 
Right Here In My Arms You Need To Be Baby Baby 

[Chorus:]
Baby Can We Try Again, I Can Do It Over 
Try Again, I Wanna Get To Know You 
Try Again, I Can Be The One You Need, Trust In Me, All You Gotta Do Is 
Baby Can We Try Again, I Just Wanna Hold You 
Try Again, I Got Something To Show You 
Try Again, There's Another Side Of Me That You Can't See 
All You Gotta Do Is Try Again 

[Bridge:]
Can We Try It Again... We Can't Let This Be The End Of Us 

Try It Again... Baby Can We Try Again.. 

[Chorus]
