[Intro:]
Hey Ma
You lookin good tonight
Ha' you with him?
Check this out

[Verse 1:]
Ay
Girl that dude that you with (tell him bye bye)
He can't do it like I do it (tell him bye bye)
See his game kinda fair girl ha ha

You know I'm ri-right

Come on baby what's up? (Up)
Leave that small change
I'll give you the real stuff
Let me serve you up
Baby girl, come up love
Send him to the left
Real talk that's enough
Tell him bye bye

Aye, shawty I know just what you like
Aye, and I can get it poppin from the morning to night
Aye, you can't deny this attraction
Girl, I know you cravin' this action
I'll give you that satisfaction
Aye, and you know this, shawty what's up?

[Chorus: x2]
You can get with this
Or you can get with that
You can get with this
Or you can get with that
You can get with this
Or you can get with that
But you already know that this is where it's at (ow ow ow)

[Verse 2:]
You want it all done right (Tell him bye bye)
I can satisfy your appetite (Tell him bye bye)
Aye, so what's good for tonight? (Let's ri-de)
Shawty, leave the lame behind (Tell him bye bye)

Girl, I can change your life
Give me a couple minutes
When I'm with'cha hold tight
Goin' a couple hours
And I bet'cha be mine
Baby if you ready (Tell him bye bye)

Aye, shawty I know just what you like
Aye, and I can get it poppin from the morning to night
Aye, you can't deny this attraction
Girl, I know you cravin' this action

Aye, and you know this, shawty what's up?

[Chorus: x2]
You can get with this

You can get with this
Or you can get with that
But you already know that this is where it's at (ow ow ow)

I know you see

Let me show you your future
You can have it if you just
Leave here with me
Don't even worry 'bout him
And you'll forget him darling
Let a real man show you how it's supposed to be

[Chorus: x2]
You can get with this
Or you can get with that
You can get with this
Or you can get with that
You can get with this
Or you can get with that
But you already know that this is where it's at (ow ow ow)

Aye, shawty I know just what you like
Aye, and I can get it poppin from the morning to night
Aye, you can't deny this attraction
Girl, I know you cravin' this action
I'll give you that satisfaction
Aye, and you know this, shawty what's up?
