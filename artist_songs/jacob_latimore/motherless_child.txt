"Can't she see it breaks my heart to let her hug me,
Tell me how can she send me away if she really loved me,
Been me and her since I set foot on this Earth,
My daddy went M.I.A after my birth,
Everytime I look in my mom I see her dilemma,
I'm the one thing standing between her and being a winner,
And she says how can I ever get it together when you be wildin' out,
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child... No Doubt."

Sometimes I feel, like a motherless child, 
Sometimes I feel,  like a motherless child,
Right now I feel, like a motherless child, 

A long way, from home, 
A long way, from my home,

I wish that I, could fly away,
Rewind time, undo my mistakes, 
Close my eyes, and when I awake,
I'll be back at home,
But I'm a long long way from my home,

Sometimes I feel all alone, (motherless child)
No one to call on, (motherless child)
I'm so far from home, (motherless child)
Daddy long gone, (motherless child)

It's been way too long, way too long, (motherless child)
Mama said she'd never leave, (motherless child) 
And that she always, be there for me, (motherless child) 

Where are you now? (motherless child)
Mama I need you! Mama I need you!! (motherless child)
Mama I... need you... motherless child (motherless child)

...A long way, from home,
A long way, from my home...
