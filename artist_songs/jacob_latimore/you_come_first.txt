[Verse 1:]
Put you on a pedestal...
Take you real high.
Let to see my lady in a way she react
When I keep her satisfied.
Not to stroke my ego...
But I do it well.
Plus she does it better when
I get her to the point but she forget to exhale

[Pre-Chorus:]
Baby girl,
You gon' always get every part of me.
Nothing else.
Even matters when your rivers flowing babe.
Trust me girl,
When it all falls down, we keep it going.

[Chorus:]
Can't help it, baby.
Just got to be unselfish, lady.
And make sure that you come, first.
You can understand, girl.
As long as I'm your man,
You gon' always come, first.
Show you I ain't playing, baby.
Listen what I'm saying you gon' always come first.

[Verse 2:]
Wherever you wanna go,
Baby, I'll take you there.
But I'm a take the scenic route,
Girl I'm a show you, ain't no playing games here.
Give you that inception,
Get all in your brain.
And hit you with a dream, till' you hit that falsetto.
Ain't no way of escape.

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
It's all about you girl,
I don't mind comin' in second.
I'm a let you take the lead girl,
Every time and it's no question.
You gon' get everything you need.
Baby, I aim to please.
Long as you're here with me, baby girl.

[Pre-Chorus:]
Baby girl,
You gon' always get every part of me.
Nothing else,
Even matters when your rivers flowing babe.
Trust me girl,
When it all falls down, we keep it going.

[Chorus:]
Can't help it, baby.
Just got to be unselfish lady,
And make sure that you come, first.
You can understand, girl
Is long as I'm your man
You gon' always come, first.
Show you I ain't playing, baby
Listen what I'm saying you gon' always come,
You gon' always come
You gon' always come, first!
