All you ever wanted was some understanding
Being in this moment wasn't how you planned it
All I ever wanted was to be with you
But it seems like it never goes the way that I wanted it to
All of the shit that I've done, all of the names you don't know
Girls I protected you from, I did some damage control
I was just playing the part, you have been playing the role
'Cause I never would have thought you would have secrets of your own

What if you've been out here like I've been out here
Would I lose my mind or be cool about it?
What if it was mutual, oh yeah
What if it was mutual, oh yeah, oh yeah
I don't wanna think about another nigga touchin' you
I don't wanna think about another nigga lovin' you
And you don't wanna think about another bitch fuckin' me
Well you know it's mutual, mutual

All you ever needed was some love and attention
And just a little time just to show that you different from all them other hoes I know
Just names in my phone, I can feel the difference
You used to be trippin' and now you way too cool, could it be another nigga?

What if you've been out here like I've been out here
Would I lose my mind or be cool about it?
What if it was mutual, oh yeah
What if it was mutual, oh yeah, oh yeah
I don't wanna think about another nigga touchin' you
I don't wanna think about another nigga lovin' you
And you don't wanna think about another bitch fuckin' me
Well you know it's mutual, mutual
