Yea you said your man do what big

Can see the charm, Louie V on the snicker
Baby I’m a star, up in my own galaxy
Up in first place, nothing else come after me
He swag it down loaded, I’ve been owned it
Anywhere you wanna go, that’s where I are
I’mma need you to stay focused, if you’re getting noticed
Baby, you ain’t gotta look far
If you don’t know
Uuuh girl you’re gonna know
Just believe what I said

Bet it, bet it, Bet bet it, bet it, Bet bet it, bet it, Bet

Bet it, bet it, Bet bet it, bet it, Bet bet it, bet it, Bet

I’mma have you right up up in these arms or I’mma nail something
Know something ain’t right
If you ain’t with me girl
Won’t you bet it on some that you never never had, something like me girl
She like the way I swag hard, said I never had a nigga like you before
So I introduce you to the fly life
Them movie lights, Marilyn Monroe
Got a small gap like Keyshia Cole
Back in ’08 but I can fix it though
Your sexy ass, your butt size
I eat it fast like pizza rolls
Me and Jacob on the lady stroll
Y’all chicks are imaginary
I need a girl that kissed a girl and ain’t scared to tell it like Katty Perry
Or the chick from the wild thorn berry
Don’t discriminate, I just get it
In bed I’m the best, they hit at me then uh
Girl put it on something (put it up)
