T-t-t-t take it back ta the the day of the M.J. Thriller
Ba-ba- back in forth like Aaliyah
On the dance floor I'm a killa
Yea your boy smooth it's ice vanilla
Check out the way I move move move
Let me know what you want to do do do
Go ahead you can tell your whole crew crew crew
And then they can decide who's better than who

Usually I ain't the one to brag
I do my 2-step and it takes care of all that
Normally I ain't the one for talking trash
But the music won't let me hold it back

Guess what you ain't got nothing on me
Naw you ain't got nothing on me
Uh uh you ain't got nothing on me
Naw you ain't got nothing on me
Open up your eyes and you'll see
You see the way I be moving my feet
That's the way it's always gonna be
You will never have nothing on me
Naw you ain't got nothing on me
On me (x6)
Yea you ain't got nothing on me
On me (x4)
Naw you ain't got nothing on me

You can't touch this Hammer
I could back it up so it don't matter
My style you can't get enough of
Cause I dot it my way Usher
Check out the way I move move move
Let me know what you want to do do do
Go ahead you can tell your whole crew crew crew
And then they can decide who's better than who

Usually I ain't the one to brag
I do my 2-step and it takes care of all that
Normally I ain't the one for talking trash
But the music won't let me hold it back

Guess what you ain't got nothing on me
Naw you ain't got nothing on me
Uh uh you ain't got nothing on me
Naw you ain't got nothing on me
Open up your eyes and you'll see
You see the way I be moving my feet
That's the way it's always gonna be
You will never have nothing on me
Naw you ain't got nothing on me

I don't know what you heard
But you'll never be on my level, that's my word
If you don't know about me, you better ask somebody
Or you'll find out the hard way yeah

Left left turn around pick it up slide
Down back up kick to the right
... can't keep it up
But she would say nothing on ya
If you still got time, it's tonight 8-9
By the time it's over, I bet you be saying I'm the one

So guess what
You ain't got nothing on me
Naw you ain't got nothing on me
Uh uh you ain't got nothing on me
Naw you ain't got nothing on me
Open up your eyes and you'll see
You see the way I be moving my feet
That's the way it's always gonna be
You will never have nothing on me
Naw you ain't got nothing on me

Naw you ain't got nothing on me
Naw you ain't got nothing on me
Naw you ain't got nothing on me
Naw you ain't got nothing on me
