Got a few decisions in my life
That I got to deal with
Picture perfect angel
I know that she was heaven sent
Me being the fool I am,
Blew it like it was my last breath
Now she’s gone, gone, gone

Does anybody out there know how it feels to be alone?
When your baby’s gone.
When your baby’s gone.
When your baby’s gone.
Does anybody out there know how it feels in this world so cold?
When your baby’s gone.
When your baby’s gone.
When your baby’s gone.
I need some real love in my life
I want it to last more than one night
Cause if I had one wish,
And I was dead broke,
Need somewhere to lay my head,
I would wish for them to bring me my baby
Bring me my baby
Cause I don’t wanna be alone
Be alone
No I don’t wanna be alone
Alone

Got a few decisions in my life
That I got to live with
Many sleepless nights
I cry, try to get over it
Lying to myself countless times
But the heart is hard to convince
Especially when you're wrong, wrong, wrong

Does anybody out there know how it feels to be alone? (Alone)
When your baby’s gone.
When your baby’s gone.
When your baby’s gone.
Does anybody out there know how it feels in this world so cold? (World so cold)
When your baby’s gone.
When your baby’s gone.
When your baby’s gone.
I need some real love in my life
I want it to last more than one night
Cause if I had one wish,
And I was dead broke,
Need somewhere to lay my head,
I would wish for them to bring me my baby
Bring me my baby
Cause I don’t wanna be alone
Be alone
No I don’t wanna be alone
Alone

Does anybody out there know how it feels to be alone? (World so cold)
Does anybody out there know how it feels to be alone?
