[Verse 1:]
I See The Way You Look At Those Guys
And They, they Can Sweep You Off Your Feet
It's Like A Sparkle Shines In Your Eyes
That Makes Me Wish Those Guys Were Me

[Chorus:]
I Wanna Be Your Superstar
I Wanna Be The Only 1 That You Think Of
I Wanna Be Your Superstar
I Wanna Be The 1 That You Give All Your Love

[Verse 2:]
To Have Your Screaming 4 My Poster
Oh Girl (oh Girl), Tha Would Be My (fantasy)
I'de Just Reach And Pull You Closer
And Tell You Girl
That Your Beat Is Fab. As Me
Of Corse I'll Sign Your Autograph
Baby, And Put It On Your Heart
(2 My Number 1 Fan)

[Chorus]

[Hook:]
I Wanna Be Your S-u-p-e-r, Superstar [x4]

[ending:]
I Wanna Be Your Superstar
I Wanna Be The Only 1 That You Think Of
I Wanna Be Your Superstar
I Wanna Be The 1 That You Give All Your Love

I Wanna Be Your Superstar
I Wanna Be Your Superstar
