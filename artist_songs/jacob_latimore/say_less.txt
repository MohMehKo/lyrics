It ain't hard to tell that I got the juice
Got 'em moanin', I got 'em ooh, yeah
They can never have one up on you
I ain't worried about 'em so why are you, why are you?

Stack this money up, watch me get it right quick
Never get enough, on that overtime shift
We can whip and hit the mall baby, you can go and spend it all baby
Make it back and get it too late, tryna show you that I'm on it

You should know I got it baby, say less
Hoes just that's causin' problems, tell 'em say less
What you say? What you say? What you say? Say less
What you say? What you say? What you say? Say less
You should know I got it baby, say less
Hoes just that's causin' problems, tell 'em say less
What you say? What you say? What you say? Say less
What you say? What you say? What you say? Say less

It ain't hard to tell that that thing so fire
You need a long back in the pride
You know you with it, them cakes all mine
Shit, I blow the candles out every, every time

Never get enough, on that overtime shift
We can whip and hit the mall baby, you can go and spend it all baby
Make it back and get it too late, tryna show you that I'm on it

You should know I got it baby, say less
Hoes just that's causin' problems, tell 'em say less
What you say? What you say? What you say? Say less
What you say? What you say? What you say? Say less
You should know I got it baby, say less
Hoes just that's causin' problems, tell 'em say less
What you say? What you say? What you say? Say less
What you say? What you say? What you say? Say less, yeah
