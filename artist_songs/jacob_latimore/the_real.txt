I wanna talk about you
And less about me
I wanna try some new things, new things
Like your body on me
Baby, don't it feel good?
Don't have to keep it low key
Gon' shake it like it's loose change in your frame
Make a nigga say oh wee

You say that I'm just your type, true shit
This is one hell of a night, too lit
Baby, fuck them other niggas, I can do you better
Bet you I can take you to another level, yeah
Skrrt skrrt on them new Perillis
Tryna make it rain with no umbrella

Say oh, if you tell me that it's all real, girl, I can't say no
That's just how you makin' me feel
You make me wanna touch ya, touch ya body
You're lookin' like a million dollar bill
You might have had a few that came before me
Girl you better recognize the real

Tell me what's the move
Damn that body so fye
You make me wanna do things, do things
That's no lie
Yeah that pussy I abuse
Cause it's all mine
You make me wanna do things, grown things
Yeah, me wanna love you long time

You say that I'm just your type, true shit
This is one hell of a night, too lit
Baby, fuck them other niggas, I can do you better
Bet you I can take you to another level, yeah
Skrrt skrrt on them new Perillis
Tryna make it rain with no umbrella

Say oh, if you tell me that it's all real, girl, I can't say no
That's just how you makin' me feel
You make me wanna touch ya, touch ya body
You're lookin' like a million dollar bill
You might have had a few that came before me
Girl you better recognize the real
You make me wanna touch ya, touch ya body
You're lookin' like a million dollar bill
You might have had a few that came before me
Girl you better recognize the real

[IshDARR:]
Girl, you make me wanna do things
Hair whipped, nails did, down to your mood swings
You ain't with that petty shit, pedicure and your fenty slides
On to the next, I'm wonderin' how to make you mine
One time, it's gon' work like this
Keep that 90 bounce, get a boss like this
Pulled off on your ex, lookin' mad as a bitch
Baby let's be real, we only seen in the VIP
You adore me, a glamour stand on every single journey
Hope ya worthy, I probably shouldn't, be damned if I do
Smoke tree, play badu 'til four in the mornin'
Let them assume, no they not important
