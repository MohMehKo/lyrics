It's a shame (how he treats ya)
Taking you love for granted tellin ya lies (to deceive ya)
To me it seems like he's just playin games (with your heart)
And he did something I would never do (to you)
But you would never know because
You're sitting home alone
He's got you, waiting by the phone
Tell me, Tell me what does that mean
It means that you should be with me cause baby
He will never love ya like I can love ya
He will never hug ya like I do
I will never hurt ya like he hurt ya
You gotta believe me babe
I seen a tear fall from her eye
That's when I walked over
Tapped her shoulder and I said hi
Baby I been seeing him
And you what other girl
What did you see in him
You should be his only girl
But you sit at home alone
He's got you waiting by the phone
Tell me, tell me what does that mean
It means that you should be with me cause baby
He will never love ya like I can love ya
He will never hug ya like I do
I will never hurt ya like he hurt ya
