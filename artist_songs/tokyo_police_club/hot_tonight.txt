Standing in a world with a streetlight sun
I don't keep my sneakers white
all I really got is a name and a buck
to get me to another life
and I wonder what you're doing tonight.

I burn the house down
and I leave it behind
I didn't need the money but the money was nice
I need a countdown
when the fire is high
sitting on the curb and it's hot tonight.

2am is bright from this side of the street
tomorrow seems a year away
sitting by the fire and I saved you a seat
you're not keeping track of days
and I wonder what you're doing tonight.

I burn the house down
by the end of the night
my pocket's full of nothing and it's keeping me light
I need a countdown
when the fire is high
sitting on the curb and it's hot tonight.

Drinking in the park
staring at the stars like a satellite dish
I had a good time
and I'm ready to die.

Nothing is enough to anyone else
I wait until they pass me by
standing in a world with a streetlight sun
watch me slipping out of sight
and I wonder what you're doing tonight.

I burn the house down
by the end of the night
I didn't need the money but the money was nice
I need a countdown
as I'm watching it die
sitting on the curb and it's hot tonight.
