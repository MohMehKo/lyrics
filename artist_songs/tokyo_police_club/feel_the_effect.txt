I coming down and now I am writing you back
Because you got your heart broke, I'll take the credit for that
But your still a couple of twins in my eyes they way they reflect
I made a lot of bad decisions I feel the effect

I feel the effect I feel the effect
I feel the effect I feel the effect
I feel the effect I feel the effect
I feel the effect

I turn around and now its faded to black
We left a few things unspoken
Can we leave it at that
And I know youâ€™ve got the world on your side
What did I expect
I made a lot of bad decisions I feel the effect

I feel the effect I feel the effect
I feel the effect I feel the effect
I feel the effect I feel the effect
I feel the effect

I am feeling

I got a friend with a mohawk
He is given terrible advice to me
He is full of quick clips
Has my future on his lips
At least he is working on it working on it
Working for me

I got a friend with a limo
He says he will take me were I want to go
I am rolling with him
But I am calling his shit
He thinks he is a hero he is a hero for it

26 stories high nothing but a ceiling way
Way above you I am over it
Its been a long time

I feel the effect
I feel the effect
I feel the effect I feel the effect
I feel the effect I feel the effect
I feel the effect I feel the effect
I feel the effect

I feel the effect
