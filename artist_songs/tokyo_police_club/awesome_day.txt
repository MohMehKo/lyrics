I was awake, you were asleep
I had a nightmare, you had a dream
And I couldn't find the lightswitch
But I think that I could see
You were in love

Over the moon, under the stars
Falling together, falling apart
And I couldn't find the right words
But I felt in the heart,
I was in love

And everyone was staring at me
And everyone was staring at me
And everyone was staring at me

Now I don't know what's right
And I don't know what's wrong
And I don't know which side of the bed I'm supposed to wake up on

But if you have to go
And if I have to stay
Just give me one more awesome day

Under attack, misunderstood
You were the bad guy
And I was no good
But we fell asleep together (which they say you never should)
And we were in love

And everyone was staring at me
And everyone was staring at me
And everyone was staring at me

Now I don't know what's right
And I don't know what's wrong
And I don't know which side of the bed I'm supposed to wake up on

But if you have to go
And if I have to stay
Just give me one more awesome day

What happens when the money runs out?
What happens when the money's gone?
What happens when you been apart too long?

Does it get better, better, better, better?
Does it get better, better, better, better?
Oh it's gonna get better, better, better
It's gonna get better, better, better

Now I don't know what's right
And I don't know what's wrong
And I don't know which side of the bed I'm supposed to wake up on

But if you have to go
And if I have to stay
Just give me one more awesome day

One more awesome day
