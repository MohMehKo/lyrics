The ocean is incredible deep, from what I'm told
It's an endless body and my heart runs cold
I'm standing still, I'm standing

Somewhere in the back of my mind comes a thought
Like the flash of a camera your parents bought
I'm standing still, I'm standing still

So we are alone
And we are together for just this once
I'll go on pretending I don't care
But I'm asking you nicely to stand here beside me

Yeahhh
I had a little too much to drink
Yeahhh
It goes down a little faster than I think

Everybody circles the sun on New Years Eve
Like the great parade that you just cant leave
We're standing still, we're standing still

Somehow in a crowded room I saw your face
Like an old toy soldier glued in place
We're standing still, we're standing still, we're standing still

So we are alone
And we are together for just this once
I'll go on pretending I don't care
But I'm asking you nicely to stand here beside me

Yeahhh
I had a little too much to drink
Yeahhh
It goes down a little faster than I think

Is it really gonna be okay?
Is it really gonna be okay?
Is it really gonna be okay?

I'm standing still, I'm standing still
I'm standing still, I'm standing still

So we are alone
And we are together for just this once
I'll go on pretending I don't care
But of course I do

So we are alone
And we are together for just this once
I'll go on pretending I don't care
But I'm asking you nicely to stand here beside me

Yeahhh
I had a little too much to drink
Yeahhh
It goes down a little faster than I think

Is it really gonna be okay?
Is it really gonna be okay?
Is it really gonna be okay?

I'm standing still, I'm standing still, 
I'm standing still, I'm standing
