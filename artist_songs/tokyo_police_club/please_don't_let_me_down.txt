It's got a lot to do with the way she talks so close to me
It's got a lot to do with the way she moves
But that's the way I'm programmed so there's not much I can do
I wonder if it's real or if it's not supposed to be?

Cuz now I got a picture and I keep it in my heart
Lemme hear you say

Love, please don't let me down
Love, I'm getting closer
Love, please don't let me down
Love, I'm getting closer, a little bit closer

It must have been the way I answered every single call
It must have been the way I made her start
Cuz she's the queen of dreamers and somehow I won her heart
Maybe I am lonely on the [?]

Cuz then I heard her whisper and I followed her away

Love, please don't let me down
Love, I'm getting closer, a little bit closer

And maybe I should be more careful around you
But that's the way you have me
And maybe there's not much I can do
So lemme hear you say

Love, please don't let me down
Love, I'm getting closer
Love, please don't let me down
Love, I'm getting closer, a little bit closer
