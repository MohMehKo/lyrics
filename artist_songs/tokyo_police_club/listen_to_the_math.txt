You've been famous since your birth
And a silent one it was, 
Til they told me it was a girl
And everybody gasped

I know how to raise you right
Teach you how to read
And your maths (?) and alphabet
And how to be polite

You've been famous since your birth
And a silent one it was, 
Til they told me it was a girl
And everybody said

You and your atlas know it all
Let the corners curl
Cause if you go by night
You'll hit the coast for sure

It's a ruse, it's a laugh
Experts, they'd agree
Listen to the math
(?), with the scene
Rekindle your heart
These hospital machines
Are state of the art

I've put down my middle name
In the back of her book
And signed it just in case
Our walk was over love

Cause I've got one more up my sleeve
Bring it out tonight
Cause if I am the joke
Then you're the punchline

It's a ruse, it's a laugh
Experts, they'd agree
Listen to the math
(?), with the scene
Rekindle your heart
These hospital machines
Are state of the art

But it's the art of the state
That's gonna keep me awake
I need a second opinion
Not a second to waste
