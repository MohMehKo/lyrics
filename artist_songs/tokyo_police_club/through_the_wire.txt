Through the wire to your door, through the wire
Through the wire to your door, to your door

I'm killing time until I see her
So many days but I don't care
I'm sleeping alone, even the warm night's cold
But I got her picture and I'm always coming home

Through the wire to your door, through the wire
Through the wire to your door
I'm coming around, ones and zeros on the ground
I'll be your man, through the wire I am bound

I know she's saving me a pillow
She couldn't tell a single lie
I'm coming around, I'm gonna be laying her down
Almost the real thing, gets me close enough to now

Through the wire to your door, through the wire
Through the wire to your door
I want to be there, ones and zeros in the air
I'll come in a second, through the wire and I'm there, and I'm there

I the key face
Holding the keys to your place
There's nobody else, I lie and wait by myself
And count the days
I keep your pictures on the train
Don't give it away
I'll do whatever it takes

Through the wire to your door, through the wire
Through the wire to your door
I'm coming around, ones and zeros on the ground
I'll be your man, through the wire I am bound
