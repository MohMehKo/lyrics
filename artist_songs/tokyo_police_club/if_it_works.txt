We get our nerves of steel
When the balaclavas go on
We're just not used to ourselves
If it pays then it sells our hides

I wake for every meal
But I still set a place for you
We're looking out for you son
We fear the worst but it's done

The factory has treated you well
The coals burn colder
The factory has treated you well
The coals burn colder
But in a part of the heart of the hearth
It still swells

We get our nerves of steel
When the balaclavas go on
We're just not used to ourselves
If it pays then it sells our hides

The factory has treated you well
The coals burn colder
The factory has treated you well
The coals burn colder
But in a part of the heart of the hearth
It still swells
