Breakneck speed
Tying up your hands
'cause you're landing back on your feet
You know what I mean

Vowel change
I remember when our voices used to sound the same
Now we just translate

'cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
After what you did
Born on your feet, running
Forest fires underneath your bed

But it's good to be back
Good to be back
Good to be back

Spell it out
I always skip the words
'cause all the pictures are so bright and loud
Better off than now

'cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
After what you did
Born on your feet, running
Forest fires underneath your bed

'cause it's good to be back
Good to be back

Super fun
At the movies, drunk and young
Double knots that came undone

But the big bad years are gone
Yeah, the big bad years are done
And gone away
I remember when our voices used to sound the exact same
Now we just translate

'cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
After what you did
Born on your feet
Running, forest fires underneath your bed

But it's good to be back
Good to be back
Good to be back
