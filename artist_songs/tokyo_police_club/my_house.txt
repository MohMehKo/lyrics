Someone I know very, very, very well is spilling my secret
They're underneath my spell
Someone I like, baby just a little bit is making me seasick
It's funny how you can tell

Any old day now
Any old day now
Any old day now
The truth is gonna come out

I could see it from my house
I could see it from my house
You were screaming your heart out
You were screaming your heart out

Whatever you do, I guess it doesn't matter if no one else knows it
Did you even think twice?
Whatever you want, just come out and say it and you can just have it
Do you really feel bad?

Any old day now
Any old day now
Any old day now
The sun is gonna come out

I could see it from my house
I could see it from my house
You were screaming your heart out
You were screaming your heart out

I just can't keep it down
I just can't keep it down, down, down, down

I could see it from my house
I could see it from my house
You were screaming your heart out
You were screaming your heart out
I could see it from my house
I could see it from my house
You were screaming your heart out
You were screaming your heart out
