You been making conversation but it's just a string of empty words
You've been carving out a smile when all you wanna do is burst
Well there's nothing you could hide that could ever be too dark to tell
And I'm crossing all my fingers that you'll come out of your shell

Now you can hang your heart up on my wall
Just the way it is, the way you are
Yeah you can hang your heart up on my wall
I won't let it down, won't let you fall

I been trying to put my finger on the thing that really makes you glow
I been soaking up your eyes and you don't even seem to know
I know it's not easy, and I know it gets so dark
But I'm sure it would be harder if I didn't have your spark

Yeah, hang your heart up on my wall
Just the way it is, the way you are
I need you to hang your heart up on my wall
I won't let it down, won't let you fall

And we're gonna make it through, and we're gonna see the light
And I'm gonna keep a place for you inside, to hang your heart
And when someone else is down you can take your turn and say
There is nothing that you need to hide away

Just hang your heart

Hang your heart up on my wall
Just the way it is, the way you are
Hang your heart up on my wall
I won't let it down, won't let you fall
