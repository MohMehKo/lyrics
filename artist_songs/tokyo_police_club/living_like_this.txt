I guess I knew that she was someone's daughter
They found her lying on the broken glass
Waiting for the cars to pass

I heard she wanted to become an actor
And she was saving up to move west
Keep it underneath your breath

Well I'm half awake or I'm half asleep
But it don't make sense to me

Tell me if you call this living
Tell me if you call this living

I have a photo from when he was younger
A leather jacket and a quarterback
His story never stays on track

I can hear it calling, calling to me
I can see it clear, clear as the day
I've been waiting for it, waiting around

Well I'm half awake or I'm half asleep
But it don't make sense to me

Tell me if you call this living
Tell me if you call this living

Someday we'll go so far away
I don't want to call this living

Just a ghost ahead of me
Just a ghost I could have been
Just a ghost, a ghost

Tell me if you call this living
Tell me if you call this living
Someday we'll go so far away
I don't wanna call this living
I don't wanna call this living
Tell me if you call this living
