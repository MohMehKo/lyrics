Going to the sweet store tell me what you want
I'll pick us up some liquor and a pack of Belmonts alright
Twenty-four seven and the lights stay on
You like a lot of people and I'll make a good drunk alright

But I got the tunnel vision, can't see the light
I just want to make it through one more night, tonight
I just want to make it through one more night, tonight

Even on the week nights all my friends say
You're still in your twenties and you're still getting paid, it's fine
Nothing is enough and gonna slip away
I might be dead tomorrow but tomorrow's not today

I got the tunnel vision, can't see the light
I just want to make it through one more night, tonight
I just want to make it through one more night, tonight

I can barely move a muscle and there's still no end in sight
And I just want to make it through one more night
So walk me home so walk me home so walk me home
Cause I got the tunnel vision, can't see the light
I just want to make it through one more night, tonight
I just want to make it through one more night
