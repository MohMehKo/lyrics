I guess that we were both out of place
You said the music sucks
I got your number on the way back home
and I thought I was in love.

I check my phone every minute now
All messages read
My best friend says its probably fine and I should go out instead
But my batteries are dead.

You don't have to tell me much
Just keep me in or out of touch
Am I losing you?
I wish I could hide it away but I can't keep pretending
Losing you
I'm out of my mind but I can't look away from the ending
Never tell me the ending, never tell me the ending.

Now I dream up a story
Some bizarre event
Kidnapped by aliens before your message sent
How am I supposed to fall in love if I don't get a chance
I'm not trying to put a ring on it just give me the first dance
When the music doesn't suck.

You keep me hanging on every word
Just let me know for sure
Am I losing you?
I wish I could hide it away but I can't keep pretending
Losing you
I'm out of my mind but I can't look away from the ending
Never tell me the ending, never tell me the ending.

Maybe you're out there on your own
Not likely
Maybe you've moved on down the road
I'm freaked out, I keep thinking
You might be.

Just keep me in or out of touch
Am I losing you?
I wish I could hide it away but I can't keep pretending
Losing you
I'm out of my mind but I can't look away from the ending
Losing you, losing you
Am I losing you?
I wish I could hide it away but I cant keep pretending
Try but I cant look away from the ending
Never tell me the ending, never tell me the ending.
