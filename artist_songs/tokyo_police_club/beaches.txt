All together now,
Just a shadow in an open doorway
Turning around, turn away
I used to write your name across beaches

I'll fall apart and hit the ground
Are you there? (oh oh oh)
I am waiting at the top of the stairs
You can find me in the dead of the night
I am waiting for a knock on the door
You can call me to say that you were right

You’re right, I wish I wish I had never to you a lie
Are you gone are you there or out of sight

Uhoh

Happens all the time
Two sides of an endless story
This story is mine, (turn the page)
People write their names across beaches

I am fading into the tide are you there?

I am waiting at the top of the stairs
You can find me in the dead of the night
I am waiting for a knock on the door
You can call me to say that you were right
You’re right, I wish I wish I had never to you a lie
Are you gone are you there or out of sight

Open the window
Passenger side
Holding your hands out at mine

Out of your mind

I am waiting at the top of the stairs
You can find me in the dead of the night
I am waiting for a knock on the door
You can call me to say that you were right
You’re right, I wish I wish I had never to you a lie
Are you gone are you there or out of sight
