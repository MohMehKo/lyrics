Pack your ashes pack a watch
Change of clothes and a face cloth
Meet me where your mother lies
We'll dig graves on both her sides
And lay ourselves inside
A thousand suns will set and then rise

A hair tangled up in hers
Fingernails beneath the dirt
Sharing all her black and greys
And blood running through her veins
And even as we came
Our bodies are one and the same
