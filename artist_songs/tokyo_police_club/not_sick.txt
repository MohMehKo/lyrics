Get comfortable, get unfrustrated
Get healthy, and all the things that you want

I do, I do, I do not
Fuck with the sure shot
Not serious, about the way that you are

Carolina, happy belated
Always golden, still the greatest

Not sensible, I wanna marry a dancer
Vegetarian, can't stand to be wrong

I do, I do, I do not
Fuck with the sure shot
Not serious or taken seriously

Oh Carolina, happy belated
Always golden, still the greatest

'cause it's there on the tip of your tongue,
On the back of your hand,
In the place that you had it last,
You need to be careful

All in a single night,
In a single dose,
Is the best of the best for me,
So what do you need, what do you need, what do you need?

Is it a call for an emergency?
So what is it like
For your song on karaoke night?

Oh Carolina, happy belated
Always golden, still the greatest
