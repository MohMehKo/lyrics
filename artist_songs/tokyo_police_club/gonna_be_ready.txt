I am gonna be ready
Still number one
Never let anybody touch you
Cold, colder than anyone
You feel it all a moment later than I do

And every time I drive in the city, 
I think see you turning around
Upset incredible headache
How bad? I am calling a medic

I am gonna be ready

Wait for the heat to break
Your doing fine on your own
Cold, colder than anyone
You feel it all a moment later than I do

And every time I drive in the city, 
I think see you turning around
Upset incredible headache
How bad? I am calling a medic

I am gonna be ready
Let down I keep it together
Upset, I have never been better

I gonna be ready

Living in the mind of girls
Who would never say shit to me now
As pretty as they were in high school
I wonder if I'll see them around, around

Upset incredible headache
How bad? I am calling a medic

I gonna be ready

Let down I keep it together
Upset, I have never been better
I gonna be ready
