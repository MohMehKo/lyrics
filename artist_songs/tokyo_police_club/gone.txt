Gone to the coast
Gone to the coast where I let my hair down
(down)
Out on the beach
Out on the beach where I let my ship sail
(sail)

Gone to the coast
Gone to the coast where I let my hair down
(ooh)
Out on the beach
Out on the beach where I let my ship sail
(ooh)

'cause I don't know what I want
I don't know what to think with both the curtains drawn
And I don't know about you
Tell me something that I'm supposed to do

Runners don't run to me, runners don't say the same old things
Racers don't bother me, racers don't say the same old things
But you always do
