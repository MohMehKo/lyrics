A toast to the last of a dying breed
They're crawling back to bed
They're falling back to sleep

A chill touches the base of your neck
Who'd call by at this hour?
Who's standing at my step?

Alright, we tried to help
Alright, we tried to help
So pull back the covers tonight

I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong
That end was meant for you
Since before you were born

So here's to the last of a dying breed
They're crawling back to bed
They're falling back to sleep

Alright, we tried to help
Alright, we tried to help
A shit sigh, you've got no act
Loosen up those muscles
Straighten up that back

Alright, we tried to help
Alright, we tried to help
So pull back the covers tonight

A toast to the last of a dying breed
They're crawling back to bed
They're falling back to sleep

A toast to the last of a dying breed
They're crawling back to bed
They're falling back to sleep
