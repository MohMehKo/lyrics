You wrap me in your spider silk 
And gave me hope for the worst disease
'Cause while your standing by my side
You break my bones and drain my arteries

Both your ventricles start beating,
Pressure builds
Mark a groove in your heart
Gaping empty holes
But no-one knows 

Collect my blood as it pools on the floor
Keep it in bottles on the higher shelf
So when you want to be with me once more
I'll reassemble from my cells 

Both your ventricles start beating,
Pressure builds
Mark a groove in your heart
Gaping empty holes
But no-one knows 

When atriums beat & ventricles meet [x3]
