Classics in the modern age
Sixties remake
Everything you've got in spades
Your collarbone, shoulder blades

(Hey!)
Bat your lips
Shut your eyes
(Hey!)
Swing those chains
And start a fight
Cause you've got nerve
But we've got tapped
Going back in the city hurt

Taking to the streets at night
Home alone, tucked in tight
Everything you've got in spades
Your sixties remake

(Hey!)
Bat your lips
Shut your eyes
(Hey!)
Swing those chains
And start a fight
Cause you've got nerve
But we've got tapped
Going back in the city hurt

It's how I was
It's how I tried
I was sixteen for the night

It's how I was
It's how I tried
I was sixteen for the night

Cause you've got nerve
But we've got tapped
Going back in the city, hurt

Cause you've got nerve
But we've got tapped
Going back in the city, hurt
