Ten thousand feet took me by surprise
Can't even remember which way is home
Tiny little people, tiny little cars
It's a real small world when you're way up high

And things seem blurry when I'm looking down
And all my senses start to stop

Cause I get vertigo
Cause I get vertigo
Every time

Ten thousand feet is a long way down
I can't even remember which side I'm on
Pushing up the daisies, or pushing for a raise
It's a big bad world until you're underground

Should I be worried when I get this way
Cause I can't tell which way is up

I get vertigo
I get vertigo
Everytime
I get vertigo
I get vertigo
Everytime

My heart goes over the edge
I see it all in my head
Going down down down down

Cause I get vertigo
Cause I get vertigo
Everytime
I get vertigo
I get vertigo

I get vertigo
I get vertigo
I get vertigo
I get vertigo
Everytime
Everytime
