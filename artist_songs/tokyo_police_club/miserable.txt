I want to travel to the future again
I want to travel to the future
I want to travel to the future again

I heard about from a friend of a friend
I heard about from a friend of a friend

Are you miserable?
I am totally blinded by the sun in my eyes
Are you miserable?
I feel like the only one who gets his way sometimes

I want to live in the Bahamas uh huh
I want to live int the Bahamas with you
I heard about from a friend of a friend
I heard about from a friend of a friend

Are you miserable?
I am totally blinded by the sun in my eyes
Are you miserable?
I feel like the only one who gets his way sometimes

Are you miserable?
Do you get miserable?
Are you miserable?
Do you get miserable?

Made it back, can I come inside for a change?
Made of glass and falling fast all the way!

Ill say it once and ill say it again

Act nice, but my body is fallen’ apart
Dress rich but my body is fallen’ apart
Keep going but my body is fallen’ apart

Act nice, but my body is fallen’ apart
Dress rich but my body is fallen’ apart
Keep going but my body is fallen’ apart

I want to travel to the future
And get away

Are you miserable?
I am totally blinded by the sun in my eyes
Are you miserable?
I feel like the only one who gets his way sometimes

Are you miserable?
Do you get miserable?
Are you miserable?
Do you get miserable?
