With a heart-attack on your plate
You were looking back on your days
How you spent them all in a blur
When they asked if you were for sure

Let the sugar melt down your throat
'Cause you know it's sweet getting old
With a lollipop and a rose
Let the hospital be your home

'Cause your knees are scratched and your eyes are black
Put a plaster there and I'll sign your cast

In the liner notes at the end
Some familiar names in tiny print
On the cover page of the year
Grainy photographs, greasy hair

But it's noon o'clock and you're still asleep
And your coffee's cold, your coffee's icy

'Cause your knees are scratched and your eyes are black
Put a plaster there and I'll sign your cast

Classic Hollywood is a kid
With the volume up all the way
Now you do the same and you're right
Things are better in black and white

But there's another girl and another day
And your favourite food still tastes the same

'Cause your knees are scratched and your eyes are black
Put a plaster there and I'll sign your cast
When the best and the brightest turn their televisions on
Have your seatbelts strapped and your helmets on
