It's been a blast
But we've been caught
Packing up your suitcase
Hard day, long face
Get the story right
Get the story right
Get the story down

Waltzing right out of the room
Be good when your parents stay over in June

It's been alright
But we have fought
Ways of the samurai
Perry thrust, do or die
Not the fighting type
Not the killing kind
Get the story down

Waltzing right out of the room
Be good when your parents stay over in June

I heard the news
I'll send a card
Cellar door, Friday night
Long johns, hold tight
Put it on a page
Put it on a line
Get the story down

Waltzing right out of the room
Be good when your parents stay over in June

C'mon and say RAC
RAC, RAC, RAC, RAC...
