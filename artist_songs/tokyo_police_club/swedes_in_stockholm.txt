You know you should 
Cause its been a while
Every swede in Stockholm 
Thinks your in his ride

Its in my blood and my guilty smile
In my school of thought we like to try and call it out

I won't be here for long
I'm leaving in a while
This could be my very last song
But if I'm leaving then I'm leaving in style

You go out a night
In the witching hour
I don't drive a car but I run pretty fast
Just like my dad

I didn't wear my seat belt
Cause someone told someone else
That every bounty hunter in the world is out to get me
I gotta watch my step yeah

I won't be here for long
I'm leaving in a while
This could be my very last song
But if I'm leaving then I'm leaving in style
