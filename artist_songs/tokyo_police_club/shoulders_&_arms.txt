Another stone rolls over 
The republic is just one more year older 
But way out in the distance 
We see your white boots glisten in the sun 

We know you've come here with a plan 
To lift our city out of ruin 
Shoulders back and arms at our sides 
We sincerely hope you know just what you're doing 

Another stone rolls over 
The republic is just one more year older 
But way out in the distance 
We see you draw your pistols and aim at us 

At first we try to reason with you 
But you suggest we say our prayers 
Shoulder back and arms in the sky 
We sincerely hope you live a better life 

Cause you 
You're so calm 
I don't know where you are from 
You 
You're so young 
I don't care what you've done wrong
