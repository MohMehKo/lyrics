(Operator, get me the President of the world. This is an emergency.)

Do your neighbour a favour.
Collect their morning paper
And clip out all the sad bits, no one wants to read that.
Let them take their kids to school and the zoo in peace.

When you're standing near,
Tokyo Police Club.
When you're standing next to me,
Tokyo Police Club.
When you take the tunnel,
Arresting you for being in love.

Caught the fever that's spreading
Do you have a warm bed we could stay the night in
It's all sick boys in this house, no one wants to feed us
Dumb kid you should have hid you'd stand a better chance there

When you're standing near,
Tokyo Police Club.
When you're standing next to me,
Tokyo Police Club.
Lost in the Pacific
Arresting you for being in love.
