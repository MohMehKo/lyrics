Liberated, I am liberated enough
I am taking one last look as I leave it to rust
'cause it seems to me
I am just another jagged gentlemen we’re both cut of the same stuff
Are you thinking what I am thinking of

Celebrated, I celebrate it enough
I take a deep deep breath
And its filling my lungs
And I start to feel
Like I am another shining stone among the everlasting rough
Are you thinking what I am thinking of?
Are you thinking what I am thinking of?
Are you thinking what I am thinking of?

When every other kid on the block has a shotgun
I've never known the difference between the toys and the real ones
When every other kid on the block has a problem
I'm just one I'm just one

Wooooooooohh

Educated, I am educated enough
Every book has been covered covered in dust
And I start to feel
I am just another jagged gentlemen we’re both made of the same stuff
Are you thinking what I am thinking of?
Are you thinking what I am thinking of?
Are you thinking what I am thinking of?

When every other kid on the block has a shotgun
I've never known the difference between the toys and the real ones
When every other kid on the block has a problem
I'm just one I'm just one

Conversations I've repeated
All forgotten names deleted

Wooooooooh

When every other kid on the block has a shotgun
I've never known the difference between the toys and the real ones
When every other kid on the block has a problem
I'm just one I'm just one

Liberated, I am liberated enough
I am taking one last look as I leave it to rust
