Oh what a girl
I wish I had another sister
For me
I’d take her to the park
While you were at work

How many kinds of people do you think there really are
For me?
Enough to fill a room
Enough to fill a mall

One sunset falls on the sea
You are not crying

Oh what a girl
I wish we had a conversation
Face to face
Cuz when you speak
You speak in waves

But then you go into your secret place and hide
From me?
I wanna look in all the dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark comers

One season you wait and see
You are not crying

One lover turns into me
You are not crying
For me

Oh Argentina

Born in 1988
Give or take
We share bottles
We share gum
When you smile
You smile with all your teeth at once

Oh what a girl I want you wearing my t-shirt
XL
Yeah, you wear it well

How many kinds of people do you think there really are
For me?
I want to see you in the bright, bright, bright, bright, bright, bright, bright, bright morning

One sunset pink on the sea
You are not crying

One lover turns into me
You are not crying
For me

Oh, Argentina

Born in 1988
Give or take a year or month a wedding day
We share bottles
We share gum
When you smile
You smile with all your teeth at once

And when you smile with all your teeth
Yeah, I’m done

And when you smile with all your teeth
Yeah, I’m done

I don’t want to want you like I want you
I don’t want to want you like I want you
I don’t want to want you like I want you
I don’t want to want you like I want you
I don’t want to want you like I want you

Television wakes me up
With the sound of a gun
Feeling like I’m here alone
But I’m not the only one

You were lying next to me
Wearing someone else’s clothes
Have I been asleep for long
In the informercial glow

Now I see the things that I have done
Everything in focus all at once

When I was an infant
I could see it clear

When I was a lover
I could see it clear

And yeah
I could be a fool

Sometimes

But I was a lover
And I could see it clear

‘Cause if I had known
That you were
Only here for the weekend

‘Cause if I had only known
What you were thinking

I would have been
So, so, so, so
Much nicer

So, so, so, so
Much nicer

If I was a lighthouse
I would look all
Over the place

If i was an asshole
Thank you for keeping
A smile on your face

And yeah
I could be a fool
Most of the time

But I was a lover
And I could see it clear

‘Cause if I had known
That you were
Only here for the weekend

‘Cause if I had only known
What you were thinking

I would have been
So, so, so, so
Much nicer

So, so, so, so
Much nicer

Yeah

I can see it
I can see it
Clear

I can see it
Clear
