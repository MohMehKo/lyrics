She came from the west
A little country at dress
Where her life flashed before her eyes

She knew there was more
Than what was right at her door
So she stepped out into the night

I say you don't look back
I say you don't look back now
And away it goes

She traveled alone
Keeping her thumb on the road
And remembering not to cry

Lost and found
Until a stranger slowed down
And she stepped in and took a ride

I say you don't look back
I say you don't look back now
And the engines go

I say you don't look back

Partners in crime
They were undress to their nines
And together they were at home

They say love is blind
And getting harder to find
So she jumped in and let it grow

Times like these you get a little down
Close your eyes and lets spin you, turn around
In all directions, in all directions
