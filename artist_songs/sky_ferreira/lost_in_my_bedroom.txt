You're crystal clear
Facing the light
Don't disappear
It's just what I imagined

So happy here
Everything's right
It's crystal clear
It's just what I imagined

Lost in my bed
And I'm lost in my head
And I'm lost in my bedroom again
It's just what I imagined
Lost in my bedroom
It's just what I imagined

It's just what I imagined
Lost in my bedroom
It's just what I imagined

Lost in my bed
And I'm lost in my head
And I'm lost in my bedroom again
It's just what I imagined
Lost in my bedroom
It's just what I imagined

It's just what I imagined
Lost in my bedroom
It's just what I imagined 

Suddenly strange
Everything's right
Inside my brain
It's just what I imagined

Something's not right
Shadows appear
I close my eyes
Is this real

Lost in my bed
And I'm lost in my head
And I'm lost in my bedroom again
It's just what I imagined
Lost in my bedroom
It's just what I imagined

It's just what I imagined
Lost in my bedroom
It's just what I imagined

Lost in my bed
And I'm lost in my head
And I'm lost in my bedroom again
It's just what I imagined
Lost in my bedroom
It's just what I imagined

It's just what I imagined
Lost in my bedroom
It's just what I imagined

It's just what I imagined
Lost in my bedroom
It's just what I imagined
