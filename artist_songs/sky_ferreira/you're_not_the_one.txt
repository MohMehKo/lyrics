Dreams stay with you
Always on my mind, I've got a lust for life
Seasons bring truth
When I found mine, it was summertime

It's the middle of the night and I'm so gone
And I'm thinking about how much I need you but you really want somebody else
Should be given the right to carry on
I'm still thinking about how much I need you but you really want somebody else

You're not the one
Guess you're not the one

Streets like a zoo
Those city lights, love at first sight
Silent rays of blue
They slowly glide right down my spine

It's the middle of the night and I'm so gone
And I'm thinking about how much I need you but you really want somebody else
Should be given the right to carry on
I'm still thinking about how much I need you but you really want somebody else

You're not the one
Guess you're not the one
You're not the one
Guess you're not the one

I was enjoying the ride
But now we're standing on the grave sight
Left unsatisfied
I won't even bother to fight
I know...

You're not the one
You're not the one
You're not the one

You're not the one
Guess you're not the one
You're not the one
Guess you're not the one

You're not the one
