[Verse 1:]
Your face is sad
I've kissed your mouth,
Just a million times
About a million times
Only wish that you could see,
Together we'll be fine
Like your voice,
When it growls and hisses,
Oh, it's beautiful
Yeah, it's beautiful
Only wish that you could see,
Together we'll be fine

[Chorus:]
I like you,
You disappear inside a melting tomb
But I like you
We can howl at the moon

[Verse 2:]
You're a werewolf from waist down,
I'm in a different town
Just a different town
Only wish that you could see,
Together we'd be fine
Know a spell that I can use?
And all I feel is gloom
All I feel is gloom
Only wish that you could see,
Together we'd be free

[Chorus:]
And I like you,
You disappear inside a melting tomb
But I like you
We can howl at the moon

[Chorus:]
And I like you,
You disappear inside a melting tomb
But I like you
We can howl at the moon

[Outro:]
Don't repay me with abuse
