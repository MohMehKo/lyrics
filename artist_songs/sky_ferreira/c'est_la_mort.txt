Don't want to be sent to the back,
Don't tell me to relax.
Hate when people aren't polite,
They can't ever run on time.
Everyone has someone to blame.
Problem's that I'm not insane.
Never could get those straight-A's,
I kinda like how failure tastes.

Maybe if I lose some weight,
I could date someone rich.
Maybe if I don't sin,
I could start living on such name.

No fun, no fun,
No fun for us.
No fun for us.
No fun for us.
Uh, oh-oh.
C'est la vie.
Uh, oh-oh.
C'est la vie.
Let's run, let's run,
Let's run, let's run,
Let's run away.
Let's run away.
Uh, oh-oh.
C'est la vie.
Uh, oh-oh.
C'est la vie.

Don't tell me what to think,
Don't tell me when I should wake.
Getting up at six is crazy,
So you wanna call me lazy.
Mom and dad think I'm a fool,
Only for those of you,
I'll take a few hits after school,
And realize how much he drools.

Maybe if I lose some weight,
I could date someone rich.
Maybe if I don't sin,
I could start thinking straight.

No fun, no fun,
No fun for us.
No fun for us.
No fun for us.
Uh, oh-oh.
C'est la vie.
Uh, oh-oh.
C'est la vie.
Let's run, let's run,
Let's run, let's run,
Let's run away.
Let's run away.
Uh, oh-oh.
C'est la vie.
Uh, oh-oh.
Let's run away.

C'est la vie,
Can't you see?
It's all right,
All right with me.
C'est la vie,
C'est la vie.
Go-oh.
C'est la vie.
I'm not opaque,
I'm not okay,
C'est la vie,
Just go away.
Go away,
C'est la vie.
Go away,
C'est la vie.

No fun, no fun,
No fun for us.
No fun for us.
No fun for us.
Uh, oh-oh.
C'est la vie.
Uh, oh-oh.
C'est la vie.
Let's run, let's run,
Let's run, let's run,
Let's run away.
Let's run away.
Uh, oh-oh.
C'est la vie.
Uh, oh-oh.
C'est la vie.

Uh, oh-oh.
C'est la vie.
