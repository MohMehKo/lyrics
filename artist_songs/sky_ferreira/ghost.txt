I'm not irrational, I'm just no longer in the daydream
Of the delusion that once was held between our seams
Lately, I'm in-between being steady or a head case
What's become of us now? Hanging our hearts in disgrace

[Chorus:]
What did I do to make you so cruel?
I've got this ache inside my heart, I know that it's you
What should I do now that I know that we're doomed?
I loved you most
And now you're a ghost I walk right through

Oh, remember when you said that I was sick inside the head?
I'm just half way there, my common sense hanging by a thread
A man on the outside, but a coward at heart
The taste of salt in my mouth
My voice is silent, but my thoughts are loud

[Chorus x2:]
What did I do to make you so cruel?
I've got this ache inside my heart, I know that it's you
What should I do now that I know that we're doomed?
I loved you most
And now you're a ghost I walk right through
