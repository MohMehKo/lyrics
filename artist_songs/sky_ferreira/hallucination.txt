I've been chasing rainbows all my life,
Comical delusions by my side.
But I never thought I'd have such a perfect dream.
Uh-oh, uh-oh.
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

There is a chimera in my brain,
Drinking up my thoughts like cheap campaign.
But I wasn't sure I'd see you again.

Uh-oh, uh-oh.
A hallucination.
Uh-oh.
Dream on, dream on,
You're not real.
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

See their faces melting in the snow,
Waving at old lovers as they go.
Disappear with everything you've known.

Uh-oh, uh-oh,
Uh-oh, uh-oh,
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh, uh-oh.
A hallucination.
Uh-oh
Dream on, dream on,
You're not real.
Uh-oh, uh-oh.
