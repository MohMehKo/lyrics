Are you ready to sky dive?
A little walk on the wild side
Take a look at the world from ten thousand feet
And the pulse of your heart starts to skip a beat

Think you're ready to sky dive? (I'll tie you up)
The devil in disguise (can't get enough)
Free-falling, we tumble into the sea
Close call and you're climbing all over me

All over me
All over you
What can you lose?

We've got no time for granted
Our parachute is landing
You shot your cannon then
I died and went to heaven

Tame me like a tiger
I wanna jump through fire
I have no fear when I'm walking on the wire

On the wire
On the wire

I wanna ride like a stallion
My royal army battalion
Hanging off of the edge, I'm invincible
Taking over the world like I'm ten feet tall

Sweet shot of adrenaline (I like the rush)
I wanna feel you like that again (can't get enough)
Deep down and you fall into my abyss
That high on the rope that you never miss

Don't miss the time
Don't miss the moon
What can you lose?

We've got no time for granted
Our parachute is landing
You shot your cannon then
I died and went to heaven

Tame me like a tiger
I wanna jump through fire
I have no fear when I'm walking on the wire

We've got no time for granted
Our parachute is landing
You shot your cannon then
I died and went to heaven

Tame me like a tiger
I wanna jump through fire
I have no fear when I'm walking on the wire

We've got no time for granted
Our parachute is landing
You shot your cannon then
I died and went to heaven

Tame me like a tiger
I wanna jump through fire
I have no fear when I'm walking on the wire

We've got no time for granted
Our parachute is landing
You shot your cannon then
I died and went to heaven

Tame me like a tiger
I wanna jump through fire
I have no fear when I'm walking on the wire

On the wire
On the wire
