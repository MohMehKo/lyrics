Never thought I'd have a moment like this
All I want to feel is your kiss
So many words on the tip of my tongue
So many things that you should have done

Right now it hurts that I want you to stay
Nobody asked me if I was okay
In six seconds I count 10 reasons to go
Every day people tell me something else that I know

Yeah, nobody asked me what I wanted
Nobody asked me

I tried to ask you but nobody asked me
I tried to ask you but nobody asked me
If I was okay
Nobody asked me, nobody asked me
If I was okay
Nobody asked me

Nobody asked me if I was okay
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Nobody asked if I was okay

Shaking your head while I try to explain
You say you don't want to hear me complain
Just trying to get my point across
You don't seem to care if I'm feeling lost

Right now it hurts that I want you to stay
I can't understand why I feel this way
All the friends I've ever had tell me go
Every day I hear them saying something else that I know

Yeah, nobody asked me what I wanted
Nobody asked me

I tried to ask you but nobody asked me
I tried to ask you but nobody asked me
If I was okay
Nobody asked me, nobody asked me
If I was okay
Nobody asked me

Nobody asked me if I was okay
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Nobody asked if I was okay

I hear a siren guiding me closer
I hear it's echo over and over
I tried to ask you
I tried to ask you
I tried to ask but nobody asked

I tried to ask you but nobody asked me
I tried to ask you but nobody asked me
If I was okay
Nobody asked me, nobody asked me
If I was okay
Nobody asked me

Nobody asked me if I was okay
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Nobody asked if I was okay

Nobody asked me if I was okay
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Nobody asked if I was okay
