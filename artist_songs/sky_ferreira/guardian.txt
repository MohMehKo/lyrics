I always thought I needed a guardian
And now that I’ve got one, I wanna be free
I don’t wanna live my life unhappily
I’m locked up in chains, laid out on the floor
I’ve been told the story end
I’m not gonna cry, I’m not gonna be
No matter how hard it might be

I wanna be free from the dark that is deep inside of me
free from the eyes I see watching over me
Don’t want you to be there, don’t want you to care for me anymore
I wanna be free of the guardian, I am the guardian

The small town girl that I’m looking for
There’s nothing I’d like more
To feel like a child, somewhere within
Nothing there beneath the skin
Too tired to live, too tired to die
So I just stay high
I just wanna live and swallow the pill
Should I just keep trying?

I wanna be free from the dark that is deep inside of me,
free from all the eyes I see watching over me
Don’t want you to be there, don’t want you to care for me anymore
I wanna be free of the guardian, I am the guardian

I wanna be free from the dark that is deep inside of me,
free from all the eyes I see watching over me
Don’t want you to be there, don’t want you to care for me anymore
I wanna be free of the guardian, I am the guardian

I am the guardian
I am the guardian
I am the guardian
