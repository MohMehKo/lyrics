Un, deux, trois

Come on now, can you please turn the radio up?
Turn it on, make it loud cause it's ohhh oh

Hear the music, and lose my self control
Knock me over with your melody
Feel the music
Forget what I am told [x3]

(Et la musique, la musique [x2])
I can't stop the beat
I can't stop
[x4]

My L-O-L-I-T-A
(my Lolita)
There's nothing like this Lolita
(my Lolita)
You fall apart when I look at ya
(my Lolita)
My L-O-L-I-T-A

Pop pop when I'm droppin
Come on baby, drive me crazy
You're cute and I'm so bitchy
When I'm gone, you're gonna miss me
[x2]

Feel the music
Forget what I am told [x3]

(Et la musique, la musique [x2])
I can't stop the beat
I can't stop
[x4]

My L-O-L-I-T-A
(my Lolita)
There's nothing like this Lolita
(my Lolita)
You fall apart when I look at ya
(my Lolita)
My L-O-L-I-T-A

Ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh
You don't need another
Ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh
Come on and knock me over
Ohh ohh, ohh ohh, oh oh

My L-O-L-I-T-A
(my Lolita)
There's nothing like this Lolita
(my Lolita)
You fall apart when I look at ya
