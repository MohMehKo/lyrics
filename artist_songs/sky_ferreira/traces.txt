You were just a boy
With an appetite
Hate it when you leave stains in my bed
I know I should've read
All the warning signs
But I fell for all your white lies again

Nothing you do, no nothing you say
Is gonna take the damage away
Oh, nothing you do, no nothing you say
Is gonna take the bruises away

You've bit bit bitten off
You've bit bit bit bitten off
More than you can chew
I I'm getting rid of you
I I'm get get get getting rid of
Get get get getting rid of traces of
Traces, the traces, the traces of you

I was just a girl, in the fantasy
Dreamin that you would be good for me
But now I see your greed
Now that I bleed
This time I'm gonna go set you free

Nothing you do, no nothing you say
Is gonna take the damage away
Oh, nothing you do, no nothing you say
Is gonna take the bruises away

You've bit bit bitten off
You've bit bit bit bitten off
More than you can chew
I I'm getting rid of you
I I'm get get get getting rid of
Get get get getting rid of traces of
Traces, the traces, the traces of you

Ate my heart in every way,
Ate my heart in every way
Lockin the cage
Starin at you I'll stray
Can't get your way today

You've bit bit bitten off
You've bit bit bit bitten off
More than you can chew
I I'm getting rid of you
I I'm get get get getting rid of
Get get get getting rid of traces of
Traces, the traces, the traces of you
Get get get getting rid of
Get get get getting rid of traces of
Traces, the traces, the traces of you
Get get get getting rid of
Get get get getting rid of traces of
Traces, the traces, the traces of you
Get get get getting rid of
Get get get getting rid of traces of
Traces, the traces, the traces of you
