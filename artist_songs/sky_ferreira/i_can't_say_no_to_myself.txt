If I gave you a list of old lies
You would answer with only your eyes
No one listens, no one talks
To many times around the block
Let's put the message aside
Like a death note pulling at the end of the tide
There ain't no love in a sunrise check
Chains keeping us attached

When I dream I walk away
When I'm awake I'm afraid to say no

I can't say no to myself
(I can't say no)
And when it comes to somebody else
I've got a yes for you
(I know, I know, I know, I know)
I've got a yes for you
(I know, I know, I know, I know)
I can't say no

Everyday I reach for the floor
My body's loyal but my heart is a whore
I've forgotten how to be free
Leaving you means leaving me

When I dream I walk away
When I'm awake I'm afraid to say no

I can't say no to myself
(I can't say no)
And when it comes to somebody else
I've got a yes for you
(I know, I know, I know, I know)
I've got a yes for you
(I know, I know, I know, I know)
I can't say no

When I dream I walk away
When I'm awake I'm afraid to say no

I can't say no to myself
(I can't say no)
And when it comes to somebody else
I've got a yes for you
(I know, I know, I know, I know)
I've got a yes for you
(I know, I know, I know, I know)
I can't say no

I can't say no
I can't say no
(I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know)
I can't say no
I can't say no to myself
I can't say no to myself
