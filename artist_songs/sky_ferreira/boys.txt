[Spoken:]
I knew it was love

[Verse 1:]
Boys, they're dime a dozen
Boys, they doing nothing,
For me any longer
Not be getting stronger

Boys, a lot of women love you,
But boys they just make me mad
All the little things that you do,
Ain't gonna make me sad

Then I saw one looking,
At me from afar

[Chorus:]
Then I knew it was you all along,
I knew it was you all along
Suddenly I knew there was love,
Then I knew it was you all along
You put my faith back in boys
Back in,

[Verse 2:]
Boys, I see you smiling
Boys'll never take the blame
All the rotten things that you do,
Always getting in my way

Then I saw one looking,
At me from afar

[Chorus:]
Then I knew it was you all along,
I knew it was you all along
Suddenly I knew there was love,
Then I knew it was you all along
You put my faith back in boys
Back in,

[Bridge:]
Cross my heart and hope to die,
Stick a needle in my eye
Cross my heart and hope to die,
Stick a needle in my eye
I'll cross my heart and hope to die,
Stick a needle in my eye

[Chorus:]
Then I knew it was you all along,
I knew it was you all along
Suddenly I knew there was love,
I knew it was love
I knew,
I knew it was you
I knew,
I knew it was you
I knew

You put my faith back in boys
(I knew it was you)
(I knew)
Back in,
(I knew it was you)
(I knew)
Back in boys
(I knew it was you)
(I knew)
Back in,
(I knew it was love)
(I knew)
Back in boys
(I knew it was love)
(I knew)
Back in,

You put my faith back in boys
(I knew it was you)
(I knew)
Back in,
(I knew it was you)
(I knew)
Back in boys
(I knew it was you)
(I knew)
Back in,
(I knew it was love)
(I knew)
Back in boys
(I knew it was love)
(I knew)
Back in boys
