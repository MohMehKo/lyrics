Every time, I tell myself again that he just wants to be my friend
I can't keep up
He's locked inside my head
But he just wants to be my friend

It's always just stay
It's always just stay
Never just go
Never just go

It's always just stay
It's always just stay
Never just go
Never just go

We fell in love in stereo
Then he broke my heart in stereo
We fell in love in stereo
Then he broke my heart in stereo

When he picked me up
What was is his intent,
Just to let me down again?

I'll survive,
But how could I forget
All the things we did back then

It's always just stay
It's always just stay
Never just go
Never just go

It's always just stay
It's always just stay
Never just go
Never just go

We fell in love in stereo
Then he broke my heart in stereo
We fell in love in stereo
Then he broke my heart in stereo

In stereo [x6]

Every time, I tell myself again
I can't keep up
He's locked inside my head
When he picked me up
What was is his intent,
I'll survive,
But how could I forget

We fell in love in stereo
Then he broke my heart in stereo
We fell in love in stereo
Then he broke my heart in stereo

In stereo [x6]
