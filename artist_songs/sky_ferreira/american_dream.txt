I'm learning lessons from making mistakes
If I get burned no embers break
You told me I'm your destiny
Somehow your power gets the best of me.

Repeatedly I get neglected
You claim that I am unperfected
Now watch my frustration grow
And wonder why this girl let go

Do what you want, make me into your American Dream 
Say what you want, it's just another part of your mad machine
Make what you want, who can I blame? 
You're all the same 
Is it just me, sleeping with the enemy?

I've travelled 50 states of miserable
I walk on through the intolerable
Emotions blink, no landscapes change
A map between a rock and a dark place
I might be alright
I could be okay
I don't think I would try to throw it away-ay

Oh-h-h-h
Oh-h-h-h

Do what you want, make me into your American Dream 
Say what you want, it's just another part of your mad machine
Make what you want, who can I blame? 

You're all the same 
Is it just me, sleeping with the enemy?

If you prescribed anything
Numb reality and bring
Back to me those melodies
That you always take from me

Do what you want, make me into your American Dream 
Say what you want, it's just another part of your mad machine
Make what you want, who can I blame? 
You're all the same 
Is it just me, sleeping with the enemy?

Oh-h-h
Oh-h-h

Do what you want, want, want, want, want, want
Do what you want, want, want, want, want, want
Into your American Dream
Your American Dream, Dream, Dream

Do what you want, make me into your American Dream 
Say what you want, it's just another part of your mad machine
Make what you want, who can I blame? 
You're all the same 
Is it just me, sleeping with the enemy?
