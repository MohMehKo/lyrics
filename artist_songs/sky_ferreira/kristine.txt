I'm not feeling bad about it whatsoever
I'm happier near to the ground, so whatever
It's more a numbness than a bad or a great or a better
A giant comedy with museums and movies with 
Hedi, the routines of the young millionaires 

I will stand on the hill apolitical still in the name
of the young millionaires
Misanthropy, could it be in the name of the
father and the son and the young on the run with a ton?
Yeah, the young millionaires

Even though I'm not quite,
I've been living it right down
Pretending I am, what's the point of saving
Stabbin' pens in my hands, but I'm never workin', just spending
A giant comedy with museums and shopping with Kristine
The routines of the young millionaires

So, I will stand on the hill apolitical still in the name of the young millionaires
Misanthropy, could it be in the name of the
father and the son and the young on the run with a ton?
Yeah, the young millionaires

I will rave in support of the sports that we play
in the gyms of the young millionaires
I will brand all my bills with the badge that has
filled up the hands of the young millionaires

I'll shoot up the juice before making a truce with
not one in support of the young millionaires
Young millionaires
Young millionaires
