I can feel the heat of the light on my face
As I'm walkin' away from you
I can feel the beat of the night in my chest
I feel like I'm a galaxy away from you
Yeah I'm losing myself, talking to myself in the dark
When my body starts to work like a machine
I can feel the pulse of my heavy metal heart

You make my heavy metal heart beat beat oh
Oh yeah my heavy metal heart heart heart oh
Oh man you make me feel the pulse of my heavy metal heart
My heavy metal heart beat oh oh oh
Oh my heavy metal heart

I can see a vision that's meant to be mine
Slowly turnin' away from you
I can see it all standing on top of time
Yeah there's only one thing for me left to lose
I love losing myself, talking to myself in the dark
When my body starts to work like a machine
I can feel the pulse of my heavy metal heart

You make my heavy metal heart beat beat oh
Oh yeah my heavy metal heart heart heart oh
Oh man you make me feel the pulse of my heavy metal heart
My heavy metal heart beat oh oh oh
Oh my heavy metal heart

You turn my red to black
I'm never coming back
The way I was before
I'm not her anymore
Anymore
Anymore

You make my heavy metal heart beat
My heavy metal heart
Yeah my heavy metal heart beat
My heavy metal heart
Yeah my heavy metal heart
My heavy metal heart
Yeah my heavy metal heart
Yeah my heavy metal heart
My heavy metal heart
