Poured myself a warm glass, and laid awake
I prayed the lord my soul to take
I thought about you all day, how we have the same face
I fell asleep so confused, parts of me remind me of you
How could I ever wish away?

[Chorus:]
Only ever in dreams I wrap my arms around you.
And standing in the water with me,
I can tell you what I wanna tell you.
And I hope it's not just a bad dream,
Hope it's not just a sad dream

I wake up and I hear my phone ring,
I hear your call and I let my phone ring
When I got into my car and drove away,
I listened to the stereo play

I live by my own laws,
I stick to my guns and hold my head up to midnight sun
I hope the guilt will dim and fade,
The fire baptism engulfed in my shame

[Chorus: x2]
Only ever in dreams I wrap my arms around you.
And standing in the water with me,
I can tell you what I wanna tell you.
And I hope it's not just a bad dream,
Hope it's not just a sad dream
