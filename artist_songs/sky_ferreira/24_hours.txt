The seconds ran away, minutes passed
At speeds we can run at
As hours start to fade
Deep into the night
I'm not in the mood for laughing

It's slipping away
There's nothing we can do
It's slipping away
There is no tomorrow without you

I wish these 24 hours would never end
Oh, in these 24 hours
Wish the clock had no hand
For 24 hours
We still have time
For 24 hours
You're still mine

If this isn't real, just can't deal
In a way you could say, I was always a cynic
Hopeful for a while
Lost in denial
I wish this could last
Forever

It's slipping away
There's nothing we can do
It's slipping away
There is no tomorrow without you

I wish these 24 hours would never end
Oh, in these 24 hours
Wish the clock had no hand
For 24 hours
We still have time
For 24 hours
You're still mine

I wish these 24 hours would never end

I... I... I...

I won't settle on (x3)
'Cause in 24 hours (x2)
You'll be gone (x3)
In 24 hours

In 24 hours
We still have time
For 24 hours
You're still mine

I wish these 24 hours would never end
Oh, in these 24 hours wish the clock had no hand...
