You're just another bad,
You're just another bad,
You're just another bad,
Hit, hit, hit
You're just another bad,
You're just another bad
My turn now, can you handle it?

Stop tripping, keep wishing that you could be me
Stop commenting and checking my location link
Stop blogging, stop blabbing bout everything
Name dropping and hating every girl that you see
What you say now, s-s-s-say
No one, really cares what it is either way, shut up!
G-g-g-go, d-don't let the door hit cha,
You're on the floor cause you're f-f-f-f-
Fucked up!

You're just another bad,
You're just another bad,
You're just another bad,
Hit, hit, hit
You're just another bad,
You're just another bad,
You're just another bad,
Hit, hit, hit

Stop bragging, stop tagging me on your FB
Stop spreading all those rumors like your STD
Stop lurking, Google searching all alerts on me.
It costs a lot of money just to look this cheap

Whatcha tweeting now? d-d-delete his site
You're not so tough when we're face to face 
And now, g-g-g-go, d-don't let the door hit cha
Me and my girls, g-g-girls, are gonna split cha

You're just another bad,
You're just another bad,
You're just another bad,
Hit, hit, hit
You're just another bad,
You're just another bad,
You're just another bad, 
Hit, hit, hit

I'm one of a kind, wanna make a bet?
You're one of the millions on Chatroulette
Better edit all the things you said
Your social light is dim and dead
I'm working for all the things I got,
I'm everything that you are not
