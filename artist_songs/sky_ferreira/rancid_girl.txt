Rancid skin, rancid blouse
Filthy mouth, Minnie Mouse
She tells the young woman's dream
From the hole where God threw her teeth

The last rancid girl
In a rancid world
And I don't seem
Seem to mind

Hang around with yourself
Claim you belong to someone else
With your pipe in your hand
The future is so uncertain

The last rancid girl
In a rancid world
And I don't seem
Seem to mind

Deadly eyes, vacant face
Always damned with fake praise
Wandering to hell and back
Knees and arms dressed in scabs

Keep your pipe on yourself
Just claim it belongs to someone else

The last rancid girl
In a rancid world
And I don't seem
Seem to mind
