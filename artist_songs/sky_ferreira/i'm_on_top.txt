You never met your match you said,
In anyone of the opposite sex.
Anyone who shared your bed was a little less.
You like to be on top you said.
What you got wasn’t what you wanted.
Always worried you were getting less,
Than what others get.

Look at me now,
Eat your heart out.
I’m the cherry sitting on the top,
To look at you now, looking so small.
You’d never know that you had walked so tall.
Now you’re quite forgotten,
Rotting at the bottom,
And I’m on top.
I’m on top.
I’m on top.

You’re always in control you said,
You’re operating at a higher level,
Than all your lovers did.
Well, isn’t that what you said?
You never felt you ever loved,
You only felt you were playing a part,
And so you loved her less,
And got yourself in debt.

Look at me now,
Eat your heart out.
I’m the cherry sitting on the top,
To look at you now, looking so small.
You’d never know that you had walked so tall.
Now you’re quite forgotten,
Rotting at the bottom,
And I’m on top.
I’m on top.
I’m on top.
