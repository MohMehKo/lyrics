[Verse 1:]
I'm useless and I know it
Auditory hallucination
You said, "I don't care what I'm thinking about,
But I'm thinking of you right now"

[Chorus:]
Night time is my time
I'm drowning not waving
Falling in space
Will I slow down?
Or go faster and faster
Into you maybe?
Slow down right now

[Verse 2:]
I wouldn't feel anything
When we burst into dust forever
And no angels will help us out
'Cause they've all gone away

[Chorus:]
Night time is my time
I'm drowning not waving
Falling in space
Will I slow down?
Or go faster and faster
Into you maybe?
Slow down right now

Faster and faster
I'm going faster and faster
I'm going faster and faster
I'm going faster and faster
I'm going faster and faster
I'm going faster and faster
Faster and faster and faster...
