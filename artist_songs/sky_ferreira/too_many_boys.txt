Boys, I love 'em
They come a dime a dozen
Boys, I leave 'em
They come and go like seasons
I don't trust 'em, I don't need a reason
Won't bother fussin'
Some even catch me teasin'

I saw one looking at me from afar
Then one with good looks and had glasses on
Then one in hot fashion that's worth a ton
I think I'll add them to my collection

Too many boys at the party that I like
It aggravates my A.D.D.
I came with him
But I'm leavin' with someone else
Too many boys I kiss goodbye, can't control that
No matter how hard I try
I came with him
But I'm leavin' with someone else

And in my head I'm singing
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la
I'm leavin' with someone else

Boys, don't judge me
'Cause I let them love me
Girls, they hate me
'Cause they don't like what they see
It's unfair, but how can you blame me?
No point of even trying to change me

I saw one looking at me from afar
Then one with good looks and had glasses on
Then one in hot fashion that's worth a ton
I think I'll add them to my collection

Too many boys at the party that I like
It aggravates my A.D.D.
I came with him
But I'm leavin' with someone else
Too many boys I kiss goodbye, can't control that
No matter how hard I try
I came with him
But I'm leavin' with someone else

And in my head I'm singing
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la
I'm leavin' with someone else

Now I changed my tone into a mission
Gotta have what I want, did I mention?
Better pay me a lot more attention tonight
Tonight

Too many boys at the party that I like
It aggravates my A.D.D.
I came with him
But I'm leavin' with someone else
Too many boys I kiss goodbye, can't control that
No matter how hard I try
I came with him
But I'm leavin' with someone else

And in my head I'm singing
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la
I'm leavin' with someone else
