I gave you all of my body 
My heart, my soul, and my money 
I figured that you might be 
My one and only 
Rumors of cheating and lying 
Leaving me begging and crying 
Thirty two days, not a word to say 

Don't you know that 
I think I've had enough now 
Karma karma 
It will pay you back 
Don't you think that 
You'll be missing me 
If I go, where will I go?

Turn around 
It's my turn to let you down 
I love it when you 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
Turn around 
It's my turn to let you down 
You can drown in 99 tears 

Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
(You're such a) 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
(You're such a) 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
You can drown in 99 tears 

Everyday you kept me waiting 
While you were only betraying 
Hoping that I never learn 
The games you were playing 
Now you wanna call me (call me) 
Only 'cause you're very lonely 
Baby, look who's crying now 
You're the joke 

Don't you know that 
I think I've had enough now 
Karma karma 
It will pay you back 
Don't you think that 
You'll be missing me 
If I go, where will I go 

Turn around 
It's my turn to let you down 
I love it when you 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
Turn around 
It's my turn to let you down 
You can drown in 99 tears 

Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
(You're such a) 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
(You're such a) 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
You can drown in 99 tears 

Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 

You all know 
How it feels to be me 
When your heart's on the floor 
And your dreams are all gone 

Turn around 
It's my turn to let you down 
I love it when you 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
Turn around 
It's my turn to let you down 
You can drown in 99 tears 

Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
(You're such a) 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
(You're such a) 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
Cry baby, cry baby, cry 
You can drown in 99 tears
