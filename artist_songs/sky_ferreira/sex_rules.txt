We are animals 
No matter what we deny 
Our bodies strong like magnets 
In the darkening sky 

It's a complicated blend of tenderness and aggression 
Whatever gets you off, whatever your obsession 

Sex rules 
Use your God-given tools 
Sex rules 
I pity the fools 
Who realize too late 
Love, sex, and God are great 
Oh-oh oh-oh 
Sex rules 

I want you to love me 
Baby, to love me right 
But I'm kinda shy at telling you 
To tell you what I like 

It's a complicated blend of tenderness and aggression 
That's what gets me off, that is my obsession 

Sex rules 
Use your God-given tools 
Sex rules 
I pity the fools 
Who realize too late 
Love, sex, and God are great 
Oh-oh oh-oh 
Sex rules 

Why do we like what like? 
Why do we crave what we crave? 
Why do some need to be masters? 
Why do some need to be slaves? 

Sex rules 
Use your God-given tools 
Sex rules 
I pity the fools 
Who realize too late 
Love, sex, and God are great 
Oh-oh oh-oh 
Sex rules
