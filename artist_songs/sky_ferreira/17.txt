She, she, she, 
She came home late again tonight, 
You could see it in her eyes, 
She's been up to something.
Oh, whoa, we, we, we, 
Don't know what to do with her, 
She's from a different world, 
And it's apparent now this girl is hiding, 
Something in the way she gives a confident excuse, 
There's no way they'd ever know shes been -

Sneaking out at night, 
She's dancing at the night club, 
Yeah, she got a fake ID,
They'll never know she's 17.
Oh, and she's drinking with her friends,
And they're all 21,
I wonder how much longer she can get away with -
Her dirty little secret.

Ba, ba, ba, di, da, da, da, da, da 
Ba, ba, ba, di, da, da, da, da, da 

Mom and dad, 
They don't seem to understand,
She's got so many older friends, 
They pick her up every Wednesday night. 
She breaks the rules, 
She makes a fool of everyone, 
She won't give up until she's done,
And it's apparent now this girl is missing,
Something in the way she gives a confident excuse, 

There's no way they'd ever know shes been -

Sneaking out at night, 
She's dancing at the night club, 
Yeah, she got a fake ID,
They'll never know she's 17.
Oh, and she's drinking with her friends,
And they're all 21,
I wonder how much longer she can get away with -
Her dirty little secret.

She hides the pain behind the fun,
She said she doesn't need anyone at all,
They say she's living way too fast, 
I wonder how long she can last before she falls -
To the ground. 

Something in the way she pushes everyone away,
There's no way they'd ever know -

Sneaking out at night, 
She's dancing at the night club, 
Yeah, she got a fake ID,
They'll never know she's 17.
Oh, and she's drinking with her friends,
And they're all 21,
I wonder how much longer she can get away with -
Her dirty little secret.
