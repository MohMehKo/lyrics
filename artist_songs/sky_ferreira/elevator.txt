I got you dizzy, heading for a collision
I'm so electric, I got you on a mission
I bat my eyes and get you hot just like a satellite
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Don't do much, I'll have you callin' me baby
It's such a rush cause I know I drive you crazy
I've got exactly what it takes to keep you satisfied
I can be your dream tonight

I'm striking like lightning
You callin' my bluff
You should try me (oh oh oh) 
Want you to come into my Elevator (oh oh oh)
And if you're lucky you can hit me later

Systematic, 
Love fanatic
It's like oh oh oh
Problematic
So erotic
It's like oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
You can come into my Elevator (oh oh oh)
And if you're lucky you can hit me later (oh oh oh)

Yeah, just one touch and now I got you sedated
You're stuck inside the fantasy I've created
Now my Elevator's got you goin' up and down
Ah, ah, ah
Don't be surprised if I play with your emotions
It's just a habit baby don't get your hopes up
I got a temporary crush on you, so I'm gonna let you in
Baby let's begin Oh-whoa

I'm striking like lightning
You callin' my bluff
You should try me (oh oh oh) 
Want you to come into my Elevator (oh oh oh)
And if you're lucky you can hit me later

It's like oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
You can come into my Elevator (oh oh oh)
And if you're lucky you can hit me later (Oh oh oh)

Just because we're having fun
Doesn't mean that you're the only one
You're just a chapter in my story
Let's write another page
Cause you know either way
I'm striking like lightning!

I'm striking like lightning
You callin' my bluff
