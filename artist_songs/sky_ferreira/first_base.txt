We'll go first base and whip the doctor
We're gonna get high knock you off you rocker
Staying up all night
Alright, alright, alright, alright

It's getting late
I can't wait
I can't wait
To see if you glow
In the dark
In the dark
If sparks fly like fireflies
When I look into your eyes

We'll go first base and whip the doctor
We're gonna get high knock you off you rocker
Staying up all night
Alright, alright, alright, alright

I'll play tricks, can you feel the magic?
You've never had a ride that's so fantastic
Staying up all night
Alright, alright, alright, alright

We're worlds apart
Yes we are
Yes we are
But when you're near
It's just your words
I can hear
And sparks fly like firelights
When I look into your eyes

We'll go first base and whip the doctor
We're gonna get high knock you off you rocker
Staying up all night
Alright, alright, alright, alright

I'll play tricks, can you feel the magic?
You've never had a ride that's so fantastic
Staying up all night
Alright, alright, alright, alright

The way I show
You that I know
So what? It's fine
Don't be too shy
Nowhere to go
The light so low
So what? It's fine
Don't you know that this time it gonna be alright?

We'll go first base and whip the doctor
We're gonna get high knock you off you rocker
Staying up all night
Alright, alright, alright, alright

I'll play tricks, can you feel the magic?
You've never had a ride that's so fantastic
Staying up all night
Alright, alright, alright, alright
