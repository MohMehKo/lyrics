Touch and go, touch and go
Touch and go, touch and go

I've, been waiting on the side, on the borderline
Uh-uh-oh, why? 
You're wasting all your time, thinking that you're mine

Now boy, this ain't no game so don't treat me like a hoe
You're the reason why a girl like me just wants to touch and go
You think you know me? 
Don't get too cozy saying oh way oh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, oh way oh

I'm running round the world dropping high and low
Didn't mean to turn you on so don't get too close
Will we ever meet again? I don't know
Why don't we just touch and go? T-t-t-t-t-touch and go

You, you have it on your mind, almost all the time, oh oh
It takes two, you got a lot to prove
So come on make a move

Now boy, you're just so late
Yeah, you move too slow
You're the reason why a girl like me just wants to touch and go
You think you know me?
Don't get too cozy saying oh way oh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, oh oh way oh

I'm running round the world dropping high and low
Didn't mean to turn you on so don't get too close
Will we ever meet again? I don't know
Why don't we just touch and go? Why don't we just touch and go? 

Touch and go, touch and go
Now boy, this ain't no game so don't treat me like a hoe
You're the reason why a girl like me just wants to touch and go

I'm running round the world dropping high and low
Didn't mean to turn you on so don't get too close
Will we ever meet again? I don't know
Why don't we just touch and go? Why don't we just touch and go?

Touch and go, turn on
Will we ever meet again? I don't know
Why don't we just touch and go? Why don't we just touch and go? 
Touch and go
