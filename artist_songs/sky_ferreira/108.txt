Got a clever disguise
The devil wouldn't even recognize
That's why I got the electric eye
Never ever compromised

I got an ancient pain
I lost my wings and fell to earth
And then I wouldn't stay in my golden cage
So I gave up everything

What I'm about to say is gonna sound strange
So, so strange

My secret lover is 108
I know it sounds insane
It's really okay
He's got a face to haunt you 
For a billion decades
My secret lover is a 108

I got a broken brain
The doctor's saying that I'm overpaid
I'm seeking someone to take the blame
Like that would solve anything

Got a word of advice
Don't ever listen to the old and wise
You know they lie 'cause they move their mouth
Teaching their wrong and right

What I'm about to say is gonna sound strange
So, so strange

My secret lover is a 108
I know it sounds insane
It's really okay
He's got a face to haunt you for a billion decades
My secret lover is a 108
