Burn the house to the ground
We make a dynamite sound
Pulverize, decimate
This is the dynamite state

Light the fuse, you can't lose
We're breaking all the taboos
Burn the house to the ground
We make a dynamite sound 

And we will light your strike
And we will light your strike

I’m a firecracker, feel the blitz
Just how I sparkle, put it on the ritz
Watch you shake to my earthquake
C’mon boys and girls
Let’s blow up the world
C’mon boys and girls
Let’s blow up the world
We're dynamite, we're dynamite
We're dynamite, we're dynamite
We're nuclear, we're shoot to kill
We're for the win, so let's begin
We're dynamite, so let's ignite
We've got the fight, let's make a thrill
In for the kill, we're dynamite
We're dynamite, we're dynamite

La, la, la; la, la, la
La; la, la, la, la, la

Misfits can stick around,
You're on the wrong side of town
It's too late, choose your fate
We're in the dynamite state

And we will light your strike
And we will light your strike

I’m a firecracker, feel the blitz
Just how I sparkle, put it on the ritz
Watch you shake, to my earthquake
C’mon boys and girls
Let’s blow up the world
C’mon boys and girls
Let’s blow up the world
We're dynamite, we're dynamite
We're dynamite, we're dynamite
We're nuclear, we're shoot to kill
We're for the win, so let's begin
We're dynamite, so let's ignite
We've got the fight, let's make a thrill
In for the kill, we're dynamite
We're dynamite, we're dynamite
