Red lips
You're ten a penny, cheap shot
Spreading your legs for the boys
Watch out
'Cause someone will beat you the same
Freak out

Mmmmmmmm
Wash out your mouth

Such a big girl
Such big news
Such a big talk
Your number is up, if you like it or not
What a shock

Little bitch
Growing so bored of your fits
'Cause sooner or later, you're done
And down with the worms
And no one remembers your name
Too bad

Mmmmmmmm
Such an inconsequence

Such a big girl
Such big news
Such a big talk

Your number is up
If you like it or not
Your number is up
If you like it or not
Your number is up
If you like it or not

Such a big girl
Such big news
Such a big talk

Your number is up
If you like it or not
Your number is up
If you like it or not
What a shock
