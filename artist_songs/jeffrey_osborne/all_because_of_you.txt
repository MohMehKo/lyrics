I was sitting up above the clouds
Then one day you just came soaring by
Foolish me, I hopped on for a ride
Oh, why?

Then my life just took sudden turn
It's hard to swallow but you live and learn
I never felt the pain so deep, that burn
So long

All because of you
You turned me inside out
You reached inside and shook my soul
All because of you
I can't get off the ground
I was doing fine and then came you
Then came you

I guess I should have looked before I leap
Before I knew it I was in too deep
With a, I felt with someone who would play for keep
With my heart

Felt as though the sun may never shine
At least for me not for a long, long time
You made me so ashamed to think that I
Was so blind

All because of you
You turned me inside out
You reached inside and shook my soul
All because of you
Hey, I can't get off the ground
I was doing fine and then came you
Then came you, oh

Yeah-yeah, baby
I was doing fine and then came you

All because of you
You turned me inside out
You reached inside and shook my soul
All because of you, baby
Hey, I can't get off the ground
I was doing fine and then came you

All because of you
You turned me inside out
All because of you
I can't get off the ground
I was doing fine and then came you

All because of you
You turned me inside out

All because of you
