Love is everything
That you are to me
Your reflection shows a glimpse of heaven
Love is all around
When you're here with me
Stay around
Love me
Love me never
Never

I know the sun was made to brighten up the days
The moon was made to light the night
And then baby they made you
Oh so beautiful
So they sprinkle you with sugar and some spice
Cause you were made to love

Your love made me change
In so many ways
Changes that were so much for the better
Made me want to live
Through the trying days
Just to have your love that's all that matters

Oh
I'm living for you

I know they made the bees to pollinate the flowers
The moon was made to bare the fruit of life
But when baby they made you
Oh so beautiful
So they sprinkled you with sugar and some spice
Cause you, you
You were made to love
And I love you
You oh ooohhh
