[Verse 1:]
I'm in love with you
I know you feel exactly like I do
Why don't we plans our futures (now)
We have been so blessed
And we could share a life of happiness
If you would just say, yes

[Chorus:]
Would you take my hand and say 'I do"
I willl promise to take care of you
And together we will hope-fullly
Be in love for the Rest of our Lives, oohh

[Verse 2:]
And when the time arrives,
I'l be standing firmly at your side
Until the day I die
My love,
When we take our vows
Our families and friends will be so proud
As tears our joy come tumbling down

[Chorus:]
Would you take my hand and say "I do"
I will promise to take care of you
And together we will hope-fully
Be in love for the Rest of Our Lives

[Verse 3:]
OOOh
A Blessed Day
Or will always be great from this moment on
We'll take that kiss
That kiss that turns two hearts into one
And with my ring upon your finger
Shinning so bright,
We both will smile walk down the isle
Husband and wife

[Chorus:]
Would you take my hand and say "I do"
I will promise to take care of you
And together we will hope-fully
Be in love for the Rest of Our Lives
