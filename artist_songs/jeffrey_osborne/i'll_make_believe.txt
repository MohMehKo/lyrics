I thought that time was on our side
Oh why did it slip away
I thought two hearts like yours and mine
Combine would be so hard to separate
But you go move on
So I pretend nothings change
Bring back yesterday

I make believe we never lost the magic
I make believe our love is still alive
I make believe what use to be is somewhere deep inside
I make believe it never really happened
I make believe you never said goodbye
I make believe the future still belongs to you and I

If love is hiding in your heart
Then now don't you leave me in the dark
Cause now my nights are long and cold
Hold on since you left me here alone
So I'll breathe its ok with me
Back together again but baby until then

I make believe we never lost the magic
I make believe our love is still alive
I make believe what use to be is somewhere deep inside
I make believe it never really happened
I make believe you never said goodbye
I make believe the future still belongs to you and I

Oh stars use to shine
Like the glow in your angel eyes
When our passion burns sweet in the night
You never knew who much I miss
The softness of your tender kiss
But for now I guess I'll go on dreaming

I make believe we never lost the magic
I make believe our love is still alive
I make believe what use to be is somewhere deep inside
I make believe it never really happened
I make believe you never said goodbye
I make believe the future still belongs to you and I

I make believe we never lost the magic
I make believe our love is still alive
I make believe what use to be is somewhere deep inside
I make believe it never really happened
I make believe you never said goodbye
I make believe the future still belongs to you and I

Make believe our love is still alive
I'll make believe the future still belongs to you and I
