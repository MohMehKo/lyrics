Feeling your breath in your silent sleep
Rehearsing words I never thought I'd say
I would give anything to know... Read More
If all I'm feeling now
Will disappear or will it stay

But if tomorrow never comes
I had the love we've made tonight
Now in my heart I knew how good a love can be
For there's one more with all my life
I had one night when love was right
And I hold on to it
If tomorrow never comes

I never dreamed, I'd be the one to change
Look at me completely swept away
Now I'm afraid to be without you

If I should lose this ever
How could I ever be the same

But if tomorrow never comes
I have the love we've made tonight
Now in my heart I knew how good a love can be
For there's one more with all my life
I had one night when love was right
And I hold on to it
If tomorrow never comes

You are the one that I've been waiting for
Kiss me to say forever
Hold me this way forever
