I think I finally know you,
I can see beyond your smile.
I think that I can show you
That we've had is still worthwhile.
Don't you know that love is just like a thread
That keeps unraveling but then
It ties us back together in the end?

In your eyes, I can see my dream's reflections.
In your eyes, I found the answers to my questions.
In your eyes,
I can see the reasons why our love's alive...
In your eyes,
We're drifting safely back to shore,
And I think I've finally learned to love you more...

And she warns me that life changes,
And that no one really knows
Whether time would make us strangers
Or whether time would make us grow.
Even though the winds of time will change
To a world where nothing stays the same,
Through it all our love will still remain...

In your eyes,
I can see the reasons why our love's alive...
You and I,
We're driftin' safely back to shore...
I think I've finally learned to love you more...
