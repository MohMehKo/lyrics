We're just beginning
And I know we've each been down this road a time or two
And never could make it through
But I've got this feelin'
That we've stumbled in to what we've both been waiting for
And maybe even more
It doesn't matter where we've been 'cause this time I know for sure

We're goin' all the way (All the way)
Headed for forever and that's where we're gonna stay
The more you're near me, the more I know it
We got it all here if we just don't blow it

We're goin' all the way (All the way)
If the two of us both want it I'd lay my money on it
Startin' today (Starting today)
We're goin' all the way

I know for certain
That there's more than magic in these feelings that we found
We're standin' on solid ground
But now we're both ready
Ready for the real thing 'cause our dues have all been paid
We've finally got it made
Believe me when I tell you there's no need to be afraid

We're goin' all the way (All the way)
We're headed for forever and that's where we're gonna stay
The more you're near me, the more I know it
We got it all here if we just don't blow it

We're goin' all the way (All the way)
If the two of us both want it I'd lay my money on it
Startin' today (Starting today)
We're goin' all the way

We're gonna weather all the showers
And hold together through whatever comes
I know we got the staying power
We're gonna make tomorrow ours
If we just stick with it
And give it all we've got to give it

We're goin' all the way (All the way)
If the two of us both want it I'd lay my money on it
Startin' today (Starting today)
We're goin' all the way, mmm... hmm...

Oh... oh... baby, we're goin' all the way (All the way)
If the two of us both want it I'd lay my money on it
Startin' today (Starting today)
We're goin' all the way, mmm... mmm... hmm... hmm... ooh... hoo...
