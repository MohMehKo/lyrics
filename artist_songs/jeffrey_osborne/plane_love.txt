I was living with a heartbreak
Trying to make it with a dreamer
Couldn't tell if it was too late
Crying every time I seen her
Then I met another a lady on the plane to California
When we landed it was raining
Told my baby let me warm 

Ohh, Plane Love was all
I needed to fall
Plane Love was there
With someone to share

I Didn't really want to get up
Didn't really want to leave town
Didn't want to go LA
Nothing waiting but a come down
Now I'm talking to an angel
Looking at a real lady
It doesn't feel like a stranger
Like she's always been my baby

Ohh, Plane Love was all
I needed to fall
Plane Love was there
With someone to share

I saw that feeling in her eyes
The kind you never want to hide
We searched for love in different ways
This time I think it's gonna pay

Oohh Plane Love was all
All I really needed to fall

Ohh, Could it really be the magic
Could it really be the feeling
Could I really be mistaken
Am I standing on this feeling
I been out of luck forever
Then I never rolled a seven
Then someone pull the lever
And I ended up in Heaaaven Yea

Whoa Ohh Plane Love was all
I needed to fall
Plane was there
With someone to share

Ohh Plane Love was all
I needed to fall
Plane was there
With someone to share

Met a pretty lady on a plane

oooohhh ohh

Now my life has never been the same

no no no

Ohh Plane Love was all
I needed oooooh

Met a little pretty lady on a plane

Oooohhh
