Why must she come and possess me in the heat of the night
Toss me and turn me then disappear
Here on the edge of obsession, I turn off all the lights
And pray that this fantasy can be real

Night and day I want to kiss her lips
And caress her like a man should do
She's become the center of my emotions
And I can't fight through

She's on the left, she's on the right, she's in the middle of my mind
She's on the left, she's on the right, she's in the middle of my mind

I, I can almost taste her and smell the scent of her perfume
I wish she were here for me to lay next to
She's so very close, but like every illusion that's just how it appears
And you reach out to touch and find there's no one there

Right now I'm gonna close my eyes
And go back to where I need to be
Maybe then I'll get to hear her say
That she loves me and she'll never leave

She's on the left, she's on the right, she's in the middle of my mind
Oh, she's on the left, she's on the right, she's in the middle of my mind
Oh, she's on the left, she's on the right, she's in the middle of my mind
She's on the left, she's on the right, actin' in the middle of my mind

Night and day I want to kiss her lips
And caress her like a man should do
She's become the center of my emotions
And I can't fight through

Ohh, baby

Oh, she's on the left, she's on the right, she's in the middle of my mind
Oh, she's on the left, she's on the right
Is actin' in the middle of my mind
Hey, she's on the left, she's on the right, she's on the middle of my mind
Oh, she's on the left, she's on the right
She's in the middle of my, of my, of my, of my mind

Girl's in the middle of my mind, she's like in the middle of my mind
She's on the left, she's on the right
The girl's on the right, the girl's in the middle of my mind
