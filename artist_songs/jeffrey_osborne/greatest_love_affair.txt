We've seen the brokenhearted
New loves started and then fade away
Where love ran out of energy
Somewhere along the way
Oh but lady the lessons we have learned
Have helped us make it
The mountains we have climbed
Are far behind

[Chorus:]
It's been a life Long love song
With every lyric saying that
We're still number one
And now composed our love has grown
And we have turned a prayer into
The greatest love affair of them all

And now we both should cherish
The treasures at the rainbow's end
The game is finally over
I knew that we would win
Oh and lady the lessons we have learned
Have helped us make it
The mountains we have climbed
Are far behind

[Chorus]

From now on it will be easy
So easy for you and I
We've found the purpose and the
Reason
The need lives on inside

[Chorus]
