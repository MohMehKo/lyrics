When you want all the warmth that you deserve
And the heat is on your mind
Don't you even think about it
I'll be there just wrapped around you
I can't hold back what I feel inside. It's just a fact

[Chorus 1:]
That you should be mine. Anything you want
You've got to fortify my love, you fortify me,
You should be mine. Anything you want
You've got to fortify my love

[Chorus 2:]
And you woo-woo-woo, and you woo-woo-woo
And you woo-woo-woo.
You should be mine, all mine

Any way that your heart has been denied
Ooh, you can come to me
Every time that were together
Just becomes the good thing weve got
Something this good can't be defined. One things for sure

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2: x2]

In the height of your worries
Worries runnin too deep for you
When it all becomes too much, too much, too much
I'll pull you through
I can't hold back, what I know inside. It's just a fact

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2: x3]
