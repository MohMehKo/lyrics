The first time - ever I saw your face
I Thought the sun - rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars - were the gifts you gave
To the dark - and the ended skies,

And the first time - ever I kissed your mouth,
I felt the earth move in my hands,
Like a trembling heart - of a captive bird
That was there - at my command, my love,

And the very first time - ever I lay with you
I felt your heart - so close to mine
An I know our joy - would fill the earth
And last and last and last, and last
Til the end of time, my love,
ooh, and the first time - ever I saw your face
Your face, your face...
