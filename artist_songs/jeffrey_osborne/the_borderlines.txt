Hey, the borderlines
Were closing in on the other side
With her love on my mind

I was just a working man
Working overtime in a foreign land
Tryin to make a deal but knowing
Of thin paper walls

I met her in a small caf
We shared some time over Beaujolais
Within a short span of time
We fell in love

Hey, the borderlines
Were closing in on the other side
With her love on my mind

We shared our body love through the night
Though we knew the end was in sight
We never stopped to think our love might not be

Borderlines
Could keep her love from me
Borderlines
Could say what I can see

Borderlines
Can tell me what can be
Borderlines
They will not control me, no

Borderlines
Could keep her heart from me
Borderlines
Could say what I can see

Borderlines
Can tell me what will be
Borderlines
They will not worry me, no

Hey, the borderlines
Were closing in on the other side
With her love on my mind

So we devised a working plan
A new disguise to fool any man
Cause that's the only way we could be wed

And once we saw arrangements were made
We knew that we could not then delay
Authorities were hot on our trail as we got away

Borderlines
Won't keep her love from me
Borderlines
Won't say what I can see

Borderlines
Won't tell me what can be
Borderlines
They will not control me, no

Borderlines
Won't keep her heart from me
Borderlines
Won't say what I can see

Borderlines
Won't tell me what will be
Borderlines
They will not worry me, no

Borderlines
Won't keep her love from me
Borderlines
Won't say what I can see, no

Borderlines
Won't tell me what can be
Borderlines
They will not worry me, no

Hey, the borderlines Borderlines
Were closing in on the other side
With her love on my mind

Hey, the borderlines Borderlines
Were closing in on the other side
With her love on my mind

Let's rock, let's go
