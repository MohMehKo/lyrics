Ooh oh oh oh

Turn down the lights, let the midnight magic flow
Lay by my side, love is all we need to know
Believe in this feeling shining in the dark

My sweet baby we belong to love
Sharing every beat of life
You and me belong to love
Nothing ever felt so right, right

Don't be afraid, when emotion takes control
This night is ours and we'll never let it go
Sensations start wakin', no time for hesitation

Baby we belong to love
Sharing every beat of life
You and me belong to love
Nothing ever felt so right, wo oh oh

Whenever you need someone who cares
Don't worry baby I'll be there (I'll will be there)
This is the start of something good
Tonight in love

Each moment (each moment) love's flow is high
We're flying high
Sweet passion (sweet passion) keeps shining on
Side by side
Let me keep you warm till midnight meets the dawn cause baby we belong to love
Nothing else is real when heaven makes you feel so, so good hey now
Ooh
Let me keep you warm (baby, baby, baby, baby) till midnight meets the dawn cause baby we belong to love
Baby, baby, baby we belong to love
(Nothing else is real when heaven makes you feel so, so good hey now)
Baby, baby, baby, heaven makes you feel so doggone good

Let me keep you warm (yeah) till midnight meets the dawn cause baby we belong to love
Nothing else is real when heaven makes you feel so, so good, so good, heaven makes you feel so doggone good
Let me keep you warm till midnight meets the dawn cause baby we belong to love
Ooh oh we belong to love yes we do now
Nothing else is real when heaven makes you feel so good
