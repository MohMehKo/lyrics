Oh it's a race race get back to the car
I know mediocrity is not that far
She said "Go go we gotta' win"
To make love acceptable I smile and sin

Well taste taste just another lick your soul
Walking pretty you make me sick and
Sip sip my magic potion
I'm looking for action not for emotion

Well I'm going crazy who wants to go?
State your position let's lock and load
I'm going crazy who wants to go?
State your position
Let's lock and load

Not right
It's just not right
Put the love onto someone else
Today I'm on myself

It's just not right
It's just not right at all
With somebody else's soul
Today I'm in control

Shred strings that just a'trap you
Give me your opinion and I'll give it back
Well I know just what you're thinking
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it

Well I'm going crazy who wants to go?
State your position let's lock and load
I'm going crazy who wants to go?
State your position
Let's lock and load

Then you know

Not right
It's just not right
Put the love onto someone else
Today I'm on myself

It's just not right
We're just not right at all
With somebody else's soul
Today I'm in control

(I'm in control)

I believe sobriety
Has killed society
I believe there's nothing left
For generation x

'Cause we're the walking dead
Has anybody seen my head
Tell me another lie as I
Kiss you goodbye

'Cause it's just not right
It's just not right
Put the love onto someone else
Today I'm on myself

It's just not right
You're just not right at all
With somebody else's soul
Today I'm in control

It's just not right
Right

It's just not right (You're just not right)
It's just not right at all
With somebody else's soul
Today I'm in control
