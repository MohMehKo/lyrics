Come from a far away land
Where strangers hold your hand
Under the stars in a horse and cart
We made the Earth our bed
They said we were mislead
But they don't know
We've got a field where love grows

And we are broken
But we're fucking beautiful
We got no money
But everything is alright, alright
We don't need money to feel alright
Cause we've got freedom
Cause we've got freedom
(We've got freedom)

I've sailed across the sea
Stone Henge to New Delhi
Looking for ya, California
You'll never be alone
We've found a place to call home
Come together
Where nothing lasts forever

And we are broken
But we're fucking beautiful
We got no money
But everything is alright, alright
We don't need money to feel alright
Cause we've got freedom
Cause we've got freedom
(We've got freedom)

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Yeah, we've got freedom
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

We're fucking beautiful
Cause we've got freedom
(We've got...)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Cause we've got freedom
