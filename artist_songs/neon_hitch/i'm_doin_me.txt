I've been looking for the hidden treasure.
All I needed was to look inside.
If the bitter makes the sweet taste better, bring the lemons and I'll take a bite. 

I came from London to Paris, New York than Miami.
My journey has made me a One Women Army.
Bruised and was scarce, but we're heading for the stars.

Finally, I'm doin me
Finally, I'm doin me
Finally, I'm doin me

Call me Neon we are all electric.
We'll be gathered, by the stars tonight.
Freedom is a land of no pretending.
Freedom is a place for You and I.

I came from London to Paris, New York than Miami.
My journey has made me a One Women Army.
Bruised and was scarce, but we're heading for the stars.

Finally, I'm doin me
Finally, I'm doin me
Finally, I'm doin me

Yeah, I feel good.
I guess it's all about time, and have to loose myself to find it.
It's funny how somebody told me, I couldn't be somebody that I was born to be.
But I'm a fighter, and I'm a laugh.
I'm tearing up the disguise, in front of a man who dressed me in lies.
We dancing in the dust, we come from under rocks, and everyone can see, I'm doin me. 

I'm doin me
I'm doin me
Why don't you do you? 
Cause I'm doin me
Me...

Finally, I'm doin me
Cause I'm doin me
Finally, I'm doin me
