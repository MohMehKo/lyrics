I'll make you come alive
I can light up, I just need a match
I'll get you fired up when I attack
Imma bite ya, Imma leave it fresh
I'll set the night off, I don't hold back

Callin' all the creatures of the night
I got a fever that can't be locked up inside
I'm like a soldier, but I will never die
'Cause the taste of your lips keeps me alive

I can light up, I just need a match
I'll get you fired up when I attack
Imma bite ya, Imma leave it fresh
I'll set the night off, I don't hold back
I'll make you come alive
Come alive, come alive
I'll make you come alive
Come alive, come alive

I'm a killer from dusk till dawn
Only thing better than you is more
I do it danger - danger - dangerous
I know you like it danger - danger - dangerous
So kiss yourself goodbye
Baby, you've been warned

I can light up, I just need a match
I'll get you fired up when I attack
Imma bite ya, Imma leave it fresh
I'll set the night off, I don't hold back
I'll make you come alive
Come alive, come alive, come alive
I'll make you come alive
Come alive, come alive, come alive

I'll make you come alive
I'll make you come alive
Come alive, come alive
I'll make you come alive
Come alive, come alive, come alive

I can light up, I just need a match
I'll get you fired up when I attack
Imma bite ya, Imma leave it fresh
I'll set the night off, I don't hold back
I'll make you come alive
Come alive, come alive, come alive
I'll make you come alive
Come alive, come alive, come alive
