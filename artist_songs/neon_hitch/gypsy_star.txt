I walk around with a tablecloth in my hair
They call my Marilyn
In a caravan, gunshots wake me up
If I got teacup it's full with Jameson
Don't need a million rubies in my pocket to get by

I say, this is for my people, all the gypsy stars
They call us illegal, that's just who we are
This is for my people, ghetto gypsy stars
They call us illegal, that's just who are
We are

We don't need your money
Your money is no good around here
Cause we get it for free [x4]
I'm a gypsy star, All my gypsy stars [x4]

I walk around with a tablecloth in my hair
We are the infamous
I know you heard of us
No, I don't do no witchcraft
But you know the bitch packs
See us rolling up, on a gypsy bus
No roof cause we hold our flags up high

I say, this is for my people, all the gypsy stars
They call us illegal, that's just who we are
This is for my people, ghetto gypsy stars
They call us illegal, that's just who are
We are

We don't need your money
Your money is no good around here
Cause we get it for free [x4]
I'm a gypsy star, all my gypsy stars [x4]

I don't need your money
Your money is no good around me
Cause you know a drink tastes better
If you get it for free

We don't need your money
Your money is no good around here
Cause we get it for free [x4]
I'm a gypsy star, all my gypsy stars [x4]
