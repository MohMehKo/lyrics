Boy you knew I'm overdosing on your love like
Feeling a buzz and your touch got me so I
I'm like a red light, a neon red light
I should say no but I'm fucking you all night, no, oh

Grade & liquor
I need that grade & liquor
Cause it's been a long night yeah
A long life, and I'm ready for letting go

Sucking on your lips cause they taste like light
Never for me but it's what I like
Feel like I'm holding on, feel like I'm no one
He like a drug, oh yeah I need some, oh, no

Grade & liquor
I need that grade & liquor
Cause it's been a long night yeah
A long life, and I'm ready for letting go

Oh, you don't know me like that do you
We ain't got no trust, we ain't got no trust
Oh, you don't know me like that do you
We ain't got no trust, we ain't got no trust
