This Is Not Fair, I Am Beyond Repair
Coz Of You
You-u-u-You, You-u-u
Can't Find My Head, So I've Fallen Instead
Over You
You-u-u-You, You-u-u
Blood On My Sleeve,I Give More Then You Need
Yes I Do
Do-o-I Do, Do-o-o
Frightened You'll Creep, So I Cry In My Sleep
Yes I Do
Do-o-I Do

Oh! I-I-I-I-I Poisoned With Love, Love
But I-I-I-I-I Can't Get Enough, Enough
So I-Keep-Wal-King On Broken Glass
For Youuuuuuu
I'll-Keep-Wal-King On Broken Glass
For Youuuuuuu

This Is Not Fair, But I've Lost Every Care
I Want You
You-u-u-You, You-u-u
I Wear These Tears, And Pretend Their Not There
Just For You
You-u-u-You
Hurtin' Myself, You Say That I Need Help
And I Do
Do-o-o-Do, Do-o-o
Under Your Spell, If You Look You Can Tell
I Love You
You-o-I Do

Oh! I-I-I-I-I Poisoned With Love, Love
But I-I-I-I-I Can't Get Enough, Enough
So I-Keep-Wal-Kin' On Broken Glass
For Youuuuuuu
I'll-Keep-Wal-Kin' On Broken Glass
For Youuuuuuu

For Youuuuuuu
For Youuuuuuu

Oh! I-I-I-I-I Poisoned With Love, Love
But I-I-I-I-I Can't Get Enough, Enough
So I-Keep-Wal-Kin' On Broken Glass
For Youuuuuuu
I'll-Keep-Wal-Kin' On Broken Glass
For Youuuuuuu

I'll-Keep-Wal-Kin' On Broken Glass
For Youuuuuuu
I'll-Keep-Wal-Kin' On Broken Glass
For Youuuuuuu
