Roll up, I'm having a yard sale with my old stuff
I gotta get rid of this old love
The satisfaction isn't guaranteed
No money back, no money back
I'm moving on, and I ain't taking nothing
Cleaning up, put my troubles in the dust bin
My stereo ain't playing love songs, no no...

I’m having a yard sale, giving away all of the things that I used to call my own
I’m having a yard sale, giving away all of the memories that used to fill our home
I got a box, I gotta pack all of these boxes, and I'm giving 'em all away for free
Cause in the box there is a person that could love you
But that person is the old me, yeah that's the old me
Yeah that's the old me
(I'm having a yard sale, yard sale)
That person is the old me
Yeah that's the old me

Closed box
I buried our pictures in the closed box
You only love me with my clothes off
Well, I took your ring off my finger, middle finger
Breather, look at it now
I'm moving on, and I ain't taking nothing
Cleaning up, put my troubles in the dust bin
My stereo ain't playing love songs, no no...
