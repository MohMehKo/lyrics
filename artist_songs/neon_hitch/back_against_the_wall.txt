Funny how they do it these days
It's got me backed up, got me locked in chains
Don't give a fuck about this,
Don't give a fuck about that
Sometimes I don't go your way,
Don't believe you say everyday can be the same
Don't give a fuck about that!

No-oh-oh, I'ma stand here with my back against the wall
Back against the wall, oh oh oh
I'ma stand here with my back against the wall
Back against the wall, oh oh oh

Time to rip the tape of your mouth,
Ready for some trouble when the truth comes out
'Cause I'm all about that
Yeah, I'm all about that
No need go silence in the crowd
We just get loud when we're pushed to the ground
Yeah, we all about,
I say we all about that, yeah!

No-oh-oh, I'ma stand here with my back against the wall
Back against the wall, oh oh oh
I'ma stand here with my back against the wall
Back against the wall, oh oh oh
No no no, I'ma stand here with my back against the wall
Back against the wall, oh oh oh
I'ma stand here with my back against the wall
Back against the wall, oh oh oh
