I try to keep you by my side
Every time we say goodbye it's salt to my eyes
All black if you turn your back
I hate they way that people say we over react

Your my Clyde and I'm your Bonnie
Our life is a movie
Don't need cameras, don't need lights
Cause we always rolling, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't speak
I know you love me
When I'm laying beside you
We don't need no subtitles
You make my body weak
Oh, it's about to get wild
We don't need no subtitles

[Chorus]
Don't have to spell it out
I feel you clear and loud
Cause we don't need no subtitles
This time I've seen it all
Inside my crystal ball
Yeah, we don't need no subtitles

Two hearts, we beat in the dark
Like Marilyn and Kennedy, can't keep us apart

Your my Clyde and I'm your Bonnie
Our life is a movie
Don't need cameras, don't need lights
Cause we always rolling, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't speak
I know you love me
When I'm laying beside you
We don't need no subtitles
You make my body weak
Oh, it's about to get wild
We don't need no subtitles

[Chorus]
Don't have to spell it out
I feel you clear and loud
Cause we don't need no subtitles
This time I've seen it all
Inside my crystal ball
Yeah, we don't need no subtitles

Black and white film
Crying at the morbid scenes
She's Norma Jeane
Normally having enormous dreams
Two lovers who hardly talk to each other
Their lust speaks louder that words
Like a silent movie
And more gangster flicks
That real gangster shit
Got a sidekick gypsy chick
Robbin' banks and shit
Wanna hit that
My baby girl, she gets that
She gets cash, then gets back
Money stashed in a head wrap
You and me, we should probably slide
Like bonnie and clyde
Hiding in an anonymous ride
I've got a fully loaded tommy inside
For the red lights
I'd rather be dead wrong
That's better than dead, right?
She always wanted to journey the world far
So she left town with a movie star
I guess she always fell for the bad boys
Even though he cheats a lot
Cause love isn't really love until you bleed a lot
He said, "Come on, it'll be so fun
The next train leaves at 3:01
(Train whistle) That's me."
Yo I didn't get inside
I found a big shoulder to lean on
Put my knee on it and hitched a ride
Ay yi yi, lucky me, in fact
She died in the man's arms when that train crashed
So maybe there is beauty in tragedy like Marilyn
But what's the point of paradise with no one there to share it with

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't speak
I know you love me
When I'm laying beside you
We don't need no subtitles
You make my body weak
Oh, it's about to get wild
We don't need no subtitles

[Chorus]
Don't have to spell it out
I feel you clear and loud
Cause we don't need no subtitles
This time I've seen it all
Inside my crystal ball
Yeah, we don't need no subtitles
