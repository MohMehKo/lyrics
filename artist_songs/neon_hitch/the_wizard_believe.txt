You taught me the shit I must know
So I'm walking out here solo
Listening to the beetles
And my favorite thing they said was
All you really need is love
I know they can be critical
But the only time we give up
Is when were in heaven
Yeah

Just hold your head up high
(If you do believe you do believe)
Spread your wings and fly
('Cause I do believe I do believe)
Someday we will find a place that we are finally free
Hold your flag up high

Do you believe in
(I do believe I do believe in)
(I do believe I do believe in)

Do you believe in
(I do believe I do believe in)
(I do believe I do believe in)

Do you believe in
(I do believe I do believe in)
(I do believe I do believe in)

May 25th '86 my house burned down into bits
But we didn't let it stop us no we begun life on the bus
Shit makes all the flowers grow, unusual is beautiful
And every single one of us yeah we'll meet in heaven
Yeah

Just hold your head up high
(If you do believe you do believe)
Spread your wings and fly
('Cause I do believe I do believe)
Someday we will find a place that we are finally free
Hold your flag up high

Do you believe in
(I do believe I do believe in)
(I do believe I do believe in)

Do you believe in
(I do believe I do believe in)
(I do believe I do believe in)

Do you believe in
(I do believe I do believe in)
(I do believe I do believe in)
(I do believe I do believe in)
(I do believe I do believe in)
(I do believe I do believe in)
(I do believe I do believe in)
(I do believe I do believe in)
(I do believe I do believe in)
