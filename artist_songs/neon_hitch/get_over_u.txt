We've Been Here Before, I'm Done Losin' Hope
Of All The Bad Boys, You're Badder Then Most
And I Couldn't See All Your Flaws Below Your Charms
And You Cannot See All My Scars, Your Love Has Caused

See I Will Get Over Yooouuu
You're Not The Man I Once Kneeewww
You've Taken The Best Of Me
Left Me With Nothing New
See I Will Get Over Yooouuu

I'm Takin' That Chance, And I'm Breakin' Free
You've Hid Me Away, Now I Can't Find Me
And I Couldn't See All Your Flaws Below Your Charms
And You Cannot See All My Scars, Your Love Has Caused

See I Will Get Over Yooouuu
You're Not The Man I Once Kneeewww
You've Taken The Best Of Me
Left Me With Nothing New
See I Will Get Over Yooouuu

I Cut, These Ties, We Say, Goodbyes
To Love, You Not, Would Be, A Lie
Now Go, And Find, Ano-Ther Mind
To Stain, The Way, That You Did To Mine
That You Did To Mine
That You Did To Mine
That You Did To Mine
That You Did To Mine

See I Will Get Over Yooouuu
You're Not The Man I Once Kneeewww
You've Taken The Best Of Me
Left Me With Nothing New
See I Will Get Over Yooouuu
