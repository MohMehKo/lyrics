[Neon Hitch:]
Do you remember when you used to call me baby, baby?
Do you remember when I used to be your number one lady?
I used to turn up, I used to dress up, for you
I used to do everything that you wanted me to do
But you don't have to feel so bad for me, no no
Cause I feel sorry for you

Our love could make headlines in the news
Our love could make headlines in the news
Now I feel so sorry for you

[Liam Horne:]
I just wanna tackle dive you each and every night
And I just wanna give you loving cause that pussy's tight
Yeah, yeah, tonight
Let's get high

[Neon Hitch:]
Do you remember when I gave you everything?
Do you remember?
Do you remember when you tore my heart off of your sleeve?
And now we're both just drinking to get sober
Our love is just a fucked up four-leaf clover, baby
I know that I could be better for you
But I swear that you should've treated me right
But you feed me, that ecstasy
Until we're boiling over, in fields of four-leaf clovers

Our love could make headlines in the news
Our love could make headlines in the news
Now I feel so sorry for you

[Liam Horne:]
I just wanna tackle dive you each and every night
And I just wanna give you loving cause that pussy's tight
Yeah, yeah, tonight
Let's get high

I remember when you used to be my number one lady
Called you every night, now you ain't even picking up the phone lately
You drive me crazy
Never show up when you're dressed up for me
Private flights, dinner dates, had the life livin' luxury
But now I'm still here and I'm suffering but I'll get through
Don't feel sorry for me
Now I'm feeling cause I didn't wanna lose
And I just can't stop my head thinking of you

[Neon Hitch:]
Our love could make headlines in the news
Our love could make headlines in the news
Now I feel so sorry for you
