Gotta be honest, yeah, broke a lot of promises
Gonna hurt someone when we came from, where I come from
My district of misfits and freak shows and clowns
An alleyway of memories you'd wanna leave behind

At the gala
With Mr. Sinatra
In love with the gangster I think that I am
Tomorrow we running from coppers
Let's empty our pockets
Right now while we can

I let these red lights turn to blue lights
I can see white lights when I'm with you
And all these sirens burn up these cool nights
We just see white lights when I'm with you

Two criminals in Bombay with a rickshaw for a getaway
At the airport, when they search you, we cover up our tattoos
â€˜Cause he wooed me then flown me to a foreign land
Dad, I know that you judge me, but he is my man

At the gala
With Mr. Sinatra
In love with the gangster I think that I am
Tomorrow we running from coppers
Let's empty our pockets
Right now while we can

I let these red lights turn to blue lights
I can see white lights when I'm with you
And all these sirens burn up these cool nights
I just see white lights when I'm with you

I let these red lights turn to blue lights
I can see white lights when I'm with you
And all these sirens burn up these cool nights
I just see white lights when I'm with you
