Light flikrs on,
and my eyes when we collide
In the dark I feel you flyin'
In the shadows we are golden!

Oh, I I'll love you till death do us apart,
Uh, oh I, I with the last breath of my heart
'Cause we are like Sparks
We are we are we are alive
Can't wait no longer?
We are like Sparks
We are we are we are alive,
So love me harder

Oh uh uh uh uuh
Oh uh uh uh uuh

Stars hold the plan,
I never know it had the night
Take my hand and show me how
Can you feel my skin, it's burning?!

Oh, I I'll love you till death do us apart,
Uh, oh I, I with the last breath of my heart
'Cause we are like Sparks
We are we are we are alive
Can't wait no longer
We are like sparks
We are we are we are alive,
So love me harder

Oh uh uh uh uuh
Oh uh uh uh uuh
We are like Sparks
Oh uh uh uh uuh
Oh uh uh uh uuh
We are like Sparks

Ey ey eh eh eh [x4]

'Cause we are like Sparks
We are we are we are alive
Can't wait no longer
'Cause we are like Sparks
We are we are we are alive
Can't wait no longer
We are like Sparks
We are we are we are alive,
So love me harder

Ey ey eh eh eh [x4]

We are like Sparks!!
