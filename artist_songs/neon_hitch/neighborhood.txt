My mind is a dangerous neighborhood
My mind is a dangerous neighborhood

My mind is a dangerous neighborhood
One sign telling me this place ain't no good
Won't you come on over, come on over
Know that we always have a riot
There's a war and my thoughts keep going for blood

You need protection, you'll be alright
Cause I won't let you walk these streets at night
On every section, there is a crime
You'll wanna hide from the streets at night cause

My mind is a dangerous neighborhood
My mind is a dangerous neighborhood
My mind is a dangerous neighborhood
My mind is a dangerous neighborhood

Mm, yeah, oh
Mm, yeah, oh

If you read the news today it would say I'm fine
Cause I'm so fucking good at faking a smile
But won't you come over, if you come over
I promise tonight will be a riot
We can walk hand in hand through the neon fire

You need protection, you'll be alright
Cause I won't let you walk these streets at night
On every section, there is a crime
You'll wanna hide from the streets at night cause

My mind is a dangerous neighborhood
My mind is a dangerous neighborhood
My mind is a dangerous neighborhood
My mind is a dangerous neighborhood

Mm, yeah, oh
Mm, yeah, oh
Mm, yeah, oh
Mm, yeah, oh

My mind is a dangerous neighborhood
