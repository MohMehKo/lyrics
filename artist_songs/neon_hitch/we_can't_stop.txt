Our breakfast is Jack in a caravan
This is Norma Jeane before the Marilyn
Just when you thought I'd been silent
MY tribe gearin' up for a riot

If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a hello?
Cause we gonna go all night
'Till we see the red lights, alright

So la da di da di
I like to party
Dancing with gypsies
Trouble always gonna find me

Cause this is my life
We make our own rules
And we can't stop
We won't stop

Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life?
We can't stop
We won't stop
We run things, things don't run we
Don't take nothin' from nobody
