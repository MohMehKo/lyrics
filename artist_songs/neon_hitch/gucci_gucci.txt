One big room full of bad bitches

And we stunting like
Gucci Gucci, Fendi Fendi, Prada
Other bitches wear that shit so I don't even botha'
Gucci Gucci, Fendi Fendi, Prada
Other bitches wear that shit so I don't even botha'
Other bitches wear that shit so I don't even botha'

I put that on my partner, I put that on my family
London town I represent 
Address me as your majesty
Yeah you can kiss the ring, but you'll never touch the crown
Only smoke a joint no blunts and now you're never comin' down
You ain't no Barbie, bet you work at Arby's
Number 2, super size, hurry up I'm starving

Gnarly, radical, on the block I'm magical
See me, I'm the fucking shit
Call me Mrs. Adderall
Call me if you need a fix, call me if you need a boost
See them other chicken heads? They don't never leave the coop
I'm in the coupe cruising, I got the stolen plates
I'm here to make, to stay then right back to the states
I'm colder than the fridge and the freezer
And now I'm comin' for ya, geezer's

And we stunting like
