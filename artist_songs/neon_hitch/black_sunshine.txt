Might as well give it a try
I get excited when I see the light 
Looking for a reason why 
I should know 

I know, I know, you don't all agree
And now you're disappointed in me
But I'm a rebellion
I wanna be free, so

And they call him Black Sunshine
I will be gone for a while
'Cause I went and got myself
A new best friend

Until the end, I love until the end
End, end
I love until the end
End, end

My black sunshine

Until death do us part
Got a bad cracked light
I can't see far
The gravel leaves me scarred
But this love got me hurt 

I know, I know you don't all agree
And now you're disappointed in me
But I'm a rebellion
I just wanna be free, so

And they call him Black Sunshine
I will be gone for a while
'Cause I went and got myself
A new best friend

A love until the end, I love until the end
End, end
I love until the end
End, end 

My black sunshine 
My black sunshine 
My black sunshine
My black sunshine
