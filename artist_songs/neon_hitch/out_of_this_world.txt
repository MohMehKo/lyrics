Hold me, I'm yours tonight.
Get me all starry eyed
I just can't get enough, get enough of your love
I just can't get enough, get enough
I just can't get enough, get enough of your love
Just can't get enough of you

Lift me up, don't wanna come down
I'm in love, won't you stay around?
I get all blushed whenever you're around
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know that you're

Out of this world, out of this world
You're out of this, out of this world
Out of this world, you're out of this
Out of this world, out of this world
You're out of this world, you're out of this world
Out of this world, out of this world
You're out of this, out of this world
Out of this world, you're out of this
Out of this world, out of this world
You're out of this world

Baby, take me out with you
Fly me over your moon
I just can't get enough, get enough of your love
I just can't get enough, get enough
I just can't get enough, get enough of your love
Just can't get enough of you

Lift me up, don't wanna come down
I'm in love, won't you stay around?
I get all blushed whenever you're around
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know that you're

Out of this world, out of this world
You're out of this, out of this world
Out of this world, you're out of this
Out of this world, out of this world
You're out of this world, you're out of this world
Out of this world, out of this world
You're out of this, out of this world
Out of this world, you're out of this
Out of this world, out of this world
You're out of this world

You're out of, out of, out of this
You're out of, out of, out of this
You're out of, out of, out of this
You're out of, out of, out of

I just can't get enough, get enough of your love
I just can't get enough, get enough
I just can't get enough, get enough of your love
Just can't get enough of you

Lift me up, don't wanna come down
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know that you're
Out of this world, out of this world
You're out of this, out of this world
Out of this world, you're out of this
Out of this world, out of this world
You're out of this world

Out of this world, out of this world
You're out of this, out of this world
Out of this world, you're out of this
Out of this world, out of this world
You're out of this world, this world
