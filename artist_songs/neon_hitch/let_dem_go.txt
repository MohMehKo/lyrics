Eyes of gold, I didn't even know who you were
Who you could be, be for me, ooh
But I got somebody at home, you know that I hate to be alone
Boy, youâ€™re a stranger that made me forget all the rest

So I let them go, let them go, let them go
Just let them go, baby let her go, let her go, let him go
Let them go, let them go, turn it up baby let them go
Just let them go, baby let's just lose control
Let them go, let them go
Just let them go, just let them go

[Calix:]
Eyes of gold, covered in truth it shows
Who you are, who you could be, not far from me
But I got somebody at home and I just hate to feel alone
Girl you're a stranger that made me forget all the rest

[Neon Hitch:]
So I let them go, let them go, let them go
Just let them go, baby let her go, let her go, let him go
Let them go, let them go, turn it up baby let them go
Just let them go, baby let's just lose control
Let them go, let them go
Just let them go, just let them go

Oh baby yeah I feel like I bore you
My love is like a summertime
Every time I hear you I just die a little baby
But he can't touch me just like you do
I hear of love but this shit right here is true
Mmm yeah, mmm yeah

Let them go, let them go
Just let them go, just let them go

[Neon Hitch & Calix:]
Once was haunted, can't afford it
You know that love's a price to pay
Once was haunted, couldn't afford it
You shouldn't have to pay for love
Let them go, let them go, turn it up baby let them go
Just let them go, baby let's just lose control
