Anarchist, anarchist
Anarchist, anarchist

Welcome to me and my anarchy
I'm just the way my mom made me
For the people that don't understand me
I don't give a fuck I'm not your wifey

Raised by wolves I'm a anarchist
I don't play by the rules I'm an anarchist
I fall off the rails like an anarchist
Fucked with a lot of boys that I don't miss, oh

Anarchist, yeah I'm an anarchist
Anarchist, and I'm living my life

Running riots with my family
I ain't trying to hide my story
Even swinging on the pole was a part of me
Poppin' E's at this club party

Yeah you don't know me
Showing off my body while I'm on trapeze
Got in a lot of trouble when I was 15
But I was saved by the anarchy

Anarchist, yeah I'm an anarchist
Anarchist, and I'm living my life

See I'm so pretty wearing all my black and red
Black and red, black and red, black and red
See I'm so pretty wearing all my black and red
Black and red, black and red, black and red
Just so pretty [?] black and red
Black and red, black and red, black and red

Anarchy, made me, understand me, you don't understand me
Anarchy, made me, you don't understand me, understand me
Welcome to me and my anarchy
