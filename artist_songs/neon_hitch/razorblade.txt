I know I should love myself
But your love makes me cut myself
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade

Mama I said, I'd never grow up to be like you
Daddy I swear, I'd never do the things you do

But here I am with a candle in my hand burning at both ends
Ran from the church, calling the devil my best friend

I know I should love myself
But your love makes me cut myself
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade
I know I should love myself
But your love makes me cut myself
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade
I don't want nobody else, so I just cut myself
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade

Why can't a man, just turn them all away
I wear all the scars from all the games that we play

But here I am with a candle in my hand burning at both ends
If you're such a man, tell me why I should stay

I know I should love myself
But your love makes me cut myself
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade
I don't want nobody else, so I just cut myself
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade
Razor, -azor, -azorblade
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade
Razor, -azor, -azorblade
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade

I know I should love myself
But your love makes me kid myself
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade

I know I should love myself
But your love makes me cut myself
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade
I don't want nobody else, so I just cut myself
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade
Razor, -azor, -azorblade
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade
Razor, -azor, -azorblade
Like a razor, -azor, -azorblade
