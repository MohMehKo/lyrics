Forget me not when I'm gone
I was born, born to be
Born to be remembered
Born to be remembered

Like the very first kiss the feeling on ya lips
The very first time that we got that fucking high
Days just like this we will never forget no no oh
But sometimes I wonder why I've been given this life
Roller coaster bumps on a rocky fucking ride
But the voices in my head said were here for a reason yeah yeah

And you might call me crazy but I'm not that crazy I'm just lost
Don't we all get lost
And when you call me different I'm grateful I'm different
I know my life wont be a loss

Forget me not when I'm gone
I was born, born to be
Born to be remembered
Born to be remembered

We were all given a path but god forgot the map
Some people wanna live and others live to give
Oh you know who you are and I will never forget you no no
And now we out here driving guided by stars
Might feel lost but least we know who we are
Yeah we were born to be remembered

And you might call me crazy but I'm not that crazy I'm just lost
Don't we all get lost
And when you call me different I'm grateful I'm different
I know my life wont be a loss

Forget me not when I'm gone
I was born, born to be
Born to be remembered
Born to be remembered

Forget me not when I'm gone
I was born, born to be
Born to be remembered
Born to be remembered

Who ever said we live once
I pray to prove them all wrong
Yeah we'll be missed not forgot
But I'll be back when I'm gone
'Cause every life has a reason
On our knees praying for something to believe in
Legend stains the memory like blood stains the bed
Ink stains the paper with a message and it says
That we were born to be loved
Yeah we were born to be free
We're not born to be slaves
We're born to make history
So whatever your path, don't tread lightly
And whatever your gift, use that shit wisely
