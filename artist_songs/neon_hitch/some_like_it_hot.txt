[Verse 1: Neon Hitch]
I got a fever
An inclination
That's what I got
You turn the heat on me
Some like it hot

Look what we started
A revolution
Take another shot
We like the way it burns
Some like it hot

[Chorus: Neon Hitch]
I'm from that old school
I play it real cool
Cooler than the ice on my Jameson
Still cold
But I like it hot [x4]

[Rap Interlude: Kinetics]
Yeah, Kinetics
She carries a lie
She carefully cries
Happy in photos but nobody notices
Someone who's lonely and barely alive
When Marilyn died, the entire cemetery was live
She was still naked inside of a casket
And sipping a flask when carried inside

[Verse 2: Neon Hitch]
Call out the engine
Ring up the station
A gypsy on the block
Love burns us up the most
Like it or not

I'm on the 301
The train to paradise
That's where it stops
Red lights make us sweat
Some like it hot

[Chorus: Neon Hitch]
I'm from that old school
I play it real cool
Cooler than the ice on my Jameson
Still cold
But I like it hot [x4]
