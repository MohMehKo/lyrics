Hello
That’s me on your speaker
I said hello
I said that’s me on your speaker

Imma keep you up [?]
Cuz I’m runnin’ new regiment
And I’m doing it drunk and wet
Pull it back
I was wild from the beginning
Head to toe I’ll be glistening
Take me in like your vitamin
Sip it back

Hello
That’s me on your speaker
I said hello
I said that’s me on your speaker

I love these drugs, I feel like nothing’s gonna change
I know I’m fucking up when I got money on my brain
All I ever wanted was everything I lost
Swimming from the gutter, got hooked by lines and lust

Hello
That’s me on your speaker
I said hello
I said that’s me on your speaker

I left the circus just to find a new drug
From the woods up to Hollywood
Was it a dream [?] self destruct
Watch me strut
Yeah I keep on, keep on, keep on going
And I’m never ever ever stopping
Just when I thought I’d had enough
I bring it back

Hello
That’s me on your speaker
I said hello
I said that’s me on your speaker

I love these drugs, I feel like nothing’s gonna change
I know I’m fucking up when I got money on my brain
All I ever wanted was everything I lost
Swimming from the gutter, got hooked by lines and lust

Lines and lust
Lines and lust
Lines and lust

I love these drugs, I feel like nothing’s gonna change
I know I’m fucking up when I got money on my brain
All I ever wanted was everything I lost
Swimming from the gutter, got hooked by lines and lust
