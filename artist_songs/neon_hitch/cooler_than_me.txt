If I could write you a song
to make you fall in love
I would already have you up
under my arm

I used up all of my tricks
I hope that you like this but
you probably won't
you think you're cooler than me

You got designer shades just
to hide your face and
you wear 'em around like
you're cooler than me

And you never say hey or
remember my name and
it's probably because
you think you're cooler than me

You got your high brow,
Shoes on your feet and
you wear 'em around like
it ain't shit

But you don't know
the way that you look, when
your steps make that much noise (sh)

See, I've got you
all figured out
You meet everyone's eyes just
to feel seen

Behind your makeup,
nobody knows who
you ever are
who do you think that you are?

If I could write you a song
to make you fall in love
I would already have you up
under my arm

I used up all of my tricks
I hope that you like this, but
you probably won't,
you think you're cooler than me

You got designer shades just
to hide your face and
you wear 'em around like
you're cooler than me

And you never say hey or
remember my name and
it's probably because
you think you're cooler than me

You got your high brow,
switching your walk
and you don't even look
when you pass by

But you don't know
the way that you look when
your steps make that much noise (sh)

See, I've got you
all figured out
You meet everyone's eyes
just to feel seen

Behind your makeup,
nobody knows who
you even are
who do you think that you are?

If I could write you a song
to make you fall in love
I would already have you up
under my arm

I used up all of my tricks, 
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't,
you think you're cooler than me

You got designer shades just
to hide you face and
you wear 'em around like
you're cooler than me

And you never say hey or
remember my name and
it's probably because
you think you're cooler than me
