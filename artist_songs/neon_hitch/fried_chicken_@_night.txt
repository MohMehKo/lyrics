Do ya thang, do ya thang bitch
Do ya thang, do ya do ya do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya thang bitch
Do ya thang, and I'll do mine

Brisk in the morning
Fried chicken at night
Ranch my body
Take one more bite
Waking up confused, with you by my side
I know that we just fucked, but it was just one time
What you wanna say to me, I know that we got differences
What you wanna say to me, I know that we got differences

I'm finger licking good, I'm finger licking good
Now, we're chewing on a tootsie roll
Got us higher than we've been before
I know we both feel it but this is fucking stupid

Now, we're chewing on a tootsie roll
Got us higher than we've been before
I know we both feel it but this is fucking stupid

Do ya thang, do ya thang bitch
Do ya thang, do ya do ya do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya thang bitch
Do ya thang, and I'll do mine

Fried chicken at night
Fried chicken at night
Fried chicken at night

Now, we're chewing on a tootsie roll
Got us higher than we've been before
I know we both feel it but this is fucking stupid

I'm finger licking good, I'm finger licking good
I'm finger licking good

Drugs, I'm finger licking good
Drugs, I'm finger licking good
Drugs, I'm finger licking good

Do ya thang, do ya thang bitch
Do ya thang, do ya do ya do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya thang bitch
Do ya thang, and I'll do mine

Better get my way, better get my way
Better get my way, better get my way
Better get my way, better get my way
Fried chicken at night, fried chicken at night
