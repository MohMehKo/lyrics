Raindrops on her cheek but the sky is dry
School uniform is torn, but she won't say why
Now Alice are you okay?
Are you sure that your fine?
Is there somethin' your try'na hide?

Girls and boys alike
Time to end this fight
Before it's too late

Now you just gotta know I'm here for you
And I will fight until I'm black and blue
Sticks and stones, may break my bones
But it's all worth while if I got you
Because I'm here for you
For you, for you
Because I'm here for you
For you, y-y-you
Because I'm here for you

Day dreamin' out the window, prayin' for help
Too young to talk, but he knows a leather belt
No sonny it's not okay!
Coz I heard his cry
And his daddy still denies

Girls and boys alike
Time to end this fight
Before it's too late

Now you just gotta know I'm here for you
And I will fight until I'm black and blue
Sticks and stones, may break my bones
But it's all worth while if I got you
Because I'm here for you
For you, for you
Because I'm here for you
For you, y-y-you
Because I'm here for you

Coz I am just like you, but I got away
These bruises made me who I am today
And no I'm not okay, I'm just great
Pemass by my side, thank you mr.wade

Now you just gotta know I'm here for you
You, you, you, you
And I will fight until I'm black and blue
Blue, blue, blue, blue
Sticks and stones, my break my bones
But it's all worth while if I got you
