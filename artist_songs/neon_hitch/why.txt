I know I shouldn't apologize but I don't, know why

Why do you do this to me every single fucking time baby
Why do you tell me "You make me feel like I'm going crazy"?

When I get lost I'm trying to call you
But that's not worth my time I swear, I swear

I swear I can be that, I swear
You got me all twisted
And you don't care

Why do you do this to me every single fucking time baby
Why do you tell me "You make me feel like I'm going crazy"?

Like a witness in protection
It's helping me to speak my mind sometimes, but I

I swear I can be that, I swear
You got me all twisted
And you don't care

Drugs and liquor I've been searching so long
For somebody's arms to hold me
Now I'm waking up, I've been running so long
That I've run into the mirror
I'm looking in the mirror thinking why

Why do I do this to myself every fucking time baby
Believing that happiness can come from another is crazy
Why do I do this to myself every fucking time baby
Believing that happiness can come from another is crazy
Why do I do this to myself every fucking time baby
Believing that happiness can come from another, yeah, you know that shit's crazy
You know it's crazy, so why do I

Do it, do it, do it
(Why do I do this to myself?)
(I want it)
Why do I do this to myself?
