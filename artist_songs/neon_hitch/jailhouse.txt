I told the judge I'm innocent
Please set me free from the jailhouse
I told the judge I'm innocent
Please set me free from the jailhouse

Locked up and they lost the key
I'm mad as fuck 'cause by now I'd be on album three
I keep beggin' but no oh oh oh
They wont let me go oh oh oh
I thought it was a dream was a fairytale
Thought it was a castle but it's just a jail
My shark bitten soul is trying to find a way home

And I'm fucked up still fighting
No truck stop, keep driving
Ya gotta drive through them I drive drive through them yeah
Drive drive through them yeah

I told the judge I'm innocent
Please set me free from the jailhouse
I told the judge I'm innocent
Please set me free from the jailhouse

Sick of sleeping on a shelf
I gave ya gold but I ain't giving ya nothing else
So keep on moving slow
I'll do it on my own

Like a preacher in silence
I'm a killer no violence
I just voodoo them I voodoo them yeah
Voodoo them I voodoo them yeah

I told the judge I'm innocent
Please set me free from the jailhouse
I told the judge I'm innocent
Please set me free from the jailhouse

Like a preacher in silence
I'm a killer no violence
Like a preacher in silence
I'm a killer no violence
Like a preacher in silence
I'm a killer no violence
