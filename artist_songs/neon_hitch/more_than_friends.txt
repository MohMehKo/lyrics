The moment I wake up
It's time to leave
Why won't the clock stop
And wait for me
My heart is saying go go
But my mind is saying no no
My locked up the fantasy
You're the only key

Hey baby let's be more than friends
We could be more than friends
You could be my boyfriend
Hey baby let's be more than friends
We could be more than friends
I could be your girlfriend
If I told I loved you
Would you be my boyfriend
If you told me you loved me
I would be your girlfriend

Under the bed sheets
We don't sleep
I gotta a secret 
I Don't wanna keep

Hey baby let's be more than friends
We could be more than friends
You could be my boyfriend
Hey baby let's be more than friends
We could be more than friends
I could be your girlfriend
If I told I loved you
Would you be my boyfriend
If you told me you loved me
I would be your girlfriend
