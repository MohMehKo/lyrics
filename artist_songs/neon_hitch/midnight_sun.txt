It's always one night one night with you
Room 301 in my dressing gown
Bottle of red wine red wine for two
When the sun comes then I come down

He wanna fuck me like a rockstar
The beetles said all you need is love
But I feel empty as this minibar
And in the morning I'm hungover you

You never say that you love me
No oh oh
You always turn over when we're done
Why won't you say that you love me
Yo oh oh
Two bodies under the midnight sun

I left my diamond gold ring on the table
But you saw right through me and said I don't
That's when I asked and you told me no labels
So why do I come back when I promise I won't

He wanna fuck me like a rockstar
The beetles said all you need is love
But I feel empty as this minibar
And in the morning I'm hungover you

You never say that you love me
No oh oh
You always turn over when we're done
Why won't you say that you love me
Yo oh oh
Two bodies under the midnight sun
