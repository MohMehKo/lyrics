They do it good, but I do it better
I was on the run, while you were playing catch up
World is my hood, I'm ago get that
You could try hard, but you ain't never catch us
'Cause we're always on the run
We shoot for stand in Slater
My mouth is like a gun,
You don't wanna be my trigger

Some like it hot, didn't I tell ya?
Gotta rap cart, K call 'em Big butterz
Ghost with the bus, no destination
Every fucking day is another vacation
'Cause we're always on the run
We shoot for stand in Slater
My mouth is like a gun,
You don't wanna be my trigger

You saw the gypsies do it
Not afraid to boom, never run, never pull its
See our gypsies do it,
Bags on the money,
Now we're not afraid to use it
Yeah, 'cause we're always on the run, the run, the run, the run
Yeah, we're always on the run, the run, the run, the run
Ruuun ruuun ruuun

Feel it, don't rush me 'cause I got a plan
I keep a bag full of sins on my caravan
So what? What you gon' sue me?
Ha ha, good luck tryina find me!
'Cause we're always on the run
We shoot for stand in Slater
My mouth is like a gun,
You don't wanna be my trigger
You saw the gypsies do it
Not afraid to boom, never run, never pull its
See our gypsies do it,
Bags on the money,
Now we're not afraid to use it
Yeah, 'cause we're always on the run, the run, the run, the run
Yeah, we're always on the run, the run, the run, the run

We don't need your money
We don't need your money
We don't need your money
