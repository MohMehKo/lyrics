Hello mother, can you hear me now?
Hello papa, do I make you proud?
Am I everything you thought I'd be?

Hello brother, know you'll be a star
Hello sisters, I keep you on my arm
Because you're everything I thought you'd be

They said I'm a dreamer, but my eyes ain't closed
They said I will fall down, but wings ain't broke
They said I won't make it, but now I'm on top

Before I was news, but now I speak up, speak up 

Hello, Hello, oh
Hello, Hello, oh
Hello, Hello, oh oh oh
Hello, Hello, oh
Hello, Hello, oh
Hello, Hello, oh oh oh

Sorry old me, but I gotta leave
City of dreams is where you'll find me
Now I'm everything I want to be

They said I'm a dreamer, but my eyes ain't closed
They said I will fall down, but wings ain't  broke
They said I won't make it, but now I'm on top

Before I was news, but now I speak up, speak up 

Hello, Hello, oh
Hello, Hello, oh
Hello, Hello, oh oh oh
Hello, Hello, oh
Hello, Hello, oh
Hello, Hello, oh oh oh
