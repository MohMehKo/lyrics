Got a five star tattoo
Brand new black ute
I was built to drive
Cruising down the dirt road
Rolling down the windows
Better hold on tight

Waiting on sunset
Chasing that weekend
When I make it there
I'm not gonna hold back
Foot up on the foldback
Fist up in the air

Caught me in second place
Put me back in the race
Give me that lift tonight
Only you can make me shine

Just take my heart and soul
Silver as good as gold
There's a wind upon my back
That won't say die

That's who I am
This is how I ride
I came to live this life
Climb every mountain high
I'm giving all I can
Just try to bring me down
I'll be the better man
Take it or leave it
It's no secret
This is who I am

Kickin' off a new day
Gonna do it my way
Running fast and free
Everybody's got reasons
Something to believe in
Yeah they're just like me

Coming in red hot
Really don't care what
All the doubters say
We'll win them over
Cause every under dog has their day

I'm done with second place
Now I'm back in the race
This story's just begun
And so have I

That's who I am
This is how I ride
I came to live this life
Climb every mountain high
I'm giving all I can
Just try to bring me down
I'll be the better man
Take it or leave it
It's no secret
This is who I am

Woahhh
This is who I
This is who I am
Woahhh
This is who I
This is who I am

Ohh yeah
Ohhhhh

I'm still taking on the best
But you ain't seen nothing yet

That's who I am
This is how I ride
I came to live my life
Climb every mountain high
I'm giving all I can
Just try to bring me down
I'll be the better man
Take it or leave it
It's no secret
This is who I am

That's who I am
This is how I ride
I came to live this life
Climb every mountain high
I'm giving all I can
Just try to bring me down
I'll be the better man
Take it or leave it
It's no secret
This is who I am

Woahhh
This is who I
This is who I am
Woahhh
This is who I
This is who I am
