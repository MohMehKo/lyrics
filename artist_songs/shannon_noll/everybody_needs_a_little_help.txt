You always made it on your own
It was all under your control
Everything on a roll, till now
Never a problem you couldn't face
Two steps ahead of the race
Everything fell into place, till now
Till now

'Cause everybody needs a little help sometimes
'Cause everybody needs a little help sometimes
Everybody needs a little help

We are in this together
I'll never let you down
I was always there
But you never looked around
Till now

'Cause everybody needs a little help sometimes
'Cause everybody needs a little help sometimes
Everybody needs a little help sometimes

We're only human, nobody's perfect
We just gotta realize it

'Cause everybody needs a little help sometimes
'Cause everybody needs a little help sometimes
Everybody needs a little help sometimes
