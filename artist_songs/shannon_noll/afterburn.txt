I was never one to let my guard down
And no one ever got under my skin
I thought I had it all together but somehow
Something about her sucked me in

Everything I thought went out the door
I never dreamed that I'd get caught, get caught

'Caught in the afterburn, totally lost control
The moment that I saw her, I knew that I was gone
I'm caught in the afterburn, nowhere I can run
She's bringing me under now
Can't tell which way's up now
Caught in the afterburn
I'm caught in the afterburn

I almost lose it every time I'm near her
I'm so hung up I can't believe
And she has me wrapped all around her finger
So damn tight that I can't breathe

I don't think I can take this anymore
I wish that I never got caught, got caught

'Caught in the afterburn, totally lost control
The moment that I saw her, I knew that I was gone
I'm caught in the afterburn, nowhere I can run
She's bringing me under now
Can't tell which way's up now
Caught in the afterburn
I'm caught in the afterburn

She draws you in so perfectly
Does it to everyone she needs
It isn't hard to see, you're just like me

'Caught in the afterburn, totally lost control
The moment that I saw her, I knew that I was gone
I'm caught in the afterburn, nowhere I can run
She's bringing me under now
Can't tell which way's up now
Caught in the afterburn
I'm caught in the afterburn
