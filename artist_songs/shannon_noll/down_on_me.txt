Used to be, you and me, we had something 
Whats goin on, somethings wrong, your saying 
nothin 
So let it out, scream and shout, it'll eat 
you up inside 
Let it rain, share the pain, start 
Communicating, yeah 
Dont face it on your own 

[Chorus]
Let it all fal down 
Let it all fall down on me 
Let it all fall down 
Down on me yeah 
Have a little faith in me 
And let it all fall down on me 

Now you know, this world is so, full of 
Heartache 
Your not alone, together I know we can make it 
Let me share the load, Im ready to go 

[Chorus]

This world try to take what you got 
Anytime ready or not 
In the end it's up to you 
Keep on punchin till you break through 

Let it all fall down, down on me yeah 

[Chorus]
