In the dead of night I feel you breathing 
And I ask myself if you're really there 
Maybe you don't know 

That sometimes I need you 
More than I want to 
Sometimes I don't give in 
When i should do 
You tell me you love me 
You're tryin' to convince yourself 
But you just give it away 

[Chorus:]
In the words that you don't say 
Screamin' louder and louder 
And you can't hide what you're missin' inside 
But it's there 
In what you don't say 

When the rain comes down i know you're cryin' 
But you always tell me you're OK 
You surround yourself 
With people to talk to 
Somewhere to run to 
Somewhere where we can talk like we used to 
It's never spoken 
Something has broken down 
And you don't wanna give it away 

[Chorus] 

Sometimes i need you 
More than i want to 
Sometimes i don't give in 
When i should do 
Maybe i should do 
Give it away,give it away,yeah 

And you can't hide what you're missin' inside 
But it's there 
In what you don't say 
The words that you don't say
