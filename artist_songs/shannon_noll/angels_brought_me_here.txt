It’s been a long and winding journey,
But I’m finally here tonight picking up the pieces walking back into the light
Into the sunset of your glory where my heart and future lies
There’s nothing like that feeling when I look into your eyes

My dreams came true when I found you; I found you, my miracle

If you could see what I see
That you’re the answer to my prayers
And if you could feel the tenderness of me
You will know it would be clear, that angels brought me here

Nothing here before you
Feels like I’ve been born again
Every breath is your LOVE
Every heartbeat speaks your name

My dreams came true right here in front of you my miracle

If you could see what I see 
You’re the answer to my prayer
And if you could feel the tenderness of me
You would know it would be clear, that angles brought me here

It brought me here, to be with you
Ill be forever grateful, forever thankful 

My dreams came true when I found you my miracle

If you could see what I see
You’re the answer to my prayers, oh...
And if u could feel the tenderness of me
You would know it would be clear that angels brought me here

You know i love you baby
And if you could feel the tenderness of me
You would know it would be clear, that angels brought me here
