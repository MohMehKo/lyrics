Something is happening here
Someone is hurting deep inside
How do I get out of here
Someone is mumbling and speaking words
That make no sense
I been thinking it over and over again
What am I supposed to do When all I want is you, and

I just wanna keep my promises to you
Baby every single day I'm standing here
Trying to get through
I wanna give you whatever it takes to be closer to you
baby I just wanna keep my promises to you

Something happened tonight
i wanna know what's going on 
Don't tell me I'm the only one
That's keeping it all inside 
Just say the word, please talk to me
If it's hopeless make me see
Cos what am I supposed to do
When all i want is you, and

I just wanna keep my promises to you
Baby every single day I'm standing here
Trying to get through
I wanna give you whatever it takes to be closer to you
baby I just wanna keep my promises to you

Everything I'll give you, I'll give you
Everything I'll keep my promises
