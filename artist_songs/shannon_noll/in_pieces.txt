You're in my air
Every breath that I take, can't escape
Oooh, everywhere I go
I feel your stare, like you're there
Can't you see I'm scattered
Like memories from the past
Shattered, like a bullet through glass

I'm in pieces of what might have been
Every night I'm spending sleepless
Smoking cigarettes till 3 AM in an empty bed
And I can't get you out of my head

'Cause you burnt your name into my heart
Where it's scarred, I can't erase you from me
Your soul to mine intertwined
You cut the light and I'm drifting
Holding onto the past
Memories, like a bullet through glass

I'm in pieces of what might have been
Every night I'm spending sleepless
Smoking cigarettes till 3 AM in an empty bed
And I can't get you out of my head

Out of my head, out my life
Out of my dreams
Broken emotion
You left me in pieces
