This is a man's world, this is a man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

You see, man made the cars to take us over the road
Man made the trains to carry the heavy load
Man made the electric light to take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark

This is a man's, man's, man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about the little bitty baby girls and the baby boys
Man makes them happy 'cause man makes them toys
And after man made everything, everything he can
You know that man makes money to buy from other men

This is a man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing, not one little thing, without a woman or a girl

He's lost in the wilderness
He's lost in bitterness 
Mmmm
He's lost in the wilderness
