Time keeps leaving us behind
We close our eyes, waiting for the world to change
Wondering where we fit in
And if this is really all there is
What have we missed
Everyone along together
All again for something better

We're looking for a way out
Don't know what we're running from
Wanting an escape out to somewhere we belong
Looking for a way out
Trying to find our way back home
Someone cares for us out there

Looking for a way out of this place
All we want is somewhere to feel safe

Fear, we keep it by our side, it gets us by
The light that keeps us in the dark
Chains around our heart it's all we know
So scared of letting go, so we hold on
All of us along together
All again for something better

We're looking for a way out
Don't know what we're running from
Wanting an escape out to somewhere we belong
Looking for a way out
Trying to find our way back home
Someone cares for us out there

We know we're searching for something
Don't know what we're searching for
Everybody needs a reason
So they can give a little more
Everybody thinks the grass is greener
Till they hit the other side of life
And realize

We're looking for a way out
Don't know what we're running from
Wanting an escape out to somewhere we belong
Looking for a way out
Trying to find our way back home
Someone cares for us out there

Looking for a way out of this place
All we want is somewhere to feel safe
