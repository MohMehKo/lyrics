You're surrounded by friends in all the places
The smiles on all the faces you don't recognize
You've been abandoned by the ones with all the answers
The balances and transfers give you peace of mind

And all I can say is I try everything
To get through to you

You've got walls I'll never climb
You're in a place I'll never find
And even when you're getting close
You're further every time 

You've got walls I'll never climb
You're in a place I'll never find
And even when you're getting close
You're further every time
You're in a place I'll never find

So you are leaving on a plane of good intentions
Saying that we'll be friends and talk real soon
You're guarded by a love that never landed
You're crossing the Atlantic but there's no room

And all I can say is I try everything
To get through to you

You've got walls I'll never climb
You're in a place I'll never find
And even when you're getting close
You're further every time 

You've got walls I'll never climb
You're in a place I'll never find
And even when you're getting close
You're further every time
You're in a place I'll never find
So give up what's surrounding you
And let me get inside
You're in a place I'll never find
