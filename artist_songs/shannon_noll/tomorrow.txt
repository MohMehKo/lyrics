When you feel like crying
And your world has come undone
You're not alone
When you feel like running
But the rain has locked you in
You're not alone, keep hanging on

Life will leave you with a scar
Just remember who you are
And know that I can say
Tomorrow's another day
There is nothing I can do
To take away this pain from you
I know you'll find your way
Tomorrow's another day

And if you need a reason
That will help to get you through
I believe in you
The clouds will keep on moving
And you'll feel the sun again
It'll shine for you, it'll shine for you

Life will leave you with a scar
Just remember who you are
And know that I can say
Tomorrow's another day
There is nothing I can do
To take away this pain from you
I know you'll find your way
Tomorrow's another day

I know sometimes it's hard to find
The reason we feel this way inside
And then it gets so hard to see
Who we need to be

Life will leave you with a scar
Just remember who you are
And know that I can say
Tomorrow's another day

Life will leave you with a scar
Just remember who you are
And know that I can say
Tomorrow's another day
There is nothing I can do
To take away this pain from you
I know you'll find your way
Tomorrow's another day
