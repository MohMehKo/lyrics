Been outside, walkin in circles around the truth 
Just tryin to find a road that doesn't lead back to you 
And there you go painting the walls up around your heart 

It was raining out 
We should have learned by now 

[Chorus]
I know it feels like fate 
Like these are mistakes we're meant to make 
But i've walked that road before searching for more 
And losing it all 

So you're thinkin 'bout givin' it up just to try and find 
Something else 
Something like what we would leave behind 

[Chorus]

Sometimes it takes a lie for us to see the truth 
The reasons why we try to run to something new 
I know someone could break my heart apart from you 
But I don't need them to 
I'd rather be with you 

[Chorus]
I know it feels like fate 
Like these are mistakes we're meant to make 
But if you walk out that door 
I know for sure 
We'll lose it all
