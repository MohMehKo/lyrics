Woke up asleep
Running out of time
Is anyone there
I'm in a dream
Staring at the clouds
They don't make a sound

Hotter than a million suns
Silver shimmer in the air
Waiting for someone to call
I'm just waiting

It's everywhere
Bottled up inside
Does anyone care
And everyday
I hear it in my head
Trying to get out

Hotter than a million suns
Silver shimmer in the air
Waiting for someone to call
I'm just waiting

(Cause I never knew)

I'm just waiting

Calling out to something
Calling out to you

([Cause I never knew)

Calling out to someone
Are you there

Hotter than a million suns
Silver shimmer in the air
Waiting for someone to call
I'm just waiting

Hotter than a million suns
Silver shimmer in the air
Waiting for someone to call
I'm just waiting

(Cause I never knew)

I'm just waiting
