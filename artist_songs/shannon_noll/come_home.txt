I believe I am
The world's stupidest man
And I don't know why I said those things
And just in case you're wondering
I'm over the thrill of letting you go
Proving I'm brave by being cold
And being afraid of letting it show
That I love you more than you could know

Come Home
Come Home

I believe I made
The world's greatest mistake
And I don't know why I act that way
Would you believe me if I said I've changed?
I'm over the thrill of letting you go
Proving I'm brave by being cold
And being afraid of letting it show
That I love you more than you could know

Coz I've got nothin’ left to lose
(Come home)
And everything to prove
(Come home)
Just say it didn't cost me you
(Come home)
I swear I'm telling you the truth
I'm over the thrill of letting you go
Thinking I'm brave by being cold
I'm sorry I made you feel all alone
But I love you more than you could know

Come home
Come home

Come home
Come home

Mmm I am
the world’s stupidest man
