Never thought I'd hold another 
Like I'm holding you right now
But through you I've rediscovered
How to love again somehow

You brought me back from the place 
That I thought no time could erase, till now

Don't know if this will last
Or if our time will come to pass
I'm not concerned with things like where or when
Don't know if it be wise to call that love there in your eyes
I just know it's good to feel this way again

Haven't used this heart for so long
It forgot how to feel
Now that emptiness is all gone
You fill me up with something real

You brought me back from the place 
That I thought no time could erase, till now

Don't know if this will last
Or if our time will come to pass
I'm not concerned with things like where or when
Don't know if it be wise to call that love there in your eyes
I just know it's good to feel this way again

I took one look at your face
It brought me back from the place
i thought no time could erase, till now

Don't know if this will last
Or if our time will come to pass
I'm not concerned with things like where or when
Don't know if it be wise to call that love there in your eyes
I just know it's good to feel this way again
