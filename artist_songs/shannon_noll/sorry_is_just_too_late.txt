I close my eyes
As the tear on the cheek slowly dries
And after tonight
All that's passed is the last of all our goodbyes
We tried to meet halfway
We said all the words we can say

Whether we're wrong, whether we're right
You know everything, everything means nothing tonight
I wouldn't give, you wouldn't take
We both know that saying sorry is just too late

Do you not see in me
All the things that I just see in you
Let's just agree we'd been dancing around
What's been long overdue
You know the story's gonna stay the same
And the story in who gets the blame

Whether we're wrong, whether we're right
You know everything, everything means nothing tonight
I wouldn't give, you wouldn't take
We both know that saying sorry is just too late

Maybe one day baby way down the line
The world might change, we change our minds
Maybe one day we will both remember and get together
Talking about old times, yeah

Whether we're wrong, whether we're right
You know everything, everything means nothing tonight
I wouldn't give, you wouldn't take
We both know that saying sorry is just too late

Too late, too late
Sorry is just too late
Too late, too late
Sorry is just too late
