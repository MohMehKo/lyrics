Why, why do you make it so hard
To stop the rain
Tell me why do you paint every picture in black
And filled with pain

When your life is in color, we find one another
But you push me away

When it all comes crashing down
And I take a look around
Oh, you are all I see, nothing in between
Just you and me

Still I die from the look of distain in your eyes
And I can't speak
How many times must I walk on this sharp broken glass
And turn the other cheek

'Cause when it all comes crashing down
And I take a look around
Oh, you are all I see, nothing in between

It's like your tempting fate
To fall and if I'm gone in the daylight
You know I'll stay right here with you
And it's so hard to carry both of us through
When it all comes crashing down
When it all comes crashing down
