Out of work, out of place and out of love
Even the sun has gone down
I've been searching 
I've been looking all around 
Cos i was lost but now finally I'm found

Tune in on tomorrow
Leave my worries behind
Forget all of my sorrows
Won't let that love drive me blind

The morning light comes through my window and fills the room
I saw the darkness has fled
I can see it, I can see it from my bed
I try not to listen to the voices in my head

Tune in on tomorrow
Leave my worries behind
Forget all of my sorrows
Won't let that love drive me blind

And as the time passes on
I'm slowly drifting back
I search for something that you stole
I'd say it felt like as if i lost my soul
But I'm happy now finally I'm home

Tune in on tomorrow
Leave my worries behind
Forget all of my sorrows
Won't let that love drive me blind
