The past is history 
You can't go back and make it alright 
You never get to choose if you win or lose 
That's not how it goes, oh no 

I know I had it all 
How much more could anyone have? 
And now I'm tryin to find what used to be mine 
Before I went away 

[Chorus]
Everything I wanted 
Was everything I left behind 
I never knew what I'd lose 
And everything I needed 
Was standing right in front of me 
Now I know that it's true 
Everything I wanted was you 

How can I explain 
Looking back I know I was wrong 
I just couldn't see the forest for the trees 
What more can I say 

[Chorus]

Don't say all our bridges are burned 
After all the lessons I've learned 
Is there a chance that you could be mine 
Or am I wasting my time 

Everything I wanted 
Everything I dreamed about 
Was everything I aready had 

[Chorus]
Everything I wanted 
Was everything I left behind 
I never knew what I'd lose 
And everything I wanted 
Was standing right in front of me 
Now I know that it's true 

Everything I needed 
And everything I wanted 
Now I know that it's true 
Everything I wanted 
Was you
