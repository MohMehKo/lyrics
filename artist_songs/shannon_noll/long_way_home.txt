Broken lines in front of me
Horizons far as I can see
Just me and these small town dreams again
Pictures frozen still in time
Frame a thousand last goodbyes
Before I know you’re on my mind again

It’s always over but it’s never quite the end

Here I go
Once again
Standing here with arms wide open
And this time I know I’m not letting go
Breathing in but holding out
I know I’ll find my way somehow
But this road I’m on I always walk alone
On the long way home

Crossed a thousand sunburned plains
I felt the droughts and flooding rains
Tomorrows become yesterdays, yeah
This life I lead I was born to live
I’m giving all I’ve got to give
The greatest journey I’ll begin today

Here I go
Once again
Standing here with arms wide open
And this time I know I’m not letting go
Breathing in but holding out
I know I’ll find my way somehow
But this road I’m on I always walk alone

Inside I know there’s still so far to go
On the long way home
On the long way home

Broken lines in front of me
Faces far as I can see
Just me and these small town dreams

Here I go
Once again
Standing here with arms wide open
And this time I know I’m not letting go
Breathing in but holding out
I know I’ll find my way somehow
But this road I’m on I always walk alone

Inside I know there’s still so far to go
On the long way home
On the long way home

On the long way home
On the long way home
