Tonight’s the night, I’m gonna let it all out
I been working all day, could get a little loud
Jailbreak, escape, baby you and me you know we’re born to shine
Cause tonight we’re gonna celebrate the good times

Well I guess
That’s just the way it goes baby
Living in stereo
You’re on my frequency lately, turn on your radio
You’re really sounding amazing
I think you ought to know
We’re going number one baby
That’s just the way it goes

Living in stereo

The time’s right, ignite, tune in and light up the sound
Cause we can’t get enough, we’re never coming down
So high, now I got the kind of feeling so come on let’s drive
It’s alright we’re gonna keep this town up all night

Well I guess
That’s just the way it goes baby
Living in stereo
You’re on my frequency lately, turn on your radio
You’re really sounding amazing
I think you ought to know
We’re going number one baby
That’s just the way it goes
Living in stereo

So turn the stereo up

Well I guess
That’s just the way it goes baby
Living in stereo
You’re on my frequency lately, turn on your radio
You’re really sounding amazing
I think you ought to know
We’re going number one baby
That’s just the way it goes
Living in stereo

Living in stereo
So turn the stereo up
