Are you feeling alright
Cause I need you tonight
I’ve been moving too slow
Waiting for the sun to show, to show

Do you ever hope for something better
Baby we can make it to the other side
I know that we’re gonna be together
I feel you getting closer at the speed of light
As we collide

Like an angel from above
You’re the sweetest kind of love
We could let it all go
Or crash in to the great unknown
Unknown

Do you ever hope for something better
Baby we can make it to the other side
I know that we’re gonna be together
I feel you getting closer at the speed of light
As we collide

Tonight
We collide

Are you feeling alright
Cause I need you tonight
We could let it all go
Or crash in to the great unknown
Ohhhh

Do you ever hope for something better
Baby we can make it to the other side
I know that we’re gonna be together
I feel you getting closer at the speed of light
As we collide

Yeah
We collide

Ohhh
We collide
