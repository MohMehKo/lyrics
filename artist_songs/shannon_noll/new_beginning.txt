If I'd have known what you would say
I'd have turned and walked away
Can't hold the tears back though i try
Cos there's nothing quite as sad as goodbye

Dont want to think about tomorrow
You won be here by my side
All of a sudden i feel hollow
Theres nothing quite as sad as goodbye

[Chorus]
So im alone again 
Tryin to find a ticket to the next train, to the next train
I'm on my own again, waiting in line
For a new, new beginning
New beginning

I know that we are better off
Still i feel that I've lost
When i look into your eyes
Theres nothing quite as sad as goodbye

[Chorus]

Back where i once started, try my luck again
Now i've got my heart set on a better day, yeah
Who's to say what's waiting just around the bend
Can't do more then hope and pray for a happy end

[Chorus]
