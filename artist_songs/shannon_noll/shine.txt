Get up, get up, get up, get up
And lift your head
C'mon, c'mon
Get up out of bed.
Today's the day you hold the world
With your song

Go now, go now, go now
Help ascalate
Angels come down
Help with this parade
To hear the voice ring out
C'mon let's shout
And let your song be heard

[CHORUS]
This is the time
This is the day
That we've been waiting for
All the world will stop
To watch you shine

Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Sing your hymn
This is the new national anthem
We will all stand on guard
To let you be heard

Let go, let go, let go
All the cannons
How beautiful this world has become
Now everyone will see
What I believe
That these words should be sung

[CHORUS]
This is the time
This is the day
That we've been waiting for
All the world will stop
To watch you shine
This is the time
This is the day
That we've been waiting for
All the world believes
That you will shine

And if you fall
And if you fall
And if you trust and
Yes it will come true

Hey, hey, yeah

[CHORUS]
This is the time
This is the day
That we've been waiting for
All the world will stop
To watch you shine
This is the time
This is the day
That we've been waiting for
When all the world will stop
To watch you shine
