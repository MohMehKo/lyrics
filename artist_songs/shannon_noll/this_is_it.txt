What are we waiting for?
There are no bells and no parades
No one to knock on your door
There are no signs to show the way
All there is is what we have right now
We can act our way and we can fake it

[CHORUS]
This is it
This is life
And there's no break
No second takes to get it right
Yeah, this is life

What are we hiding from?
Maybe the mistakes we've made
Why don't we make some more?
Life's gonna go on anyway
All we get is a moment in time
We can fall right now or we can make it

[CHORUS]
This is it
This is life
And there's no breaks
No second takes to make it right
This is me, talking to you
And all that counts is here and now
And what we do
Yeah, this is life, this is life

Everybody dies but not everybody lives
Everybody takes but not everybody gives
Every single day is another chance to take that ride

[CHORUS]
This is it
This is life
And there's no breaks
No second takes to make it right
This is me, talking to you
And all that counts is here and now
And what we do
Yeah, this is life
And there's no breaks
No second takes to make it right
Yeah, this is life
This is life
This is me and you
