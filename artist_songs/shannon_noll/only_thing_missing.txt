The sun is still rising in it's place, yeah
Again the shadows have all been replaced
A memory can never be erased, no
And nothing has changed about my face, yeah

I've still got the same blue sky
Still got the time that's passing by
I've got another day to get through
I've still got a lot to give
And all the mistakes that I live with
I got another night to get through
The only thing missing is you

A winter has come and gone again, yeah
The water is flowing back to where it began
Nothing can change what's come to pass, no
Until you can't forgive what's passed, yeah

I've still got the same blue sky
Still got the time that's passing by
I've got another day to get through
I've still got a lot to give
And all the mistakes that I live with
I got another night to get through
The only thing missing is you

They say the light that burns too bright
Burns half as long
And all the empty space goes on and on
And you'll always miss that one thing when it's gone

I've still got the same blue sky
Still got the time that's passing by
I've got another day to get through
I've still got a lot to give
And all the mistakes that I live with
I got another night to get through
The only thing missing is you
