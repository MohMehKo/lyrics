Desperately waiting for her to arrive
Longing for strength that I lack
Tears fill my eyes when I realise she's gone
I know that I can't bring her back 
She used to make it so easy to love her
She used to make me shine
So stay if you will and I'll show you
The way she loved me for a time 
Empty, I lie on the bed that we made
But now I can't get to sleep
She had a way of wearing my clothes
And made them look better than me 
She had a heart that could light up the ocean
She told me she was mine
So lend me an ear and I'll tell you
The way she loved me for a time 
Oh, I long to hold her
Oh, I want her here to see
Oh, how I ache for her next to me 
Desperate I wait for the day that I see her
Hold to her deep inside
The most perfect love that I wanted to be her
From the moment she caught my eye 
I light a candle for her every evening
Pour me a glass of wine
I will remember so clearly
The way she loved me for a time
Yes I will remember so dearly
The way she loved me
