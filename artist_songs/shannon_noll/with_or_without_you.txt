See the stone set in your eyes 
See the thorn twist in your side 
I'll wait for you 
Slight of hand and twist of fate 
A bed of nails she makes me wait 
And I'll wait without you 

With or without you 
With or without you 
I can't live 
With or without you 

And you give yourself away 
And you give yourself away 
And you give 
And you give 
And you give yourself away 

With or without you 
With or without you oh 
I can't live 

Oh, oh 
Oh 

With or without you 
With or without you oh 
I can't live 
With or without you
