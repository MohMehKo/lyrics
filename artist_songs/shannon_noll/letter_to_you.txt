Staring out the window, here i go again 
Been down this road a hundred times, Still don't know what's round the bend 
Tryin to figure up from down, Sometimes I dont know where to turn 
I know one thing's for certain, one thing 
I've had to learn 
It was you, I had to work it out 
Now you know it's true, I can't do without 
I sent my heart in a letter to you 
But the pages are torn in two 
I lost my head staring at your photograpgh 
Cause it's hard to write a song for you 
Standing at a crossroad, looking back this way again 
Ive met a thousand people but I'm back where I began 
Living in a daydream where no one ever gets me down 
Your face beyond description, your voice the sweetest sound 
Now I'm sure what I want you to see 
But it's hard to find the words to bring you closer to me 
I sent my heart in a letter to you 
But the pages are torn in two 
I lost my head staring at a photograph 
Cause it's hard to write a song for you 
Impossible to to say to you 
Gone are the rainy days 
Without you I'd be lost and I'd just drift away 
Come so far just to be with you 
Now I'm not letting go no matter what you do 
It was you, I had to work it out 
Now you know I'ts true, I can't do without 
I sent my heart in a letter to you 
But the pages are torn in two 
I lost my head staring at your photograph 
Cause it's hard to write a song for you 
I'll say it in a letter it makes me feel much better 
But the pages, the pages, the pages are torn in two 
Now I'm staring at your picture, it makes me love you deeper 
And it's so hard to write a song for you 
To tell you how I feel for you
