We're always in this situation
Your heart filling your head with doubt
But if you won't communicate then
We're never going to work this out
I know you think you've got your reasons
But I don't understand (help me understand)
Can't you see your wish is my command 
[Chorus:]
You better
(Tell me what you want to hear)
Pretend that I can't read your mind
(Baby make it crystal clear)
As if you were leading the blind
(Baby give me half a clue)
Don't make it so hard to prove
That I love you, like I do
I don't know how to prove it to you 
You make your heart so hard to get to
You put it on the highest shelf
Been hoping since the day I met you
That you would learn to love yourself
It doesn't matter what I do girl
It'll never be enough (never be enough)
Love was never meant to be this tough 
[Chorus:]
You just better
(Tell me what you want to hear)
Pretend that I can't read your mind
(Baby make it crystal clear)
As if you were leading the blind
(Baby give me half a clue)
Don't make it so hard to prove
That I love you, like I do
(Tell me all your hopes and fears)
My guess is they're probably mine
(We can sort them out right here)
Baby don't waste no more time
(Don't make it so hard to prove)
Don't make it so hard to prove
That I love you, like I do 
There's no other way that I know how
To put you at ease (how do I put you at ease)
But If I'm doing something wrong
Then please, baby please 
Tell me what you want to hear
Baby make it crystal clear
Don't make it so hard to prove
That I love you like you know I do 
[Chorus:]
Just tell
(Tell me what you want to hear)
Tell me what you want to hear
(Baby make it crystal clear)
Baby make it crystal clear
(Don't be makin' it so hard to prove)
Hard to prove
(That I'm loving you the way I do)
The way I do
