Sometimes your heart 
It feels so far away 
Sometimes our lives are night and day 
It always seems there's something out there better 
Who knows? 

[CHORUS:]
Before we say goodbye 
Take a breath and think about it 
You're the one who makes me feel 
Ten stories high 
I'll survive and stay alive and 
Take a look down deep inside 
Before we say goodbye 

Sometimes my world 
I feel it sweep away 
I hear your name and I feel safe 
Sometimes we dream of another life we're missing 
But who knows? 

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Before we say goodbye 
Take a breath and think about it 
You're the one who makes me feel 
Ten stories high 
I'll survive and stay alive and 
But I need to know why 
Before we say goodbye
