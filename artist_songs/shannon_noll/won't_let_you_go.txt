Out here alone, so far away
And I'm wishing that I could have stayed
Right where you are, wrapped in your arms
Where I'd hide from this world for one day
Baby I just wanna say

Wherever you are, I want you to know
I will be right there, I won't let you go
No matter how far or how long the road
I will be right there, I won't let you go

Right from the start, you captured my heart
And you guided me out of the dark
Gave me the faith when no one believed
Showed me there's nothing that I couldn't be
Baby I wish you could see
Yeah

Wherever you are, I want you to know
I will be right there, I won't let you go
No matter how far or how long the road
I will be right there, I won't let you go

Wishing you were here, wishing I was there
All you gotta do is just say

I'll be right there, I won't let you go
I'll be right there, I won't let you go

Wherever you are, I want you to know
I will be right there, I won't let you go
No matter how far or how long the road
I will be right there, I won't let you go
