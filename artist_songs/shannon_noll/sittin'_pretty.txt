No need to tell me what your thinking
Cos all the words means nothing at all
Round and sound you keep me turning
But there'll be no one there when you call

Every heart that you break every page you tear
Is there a chance that you take
When your going nowhere, tell me

[Chorus]
Who's sittin pretty now
With the last cards to fall, tell me
Who's gonna hold you now
When it all comes out the same
A little rain must fall on everybody sometmes

If you believe in what your saying
You cant pretend you're lying inside
If there's truth in every story
Then it's the ones you're trying to hold

Everything that you do
Everything that you say
When it comes down to it all
You can't have your own way, tell me

[Chorus]
