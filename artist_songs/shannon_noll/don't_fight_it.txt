Sitting here in the darkness 
And the seconds tick away 
Searchin' in the silence 
For something else to say 
Its ok 
Even though your holding back on me 
What is meant to be 
Is what will be 
Its ok 

Yeah i know its a matter of time 
Before im gonna make you mine 
So let it go 
Baby dont fight it 
We know 
There aint nothin' like it 
Cant stop 
When it gets started 
All along 
Ain't it what we both wanted? 
Just let it go 
We cant deny it 
Your mine so baby 
Dont fight it 

You know you can close your eyes 
But you still see that im right 
You know 
If you close your mind 
You still hear your heart inside 
Its ok 
I know if you try to walk away 
Something will be tellin' you to stay 
Its ok 

[CHORUS]

Something bigger girl 
Has brought us here tonight 
And we don't have to understand it 
To know that it's right, oh 
You know it's right, oh 

[CHORUS]
