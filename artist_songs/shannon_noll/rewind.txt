I heard the shot ring out a second too late
I saw the line attached but I still took the bait
There wasn't a wolf in sight, but I kept crying for help
And I broke every promise I made to myself, and anyone else

I wanna stand there watching the rain fall
Back up to the sky... put life in rewind
One more chance to go back & change it all
And get it all right... Put life in rewind
Life in rewind

My heart was an island with hundred foot walls
And every bridge I'd see, well I...I'd set fire to them all
And I saw the road less travelled. And I walked right on by with the crowd
I bet every cent I had on red. Guess how it turned out

I wanna stand there watching the rain fall
Back up to the sky... put life in rewind
One more chance to go back & change it all
And get it all right... Put life in rewind
Put life in rewind

My world in the balance and I flipped a coin
I could have said sorry, but I was making a point
And all I keep hearing is I had a choice
I made a mistake. Don't tell me it's fate

I wanna stand there watching the rain fall
Back up to the sky... put life in rewind
One more chance to go back & change it all
And get it all right... Put life in rewind
Put life in rewind
Life in rewind

Put life in rewind
Life in rewind
