I never thought that I'd find myself there
The darkest place that I've ever been
I never thought that I'd take this life for granted, but I did
I would've given it all when I was younger
I would've given up everything for a taste
Of the life and the lights and the crowds
But my mind wasn't right, they were lies
Then you came along...

And you switched me, switched me on again
And you showed me what it's like to live
When you found me I was empty
I was too far gone for anybody
Switch me, switch me on again, tonight.

There was story my old man told me when I was young
He said the measure of a man ain't in his bank account
He said be careful of the things you say and what you do
And all the people that you've got hangin around with you
And I lost my way, prodigal son
Of who I am and where I'm from
Ooh, I was blind but now I see
Then you came along

And you switched me, switched me on again
And you showed me what it's like to live
When you found me I was empty
I was too far gone for anybody
Switch me, switch me on again, tonight.

Tonight I've never felt so alive
Just looking in your eyes
I finally realized
What I'm doing with my life.

You switch me, switch me on again
And you show me what it's like to live
When you found me I was empty
I was too far gone for anybody
Switch me, switch me on again,

You switch me, switch me on again
And you show me what it's like to live
When you found me I was empty
I was too far gone for anybody
Switch me, switch me on again, tonight.
