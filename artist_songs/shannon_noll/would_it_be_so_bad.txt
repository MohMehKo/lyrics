Looking out across the water
Sunshine on my skin
I been thinking that we ought to stop and take life in
And I reach for something beautiful
And baby that is you
And I lose my head
I lose my head

And it’s been a while since you and I made a memory
Did we forget
Yeahhh yeahhh

Maybe it’s not so bad
All that we need is what we have
What if we ran and we never came back
Nowhere to be, just you and me
Would it be so bad

We been through some crazy days
No regrets and made mistakes
Only we could understand
But we only find true love just once
Tangled hearts in you I trust
So what if we’ve got no plans

Maybe it’s not so bad
All that we need is what we have
What if we ran and we never came back
Nowhere to be, just you and me
Would it be so bad

There’s nothing about this but the chase
Baby you’re my great escape
I could never live without you, yeah
There ain’t nothing we can’t get through

Maybe it’s not so bad
All that we need is what we have
What if we ran and we never came back
Nowhere to be, just you and me
Would it be so bad

Would it be so bad

Would it be so bad

Ohhhh

Alright
