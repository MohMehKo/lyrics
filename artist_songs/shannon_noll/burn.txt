You struck a match inside
This frozen heart of mine
And set my soul on fire
Stranded dazed and confused
Stumbling drunk on you
Consumed by my own desire
But tell me how
Tell me how you

[Chorus]
Burn right through me
You undo me, yeah
But what a way to go
Oh you twist and turn me
Ignite and stir me yeah
You know I gotta learn how you burn
How you burn
Burn

Lost in a stadium full of frowns
Til your smile turned it all around
Now the mention of your name
Fans the flame, the flame that burns

[Chorus]

I wanna just deserve you
Even just to come close
But everytime we kiss
That thought goes up in smoke
Cos you burn

[Chorus]
