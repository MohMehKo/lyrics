Time to go, all lights out
[?] inside out
Hold my breath it's the cold air of Jan
And I can't wait to get home to you, my darling you

As soon as the eye hits the pavement
And shadows begin there a dream
I walk down the street as a proud man
A path of gold under my feet

Climbed the hill outside town
Wrote our names in wet ground
Now my heart is as full as the moon
And I can't wait to get home to you, my darling you

As soon as the eye hits the pavement
And shadows begin there a dream
I walk down the street as a proud man
A path of gold under my feet

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And I just want to hold you 
And tell you about everything
So just lay down beside me
We won't have to worry again

Now my heart is as full as the moon
And I can't wait to get home to you, 
My darling you

I raise my head in amazement
And thank God we never gave in
I walk down the street as a proud man
A path of gold under my feet

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooh

Time to go
All lights out
