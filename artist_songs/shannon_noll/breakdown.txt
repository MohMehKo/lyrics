You should see me lately, I'm a brand new man
I've been keeping busy, making valued plans
I feel I'm getting stronger and I don't know why

But every now and then, I just give in
I let you break my heart all over again
I make sure there's nobody else around
And I, I breakdown

I've got good at faking that I'm moving on
'Cause I've got tired of saying that there's nothing wrong
I can feel I'm so close to finally letting go

But every now and then, I just give in
I let you break my heart all over again
I drink our favourite red
Get your letters out and I read them loud
I put on all the songs we used to play
And go through all the photos I should throw away
I make sure there's nobody else around
And I, I breakdown 
'Cause I can't see the way out
I breakdown 'cause you did it so easy
I wish you could show me how
