I'm sitting on a train bound for nowhere
Just trying to survive i'm thinking about the love i hold inside me
Its keeping me alive
Wishing i could change it all
Praying, but i can't go back in time
No wonder, no matter what i say or what i do will ever change your mind

[Chorus:]
I'm looking forward now i'm trying to find my way
I'm looking back and i see only yesterday
Cos time is my friend, isn't always real
Can't help singing about the way that i feel

Laying on a deck chair in the sun
Just trying to catch some rays
Thinking about this thing that they call love
To me it's just a maze
Is it in the trees, the breeze 
Or do you see it in a new borns eyes
Or is it when you find the one thats made for you 
There'll never be no goodbyes

[Chorus]

And i know that you love me, yeah
One thing i know was true
In the end i just couldn't see
What was meant for me

I listen to the whisper on the wind
Now i recognise the sound
I'm looking down, deep down, deep inside my heart
And i see i'm glory bound
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
