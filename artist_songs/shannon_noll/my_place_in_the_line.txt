I’m a solo flyer who hates being lonely
And I walk the wire with a net below me
And I want my extra with the ordinary
Sometimes not so much... and sometimes very
It’s so goddamn scary

So let me in if you see me comin your way
Coz I’m still trying to find
My place in the line
A band-aid on my heart... A pile of mistakes
But I’m still trying to find
My place in the line

No matter what...I’m always sayin
‘Absolutely not’... right before I cave in
Got my sins erased with a ‘beg your pardon’
When I think it’s done, I’ve only started

So let me in if you see me comin your way
Coz I’m still trying to find
My place in the line
A band-aid on my heart... A pile of mistakes
But I’m still trying to find
My place in the line

I’m a solo flyer who hates being lonely

So let me in if you see me comin your way
Coz I’m still trying to find
My place in the line.....yeahhh
A band-aid on my heart... A pile of mistakes
But I’m still trying to find
My place in the line..ohhhh
Yeahhhhhh....ohhhhh
My place in the line
