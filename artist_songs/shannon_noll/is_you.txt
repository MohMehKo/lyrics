All I am is you, it's all I want to be
And all I crave is you, please hear me
Oh how can I take back each drop rain that falls
And all I am is you, nothing at all

I don't want you to fade, I don't want you to slip away
I've tried, but it seems I have failed
The weakness in me has stained
It won't wash away
It won't let me sleep or get through the day

Baby 'cause all I am is you, it's all I'll ever be
One heart locked in love, try to believe

Every season is winter in my life again
And I don't wanna feel like this
Every single memory is haunted by your last kiss

I don't want you to fade, I don't want you to slip away
I've tried, but it seems I have failed
The weakness in me has stained
It won't wash away
It won't let me sleep
It won't let me dream of your perfect face

Baby 'cause all I am is you, it's all I want to be
And all I crave is you
