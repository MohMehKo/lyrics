And it feels like rain,like yesterday 
And the clouds roll in,the sunlight fades away again 
And I'm so damn sure,I'm gonna close that door 
You'll be the first to know 
When I've found what I'm looking for 

[Chorus:]
I want to run with the sun on my face 
Ride a train to nowhere,any place 
Feel the thrill of the chase 
Stand where I've stood before 
All I want is more 

So here I go,just me and the radio 
Down open roads,don't know where I'm going 
Anywhere,I don't care 

[Chorus] 

I owe it to myself,not to follow someone else 
Not to turn around 
And ever think of going back now 

[Chorus]
