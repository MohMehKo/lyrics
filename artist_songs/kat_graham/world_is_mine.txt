Summer call me hot
Say I'm cold in the winter
You feelin this heat
I'm turning up the temperature
Got a chip
Cause I waited to enter
So back out my way
Cause I gotta avenge her
10 whole years
And I just got commend her
Gimme a lil stage
And the crowd to attend it
You gotta jam to my sound
Got a little jam
And the skill to assist it
No hater can't stop
If God manifests it
Been around this block
I'm now ready to leave it
Grew up with no stash
Ready to receive it
So gimmie all your loot
All your gold all your cash
Cause me and my crew
Yeah we makin the dash

World is mine now...

I know you likin' my beat [x3]
You gotta jam to my sound
And get down with me
[x2]

It's a black out
Gimmie all your power
Listen to me jam
And come and turn me up louder
Taking it back to 1991
Got my Cross colors United Benetton on
Cassette tape overdub the beat how I want it
Bet they never thought I'd be this big of an artist
Put away your keyboard
Pick up the mic
And sing everything the label like
Well fuck y'all
I can finally do what I want
Got enough cash
Hustling like I'm not
Watch me take a swing
And take it to the moon
Taking it back
Like it was something new

World is mine now...

I know you likin' my beat [x3]
You gotta jam to my sound
And get down with me
[x2]

Know you feeling like you jammin to that old school
I'm here to take you there, start jammin to that old school
[x2]

Taking it back
Taking it back
Taking it back to 1991
[x4]
