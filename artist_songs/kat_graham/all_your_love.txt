Got me in love like a criminal
Play me like a good time rock and roll
Rollercoaster high and low
Got me so out of control
Feeling like the kiss under your fingertips
Melting like sugar when I kiss your lips
Desperate love
Bilingual risk
Have to have you
Need all of it

Give me all your loving here tonight
Gonna make you feel alright
Come a little closer, hit the lights
You been waitin' for this all your life

I want your love
I want it
I need your love
I need it
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want it

Give me all your love tonight
Give me all your love tonight

Smoke you
'Cause I need a hit
Unwrap me like a Christmas gift
Tangled sheets and poker chips
Gamble everything for the love of it
High for you like a fire lit
Call the police and the government
Rated X, ain't for the kids
Give me that back, give me all of it

Give me all your loving here tonight
Gonna make you feel alright
Come a little closer, hit the lights
You been waitin' for this all your life

I want your love
I want it
I need your love
I need it
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want it

Give me all your love tonight
Give me all your love tonight

I want your love
I want your lovin' here, baby
I need your love
I need your lovin' here, baby
I want your love
I want your lovin' here, baby
I need your love
I need your lovin' here, baby

I want your love
I want it
I need your love
I need it
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want it

Give me all your love tonight
Give me all your love tonight
Give me all your love tonight
Give me all your love tonight
