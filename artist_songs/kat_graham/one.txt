You're the rain on my window
You're the moon in my night
Everywhere when you're not there
Cause you're always on my mind

I'm the shade in your shadow
The light in your sun
I'm everywhere when I'm not there
Cause I'll always be your one

Be your pa, pa pa... pa, pa pa
Cause I'll always, be the one
Cause I'll always, be the one
Be the one, who gives you love

Heart beatin', I can hear it
Hear you need me
Keep bringing me, close to you
Just wanna get, close to you

Mind dreamin', you can feel it
Feel you need me
Keep bringing me, close to you
I wanna get, close to you

(Close to you...)

You're the dawn in my morning
You're the hands in my time
You're everywhere when you're not there
Cause you're always on my mind

I'm the water in your ocean
The laugh in your fun
I'm everywhere when I'm not there
Cause I'll always be your one

Be your pa, pa pa... pa, pa pa
Cause I'll always, be the one
Cause I'll always, be the one
Be the one, who gives you love

Heart beatin', I can hear it
Hear you need me
Keep bringing me, close to you
Just wanna get, close to you

Mind dreamin', you can feel it
Feel you need me
Keep bringing me, close to you
I wanna get, close to you

(This is the fucking breakdown!)

When I'm not arou-ou-ou-ound...
I'm still in your mi-i-i-ind...
You're still mi-i-i-ine...
I'm not hard to find...

Be your pa, pa pa... pa, pa pa
Cause I'll always, be the one
Cause I'll always, be the one
Be the one, who gives you love

Heart beatin', I can hear it
Hear you need me
Keep bringing me, close to you
Just wanna get, close to you

Mind dreamin', you can feel it
Feel you need me
Keep bringing me, close to you
I wanna get, close to you

(Close to you...)
