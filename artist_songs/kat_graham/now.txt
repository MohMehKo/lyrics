Ain't gotta tell me
Yeah I know it's my fault
Ain't gotta tell me shit
In it for a minute
And I just won't quit it
Cause I know I can't handle it
You love me so good
Love don't even matter
I've been a bad girl
But you make me badder
Nothing you could do to keep me away from it

I I I I know
You you can't let me go
This is that uh oh
Oh oh...

I know you want it
And you gotta have it
I know you want it
I gotta have it now
(Give it to me...)
[x2]

Believe me if I lead you'll follow
You always comes back to me
Going be the same as it is tomorrow
Know where I wanna be
(Staying right here)
Don't need a shoulder
I just need you lover
Trench coat on like I'm undercover
Nothing I can do to keep you away from me

I I I I know
You you can't let me go
This is that uh oh
Oh oh...

I know you want it
And you gotta have it
I know you want it
I gotta have it now
(Give it to me...)
[x2]

Tried and tried I can't leave you
No matter what you hold me down
And even if I could free you
You're the one I can do without
[x2]

Do without...

I know you want it
And you gotta have it
I know you want it
I gotta have it now
(Give it to me...)
[x2]
