Wait a minute I can see you in it, I know
If the tables were turned you know you'd quit it, boy no
Don't try and play it like you cool, you know that
You, ain't, got it like, got it like that

I said wait a minute I can tell you'd get it, but slow
Down cause you know that I ain't with it, you clown
Frontin' like I'm just another girl, you'd stick cause
You, ain't, got it like, got it like that

Running 'round tellin' all your boys you got
Got the girl, yeah they think you caught
Me no, you better let 'em know
That this ain't, your show

You're just a star fucker
You ain't no real lover
You're just a star fucker
And when I take off, I'm gonna leave ya, so baby look up, see ya

Tellin' me you get it but you shameless, you hang
'round with them girls cause they famous, even
If you got a shot you couldn't hang with, you'd try
Play me like a damn fool, you know it

You wanna be a star but you're aimless, so don't
Hustle a player when you're gameless, inside
All of the ropes you try and tame this, no-o
No-o, you know this

Running 'round tellin' all your boys you got
Got the girl, yeah they think you caught
Me no, you better let 'em know
That this ain't, your show

You're just a star fucker
You ain't no real lover
You're just a star fucker
And when I take off, I'm gonna leave ya, so baby look up, see ya

You wouldn't know, what to do with a
Girls like me, girls like me
You wouldn't, what to do w-
You better stick to crews, and the boos that you're used to
[x2]

You're just a star fucker
You ain't no real lover
You're just a star fucker
And when I take off, I'm gonna leave ya, so baby look up, see ya
