Eighteen wheeler
Stone cold killer
Hit it and quit her
Ba-by

No heart stealer
Sex dealer
Don't pull the trigger
Bang-bang

No you're never gonna take me out
Never never gonna take me out
Eh eh

Should know better
If you go get her
You'll end up in
Flames flames

(Uh oh)
There you go
Gun in your holster ready to blow
(Uh oh)
There you go
Hunting me down like an animal
(Uh oh)
There you go
There you go 
There you go...

I don't wanna be ya, see ya, hear ya
You're a heartkiller
I don't wanna feel ya, can't be near ya
You're a heartkiller
A murderer
Serial lover
I don't wanna be ya, see ya, hear ya
You're a heartkiller

Big fat liar
Pants on fire
To you it ain't nothing but a
Game game

Preaching to the choir
Bullets keep flying
Bet ya look good in
Red red

No you're never gonna take me out
Never never gonna take me out
Eh eh

Should know better
If you go get her
You'll end up in
Flames flames

(Uh oh)
There you go
Gun in your holster ready to blow
(Uh oh)
There you go
Hunting me down like an animal
(Uh oh)
There you go
There you go 
There you go...

I don't wanna be ya, see ya, hear ya
You're a heartkiller
I don't wanna feel ya, can't be near ya
You're a heartkiller
A murderer
Serial lover
I don't wanna be ya, see ya, hear ya
You're a heartkiller

Caution tape the door
Chalk lines on the floor
If I let you in, no
I'll never become
Victim to your touch
Damaged by your love love love...

I don't wanna be ya, see ya, hear ya
You're a heartkiller
I don't wanna feel ya, can't be near ya
You're a heartkiller
A murderer
Serial lover
I don't wanna be ya, see ya, hear ya
You're a heartkiller...
You're a heartkiller...
You're a heartkiller...
