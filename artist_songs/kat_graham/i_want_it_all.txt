I want it all
And nothing's gonna hold me back
Kat Graham
I want it all

Don't know who you think I am
Don't need you watch
Go keep your benz
Got me saying, go take a walk
Cause boys just talk, talk, talk
Don't need 'em cause I got my own
Rings, bling, cars, clothes
Independat, don't forget it
Anything I want I get it

I'm the kind of girl
Who's gonna let you know
That yes I got it
I'm the kind of girl
Who's always in control
And I cant deny that

I want it all
And nothing's gonna hold me back
I want it all
I'm gonna take what I want
Nothing's gonna stand on my way
That's why I'm
Putting you on notice
Everything and no less
I want it all

When will men wake up and get it
Love don't cost what's on your credit
Yeah I've said it
Don't forget it
If you ain't know, well now you wit it
Film screen, limousine
Cover of a magazine
Pa-pa-ra-zzi
Nothing stops me

I'm the kind of girl
Who's gonna let you know
That yes I got it
I'm the kind of girl

Who's always in control

And I cant deny that

I want it all
And nothing's gonna hold me back
I want it all
I'm gonna take what I want
Nothing's gonna stand on my way
That's why I'm
Putting you on notice
Everything and no less
I want it all

If you wanna, I can take you
Where you never
Ever been before
And make you
Gonna make you lose
Your mind

If you wanna, I can take you
Where you never
Ever been before
And make you
Gonna make you lose
Your mind

I'm the kind of
I'm the kind of

Gonna make you

I'm the kind of
I'm the kind of

Gonna make you

I want it all
And nothing's gonna hold me back
I want it all
I'm gonna take what I want
Nothing's gonna stand on my way
That's why I'm
Putting you on notice
Everything and no less
I want it all
