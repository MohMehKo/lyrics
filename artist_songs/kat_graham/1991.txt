Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh

You love me when I'm wild and even when I'm crazy
But ain't that the way it's supposed to be
And even when you're mad and just a little cranky, yeah
Boy, you still get the best of me

If you want it, give it on up
And if you need it, give it on up
You gotta have it, give it on up
Just say, "Give it to me, baby"
Come on

I can't give up, we'll never be over
Every break up only brings us closer, boy
Old school lovin' like we're from 1991
Take it back so much, we're back in 1991

I'll give you all my time and even all my money (all my money)
As long as you stay good to me (to me, to me, to me)
Cause even when your boys are acting kinda funny, yeah
You know you can still come home to me

If you want it, give it on up
And if you need it, give it on up
You gotta have it, give it on up
Just say, "Give it to me, baby"
Come on

I can't give up, we'll never be over
Every break up only brings us closer, boy
Old school lovin' like we're from 1991
Take it back so much, we're back in 1991

I give you all my love and yes, I give it all the time
Everyone I know knows that the boy is mine, yeah
Ain't no question his heart's in my hands
If you can't tell take a look at his pants
I've been around the block ain't no other like
This make up sex so good I go, yeah
Can't let go girls, he's the one
I take him back like 1991

I can't give up, we'll never be over
Every break up only brings us closer, boy
Old school lovin' like we're from 1991
Take it back so much, we're back in 1991

I can't give up, we'll never be over
Every break up only brings us closer, boy
Old school lovin' like we're from 1991
Take it back so much, we're back in 1991
