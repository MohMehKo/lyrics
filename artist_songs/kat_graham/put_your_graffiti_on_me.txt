Denim-jean jacket, pink Chucks
And a mini skirt.
Be your bad habit
Throw me up against the wall first.
I take advantage of you
You take advantage of me.
Drink up this bottle again,
And paint your body on me.

[Hook]
Put Your Graffiti On Me! [x3]
Tag me! [x2]
Put your name on it! Put your, put your name on it! [x4]

Cotton-candy, lollipop
Sticky like a post-it.
You don't need to drum my heart,
You already own it.
I take advantage of you,
You take advantage of me.
Drink up this bottle again,
And paint your body on me.

[Hook]
Put Your Graffiti On Me! [x3]
Tag me! [x2]
Put your name on it! Put your, put your name on it! [x4]

[Bridge]
Treat me like concrete under your feet.
I'll be your 'canvas incomplete.'
Your paper-doll, 
Your alley wall heart in Graffiti

Tag me! [x2]

[Hook]
Put Your Graffiti On Me! [x6]
Put your name on it! Put your, put your name on it! [x4]
Tag me! [x2]
