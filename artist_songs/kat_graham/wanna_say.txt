Tonight I'm gonna
Throw my past away
Tonight I'm gonna
Live like my last day
It makes wanna say...

When your around
I can tell
I'm about to lose myself
I'm about to lose myself
Caught up in
The moment again
Boy you take my breath away
Boy you take my breath away

I don't care 
If people wanna stop and stare
We'll just pretend
That no ones there
They'll fade away
Boy you make me wanna say 
Wanna say...

Tonight I'm gonna
Throw my past away
Tonight I'm gonna
Live like my last day
It makes wanna say...

YA YA YA
YA YA YA
It makes me wanna say...
YA YA YA
YA YA YA
It makes me wanna say...
YA YA YA
It makes me wanna say...
YA YA YA
It makes me wanna say...

From here on out
We'll live out loud
You and me against the world
You and me against the world
Don't matter how
Things turn out
Baby we're together now
Baby we're together now

I don't care 
If people wanna stop and stare
We'll just pretend
That no ones there
They'll fade away
Boy you make me wanna say 
Wanna say...

Tonight I'm gonna
Throw my past away
Tonight I'm gonna
Live like my last day
It makes wanna say...

YA YA YA
YA YA YA
It makes me wanna say...
YA YA YA
It makes me wanna say...
YA YA YA
It makes me wanna say...
YA YA YA
It makes me wanna say...

YA YA YA
YA YA YA
It makes me wanna say...
YA YA YA
It makes me wanna say...
YA YA YA
It makes me wanna say...
YA YA YA
It makes me wanna say...

Tonight I'm gonna
Throw my past away
Tonight I'm gonna
Live like my last day
It makes wanna say...
