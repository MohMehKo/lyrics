You're gonna let me rock it for you

Sometimes we just work
Sometimes we need space
Sometimes we just need to get up out each others face
'Times I'm feelin', like sometime, were running in place
But you really oughta know

That I would do anything for you
If you would just stop it and be cool
Cause sometimes I just need time to be doin' my thing
Don't you take it so personal
Don't I say I love you
Don't I say I care, yeah
Don't I say I'm with you, boy
Fact that I'm not going anywhere

Be good, it's so good, boy I got this
Be good, it's so good, let me rock this
We good, it's so good, so let's drop it
Cause I told you I ain't going anywhere

Sometimes people change, sometimes people don't
Sometimes people live and last but I'm the kind that won't
Sometimes it feels like sometimes we get in our own way
But you really gotta know

That I would do anything for you
If you would just stop it and be cool
Cause sometimes I just need time to be doin' my thing
Don't you take it so personal
Don't I say I love you
Don't I say I care, yeah
Don't I say I'm with you, boy
Fact that I'm not going anywhere

Be good, it's so good, boy I got this (I got this)
Be good it's so good let me rock this (rock it rock baby)
We good it's so good, so let's drop it (lets drop it)
Cause I told you I ain't going anywhere

Gotta hit me with I love you, I'm standing in front
You ain't going nowhere
Gotta hit me when I love you, I'm standing in front
Ain't going nowhere
Gotta hit me with I love you, I'm standing in front
You ain't going nowhere
Gotta hit me when I love you, I'm standing in front
Ain't going nowhere

Don't I say I love you
Don't I say I care, yeah
Don't I say I'm with you, boy
Fact that I'm not going anywhere (I'm still here)

Be good, it's so good, boy I got this (boy I got this)
Be good, it's so good, let me rock this (gonna let me rock it for ya)
We good, it's so good, so let's drop it (oh lets drop it)
Cause I told you I ain't going anywhere
