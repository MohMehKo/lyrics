I'm... just a little tongue tied
Just a little shy, for you
Sink... into your reflection
Cause I get weak, for you

It's love... till you break my heart
Give it all to me
It's love... till we fall apart
Give it all to me

You give me that kinda love
That takes me beyond and above
You know I can't get enough of
You

You give me that kinda love
That takes me beyond and above
You know I can't get enough of
You

Baby, baby, baby...

You... you get a little quiet
But I know you're feeling it too
No... no don't you fight this
Cause I get to confide in you, I need to confide it in you

It's love... till you break my heart
Give it all to me
It's love... till we fall apart
Give it all to me

You give me that kinda love
That takes me beyond and above
You know I can't get enough of
You

You give me that kinda love
That takes me beyond and above
You know I can't get enough of
You

Baby, baby, baby...

You've, got, all this love
Right where you want it, whenever you want it
You've, got my, porcelain heart
Baby don't drop it, baby don't drop it

You give me that kinda love
That takes me beyond and above
You know I can't get enough of
You

You give me that kinda love
That takes me beyond and above
You know I can't get enough of
You

Baby, baby, baby...
