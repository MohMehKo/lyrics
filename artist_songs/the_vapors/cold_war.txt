Little white dogs in black and chains 
Screaming indignation at your high class games 
Till the lights go out 
Shut your eyes and go back home 

Cramped and shocked in leather jeans 
Stoning priests and virgins 'cos they're much too clean 
for your new machine 
Shut your eyes and go back home 

Cause you’ve been sitting up all night long 
Lying in wait where you don’t belong 
Shooting up strangers 
And I’ve been covering up for you 
Making up songs you can see right through 
Someone’s in danger, think I'm in danger 

You play left handed for the revolution 
You over-estimate the quick solution 
But you’ll get there soon 
Get ready for another Cold War 
Another Cold War Oh oh 
Another Cold War 
Another Cold War Oh oh Oh Oh 

But you get let down 
when you ask for more 
but you rescued me 
So I won't stop this automatic fire 

Cause you’ve been sitting up all night long 
Lying in wait where you don’t belong 
Shooting up strangers 
And I’ve been covering up for you 
Making up songs you can see right through 
Someone’s in danger, think I'm in danger 

Is this a military state 
Is this a military state I’m in 
[repeat]
