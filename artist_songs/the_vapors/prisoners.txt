There's someone banging on my wall
I turn the volume up to full
I don't know who it is
Or why they don't like me
I don't feel safe in the street

There's something nagging in my head
I turn my body out of bed
I draw the curtains on another brand new day
Mrs. Jones and friend just look away

I'm prisoner number one
I won't get parole
'cause I carry a gun

Prisoner number one
Prisoner number one

We're all prisoners
We're all prisoners
We're all prisoners here

Last thing I remember Tuesday night
Is three white wonders waiting for a fight
Mrs. Jones walked by me as I lay there on our street
She knows I'm a black boy underneath

I'm prisoner number one
I won't get parole
'cause I carry a gun

Prisoner number one

Prisoner number one

We're all prisoners
We're all prisoners
We're all prisoners here

We're all prisoners
Always caught
In the life and death of each other's thoughts

I'm prisoner number one (Oh-oh)
Prisoner number one (Oh-woah-oh)
Prisoner number one (Oh-oh)
Prisoner number one

I'm prisoner number one
I won't get parole
'cause I carry a gun

Prisoner number one
Prisoner number one

We're all prisoners
We're all prisoners
We're all prisoners here

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
