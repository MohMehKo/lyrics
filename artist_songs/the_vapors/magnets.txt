The motorcade is never-ending
The marshalls wave their wheel appeal
Only some of them are breathing
Only some know what to feel

The generals grit their teeth and smile
Just for a little while
Until they think they can't be seen
Then pour contempt through eyes that seem like magnets
Small and hard
Magnets

They rolled away down through the arches
The wet streets shined confetti-lined
The sun burns everything it touches
The motorcade dissolves the mind

The madman grits his teeth and smiles
Just for a little while
As though he knows he can't be seen
Then pours contempt through eyes that seem like magnets
Small and hard
Just like magnets
Out of the crowd
Just like magnets
Kennedy's children all magnets

Waste of time at the Alamo
All the kids singing "Go Johnny, go Johnny, go!"
All the cars parked out of view
And someone on a roof with a job to do

But the hotdogs sell and the cameras roll
It's a star situation, but it's out of control
There's a man with a message and it's written on lead
There's a man who is god, but god is dead

Still we grit out teeth and smile 
Just for a little while
As though we think we can be seen
We pour contempt through eyes that seem like magnets
Small and hard
Just like magnets
Out of a crowd 
Just like magnets
Kennedy's children all magnets
Magnets staring up 
Just like magnets
Burning the sky
Just like magnets
Kennedy's children all magnets

Magnetized boys, boys, boys
