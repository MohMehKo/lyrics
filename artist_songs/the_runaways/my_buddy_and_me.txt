My buddy and me don't want to be like the rest so don't make us 
My buddy and me we're so crazy no one can take us 
We take everything we do in stride 
We won't conform society don't take our side 

My buddy and me don't care what you think you can shove it 
My buddy and me have to be on our own and that's final 
Don't try to stick us in no mold 
Cause we won't fit, no matter what we're told 

We wanna be alone 
We won't get down on our knees 
And neither should you 

Leave us alone 
We won't get down on our knees 
And neither should you 

My buddy and me we say it's do or die we believe it 
My buddy and me we're made of good stuff won't take shit 
We gotta do what we feel is best 
We think you're confused we're not like the rest 

We wanna be alone 
We won't get down on our knees 
And neither should you 
Leave us alone 
We won't get down on our knees 
And neither should you 

My buddy and me don't want to be like the rest so don't make us 
My buddy and me we're so crazy no one can take us 
We take everything we do in stride 
We won't conform society don't take our side 

We wanna be alone 
We won't get down on our knees 
And neither should you 
Leave us alone 
We won't get down on our knees 
And neither should you
