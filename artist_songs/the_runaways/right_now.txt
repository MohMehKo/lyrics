I look for your face in every crowd 
I know you're with me in every town 
I still can feel you a thousand miles away 
I got no doubt this magic will stay 

Right now, I wanna be with you 
Right now, I wanna feel you and touch you 
Right now, I gotta see you just one more time 
Right now, I wanna lay with you 
Right now, I wanna reach out and hold you 
Right now, I gotta play with you one more time 

I look in you eyes and see my heart 
I touch your hand and I know we can't part 
My feelings for you keep going on strong 
I know with you there is no wrong 

Right now, I wanna be with you 
Right now, I wanna feel you and touch you 
Right now, I gotta see you just one more time 
Right now, I wanna lay with you 
Right now, I wanna reach out and hold you 
Right now, I gotta play with you one more time 

Right now 
Right now 
Right now 

All of those good times when we're at play 
There's so much inside me there's so much to say 
It's only for me and I know my place 
People know you put a smile on my face 

Right now, I wanna be with you 
Right now, I wanna feel you and touch you 
Right now, I gotta see you just one more time 

Right now, I wanna be with you 
Right now, I wanna reach out and hold 
Right now, I gotta play with you one more time 

Right now, I wanna be with you 
Right now, I wanna feel you and touch you 
Right now, I gotta see you just one more time
