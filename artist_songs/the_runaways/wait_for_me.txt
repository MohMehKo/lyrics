Don't wanna leave you again baby
But ya know I have to someday
Don't wanna be alone again baby
But I know we found our own way
We hold ourselves together
It's a bond that can never be broken
I know we'll last forever
But there's something that I just gotta say

Wait for me my lover
Wait for me no other
Stay with me, oh please
Wait for me

You know it's really hard on me
To have to turn an' wave good-bye
An' I know it's hard on you too
All those lonely nites we cry but

Wait for me my lover
Wait for me no other
Stay with me, oh please
Wait for me

You know I get so scared inside
When I come back you won't want me
But then you tell me I'm your only one
I guess it's just my insecurity but

Wait for me my lover
Wait for me no other
Stay with me, oh please
Wait for me
