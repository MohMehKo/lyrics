Let me out of your iron grip 
I don't want your lover's tips 
I don't need your interrogations 
Don't ask me 'bout my other relations 

You're too possessive for me 
So leave me alone 
Get off my back, go on home 
You're too possessive for me 
So get out of my life 
Get off my back, I ain't your wife 

I come in late an' you throw a fit 
You sit me down and give me some lip 
Well I don't have to waste my time 
A wimp like you ain't worth a dime 

You're too possessive for me 
So leave me alone 
Get off my back, go on home 
You're too possessive for me 
So get out of my life 
Get off my back, I ain't your wife 
No way, baby 

Go away an' don't come back 
I don't want my mirror cracked 
Go and find somebody new 
Got no time to mess with you 

You're too possessive for me 
So leave me alone 
Get off my back, go on home 
You're too possessive for me 
So get out of my life 
Get off my back, I ain't your wife 
No way, baby
