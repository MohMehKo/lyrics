Little Sister on your rollerskates 
It's Friday nite an' you got a date
Right in front of the Watergate.
But now he's gone 'cause you're too late

It's too late to be a kid in love
It's too late to be a kid in love
We're the kids in hate

Little sister you're sure lookin' great
You hope someday you'll be playmate
Well why did you wait
Your chance is gone an' now you're too late

It's too late to be a kid in love
It's too late to be a kid in love
We're the kids in hate

Little sister don't you be so straight
Let your old folks call ya jailbait
This mean world it belongs to us
It can be yours so don't hesitate(c'mon)

It's too late to be a kid in love
It's too late to be a kid in love
We're the kids in hate
