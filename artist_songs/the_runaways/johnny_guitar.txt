I got myself a bad lover
His name is Johnny Guitar lookout

Go for it Johnny
All night long
Go for it Johnny
That's where I'm coming from

My fingers roll his body
Making him scream
And I'm lost in a metal dream

Go for it Johnny
All night long
Go for it Johnny
That's where I'm coming from

Hot hands on his wet neck
I'm a hunter he's my gun

Go for it Johnny
All night long
Go for it Johnny
That's where I'm coming from
