Used to be the trouble maker
Hated homework, was a sweet heartbreaker 
But now I have my dream 
I'm so rowdy for eighteen 
Never read a single book 
Hated homework and the dirty looks 
Now I live my life 
There's a lot I seen at eighteen 

School days, school days 
I'm older, now what will I find 
School day, school days 
Starting to slip I'm losin' my mind 

Used to be the wild one 
Hated class only lived for fun 
I'm mean an' got my schemes 
At the crazy age of eighteen 

Never made the honor roll 
Hated rules what I was told 
Now I am almost free 
It's a dangerous scene when you're eighteen 

School days, school days 
I'm older, now what will I find 
School day, school days 
Starting to slip I'm losin' my mind
