Good mornin' sunshine feels like Hollywood 
Got lipstick traces of famous Hollywood 
And in my school I'm like the legend of Hollywood 
Mama says I'm much too good for the neighborhood 

Hollywood wish I could 
They say I'm too young to dream 
But I see your treasures in my magazines 
Hollywood wish I could 

Good evening moonlight feels like Hollywood 
Got the kinda face that would be loved in Hollywood 
On my television I get news from Hollywood 
Daddy says I'm much too good for the neighborhood 

Hollywood wish I could 
They say I'm too young to dream 
But I see your treasures in my magazines 
Hollywood wish I could 

Don't want the heartbreak and the pain 
Nor the fortune and the fame 
All my friends are still in school 
The ones I've lost say I'm a fool 
Yes, I'm a fool, I'm a fool 

Hollywood wish I could 
They say I'm too young to dream 
But I see your treasures in my magazines 
Hollywood wish I could 

Hollywood wish I could 
They say I'm too young to dream 
But I see your treasures in my magazines 
Hollywood wish I could 

Hollywood I wish I could 
They say I'm too young to dream 
But I see your treasures in my magazines 
Hollywood wish I could
