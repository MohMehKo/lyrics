I think the Russian's got a weather machine 
I think they're planning a takeover scheme 
Doin' a good job on our countryside 
They want to be our friends, but it's an obvious lie 

They buried New York and they drowned L.A. 
Sometimes I wonder if I'll see the next day 
I know the Russian's are behind this shit 
No ones goin' to know it until it's too late 

Takeover they're taking over 
How long till they get everyone 
Takeover they're taking over 
How can we be so dumb 

They asked us for our help to rip China down 
They want to rule every city want to rule every town 
I can't stand the thought of what might happen to us 
I get so confused I don't know who I can trust 

Takeover they're taking over 
How long till they get everyone 
Takeover they're taking over 
How can we be so dumb
