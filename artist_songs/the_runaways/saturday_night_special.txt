Let's talk about women 
Let's talk about love 
Let's talk about bitchin' 
And the comin' I've done 
I live for the weekend 
It's part of the script 
You pray for an angel 
Well, hey this is it 

You can dress me in ribbons 
You can tie me in knots 
You get out the camera 
Provocative shots 
You do what you want to 
Let's see what you've got 
And if I don't like it 
I'll just tell you to stop 

She's a Saturday night special (Saturday night) 
A two two caliber bore 
She's a Saturday night special (Saturday night) 
You caught me dreamin' before 
She's a Saturday night special (Saturday night) 
I'm young and easily bored 
She's a Saturday night special (Saturday night)
And you know I'm kinda special
And you know that you'll be back for more 

You want to respect me 
How long will that last 
You want to protect me 
I don't need it you jerk 
I'm lookin' for action 
I'm hungry and hot 
You want to know why 
That's easy why not 

She's a Saturday night special (Saturday night) 
A two two caliber bore 
She's a Saturday night special (Saturday night) 
I saved my acceptable score 
She's a Saturday night special (Saturday night) 
I'm young and easily bored 
She's a Saturday night special (Saturday night) 
And you know I'm kinda special 
And I know that you'll be back for more 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, Saturday night

Yeah, yeah, yeah, Saturday night 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Saturday night
