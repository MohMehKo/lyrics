Mother and father came from New York City 
Working their life away 
Know they'll give me anything 
That a little girl needs to make my life pretty 

Seen you before but you're making me sore 
But I'm trying not to make a sound 
Couldn't help notice you were wanting me 
You said I can help you make your life pretty 

Oh, baby I'm a million, oh yeah 
Oh, baby I'm a million 

You like to mess around with your favorite guns 
I hope you blow yourself to hell 
Cause I've the need honey I got the greed 
Just to make my life a little more pretty 

Oh, baby I'm a million, oh yeah 
Oh, baby I'm a million
