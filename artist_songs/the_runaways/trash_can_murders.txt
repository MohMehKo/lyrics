You've got me runnin' round in circles
Tied my little brothers to a railroad track
In the black of the night you sit and pant
Crammed them all together in a plastic bag
You're a night prowler, you're a night howler, yeh

Trash can murders
In the black of night
Trash can murders
When will it be alright

Walk the streets and you're dressed in black
You tied their hands behind their backs
That's cold yeh, ya know it's true
Just wait and see what happens to you
You're a night prowler, you're a night howler, yeh

Trash can murders
In the black of night
Trash can murders
When will it be alright

I can hear him scream, it's midnight
In the alley like a Chinese cat
I've got a hatchet gonna take your life
Oh yeh, tell me, what ya think of that
I'm a night prowler, I'm a night howler yeh

Trash can murders
In the black of night
Trash can murders
When will it be alright
