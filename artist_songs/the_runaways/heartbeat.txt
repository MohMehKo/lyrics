Thousands cheered as you appeared
The band was playing
We drove away that Saturday
I wanted you knew where you were staying
Backstage lied about my age
Didn't care that you were older

Stop look listen to my heartbeat
Stop look listen to my heartbeat

Here you are a superstar
But I sing and play in my own way
You got your fans and I got mine
But I need your love that's the bottom line
I sing lead and so do you
Get together what will we do?

Stop look listen to my heartbeat
Stop look listen to my heartbeat

Danced all night till the room was light
You said goodbye I wondered why
Radio played you couldn't stay
You'd miss your plane in the morning rain
Here I am in the limousine
Once again the lonely queen

Stop look listen to my heartbeat
Stop look listen to my heartbeat
