When the moon is out it starts to shine
Thunder crashes want to make you mine
The sky lights up in my mind
Fireworks between us you'll find

And its thunder
The spell that I'm under
It's thunder
I see lightning crash
And its thunder
Oh how our love flashes
It's thunder
Don't need no other feeling

All the others their just the same
But oh my baby your a hurricane
Let me be your battered angel
So you can be my tattered devil

And its thunder
The spell that I'm under
It's thunder
I see lightning crash
And its thunder
Oh how our love flashes
It's thunder
Don't need no other feeling

Your my teenage fire
That's in my heart
Now our flaming love is gonna start
Oh its gonna start
