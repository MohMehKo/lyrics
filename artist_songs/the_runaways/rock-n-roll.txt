(It's all right)
(It's all right)
(It's all right)

All right!
Whoo!

Ginni said when she was five years old
You know there's nothing going down at all
She turned on that radio 
And there was nothing happenin' at all
She turned on that LA station
Couldn't believe what she heard at all
She started dancing to that fine fine music
Her life was saved by rock and roll

Despite all the complications
You could just dance to that rock and roll station
And it was all right (it's all right)
It was all right (it's all right)
It was all right (it's all right)
Yeah, it was all right (it's all right)
You betcha
Whoo!

Ginni said when she was five years old
You know our parents will be the death of us all
Two TV sets and two Cadillac cars
Well they don't mean nothin' at all
She turned on that LA station
Couldn't believe what she heard at all
She started dancin' to that fine fine music
Her life was saved by rock and roll 

Despite all the complications
You could just dance to that rock and roll station
And it was all right (it's all right)
Said it was all right (it's all right)
Said it was all right (it's all right)
It was all right, (it's all right)
All right!
Whoo!
Ow!

Despite all the complications
You could just dance to that rock and roll station
And it was all right (it's all right)
And it was all right (it's all right)
And it was all right (it's all right)
Yeah, it was all right, (it's all right)
Said it was all right!
