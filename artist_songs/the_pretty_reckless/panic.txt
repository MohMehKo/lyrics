You are driving me into manic.
You can't break me out of my habits.
I never will be you, I hate that you're breathing.
So leave me alone, I'm an addict.

You never will see it my way.
I'm draining the light from your day.
You're pushing, you're pushing, I'm pulling you down.

Baby, spare yourself (But I'm in love with you)
No, I won't take your help (But I will see it through)
I am too far gone for you to bring me back so baby, spare yourself.

You are driving me into panic.
I know that you can't understand it.
I'm constantly sinking, I'm no longer thinking.
So leave me alone when I'm frantic.

You never will feel it my way.
I'm draining the light from your day.
You're pushing, you're pushing, I'm pulling you down.

Baby, spare yourself (But I'm in love with you)
No, I won't take your help (But I will see it through)
I am too far gone for you to bring me back so baby, spare yourself.

(Oh, oh, oh, oh...)

Baby, spare yourself from all my trouble 'cause
I won't take your help; I'm not the girl I was.
I am too far gone for you to bring me back
Baby, spare yourself.
