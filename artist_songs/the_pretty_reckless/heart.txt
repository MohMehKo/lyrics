Never wanted to feel
Never wanted you to steal my heart
Never wanted to know
Never wanted to show I'm weak

I'm falling all over myself
Trying to be someone else
I wish you would dare to walk me home
So I wouldn't have to feel alone

Always wanted to be
Always wanted you to see my heart
Always wanted your love
Always wanted but never was

I'm falling all over myself
Trying to be someone else
I wish you would dare to walk me home
So I wouldn't have to feel alone

I'm falling all over myself
Dying to be someone else
I wish you would dare to walk me home
I don't wanna fight the world alone

Never told you before
Never loved you more

I'm falling all over myself
Trying to be someone else
I wish you would dare to walk me home
So I wouldn't have to feel alone

I'm falling all over myself
Dying to be someone else
I wish you would dare to walk me home
I don't wanna fight the world alone
I don't wanna fight the world alone
I don't wanna fight the world alone
