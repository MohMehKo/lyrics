Take a piece of my life
Take a piece of my soul
Take a piece of my face
So I can never grow old

And take a piece of my world
Take a piece of my heart
Take a piece of my brain
So I can never be smart

Everybody wants to see me down
Leave my body on the dirty ground
Everybody wants

I want you to abuse me, use me, shut up and do me
'Cause everybody wants something from me
Grab me, stab me, go on and have me
'Cause everybody wants something from me
Everybody wants something from me

Take a drink of my drink
Take a drag on my drag
Take a shot of the good
And take a pill for the bad

Take your momma's advice
So you can do what is right
Take a knife to the bed
Take a gun to the fight

Everybody wants to see me down
Everybody wants

I want you to abuse me, use me, shut up and do me
'Cause everybody wants something from me
Grab me, stab me, go on and have me
'Cause everybody wants something from me
Everybody wants something from me

Break me, take me
C'mon and make me
'Cause everybody wants

Abuse me, use me, shut up and do me
'Cause everybody wants something from me
Grab me, stab me, c'mon and have me
'Cause everybody wants something from me
Yeah, everybody wants something from me
