I don't have to leave anymore
Cause what I haves right here
Spend the nights and days before
Before

I am yours now
So I don't ever have to leave
I am yours now
I am yours now

If you stand there and watch me burn
It's alright because I like the way it hurts
If you stand there and make me cry
I don't mind because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Well I don't have to leave anymore
Cause all I haves right here
Spend the nights and days before
Before

I am yours now
So I don't ever have to leave
I am yours now
I am yours now

If you stand there and watch me burn
It's alright because I like the way it hurts
If you stand there and make me cry
I don't mind because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

If you stand there and watch me burn
It's alright because I like the way it hurts
If you stand there and make me cry
That's alright cause I love the way you lie

If you stand there and watch me burn
It's alright cause I love the way it hurts
And if you stand there and make me cry
Oh I don't mind cause I love the way you lie
