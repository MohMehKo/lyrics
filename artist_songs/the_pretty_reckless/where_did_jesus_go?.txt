I have a tale to tell about a girl whose soul was screwed
She was born into a life with everything to lose
Her father sold her to the trade when she was just a child
She was seventeen and never ever learned to smile

She took a bullet and she blew out her brains
She didn’t say goodbye, she just went away
And now who’s missing her? 
I wish she was here
Her name was Angel and she’d had a bad year

So you wanna call me the devil’s advocate
When you don’t know the half of it?
Cause I was raised to believe in miracles
My life is so cold

Where did Jesus go?
Where did Jesus go?
Where did Jesus go?
He disappeared

Where did Jesus go?
Where did Jesus go?
Where did Jesus go?
He disappeared

What’s the point of screaming out if no one gives a damn?
What’s the point of reaching out if no one lends a hand?
She had passed the point where there was nothing left to give
She was seventeen and never ever learned to live

So if you wanna call me the devil’s advocate
Well you don’t know the half of it
Cause I was raised to believe in miracles
My life is so cold

Where did Jesus go?
Where did Jesus go?
Where did Jesus go?
He disappeared

Where did Jesus go?
Where did Jesus go?
Where did Jesus go?
He disappeared

She needed an angel to love
And no one sent her an angel
She needed an angel to love her
But no one sent her an angel

But you wanna call me the devil’s advocate
But you don’t know the half of it
I hate I was raised to believe in miracles
Cause life is so cold

And if you wanna call me the devil’s advocate
But you don’t know the half of it
I hate I was raised to believe in miracles
Cause life is so cold

And where did Jesus go?
Where did Jesus go?
Where did Jesus go?
He disappeared

Where did Jesus go?
Where did Jesus go?
Where did Jesus go?
He disappeared
