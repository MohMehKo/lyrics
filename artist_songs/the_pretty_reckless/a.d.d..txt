I'm liking the color, I'm liking the bold
And I've got an attitude, you bet I'll be rude
I like getting crazy, I'm liking the toys
Yeah, I love loud noise

Am I making you nervous? Am I making you fear?
I know that your anxious, so come over here
And look at my makeup, play with my hair
Take a peek under

I'm young and I'm easily bored
Hey, hey, that's what the night is for
I've got add, so don't mess with me
'Cause I'm young and I'm easily bored
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Owww!

I live for excitment, do you live for the ride?
Let's kiss for your camera, and then I'll decide
I'm attracted to chaos, attracted to rage
And I might offend you

See, I like to play nice, so I can be rude
I might be too forward, did I tell you too soon?
That I like the sharade and I like to impose
Get me a drink

I'm young and I'm easily bored
Hey, hey, that's what the night is for
I've got add, so don't mess with me
'Cause I'm young and I'm easily bored

Ohhh Ohhh 
Don't ya, don't ya, don't ya, try to reason with me
Don't ya, don't ya, don't ya, try to reason with me
I'm drunk so now i'm easily bored
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Owww!

I'm young and I'm easily bored
Hey, hey, that's what the night is for
I've got add, so don't mess with me
'Cause I'm young and I'm easily bored

Love drunk, that's what the night is for
Love drunk, well I'm easily bored
So baby, 
Don't ya, don't ya, don't ya, try to reason with me
Don't ya, don't ya, don't ya, try to reason with me
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Owww!
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Owww!
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Owww!
