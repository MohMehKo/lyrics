Jump into the sun
Dear boy what are you running from
Everyone has got to be saved
I have heard a voice if it came down to make a choice
I would be the one whoâ€™s replaced

Time keeps rolling on
I need my
Time keeps rolling on
I need my Absolution

Run boy be a man
With legs too weak to make a stand
We're all crucified in the end
Can you hear a voice
Decipher it through all this noise
You'll be left with nothing again

Time keeps rolling on
I need my
[x3]
Time keeps rolling on
I need my Absolution 

Jump into the sun
Dear boy what are you running from
The answer you will find in your grave

Time keeps rolling on
I need my
But time keeps rolling on
I need my Absolution

[x2]
Time keeps rolling on
I need my Absolution

[x3]
Boys on the outside of heaven
But I could be wrong
