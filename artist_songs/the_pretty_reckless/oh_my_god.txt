Oh my God, wish I was thin
Wish I was a normal human being
I'm just like them
Stuck in the dirt
I am a victim of my own self-worth

And now I wanna take it back
I wanna take it back
I wanna take it back
To when I was so dumb and so innocent

Oh my God, wish I was black
Wish I had soul and my music attacked
I am so white, shine like the sun
Just like with Eve count it down to the one

And now I wanna take it back
I wanna take it back
I wanna take it back
To when I was so dumb and so innocent

Oh my God, wish I could think
Wish I could do something smarter than sing
But I'm just a face
Painted in mud
Don't try for perfect it's never enough

I'm just hanging with my head down
I'm just hanging with my head down
I'm just hanging with my head down
I'm just hanging with my head down

I wanna take it back
I wanna take it back
I wanna take it back
To when I was so dumb and so innocent

Oh my God, wish I was dead
Wish I could turn off the noise in my head
Oh my God, wish I could breathe
Enough air in my lungs to muster a scream
Oh my God, wish I was numb
The weight on my back didn't feel like a ton
Oh my God, wish I could pray
Believe in the words your religions all say
Oh my God, wish I could swim
Cause I'm gonna drown in depression again
