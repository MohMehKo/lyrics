[The Walls Are Closing In]

Get your shit together

There's no light
Mama, I can't see at all
There's no one left to break this fall
Mama, there's no one at all

[Hangman]

[Latin intro]
Semi tabellio prima
Retracto quemadmodum callum
Odi cimussiato bora
Victum calefia doleo
Mia esto nescienta
Lio rumen appello mama
Effascinatio crea
Tichius nova lumen patior
Esto mi doleo solor
Vivax olor ma infecta
Estar in mia altaria
Estur inomina montis

[English translation:
I first started to decompose
But I regained control I have thick skin
I hate the rope it's burning my skin
The food is burning my throat
I know it's ignorance
But I reject it, I can't keep it in my stomach mama
The human body fascinates me
The mark of the new light is devastating
And I know the pain is comforting me
Its intensity and smell disturbed me
He died by sacrifice
He died on the hill in a baneful way]

I don't know, won't get out alive, yeah

I think I am gonna spend my last night here
I think I can finally see clear

When they come to hang you
Stand straight
Brace your neck
Be stronger
When they come to hang you
And you think you lost control
Don't take your soul

[Latin post-chorus]
Sono o no ma infecta
Estar in mia altaria
Estur inonima montis

[English translation:
The noise of the wound disturbs me
He died by sacrifice
He died on the hill in a baneful way]

I don't know, won't get out alive, yeah

Time flies
By the rank of years
Humans die
By the hand of fear

When they come to hang you
Stand straight
Brace your neck
Be stronger
When they come to hang you
And you think you lost control
Don't take your soul

In the time of the light
Before humans had the sight
Spent my life living blind
With a picture in my mind
A vision of the sun
And now my life is done
As I wait for the light to come
I will take not a thing
For what would I bring
That won't decompose
As my body is disposed
And the earth weighs a ton
And now my life is done
As I wait for the light to come... to come

When they come to hang you
Stand straight
Brace your neck
Be stronger
When they come to hang you
And you think you've lost control
Don't take your...
And you think you've lost control
Don't take your soul
