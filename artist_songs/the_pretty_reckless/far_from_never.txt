I know I fucked up this time
Just give me one more try
I know you've made up your mind
So leave me here behind you

And all the things you've said
Made it harder to breathe
When I was lying on the floor
I couldn't believe you wouldn't save me
But you blame me

You cried, the fire just died
It's gone forever, and the chance to live our lives
It's gone forever, and where we stand tonight
It's where we stand tonight, so far from never

I know I messed with your mind
And wasted all your precious time
The more I try, the more I find that

All the things you've said
Made it harder to breathe
When I was lying on the floor
I couldn't believe you wouldn't save me
But you blame me

You cried, the fire just died
It's gone forever, and the chance to live our lives
It's gone forever, and where we stand tonight
It's where we stand tonight, so far from

No one will never let you down
(No one will never let you down)
No one will never let you down

No one will never let you down
(No one will never let you down)
No one will never let you down

'Cause the fire just died
It's gone forever, and the chance to live our lives
It's gone forever, and where we stand tonight
It's where we stand tonight, so far from never

So far from never

You said you'd never let me down
You said you'd never let me down
