I'm not listening to you
I am wandering right through existence
With no purpose and no drive
'Cause in the end we're all alive, alive

Two thousand years I've been awake
Waiting for the day to shake

To all of you who've wronged me
I am, I am a zombie
Again, again you want me to fall on my head
I am, I am, I am a zombie
How low, how low, how low will you push me
To go, to go, to go, before I lie down dead

Blow the smoke right off the tube
Kiss my gentle burning bruise
I'm lost in time
And to all the people left behind
You are walking dumb and blind, blind

And two thousand years I've been awake
Waiting for the day to shake

Dear all of you who've wronged me
I am, I am a zombie
Again, again you want me to fall on my head
I am, I am, I am a zombie
How low, how low, how low will you push me
To go, to go, to go, before I lie down dead
Oh dead, Oh dead, Oh dead

To all of you who've wronged me
I am, I am a zombie
Again, again you want me to fall on my head

I am I am I am a zombie
How low, how low, how low will you push me
To go, to go, to go, before I lie down dead
