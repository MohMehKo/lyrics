Back door bitches begging me to behold
All their cash and cars, platinum, silver 'n' gold
"We're like diamonds in the sky" that is what we are told
No mountain made of money can buy you a soul

I can see it [3x]
Coming down
I can see it [3x]
Coming down

It's a fucked up world
What do you get?
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
It’s a fucked up world
What do you get from it?
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette [2x]

Banging little boys bugging me on the bus
Say they want to know who did it but the answer's really us see
I don't know you, why do you want to know me?
You ain't getting what you want unless you're getting it for free

I can feel it [3x]
Coming down
I can feel it [3x]
Coming down

It's a fucked up world
What do you get?
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
It’s a fucked up world
What do you get from it?
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette [3x]

Back to these backdoor bitches begging me to behave
Jamming Jesus down my throat, no, I don't want to be saved
Ain’t a chain on my brain, I'm nobody's slave
I got one foot in the cradle and one in the grave

It's a fucked up world
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
It’s a fucked up world
What do you get from it?
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette [3x]

It's a fucked up world [11x]
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette [8x]
