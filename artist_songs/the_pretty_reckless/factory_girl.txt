I am a factory girl, won't you pardon me?
See I can make my whole world in a backseat
Lost point, want a joint, show me how to treat a john
Someone save me, save me from what I'm on

Wait a minute girl, can you show me to the party?
I said wait a minute girl, can you show me to the party?
Please let me in through the backdoor
Just let me in through the backdoor, baby
Just let me in through the backdoor, just let me in
Wait a minute girl, can you show me to the party?

It's gonna be a real good time

I'm waiting for my man and hollywood and vine, so fine
Been done in the alley, son I'm on New York time
Take a look at those red lights, green lights, blowin' my mind
I'll show you somethin' if you show me a good time

Wait a minute girl, can you show me to the party?
Wait a minute girl, can you show me to the party?
I'll let you in through the backdoor
I'll let you in through the backdoor, baby
I'll let you in through the backdoor, I'll let you in
Wait a minute girl, can you show me to the party?

Here she comes, coming around again
Here she comes, coming around again
Here she comes, coming around again
Here she comes, coming again

Wait a minute girl, can you show me to the party?
I said wait a minute girl, can you show me to the party?

Wait a minute girl, can you show me to the party?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute, hey girl, can you show me, girl?
Can you show me to the party? Can you show me to the party?
Can you show me to the party?
