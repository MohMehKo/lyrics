The night is when
The ghosts all come out
Playin’ with my head
Spin it all around
This room is like a prison cell
I'm all by myself
I'm waiting for my friend
To come and break me out

You left me today
Lyin’ on the floor
I wanted you to stay
Seems you wanted more
This bed is like a prison cell
Cause I'm all by myself
Still waiting for my friend
To come and break me out

And there's stone cold bars on my door
For this stone cold heart

Some people say
Life is like a lie
Take it day by day
Never knowing why
My head is like a prison cell
I'm all by myself
I'm waiting for my friend
To come and break me out
Still waiting for my friend
To come and break me out
