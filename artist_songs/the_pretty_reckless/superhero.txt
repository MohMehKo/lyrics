All alone again searchin for somethin'
There's no one left to save me now
I won't be afraid I just thought you'd catch me
But you're not here to save me now

I've had my share of criminals
And you're no different from them all

[Chorus]
I need a superhero cause I am just a girl
And I have no one who will go
And save me from this world
Come to me you superhero
Cause I am just a girl
I know cause you're no
Superhero

What did I expect I thought you'd help me
But I was crushed and beaten down

Yeah I've had my share of criminals
And you're no different from them all

[Chorus]
I need a superhero cause I am just a girl
And I have no one who will go
And save me from this world
Come to me you superhero
Cause I am just a girl
I know cause you're no
Superhero

[Bridge]
I'm hangin on the edge of the world
I'm clutching to a string
And my life is crumbling down

I need a superhero someone to save me
I need a superhero someone to save me

[Chorus]
I need a superhero  cause I am just a girl
And I have no one who will go
And save me from this world
Come to me you superhero
Cause I am just a girl
I know cause you're no superhero
