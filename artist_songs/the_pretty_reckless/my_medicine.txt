Somebody mixed my medicine [2x]

Well, you hurt where you sleep and you sleep where you lie
Now you're in deep and now you're gonna cry
Got a woman to your left and a boy to your right
You start to sweat so hold me tight 'cause...

Somebody mixed my medicine
I don't know what I'm on
Somebody mixed my medicine
Now, baby, it's all gone
Somebody mixed my medicine
Somebody's in my head again
Somebody mixed my medicine again, again

Well, I drink what you leak and I smoke what you sigh
See you 'cross the room with a look in your eye
Got a man to his left and a girl to his right
I start to sweat so hold me tight 'cause...

Somebody mixed my medicine
I don't know what I'm on
Somebody mixed my medicine
Now, baby, it's all gone
Somebody mixed my medicine
Somebody's in my head again
Somebody mixed my medicine again, again

There's a tiger in the room and a baby in the closet
Pour another drink, mom, I don't even want it
Then I turn around and think I see someone that looks like you

Well, you hurt where you sleep and you sleep where you lie
Now you're in deep and now you're gonna cry
Got a woman to your left and a boy to your right
You start to sweat so hold me tight 'cause...

Somebody mixed my medicine
I don't know what I'm on
Somebody mixed my medicine
Now, baby, it's all gone
Somebody mixed my medicine
Somebody's in my head again
Somebody mixed my medicine
Again [8x]

Somebody mixed my medicine [3x]
