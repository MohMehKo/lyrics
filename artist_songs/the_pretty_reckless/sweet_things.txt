Evil—knockin' at my door
Evil—making me its whore
I don’t mind
If you take what's yours but give me mine

Evil wants you to know
I'm much too young to be owned
I don’t mind
If you take what's yours but give me mine

Hey there, little girl
Come inside. I've got some sweet things
Put your hair in curls
Paint you up just like a drag queen

I don't mind decay
You are the night that saves my day

Hey there, little girl
Come inside, don't be afraid. I'll keep you safe

I'm evil knocking at your door
I'm evil making you my whore
I don’t mind
If you take what's yours but give me mine

[4x]
Hey where are you going?
I wasn't through
I'm gonna have my way with you

I am like decay
I rot the ground that guides your way, oh

Hey there, little girl
Come inside. I've got some sweet things
Put your hair in curls
Paint you up just like a drag queen

How you like me now?
Did I succeed and make you proud?

Hey there, little girl
Come inside, don't be afraid. I'll keep you safe
