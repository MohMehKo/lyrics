Alone, afraid, the kid your mother made
Sitting in your room drooling like a loser with all this doom
You think, then you start to drink
Then you get so paranoid with all the drugs they fill you with

Then boom
Does it make you feel like a man?
Boom
It's not the size we understand,
Boom
You think you're gonna get with me
You're never gonna get with me
You're never gonna dance with me

I admit, I feel like you, like shit
But I don't go 'round and take it out on everyone about it
We're all part of the system
You wanna start a war?
You think that anyone would listen?

Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?
Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?
Everybody's got one, there's nothing new about it
Wanna make a statement? You should've come without it

You turn the TV on, watch it if you dare
You see a politician and you start to pull your hair
But it's all two dimension see there's really nothing there
You wanna tell them what you think you think they fuckin' care

And boom
Do you think they hear you now?
And boom
Making noises in the crowd, all in the way that you're using
You love it so much then why do you abuse it?

Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?
Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?
Everybody's got one, there's nothing new about it
Wanna make a statement? You should've come without it

We're all part of the system
Load 'em up shoot 'em down
But you keep fucking missin'

We're all part of the system
Load 'em up shoot 'em down
But you keep fucking missing

Alone afraid you wanna make them pay thatâ€™s...

Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?
Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?
Everybody's got one, there's nothing new about it
Wanna get the girl? Then you should've come without it

Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?
Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?
Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?
Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?
