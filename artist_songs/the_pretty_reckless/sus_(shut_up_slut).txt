It’ll call you up
Don’t give it your number
Oops, too late
You took your black marker

Shut up slut, you love it
Shut up slut, you love it
Shut up slut, you love it

(Shut up slut, you love it)

Cause revenge ain’t gonna kill you, honey
Revenge is just gonna give you shit
And I told you because I found the reasons why you’re 
miserable
And it’s not my fault

Sorry sugar, you can’t fix this
I’d stop now if I were you
You screwed yourself
Kiss kiss, bitch
You’re the broken toy
I’m your glue

Shut up slut, you love it
Shut up slut, you love it
Shut up slut, you love it

Cause revenge ain’t gonna kill you, honey
Revenge is just gonna give you shit
And I told you because I found the reasons why you’re 
miserable
And it’s not my fault

Hate’s gonna hit on you
Hate’s gonna hit on you
Hate’s gonna hit on you
Hate’s gonna hit on you
Hate’s gonna hit on you
Hate’s gonna hit on you
Hate’s gonna hit on you
Hate is gonna hit on you

Cause revenge ain’t gonna kill you, honey
Revenge is just gonna give you shit
And I told you because I found the reasons why you’re 
miserable
And it’s not my fault
I told you because I found the reasons why you’re 
miserable
And it’s not my fault
