I'm bleeding blood out of a microphone,
Come watch me as I'm turning deaf to tone,
You're a self-righteous piece of dirt,
I wanna kick you where it hurts,
I'll bleed your blood out of a microphone.

[Pre-Chorus:]
Yeah, it's amusing how I'll hurt,
You call me reckless, don't you burn?
Oooh, I'm as twisted as I seem,
Don't you love me?

[Chorus:]
I lost my innocence,
Don't know where it went, baby,
Don't you love me?
Don't you love me?
Don't you love me, now!

Caffeine and cigarettes in hand,
How do you think that I can stand you running through my veins?

[Pre-Chorus]

I lost my innocence,
Don't know where it went, baby,
Don't you love me?
Don't you love me?
Don't you love me, now! (Don't you love me?)
Don't you love me, now!
(Don't you love me?)
Don't you love me?

No, I don't mean to, mean to make a speech,
You know they know, just look at me...
For a self-righteous piece of dirt, you've really learned how to make me hurt,
I'll hit reverse, I'll watch you burn! (Don't you love me?)

I lost my innocence,
Don't know where it went, baby,
Don't you love me?
don't you love me?

I lost my innocence,
Don't know where it went, baby,
Don't you love me?
Don't you love me?
Don't you love me, now?
(Don't you love me? [x2])
Don't you love me now?
Don't you love...

Don't you love me? [x7]
Don't you love me, now!
