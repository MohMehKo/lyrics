Been waitin' at these crossroads
Forever and a day
On a guy to buy my soul

I spend all night and day
How much harder can I play
You know I gave my life to Rock n' Roll

Here we go

Momma begged me please
Yes she got down on her knees
Said 'You'll burn in that Mississippi sun'
But I'm the only one that's standing here
So Mama don't you have no fear
Iâ€™m either last or I've already won..

Here I go

Take me down
Take me down
Take me down
Won't you take me down

Standing at the crossroads 
A dried up pen in hand
The conversation went like this
'Tell me your desire why you pulled me from the fire 
and we'll seal the deal with a kiss'
said 'I wanna raise the dead
Find a note that I can shred
On my walls I scrawl my gods
Don't care what happens when I die
As long as I'm alive
All I wanna do is rock, rock, rock!'

Take me down
Take me down
Take me down
Won't you take me down

Sign with the devil...

Take me down
Take me down
Take me down
Won't you take me down...
