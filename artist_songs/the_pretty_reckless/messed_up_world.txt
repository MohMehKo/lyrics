Back door bitches begging me to behold
All their cash and cars platinum silver and gold
We're like diamonds in the sky
That is what we are told
No mountain made of money
Can buy you a soul, baby

Ooh, I can see it
Ooh, I can see it
Ooh, I can see it
Coming down
Ooh, I can see it
Ooh, I can see it
Ooh, I can see it
Coming down
It's a messed up world, what do you get?
Sex & love and guns, light a cigarette
Messed up world, what do you get from it?
Sex & love and guns, light a cigarette
Sex & love and guns, light a cigarette

Banging little boys bugging me on the bus
Say they want to know who did it
But the answer's really us see
I don't know you, why do you want to know me?
You ain't getting what you want
Unless you're getting it for free, and baby

Ooh, I can feel it
Ooh, I can feel it
Ooh, I can feel it
Coming down
Ooh, I can feel it
Ooh, I can feel it
Ooh, I can feel it
Coming down

It's a messed up world, what do you get?
Sex & love and guns, light a cigarette
Messed up world, what do you get from it?
Sex & love and guns, light a cigarette

Sex & love and guns, light a cigarette
Sex & love and guns, light a cigarette
Uuuh, yeah

Back to these,
Back door bitches begging me to behave
Jamming Jesus down my throat
No I don't want to be saved
Ain't a chain on my brain
I'm nobody's slave
I got one foot in the cradle and one in the grave

It's a messed up world
Sex & love and guns, light a cigarette
Messed up world, what do you get from it?
Sex & love and guns, light a cigarette
Sex & love and guns, light a cigarette
Sex & love and guns, light a cigarette

IT'S A MESSED UP WORLD!
IT'S A MESSED UP WORLD!
IT'S A MESSED UP WORLD!
