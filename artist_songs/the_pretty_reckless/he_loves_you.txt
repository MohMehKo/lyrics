If he loves you and you believe,
Chicka chicka drip drop on you knees.
If he loves when your dead and gone,
Kissy kissy killer kitty play along.
But as for all inside your wounded soul,
He's never ever gonna let you go.
He's never ever gonna let you go.
He's never ever gonna let you go.

If he loves you,
He loves you not.
Be the one to leave him, baby don't get caught.
If he loves you,
He'll set your heart on fire.
Hate to be the one to tell you he's a liar.
If he loves you,
He loves you not.

So call him closer
Be a doll
He gives you just a taste
But you want it all
But if you stumble before you fall
Take a little taste or you'll lose it all

If he loves you,
He loves you not.
Be the one to leave him, baby don't get caught.
If he loves you,
He'll set your heart on fire.
Hate to be the one to tell you he's a liar.
If he loves you,
He loves you not.

Bet your wishin' for the day,
Wishin' and wish it all away,
Bet your wishin' for the day.

Well he loves you but he loves you not,
Be the one to leave him baby don't get caught.

Cause if he loves you,
He'll set you heart on fire.
Hate to be the one to tell you hes a liar.
If he loves you,
Then loves you not.
Be the one to leave him baby don't get caught.
Cause if he loves you,
Ohhh yeah if he loves you,
He loves you not.
