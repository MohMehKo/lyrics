I'm a prisoner
Won't you set me free
I'm a prisoner
Won't you set me free

You can have my body
But you can't have me

I know I'm a criminal
Don't you tell on me
I know I'm a criminal
Don't you tell on me

You can cross your fingers
But you can't cross me

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm a prisoner
Won't you set me free
I'm a prisoner
Don't you tell on me

You can have my money
Have me on my knees
You can have my body
But you can't have me
No, you can't have me
