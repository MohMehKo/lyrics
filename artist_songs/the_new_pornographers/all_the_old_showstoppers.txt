When John he saw the numbers he lied 
Made up the whole thing, failed when he tried 
To cash in on his cautious new fame 
Always the numbers but never the name 

We we hit the numbers we broke 
Broken and changed them changed as we spoke 
We knew that we would always be down 
Hitting the numbers spun way 'round 

And somebody beside you 
Slipped your head inside the crown 
The princes of the paupers 
And all the old showstoppers 
Till this moment's still unknown 

Sirens' songs have tried, too 
Yet, she takes you as her own 
The princes of the paupers 
And all the old showstoppers 
Till this moment's still unknown 

And when he got the numbers he thought 
Thought of his friends who slowed to a halt 
Who had questioned to no avail 
Some knew the answers, some wouldn't tell 

When Gabriel saw the numbers he fell 
Fell through the clouds into the great well 
But woke up before he hit the ground 
No one had noticed still he looked around 

And somebody beside you 
Slipped your head inside the crown 
The princes of the paupers 
And all the old showstoppers 
Till this moment's still unknown 

Sirens' songs have tried, too 
Yet, she takes you as her own 
The princes of the paupers 
And all the old showstoppers 
Till this moment's still unknown 

With her hand to guide you 
You are nothing if not home 
The princes of the paupers 
And all the old showstoppers 
Till this moment's still unknown
