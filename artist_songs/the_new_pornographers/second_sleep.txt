Been awake for awhile
Going deep, going long
Rising through what I keep
In the floats, what we found
Under glass, all the hours
Filled with hail-mary passes

It all sort of fastens to you
As you sleep

Been awake, thinking fast, cannot sleep
Second thoughts, second rate Socrates
[?] feeling flat, searching high
Left outside, like a [?]

At this time in the morning you'd swear it was night
It's another living proof of the use of lights on (lights on)...

Been awake for awhile...
