It's no secret why we're here
You can't keep it from it
In another moonless minute it's open wide

You hide secrets from them
You hide secrets but they're spent
All that kept the lights on when the power went

What's love?
What's love?
What's love?
What what turns up in the dark?

What's love?
What's love?
What's love?
What what turns up in the dark?

What turns up in the dark?
What turns up in the dark?

You can't see them in it
It gets weaker, watch them go
Wrap yourself around me in the shadow show

You hide secrets from them
They were the weakest ones we heard
Only when the lights were killed they sang that verse

What's love?
What's love?
What's love?
What what turns up in the dark?

What's love?
What's love?
What's love?
What what turns up in the dark?

What turns up in the dark?
What turns up in the dark?

What's love?
What's love?
What's love?
What what turns up in the dark?

What's love?
What's love?
What's love?
What what turns up in the dark?

What turns up in the dark?
What turns up in the dark?
