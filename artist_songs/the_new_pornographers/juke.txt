Been through here, crystal ball
You crashed, shattered into souls above you

There are rules here, into shapes
You can, can inform surrender

Juke you
Juke you
Juke you (Feels like the dawn took you out)

Juke you
Juke you
Juke you (Feels like the dawn took you out)

You pass through here, on the way, to come
Come to tell us all surrender
Some of you feel it has come to pass
At last, last September, you lost me

Juke you
Juke you
Juke you (Feels like the dawn took you out)

Juke you
Juke you
Juke you (Feels like the dawn took you out)

Took you out
Took you out
Took you out
Took you out

Took you out
Took you out
Took you out
Took you out

Been through here, some of you can
Underneath the world [?]
Been through here, crystal ball
You crashed, shattered into souls above me

Some of you
Some of you get life
Some of you
Some of you get life time
Some of you
Some of you will run
Some of you
Some of feel the strange cold
[?]
Some of you will run
Been accused
Some will take a lifetime

Juke you
Juke you
Juke you (Feels like the dawn took you out)

Juke you
Juke you
Juke you (Feels like the dawn took you out)

Took you out
Took you out
Took you out
Took you out

Took you out
Took you out
Took you out
Took you out

Juke you
Juke you
Juke you
Juke you

Juke you
Juke you
Juke you
Juke you
