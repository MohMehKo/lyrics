When you add your voice to bad choices
Then you're not-so-white becomes mannered
It's dripping down our walls like quicksilver
Dripping down us slowly as Saturn

And for you the cool surprise
Just step in, into traffic
Now you view new medicals
You broke through, your loving

We have found no use for the prophet
Searching for the doubts in our corners
With the ignorance of a poet
An unbreakable focus of mortars

Darling shade our shadows

Was it singing from the bad choices
On a ceiling without a pretext
When you give your mind to your voices
You accept the terms of your sentence

And for you the cruel surprise
The time slowed your walking
Now you view new medicals
You broke through, it's nothing

Darling shade our shadows

You can get declined when you tell her
Thinking you could learn a new language
Don't you want to turn a few favors
Since you left everybody hanging

Darling shade our shadows
