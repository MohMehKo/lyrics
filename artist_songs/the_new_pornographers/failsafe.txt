Ready to roll 
At the first glimpse of failsafe 
Signing my checks 
With a name that's not mine 

Locking the hours that's spent round through the tail end (?)

Scolding those hills ahead 
We both had a hand in it 

You and me both cared 
You and me both cared 

Raising a flag 
At the first sign of failsafe 
Another red flag and 
We've lost half the team 

I left the game 
To find you at the pavement 
Scolding those hills ahead 
We both had a hand in it 

You and me both cared 
You and me both cared 

Ooooh 
Ooooh 
Ooooh 

You and me both cared 
You and me both cared
