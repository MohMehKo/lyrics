Sweetheart, I was trapped in transit 
My lost ride 
When your wild eye wandered here lady 
Go out by the sweetheart tree 
But don't let go 
It's how my friend history here made me 

What's the weight of the world worth to ya, kid 
Go write down what you see 
And see how far it can go 
What's the weight of the world worth to your side 
Here is where you got lost 
And here is how you got by 

And here's the mutiny I promised you 
And here's the party it turned into 

Heartbeat, you abandoned searches 
Your lost ride 
You're in my lost country now lady 
Sweethearts in the crosstown wild 
You don't let go 
To the new live history goes with me 

What's the weight of the world worth to ya, kid 
Go write down what you see 
And see how far it can go 
What's the weight of the world worth to your side 
Here is where you got lost 
And here is how you got by 

And here's the mutiny I promised you 
And here's the party it turned into 
And here's the mutiny I promised you 
And here's the moment it turned into [x4]

Sweetheats on the green 
Flung pistols in high tide 
Move like my friend history here told me (?) 
Clear-skied when the clear eye opened 
My new moon to the new land 
Won't you come with me 

What's the weight of the world worth to ya, kid 
Go write down what you see 
And see how far it can go 
What's the weight of the world worth to your side 
Here is where you got lost 
And here is how you got by 

And here's the mutiny I promised you 
And here's the party it turned into 
And here's the mutiny I promised you 
And here's the moment it turned into
