Here come the fortune seekers
Backyard dreams that bleed their secrets
The fortune seekers
Spinning wheels in the sand
All out of body, out of hand
The plan to redirect the arc of time
Is spread out on the bedspread stained with wine

We'll hang some bells on your daylights and it's like they look brand new
Let's begin, let the fantasy fool the experts, too
What the hell, since we traveled so far from the future for you
Let's begin, let the fantasy fool the experts

Here come the fortune seekers
Using muscle memory, dreaming fever
The fortune seekers
What we wanted was deadly clear
We wanted rapture
Well, it's been here
The plan to launch a careful strategy
Is spread out on the bedspread carelessly

We'll hang some bells on your daylights and it's like they look brand new
Let's begin, let the fantasy fool the experts, too
What the hell, since we traveled so far from the future for you
Let's begin, let the fantasy fool the experts

You're gonna need your body
You're gonna need your body

We'll hang some bells on your daylights and it's like they look brand new
Let's begin, let the fantasy fool the experts, too
What the hell since we traveled so far from a the future for you
Let's begin, let the fantasy fool the experts
Let's begin, let the fantasy fool the experts

You're gonna need your body
