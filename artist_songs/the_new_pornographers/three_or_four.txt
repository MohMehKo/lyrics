Give me a home 
Where the past won't pay no mind 
In case i'm bringing my own 
Bring me a team of replacements 
Just in case the place I'm taking's my own own own 
Own own own 

Three or four hourglass 
Three or four hourglass 

Tell me I'm numb 
I'll be back in just a shake 
To see how my babies have grown 
Circle the chairs 
To protect us from the law 
In case you needed my own own own 
Own own own 

Three or four hourglass 
Three or four hourglass 
Three or four hourglass 
Oo oh... 
Three or four hourglass 
Three or four hourglass 
Three or four hourglass 
Three or four hourglass
