Look we've seen this kind of thing before.
Jackie threads with cobras at the door,
Dont live your life inside a letter,
Flirts with glances, you feel sick, you've had your chances, yes you've had 'em [echo]
On a chain, devouring the life, theres a kid going insane over her man, insane over her man, insane over her.

Look we've seen this kind of thing before,
Vulcans hanging from the entrance door, and if he hollers let him out because hes gonna shout, sees something in the way she moves that shouldnt be allowed.

Wrapped on the jungle floor, jackie's dressed in cobras, giving me ideas, what I really need now is ideas.

Look we've seen this kind of thing before.
Vampires drawn across the ballroom floor
The snake has blood thats squeezed for dancing, you felt sick you've had your chances, yes you've had 'em [echoes]

On a chain devouring the light
Theres a kid going insane over her man, insane over her man, insane over her.
On a chain devouring the light
Theres a kid going insane over her man, insane over her man, insane over her.
On a chain devouring the light
Theres a kid going insane over her man, insane over her man, insane over her.

Wrapped on the jungle floor, jackie's dressed in cobras
