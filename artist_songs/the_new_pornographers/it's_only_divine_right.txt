Both eyes
Drinking cool water
Not the first daughter
So i can't see
Why you're wrestling with words
At last
A tradition you've long outclassed

Come true
For the new martyrs
With your hair parted
Like the Red Sea
You're addressing the world from your bed
All alone in the crowd like you said

Come true
It's only divine right

Here's Leda
In her white glory
All her back-story
Has been wiped clean
Just another apocryphal mess
Never promised 'em anything less

So come true
These are safe waters
For the first daughter
So I can't see why
You're pushing the pull that you've had
While the rest of the girls go bad

Slip back
Through the plot
For the new shock
Seeing us then
When we were the real people

Face down
In the old money
Left the crowd
Wondering what your
Next move's gonna be
In the moments ahead
While the rest of the girls go bad
