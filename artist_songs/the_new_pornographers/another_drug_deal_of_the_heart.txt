We can't send it back
Pretend it's yours 'cause it will be
It will still be cracked
Are you sure we bought the right thrill here?
It's a drug deal of the heart

Don't meet me here
Just meet me out on that corner stop
I won't pay you here
Let's treat it more like being sworn enough
Like a drug deal of the heart

A drug deal of the heart
It's a drug deal of the heart
