One holy ghost for a home made girl
In a green T-shirt that read, i quote:
"what price damnation now?"

In the school of thought,
In the halls of state,
With a leap of faith,
The loose translation must have lost her

It must have caused her to go back...
To the civilization
Caught between here
And the real one
Just to say what you'd begun to say once

We have been enrolled in the wrong schools
All through the pride of fall
The falling price of education

There have been no clues in the last few takes
In the steps retraced

The education must have cost her
It must have caused her to go back
To the civilization caught between here
And the real one
Just to say what you'd begun to say once

The education must have cost her
The loose translation must have lost her
It must have lost her
Yeah
