You went looking for shelter 
In all the wrong spaces 
You grew gluttonous and famous with faces 
Nameless and blank 
Superstitiously you name them 
St. Christopher and Johanna 
St. Christopher and Johanna 
St. Christopher and Johanna 

Overcome with the holiday spirit 
Mark says the herald angels won't hear it 
And remember the wolves that you run with are wolves 
Don't forget 

They exist to give you something to regret, I'll beat them to it 
With something sadder than that brass portrait that shines through your morning din 
With something sadder than that brass portrait that shines through your morning din 

I'll give you something to be sad about 
Hey the picture really captures your mouth 
Poised to say: 
It's your turn to go down now, it's your turn to go down now 
It's your turn to go down now, it's your turn to go down now 
In the spirit of giving in 

Glad prayer Mary come on [repeated]
All I wanted was an answer to the secret 
Ground floor Mary come on 
Outboard Mary come on 
All I wanted was an answer to 
Your money or your life? Your money or your life? 
I was sick of America and her screaming decay 
I was in a band we were singing 'hooray' quite often 
But your momma was poor your daddy was poor 
Whatcha gonna do? 
Your mother was poor your father was poor 
Whatcha gonna do 
About it? 
Glad prayer Mary come on
