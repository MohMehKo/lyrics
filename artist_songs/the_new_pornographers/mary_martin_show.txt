With a map of the endtimes
I can follow a straight line
to the old Mary Martin Show.
Should we go?

Since we learned the guitar parts,
to the music that once started it off.

Mary Martin, they don't come any closer than that now. [x2]

With the musical guest on,
you were singing the theme song
to the old Mary Martin Show.
Did you know?

With your cameras in action,
with your network connections, it's go.

Mary Martin, they don't come any closer than that now.
Mary Martin, the hope of every actor in their role.

To aim far too, far too low. [x3]

All the rain on that morning
was so shiny and boring.

It was gold, Mary Martin, know
it was gold.
With a book of guitar chords,
some alright to good words, it sold.

Mary Martin, they don't come any closer than that now.
Mary Martin, the hope of every punchline that you throw.

To aim far too, far too low. [x3]

Lalalalala

Mary Martin, they don't come any closer than that now. [x3]
The Mary Martin Show [x2]
The Mary Martin, they don't come any closer, closer...
