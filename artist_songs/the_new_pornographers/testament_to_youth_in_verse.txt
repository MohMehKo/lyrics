Should you go lookin'
For a testament to youth in verse
Variations on the age old curse
You blame the stations
When they play you like a fool
And like a fool you get played with

Baby, think twice
Maybe it's not all
Maybe it's not alright

Finally a decent picture of the exodus
I don't know much
But other singers know less, and
Can we control ourselves for once?
Keep our hands off each other
Keep our minds on the sum
Of each other

Oh my sweet witness
Can't you hear the voices?
They're telling the children to rock
For their choices
The bells ring
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...
