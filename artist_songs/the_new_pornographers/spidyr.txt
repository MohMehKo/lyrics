So you wanted to go toward the streetlights
But the city at night was not for you
Your mind saw sparks, mine saw stars
We played games, we played guitars
I don't know where you are but I'm coming
Spider

Your mind saw sparks, mine saw stars
We were playing games, playing guitars
I don't know, I don't know
Spider
They want you, they want you, they want you
