The cat calls through the night
And two chicks in the parking lot
Crack wise on the price of fame
They stood to gain
The phonebook's been ripped off
And two shapes in the dark
Across the way know the price of flight
Its weight and size
If you've got something
That sheds some light
Use it tonight, tonight
Heads down thumbs up
Two sips from the cup of human kindness
And im shit faced, just laid to waste
So wait here, wait up
Stock tips from the credit checks
Come next in the logic's line
Halt on that dime
If you've got will and a little time
Use it tonight, tonight
You had to send a wrecking crew after me
I cant walk right
You had to send a wrecking crew after me
I cant walk right
Phantom of the heart
Four beats from the parting lungs and mind
Since I was a child
Just grew there wild
So heads down thumbs up
Four beats from soft
And get set to exercise your right
Use it tonight
If theres a choice between a chace and flight
Choose it tonight, tonight
You had to send a wrecking crew after me
I cant walk right
You had to send a wrecking crew after me
I cant walk right
I cant walk right
Use it tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Night
Night
Night
