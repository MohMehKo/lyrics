If you can't see my mirrors
I see you coming around, yeah
You're coming around

If you can't see my mirrors
I see you coming around, yeah
You're coming around

Pissed-up Sunday morning
We'll miss you in the show
Pissed-up Sunday morning
We'll miss you when you go
Go gently through the floor
A dismal and meaningless sigh

Pissed-up Sunday morning
We'll miss you when you go
Pissed-up Sunday morning
I'd kiss you, but you know
It'd be gently through the door
A dismal and meaningless sigh

Home from your elevens (?) tour
Honorable discharge aboard the HMS Pinafore
Oh what fun, oh what more (?)

If you can't see my mirrors
If you can't see my mirrors
If you can't see my mirrors
If you can't see my mirrors
