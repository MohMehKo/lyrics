I stole a page from your book
And a line from your page
And flew into a lesbian rage

Cursing mine and my own rotten luck
Another nude descends
A staircase to get fucked

A city scene
Darkness falls
Now skate hard down the gallery walls
Explore those themes
I hear your work's informed by queens
So is mine now

There's a plague on
There's a rat-tailed ensemble
Burying all of our hits in the sand
The same sand a desert uses

Now wipe that look from your face
The world is that which is the case
It's okay to be seen
Don't dethrone the drama queen
Just for putting everybody in their place

Go, don't stay
Just throw it all away
There is you
And then there is your body
