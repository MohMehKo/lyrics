Pinwheel spark break loose and roll
Where you stop nobody knows
Just a thought but gone down
It's been carved into a point understand

Turned into someone that you only know
When you're falling through your clothes

Run run run deep breath then jump
Roll with your vertigo stomp
Now you're clear but gone down
You've been cleared of every charge understand

You've turned into someone that you only know
When you're falling through your clothes
