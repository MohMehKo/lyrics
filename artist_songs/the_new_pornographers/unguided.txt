In every story, every secret told 
You are not the first to wake up 
To learn your lines before you have the part 
You woke up early and you woke up torn 
You're the temporary border 
The heatwave humming in the house of cards 

You spun chapter into rapture there 
Yeah, you were as brave as traffic 
You chased the spotlight into her arms 
And you forgot that you could fight 
But not that you were still the person sleeping 
The heatwave humming in the house of cards 

A play for the girl, a cross for a hook, sinking into the greasy wonder 
Under the sea, walking the floor, over the waves that we lived under 
Something's unguided in the sky tonight 
There is something unguided in the sky 

You wrote yourself into a corner safe 
Easy to defend your borders 
A fallen saint into a whispered time 
Killing time because they have to, why? 
Because it isn't mine, remember? 
Killing time because it wasn't mine 

You're earning your stripes, you're counting your stars 
You're (?) you barely work and wash 
You're lucky to be on the line like you are 
You're lucky you've already been caught 

Something's unguided in the sky tonight 
There is something unguided in the sky 

And why wait for the weakened state 
To lie next to the weaker sex? 
And why wait for the weakened state 
To lie next to the weaker sex? 

You're earning your stripes, you're counting your stars 
You're (?) you barely work and wash 
You're lucky to be on the line like you are 
You're lucky you've already been caught 

Something's unguided in the sky tonight 
There is something unguided in the sky
