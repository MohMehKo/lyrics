Last night I dreamt
Vancouver dressed up in the ocean
Last night I dreamt
Victoria drowned in the ocean

The ride of a lifetime
The rites of spring of a lifetime
The ride of a lifetime
The rites of spring of a lifetime

[Bridge:]
Blondes, brunettes, paper jets
Blondes, brunettes, paper jets
Star power, star power
The king bent over to smell a flower

[Pre-Chorus:]
I wanted to go home with you
I wanted to stay true to the cause
But look what we're living in

[Chorus:]
It's war on the east coast
It's war out west
Oh, I don't care
I don't care

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

I get it way back
I worked on it all day
A girl on a motorbike goes the wrong way
Wild gypsy ship
Never knew what hit

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x2]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x4]
