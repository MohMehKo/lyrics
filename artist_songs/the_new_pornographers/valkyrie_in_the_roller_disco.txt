Bounce off the walls
Valentine, have your fun
Come on, be the one
Come on, be the one

Light up the floor
With your moves, valentine
Come on, be the one
Come on, be the one

Do your worst, worst, worst...
Do your worst, worst, worst...

Valkyrie, don't go home
It's not right, not right
Leave with the lights up
It's half for me, half for love
You're a goldmine, goldmine

Stand in the puddles 
Of the disco ball's glow
Come on, be the one
Come on, be the one

There, just like that
There, you're doing it again
Come on, be the one
Come on, be the one

And what's worse, worse, worse...
There's no words, words, words...

Valkyrie, don't go home
It's not right, not right
Leave with the lights up
It's half for you, half for love
You're a goldmine, goldmine

Valkyrie, don't go home
It's not right, not right
Leave with the lights up
It's half for me, half for love
You're a goldmine, goldmine
You're a goldmine, goldmine
