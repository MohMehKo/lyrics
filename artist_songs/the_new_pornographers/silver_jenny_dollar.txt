She was only ever passing through
She's only ever passing through
Carlitas and You
Was the name of her act

And it's true
To love her
Is all I can do
In a world that's beaten everything
Black and blue

They holler 
Silver Jenny Dollar
Silver Jenny Dollar
Silver Jenny Dollar

We're only ever passing through
We were only ever passing through
Carlitas and You
Was the name of her act

And it's true
You noticed
It's all I can do
In a world that's beaten everything
Black and blue

They holler
Silver Jenny Dollar
Silver Jenny Dollar
Silver Jenny Dollar

The winter's over
The war is over
A parcel of land, men
Our scum is true
They'll love ya...

Silver Jenny Dollar
