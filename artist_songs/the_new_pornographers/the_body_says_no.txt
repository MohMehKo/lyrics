People of earth, we have heard your station
Sold your song to the United Nations.
All on a dare to the heads of state, yeah,
What could you do in the situation?

You throw the voice you know wouldn't say yes,
The body says no, no, no, no.
The body says no, no, no, no.
I say: man, can you believe, she didn't need me

Heavens to Betsy,
Come one let's see,
What could be worse than the wheel of history?
Rolling up over the rooms you've prayed in,
What could you do in the situation?
You throw the voice you know wouldn't say yes,
The body says no, no, no, no.
The body says no, no, no, no.

I say: man, can you believe, she didn't need me
Anymore than I needed her to.
Man, can you believe, she didn't need me
Anymore than I needed her to.
Man, can you believe, she didn't need me
Anymore than I needed her to.
Than I needed her to

Am I repeating myself to tell you dreaming?
It's what's left of psychedelia,
Caught in the life of any outlaw nation,
What can you do in the situation?

You throw the voice you know wouldn't say yes,
The body says no, no, no, no.
The body says no, no, no, no.
I say: man, can you believe, she didn't need me
Anymore than I needed her to.
Man, can you believe, she didn't need me
Anymore than I needed her to.
Than I needed her to
Than I needed her to
Than I needed her to
I say: man, can you believe, she didn't need me
I say: man, can you believe, she didn't need me
I say: man, can you believe, she didn't need me
