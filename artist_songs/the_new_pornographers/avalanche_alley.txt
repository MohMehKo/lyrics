Cover your eyes, surprise your fate
It's only an avalanche away, you're safe
It's only a scratch, you're great

Several years after the flood
Your singularity under the gun
So late, so late to the game, so late
We thought it was wise to wait

Sent your blues from the last world
News from the future

Several miles behind the wave
We needed to cross the ocean, we missed the ride
Lord knows we could use a ride

You summon the breath to finally say
It's only an avalanche away, feels right
And you can stay here tonight
Yeah, you can stay here tonight

Sent your blues from the last world

Butchering people, the cottage industry
The testimonials warning weather
Rules of the house
Rogue graffiti scroll
Ceremony calls, the tarred and feathered
Jewels in your crown
Are loud and proudly fake
Ceremony calls, the overthrowing

Consigned to the dustbin, all good lines turned away
Defined by the daylight waves we found in Avalanche Alley
Controlled demolitions of the times far away
In line for the festival that we call Avalanche Alley
