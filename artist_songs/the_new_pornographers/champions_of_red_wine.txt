We are champions of red wine, poured all over
It's what we're known for, find arms crossed lines
Crossed for old times, like starting over

Open up the headlamps, be poised to look for
You're coming over, you've done your research
It has the force of water, and we've got a lot here

The steps I take, back to you
The steps I take, back to you

I think we could save lives, if we don't spend them
Way undercover, I am not your love song
Love song gone wrong, I'm coming over

The steps I take, back to you
The steps I take, back to you

We are champions of red wine, poured all over
And we're coming over, we're coming over
We're coming over, we're coming over
