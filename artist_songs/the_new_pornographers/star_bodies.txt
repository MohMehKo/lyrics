On a tear
Under siege
Under oath
Anna lee
Won't you come
Strap yourself
To my side

With our grill
In disguise
We've got more
Lives than I
Ever dreamed
You could own
At one time

There's a shake with the shock
And a gift off with them
They carry the dust of the failing wisdom
For you there's not any warning
For you there's not any warning
And love is 5 in the morning

On a tear
Cautiously
We advance
Anna lee
Won't you come
Pass the torch
Bring your hands

Yes and no
There's no right
But we have no
Better light
To see through
To our star bodies go

There's a shake with the shock
And a gift off with them
They carry the dust of the failing wisdom
For you there's not any warning
For you there's not any warning
And love is 5 in the morning

Now take me to where your sister lives
Take me to where your sister lives
Take me to where your sister lives
Take me to where your sister lives

On a tear
Far from home
By a thread
Anna lee
What's been said
Has to say
Between us

Call me over
I trust
We lay here
'til we must
Make our break
To our star bodies go

There's a shake with the shock
And a gift off with them
They carry the dust of the failing wisdom
For you there's not any warning
For you there's not any warning
And love is 5 in the morning
For you there's not any warning

'til we skip through the towns to the bright sweet past on
And bury the dust of the failing wisdom
For you there's not any warning
For you there's not any warning
And love is 5 in the morning
For you there's not any warning

Now take me to where your sister lives
Take me to where your sister lives
