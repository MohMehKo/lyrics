When you gonna do some damage, little brother?
Now that half your life is over, if you're lucky
Looking at the trends of men down through your family

Boom there go the treetops
Once more 'round the sun dried
Just in case you were not listening
I'm for damage
Sweet damage
Oh damage
Sweet damage
Oh damage

Come on tell us
What we've won
Little brother's
Doing well
With his cave
Paintings selling
To the ballots and their brides
Little brother
You're inside
You're a nat-
ural we joke
In the early ABCs
Little brother
Come and see
Crossed his eyes
Once again
He thought you
Were in love
He's just glad
To be free
To our coun-
sel highly
Recommended

Oh-uh-uh-oh

Oh-uh-uh-oh

And you looked
Oh like you were saying something
And you looked
Like you were saying something

With this slight
Victory
Little brother
Took the keys
To the city
Which he found
On the floor
Of his van
Little brother
Clapping hands
For the turn
Of events
Unexpected

Oh-uh-uh-oh

Oh-uh-uh-oh

And you looked
Oh like you were saying something
And you looked
Like you were saying something

Introductions
Have been made
Little brother
I'm convinced
Yet again
Blew her off
She thought she'd
Stick it out
Little brother
Wished her well
The best wish-
es on both
Ends extended

Oh-uh-uh-oh

Oh-uh-uh-oh

And you looked
Oh like you were saying something
And you looked
Like you were saying something
