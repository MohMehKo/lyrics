I counted on my private Altamont
Trusted it all along
But now I'm on my way
We left the house,
Your fingers in my mouth
Stacked crooked all along
But now I'm on my way
Stacked crooked all along
But now I'm on my way
Ooh

The force left through the red light of the hours
I tried to imagine it
I couldn't imagine it
The vantage falling from the ivory tower
I tried to imagine it
I couldn't imagine it

You clicked and tossed
Your cryptic crossword loss
You then abandoned talks
And now it's hard to say
While we would weep
In smoke-and-mirror states
Stacked crooked all along
But now I'm on my way
Stacked crooked all along
But now I'm on my way
Ooh

The force left through the red light of the hours
I tried to imagine it
I couldn't imagine it
The vantage falling from the ivory tower
I tried to imagine it
I couldn't imagine it

Do not do not deny me
Tonight I lost a deal
Do not do not deny me
My own guillotine, oh
Do not do not my
Attention to detail
Do not do not deny me
The clicking of the heels

Do not do not deny me
Deny my loss of feel
Do not do not deny me
My Achilles' Heel
Do not do not my
Attention to detail
Do not do not deny me
The clicking of the heels
