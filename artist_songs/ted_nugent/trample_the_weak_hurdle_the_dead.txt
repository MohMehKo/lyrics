Trample the weak hurdle the dead
Crush their skulls, off with their heads
Trample the weak hurdle the dead
Give 'em hell, give 'em lead
I don't really care if war is not the answer
I only know that evil has got to go
I am well aware that evil is a cancer
It's about time for fire in the hole
Fire in the hole

I got trample the weak hurdle the dead
Trample the weak hurdle the dead
Trample the weak hurdle the dead
Trample, trample

Peace and love is good if you can make it happen
Gimme a shot
