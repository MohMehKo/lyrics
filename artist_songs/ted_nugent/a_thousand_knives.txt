You’ve been getting desperate; 
Scratching at my wall. 
Suicidal misfit; 
it’s time you took your fall. 

I’ve ducked a lot but like a thousand knives; 
Their cutting into you babe. 
It happens to you everyday. 

I was just a schoolboy; 
Doing as I please. 
Young girls in the classroom; 
They was putting on the squeeze. 

I’ve ducked a lot but like a thousand knives; 
Their cutting into you babe. 
It happens to you everyday. 

I’ve ducked a lot but like a thousand knives; 
Listen to what I say. 
The time has come for you to pay. 

Now I won’t listen to your two cents; 
To run and hide is your only defense 
A thousand knives, oh yea. 

Now your on the rebound; 
You know just how it feels. 
A copulated misfit; 
With the good housekeeping seal. 

I’ve ducked a lot but like a thousand knives; 
Their cutting into you baby. 
It happens to you everyday. 

Now I won’t listen to your two cents; 
To run and hide is your only defense.
