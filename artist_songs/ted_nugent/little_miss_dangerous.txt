She makes her move at midnight
She's got the magic touch
The little girl is dangerous
Just a bit too much

In the midnight hour
About the stroke of twelve
She'll be stepping out
She's gonna raise some hell
And it's her move
She's holding that wild card
Gotta make her move
She'll make your life so hard
High heel sneakers
Head to toe in lace
Such a dangerous body
With a little girl's face

[Chorus:]
Little Miss Dangerous
Little Miss Dangerous tonight
She's my little Miss Dangerous
Looks so dangerous tonight
Oh yes she is

Looking for trouble, looking for sex
Walking on the wild side, she's so complex
She's on fire (fire), the heat is coming on
The girls on fire (fire), she burns all night long
High heel sneakers
Head to toe in lace
Such a dangerous body
With a little girl's face

[Chorus:]
Little Miss Dangerous
Little Miss Dangerous tonight
She's my little Miss Dangerous
So dangerous tonight
Oh yes she is

[Chorus:]
Little Miss Dangerous
Little Miss Dangerous tonight
She's my little Miss Dangerous
Dangerous tonight
Oh yes she is

Little Miss Dangerous
Little Miss Dangerous
Little Miss Dangerous
She's so dangerous
She got that
Dangerous
She got that dangerous
Little Miss Dangerous
Dangerous
She's my little Miss Dangerous
She's my little Miss Dangerous
