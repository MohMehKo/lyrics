Everytime I hear your name 
You know I wonder why 
You wanted to go 
I said no 
You couldn't come along for the ride 
I said hey, I want outta here 
And nobody taggin' behind 

Don't you know 
I love you so I told you a lie 
Love you so I told you a lie 
When I told you goodbye 

A family life and a lovin' wife 
Just ain't my kinda scene 
Well when I'm all alone 
When the nights are cold 
I get to thinkin' I was kinda mean 
We couldn't had a good thing 
But I never wanted to try 

Don't you know 
I love you so I told you a lie 
Love you so I told you a lie 
When I told you goodbye 
You know I told you a lie 

Ah, ah ah, ah ah 
Ah, ah ah, ah ah 
Ah, ah ah, ah ah 
Ah, ah ah, ah ah 

A family life and a lovin wife 
Just ain't my kinda scene 
Well when I'm all alone 
And the nights are cold 
I get to thinkin' I was kinda mean 
We couldn't had a good thing 
But I never wanted to try 

Don't you know 
I love you so I told you a lie 
Love you so I told you a lie 
When I told you goodbye 
You know I told you a lie 
When I told you goodbye 

Don't you know, I love you so 
Don't tou know, I love you so I told you 
Don't tou know, I love you so I told you a lie 
Love you so I told you a lie 
I loved you so I told you a lie 
I loved you so I told you a lie 
Loved you so, loved you so 
Ahhhhhh 
Loved you so I told you a lie 
Ahhhhhh 
Loved you so I told you a lie
