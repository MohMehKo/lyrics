I'm not allergic, allergic to pain, no matter how hard I try
I crave you so bad, it drives me insane, if I don't have you I'll die..
I am a dangerous weapon baby, I'm your machine gun man
Don't make me shoot you down baby, I just wanna be your....
Love Grenade, I'm comin in, Love grenade, pull the pin, Love Grenade, Look out below, Love Grenade, I'm about to blow....

I'm on the front lines, the front lines of love, jump in a foxhole with me
Your body armor will do you no good, you'll be my 1st casualty...
I am collateral damage baby, I got your love IV

You'll never take me alive baby, just wanna be your.. Love Grenade....

I am your kamikaze baby, I am your dog fightin man
