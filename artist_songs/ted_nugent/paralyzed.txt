I'm on a mission of mercy. I gotta testify. 
You lost your emotions. You're paralyzed. 

Amputate your logic, you're hypnotized. 
You show no emotion. You're paralyzed. 

Don't you know you crucify yourself, oh, no. 
You're killin' you and nobody else, 
And I know you been spending your nights alone. 
The lights are on but there's nobody home. 

You don't know where you come from. You're not too wise. 
You got nowhere to run to. You paralyzed. 

Don't you know you crucify yourself, oh, no. 
You're killin' you and nobody else, 
And I know you been spending your nights alone. 
The lights are on but there's nobody home. 

Can you feel your body? Can you move your eyes? 
Can you feel your heartbeat? Well, are you paralyzed? 

Don't you know you crucify yourself, oh, no. 
You're killin' you and nobody else, 
And I know you been spending your nights alone. 
The lights are on but there's nobody home. 

Paralyzed
