I don't wanna hand nothin' to ya 
I just wanna sit back and do ya 
Dontcha make me stand up and chase it 
I just wanna lay back and taste it 
Come and get it right here for you 
I would never want to bore you 
No 
Come and get it 
Come and get it 
Come on girl and sit down beside me 

Let me tell ya whats burnin' inside me 
I want you to take it 
I know that you'll like it 
Sit right down and grab it and bite it 
Come on girl its right here for you 
I would never want to bore you 
No 
Come and get it 
Come and get it 

I don't wanna hand nothin' to ya 
I just wanna sit back and do ya 
Know you know you make me make me 
Know you know you make me crazy 
I just wanna lay back and taste it 
Come and get it right here for you 
I would never want to bore you 
No 
Come and get it 
Come and get it 
Come and get it 
Come and get it 
Come and get it 
Come and get it 
Come and get it 
Come and get it 
Come and get it
