I know what you're trying to say to me
I know 'cause I said it before
I know what you're trying to say to me
You don't have to try to say it no more

I know that you're trying to smile for me
I know 'cause it's there in your eyes
I know that you're trying to smile for me
and it comes as an old surprise

I feel that you're here to please me girl
I'm sure you are satisfied
I know that I please you too, my girl
You make me burst with pride

Smile, Sasha, smile
You make my life worth while
Smile, Sasha, smile
Oooh, oh

I know what I've got to prove to you
I know, 'cause the world is yours
And i know what you're trying to prove to me
You've gotta smile with joy

This world, it threatens to take it away
It'll leave you battered and worn
But magic is in my arms today
Little Sasha's just been born

Smile Sasha, smile
You make my life worth while
Smile, Sasha, smile
Oooh, oh
