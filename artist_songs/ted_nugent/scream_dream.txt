You see it all in New York, all over in Chicago
Wait till you see Detroit, when you're going to a go go

Looking for the violence, waiting for her mother
Sanity is past tense, I think I saw the brave boy

Scream dream [x4]

Our fantasies at midnight, with visions of a street rat
A yellow star daiquiri, splitting with a barber

Scream dream [x4]

Oh don't you see, I'm just cruising down the streets of the city
What I see ain't very pretty
I'm trying to sleep at night
But I think I'm in a cold sweat
And I gotta gotta scream loud

Scream dream [x12]
