Midnight in the cellar 
Dinner on the floor 
Sleeping in the gutter 
He fights a private war 
Hiding in the doorway 
Weapon at his side 
Rob you for a nickel 
You'd better run and hide 

He's a street rat 
Nothing to offer 
Street rat 
Snake in the grass 
Street rat 
Steals another meal 
Street rat 
But it maybe his last 

The look of desperation 
Sure to bite the dust 
His constant nauseation 
A real social cross 
He's a street rat 
Nothing to offer 

Street rat 
Snake in the grass 
Street rat 
Steals another meal 
Street rat 
But it maybe his last 

Post war anti-social 
A fading of the brain 
He's hopeless at his high school 
And lurking in the rain 

His face is badly beaten 
A nasty thing to see 
Street rats on the rampage 
You'd best keep away from me
