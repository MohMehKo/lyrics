Terminus.... 

Well... 

Cooped up inside the house, 
She had no place to go 
Runnin for the weekend 
Her daddy done told her no. 

All alone with the TV set 
Thinkin of things to do 
Gonna call up her best girlfriend 
Cause maybe she can do it too 

Her daddy had bought a brand new car 
Shiny red as can be 
A convertible top and a cb too 
"Or maybe he got it for me" 

She got the nerve 
She got the keys 
Take it for a little ride 
Aint old enough to drive alone 
But she just couldn't stay inside 

Terminus ha ha ha 

Ah ha ha ha 

Should have listened to your daddy 
Little girl 

Ha ha ha 

So they cruised downtown to the local run 
Show off a new Cadillac 
A little high, maybe do or die 
She aint gonna make it back 

Its a big red El Dorado 
Much too fast for her 
Forgot about tomorrow 
That much is for sure 

Ah oh 

She didn't see the tandem gravel truck 
Passin on the curve 
Too much fun 
Too little luck 
She didn't have time to swerve 

Terminus terminus 
Terminus El Dorado 

Terminus terminus 
Terminus El Dorado 

Terminus terminus 
Its all over for you baby 

No more 

Should have listened to your papa 

Bitch 

The crows be pickin at your flesh 
And ya got no control of the sitiation 

Ha ha ha ha ha 
Ha ha ha ha ha 

Good riddance baby 
Bye bye 
Bye bye baby 
Ha ha ha 
Nah nah na nah nah naahh naahh
