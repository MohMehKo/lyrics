Caught up on the wrong side of town
Na, Na, Na...

When Johnny hit the big time
He wuz livin’ on the hard line
Movin’ up on the wrong side of town
He wuz lookin’ for salvation
From a desperate situation
But the peer pressure lost what he found

It’s some place you don’t wanna go
You only end up on skid row
When you live with the vice and the snow
You know

Caught in a trap in the danger zone
Gonna take you down
Caught up on the wrong side of town
Livin’ on the edge of a broken dream
Swim or drown
Caught up on the wrong side of town

Na, Na, Na...

Yeah, Johnny lost direction
Then he gave into corruption
And he died on the streets with his dreams

Maybe Johnny took it all for granted
Maybe heaven is a place for hell
Oh, who’s sorry now
