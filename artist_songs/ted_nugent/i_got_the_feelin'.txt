I got the feeling like a man on the run
I got the feeling like a loaded gun
I got the feeling like it's mine all mine
I got the feeling, I got it double time

I got the feeling like her pants fits right
I got the feeling she's mine all mine
I got the feeling it's up to you
Soaped up bent over, it's what I like to do
Yeah yeah

I got the feeling like a man on the run
I got the feeling like an elephant gun
I got the feeling she's mine all mine
I got the feeling, I got it double time
All right
