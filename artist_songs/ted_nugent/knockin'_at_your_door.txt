Well, ever since I was 5 years old
You've filled me with a burnin' need
But you've acted oh, so damn cold
Like you never even noticed me

Well, they say that love always finds a way
Well, if it takes forever, and it may
I'm gonna...gonna...I'm gonna keep

Knockin' at your door
Late in the midnight hour
Knockin' at your door
Ooh when there ain't nobody around

There's nothin' in the whole wide world
That I wouldn't do for you
Even lay me down in the dirt
Oh just to show my love is true

Baby you can run but you can't hide
But you know that someday I'm gonna make you mine
I'm gonna knock, I'm gonna knock
And you're gonna let me in!

Knockin' at your door
Late in the midnight hour
Knockin' at your door
Ooh when there ain't nobody around
Knockin' at your door
'Til ya come and let me in
Knockin' at your door
Lord knows I'm never gonna quit

No!

Baby you can run but you can't hide
But you know that someday I'm gonna make you mine
I'm gonna knock, Gotta keep knockin,
And you're gonna notice me!

Knockin' at your door
Late in the midnight hour
Knockin' at your door
Ooh when there ain't nobody around

Let me in let me in
I'm never gonna quit
Why don't you understand?
I bet you got the whole thing planned...
