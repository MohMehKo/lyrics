Hey good lookin' 
What you got cookin' 
I need it on a Saturday night 

Don't know if I fall 
In a rock n' roll hall 
That sound is just what I like 

So turn it up, turn it up, make it louder than hell 
Turn it up, turn it up, make it ring like a bell 

I know what I like 
I got to turn it up tonight 
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, louder, louder 

Oh my god lock and load 
The stage is like a wall of sound 
what I need 
To help blow the walls down 

Turn it up, turn it up, make it louder than hell 
Turn it up, turn it up, make it ring like a bell 

I know what I like 
I got to turn it up tonight 
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, louder, louder, louder, yeah 

[Instrumental Interlude]

Oh my god lock and load 
The stage is like a wall of sound 
what I need 
To help blow the walls down 

Turn it up turn it up make it louder than hell 
turn it up turn it up make it ring like a bell 
I know what I like 
I got to turn it up tonight 
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, louder, louder, louder, yeah 

[Instrumental Interlude] 

So, turn it up, turn it up, make it louder than hell 
Turn it up, turn it up, make it ring like a bell 
I know what I like 
I got to turn it up tonight 
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, louder, louder, louder, yeah 

[Instrumental Interlude] 

Yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah 
Yeah............
