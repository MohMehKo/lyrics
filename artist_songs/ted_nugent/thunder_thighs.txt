Yeaahhh!!
I don't know where she come from
It must be some distant land
From a major city that's got no pity
She been lookin' for her man
Lo and behold, she's an overload
What a sight to see
I'm gonna run for cover, I can hear her thunder
She's comin' after me!

Thunder Thighs
Thunder Thighs
She's only five foot four, thank God no more
It's an even 185
A lovely lady, a graceful lady
She could eat this man alive
Likes to rock and roll, but got no control
When she sits down to a meal
The big legged woman ain't got no soul
This little girl's just unreal

Thunder Thighs
What'd I say
Thunder Thighs
Come on baby
Thunder Thighs
She's big, she's bouncy
Thunder Thighs
Hey, hey, heeeyyy!
Come on baby
Sweat!
Look out!
Heeyyyy!
Here she comes,
I can hear her
Here she comes,
I can smell her
Here she comes,
Gonna knock me down
Come on baby
Come on baby, let's dance
Thunder Thighs
Thunder Thighs
Thunder Thighs
Heeeyyy!

Here I stand a shattered man,
A poor dog on the run
Well I must confess, she's dangerous
But we sure do have our fun
She sets me free when she sits on me
Takes my breath away
Well, a big legged woman ain't got no soul
At least that's what they say

Thunder Thighs
Thunder Thighs
Thunder Thighs
She's big
Thunder Thighs
She got a big leg
Thunder Thighs
Big lady
Thunder Thighs
No, no, wait a minute darling
Wait, wait a minute baby
Don't sit on me
Don't sit on me
You can do anything,
But don't sit on me
Bitch!
Uhhh!
