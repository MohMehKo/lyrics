Summertime 
Summer days and different ways of loving you 
Starry skies 
Starry nights and northern nights are shinin' 
The crystal ball 
Showed me all there was to see 
Your time, and mine belong together
Together........ 

Many times 
Wanting you and needing you 
Yes all the time 
Many nights 
Loving you and holding you 
And feelin' fine 

The crystal ball 
Showed me all there was to see 
Your time and mine belong together
Together...... 

Thinkin' back 
Bout the time we had along the ways 
Oh! summertime 
You've gone to cloudy skies 
And rainy days 
The crystal ball is on and I 
The vision seems less clear tonight 
Your time and mine belong together

Together.... 
Together.... 
Together.... 
Together.... 
Together.... 
Together....
