Baby, please don't go 
Baby, please don't go 
Please don't go down to New Orleans 
You know I love you so 
Baby, please don't go, alright 

Before I be your dog 
Before I be your dog 
Before I be your dog 
I get you way down here 
And make you walk alone 
Baby, please don't go, alright 

When the man done gone 
When the man done gone 
When the man done gone 
At the county farm 
He had the shackles on 
Baby, please don't go 

Baby, please don't go 
Baby, please don't go 
Please don't go down to New Orleans 
You know I love you so 
Baby, please don't go 

When the man done gone 
When the man done gone 
When the man done gone 
At the county farm 
He had the shackles on 
Baby, please don't go 

Well after you left 
My baby's leaving on that midnight train 
And I'm crying (2x) 
Baby, please don't go 
Baby, please don't go 
Please don't go down to New Orleans 
You know I love you so 
Baby, please don't go 

Before I be your dog 
Before I be your dog 
Before I be your dog 
I get you way down here 
And make you walk alone 
Baby, please don't go, alright
