Aww go ahead, Ted

Beats in the street and I'm coming
Dead headed over the map
Highway trains keep on runnin'
Sneakin' right through the traps [?]

White line
Double time
Come around with a hammerdown

Hammerdown
Hammer

Last night saw me in Detroit
Home town boy lookin' good
Ride like we stink in the daylight
Play rock and roll like I should

White line
Double time
Come around with a hammer, hammer, hammer hammerdown

Hammerdown
Hammerdown
Hammerdown
Hammer

Thousand gigs in Chicago
Never played Delaware
There are places where I'll go
I fly by night, love affair

White line
Double time
Come around with a hammer, hammer, hammer hammerdown

Hammerdown
Hammerdown
Hammerdown
Hammer

Last night saw me in Detroit
Home town boy lookin' good
Ride like we stink in the daylight
Play rock and roll like I should

White line
Double time
Comin' 'round with a hammer, hammer, hammer hammerdown

Hammerdown
Hammerdown
Hammerdown
Hammer

Hammerdown
Hammerdown
Hammerdown
Hammer...
