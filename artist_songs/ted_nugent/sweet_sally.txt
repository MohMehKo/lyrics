Sweet Sally, she's a friend of mine
Sweet Sally likes it double time
Sweet Sally, she's a friend of mine
Sweet sweet Sally likes it double time
Sweet sweet Sally she's a friend of mine

Long legs in an evening gown
Her black hair just-a falling down
A sweet smile and she looks so fine
Sweet sweet Sally likes it double time
Sweet sweet Sally she's a friend of mine

The young girls always turning me on
Some of them more than most
They know just what I like
And I get it from coast to coast

So young girls won't you gather round
You know what's coming down
Take a lesson from a friend of mine
Sweet sweet Sally likes it double time
Sweet sweet Sally she's a friend of mine
Get on babe

Sweet Sally, she's a friend of mine
Sweet Sally likes it double time
Sweet Sally, she's a friend of mine
Sweet sweet Sally likes it double time
Sweet sweet Sally likes it all the time
Sweet sweet Sally she's a friend of mine

Sally, don't you get her daddy
Sally, sweet sweet Sally
Sweet Sally she's a friend of mine
