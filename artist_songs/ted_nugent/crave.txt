A simple life, I will not have
It doesn't satisfy me
I don't believe in the status quo
It kinda leaves me weak,
A mountain high is what I climb,
I'll swim a river deep
So if you crave the time of your life,
Try to keep up with me, hey,
I'm gonna live I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna soar till the day I die,
And all the wings of a bird are prey,
Hey hey hey,
Your absolutely what I crave,
Look at me,
I got a smile on my face
You know it don't come cheap,
Sure I live the American dream,
Go ahead and crucify me, yeah
I'm gonna live I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna soar till the day I die,
And all the wings of a bird are prey,
Hey hey hey,
Your absolutely what I crave,
Crave,
I'm gonna live I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna soar till the day I die,
And all the wings of a bird are prey,
Hey hey hey,
I'm gonna live I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna soar till the day I die,
And all the wings of a bird are prey,
Hey hey hey,
Your absolutely what I crave
Crave
