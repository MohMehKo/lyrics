Here I come again now, baby
Like a dog in heat 
Tell it's me by the clamor now baby
I like to tear up the street,

Now I been smokin for so long,
Ya know I'm here to stay
Got you in a stranglehold, baby
You best get outta the way

The road I cruise is a bitch now, baby
But no, you can't turn me round
And if a house gets in my way, baby
Ya know I'll burn it down

You ran the night that you left me
You put me in my place
I got you in a stranglehold, baby
You better trust your fate 

Yeah
Sometimes you wanna get higher
And sometimes you gotta start low
Some people think they gonna die someday
I got news, ya never got to go

C'mon c'mon up 
C'mon c'mon up
C'mon c'mon up 
C'mon c'mon up

C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon baby
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon up
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon baby
C'mon c'mon c'mon

Road I cruise is a bitch now
Ya know ya can't turn me round
And if a house gets in my way
Ya know I'll burn it down

You ran the night that you left me
You put me in my place
I got you in a stranglehold, baby
That night I crushed your face
