There was a time
When I didn't care,
Nothin' mattered to me I swear

Then something happened
I came alive,
I found you and I found fire

And I never stopped believing,
I never stopped dreaming

And I got a dream like Martin Luther King,
In my heart
I hear that man sing
So I climb up his mountain
To shout it out loud
I got a dream I swear to God

And I never stopped believing,
I never stopped dreaming

And I fly away,
Soaring on the wings of an eagle everyday
I fly straight to the top I just can't stop no way
I found paradise through sacrifice my way
And I'm living the dream more than it seems today

And I never stopped believing,
I can't stopped dreaming

And I never stopped believing,
I dream on,
I can't stopped dreaming
I dream on,

And I know many gave all,
On my knees I humbly fall
I see those crosses
And old glory,
And that's why nothing will ever stop me

And I never stopped believing,
I never stopped dreaming

And I never stopped believing,
I can't stopped dreaming
And I never stopped believing,
I never stopped dreaming
And I never stopped believing,
I never stopped dreaming

And I can't stopped believing,
I never stopped dreaming
And I can't stopped believing,
I never stopped dreaming
And I never stopped believing,
I never stopped dreaming
