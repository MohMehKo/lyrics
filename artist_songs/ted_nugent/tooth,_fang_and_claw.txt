I ain't got time for make believin'
My time is short, but I'm here to stay
No politics will cure the grievin'
So I choose my life, but I choose it my way

(and) Just like the wolf, I'm getting hungry
The law of the land, it is my will
And I ain't got time for staying angry
But I got the time to make a kill
Watch me kill

I'm gonna live tooth, fang, and claw
I'm gonna live, and I live my way
Watch me live tooth, fang, and claw
Watch me live an extra day

The red man he walked on a sacred hillside
The black man he runs through his Africa
But my daddy stalked the amber prairies
We all gotta live by nature's law
Watch me live

I'm gonna live tooth, fang, and claw
I'm gonna live, and I live my way
Watch me live tooth, fang, and claw
Watch me live an extra day
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Don't you worry about me
'cause I can and I will survive
I'm running with the pack babe
And like a lone wolf I am alive
Like my forefathers before me
I can use my own two hands
You best believe me
I can live off the land
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

The red man walked on a sacred hillside
And the black man still runs in Africa
Fred Bear he stalked the amber prairies
Me too
We all gotta live by nature's law
Live

I'm gonna live tooth, fang, and claw
I'm gonna live, and I live my way
Watch me live tooth, fang, and claw
And watch me live an extra day
I got ta got ta got ta live
Hey hey
Tooth, fang, and claw

Hey hey
Tooth, fang, and claw

Hey hey
Tooth, fang, and claw
Live, live

Hey hey
Tooth, fang, and claw
I got ta live
Hey hey hey hey
Tooth, fang, and claw
I'm alive I'm alive oh whoa
Hey hey hey hey
Tooth fang and claw
I got ta got ta got ta live

Spirit of the wild
