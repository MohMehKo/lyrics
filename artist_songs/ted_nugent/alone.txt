Did you know
Could you see
Don't you feel

You should have told me
I was there
When you needed

But you lied
Now you're gone
And I'm alone

I get scared
Feel the pain
My hearts bleeding

I can't believe all the loneliness
I was lost when you left our home
It was strange to exist with the loneliness
I'm not used to being alone

They were sure
I was strong
I could take it

They don't see
All the nights
That I cry

I can't believe all the loneliness
I was lost when you left our home
It was strange to exist with the loneliness
I'm not used to being alone

Maybe now
I can find
A new baby

Maybe now
I can start
Over again

No more tears
No more pain
And no lying

Its so hard
Its ok
Now I'm trying

I can't believe all the loneliness
I was lost when you left our home
It was strange to exist with the loneliness
I'm not used to being alone

Not used to being alone
Not used to being alone
Not used to being alone
Not used to being alone
Not used to being alone
Not used to being alone
Not used to being alone
Not used to being alone
Not used to being alone
Not used to being alone
Not used to being alone
