And if you see my baby, tell her that I'm gone
I've been missing in action, just to say "so long"

Bye bye baby

And if she wants to find me, she's out of luck
I'm in a state of confusion, she's in a state of shock
Yes she is

In a state of shock, that's where you'll find me, in a state of shock
In a state of shock, that's where I'm cruisin', in a state of shock

Come on

Yeah she has lost her direction, she tried to make a buck
In a state of confusion, in a state of shock

She's in a state of shock, she goes crazy
She's in a state of shock, she is confused
She's in a state of shock, so confused
She's in a state of shock, losing her mind
She's in a state of shock...
