Caught off guard on the downtown street
Love patrol was puttin' on the heat
Feelin' good, feelin' oh so fine
Got no money, but I sho' nuff got the time

Don't know why I feel this way
But it sure feels mighty good
C'mon baby walk this way
like I knew you would

'Cause you are my lovejacker, baby
You are my lovejacker, baby

She stole my heart it was a felony
No defense that could set me free
You little misdemeanor
You ought be ashamed

Don't know why I feel this way
But it sure feels mighty good
C'mon baby walk my way
like I knew you would

'Cause you are my lovejacker baby
You are my lovejacker, baby

She broke the rules
Took the law in her own hands
Now I feel so helpless
I just want to be your man

Go down to the river baby
That's where I'll be
I'm gonna jump in now, baby
If you don't come take me

Open up your heart
Can't you see that I love ya
Open up your heart
Can't you see that I need you

You are my lovejacker, baby
You are my loverjacker, baby
