Some smells good

I Love My BBQ
it's what Americans do,
Pull up a chair I'll get a beer for you

I Love My BBQ
It's what Canadians do,
Pull up a chair I'll get a beer for you

That tofu just might kill you
Toss salad makes you weak
I like to kill 'em and grill 'em baby
It's protein that we seek , oh no
Shit's gonna die

I Love My BBQ
It's what Africans do,
Pull up a chair I'll get a beer for you

Well I got me some avocado baby,
TexMex is on the grill

Show love them jalapena poppers
But we don't eat until we kill, no way
Shit's gonna die

I Love My BBQ it's what the Germans do,
Pull up a chair I'll get a beer for you

Well the animals
They got rights,
Next to my mashed potatoes baby
We love animals they gonna be alright,
Grill 'em with the Rutabaga

I Love My BBQ it's what the Polacks do,
Pull up a chair I'll get a beer for you

I Love My BBQ

Don't fool just my kill you
