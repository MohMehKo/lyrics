Cruisin, cruisin
It's what I do to get back to you
And I'm cruisin

Cruisin, cruisin
It's what I do to get back to you
And I'm cruisin

Get back baby get back
Where you ought to be
Get back baby get back
Right here next to me
Come on baby come on
I got you on the line
Come on baby come on
I got you double time

Cruisin, cruisin
It's what I do to get back to you
And I'm cruisin

Get down baby get down
Can't get away from me
Get down baby get down
I know you through and through
Look out baby look out
Got my eyes on you
Look out baby look out
I know you through and through

Cruisin, cruisin
It's what I do to get back to you
And I'm cruisin

Cruisin, cruisin
It's what I do to get back to you
And I'm cruisin

Get back baby get back
Where you ought to be
Get back baby get back
Right here next to me
Come on baby come on
I got you on the line
Come on baby come on
I got you double time

Cruisin, cruisin
It's what I do to get back to you
And I'm cruisin

Cruisin, cruisin
It's what I do to get back to you
And I'm cruisin

Cruisin, cruisin

Don't Worry, you can still
