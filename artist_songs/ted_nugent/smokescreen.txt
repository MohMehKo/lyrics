Hey now mama if you got the time
There's few things I must say
I've got some news and it's on my mind
So don't get in my way
I won't be fooled by the things you do
I know all of your tricks
There's a smokescreen baby all around you
Got some of my own, ya

Smokescreen

I work so hard and I treat you right
How can you be so cruel?
I take your baggage on my lovin' heart
Waitin' many times for you
I know you and the things you do
Don't think you foolin me
There's a smokescreen baby all around you
I just can't let you be

Smokescreen

You admit you was on the rag
Treating me with your tongue
I stood strong, it was such a drag
There was no suicide attempt
But we worked it out and everything's all right
I'm so glad your safe
There's a smokescreen baby all around you
So don't get in my way
