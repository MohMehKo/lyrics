1, 2, 3, 4

Do be do be do ba do be do bah - repeat
Alright!
Heey Gimme Sexpot!
Come here girl...

Everybody looking for adventure
Everybody coming up good
Ridden down the road less traveled
It's all about the attitude
Even if you gotta have the answer
By all means tell me true
Do unto others, as they do unto you
Ya Sexpot
Come over here baby...

Gotta get my bad self together

Gotta let the big dog run
Gotta let the spirit run wild
God gave man guns
I refuse to stand and take it
I refuse backing down
Gotta shake my money maker
Shake it down

Sexpot! Sexpot!
Come on now...

Hey!

Alright...
