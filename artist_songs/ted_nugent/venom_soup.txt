My castles they are falling
But who they fall on? You
Your bite is so deadly
But who is it killing? You
You are the devil's sister
Your bite belongs to just one group
You are the demon's right arm
Dishing out your venom soup

My sabre never cuts you
You have the magic charm
My sabre never ever cuts you
You are the demon's arm

I scream and then I wonder
How does your heart still beat
You have the eyes of terror
Looking at your victim's meat
I hide and I avoid you
I tremble at your voice and sight
You are the child of Satan
I feel we'll make love tonight

My sabre never cuts you
You have this magic charm
My sabre never ever cuts you
You are the demon's arm

I scream and then I wonder
How does your heart still beat
You have the eyes of terror
Looking at your victim's meat

My sabre never cuts you
You have this magic charm
My sabre never ever cuts you
You are the demon's arm

You are the devil's sister
Your bite belongs to just one group
You are the demon's right arm
Dishing out your venom soup

Dishing out your venom soup
Dishing out your venom soup
