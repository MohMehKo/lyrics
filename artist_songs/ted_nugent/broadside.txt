Sometimes I feel like a dog,
Got no place to run
I feel all alone,
My only friend is my gun

So I get up everyday,
And I stand up and I fight
They say I'm a crazy man,
I say I'm doin' alright, alright

Don't kick the dog he's man's best friend,
Let 'em lie he'll be alright
Its against the law since
I can't say when,
He'll be right there 'til the bitter end

Hit broadside,
Sucker-punched again
Hit broadside,
Sucker-punched my friend.

You can't bullshit the boss,
He's a smart sonofabitch
It might be your loss,
Might be too late to switch.

Don't kick the dog he's man's best friend,

Let 'em lie he'll be alright
Its against the law since
I can't say when,
He'll be right there 'til the bitter end.

C'mon, hit me baby broadside,
Broadside
Sucker-punched again.
Hit broadside,
Sucker-punched again.
Hit broadside,
Sucker-punched again.
I like it broadside.
Broadside,
Sucker-punched again.
Broadside,
Broadside,
Broadside,
Sucker-punched again,
Hit me baby broadside,
Broadside, sucker-punched again,
Broadside.
Go ahead, hit me baby, hit me baby
Broadside!
