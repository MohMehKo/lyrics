Never before have I turned on you
Ya look too good to me
Your beady eyes nearly cut me into
And I just can't let ya be
Well it's a free-for-all
And I heard it said
You can bet your life
The stakes are high and so am I
It's in the air toni-i-ight

I see you there with your Cheshire grin
I got my eyes on you
Ya shake your tail feathers in my face
No telling what I might do
Well looking here ya sweet young thing
Cause the magic's in my hands
When in doubt I whip it out
I got me a rock and roll band
It's a free-for-all

Ooh, baby
Yeah, it's a free-for-all

Here we go look out below, I'm on the prowl tonight
When it's said and done I'll have my fun
I can chew anything I bite
Come one, come all to the midnight ball
Your invitation's there
Come alone and I'll drive ya home
Oh help me I do declare
It's a free-for-all

Ooh, baby
Yeah, it's a free-for-all

Never before have I turned on you
Ya look too good to me
Your beady eyes nearly cut me into
And I just can't let ya be
Well it's a free-for-all
And I heard it said
You can bet your life
The stakes are high and so am I
It's in the air tonight
It's a free-for-all

Look, baby
It's a free-for-all
