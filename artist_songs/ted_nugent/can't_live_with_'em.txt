It was hit and run when ya took my heart away 
Nothin' you could do to change my mind 
Nothin' you could say to make me stay 
Here I go alone, into the night 

I can't live with ya 
I can't live without your love 
I can't live with ya 
I can't live without your love 

You terrorize my dreams at night 
I crave your touch to chase my blues away 
And nothin I could say to make ya stay 
Here I go again, into the night 

I can't live with ya 
I can't live without your love 
I can't live with ya 
I can't live without your love 


I try and try to change my mind 
There ain't much hope 
Now ain't no time 
The situations got the best of me 
Awwww yup.... 

Nothin' I could say 
To make me stay 
Here I go again 
Into the night 
Here we go baby...

I can't live with ya, can't live without you 
I can't live with ya, can't live without you 
No 
Can't live with ya, can't live without you 
Can't live with ya, can't live without you 

No,no
