I still believe
One, two, three, four

I still believe in the American Dream
I still believe you can hear me scream
It's still alive it's on fire,
I defy, it ain't no lie

I don't care what they do to me
I'm addicted to liberty
I will cross that Concorde Bridge
It's the bridge to my destiny

Cos I persue life,
I persue my happiness
Cos I am so damn alive
I am so in love with this

I was born in that Detroit town
Heart and soul of America
I have seen her ups and downs
What comes around goes around

But I still believe,
I believe in America I believe,
I still believe,
I believe in America I believe,
I still believe,
I believe in America I believe,
I still believe,
I believe in America

And I don't predict disaster
I see no doom and gloom
I believe in forever after
And I believe it's coming soon

I still believe in the American Dream
I still believe you can hear me scream
It's still alive it's on fire,
I defy, it ain't no lie

I still believe,
I believe in America I believe,
I still believe,
I believe in America I believe,
I still believe,
I believe in America I believe,
I still believe,
I believe in America I believe,
I still believe,
I believe in America I believe,
I still believe,
I believe in America I believe,
I still believe,
I believe in America America, Amer, Amer, America
I believe baby
I believe in just know fuck

One, two, three, four
I still believe in the American Dream
I still believe you can hear me scream
