That's right
Got nothing at see me
Come on

I get up everyday with a smile on my face
Happy to be alive back in the race
I don't believe that talk is cheap
You play your cards, you read em & weep

It's outrageous,
It's contagious, positive energy makes me smile
It's outrageous,
It's contagious, victory makes it all worth while

I got nuthin', nuthin', I got nuthin' to fear but fear itself
I got nuthin', nuthin', I got nuthin' to fear but fear itself
Let me

Kickin' ass to earn my way,
But lucky me my work is play
I don't believe it's a waste of time
What's yours is yours what's mine is mine

It's outrageous,
It's contagious, positive energy makes me smile
It's outrageous,
It's contagious, victory makes it all worth while

I got nuthin', nuthin', I got nuthin' to fear but fear itself
I got nuthin', got nuthin', I got nuthin' to fear but fear itself
Oh yeah

I get up everyday with a smile on my face
Happy to be alive back in the race

It's outrageous,
It's contagious, victory makes it all worth while
It's all worth while

But I got nuthin', nuthin', I got nuthin' to fear but fear itself
I got nuthin', nuthin', nuthin' to fear but fear itself
I got nuthin', nuthin', nuthin' to fear but fear itself
But I got nuthin', nuthin', got nuthin' to fear but fear itself
I got nuthin', got nuthin', I got nuthin' to fear but fear itself
I got nuthin', got nuthin', I got nuthin' to fear but fear itself
Nuthin', I got nuthin', I got nuthin' to fear but fear itself
I got nuthin', I got nuthin', I got nuthin' to fear but fear itself
I got nuthin', got nuthin', I got nuthin' to fear but fear itself
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta,
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, fear itself
I got nuthin', I got nuthin', I got nuthin' to fear but fear itself
I got nuthin', got nuthin', I got nuthin' to fear but fear itself
I got nuthin', I got nuthin', got nuthin' to fear but fear itself
