There I was minding my own business
A little girl chance to come my way
She was fine she was taken care of business
She had the look but I had what to say

Are you hot or cold

Now i'm aware of political correctness
I will fight for the lady's rights
But watch me close as I correct this
I try to do it each and every night

Are you hot or cold
Make up your decision
I gots to know before I make my move

Are you hot or cold
No more indecision
You got me baby yea you got me good
