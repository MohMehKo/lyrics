Shutup&Jam!

You say you heard it all,
I believe we've had enough
Everybody's looking for a free for all,
enough of that political stuff

Right left good bad it all gets boring and old
The only hope for America
Is that good ol rock-n-roll

So shutup & jam,
You know who I am,
You know where I stand
So shutup & jam
Shutup & jam
Shutup & jam
Gonna shutup & jam

Shutup

The line is drawn in the sand why don't you admit it
If you get too serious you might have a heart attack
Too much fun & games make you delirious
Why don't you fight back
Fight back

You fight the fight and give it your best but everybody needs a break
There comes a time when you just gotta rock
There's only so much you can take

So shutup & jam,
You know who I am,
You know where I stand
So shutup & jam
Shutup & jam
Shutup & jam
Shutup & jam
Shutup & jam
Shutup & jam
Shutup & jam
Shutup & jam
Shutup & jam
Shutup & jam
Shutup & jam
Shutup & jam
Shutup & jam

Shutup & jam
