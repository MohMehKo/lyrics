Last time I saw you was too long ago
I'm coming back and I want you to know
Being away from you just, just ain't the same
I'm coming home to reinstate my claim

To my woman, my one woman

I used to run around like a meat-hungry hound
I had to line 'em up, you know I really got around
But then I met you honey, saw your pretty face
I had a change of heart, you know I had a change of pace

One woman, my one woman
One woman, my one woman
And I'm yours
What can I say, what can I do
I love you

Now I know it's true variety adds spice
But it's the real feel that motivates my life
I like them short, I like them tall, I like them clean
But talking nitty-gritty, you know what I mean

One woman, my one woman
One woman, my one woman
And I'm yours
What can I say, what can I do
I love you
