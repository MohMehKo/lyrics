There I was back in the wild again.
I felt right at home, where I be-long.
I had the feeling, coming over me again.
Just like it happened so many times be-fore. eh.
The Spirit of the Woods is like an old good friend.
Makes me feel warm and good in-side.
I knew his name and it was good to see him again.
Cause in the wind he's still a-live.
Oh Fred Bear
Walk with me down the trails again.
Take me back, back where I be-long.
Fred Bear
I'm glad to have you at my side my friend
And I'll join you in the big hunt before too long
Before too long.
It was kinda dark, another misty dusk
It came from a tangle down be-low.
I tried to re-mem-ber everything you taught me so well.
I had to de-cide which way to go.
Was I a-lone or in a hunter's dream.
Cause the moment of truth was here and now.
I felt his touch I felt his guiding hand.
The buck was mine forever more!!
Oh Fred Bear
Walk with me down the trails again.
Take me back, back where I be-long.
Fred Bear
I'm glad to have you at my side my friend
And I'll join you in the big hunt before too long
Before too long.
We're not alone when we're in the great outdoors
We got his spirit We got his soul
He will guide our steps and our arrows home
The restless spirit still roams
Oh Fred Bear
Walk with me down the trails again.
Take me back, back where I be-long.
Fred Bear
I'm glad to have you at my side my friend
And I'll join you in the big hunt before too long
Before too long.
