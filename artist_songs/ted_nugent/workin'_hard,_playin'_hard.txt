Man started out with it in a cave;
They're runnin' home, nobody's safe.
Left with a note, all alone;
Only wanted to have a happy home.

Now it's my turn to show my stuff;
It's sometimes fun and sometimes rough.
I'm workin' hard to earn my way;
But, lucky me, my work is play.

Workin' hard, playin' hard;
Helps me get thru each day and night.
Workin' hard, playin' hard;
Makes everything all right.

I'm here to sow my wild seed;
I don't want much just what I need.

Workin' hard, playin' hard;
Helps me get thru each day and night.
Workin' hard, playin' hard;
Makes everything all right.

Helps me get thru each day and night.
Workin' hard, playin' hard;
