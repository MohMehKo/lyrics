I think I know your condition
Yes I've been down that road before
Maybe it's just superstition
But there's one thing that I know for sure
I gotta to have me some

Good friends and a bottle of wine
Good friends to show me good time
Good friends and a bottle of wine
I'm so glad for just what I got
And I'm so glad I got me alot

They say that I'm going crazy
Well it's true, sometimes I want to scream
Maybe my vision gets hazy
But there's one thing I know that I need
I got to have me some

Good friends and a bottle of wine 
Good friends to show me good time 
Good friends and a bottle of wine 

I'm so glad for just what I got 
And I'm so glad I got me a lot

It's true that life has it moments
Sometimes up and sometimes down
Identify your opponents
And gather all your good friends around
I got to have me some

Good friends and a bottle of wine 
Good friends to show me good time 
Good friends and a bottle of wine 
I'm so glad for just what I got 
And I'm so glad I got me alot

Good friends and a bottle of wine
Good friends, bottle of wine
Good friends, bottle of wine
