Well, it happened after midnight
Fire burnin hot
The clan had all assembled
Fanned the flames of God
The witch doctor had spoken
The children hid in fear
The chief and all his warriors
They sacrificed the deer

Well, you sing with me baby
The bravado for your soul
Top of the crooked honour
You know I'm in control
See its dog eat dog
With the violence in the air
Let's keep it simple baby
You know damn well I care

I'm a primitive man
Doin what I can

Well, I'm a modern man from hell
With a duty on my mind
Takin care of family
You know the job is mine
King of my castle
Don't you dare tread on me
Cause if you cross that sacred line
I'll blow you all away

I'm a primitive man
Doin what I can

I'm a primitive man
Doin what I can

You should have seen me comin
Was now all-free to go
Boys knew winter was comin
Buffalo drive movin with the wind
White man he had no spirit
Civilization, the curse of man

Civilization, the curse of man

I'm a primitive man
Doin what I can

I'm a primitive man
Doin what I can

I'm a primitive man
Doin what I can

Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa

I'm a primitive man
Doin the best I can

Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa
Oh, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa
Ah, Ya, Oh, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa
