We need the time to rock away
a little work and then some play
workin' hard to feel good
now it's time to really live it up

Can't you see, I'm hap happy
I just can't stop, Got to live it up

Now's the time for really gettin it down
ain't no need in you hangin' around
skin to skin is how it should be
it's tough to touch everything that I see

Can't you see, I'm hap happy
I just can't stop, Got to live it up

[solo]

Sure been fun but it's time to go
just so we take you where you want to go
the sled outside 'll take too long
cause we can rock and light a song

Can't you see, I'm hap happy
I just can't stop, Got to live it up

Got to live it up 
Got to live it up 
Got to live it up 
Got to live it up 
Got to live it up .......
