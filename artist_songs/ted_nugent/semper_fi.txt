Semper Fi

Hit the ground runnin' don't look back
Fight like an animal heart attack
Never give up never back down
Blood Brother blade runner scorch the ground

Give 'em hell don't tell runnin' round pell mell rules of engagement
Got your six no tricks firepower deep six shadows on the pavement

Semper Fi
Hey now hey now hey now hey now Semper Fi
Hey now hey now hey now hey now Semper Fi

Chesty Puller homeboy Sherman tank funtoy scorched earth policy
Jarheads hoorah livin' dead hooskow never leave a brother behind Semper Fi

Soar like an eagle good over evil it's the American Way Semper Fi

Hey now hey now hey now hey now Semper Fi
Hey now hey now hey now hey now Semper Fi
