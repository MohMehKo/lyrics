Yeah
Come on

Do-rags and a .45,
Gotta keep my brothers alive,
Do-rags and a .45
Gotta git my brothers outta jail tonight

Runnin' like a dog on the downtown streets
I ain't afraid of the dogs I meet
Time will tell if you get it right
Gotta get my brothers outta jail tonight

The Motor City burns it's what we do
The dogs eat dogs ain't gotta clue
Motown rock is loads of fun
You better be ready better get your gun

Do-rags and a .45,
Gotta keep my brothers alive,
Do-rags and a .45
Gotta git my brothers outta jail tonight

Do-rags and a .45,
Gotta keep my brothers alive,
Do-rags and a .45
Gotta git my brothers outta jail tonight

Do-rags and a .45,
Gotta keep my brothers alive,
Do-rags and a .45
Gotta git my brothers outta jail tonight
