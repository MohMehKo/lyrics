I knew right when I saw you
that I just had to have you
you hit me right between my eyes

I approached the situation
with no hesitation
I knew that you were just my size

You got the kind of body
that makes me feel crazy
you make me wanna jump on it

I'm like a race horse
climb into my saddle
you know I'm jumpin' over this

I gotta bite down hard
I gotta bite down hard
I gotta bite down hard
Ooo yeah

Knocking you're runnin'
you know I got the money
I'm gonna stack it all on you

With your small pretty legs
and your long braided hair
I tell you what I'm gonna do

I'm gonna bite down hard
I'm gonna bite down hard
I'm gonna bite down hard
I've got to bite it
Like this

I gotta bite down hard
Sink my teeth deep
I gotta bite down hard
I gotta bite down hard
Got to scare men
I gotta bite down hard
I gotta bite down hard
Chew one up
I gotta bite down hard
I'd like to tell ya
I gotta bite down hard
I gotta bite down hard
It's what I'm gonna do
I gotta bite down hard
