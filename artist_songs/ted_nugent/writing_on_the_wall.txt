Blazin' down the highway
I'd rather have it my way
Gotta have more....
Rules on the roadside
Floor it like a landmine
Keep you on your toes

You head out for the take
What's the fuss your makin'
Can't you see the light?
You gotta get down when you roll up out of town
And it makes you feel alright

My life is a good life to lead
Writing on the wall is a good story to read

You think me a trusting tiger
I know that you're a lions
Eatin' from your hand
Burnin' down the hotel
Runnin' round hell now
Rock and roll band

Runnin' helter skelter
Knock her down and belt her
Show her who's the boss
You better treat her sweet
Or you'll be out in the street
And that would be a loss

My life is a good life to lead
Writing on the wall is a good story to read

Lining up to egg us
I'm sure they won't thank us
Needle in your mouth
But now that we know that I'd rather shoot a goose then let it
Flyin down south

Writin, writing on the wall
Writin, writing on the wall

Blazin' down the highway
I'd rather have it my way
Gotta have more
Rules on the roadside
Floor it like a landmine
Keep you on your toes

Writin, writing on the wall
Writin, writing on the wall
Writin, writing on the wall
Writin, writing on the wall
