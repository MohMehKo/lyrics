On my way
Baby, don't you stop my fire
I'm in love
Baby don't you stop my desire

So lover please don't you slow me down
I need my wheels always spinin' around your love

Ooh, she's gettin' me higher

Your love is like a spark
Of a nice light
You know your love is burnin' holes
You know it's burnin' bright

Oooh, yeah

On my way
Baby, don't you cool my desire
I'm in love
So baby don't you stop my fire

I've said the things I don't wanna say
I'm gonna love you anyway you want

Ooh, it's gettin' me higher

Light my way
Oh, light my way
