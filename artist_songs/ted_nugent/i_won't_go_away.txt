I wasn't afraid of your lightning, baby
Your thunder was a part of me
I'd dance with the devil at midnight maybe
Your threat is a catastrophe

And you can't stop me
You can't offend me
I ain't backing down

I'm here to tell you
I won't go away
I'm here to stay
Yeah, I won't go away, away

I'm like a grizzly bear on a rampage
A firestorm in your face
Time to assess the damage, baby
I will not get outta this race

You can't stop me
You can't offend me
I ain't backing down

I'm here to tell you
I won't go away
I'm here to stay
No, I won't go away
I'm here to stay

And I absolutely love your attitude
Now, you and me
We should go wild in the night
Come on

I absolutely love your attitude
You and me
We should go wild in the night
Come on

I won't go away
I'm here to stay
I won't go away
I'm here to stay

I won't go away
Yeah, I'm here to stay
I won't go away
I'm here to stay

I won't go away
I won't go away
I won't go away
