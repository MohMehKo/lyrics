STAND!!! STAND!!! STAND!!! 

Don't need big brother to wipe my ass,
Don't need Ted Kennedy to spill my glass.
Al not so Sharpton is a racist laugh,
The whole damn world can kiss my ass.

I don't need nobody to hold my hand,
Don't need nobody, I can stand
Make my own way in a rock-n-roll band,
Kiss my  ass I'm an American.

Don't need no hippies to ban my gun,
Don't need no commies no Mao Tse Tung
Rugged independence is a lotta fun,
I laugh so hard when I see em run.

I don't need nobody to hold my hand,
Don't need nobody, I can stand
Make my own way in a rock-n-roll band,

Don't ya think I'm taxed enuff?
Maybe it's time to call your bluff
Pimps & whores & welfare brats,
Too much government way too fat,

STAND!!! STAND!!! STAND!!! STAND!!!
