Everything matters if you think it matters no matter what anybody tells you
We get in the race with the wind in our face keep up the pace it's what we do
So when you come home feeling alone when everything comes a tumbling down
Tonight is the night it's gonna be alright you got your baby all around

I'm not too concerned
I might get burned, who knows
Lessons to be learned, stones to overturn, I know
Everything matters

You get back up cuz you never give up you were brought up to never give in
No way
You give it your best no thumpin' your chest ready to do it all over again

I'm not too concerned
I might get burned, who knows
Lessons to be learned, stones to overturn, I know I know I know
Everything matters
Yes I do

You get in the groove got nothin' to prove we pursue passionately
The rhythm & blues the power to soothe you cannot lose drastically

I'm not too concerned
I might get burned, who knows
Lessons to be learned, stones to overturn, I know I know I know
Everything matters
Everything matters
Everything matters
Oh yeah
Everything matters
Everything matters
Everything matters
Everything matters if you think it matters no matter what anybody tells you
