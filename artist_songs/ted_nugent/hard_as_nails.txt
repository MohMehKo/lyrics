Yeees!

Here I am, I would like to put it to you
I'm the man, I would like to slip it through you
On my way to my final destination
I will not sleep 'til I rock the nation

Here I am
Hard as nails
Here I am
Here I am
Hard as nails

I'm alive with a burnin' desire
So look alive, grab my live wire

Here I am
Hard as nails
Here I am
Here I am
Hard as nails

I say here I am
Hard as nails
Say look at me
Hard as nails...
