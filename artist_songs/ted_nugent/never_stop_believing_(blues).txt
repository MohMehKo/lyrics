There was a time
When I didn't care,
Nothin' mattered to me I swear

Then something happened
I came alive,
And I found you
And I found fire

And I never stopped believing,
And I can't stopped dreaming no way

And I got a dream
Like Martin Luther King,
In my heart
I hear that man sing
So I climb up his mountain
And shout it out loud
Cos I got a dream I swear to God

That's right
And I never stopped believing,
And I can't stopped dreaming no way

And I fly away,
I soaron the wings of an eagle everyday
I fly straight to the top I just can't stop no way, no way
I found paradise through sacrifice my way

And so I never stopped believing,
I can't stopped dreaming

And I know many gave all,
On my knees I humbly fall
I see those crosses
And I see old glory,
Well pie
And that's why nothing nothing
Will ever stop me

I will forever keep on believing
I never stopped dreaming no way

And I never stopped believing,
And I can't stopped dreaming

I will forever, forever believing
