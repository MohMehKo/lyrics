Finally it's Friday I'm out of my cage
Two days of freedom are coming for a rage
I go the dances and hit all the bars
On weekends my wages they go just so far

I'm a weekend, weekend warrior
Weekend, weekend warrior

So stand up and shake it and show them what you got
Find me expose me and shoot your own shot
There's no room for schoolgirls we're doing just as we please
Hanging out at pre-teens and putting on the squeeze

I'm a weekend, weekend warrior
Weekend, weekend warrior

I stayed out till Sunday and never went back home
Except with my best friend I won't stay alone
Explode I, I got high, took it to the end
Looking out for Monday I'll start it all again

I'm a weekend, weekend warrior
Weekend, weekend warrior

Weekend, weekend warrior
Weekend, weekend warrior
