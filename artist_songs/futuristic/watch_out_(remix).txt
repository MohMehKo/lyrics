[Intro - Futuristic:]
Watch out lil' bitch
I'm a give you some instructions ok?
Hmm

[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
Watch out lil' bitch
Please don't get world starred
Niggas mad because I'm getting rich
And you're still driving your girl's car
Wait, don't you have goals my nigga?
That chain ain't gold my nigga
Don't you wanna be a rapper when you grow up?
You ain't doing no shows my nigga
Y'all be like 34 still trying to make it
I'm 10 years younger and don't make no payments
Need it I cop it with no conversation
You should think of a backup occupation
Cutting a track every song operation
Come at the kid that's miscommunication
Losing patience basic lanes are faced with haters
But I ate it, ain't it banging when I make it
Swear to God that I've been on a rapper spree
I've been feeling sorry for the ones that's coming after me
Cause every track's a masterpiece and yours is a catastrophe
Spitting acid at them like a motherfucking battery
Reusing my lines new people try to adapt to me
Mc-dreamy them bitches see me on Grey's Anatomy
Leaving younger writers you can catch me at the factory
I've got the black so put the black in her mouth like a cavity
Watch out I got it if I'm being honest I think that they're terrible songs are unbearable give me a beat and like 15 minutes and I will embarrass you
Don't really care for too many but D is my homie
He in the track he going to hear my baloney
Feel like the Rock and you all are jabronis
Give me my cheese and hold the pepperonis
I'm gone

[Interlude - Futuristic & Devvon Terrell:]
Watch out lil' bitch
Cause Devvon about to come on
Watch out lil' bitch
Futuristic is a very angry black man
Very aggressive
Ahh

[Verse 2 - Devvon Terrell:]
Look at the sky that's a bird that's a plane
Taking me down that shit sounding insane
I am flying higher and running away
From I'm the new guy to watch and you are the rerun
Watch out lil' bitch
Lock up your wife and hide all of your kids
Not that it matters because I'm climbing up on this ladder
You sick and me too I'm rapping sneeze
Bless you, you're nothing special
I want it all and you settle
I am like Mr. Hyde you are like Jekyll
You're making things up that will never be real like Gepetto
It's all about levels
See I am my real voice and you are an echo
I hear you but they're like tho where is that coming from
If you are in front of me I suggest that you run
If you don't here I come
Watch out lil' bitch
Try to be nice but I cannot resist
Taking your order I do you a favor
You are the citizen I am the mayor
Oh yes we can, Barack Obama
When I'm in command, you beating me is not part of the plan
I see you as an enemy catch you with me but I'm not a fan
Watch out lil' bitch
