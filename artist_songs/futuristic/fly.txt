[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
She got a thing for fancy niggas with bankrolls
Big cribs, jacuzzi pools and Range Roves
Walk in closets, just to change clothes
Sounds like she fuck for money, but say she hate ho's
Well that don't make much sense, cause see I've been involved
I got a lil bit of bread, but I ain't finna ball
So unless she know some shit that I don't even know
She fucking with a nigga for connection and my inner thought
She the baddest no exaggeration
The women of my dreams and my imagination
Man she so fine, that she could prolly be a model
Throw a show and raise enough money to end all of the devastation
So what you saying?
I ain't saying that I love her
Just saying that you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover
Yeah, I feel you, but sometimes it be the truth
You should hit it and be done, but do what you gotta do

[Hook - Justin, Senbi Wilson:]
She might be keeping a secret, that you'll never know
But man, if you really love her never let her go
She make me feel fly, she make me fly
She make me fell, uh, uh, she make me feel

[Verse 2 - Futuristic:]
My friends telling me I prolly shouldn't even touch ya
It's too late for that
They ain't say that shit for nothing
So if you got some secrets that you keeping
Let's have an open discussion
We can't function right unless I trust ya
I ain't got nothing to hide baby, I'm falling for ya
You the one that got all of them girls calling for ya
Don't listen to your friend, he mad because he wanted me
Yeah, he said that you was bad
But you're the only one for me
Let's skip this conversation girl I want you bad
Hold on, why, I'll be right back
Came out the bathroom, wearing that Vicki Lingerie
Then she whispered in my ear, in a sexy kind of way
I'm a do that thing you like, until you tell me stop
I'm in her body, like Bugatti's in a parking lot
I hit the spot, she hit the top, and then she dropped

[Hook - Justin, Senbi Wilson]

[Verse 2 - Futuristic, Qiayz La Beastress:]
Hello? What's good, what's popping dude
You still with that one chick, that you was talking to
Yeah brody, I'm telling you she could be the wifey
She make a nigga feel fly, she right beside me
Listen up, I don't wanna burst ya bubble
But I tried to tell you from the jump, she was trouble
You see, my homie threw a party last friday
And said he saw yo chick with another nigga under the covers
What'd you do last friday, when I was out of town?
Just hung out with the girls
Oh, we lying now? You better tell me the truth
Before I fucking lose it
I know where you was at, so please don't say nothing stupid
If you know where I was at then why you asking?
I was at a party with my girls, but nothing happened
I ain't even ask what happened, so why you jump the gun
I heard about the shit you did, I hope you had a lot of fun
Where you going, come back baby
Not now, I'm getting my shit from the room and then I'm out
So don't ever in yo life, try to hit me up
I guess all my friends was right, you a fucking slut
Give me a chance baby, please just stay
I swear to God, if you don't get the fuck up out my way
