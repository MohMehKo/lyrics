[Intro:]
Haha, uh, pardon my tardiness
I was schmangin' hoes I got a fuckin' problem
Yeah, yeah!

[Verse - Futuristic:]
They say I got a fuckin' problem, yeah so?
I'm tryna get brain, scarecrow
Bitches stuck to a nigga like Velcro
And this ain't no girl fight but she tryna get her hair pulled
There go that nigga one take Timmy
When I'm ridin' through yo city got all of my niggas with me
'No Budget' we 'bout to do it me and D-WHY out in sixty
Me and Kyle up in Tempe then off to Houston no Whitney, ah!
My words are so perfect how I assort 'em
I ain't ready for these new kids, fuck it I just abort 'em
Always been the most important, ballin' like Michael Jordan
Got these niggas lookin' up to me but I always been the shortest...
Hmm, I'm lookin' like the nigga that you need to know
Listen and you think about your music how it needs to grow
Come out to a live performance just so you could see the show
Man I'm always recordin' just like your favorite TV show
I look good and even Stevie know, bet that
Travel the country I'm hittin' the stage, jet lag
Ice cold like hockey, red flag
Me against your favorite rapper/celebrity, death match
You a stupid ho, you a you a stupid ho
These niggas is commercial like a motherfuckin' SuperBowl
I save myself I got real people I do it for
Signin' on the dotted line; some shit that make you lose ya soul
I 'Lose Control' just like Missy and Ciara
My flow is so jalape√±o I found it in the Sahara
I ain't with Fat Joe squad but known to bring terror
Every girl is on the voice, Christina Aguilera
[Coughs] I'm coughing cause I'm sickening
All my flows is toxic no pop shit but that's Brittany
2013 I'm shining like a Christmas tree
I won't drop my album until everybody's listening
So get with me or bungee jump with dental floss
Middle finger up to every motherfuckin' boss
I got sauce and I'll spray it on your mom
