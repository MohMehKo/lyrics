[Verse - Futuristic:]
Yo, skipping class, writing raps
I wrote a poem then I put it on the track
I got her back so I put her on her back
Now she got my back any time a nigga talk trash
That's poetic, true, fact
She on my head, Do-Rag
I never really wore a Do-Rag
So I guess that that's not a true, rap
Who Dat? The cat that made 'Who Dat'
W-T-F Gang, inner city new jack
Flew back to New York, five shots, two pack
Got a two pack from all of the shots I threw back
Who's that? I don't really know him
Futuristic is what I really became
I made a name and tatted it on my chest
So to the grave, I'll always be the same
I came with the same crew as last week
Don't ask me for shit
I don't owe you nothing kiss my ass cheek
Keep it moving why you staring when you pass me?
Cause I'm with two girls: Mary Kate, Ashley
Actually, it's Gena and Nicole
I met 'em at the club when I seen 'em on the pole
Took 'em to my home ain't nobody gotta know
Tell my bro' to give me seven minutes then open the do'
Whoa, lemme slow down, it's, about, to go, down
This one-take shit ain't nothing to a pimp
Everybody always ask, wanna know, how
Well, lemme tell you real quick
When I was a lil' kid I was writing all these lyrics
And people looked at me stupid when I told 'em it was music
They said I would never do it but oh shit!
'Look At Me Now' like Chris Brown I'll Busta Rhyme
Waste no time, always gonna' take what's mine
And that's her, so lil' nigga wait yo' turn
You created a beast - Frankenstein
And in the sheets I'm liable to break her spine
That's a love and hate crime at the 'Same Damn Time'
Put my hands around yo' neck don't pay no mind, I'm
Okay if you ask me, you should see for yourself
You say you got a man but you also a big fan, understand
That the plan is to put him on the shelf, well
Give him a call tomorrow
Tell him that the show last night was so dope
But brush yo teeth before you give him a kiss
C'mon now bitch, don't be gross, ho!

[Outro:]
Don't be gross ho, don't be gross ho
