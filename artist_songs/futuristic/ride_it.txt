[Hook - Justin:]
Shawty it's all us, it's gon' be okay
My ex is still on me, but I tell her no way
Cause I love the way you ride it, ride it
I get behind it and grind it, grind it, grind it
Baby you're so raw, so you know I'll come back
Yo ex on you so hard, you say you don't want that
You love it when I grind it, grind it
You get on top and you ride it, ride it, ride it

[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
Baby girl you super bad, just call me fogul
I need yo service everywhere I go, just like T-Mobile
Do what you suppose to, ride me like a rollercoaster
Then I'll put you on the wall, just like my favorite poster
Tell me what it is, what I gotta do to get you back to the crib with me tonight
It's been awhile but you never forget, it's just like riding a bike, and I know what you like
And you know that girl
Why you getting mad about my ex? I can't control that girl
She be tripping she be tripping baby listen baby listen don't pay her any attention at all
I promise that you the only one that I want in my life right now
We move from the bed to the chair to the couch and now we on the ground
Thought we was on a trampoline the way you made it bounce
And I ain't Chris Brown but baby girl let me take you down
And I ain't T-Pain but what you wanna do when I go this hard
And my name ain't Usher but oh my God

[Hook - Justin]

[Verse 2 - Futuristic:]
I know I been gone, but I'm on the flight home then we right back at it
I'm addicted to yo body, like a freaking addict
I wanna taste it, I wanna bite it, like Laffy Taffy
She made it bounce, like Roger Rabit
Drop it like a bad habbit, that's what I like to see
Mistress referee, you gotta earn yo stripes with me
Oh, you playing, I guess you like to tease?
Are you from Nashville? Cause you're the only ten I see
That ain't a pick up line, I already got you
You want a baller and I'm looking like a Houston rocket
She want me to put it in, like a plug in a socket
I got her shaking, got her shaking, like somebody shocked her
I know I'm cocky, but baby I'm legit
We could make a show, I ain't talking Rob & Big
I said I'm cocky, baby girl I'm the shit
So tell yo ex man, he can go jump off a fucking cliff

[Hook - Justin]

[Outro - Justin:]
There ain't no rush, when we making love, bring it back girl
You bad I can't help but touch
All over yo body, all over yo body, baby
All over yo body, all over yo body, girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know what I like, when you, you, you, you do it like that, girl
So, do it like that every time you are with me
Grind it, grind it, grind it
Ride it, ride it, ride it
Do it, do it, do it
To me
