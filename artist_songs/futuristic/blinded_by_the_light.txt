[Hook - Collins:]
Blinded by the lights, waiting for a sign
You thought I was fine, I'm losing my mind

[Verse - Futuristic:]
Yo, I ain't blinded, I'm finally seeing correctly
I had class until niggas started to test me
I surpassed what everybody I knew was doing
They hope to do it, so I help em' do it and then they left me
Ain't that a bitch, literally that's a bitch
Niggas seen the light and then they felt like they just had to switch
I ain't ask for shit, they looking for an ass to kiss
I'm drunk as fuck with a girl I used to fuck, I'd probably grab her tits
I'm smashing in a whip, navigation, the music blasting
Getting head with my girl on the phone, how could I let this happen
Fuck it, I'm extra spazzing, hit the bathroom for a second
Threw up on my jacket and pissed in the liquor section
And I don't even regret it, that's the worst part
Don't have a purpose, I'm doing whatever sounds fun
The music is something I really used to love
But what do you do when your sounds done, I'm found numb
I bought a gun with intentions to blow my brains out
Took my money out the bank and put it all in envelopes
Gave my mama four, gave my brother five, gave my cousin two
Gave my DJ three, I'm trying to get this pain out
I wondered who would come and get the stains out
Or who would hear it, eventually take the same route
I typed a post on my page for all of my fans
I bet if I actually did I'd have the fame now
And niggas still begging me to put em' on, begging me to play they songs
Can't you tell I ain't this shit myself
You don't even like my tracks, you ain't bought one hit
But you mad cause you asked, but won't get my help
Stop it, I got my own situations that I've been facing
These dreams that I'm always chasing, but they rarely ever come true
This family that I left, that woman I used to love
So the least of my concerns is you
