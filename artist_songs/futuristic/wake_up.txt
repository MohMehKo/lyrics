[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
Here I go, here I go, here I go, here I go
They telling me that my fame came overnight
That's kinda funny, I was spitting as a lil kid
Back when I had braces just to fix my goofy overbite
I coulda swore that I was gonna be the Kobe type
Balling in the morning through the day until the cold of night
Until I realized that I wasn't getting taller
Put down the ball and picked up a pen
To make sure that my flow was tight
And now it is, now it is, now it is, now it is
I dare you to trynna tell me it ain't
Got a couple hundred blogs
A million video plays
And big names that say I do my thing
And now I see my dreams, everytime that I'm awake
But I'm on the freeway, it's a couple miles away
Got me speeding down the road, like a high pursuit chase
I'm like an anorexic model, cause I really hate the wait

[Hook - Chanel Arione & Futuristic:]
I know that you been dreaming, but please wake up
And I think, that you should see this, so please wake up
I been dreaming, for all my life
Sitting standby, wating for my flight
I think I need to wake up, I gotta wake up, I'm 'bout to wake up
I been dreaming, for all my life
Sitting standby, wating for my flight
I think I need to wake up, I gotta wake up, I'm 'bout to wake up

[Verse 2 - Futuristic:]
Here I am, here I am, here I am, here I am
It's crazy that these dreams 'bout to come true
See? I been grinding for years, I got my foot in the door
Now I'm about to kick it down, like kung fu
Never dependent on others, they never come through
You couldn't be me, or walk a mile in one shoe
I'm getting calls from these labels
Like do this and do that we'll get back at you
Okay what's new
It's tough dude, but I ain't tripping, I got it
Spent every dollar I had in my pocket at the studio
And now I'm getting good reviews
From these blogs and these websites saying
Futuristic got that stupid flow
Old timers saying I'm better than Coolio
Well thanks, I would hope so
Everybody ask me if I think I'm gonna make it
I tell them I don't think so, I know so
