[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
Became infatuated with your whole appearance
So much that when I talk to you you never hear it
So much that likes on your Instagram make you happy
But I love you in person, made that the clearest
I know I'm busy, but not too busy for you
If I set the table I always set it for two
And if I light a candle I'm trying to set the mood
And if I make a promise I'm always seeing it through but
You obsessed with the wrong things
I know we fight but think you fighting for the wrong team
It's always on me
It's always something that I did or something I didn't do
I feel like I'm in the wrong league
Cause if I ball then we ball together
But if I fall then we fall together
But now it's fuck you's, a bunch of whatevers
If you was cold I wouldn't even give you my sweater

[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
Mama don't like you, she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
But now I know I'm better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Then baby you should go and fuck yourself
And if you think that I'm still holding on to something
You should go and fuck yourself

[Verse 2 - Futuristic:]
I don't need no more fights
Long nights in different rooms
You started problems with fam, now we got issues too
I was blinded by the love cause I was into you
Why'd I stay committed
I know you was with some different dudes
You need attention I get it everyone does
I thought that this was something, I guess that it never was
So every time you call my phone I ignore it
You don't miss me you just bored with the world you chose to explore
Vegas for the weekend
LA on a Thursday
Now you want me back, huh
Want me in the worst way
You won't get a text on Christmas Eve and your birthday
Can't believe I fell for all your games in the first place
And since you like everything that comes with the fame
I wish you luck I'm sure that I'll see you another day
You'll probably snag a rapper or a baller in the game
And I'm a walk right by you backstage, like...

[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
My mama don't like you, she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
Now I know I'm better sleeping alone
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and fuck yourself
And if you think that I'm still holding on to something
You should go and fuck yourself
