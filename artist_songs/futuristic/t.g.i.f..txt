[Verse 1:]
Yo, free clothes, three hoes and a Gatorade
White socks, black chucks, looking like I'm Taylor Gang
Xbox on the bus, just so we can play the game
Banging on my chest after I fuck, just like orangutans
New whip at the crib, but I let my cousin drive
Told him quit his nine to five, niggas gon' be rich for life
Buzzing like a beehive, look into my brother's eyes
Blood thicker than water, I got you, forget them others guys
Jumping in the crowd together, make my mama proud forever
But nobody tell her we got them hoes
And they got down for whatever
Clowning all my homies, all my records is sounding clever
Crowd is getting loud and wilding out like this is heavy metal
After party, yeah, I'm faded, pictures with me, yeah, I'm famous
Haters hating, well, I got security to keep this stainless
These women be getting naked, I got Magnum shit is dangerous
Misbehaving, I'm a make her say yeah just like Usher Raymond

[Hook x2:]
TGIF, thank God I'm Futuristic [x3]
Thank God I'm Futuristic [x2]
Ho

[Verse 2:]
Yo, yeah, stage dives, high fives and some autographs
Big money talking, save them quarters for the laundromat
Told them I was about to blow, then stepped on the launching pad
Now I'm calling shots like I'm a baller yelling, off the glass
Hundred snaps up in my closet, only rocking two or three
Only nigga shining like a star without no jewelry
In my city you'll never hear nobody say, who is he?
Spitting cold flows in hundred twenty two degrees
My team is dreaming and scheming on making millions
I'm heading to the Banks just like Tyra and Azelea
My word done change with the seasons
Like a goddamn chameleon
Speaking green, I'm a motherfucking beast
Godzilla, you the opposite
They say I'll be lost without you, like Robin Thicke
Funny nigga, robbing big, Magic Johnson, positive
I'm sick and ain't no telling when these niggas find a cure for me
But still a nigga prosper and gossiping and they heard of me

[Hook]
