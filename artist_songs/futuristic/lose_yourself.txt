[Verse - Futuristic:]
I'm really startin' to think that this shit was meant to be
I dropped out of school just so I could go make some history
Kinda ironic, remember, I ain't had shit to eat
Pay-as-you-go electricity by the kitchen sink
So I turned them lights off, quick shower I dry off
Pass up on the weed; the music scene what I get high off
IPod full of my songs, they play 'em at the party
If there ain't nothin' to celebrate I hate drinkin' Bacardi but
After a good show, I'm always gettin' faded
Get a fan or two that made it and get both them bitches naked
Man I'm sayin': regular women come with the baggage
But these groupies fall in love and they ain't never even had it
I'm a stick with that, get the cat, show me love and get it back
Crew full of WTF shirts; 'Men In Black'
Supportin' my city for this lil nigga spittin' raps
Workin' hard not hardly workin', rappers wanna get a track!
I gotta tax 'em but that just comes with the business
I lost a lot of friendships for current music commitments
But it's payin' off, A & Rs sayin' I make they favorite songs
And if I wanna talk to a label then I just make a call
I'm takin' off, comparisons comin' and I ain't Drake at all
Rappers call me cocky you got me but please don't take it wrong
If I was less than the best I wouldn't invest at all
Now every dollar I make I put right back in to give to y'all
"Kill 'em all" is the mentality I'm runnin' with
Please tell me a rapper that's made it that I ain't fuckin' with
Lyrical pistol I load it up then I'm bustin' quick
Punchlines uppercut niggas leave 'em with bloody lips
Ha! This too good to be a one-take
For the past two months dropped a video every Sunday
They all had ten thousand plays on Monday
That's a big enough buzz to put my plane on the runway so
I'm comin' to a city near you soon
Thanks to Jake Owens, AKT Aktion and YouTube
The 'I Got Sauce' video my cause was eatin' Froot Loops
Reviews ain't do too well, I guess that mean the true blues
But who knew? You Google my name and there be a hundred pages
Of things that's unrelated so really nigga I ain't made it
But I'm gettin' closer to my dreams, I can taste it
My next album full of great shit that's gon' make me famous
So I'm a tell you just like I told John
Tell a friend to tell a ho to tell your wife to tell your mom
Put this on your CD-ROM, Futuristic is the bomb

[Outro:]
