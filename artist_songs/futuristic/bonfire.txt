[Intro:]
Yo, WTF gang, pow, you know who I be
And um, y'all niggas suck, okay

[Verse:]
Futuristic get the party popping, like a blackhead
All these other rappers now be turning into crackheads
Kill them all, I guess you can call me Mister Black Plague
I be in the street, moving heavy, like a fat leg
With that said, all these haters know I rap ether
They don't listen to a word you're saying, like a bad teacher
I be on the stage, louder than a fat speaker
White girls always call me hot, like a bad Bieber
Justin Bieber, yeah, they biting, like a beaver
Got a freak under the sheets, got that bitch singing like Aretha
Make her shake, call that a seizure
Now she sleep, call that amnesia
I strapped up, don't want no kids
My name ain't [?] Angelina, uh
Hi, Kristina, shout out to my exes
Silly hoes, no you cannot get up on my guest list
I don't date, I just pick up and gon' have sex with
Only see her from the back, it's like I am dyslexic
On to the next bitch, there's alot at every show
Rapping is my lucky charm, I came up on a pot of gold
All my flows is cold, just like I wrote them in a lot of snow
No, all my flows is sick, just like I wrote them with a snotty nose
Know your roll, my nigga, I am the best
My music nasty, like a chick with hairy chest
They call me Mister Clean, cause I am very fresh
And I sneeze alot, I am very blessed
I should stop rapping, y'all niggas can't handle me
I don't scrap, my goons will come and jump you like a trampoline
I just make a lady shake it, something like a tambourine
I be spitting acid, like you squeezing on a tangerine
You a fan of me? That's cool dog, rep the gang
I need some more supporters for this giant step to fame
Tees, hats and chains, so don't forget the name
They tell me I'm the shit, septic tank
I bet you thought that I was finished, cut me off when I be spitting
I'll back hand you, like it's tennis, this is class, pay attention
Bitches, I'm a take attendance
Found this chick out there in Venice, she so bad, she got detention
I be flossing, like a dentist, shining, like a tree on Christmas
Pass the rock, my name is XO, I be balling out in Memphis
In the lab, just like a chemist
Tie your shoes boy, why you tripping?
Wanna battle me? I'll murder you, somebody call forensics
And I'm still not done, bitch, my flow is refreshing, Sunkist
Y'all get swept under the rug, like a crumb, bitch
Y'all niggas can't see me, like a Nun's tits
Dumb shit, I call it stupid flow
Underground? You more commercial than a super bowl
I'm fresher than the soap I'm putting on my loofah, ho
Her name ain't Missy or Ciara, but she lose control
By twenty six I'll be so rich I can retire
Name on every ticket, poster, billboard and flyer
Don't know one single nigga that can see me in a Cypher
Throw all of these niggas in a fucking bonfire

[Outro x4:]
It's a bonfire, cut the lights out
I'm burning everything these motherfuckers talk about
