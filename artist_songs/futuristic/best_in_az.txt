[Intro - Futuristic:]
Yeah, Empire Business, Bootleg Kev, Futuristic, let's get it
Bootleg Kev, you feel me?

[Verse - Futuristic:]
Yo, lately I been thinking 'bout a lotta shit
Mostly how the game is really nothing but politics
But me, I'm with the same niggas I started with
If anybody talking, I leave them dearly departed quick
Gossip and I ain't with it, I handle buisness
You wasn't with me from the begining so mind your buisness
Times is different, your envy showing with every sentence
Tried to ignore it cause to the game I'm so recommitted
Speaking wicked, I'm leaking sickness in all my penship
Speaking interest, I'm interested in collecting interest
Living life so hard I'd die before I get a pension
Futuristic predicted the future, now I live the vision
Penny pension now I'm blowing it all
Went from spectating the game, now I'm knowing the call
Before a nigga had the fame, I had no one to call
But now they see a nigga balling, they get oh-so involved
Fuck it!
I evolved from a nigga who made them stupid songs
Now I'm making the truest songs, feel like I can't do it wrong
Maybe that's because I am no longer scared to lose it all
Now a nigga winning, I feel like I never lose at all
Truest, I'm a changed man, I got the game plans
See it in my eyes, I don't hide behind Ray-Bans
Thought that I was balling when I had about eight grand
Then I made it stretch like the arms on Space Jam
I don't understand why all these rappers hate fans
I kick it with them tops of the bitches that got a great tan
After the show for the people that wasn't there
I spit a rap in they ear just so I can hear them say, "Damn!"
(That nigga Futuristic always snapping, right?
Why he ain't famous, these other niggas ain't half as nice
Maybe he should sell his soul, go and make the sacrifice
Grab a techno beat, dumb it down, then don't rap as tight)
Hmm... I'll pass on that offer if you don't mind
Flow fine, with no tie, did it with no co-sign
If I ain't on before I'm twenty-five I'll have that rope tied
Stand up on the chair and then complete my last nose-dive
Or maybe grab the four-fives, put them up to both eyes
Squezee the triggers, let the bullets penetrate through both sides
No lie, I'm just a musician who got no life
So if this doesn't pan out, why the fuck would I stay alive?
This shit is fucking with me in the worst way
But it's in my blood, that's why I started in the first place
So wrapped up in the music, I fucking lose it
I isolated myself and then forgot my own birthday
Shit! But I'm tryna live comfortable
Shooting for the dream, big family like the Huxtables
Big ass security, so can't nobody fuck with you
I'm the best, they tell me, "can't nobody fuck with you"

[Outro - Bootleg Kev:]
Yeah, they ain't fucking with you, homie
It's Bootleg Kev, Empire Buisness
My man Futuristic the hottest in AZ hands down
You know, we just out here tryna work, man
Tryna build an empire from nothing
I gotta give a big shout-out to everybody out there
My real DJs, man, we still support brand new artists, man
We still break artists, we still break new music
Without the artists having have that co-sign
Or without them having to be on that XXL Freshman cover, man
It's all about supporting good music
For the sake of supporting good music
