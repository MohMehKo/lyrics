Yo, your bitch said I look good, why these niggas hating
Old jealous ass nigga, here's how it work
You gotta take it to the savings, broke ass nigga
Shit's so funny, niggas wanna rap, they all thrash
Boy, you need to quit it, ask around town
Only a few niggas doing it, [?] and Futuristic
Niggas is rich, 10K for a show in my hometown, nigga, that's great
You working minimum wage with a baby on the way
How you living, lil nigga, that's a motherfucking shame
Cause we still get bitches and they all get wild
And they all do drugs, what she want
Said, coke and a smile, that's all she does
Cause I got gold on my neck with my Chucks on
A million plays on one song, what's wrong
WTF for my right arm, picking heat, sidearm

I can bet that I'm flyer than a jet pack
Still got jet lags, with the best raps
All my fans still waiting on the next bach, yeah
And here they go, chasing that dream, tryna reach my goal
In the mean time, freak these hoes
And get dough from the sold out show I throw
I was on the low low, but everybody know now
Whole town and they go around
Bumb through the whole town, oh wow
Big [?] party in that bitch, I ain't even gotta go out

But I ain't know most of the time
I'm the realest nigga that's out
And I ain't even know most of my prime
Came a long way from that Nissan
Drink Bombay, like a pre son
Need no deal, you can keep that
Middle finger up and a peace sign

[Hook - Futuristic:]
I'm young, I'm young and I'm young, I'm young
And I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich, yeah I'm rich
