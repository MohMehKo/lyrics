[Hook - Brielle Marie:]
Day by day, tryna do the best I can
Day by day, day by day, day by day
I get on my knees and pray
Day by day, day by day

[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
Yeah, yo, okay, I messed up but I wanna make it better
Everybody makes mistakes, we gotta get through this together
Got my head on straight, focused on my endeavors
With my grandma spirit on my mind, never settle
Whatever's clever I'm tryna get it, I turned the volume down
But my mom came in to the room
For the rhymes that I have written
I'm sorry to the kids parents that I have offended
They see the letters but not the message that I be giving
It's all forgiven, eventually making history
Just bailed my bro out from state penitentiary
I tell them that it's alright
And even though we got our differences
I love you and I'm here for you at all times
And everybody can't make it in this business
It takes dedication and commitment
Lost a lot of friendships, but gained a lot of fans
One step at the time, I'm a do the best I can, understand

[Hook - Brielle Marie]

[Verse 2 - Futuristic:]
Yeah, I know I disappointed my mama
When I droped out of college
But she should have seen it coming though
Cause I've been writing this music
And performing it since the first grade
But that's never what she wanted though
Until she saw my dreams come to life
She speak what I write, my biggest supporter and I thank her for it
And we've been through some hard times, long fights
When we hated each other but this love, I'm so grateful for it
Hope it never changes, I get older, I see what you did
And take a real woman to leave with the kids
Had to start from scratch, make something of yourself
Never let that devorce, ever hold your back, so I got your back
I know dad was out hoing around
Little bro ain't have a father, I was holding it down
I hope that when you hear this verse you'll smile
Because day by day, I'm trynna make you proud
Tryna make you proud
