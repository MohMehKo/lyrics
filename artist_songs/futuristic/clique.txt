[Intro:]
Uh, I'm in the studio with no shoes on, biiitch
Tahahahahahaha, clique!
You already know who my clique be
Hashtag, WTF Gang lil nigguuuh
I done got my tour shirt
I ain't even on tour but I got my tour shirt
Fuck it, schmang, schmang, schmang
Tell these hoes suck a dick cause I'm schmangin' on 'em
Alright, ya, leggo, ah, ah, leggo
Ummmm, yeah!

[Verse - Futuristic:]
You should know the clique, W-T-F the squadron
Flow outta this world like, Marvin the Martian
Make your girl squirt like a hole on a dolphin
Fucking every beat, I commit rap adult'ry
Talkin', often, that's committin' suicide
Come from Illinois where all these lil' niggas do or die
#YOLO! No bro, video game stupid lives
Call of Duty Future I'm coming back and I'm ruthless guys
Who'll ride? Bet my clique got my back tho'
You spittin' viruses? I'll never catch 'em like a Mac Pro
Feelin' froggy nigga? Leap! Nah, you just a tadpole
Who's your favorite rapper? I get picked more than an afro
Presidents swimming that's cash flow, lame nigga
You all the same niggas, wanna be Drake nigga?
Candy paint nigga, rep my hood to the grave nigga
Even in the slave days I still couldn't hang with' ya'...
Taha! That's fucked up
Droppin' more shit than a goddamn dump truck
Get with' it or shut the fuck up John
