[Chorus - Devvon Terrell:]
I been balling all my life (oh, I been balling all my life)
I been balling all my life, yeah
I been balling all my life (oh, I been balling all my life)
I been balling all my life, yeah
You can call me, I feel like

[Hook - Futuristic:]
Steph, Steph Curry, Steph Curry
Call me Steph, Steph Curry, Steph Curry
Call me Steph, Steph Curry, Steph Curry
Call me Steph, Steph Curry, Steph Curry, sheesh

[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
Yo, I'm balling, swish
Got a team of shooters, homie, you know we don't miss
Daddy was a baller, always knew I'd be a baller too
Both went pro from living dreams, that's something they don't often do
Out in Cali, Golden State
I'm eating, I'm so hungry, you can't hold the plate
Young nigga killing shit, you know them names are gonna hate
The smallest nigga in my city but doing the biggest thangs
Steph Curry with the shot, boy, I'm a motherfucking product
I come through in the clutch, nigga, can't nobody stop him
Allstar better watch him, if they in my way then I drop them
Who you know they got that's popping?
Everybody know there's no other option
Pass me the rock cause you know that I got it, sheesh

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Futuristic:]
I'm out here, the stroke is too smooth
I do this, what the fuck do you do?
If it's a contest, you know Futuristic in first place
You catch two L's like Cool J
You shouldn't have even tried in the first place
If it's a close game, that's the worst case
Cause I show out when I go out
WTF Gang for the blowout
Like Pauly D's here when he grow it out
Drinking too much, I need to slow down
Not an old town, with a hoes clown
If you ain't got money, well, I got money
Cause lately things been sold out
I'm balling, that's balling
Oh nah, fuck do you call it?
I'm ghosting to the finish
Now when I'm winning, I just be stalling
Flow appaling, I'm a go all in
She on my nuts, I'm a hit her with the almonds
Got them all falling, hit them with the crosses
Awesome, young nigga and I stay saucing, sheesh
Long hair with a bandana and a crazy pick
Retro shit with my joggers on
And a sweater that came from eighty-six
You get eighty-six if I say the word
I'm the shit, oh, you ain't seen a turd?
Don't mind if I do repeat my verse
I got millions of plays, this easy work, I'm balling

[Chorus]

[Hook]
