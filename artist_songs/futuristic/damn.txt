[Intro:]
They ask me if I'm balling, balling, balling, balling, balling
I just tell them nah
They ask me if I'm balling, balling, balling, balling, balling
I just tell them...

[Verse 1:]
Yo, don't it feel good to be balling
Everybody want to be a cheerleader
When I'm rapping, I be snapping, you can't snap you got no fingers
I'm the shit, let it linger, ew, that's a stinker
Stay up out my lane, I'm on that one way path, I ain't got blinkers
Girls is winkers, hey baby, I bet I could make you feel fabulous
She kicked it with the squad
We took some pics and now she's tagging us
Liking all of my statuses, saying that she's the baddest chick
I only see her in the night, I guess she's on her Gladys shit
Baddest whips, no not really, I don't even have a car
But call me Travis Pastrana
Cause I can ride my bike with no handle bars
I am a star, no not yet, but yes I'm getting close
I'm just having fun and killing bums with every single flow
I'll let you know that I'm the greatest, cause truthfully I am
I'm tryna get my chips stacked, like they're in a Pringles can
People telling me I'm the man, every color like a box of crayons
I ain't stopping 'til my records get more spins then ceiling fans

[Hook:]
They ask me if I'm balling I just tell them nah
They say I got swag, bitch I got sauce
They ask me how I do it, I tell them I'm the man
Every time they hear me flow all they say is damn
They be like, damn
She be like, damn
I bet that you'll be like, damn
Cause even I be like, damn

[Verse 2:]
WTF that's my fam, you like dubs up, cause that's my jam
All the pretty girls say that's my man
Girl no he ain't, I'll be damned
It feels good to post these videos when people like them
Seeing rappers spit my lyrics
Then they're saying that they write them
Silly boy you should quit it, I had to do it, I just did it
Rock my snap's ain't got no fitted's
That's your chick I already hit it
And it felt good to be truthful, she's older, I'm youthful
Bring a friend I like my girls in two's
Like shoes and toaster strudels
Not too frugal with this money, cause I don't have much
But I've been saving 'bout to buy a keg
With my white friends and get trashed, duh
Find a chick with a fat butt, hopefully she's Asian
Black girls don't understand me
Unless they're mixed with Caucasian
I'm not racist, I'm just saying, baby
I ain't trapping or beating ass
I'm just that hella saucy kid
With crazy flows, that'll make you laugh
But she ain't hearing it, she turned and walked away
But that's okay because her friend is badder and she want to stay

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
They ask me if I'm balling, balling, balling, balling, balling
I just tell them nah
They ask me if I'm balling, balling, balling, balling, balling
I just tell them nah
I am a star, I am a star, I, I, I am a star, I am a star
They be like, I am a star, I am a star
I'm just having fun and killing bums with every single flow

[Hook]
