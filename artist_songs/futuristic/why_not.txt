[Intro:]
Why not? Yeah, I like, I like that shit
Why not? Why not? Why not? Why not?
All this money in my pocket got me

[Verse 1:]
Yo, I copped two bottles and they both for me
Niggas hating and I bag them quick, like groceries
Every track I make's a masterpiece
I make them say, uh, like Master P
I see what niggas is doing, so fuck it, I'm doing it better
They taking what's hot, duplicate it and drop it
They flow be the same, but they're changing their letters
And then they got one line and one verse and one song
That people remember that's clever and they go like this, hold up
My bars so cold, I wear one thousand sweaters
House party at my nigga crib
I never let a side bitch find out where I live
I only fuck with fans, I need a dick rider
I pick her up then drop her off, like a hitchhiker

[Hook:]
Why not? Why not? Why not? Why not?
All this money in my pocket
Made me feel like why not?
Why not? Why not? Why not? Why not?
I know, can't nobody stop me
So I'm yelling why not?
Why not? [x28]

[Verse 2:]
My middle finger up, to let these niggas know
Your bitch sucking on me, like a chicken bone
I hit that shit, then do my happy dance
I'm killing all these rappers, call an ambulance
No, really though, who is you kidding?
Them writtens is awfully shitty
It's twenty fourteen, you rap like Mase and Diddy
There's no marathon, but I'm running my city
You can find me in the club, just like fifty
I'm rubbing her tittes, you not fucking with me
You trying to slang all these singers and models
My nigga, I'm just trying to bang Oprah Winfrey
Play her my song, I know she gon' love it
I hit her at her house, we call that homecoming
Silk sheets, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Squad
Fuck all of that shit that you talking 'bout
I'm never gonna join Illuminati

[Hook]
