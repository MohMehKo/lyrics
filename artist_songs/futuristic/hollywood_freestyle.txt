[Intro:]
Yo, what's good, this the HipHopDX Hollywood Freestyle
It's your boy Futuristic, shmang, shmang, pow, pow
Hide your kids, hide your wife

[Verse:]
Here I go talking shit again, y'all niggas suck, woah
Here you go talking shit again, I don't give a fuck, no
They hating on me in the worst way
I get cake, you ain't never had a birthday
I'm the shit, you act like you ain't never seen a turd before
That was a joke in the first place
I'm just a funny, getting money, pull honeys, like I'm a B guy
Lil kid, nigga, buzzing like a beehive
I'm with my niggas and they hiried in the ski lodge
I never had cold feet, I wear three socks
You wearing knee hops, cause you a bitch, nigga
My name Homie Quan, cause I'm a Rich nigga
And if that make you feel some Type of Way
[?] I bet you, I don't even fucking flinch, nigga
I'm rolling like I'm picking up lint, on fire, I ain't never use flint
I be worth as much as 50 Cent, you gon' be worth like fifty cent
Welcome to my state
When you doing great, you get nothing but hate
And women always throwing at your way
Hop off the bus and pick up a bitch I like elimiDATE
Niggas say they hard, but sweeter than lemonade
From chicken fillet, claiming places that they don't even stay
Numbers don't lie, unless you're paying for your place
Actions speak louder than words, you got a lot to say
But you don't ever do shit, you harlem make moves, bitch
On the roll from looking down on you kids
And I ain't coming back for a while
If you talking, say my name like Destiny's child

[Outro:]
And that's Futuristic, HipHopDX, pow
