[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
Riding through your city you see who I'm with
If you hating on us homie you should quit
She wanna kick it with us, see just how we live
Now she drinking, now she smoking with the kids
My whole squad fuckin' lit
Lit, lit, lit, lit
My whole squad fuckin' lit
Lit, lit, lit, lit, we lit
My whole squad fuckin' lit

[Verse 1 - Devvon Terrell:]
We can smoke or drink it's really nothing
We can go out start a riot everything is jumping
We can stay up from the night until the early morning
We can do just what we want I think we're onto something
I get inside it's whatever feel better, I am on top of the world
And there's nothing that's better than this, I've been spaced with this bitch
Floating and dipping through planets
I see the earth but I'm not landing
God damn it, God damn it, it's hot like the summer Miami
But cold at the top of this planet
Whole squad invited, if you roll up then you light it
Feeling like Tony the Tiger... great
Know that you're the shit when they can't say nothing
Are you poppin' or you are mad or can you say something
No you don't know but you will when you see us coming
I don't want no haters around when I'm just tryna chill
So catch me with

[Verse 2 - Futuristic:]
Off that peach ciroc, someone pass the J
R.I.P the club, that shit passed away
I know I'm the greatest, feel like Casius Clay
Everything I rock, they jock, then I'm on to the next, lil nigga you late (Sheesh!)
I just want it all, hit my squad know that I get it
Nah you ain't gotta wait in line
Just say who you with that's Futuristic
Highly gifted, ultra lit, they know I did it for the city
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me
Like I'm Diddy, bitches showing titties, if I dip, then they all even with me (Sheesh!)
Got another bottle in my hand now, never took hand-outs
Step outside before I stand out
Take another shot, mm, man down
Everybody lit, like fire at a camp ground
They ain't wanna fuck with the kid
Now they trynna chill with the man
Leave a message right at the tone
I'll get back to you when I can
