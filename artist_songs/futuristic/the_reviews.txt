[Verse 1:]
Listen here, I am the best, there's no comparison
Y'all flow is embarrassing, I kill the track, burry it
I'm the greatest, Jason could face it, I'm on that scary shit
And my girl is very thick, while yo chick on that Paris shit
Make yo girl nair the clit, then fuck her with a hairy dick
Ew, that's nasty, you're right dog, I'm very sick
But for some reason, that make her wanna get married quick
While these mouse niggas chase the cat, Tom and Jerry shit
Pimpins in my heritage, not selfish, I could share the bitch
Pick her up, make a lot of swoopes on my Sheryl shit
Boy I run the town, I guess I'm on that sheriff shit
If you on the top I'll knock you down like Keri did
You were not prepared for this, now you are aware of this
Everywhere I go, I get it popping, like Marry did
My jock heavy, I bet that you couldn't carry it
Break all of the records, then retire like Barry did
I'm different, y'all common like the name Larry Smith
And my flow is nasty, like a chick that got some hairy tits
You want a diss track? Go ahead, dare me bitch
If this was 8 Mile, then you're looking like Clearance did
I'll smack the moustache off of ya hairy lip
Got a lot of problems never solved them with my therapist
These drugs are all impairing him, he's needing better parenting
Radio is airing this, Futuristic's arrogant

[Hook:]
Oh my God, he's so cocky, but I really like it
Ay, fuck that nigga, he ain't fucking with Lil B cause, based God
He sounds just like Childish Gambino
Gosh, find your own swag, dude, fuck off
What can I say, he's dope, Futuristic is on fire
It's been interesting watching him grow
With this from his first video to where he stands today
It's just a matter of time before this kid gets signed, duh
Go Future, you're so dope

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, I thought I told you lil niggas, I just do me
Boy, I'm in my zone like a hoop team in two three
Me and Jay Boy in the hoopdy with groupies
Don't like it? Then sue me, I do me, so do she
Oopsies, they tell me that I poopie on the best
I don't need to cash a check or throw a chain around my neck
I make good music, got cash money my jams def
And I do it by myself so you better show respect
I don't need these labels that be gaming all the rest
Just to tell me how to rap or fucking tell me how to dress
And tell me to get a nose job so I can look my best
And ask for blowjobs and cheesecake
While they're behind their desk, nah
I ain't with that, break them like a Kit Kat
My raps ill, you been wack, so yo tracks we skip that
Fresher than a Tic Tac, go harder than a six pack
You bitch made, like girls dogs, I get pussy six cats
Sick raps from the mind of an ill poet
I'm fucked up, I try to hide it but still show it
And you will notice, behind the lens, I'm the real focus
Patient and still focused, been waiting to kill showbiz
Dopest rapper that you ever heard, duh
Wait, you ain't heard of me nigga?
What the fuck, is you doing with yo life, lame boy
This is real music, so if you feel it then make noise

[Outro:]
Futuristic keep this up
This is how people become legends, I'm stunned
I listened to this song for about three seconds
And I was blown away, get this now
Oh my God, I can't believe I went to the same high school as you
Whether Mr. I Had To Do It is going hard on a verse
Or delivering a smooth hook, Futuristic does not disappoint
Futuristic is not your average new rapper
What separates him from the pack
Is his lyricism and professional delivery
Futuristic is on his grind to make it
As he described in a recent interview
Music is my life, I don't know what the fuck I'd do without it
