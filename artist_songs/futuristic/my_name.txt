[Futuristic:]
As long as you say my name
As long as you say my...

They say I sound like Big Sean, Childish Gambino, even Luda
With Hopsins facial expressions, nigga get off your computer
I'm just me nigga
You'll see nigga
WTF my team nigga
Big dreams I'm about to achieve nigga
So get with it or leave nigga
See nigga come on, you heard like one of my songs
Saying I don't have substance listen to me your thoughts are wrong
I just stated my to on this track?
Only my real fans are going to get that
My manager told me not to say y'all suck
But really man all your shits so wack
I got no chip on my shoulder, maybe I'm just a hater
But I feel like I'm on the top floor and you're on the elevator
I got a super team like I'm Kobe on the Lakers
And we're just trying to get this paper
Like we're on the movie Takers
I got no fakers in my circle
Y'all reenact like commercials
With all of your Barney flows only talking about green and purple
I'm pretty certain I'm the futuristic you should know
Some people scream like they're favorite team just won the Super Bowl

[Hook:]
They call me wack but they know I'm great
Flow so real but they call me fake
When I rap slow they call me Drake
But I ain't worried about a thing
As long as you know my name
As long as you say my name

They say I'm cocky that might be true
Say I do things that I really don't do
They call me him, I'm not you
You should know that I'm that dude
They always saying my name
As long as you know my name

[Futuristic:]
They call me cheesy because I don't rap about drugs like Young Jeezy
Believe me, all these white kids in my city want to be me
That's some cool shit, They like "dudes sick"
Nigga hell yeah my crew big
I got girls stuck to me like glue sticks
Lyrics in their mouth like toothpicks
So... call me what you want
A hundred thousand disagree
Shut up, wait a year and then turn your channel to MTV
Look around your city and see a flyer of me?
Look in your girls closet and find a Futuristic Tee... shirt
I'm working to make it perfect in every way
21 I'm still not in my prime get better everyday
The hate, I let it go but y'all say some shit I would never say
Like calling me a faggot, that's tragic, what if I was really gay?
I'm not, but my sister is that's a mean word
Sticks and stones could break bones but damn words still hurt
So... call me wack if that's how you feel, I ain't tripping
As long as you say my name I know that everybody listening

[Hook:]
They call me wack but they know I'm great
Flow so real but they call me fake
When I rap slow they call me Drake
But I ain't worried about a thing
As long as you know my name
As long as you say my name

They say I'm cocky that might be true
Say I do things that I really don't do
They call me him, I'm not you
You should know that I'm that dude
They always saying my name
As long as you know my name
