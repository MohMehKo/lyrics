[Hook x2 - Jerrin Jaramillo & Futuristic:]
Do dreams come true, I'm living mine and you can too
Dream big, I, I dream big, dream big, I, I dream big

[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
Sold out shows in every state
People lining up, tryna get it, they can't wait
I can't shake this feeling that I've been having
My goal is around the corner, I got to reach out and grab it
I'm a beast, I'm a savage, I am not a rapper
More of a story teller, this only the first chapter
Bet the thing end with a happily ever after
Shining like a diamond, I'm smiling, nothing but laughter
I'm after money, clothes and all of that
Fast cars, women that love it and they acknowledge that
Speaking of knowledge, man I'm like a walking almanac
Records get more spins than clothes at a laundromat
So fall back or hop on the bandwagon
Nike kicks, plaid shirt, pants sagging
No bragging, I stay fresh, ziplock
Time ticking, I'm in it, look at the wrist watch

[Verse 2 - Futuristic:]
Since I was little I been dreaming just like Mister King
Kobe Bryant before the titles, I need a ring
I built my buzz from the ground up, ain't need a team
Now my squad got me, we growing with every single tweet
They ain't seen nobody this hungry since Kobayashi
Rapper's trash, yeah their flows get thrown away like old salami
I'm the shit, everywhere I go like a Port-A-Potty
Trying to get my paper no folds like origami
Hotter than pastrami, but y'all ain't heard of me
All my cuts I've made them with precision like a surgery
I remember when this girl wouldn't say a word to me
Now I don't mean she dancing when I say that girl is jerking me
Certainly she wanna flirt with me, I'm blowing up
Everywhere we go they screaming loud cause they know it's us
They know what's up, these dreams turned into reality
I'd like to say fuck anybody who done ever doubted me

[Hook - Jerrin Jaramillo & Futuristic]

[Verse 3 - Futuristic:]
See? I been grinding since a young age
I be up late, trying to get my videos all up on the front page
I'm in school but I'm sitting at a tough place
I'm already major, this music street is a one way
What a shame, the greatest he ain't signed
I'll ghost write for Gucci anytime he need a rhyme
They super wack, I state the facts, I'm out of line
Only twenty now, but I feel like I'm running out of time
Not in my prime, but still harder than all
I'm just trying to ball, tall, like gasol
Plaques on the wall, with my name all on it
Round table, main hitters, that pay homage
So honest, I'm a beast out my cage
Need a leash, got beef? Be deceased in the grave
So you can hate but just know that I'm amazing
And keep bumping every track, I'm blazing
