[Verse 1 - Devvon Terrell:]
I be sittin' high, so motherfuckin' high, I'm like the sun when I'm coming down (coming down)
Got a lot of enemies, watching niggas go when I'm chillin' with my hoes (don't say shit)
And everybody knows, I'm a pro like a con when he tryna get that money baby (better have my money)
Or what I'm trynna say is, I'm the type of motherfucker you should not be

[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
Playin' with, uh, come get the best of me
Playin' with, uh, come get the best of me

[Verse 2 - Devvon Terrell:]
I've been swinging hard, so motherfuckin' hard
I'm Tiger Woods when I go for par (go for par)
Nobody can mess with us, feeling like I'm Prince Akeem in "Coming To America" (living like a king)
And everybody knows, I'm a boss, not a clown cause I don't see nothing funny baby (nothing funny)
Or what I'm tryna say is, I'm the type of motherfucker you should not be

[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
Playin' with, uh, come get the best of me
Playin' with, uh, come get the best of me

[Verse 3 - Futuristic:]
Yo, I'm like the worst kid on the team
I promise you don't wanna play with me
If you think you can handle it, than you livin' in make believe
I'm Dr. Jay in '83, pull up a chair and take a seat
Even with a rope around your neck you couldn't hang with me
You fuckin' with a nigga, who's proven that he can do it
My attitude 'I ain't mad at you, but have to leave you ruined'
When you rappin' with other rappers that lackin' making improvement
They get mad at you for passin' though and cashing damn it's stupid
I am not human, I might just lose it
Flow is so sick you would think I had lupus
God I'm a mute it
Taking these shots like I'm cupid
Call of Duty got 'em wounded
What is you doing, I'm winnin' you losin', I know that you trying to use me to come up
I work through the night I don't quit till the sun up
Vacation, don't take them I work in the sauner
Then I hit the stage everybody be jumping
They knew that I run it
I was up and coming, but now I'm that nigga
They know that I'm buzzing, they look at the numbers
Wonder how I done it
Soon as I come in I'm getting respect
If you try to flex then I come at your neck
Verified nigga I'm about my checks
And I get what I'm worth and I take nothing less, man
I Guess what I'm trynna say is, I am not the type of nigga that you should be

[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
Playin' with, uh, come get the best of me
Playin' with, uh, come get the best of me
