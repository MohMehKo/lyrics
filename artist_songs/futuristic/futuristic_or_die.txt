[Verse:]
Futuristic, or share a needle with Magic Johnson
Futuristic, or go swimming with the damn piranhas
Got beef and you'll get ate, like this is Benihana
Try to hide it, I will find it, murk you like bin Laden
Yeah, I got it, fuck all of these other rappers
Watch me turn a emcee into a cadaver
I'm flyer than Aladdin, already fucked Jasmine
She got my name tatted, nigga, you could have it
Music blasting, bump this, or suck a dick
Mr. I Had To Do It, or go jump off a cliff
Cause I'm the shit, no flushing, disgusting
Punchlines hit you in your stomach, like crunches
It's me, or let it burn, like Usher
Bust in her mouth, like a Gusher, hush up
Shut the fuck up, I'm sick, I need Theraflu
It's Future in this bitch, or skydive with no parachute
I'm doing what I'm doing, these motherfuckers is hating
I got deals that's on the table, they straight, but a nigga waiting
I tell them, give me your black card, or slit your fucking neck
You coming at me reckless and it's straight disrespect

[Outro:]
It's Futuristic, or die, It's Futuristic, or die
It's Futuristic, or die, It's Futuristic, or die
So, get the fuck up out my ear with all that lame shit, nigga
Cause I don't give a damn who you came with, nigga
It's Futuristic, or die, It's Futuristic, or die
It's Futuristic, or die, It's Futuristic, or die
So quit acting like you something
When I can tell that you ain't nothing
