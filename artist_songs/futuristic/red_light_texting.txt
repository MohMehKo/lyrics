[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
Shoulda never gave you the upper hand
And now you got me saying words I don't understand
Baby I'm on my way
I'm at this red light texting what I wanna do
Cause when you say, I know I got it where you want it
Girl everytime you say, I know that we there
Girl tell me why, why, why every light's stopping me
I'm red light texting you babe

[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
I love it when you send smiley faces after every sentence
I gotta bottle in the whip if you wanna get faded baby, is you with it
You said you had a bad day, let me fix that
Let me hold you, girl I know you miss that
Kiss that spot it will never happen this fast
Twist that, got a glass left baby sip that
It's all gone, you dancing let me put your song on
You singing them words all wrong
And coming onto me all strong
I don't wanna take advantage but, I've been waiting for a minute girl
I've been wanting this moment ever since I got your digits

[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
Shoulda never gave you the upper hand

[Verse 2 - Futuristic:]
What's your favorite movie? That's kinda lame but uh, let's watch that
But I can't stop looking at you, so pause, matter of fact stop that
Your eyes are super pretty, and your smile is cute
Your demeanor is sexy and so are your shoes
But um, take them off would ya, they make you tall and I'm kind of a short guy
You biting your lip, put my hand up on your hip and I'm all up on your neck like a bow tie
You the truth that's no lie, even when you wanna [?] you're so fly
I've been wanting this moment since I was texting you sitting at the red light

[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
Shoulda never gave you the upper hand
And now you got me saying words I don't understand

[Bridge - Devvon Terrell:]
[?]
Bright lights through the city
I'm driving to, get to you
Get out the way
Can't wait to get to you, baby
So many red lights
That I've never seen before
Oh I'm texting and driving
And I don't care if I'm wilding
I'm trying to get to you baby
I'm not trying to get arrested
But I can't help red light texting

[Verse 3 - Futuristic:]
Give me the green light, John Legend
You ask me if I got protection, I say "I do" like it's our wedding
I been texting you I can't wait to get next to you
Your panties on the floor and the door is closed so [?]
Every red light you get more anxious and I get a little closer
Now you on the sofa, so I could hold ya
And do everything that I said that I would show ya
You already know that I'm about that life, I
Bet you wanna do this every night, right?
You cooking and you cleaning and you texting that you need it
I believe that you may be my type

[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
Shoulda never gave you the upper hand
