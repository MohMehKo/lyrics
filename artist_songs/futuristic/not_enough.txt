[Verse 1:]
This peach CÃŽROC is like therapy
It's kinda strange, but when vodka's in my veins
It brings the most clearity (faded)
Stumbling out the club with a girl that wanna marry me
I'm just tryna fuck one last time
The day I go back to you will be the day they have to bury me
But I love you
Baby, please come back
We're supposed to be together
Fuck that
I'm lit, take a sip with a chick at the crib, she unzip, then it's in
Her lips on my dick, if they slip then it's it
Got a kid, I don't trip, if your shit is legit
Just did a show, on the road, it's my home
I was fucked up, slurring every word that I spoke
And my fans all know, but my fans all dope
In the stands going ham cause my fans all smoke
I guess I will for the night
Bombay and sprite
Raw papers for the high
Got my eyes red like a nigga just got into a fight, go!

[Hook:]
They say I drink too much
They say I drink too much
I think it's not enough
They say I drink too much
They say I drink too much
I think it's not enough
Not enough
Not enough
Not enough

[Verse 2:]
Been through a whole bottle
By myself, what a role model
Full throttle, show stop, I'm a whole papa
Like my papa, man, that's awful but it's so proper
Fuck up, and you fired, I'm the old donald
Throwing shots, better duck, that's the old donald
In the community and shit, that's the old donald
Got your girl cheeks rosy, that's O'Donnell, whoa
She driving fast, I hope she don't crash
I'm smashed, but I'm focused on that ass
I ain't even say nothing funny, but she laughed
On a scale from one to ten, she like a twelve and a half
I told her that all I have time for is cash
She told me some fucked up shit about her past
I told her, "it's all good now, just relax"
Poured some vodka in her glass and it splashed, drink that
No, for real, drink it
What do you mean you don't drink?
Okay, give it here
Go!
