[Hook - Jerrin Jaramillo:]
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one if you want me to
And anywhere I would've followed you
And say something, I'm giving up on you

[Verse - Futuristic:]
A lot of stress, she was a mess and I cleaned it up
You needed stuff and I needed something a little different
Say something, say anything, make a face, hold my hand
Kiss my lips to show that you really is committed
Four years is a lot of time, should we dismiss it?
Forget it and live as if it never existed
Emotions, I'm hopeless, it came to grow consistent
Turned a friendship into love, but now that love is sort of distant
I never thought I'd see the day I couldn't make you laugh
Couldn't make you smile, couldn't even make you mad
It's kind of like you're a cast or a mold
Or something from the past that I used to have
I'd do anything to get you back
And you would do anything just to get me back
I guess that's how it is
They say it's better to have loved and lost
But now I feel lost and I don't wanna live
Say something, say that you forgive me
Tell me that you believe me
Have faith that we can make it, I know that it won't be easy
But we could find a way back into that passion
Feel the word love and get lost in the meaning
Put you before me, your wants and your needs
My dreams include every bit of you
I wouldn't say it if it wasn't true
All you gotta do is tell me that you love me too
Say something

[Hook - Jerrin Jaramillo:]
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love
And I'm saying goodbye
And say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
And anywhere I would've followed you
And say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something
