[Hook 1 - Devvon Terrell:]
You waiting in L.A, I'm walking down the stars
I had a lot to drink, Tell me your not that far
I know you do your thing, you out here going hard, but I just wanna know if you wanna text and call an
Uber to my place [x8]

[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
Yo I'm way too drunk right now
And you way too drunk right now
I ain't gotta say much, here's the addy you already know wassup right now
I got a little bit of weed, I don't smoke much but I'm with it if you wanna do it
That booty need a tutor because the way that you maneuver it when you juke it it's really kinda stupid
Body so foolish, you had everybody drooling, I know that you was choosing
Last time, that look in your eye make a nigga heart stop, Flatline
I could teach game like it's halftime, I'm the house on the corner don't pass mine
I already know what you want don't front baby girl you don't even gotta act shy
I got that shit that make any chick go insane
Take off your clothes I wanna know just how you taste
I grab your hair I put my hands on all your waist
You feel so good I really think that you should stay
You ain't even gotta dip out, it's just me ain't nothin' to trip about
I ain't got a girl or nothin, I mean you really something
It would be cool if you stick around
You could wear my T-shirt if you want
We could smoke like one more blunt
You could rest your head on my chest
In the mornin' the car gone be out front like

[Verse 2 - Futuristic:]
Feelin kinda faded, I probably shouldn't drive
Hope that you can make it, I'm a call you a ride like
Ba-doop!
Scoop you up it'll be outside in about 15
And I got that liquor that you like let it freeze
If you still wanna drink with a nigga like me
Cause I've been thinking about you
But we've both been busy
It's been a month without you, never in the city
But there's just something about you
That's different and I need that
I got a big T-shirt you can keep that
I'm anxious now like where you be at?
I wanna bite your neck, you can scratch my back
While I go real slow
I can grab your waist, while you get on top like the rodeo
I wanna kiss your lips while I grip your hips
Then I pull your hair
I'm a make you scream til the neighbors
Hear but I really don't care
When the morning comes, I can make you breakfast
In the kitchen flexin', we can have another session
But then I gotta dip, got another trip, kick it at the crib, I'll be back for you
Got another show, I'll be on the road, just want you to know
That's what I have to do
