[Intro:]
Yo, this the Raise The Bar Cypher, Futuristic

[Verse:]
Yeah, my flow is the dopest, you can roll it up and smoke it
No, bitch, my flow is the coldest, you need mittens just to hold it
And I'm flyer than a locust, Watch The Throne, just call me Otis
Got that magic stick, so now yo chick is on that Hocus Pocus, hah
My bad, I'm about to blow like Iraq
She left, she coming right back and I touch her like an iPad
You can't see me, you should go and get your sight back
I'm on a roll, like I'm on a hill, you sitting still, like a bike rack
My swag got hijacked, that's cool, have that
I got that sauce, now everybody want it, like a grab-bag
Carry the game, on my shoulders, like a backpack
What I say goes over all they heads, like a snapback
Push your cap back, go ahead and fold the brim
Shit, I'm looking fresh and they dusty rocking the oldest Tim's
Laughing at these rappers, I'm snapping, I can't control my grin
Like Lil Wayne and Drizzy Drake, Futuristic going in
Awesome, raping the track, say what I want, I ain't taking it back
I'm the original, never subliminal
Pick on the rest, like a name in a hat
Speaking the truth, I've been stating the facts
Take from a fanny pack, bringing it back
Rich ol' big, go biggity, biggity, biggity, biggity, biggity, bap
I can say nothing and still shit on you
All I do is floss, nigga, something like a dentist do
And to society, I'm a fucking menace, dude
I got the game tied down, like tennis shoes

[Outro:]
Calling out yo mama, bitch
