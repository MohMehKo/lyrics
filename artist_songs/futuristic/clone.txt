[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
I been chasing my dreams and now it seems
That I'm finally getting everything that I always wanted most
Left you behind I know, time moving slow, you turned to drugs
I'm hoping and praying that you, don't overdose
Wanna hold you close, but you making it impossible
This fame is just an obstacle, I thought that we could move past
You say you love me, but somehow you got another man
Damn, I just left, I guess that you move fast
I understand that you don't wanna be alone
But this is a broken home, I don't know if it's worth the repair
All I know is, that I'm missing all your kisses
Making love until the morning
While my fingers running through your hair
And you just scared, that I'll forget about you, let me tell you
Yeah, I party, baby, but I know how to control myself
I wish that I could be two places at the same time, I need to find
I need to find a way that I can clone myself

[Hook - Jerrin Jaramillo:]
Yeah, I know I been gone, I left you all alone
I'm on the road, wish I could be home, no, wish I could do both
I think I need a clone, I wish I had a clone, I think I need a clone
I'm on the road, wish I could be home, no, wish I could do both

[Verse 2 - Futuristic:]
My grandmomma getting sick, it make me wanna quit
Drop everything and go and take care of her
It would eat me alive, if she died and I wasn't right by her side Showing that I was there for her, see?
She raised me from a pup, ain't give a fuck, that I was black and she was white and her friends was gonna hate her for it
And if this her last day, I'm a give her everything she ever wanted
She should be able to enjoy it
We could talk for hours, all she want is company
Fried chicken, Coca-Cola and good conversation
She ninety seven, she don't understand technology, fashion
Or even rapping, but she know that it's my occupation
I'm just saying, I love her so much it hurts
It makes me laugh, when she wears her Futuristic shirt
I hate the fact, I'm on the road and she's at home alone
Times like this, make me wish I had a fucking clone

[Hook - Jerrin Jaramillo]

[Outro - Jerrin Jaramillo:]
I'm a tell you like this, I'm a tell you like this, I wish I was home
When I'm on the road, I know that you're there all alone
I wish that I could find, a way to make it right
To be there next to you, for now a clone will have to do
