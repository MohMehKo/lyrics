[Intro:]
Oh, look at the money that we throwing
Bottles that we popping, hoes that we be pulling
Look at the whip that we just rode in
Clothes that we be rocking, you already know this

[Verse 1:]
Between the shows, the hoes, free clothes
The flows that had everybody out there like
Woah, you're freaking dope, I swear that I'm your biggest fan bro
You should put me in your band, dog, I'll play the bango
Do you and your friends smoke, cause homie I could blaze you
Dang, that sounds tempting big guy, but no thank you
It's cool I'll talk to you soon this chat was great Fut
Cool it with the nicknames, talk to you later lame dude
Okay, it's funny damn they acting like they know me
A year ago you was phony, now you wanna be my homie
And way back she would ignore me, even said I was corny
But now, she at my crib with three friends, we having a orgy
Oh geez, my head is growing by the minute
Cause my chain is hella frozen just to hold it I need mittens
In the V.I.P. just sipping pulling bitches looking cool
Like I forgot about my mission I was sent out here to do

[Hook:]
Oh, look at the money that we throwing
Bottles that we popping, hoes that we be pulling
Look at the whip that we just rode in
Clothes that we be rocking, you already know that, it's on
But I forgot where I was going, I got caught up in the moment
I forgot where I was going, I forgot where I was going
I got caught up in the moment, I forgot where I was going

[Verse 2:]
Yo, I'm on stage and all these pretty girls is flashing me
I forgot the words, I can't believe this shit is happening
They calling me Future, like my name ain't really Zachary
I took her to the room and then I fucked her on my balcony
True story, I was thinking back
Me and MGK was signing autographs on shoes and hats
And me and Yung Berg killed a bottle in the back
And Afroman left the concert, bumping one of my tracks
Fact, Yelawolf ain't show no love where we was at
I should of hit his punk ass but his security was strapped
Fuck that, E-40 said I did my thing though
Plus I smashed this chick I used to jack off to on Bang Bros
She left the next day wearing the same clothes
Yeah, I go hard but niggas still gonna hate though
What I'm trying to say is that the fame is almost there
But in the midst of things I almost forgot why I was here

[Hook]

[Outro:]
I got caught up in the moment...
