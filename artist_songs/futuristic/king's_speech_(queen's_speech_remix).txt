Always talk shit
But my breath don't stink
Flow been running
Better rest my sink
Cooking these niggas
Got the recipe
If they mess with me
Rest in peace
Got drive like Uber
Never Let the headrest
Mic always on
Like a bald dude with a headset
Hit it till she squirt
Damn got the whole bed wet
Rock Out like Led Zep
Uh, one take what I do
Who you?
Look at your whole crew
I don't know who's who
You look confused
Think you need a blues clue
2 girls, 1 Cup
You niggas is doo doo
All about business I need
A new suit
4 us by us
My label is
FuBu
Microwave a nigga
If he think he too cool
I'm a misfit
Like I switched to a new school!
Upload a pic to the gram
Yo girl with my dick in her hand
Gross
You should just stick to the plan
You could sink quick in the sand, Whoa
I know you a bitch, Mulan
You could get folded, futon
Every girl want the noodle, Udon
Going hard for the green, Cruton
Now I could see why you stressed
Now I could see why you stressed
Cause your life is just like my
Little brother's room
Because that shit is a mess
I know that I am the best
There's something I need to confess
I still use an iPhone 5
But somehow I got success
I be out in Cali
In the valley
Making money
Do my dougie
Cause it's funny
Sip a lot of tea
With honey
Make em jump
Like it's a bungie
Shitting on em' need a huggie
Flow is cold
I need a snuggie
Now my pockets
Getting chubby
All these women wanna touch me
Cause I'm cuter than a puppy
And It's like I won the lotto
Cause I'm always getting lucky
Now she licking my banana
Like a motherfucking monkey
And she not having my baby
But she feel me in her tummy!

Let a nigga breathe!
All these sick words in my notes
I think my phone has got a disease
My flow I'm Mufasa
Long live the king!
I feel like Mohammad Ali
Fly like a butterfly
Sting like a bee!
Okay I'm back now
You an ass clown
Whatever that means?
You couldn't walk in my shoes
Like you a skinny dude and I got fat feet
Never been in the backseat
You probably live in a taxi
My flow is oh-so proactive
And I ain't never had no pimples, nigga!
