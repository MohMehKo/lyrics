[Intro:]
He's so crazy, they say I'm crazy than a motherfucker [x3]
He's so crazy, they say a nigga so crazy

[Verse 1:]
So crazy they straight jacket me love it when niggas laugh at me
If you wanna scrap you'll need a titan to tackle me
Yeah I'm in front with 'bout 20 niggas backing me
It's gon' be a mystery, they need Scooby and Daphne
What's happening, shit a nigga better check the horoscope
All these lights flashing, I'm thinking this shit is morris code
Pill popping animal, hope a nigga don't overdose
Futuristic robot flow, hope he don't overload
I'm a go postal, Marco Polo, more ho's than a garden
That's superbad fogul, y'all local, I'm global
So I got my fans screaming every single vocal
Y'all hopeful, I'm flyer, I'm balling, you're retired, I'm fresh, check my attire, I'm the Donald
You're fired

[Hook:]
I'm so crazy, so crazy [x4]
I'm going dumb, I'm going stupid, I'm so I'll, I'm 'bout to lose it
He's so crazy, they say I'm crazy than a motherfucker [3x]
He's so crazy, they say a nigga so crazy

[Verse 2:]
I'm so unusual, kill them they need a funeral
All these other rappers is squares, they need a cubical
I'm the shit bitch eat a dick, pubical
That ain't a word, but they gon' bite it like a cudical
Future do that shit, that other niggas never thought to do
I be going ham, like the sandwich that you brought to school
I'm a keep on flowing, like the lazy river at the pool
And she's gon' keep chilling with me
Cause she thinks I'm super cool
No pun intended, bitches, I'm a fucking kill this shit
More bars than a prison, I got more cars than a dealership
Wild sex, make her whip her hair, just like Willow Smith
Then back to making money, got more paper than a syllabus
Ugh, yeah welcome to the class, ho
I'm the shit, like I'm coming out an asshole
That's nasty, like fucking a fat ho
I wouldn't know about it, but that shit'll make you laugh though

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I'm so Futuristic, F is fuck bitches, U is for u suck, T is for truly gifted
U is for u suck, R is for really nigga, I is for I ball, S is for silly nigga
And TIC is ticking time bomb about to blow at anytime
It's like I sell shoes, I'm always at the finish line
You got beef, then I'm a treat you like it's dinner time
All my flows is cold as ice, it's like I'm spitting winter time
I'm a go crazy, Slim Shady, champion flow, Tom Brady
I'll, sick, spit rabies, let me introduce myself
Dick, ladies, records spin, ten eighty, take a seat, boy lazy
Who's line is it, anyways Wayne Brady
I got one motto, fuck you pay me

[Hook]
