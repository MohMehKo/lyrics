[Intro:]
Alright, yeah, yeah, no such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, yeah, yeah, can I get my vocal turned up a lil bit?
Yo, yo, yo

[Verse:]
Consumed by the music, wrapped up in competition
Following rappers careers and wondering how they did it
Seeing material things and wishing that I can get it
And then it set in, I gotta be more realistic
Not everybody can be Drake or J. Cole, what you aim for?
Nigga, we ain't got the same goals, I want a life that's paid for
By the things that I love
Paitience is a virtue but I think I've waited enough
It had me stressed out, question, should I keep striving?
Keep putting videos out and hoping these kids find me
Keep taking meetings with labels knowing they ain't gon' sign me
Texting rappers that I met knowing they ain't replying
My grandma dying and I'm touring around the country
Smoking with niggas I don't know until I get the munchies
Meeting bitches at every city that wanna fuck me
My girl at home ain't used to that, it's hard for her to trust me
Plus I don't even post pictures of us at all
I was tryna keep an image, a nigga that spit it raw
She don't say much, pretending she ain't see the things she saw
And she hear it from her friends, girl, yo nigga is a dog
That's the truth and the truth hurts, we dated young
Before I was old enough to even step foot in the club
Before I was old enough for cigarette smoke in my lungs
Now we done, but you someone that I know I always loved
And if I ever love again, best belive it's gon' be pure
Don't commit until I'm sure, nights we spending on the floor
Having conversations, how we got alot, but still want more
Give her flowers, give her kisses, reconfirm the fact I'm yours
Open yours, kiss you on your forehead when I say goodnight
Suprise you from time to time and sure, it was something nice
I text you when you at work, with something to make you laugh
Accpet you knowing your past and give you the greatest life, love
I can feel it in my bones
Twenty fifteen gon' be special, I can feel it in my soul
And I'm happy with the fact, that I did it on my own
And I'm proud I moved to Cali, it's starting to feel like home
Accepting responsibilities, mama, your boy is grown
Don't stress over anything you know you can't control
Hateful feelings get the best of you, you gotta let them go
You got three kids that love you, so you'll never be alone, love
Love yourself in the world you currently live in
If it don't make you happy, then go do something different
If you be fucking up, then start improving your decisions
If you on the brink of suicide, just sit back for a minute
Think of everyone around you, think 'bout how it would affect them
Think 'bout where you might going
Think 'bout life that you neglected
Think 'bout what you can do better and get out of that depression
Drop those pills, put down that bottle
And please, drop that fucking weapon, it's real
I hope that someone takes this shit as a sign
And my lines could have a purpose, be engraved on they mind
Give a vision of blind, make them listen, rewind
Reflect on they situation and compare it with mine
Realize I'm just a person who's rapping but we the same
Scratch the money, scratch the fame, we still feel the same pain
Tryna maintain and hold on to the things that make us sane
In the words of Jermain, there's...

[Outro x2:]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing
