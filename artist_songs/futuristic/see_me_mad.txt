Nice guy back again, always comin' with a smile on my face
I used to pass CDs out in school, go to the bathroom and then find them in the waste
You couldn't walk a mile in my pace, you couldn't live in an hour in my space
I was helpin' mom pay for college, raised my lil bro and put flowers in the vase, goddamn
How can you hate on me doin' me? How could you foolishly call me a faggot not knowin' what that shit could do to me? How could you threaten my life on the internet, talk about stabbin' and shootin' me?
When I had some niggas and they would pour lighter fluid on my back and jump me back in 2003, I threw punches to leave

You don't wanna see me mad, you don't wanna see me spaz
You don't wanna see me glad, you don't wanna see me laugh
You don't wanna know my past, you don't wanna know my thoughts
They don't know who I am, only pickin' out my flaws
You don't wanna see me mad, you don't wanna see me spaz
You don't wanna see me glad, you don't wanna see me laugh
You don't wanna know my past, you don't wanna know my thoughts
They don't know who I am, only pickin' out my flaws

I was gettin' suspended for fuckin' up any kid that called me a nigga because I was raised in a racist home
My grandmother was white, when I was born, she wouldn't claim me, she would babysit but never admit that I was her own
Until she got to know me, she fell in love with the boy and she helped develop a man, I'm wishin' she could see me grown
She used to call me every mornin', talk about the same thing, I still haven't deleted Grandmama from my phone, goddamn
Livin' my happiest moments, I ain't signed cause these raps, I should own 'em
That makes sense cause I actually wrote them, this crap I devoted, I latched with emotions
That passion is quoted on tattoos and posts that I see in your socials, I'm trapped in the moment
How fast is the vocal, I'd snap in the moments, notice, know it's gettin' cash, you should trash the diploma
You don't wanna see me in my dark side, I left all that shit in my archives
If you comin' at the team or the fam then I swing as hard as I can like I'm on a par-five
Work hard, never part time, I treat everybody how I think that they should treat me
So treat everybody how you think they should treat you cause you never know who might still pack heat

You don't wanna see me mad, you don't wanna see me spaz
You don't wanna see me glad, you don't wanna see me laugh
You don't wanna know my past, you don't wanna know my thoughts
They don't know who I am, only pickin' out my flaws
You don't wanna see me mad, you don't wanna see me spaz
You don't wanna see me glad, you don't wanna see me laugh
You don't wanna know my past, you don't wanna know my thoughts
They don't know who I am, only pickin' out my flaws
