[Goody Grace:]
I know I'm not always around
I know sometimes I can't be found
I'm lost in a world of my own
It's out of control and everyone knows

[Futuristic:]
Texting my phone that you miss me
I'm busy I ain't even see them yet
Remember that moment you kissed me
Out of nowhere, I ain't even meet you yet
We used to kick it and we used to party
Sometimes we would lay up, not do a thing
Sometimes we fight about nothing
You tell me to leave I came right back like boomerangs
Now we can't eat without getting stopped
And now I can't sleep cause I'm on the clock
And now you can't reach me all of the time
I'm at work you think that I'm somewhere I'm not
And you've always kind of been insecure
I always did more just so you were sure
Now I can't be there to show you
So I'm copping things in the class we couldn't afford
I followed my aspirations
That lead to more obligations and less conversation
And more invitations
Were my response always is "Sorry can't make it."
I know that you hate it
With all these temptations you know that I'm faced with
But all I can say is I still feel the same
But when you see chance baby you gotta take it

[Goody Grace:]
I know I'm not always around
I know sometimes I can't be found
I'm lost in a world of my own
It's out of control and everyone knows
I can't go back now
We can't go back now
Leave that in the background
You know that we can't go back now

[Futuristic:]
Get back to you as soon as possible
In this age it's hard to be responsible
With all of these obstacles I've been through
Trying to show you that I still got time for you
Now you've been tripping when nothing's wrong
Acting like we ain't have something strong
You used to sit in the studio watch me
You probably see me do a hundred songs
I've been gone but I do that for both of us
You should be happy when these people notice us
Lining up shows for us
They do the most for us
Remember them days when we used to be broke as fuck
We should be celebrating
It seems like you jealous of what I'm making
It seems like you rather me still be at home at my mother's place
Stuck in that town with a ton of hate
Never thought that we would grow up and grow apart
Never thought my two loves would get pulled apart
Never thought I would have to choose between
The girl in my bed
And what drove me from the start
Never thought I would get to my dreams
And it wouldn't be what it seems
Cause fame overwhelming and shoot it I need
But you can't get with everything that it brings

[Goody Grace:]
I know I'm not always around
I know sometimes I can't be found
I'm lost in a world of my own
It's out of control and everyone knows
I can't go back now
We can't go back now
Leave that in the background
You know that we can't go back now

I can't go back can't go back now
I can't go back can't go back now
I can't go back can't go back now
I know I'm not always around
I know sometimes I can't be found
I'm lost in a world of my own
It's out of control and everyone knows
I can't go back now
We can't go back now
Leave that in the background
You know that we can't go back now
