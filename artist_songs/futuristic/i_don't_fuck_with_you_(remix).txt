[Pre-Hook:]
I don't fuck with you
You lil stupid ass rapper, I ain't fucking with you
You lil, you lil dumb ass rapper, I ain't fucking with you
I could murder every nigga in your whole fucking crew
Think I be starting with you

[Hook:]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Nigga, I don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
Give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 1:]
Whoa, I came in the game to deflate their egos
Coming at your neck like a tie on a tuxedo
Everything I do these rappers biting like mosquitoes
Damn, I bet he mad that his sister want the burrito
Hah, I only speak true stories, dude's corny
Sorry, but there's nothing you could do for me
I got two shorties, sipping two forties, in the booth horny
They clean and wet, like a pool that got some new chlorine
Uh, and rappers wanna be my friends now
Always writing me letters just like we pen pals
Until I do a show, and I take their ho
From em, nigga why you trippin the world know that I've been wild
I might crowd surf with my dick out
Come to the show and get in the front row if you really just don't wanna miss out
Sipping that vodka right out of the bottle I swear that it's all that I piss out
Throw on a pizza then jump on a car, getting head in the bathroom then dip out
And I don't fuck with square-rappers
Only-got-fame-cause-you-got-some-good-hair-rappers
Not really your passion, but your daddy made it happen
Now you talking 'bout your struggles, while nobody fucking cares, faggot
I been doing this shit way longer than you Sway
I feel like Kanye, I feel like Andre
I'm sipping bombay, my bottle blue
So are your balls cause none of these broads are fucking with you

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Yo, talk is cheap, yet I'm making money for talking
And saying fast words like a dude who sells at a auction
Pregnant flow in the morning it make you noxious
Opponents cross their arms, cause the know they going in coffins
Yo, no losses on my team, my homies came to play
You walk out the house, with your squad, it look like a gay parade
Bitches crying when I take the stage
I'm highly anticipated like the movie "Fifty Shades of Grey"
I came to say, I paved the way, my state is full of followers
A lot of rappers suck, and well, you're looking like a swallower
My flow is hot, like rocking thermals in the summer
Futuristic keep it shining like thermals on her stomach, gotta love it
Getting murdered by a nerd without a budget
And they talking and I bag them, like a girl with lot of luggage
This game I fucking run it and I heard you got some crutches
We eating over here, you couldn't get a McNugget, nigga
Cold blooded my style is take no prisoners
I'm getting chips and now they salty, where's the vinegar?
Fuck all my listerners, I spread the message like a minister
I'm tryna be notorious, like Christopher
I really do this shit, I think they're starting to get it
This show is 'bout to start, so you should probably get a ticket
I really do this shit, my name is Futuristic, my name is Futuristic
Said it twice in case you missed it, I don't fuck with you
