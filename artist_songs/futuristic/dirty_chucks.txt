[Intro:]
Yeah, uh, I don't normally say shit before I go on
But we've been all around the country in the dirty chucks nigga, uh Shmang, shmang, pow, pow
Tell a friend, tell a ho, tell your wife, nigga, yo, yo

[Verse 1:]
Took the nation by storm with a live performance
Cleanest nigga, can't believe the kicks this nigga perform in, yo
What's on my feet is not important, look what I've been sporting
Forty dollars for a pair, man, fuck a Jordan
Dirty chucks that made enough
To pay the mortgage at your momma's house
Dirty sluts, they wanna fuck, cause all the things I rhyme about
I slip them off in the hotel and then she finding out
The bed is kinda tall, if she small, then she gon' be climbing out
Chasing down a dream is where it started
I ran through twenty pairs, the dearly departed
Shit's retarded, I got holes in them
Man, I did about thirty shows in them
Blow hit them, rain and snow, I hit the road and flowed in them
No gimmicks, no image, I'm just a hard worker
Bars perfect, looking at my momma like it's all worth it
I've struggled and I've hustled quite enough
I got a lot of kicks, but I don't give a fuck, I'm in my dirty chucks

[Hook:]
Dirty chucks, dirty chucks, dirty chucks
I don't give a fuck, I'm in my dirty chucks
Dirty chucks, dirty chucks
I don't give a fuck, I'm in my dirty chucks

[Verse 2:]
I kissed a girl that I would eventually marry
Walked the grass at the cemetery
Where my grandma was buried
And carried my little brother to the bathroom, to throw up
Hardest reminiscing got me thinking, man, you know what
I've grown up, I showed up, I've showed out and I changed
I got tore up, I got no love, went from no bus to that van
No brand in that chain, no place and no name
No support, no co-signs, my own time with no lame
And it seems stereotypical, you couldn't walk a mile in them
Looking in her eyes, in her deathbed, make her smile with them
Then hit the stage the next day and fucking wild in them
Took care of my fam, hit the grocery store, every aisle in them
I still style in them, now I got the leather pair
Accompanied by some expensive shit, your ass will never wear
Shaking hands with fans and ignoring fam that was never there
I take them off and throw them in the crowd
You better get prepared

[Hook]
