[Intro:]
Ha, yeah, alright, you know who it is, we gon' take y'all back
Future and J-Merk, let's get it, yeah, uh, alright

[Verse 1:]
Been in the game for a minute, still niggas wanna disrespect it
I'm like Wi-Fi, cause I'm well connected
If you a student of the flow then you felt the lesson
Welcome to the class, it's like that, I'm the professor
Suit and a tie with the coolest of rides
Sip a little bit of syrup, now I'm leaning to the side
Got an escort service, cause I don't even drive
White people love the music, they giving me high-fives
I'm fly, I swear I hit the mall every week
More shoes than Jordan, more chains than Mr. T
With the music I won't quit, cause I know it's meant to be
And I ain't got time for class, cause I'm making history
One-o-two, nigga, get a blues clues, nigga
My lyrics is in your ear, like a bluetooth, nigga
Screw you niggas if you think that you cold
I'm the best unsigned, yeah, you already know

[Sample]

[Verse 2:]
Okay, I do me, these niggas ain't 'bout that
Everytime I rap, I snap, like a mouse trap
If I fall then I trampoline bounce back
I'm at the crib getting pusssy, house cat
And then I'm out that, let me get dressed
Put on something fresh then I'm on to the next
Yeah, my flow cold, got winter fresh breath
And my chain iced out so I got a stiff neck
Get checks, bitch, I get paper
And the stack real high like a skyscraper
I'm sticking to money like flypaper
When you see me in the streets, I be like, "Hi, hater!
Goodbye, later", I got shit to do
I got women lined up, I'm a pick a few
Got groupies on deck, you could get some too
And I'm feeling like a drill if she fit to screw
