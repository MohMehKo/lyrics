[Verse 1:]
Fresh cut, with my snapback, CD's in my backpack
I'm the shit, with no exlax, I work out, no guest pass
Tank on with my tats out, cargos with my ass out
Rubberband with my cash out, she see me and she pass out
You can't blame her, because I'm the man, obviously
This ain't Twitter but it seems everybody
And their momma always wanna come follow me
How do he come hard on every track
He a monster and this ain't Holloween
Got money like I just won the lottery
Give a fuck about a nigga in poverty
Who hot as me, let me think, um, nobody
They all wanna rap now, get a new hobby
Shitty flows, pissy ho's, they so potty
Hood niggas, six felonies, four shotties
Oh gholee, let me tell you, I don't give a fuck bitch
Bumping my own shit, while I get my nuts licked
I hope you niggas understanding me, you fans of me
I randomly spit angrily, now can't nobody handle me

[Hook:]
Y'all can't handle me, nigga, no, y'all can't handle me
Y'all can't handle me, hater, no, y'all can't handle me
Y'all can't handle me, baby, no, y'all can't handle me
Y'all can't handle me, bitch, y'all can't handle me
Let me be frank, y'all niggas suck
Please quit rapping, shut the fuck up
Let me be frank, y'all niggas suck
Please quit rapping, shut the fuck up

[Verse 2:]
Hoes come by the buttload, alcohol, truckloads
Clothes off at the front door, already with blunts rolled
Packed up, suitcase, girl tripping, shoelace
New one every Tuesday, they see me, they like hooray
I do my own stunting, Jackie Chan, I'm about to blow up Pakistan
And my chicks stay naked, like Africans
And now their dudes looking blue, like a magic fan
I do my thing and it ain't that hard to see
Quit jocking my style, lil nigga fall back
I'm the Future, it ain't that hard to be
Aktion making the hardest beats
My green do the talking, harvesting
I'm a martian outta this world with the flow
So that money ain't enough to offer me
Quit talking please, need a coffin please
I'm a off these niggas, no charges please
I'm a baller just like barkly, so none of y'all lames is guarding me
I'm slaughtering opponents and I ain't even trying
Rest in peace to competition, need a moment of silence

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Plaid shirt, G-Shock, colorful like a peacock
White girls say he's hot, that means me so he's not
No swag, more sauce, don't know yet, get lost
Make them jump, Kris Kross, I'm too fresh and they're pissed off
What you mad for? Cause everybody know my name
Your girl wanna rock my chain, everybody know you lame
Damn nigga, I'm so ill, do my thing, deal, no deal
She know I'm cold now she wanna chill
And I go hard, I don't need no pill
I'm sick don't need no pill, funny ass nigga, Cosby Bill
Rich ass family, Jada, Will, I'm just trynna make a bill
I'm just trynna get a deal, bitch I'm a get it soon
And my flow is extra hot, just like August, July and June
Okay, I'm clowning on these lame O's
My closet is a fitting room, I walk in there and change clothes
I gotta go, when it comes to this rap shit, I'm the favorite
Niggas be hating, given me crooked
Looks like teeth that need some braces

[Hook]
