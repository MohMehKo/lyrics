[Intro:]
Yo, I just, I just heard a nigga bumping that old shit, yo, yo

[Verse 1:]
Who the fuck you think you're talking to? It's Futuristic, bitch
These rappers nowadays is all sweeter than Pixy Sticks
They too concerned about a Insta pic and getting rich
I built it with my people, my people is who I'm sticking with
The same nigga that's been spitting the truth
Chasing down a dream, I been the living proof
I been with kids that shoot, that will make you switch your mood
I been the kid that was fighting and been kicked outta school
That's the old me, everybody acting like they know me now
And it's a function whenever that boy come [?]
I hold it down, a lil nigga with the coldest style
Pouring shots to thots at the party who got a open mouth
I can't remember the days when I didn't drink
Sometimes I'm getting faded just so I don't gotta think
They love me for everythink that I teach
My lyrics that hit them deep
Then bring a fiend to they knees, that's my old shit

[Hook 1:]
I ain't never gonna change, but that other shit is lame
Man, you bumping all my old shit
I mean it's kinda cool, but I got something to prove
Motherfucker, that's my old shit
I really do this, wait until you hear all of my new hits
You tripping of my old shit?
Motherfucker you don't know shit, that's my old shit

[Verse 2:]
Yo, this last year was hella crazy, right?
I'm suprised I ain't got a baby
From all of these ladies I came and laid the pipe
They begging for it, never stayed the night, a crazy life
A plane I catch, it's on to the next and I see my name and lights
It go, F-U-T, you know the rest
Team on my back, like a shoulder press
I was so depressed, progression was looking spectic
When my new shit finally hit them
I know that they gon' be so impressed
My grandma passed and I lost my spirit
I lost my love and in my voice, yeah, you can hear it
A dream I been pursuing, I'm finally getting near it
That hurdle's a little taller, I know that I'm 'bout to clear it
Got them cheering even if they ain't know me before I hit the stage
Then I come back, they got my lyrics, like they ripped the page
I'm gifted, like it's christmas day
My new shit is about to be the only shit you play
Man, that's my old shit

[Hook 2:]
I ain't never gonna change, but that other shit is lame
Man, you bumping all my old shit
I mean it's kinda cool, but I got something to prove
Motherfucker, that's my old shit
I really do this, wait until you hear all of my new hits
You tripping of my old shit?
I got some cold shit, I got some more shit
Man, you bumping all that old shit

[Outro:]
I got some new shit, I really do this, man, you listen to my old shit
Yo, I got some cold shit, a whole lotta more shit
Damn, bro, you bumping all that old shit, uh
I got some new shit, in my closet, you know I built the booth quick
You listen to that old shit, that's some cold shit
But this is all my new shit, nigga, it's fucking fire, bitch
