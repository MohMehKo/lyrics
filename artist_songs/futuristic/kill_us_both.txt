[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
Should I stay? Or should I go?
Should I leave? I just don't know
I might be broke, but you love me
I need that time, you need your space
I need that school, I need LA
I miss your face, baby, touch me
Would you be mad, if you heard
I was out, with other girls
Your vision's blurred, girl, it's nothing
But I'd be mad, if you'd moved on
Cause you still mine even when I'm gone
Is love so strong? We got something
And that's a thing I don't wanna lose
We choose to pursuit what's new
You and me, we got science
Chemistry more than finding the elephant in the room, it's huge
I always knew that this would end bad
Pin pad in a sick lab or a pet lab with a kid
Picket fence got me feeling boxed in
Too young to settle down with a friend
We could pretend behind smiles movie days and late dinners
Bed made, eyes wide open as you laying
And you face is placed in the same position on my chest it's '09
Veg remembers
I can see you upset, if I stay and listen
You can see that I'm a mess if you pay attention
We tryna work on it but don't make a difference
I hate the distance and you really hate the buisness, fuck
You gotta understand I'm a brother with another plan
If you giving feel, in my dreams and everyone of my knees
Let me score or find another man
No don't, please don't, don't go, oh no, please don't

[Hook - Futuristic:]
Cause that's gon' kill us both
That's gon' kill us both
That's gon' kill us both
That's gon' kill us both
I know
That's gon' kill us both
That's gon' kill us both
That's gon' kill us both
I know

[Verse 2 - Kara Revesz:]
The day we met, our eyes locked in
We talked all night, just like old friends
I knew right then, that I loved you
I clinched my fist, I hold on tight
This can't be wrong, it feel so right
I can't let go, I love you
I wouldn't ask, for you to stay
Throw all of your dreams away
To see my face, but I'm selfish
But I'd be sad, if you pursuit
And I had no connect with you
Regret it too, I just can't help it
