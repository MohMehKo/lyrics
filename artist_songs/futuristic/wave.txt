Always there to talk
Every time you call
Always there to catch you
Every time you fall
Let you be right sometimes
Even when you're wrong
Let you change the station
Even when they play my favorite song
Take you out for sushi
Ion't even like it
Say you wanna smoke, so I hit the plug
Roll up then I light it
If we fightin' and I let you win
I was closed but I let you in
Do it on the sofa, then we rollin' over
Do it all again

'Cause you're like a wave
You keep comin' in
Leave a salty taste
All over my skin
You're like a wave
You crash at my feet
Then you disappear
But the view is unique

(And I caught the wave)
I jus' be ridin' the wave, I jus' be ridin' the wave
(I'm on the wave)
I jus' be ridin' the wave, I jus' be ridin' the wave
(Yeah, I caught the wave)
I jus' be ridin' the wave, I jus' be ridin' the wave
(I'm on the wave)
I jus' be ridin' the wave, I jus' be ridin' the wave

Ion't know how we got here
All I know is Ion't like it when you not here, y'know
And I seen you roll by twice
It was weird, you ain't stop here, hm
And I know you got a lot to fear 'cause of your past
Everybody been there, say they different than your last (than your last)
Ion't only tryna hit it from the back
But I get it, it's kinda hard to give a rapper a Chance
I mean, think about it, use your Logic, it's Eazy (Eazy)
Take a Kodak, we be laughin' like Weezy (laughing)
You should never, wonder 'cause I ain't Stevie (no)
I'll never walk on you like a Yeezy (no)
You say it ain't safe to love me
I say don't fight the vibe (don't fight the vibe)
You say that you on a Quest, though
I just wanna be on the Tribe
And I've had every type of girl (every type of girl)
I done been through 'em all (been through 'em all)
You the only one I need, though
You the baddest thing, that's all (goddamn)
I be goin' in it raw
Talkin' 'bout sex on the beach (okay)
You be watchin' SpongeBob
And I'm tryna give you Sandy Cheeks, ya dig?

'Cause you're like a wave
You keep comin' in
Leave a salty taste
All over my skin
You're like a wave (you're like a wave)
You crash at my feet (crash at my feet)
Then you disappear
But the view is unique

(And I caught the wave)
I jus' be ridin' the wave, I jus' be ridin' the wave
(I'm on the wave)
I jus' be ridin' the wave, I jus' be ridin' the wave
(Yeah, I caught the wave)
I jus' be ridin' the wave, I jus' be ridin' the wave
(I'm on the wave)
I jus' be ridin' the wave, I jus' be ridin' the wave
(Surfin', surfin')

You back and you forward
You come and you go
You leave and I stay (leave and I stay)
You take me up high
Then bring me down low
Then wash me away (wash me away)
You nip at my toes
You hot and you cold
You leave me at bay (you leave me at bay)
You back and you forward
You come and you go
You leave and I stay

You're like a wave
You keep comin' in
Leave a salty taste
All over my skin
You're like a wave
You crash at my feet
Then you disappear
But the view is unique

(And I caught the wave)
I jus' be ridin' the wave, I jus' be ridin' the wave
(I'm on the wave)
I jus' be ridin' the wave, I jus' be ridin' the wave
(Yeah, I caught the wave)
I jus' be ridin' the wave, I jus' be ridin' the wave
(I'm on the wave)
I jus' be ridin' the wave, I jus' be ridin' the wave
