[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
I don't really care what they say about me
I'm sleep when I'm dead and gone
I'm chasing down a dream
A dream, a dream
I'm chasing down a dream
I'm chasing down a dream

[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
I been rapping since I was talking, running since I was walking
Grabbing the microphone from the stand like my daddy taught me
Watching the VMAs with my brothers jealous of Justin determined
To change my nothing into a whole lot of something
The hard work pays off, my days long
Had to find a way to make the bass strong
I make great songs, no Kreayshawn
Impatient I ain't tryna wait long but
I Take time to perfect it they offered me deals but I reject it
They want my soul, creative control
And 60% of everything that I'm repping nah
I got these billion dollar dreams that I've been chasing
Studio in the basement
Producing shit that's amazing
They ain't help me, call me selfish
All they wanna do it take it
It's for my love of the game
It ain't about just being famous
I'm a get there or die trying
I'm a product of my environment
Music's in my blood
It's on my mind when I close my eyelids
Wake up then it's back to grinding
No 9-5 but I tried it
I just wanna be the voice you hear every time that you're riding, so

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Futuristic:]
My Lil' brother 'bout to be 16, new whip I got you
My older bro be promoting shows
Take him on the road, give him a job too
My other brothers both talented
That's a platform to get their own shine
My lil' sister fall in love quick
With these dumb kids and their young minds
I wanna take 'em all on a vacay
Make sure they ain't broke for a week 'til payday
I got a girl back home
Damn I wish she'd ignore the things that they say
My cousin's all straight
I want to take my best friend out the hood
Make him give away his AK
My momma ain't one for the drama
I'm a make sure she ain't gotta payment a day late
My dad'll be my DJ
Every beat Akt. make will be on replay
My cousin is a reckless driver
I'm a get him a dope whip to tear up the freeway
And WTF be the clique
I'm a get a big bus so we can mob together
Give 'em a job whatever
It ain't a prob whenever
See all my songs be better
We going hard forever
And, as for me
I just want to say I made it
Bring all my real people so I'm not around no fake shit
Put me on the A-List
Music on that replay list
Filling the faces of anyone who doubted me or hated so
