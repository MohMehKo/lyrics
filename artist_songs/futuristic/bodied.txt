[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
Burn slow, if you hate you get flamed out
Everybody in the states know my name now
200k just chilling in the PayPal
I'm 'bout to blow, get away not a safe crown
All you niggas steady rapping with the same sound
Fucking with the same bitches, kissing all the same mouths
I been doing this since the playground, just did a show in Detroit where they filmed the movie 8 mile
I'm bout to lose myself, I do myself, the truth is felt, and you can tell
Shit if I was you I would shoot myself, nah if I was a scout I'd recruit myself
Made an album, no budget, and recruit myself
Y'all niggas can't even tie your shoes yourself
Got a song worldwide on the radio, all independent, you signed, then you got shelved DAMN!
But I still gotta prove myself, no I'm the greatest where the belt at
50 million plays on Facebook I know they felt that
Haters fell back, cause they know that I melt tracks
I'm the shit smell that, rolling in the deep, where's Adele at squad up
WTF gang pulling up in firetrucks, don't get me fired up
I made a living off this music and you niggas ain't even made five bucks
OK I'm tired of debating, let me in the conversation, I been runnin' Arizona boy
And I been trying not to say it, cause you don't deserve attention but lately I'm getting so annoyed
The comments is hard to avoid, and anybody that want it can come and get destroyed
But funny thing is I'm living out in L.A, went back home just for a week, to see my other bitch in Illinois
I can take a break for a year come back and I know that it won't change
I'm a still be known 'round the globe, and you still gon' be a no name
You made a song you was hoping that it might work, next time you open up for me I hope your mic work
Your album hit the charts one day, it was gone day two that's what we call light work
Game over, I don't think the lights work
Y'all niggas getting washed, like my shirt
Shitting on 'em my diet heavy in fiber
And don't nobody wanna see me in a cypher
I swear to God if you give me a day to write first
But mic burst, you might get hurt from the backlash
When my song come on, in the car they start yelling from the backseat like they on Cash Cab
Bombs over Baghdad, y'all niggas getting dropped like a baby getting held by a bad dad,
Every time I diss clowns, don't nobody know who the diss 'bout honestly that's sad
Back to back that's two in the row, superdest flow, coolest dude that you ever know
I guess I'll smoke, that was like two years ago, so I'm a do it to 'em real quick homie burn slow, let 'em know

[Hook - Futuristic & Devvon Terrell:]
I can do this with my eyes closed, dressed in all black like the five-o, and I'm aiming at my rivals
I be shooting like a rifle, and I just did the Tonight Show, we like winning sold out my show, when eating everybody wanna get a bite tho
Everything getting bodied, everything getting bodied, I can body anything
Everything getting bodied, everything getting bodied, send me a beat you know I got it
Everything getting bodied, everything getting bodied, I can body anything
Everything getting bodied, everything getting bodied, send me a beat you know I got it, got it

[Verse 2 - Devvon Terrell:]
Somebody give me the crown, I think I got the juice and you just looking thirsty right now
I'm feeling like I'm way up and you way down, I feel like when I'm awake, you still on lay down
This is the game now, I am here all by myself, I am not looking for help
Throwing my hands up like welp, you train in water and I'm feeling like Michael Phelps
Feeling like a nigga Steph Curry with the shot boy, if you hot boy, I'm knowing you can come now
Only bad news when I come down, I'm up now, you been doing like way too much
You don't know my situation, standing in line like forever I really been waiting
Workin' and workin' been slaving, Devvon Terrell and Futuristic we made it

[Hook - Futuristic & Devvon Terrell:]
Everything getting bodied, everything getting bodied, I can body anything
Everything getting bodied, everything getting bodied, send me a beat you know I got it
Everything getting bodied, everything getting bodied, I can body anything
Everything getting bodied, everything getting bodied, send me a beat you know I got it, got it
