[Verse 1:]
They want me to sell my soul, no way, no way
They ask how I'm living though, I said, "I'm a-okay"
Gimme something I can rap to, with a 808
I'm like a kid who ain't got no hands, I don't play no games
No way, no way, no way, no way
Y'all niggas all sound the same, look alike
I swear to God, I hate your face
I got the juice, José, José
This my life, y'all treat the shit like a hobby
Like a old bitch doing crochet
A lot of fish in the sea, they ain't found me, I'm feeling like Nemo
When I'm drunk, I'm Arizona's jackass, got me feeling like Steve-O
My Twitter verified and my Facebook too
Now tell me where's my VEVO?
I'm recording and they watching me, through the TV, that's TiVo
Tim Tebow, take a knee, you can't compete
Your bitch finna take the D, make the team
I produced like I made the beat
Y'all got a whole new race, boy, you fakanese
Ain't nothing fake in me, you might as well have implants
Your songs on the playlist everybody skip like gym class, oh God

[Hook x2:]
No way, no way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way, no way

[Verse 2:]
Do I take days off? No way, no way
Miss me with that bullshit, olé, olé
Flow so hot I might burn ya, no shade, no shade
No stylist, I look clean, by my God damn self, no may, no may
I'm telling you, I got it, anybody digging different, gonna get it
Futuristic be that nigga, killing every single city
Grabbing titties, even if they itty-bitty, leaving niggas shitty
Drinking, think I need another kidney, if you with me, say, hell yeah
Say, okay, I'm out here, is you no way?
Okay, niggas get in it like lo mein
You know that I'm spitting that propane
I been a cold nigga, since fourth grade
Four niggas talking, dig four graves
I'm tryna be twice as big as Tity Boi, I need 4 Chainz
Taking you niggas to school
I swear, I'm a freshman, like I'm fourteen
She want me to go down on her, no way, no way
I'm getting head on the tour bus
She on her knees, but she don't pray
They say I'm a dog, so you know I'm gon' stray
With the white girl saying dope lines, I dropped cocaine, do you?

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3:]
No way, no fucking way, no way, no way
They ask how I'm living though, I said, "I'm a-okay"
But I'm not okay
No way, no way, no way, no way
I moved to LA, everything gon' be great
She don't want me to stay, but I'm doing my thing
How much more can I take? So much shit on my plate
And you in my way, my way, yo, we should talk about this
I don't talk about shit, I just rap about it
When a song comes on, they all ask about it
I tell them it's a story, it ain't really 'bout me, I made it up
Influenced by love, influenced by drugs, influenced by drink
Things can never ever go back to how they was
The show great, but it ends there, I got fans, no friends there
A bunch of boys think they running the game, but we been here
The dynamic with my family's always been weird
I don't like to be home, I'm liking the road, fuck, I'm rambling now
This money I'm making, I wish I could save it
But wanna be famous, I'm handing it out, do you want some?
No fucking way
I worked hard for this shit and my thoughts would have quit
But I can't, no way

[Hook]
