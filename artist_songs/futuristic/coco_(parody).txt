[Intro:]
Clean up an aisle three, I repeat, clean up an aisle three
This nigga done came in here and ate all the mothrfucking cocoa puffs in this bitch, oh God

[Hook - Futuristic:]
I'm in love with the cocoa
I'm in love with the cocoa
I got it for the low, low
I'm in love with the cocoa

I'm in love with the cocoa
I'm in love with the cocoa
Oh my God, this beat is so slow
I'm in love with the cocoa

[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
I'm in love with the cocoa
Butter, ashy elbows is a no, no
Chocolate chips up in my dodo
Brownie bites up in my fro, yo
Imported from Tokyo, Cocoa Puffs in like every single photo
Got it for the low, low, I would take candy from a hobo
Chocolate syrup really got a nigga moving slow mo
Hop out the four door, with some pro hoes
Looking cuter that a snow globe, got a pack of Rolo's
I cop so much cocoa, when I carry it inside a [?] I look like quasimodo
Like Ice-T, I'm in love with the Coco (that's a white bitch)
She throw it at me just like Tony Romo
What that nigga say? Pause, no homo, I'm not gay
I got choclate milk up in my solo

[Pre-Hook - Futuristic:]
Chocolate syrup, I got chocolate syrup
Chocolate syrup, I got chocolate syrup
Whip it, whip it fast, nigga
Touch my Cocoa Puffs and I'm a beat your ass, nigga

[Hook - Futuristic]

[Verse 2 - Jakob Owens:]
I be rapping on my tippy toes
Choclate milk to dip my Oreo's
And I could've shot the video
Then I heard the song and said it was too shitty though
Cocoa powder mixed with protein powder
Hit the gym, for like, thirty hours
My bath is made of chocolate
I got Yoo-Hoo running out my faucet
I keep that stash up in my closet
All these M&M's keep falling out my pockets
All my raps about chocolate, they going stupid hard
What that mean, every line is a candy bar

[Pre-Hook - Jakob Owens:]
Chocolate syrup, I got chocolate syrup
Chocolate syrup, I got chocolate syrup
Whip it, whip it fast, cracker
Touch my Cocoa Puffs, I'm a beat your ass, cracker
