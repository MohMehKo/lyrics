What's up y'all
It's your boy, Futuristic
I wrote a verse today
I'm a rap it for you
It's fucking lit

Black & white like a panda
Need a girl with a booty from Atlanta
Grab a camera everybody at my shows act like the cops got a gun pointed at em hands up
I feel like drake did on ransom
Young rich & handsome hotline bling dancin takin these chances remix these songs from rappers funny thing is you can't understand em
I got bars like the slammer I can cook like a grandma
Every song is the anthem they yellin hot shit like country grammar
Futuristic been killin I'm from the desert I don't like chillin made half million all from my building treat these women jus like a dentist no fillings

They don't really wanna get into everytime I do it its fluent it's movin look at the views I get
I leave you ruined u foolish u stupid look at the coolest kid
How I maneuver through it I'm coolin look at the dude he spit like call of duty uzi pointed at you like in a movie script
I'm wearin black in a hat in the cab like I'm a Jewish kid
Yo girl is in my lap with a ass lookin like nudist is better not turn your back when I rap do you like Brutus did
Got em sayin yea jus like usher I ain't never scared like bone crusher got a big head like a gusher like metro boomin I don't trust ya
