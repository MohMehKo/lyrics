[Intro - Futuristic:]
Yeah, yeah, so far away

[Hook - Futuristic:]
What the fuck am I gon' do now
I shoulda got my college degree
It seem like everybody moving on
But nobody saved the seat for me
I'm scrolling through my phone
Texting bitches that I know
But I just can't seem to get a reply
I'm staring in the mirror
I see the fear of failure in my eyes
I don't know what else I can try

[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
I'm drowning in a sea, my emotions
Destiny ain't in your hands
I did the most, but can't control it
Soul is broken, feeling hopeless
But no moping, still been going
Don't smoke, but lately I'm smoking
Fourth quarter, feel like I'm choking
I spit my dough, I'm the brokest
Still feel my flow, it's the coldest
My story, I just retold it
Over and over and over
But I'm so close and I'm so far
And I'm so dope, that's what I thought
I'm working hard, I'm working smart
But I'm still stuck in the same spot
Somebody help me, somebody help me, somebody help me
I try to get wealthy, just wanna pay my bills
Uh, somebody help me, somebody help me, somebody help me
Or I'm 'bout to end this shit for real, so

[Hook - Futuristic:]
What the fuck am I gon' do now
I shoulda got my college degree
It seem like everybody moving on
But nobody saved the seat for me
I'm scrolling through my phone
Texting bitches that I know
But I just can't seem to get a reply
I'm staring in the mirror
I see the fear of failure in my eyes
I don't know what else I can try

[Verse 2 - Futuristic:]
Looking at pictures from all my friends graduations
Smiles on their families faces, nothing but happy occasions
Marriages, having babies, I ain't close to that at all
My relationship with this music, made my others fall apart
And I can't talk about this shit for nothing
Nobody comprehends it, they see the ending
But don't get I had to start to finish
You wanna do it, too? The truth is, I don't recommend it
Politics and money's what matters, fuck if you extra gifted
Best of wishes to the women that I've loved and lost
Drifting through these conversations
Sifting through my other thoughts
Awkward tension, cause we both know that it's over
Emotional Rollercoaster, starting to become my favorite song, so

[Hook - Futuristic:]
What the fuck am I gon' do now
I shoulda got my college degree
It seem like everybody moving on
But nobody saved the seat for me
I'm scrolling through my phone
Texting bitches that I know
But I just can't seem to get a reply
I'm staring in the mirror
I see the fear of failure in my eyes
I don't know what else I can try

[Outro - Futuristic:]
What the fuck am I gon' do now
I shoulda got my college degree
It seem like everybody moving on
But nobody saved the seat for me
I'm scrolling through my phone
Texting bitches that I know
But I just can't seem to get a reply
