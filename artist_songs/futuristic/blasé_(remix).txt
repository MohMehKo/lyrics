[Verse 1 - Devvon Terrell:]
I feel like no place is safe
I'm comin' up and you still tryna hate
I'm eatin' good and they all want my plate
Call Jenny Craig cause I feel overweight
And I am so gargantuan
My, my, my, I am the realest
I'm steppin' in every spot like I'm Godzilla
My gosh, it's a lotta ya
Y'all just keep poppin' up from the US or the China
They run it like "Hayaku!"
Everything you got, it's time for the takin'
If this is your spot then prepare for invasion
Tell me who [?] homie
You should just give it up, bruh, like your first name was Kobe
You niggas [?] you remind me of bubble gum
I'm on your ass when I run it like Forrest Gump
Got you confused and you askin' him where he from
Hittin' you in your head, P2K, boom, boom, boom
Futuristic, oh yeah, that's my amigo
Left right up down oh they think we got cheat codes
Weirdo and WTF, we eat up
Mister Miyagi, you know I'm the teacher
King of the castle I think that I'm Caeser
Every beat we on they bang like a speaker
Givin' you warnin' I'm beggin' you see it
I'm backin' up, all you hearin' is beepin'
Beepin', beepin'

[Verse 2 - Futuristic:]
Sheesh
Hi guys! I'm back with the ill shit
Three tours in a year, big field trips
Hunter in the booth cause I kill shit
Your girl will switch, Will Smith, real shit
She can get picked like a flower
Lookin' like the man of the hour
Fresh, I hopped out the shower
Like, anybody wanna get it they can get it
Futuristic's spittin' fire like Bowser, wowzers
Who do you know that's been grindin' like I do?
I mean, I was rappin' like way before high school
Back when you was puttin' Kool Aid in a blue tray
Tryna make a watermelon ice cube, remember?
Now I got a crib and the rooms all spacious
Now I got a a whip and it sound like a spaceship
Used to drop bars in my dad's old basement
Now I'm your favorite rapper's replacement
Anxious for what's up next
Lotta big shows, a lotta rough sex
Lotta plaques to hang, a lotta cash to make
I need a office space that got a front desk
And I'm flexin' like Brock Lesnar
You rap too but you not better
My flows make 'em uncomfortable
Like wearin' a sweater in hot weather, Goddamn
Ohh, blasé, blasé, blasé
