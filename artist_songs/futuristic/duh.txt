[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
No car but your boy still rolling
No remote so these hoes can't control him
Tank on so the tats always showing
Low so you know I'm 'bout to go in
Flexing when you see us, now you wanna be us
Bitch, I am a man, you looking like a fetus
And I'm getting brain from a lady that's a genius
Forgive me for my sins and tell me I need Jesus
If you scared go to church
If you don't care, grab your head, go to work
No shirt, lil skirt when she twerk
Futuristic sold out, ah, you a jerk
I don't give no fuck, y'all get ate, cold cuts
Everywhere I go I see some fans already know us
They acting like they don't 'til my video get poured up
"You the guy with D-WHY on No Budget? Oh, duh!"

[Hook - Futuristic:]
I'm the shit, duh, you a bitch, duh
Everybody all up on my dick, duh
All I do is sit and make hits, duh
WTF be the clique, duh
Duh...

[Verse 2 - Miny:]
Oh, shit, it's Miny, bitches scram and scadaddle
They saying I'm a menace, yeah, I'm reckless, I'm a vandal
The lines around the corner, please, try not to get trampled
I make it rain so much it's like I'm living in Seattle
Like, duh, bitches, duh, bitches, what did you expect?
Everywhere I go has turned in, please, don't break your neck
I'm staring in the mirror, all the trends I set, reflect
No talk to talk in person so I break up with the text, damn
WTF, I say that shit so much it's like I think I have tourettes
Sauce like Futuristic, you can hold the vinegar
Your fans must show you love but they all showing us respect
Yeah, the name is Miny, I'm the new neighbor
Take your house first, make your man explain later
Rock, paper, scissors, bitch, nothing beats paper
So I get more brain than your man Don Draper

[Hook - Futuristic]

[Verse 3 - Futuristic:]
Yeah, you are what you eat, dickhead
Me? I been fresh, I been chewing big reds
I'm on the move like a nigga got six legs
Everybody wanna ride with me, big pegs
Big head, a lil nigga with a ego
Jackass, Steve-O, stunt Evil Knievel
Your chick came over, I scoped her through the peephole
I gave her the wood like I work at Home Depot
You're a zero, Futuristic is a hero kid
Arizona ice tea, my bitch sipping Neuro Bliss
Foreign chick and I came all on her euro tits
When it comes to atraction you getting eight like a euro bitch
You're a bitch, say something
You the best rapper out, huh? Play something
They hear your shit and they be like, huh?
And then they hear my shit and they be like, duh!
