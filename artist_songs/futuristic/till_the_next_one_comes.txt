[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
Breaking up is like waking up
New start to the day, here I come
I don't have to run from it anymore
Now I'm doing everything I want
I'm just tryna have fun
Lost all love cause with negative contact
But think about it really we progress, who got next?
I was only in your life for a minute
But the purpose wan never to be a hot mess
Yo, we crash and we burn, we live and we learn
You had your turn and I think it was through
Dreams that I'm chasing, I'm needing the spaceship
My feet on the pavement with you
No lies, all true
I still care about your soul
But I gotta let it go
Because I only control
All the things I really know, you stressing 'bout what I don't
We fighting 'bout what I do, I wish that shit was a joke

[Verse 2/Hook - Dylan n' Krems:]
Everything I say 'bout you
Wouldn't ever been without you
Everything I say 'bout you
I said
I don't have to cry without you
No tearing in my eyes without you
No, I don't have to lie about you
I said
But I said you can't get your self gone
I said you can't get your self gone
I said you can't get your self gone
I think I will wait 'til the next one comes
I think I will wait, I think I will wait, I think I will wait
Wait, wait, wait 'til the next one comes
Next one comes, I think I will wait 'til the next one comes
I don't have to cry without you
No tearing in my eyes without you
No, I don't have to lie about you
I know
And just because I won't forget you
Doesn't mean I won't forget to
But just because I won't forget you
I know

[Verse 3 - Futuristic:]
Life goes on, like you used to about your world
I would get bored and be on my phone
And you would tell me I was a jerk
You would tell me I don't deserve
To be with you, you was so hurt
You would tell me I was the worst
You were always [?] in your purse, here we go (here we go, here we go)
I ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta cry, everything's good
(Here we go, here we go)
You ain't gotta yell, I ain't gotta fight, everything's good
(Here we go, here we go)
Hit me on my line, leave a voicemail, everything's good
(Here we go, here we go)
You can hold his hand and pretend that everything's good

[Outro - Dylan n' Krems & Futuristic:]
I said you can't get your self gone
I said you can't get your self gone
I said you can't get your self gone
I think I will wait 'til the next one comes, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Til the next one comes, what, what, 'til the next one comes
'Til the next one comes
I think I will wait, yup, I think I will wait, yup
I think I will wait 'til the next one comes
