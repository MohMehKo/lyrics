[Karmin:]
I walked a lonely road before
With no one to call, nobody in my sight
Now everyone is on that same road
Searchin' for me, tryin' to stay alive

[Futuristic:]
Now they stress, lemme stretch, I'm about to flex
Now they stress, lemme stretch, I'm about to flex
Now they stress, lemme stretch, I'm about to flex
I'm flexin on 'em, I'm flexin on 'em, I'm flexin on 'em, I'm flexin on 'em

Lights on, shinin' on 'em, no off switch
If you hated on me, I hope that you step in dog shit
My flow is tight and your girl is loose like Rick Ross' skin
You can have her back, I'm flexin' on 'em, CrossFit
Bitch, I'm me, I'm a millionaire by twenty-five
Someone call up Jeff, we 'bout to vote these niggas out the tribe
Someone pass me the baton, I run the game, I caught my stride
Sorry pal, you are the weakest link, goodbye
Back on my shit now, please don't turn my shit down, I been so hype that I don't ever sit down
My phone blowin' up as soon as I get in town, that's twenty calls that I missed now
Women that I meet, they all on my dick now, probably cause they know that I'm gettin' rich now
I hit it, don't kiss it, I get it then get out, flex

Gettin' paper from words I write on my iPhone
Long flight, might land in a different time zone
They talk about me, got tough skin like a rhino
I hit the stance and I hit the man with that Tae Bo
Whoa, it's me, tryna get up on my team, bruh
Tryna be up in my family, that's Venus and Serena
And these girls put on their sneakers cause they been dyin' to meet us
If they bust it then I'm runnin', runnin' faster than a cheetah
No Flex Zone like Rae Sremmurd, on the radio, check the antenna
I been had bars like San Quentin, it's me, Kode Break and Quintin
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna find me, sales so good, all these labels wanna sign me
I'll get back to you on that, right now I'm fuckin' flexin'
