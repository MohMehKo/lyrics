[Bridge 1 - Devvon Terrell:]
Been a long day, baby try one of these
This the type of shit that your mother and father will never see
It's just us, we don't need them
I just wanna see you in a way you never been
Show me something new, do something you ain't never do
You can be the leading lady, I can be the muse
Talk to me nice no sassy
You can be the Damsel in distress, I'm the assassin

[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
Won't you be... my star
Baby won't you be... my star
Baby won't you be... my star
Baby won't you be... my star
Be my co-star

[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
Yeah, lights, camera, action, the way that you acting
Is got me attacking, that's fatal attraction
Career never stacked, my flow is the coldest
So I'm like fridge you stick to me like magnet
Your ass in them pants, it don't even make sense
Bet you had to lay down on the matress to zip
I can tell from your body you stay in the gym
But you shouldn't do squats in them jeans they might rip
Let me quit baby you can be my co-star, know that that's a dope part, ride me like a gold cart
You ambitious, I get it you going so far
So far you got me up in there going so hard
Cold hearted, disregarded your feelings, in the bed having sex with your mirror on the ceiling
I be acting like 'I don't wanna take it there', and then we take it there, you know you can't write the willing
You plus me make a quick fix, scratching on my back with your French tips, she don't need a jet [?]
They don't wanna miss this, we can play video games I hope you ready for the hit stick
You welcome, that's a blessing, I ain't fronting I'm possesive, I'm a teacher you need lessons, you can get a private session
They can watch it with discretion, you the one to be obsessed with, I'm the answer, here's the question

[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
Won't you be... my star
Baby won't you be... my star
Baby won't you be... my star
Baby won't you be... my star
Be my co-star

[Verse 2 - Devvon Terrell:]
Hoping you noticed that this road goes both ways
What if I told you it's faster to go my way
Leave you in the sun walkin' round, no shades
Tell me why a nigga leave you stranded; road wage
No excuses, I know how true you is
Other niggas take you for granted, why do it
You a star and I know they don't see that, watch out they come out when a young nigga [?]
Nobody believe us, hating when they see us, Niggas playin' 'round with your heart and we pressin' eject
Never let a man tell you everything that he want from you
You should be catered to cause you ain't nobody momma
You can be Michelle baby, I can be Obama
I can be the man, and my girl little stronger
You can play the part baby stay a little longer
Nah, forreal tho, stay a little longer

[Bridge 2 - Devvon Terrell:]
Baby can you tell me what you runnin' away from
Crazy how they noticed that you runnin' when I come
They can't have you now, no
Show me something new, do something you ain't never do
You can be the leading lady, I can be the muse
Talk to me nice no sassy
You can be the Damsel in distress, I'm the assassin

[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
Won't you be... my star
Baby won't you be... my star
Baby won't you be... my star
Baby won't you be... my star
Be my co-star...
Be my star
Baby won't you be my star
Baby won't you be my star
Baby won't you be my star
Be my co-star
