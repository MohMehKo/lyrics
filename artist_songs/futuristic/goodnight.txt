Uh, lately you been swimming in that bottle
I bet you won't remember shit tomorrow
Right now you having a good time
But an argument will quickly follow, hard pill to swallow
You thinking about our past
I called you and then I text you I said I wanted you back
Your friends was all in your ear and they told you it'd never last
But they don't understand these feelings won't ever pass
I'm at a loss for words unless I'm on the verse
You staying busy trying to do some things to calm your nerves
You don't know what's real or fake after all that you heard
You see my pictures and you think that I'm hardly concerned
It's just the opposite I'm changing for the better
I made a lot of decisions now I'm living to regret em
These women look so appealing they tempted me and I let em
But you always in my head with them its easy to forget em
Don't get it twisted my message is kinda scattered 
This fame it'll never change me but I admit that I'm flattered
I made a name and they claimed it, they even getting it tatted
I been chasing down the dream but you're the only thing that mattered
Matter of fact I have you on my mind all day and night
When you wrong I say you right because I know you hate to fight
But stay and fight I gotta cause I just can't let you go
We got a lot of problems but I had to let you know

I love you, I want you, I need you by my side
I know we got problems but we'll solve em
Everything's gon be alright
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
We'll talk about it in the morning 
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
We'll talk about it in the morning 
Goodnight

Uh, my family they love you just as much as me
If you was with somebody else then that would suck to see
I know these groupies get annoying, they wanna fuck with me
I used to entertain it but now baby I up and leave
Nobody ever got me the way you do
I'm different than that kid that they have grown to love on YouTube
Nobody knows my flaws and accepts them the way that you do
We used to just be friends and then we fell in love
Who knew that three years later I'd still be calling you baby
When I was without a car I would ask you and you'd take me
When I was without a job you got your father to pay me
And now that I'm making money I'm sharing it with you daily
My dreams is kinda changing because lately you been in em
Success isn't the same if I can't come home to dinner from you and my little boy 
I'm happy to call it home, before I hit the road I just thought that you should know 

I love you, I want you, I need you by my side
I know we got problems but we'll solve em
Everything's gon be alright
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
We'll talk about it in the morning 
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
We'll talk about it in the morning 
Goodnight

I love you, I want you (yeah, oh, oh, oh)
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
I love you, I want you, I need you by my side
I know we got problems but we'll solve em
Everything's gon be alright
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight

We'll talk about it in the morning after you make me pancakes
