[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
It's an implosion, can't control it
I been waiting my whole life for this moment
Well respected, oh you're so connected
But I been waiting my whole life for this moment
And now I'm on

[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
Last year I was staying in my mom house
Last year I couldn't catch no break
This year now I'm paying for my mom house
This year I got a crib in L.A
Last year they ain't wanna listen to me
This year I'm all they play
Last year they told me I would fall off
This year I found my way
Yo, everybody been waiting on me
"What's the latest from the greatest?"
That's in everybody conversation
Turned a hobby to an occupation, stop the hating
Place the stages all across the nation now I'm on the station
Things change, but I stayed the same
All the fame isn't worth your soul
I took my shot, and then I took my spot, and it ain't hard to tell, Now I think they know

[Pre-Hook 1 - Devvon Terrell & Futuristic:]
And I'm so on, I've been gone
Worked so hard, then it all payed off
Buzz so strong, don't get me wrong
I'm still moving up, take no days off
I been waiting for this moment, it's looking like I'm exploding
They comfortable
I been focused on dropping all of these vocals
And making them sound the dopest
Now people starting to notice like
"Dam, that boy cold cuh"

[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
It's an implosion, can't control it
I been waiting my whole life for this moment
Well respected, oh you're so connected
But I been waiting my whole life for this moment
And now I'm on

[Verse 2 - Futuristic:]
I'm only focused on me now
I ain't worried 'bout what everybody else do
I only ride with my team now
I ain't worried about anybody else crew
I know my grandma looking down
I just wanna make you proud, make you smile too
I know my ex-girl so mad
Hit me with a text, "shit it's been a while boo"
"Like how is you doing?" "That's cool!"
But I promise you I'm doing better
Get paid from these letters, I write in my phone it's so clever
The way that I put 'em together
I'm living swell now, my dreams well and my shoes new
My chain gold, and my hoops too
And I'm only in town for the night you should cruise through
Go a lot to do that includes you

[Pre-Hook 2 - Devvon Terrell & Futuristic:]
And I'm so on, I've been gone
Worked so hard, then it all payed off
Buzz so strong, don't get me wrong
I'm still moving up, take no days off
I'm just doing me, so beautifully, and truthfully
I always knew that it would happen had a passion for rapping
And packing out any places you could imagine like
"Oh, that boy cold cuh"

[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
It's an implosion, can't control it
I been waiting my whole life for this moment
Well respected, oh you're so connected
But I been waiting my whole life for this moment
And now I'm on
