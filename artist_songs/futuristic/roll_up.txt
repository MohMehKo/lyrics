[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
You know how I get when I'm inside my crib alone
Drink this, smoke this, out out all alone
So baby you should roll up, roll up, baby you should roll up, roll up

[Verse - Futuristic:]
Your face is amazing, your attitude is dangerous
Your pussy smell like candy, (Sheesh!)
I just wanna taste it, I mean how the fuck aren't you famous
I mean why the fuck are you single, Commercials say girls like you only stay on ChristianMingle
I mean where'd you get your smile from, How'd your booty get so fat?
I know you say what you think is slow but I wouldn't mind hitting that, I want to get drunk with you tomorrow be forgetting that, I'm a leader but the follow button I'll be clicking that
You are something that I never ever ever seen before
Only in my dreams of course, want your jeans to see the floor, want your shirt above your head, want your panties on the ground
Want my hands around your waist, want my penis in your- WOW
Whoopsies I mean I don't usually, I mean okay I do but you do too don't try to fool me
And I know you ain't no groupie so I really think you could, think you should uber to my place so you can do me good

[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
(Do me... goood)
You know how I get when I'm inside my crib alone
Drink this, smoke this, out [?] all alone
So baby you should roll up, roll up, baby you should roll up, roll up
