[Intro - Devvon Terrell & Futuristic:]
I feel like a billion dollars (What you worth, what you worth?)
Yeah, I feel like a billion dollars

[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
Yeah, yo
I feel like, look like, smell like, dressed like eighteen billion dollars
On the green like I'm a golfer, dressed like I'm an Harvard scholar
Pop my collar, not on Twitter much but everybody follow
I don't want no kids so all my chicks know that they have to swallow
Look like I own the whole block, might hit the beach with no socks
Wave to four cops, my taco get dropped
I'm cold like Dippin' Dots, I knew I was gon' pop
Futuristic been that nigga in the city
But now I'm all around the globe
My entire family been askin' for loans
So I'm throwin' money like I'm at a toll
Whoa, slow, yo, roll, bro, troll, essential part, green thumb
Nobody slowin' me down and you lookin' like you just hit five-hundred speed bumps
What I need is pussy, money and weed
A drink, something to eat
A microphone I can heat up
Don't try no funny shit with my money, bitch, or you might get beat up

[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
I feel like a billion dollars (What you worth, what you worth?)
I feel like a billion dollars (What you worth, what you worth?)
I feel like a billion dollars (What you worth, what you worth?)
I feel like a billion dollars

[Verse 2:?]
Yeah, feel like I'm worth a hundred billion dollars
Takin' trips out to Bahamas
Everyday we goin' harder, yeah
I don't want no problems, homie
You don't want this drama
Got that heat like I was Chalmers, damn
I was like, "Fuck is you sayin'?"
Like who the fuck are you playin'
Fuckin' insane
Bitch, I be runnin' the game
Feel like my name is Usain
Said it before on a track and I'll say it again
Don't come up on here if you not tryna pay
All you be doin' is ridin' the wave
Fuckin' with you, I got nothin' to gain
This sound like drug money
Shit sound like I love money
One day, I might meet Dre
Yo what up Doc, no Bugs Bunny
I know 'bout them long days
I don't really know 'bout them long nights
All I really know is now, I'm focused now
Should I put that all on my life? Goddamn

[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
I feel like a billion dollars (What you worth, what you worth?)
I feel like a billion dollars (What you worth, what you worth?)
I feel like a billion dollars (What you worth, what you worth?)
I feel like a billion dollars

[Verse 3:?]
I said, I came in for my money so don't get it Moosh & Twisted
I need a billion dollars so I hit up Futuristic
Plannin' on my own tour, swear I never lose the pivot
We all came here to ball so you would never see us scrimmage
This shit finna put me on vacay, if somebody goin' down call mayday
You let a plug get through a gateway
I get it for the low, man, no pay way
Goddamn, yeah, you know I'm a player
Look at your face, I know you a hater
My girl in the A, she stay in Decatur
But I'm right in Cali, I'm right off La Brea, let's get it
What's poppin'? They shootin', no problem
She choosin', no comment
Less bitches, more commas
Man, that's that motto for life
Pourin' and drinkin' a bottle of Sprite
He don't wanna pay, say bye to your wife
I need it in cash, it gotta be right

[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
I feel like a billion dollars (What you worth, what you worth?)
I feel like a billion dollars (What you worth, what you worth?)
I feel like a billion dollars (What you worth, what you worth?)
I feel like a billion dollars
Tell me how you feel, I feel like a billion dollars
Tell me how you feel, I feel like a billion dollars
Tell me how you feel, I feel like a billion dollars
Tell me how you feel, I feel like a billion dollars
