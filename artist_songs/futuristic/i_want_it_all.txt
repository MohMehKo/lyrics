[Hook - Devvon Terrell:]
I'm on the rise, I ain't tryin' to fall
They bangin' my line, don't answer the phone when they call
Gettin' outta control, I always wanted to ball
I got a lot, now I want it all
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all

[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
Sheesh, all I want is like everything
Yeah, I got a lot but I need better things
I want a crazy chain with hella diamonds in it
All the size of Kim K's wedding ring
I want a tour bus that cost a million bucks
Need a Lamborghini, doors open up
Call my homie Mogul he can pick me up
I need a chick that fucks that got a big ol' butt, sheesh
Honestly I be cool with takin' it easy
Maybe a TV so I can play my homies in FIFA
I need some speakers cause the way that I be spittin' these writtens
They need to listen, pay attention, cause I'm so undefeated
I need some storage in my phone cause my pictures gettin' deleted
I need some jeans with some creases, my money to be increasin'
A bunch of kids so inspired and I am the only reason
And when this video drop I want everybody to see it
Need some gear for my homies too
That's what brodies do, we all livin' large
I need a big garage that I can fit six cars
A chicks as thick as Nicki Minaj that gives massages
A house that looks just like Mister Rogers
A world where nobody tryna pick my pockets
That'd be awesome, I know that I spit the hardest
I want my records on spin cycle like a washer

I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all

[Verse 2 - Devvon Terrell:]
Oh my God, hungry for anything
I want it all and I'm still in my skinny jeans
I want red carpets and cameras all for my team
Every step we takin', light up like Billie Jean
Makin' haters disappear like that Houdini
Who are you and what are you gonna say to me?
When I got it, I don't think I will stop it
I off all these Jokers like Batman and Robin
Turn the heat up, only wear sweaters now when it's freezing
Cause I know I will suffer from a black card fever
And I would never drive and I know that they will wonder why
Like why? Duh, so I can sit and text when I drive
I mean you only live once and I don't wanna die doin' it
I'd rather be safe instead of sayin' I fuckin' ruined it
So everyday I'm faded and everybody be waitin'
For the moves that I be makin', I get it, that's what I'm sayin'
On everything I love, on everything I love
I just want it all and I'm gon' fight all day and I'm gon' fight all day
So if you try to stop me, motherfucker, get it poppin', boy
You never better blink or I'm a leave you Fetty Wapin', you should stop it
You should drop it, this is obvious and every motherfucker that see this after is probably gonna wanna copy it
