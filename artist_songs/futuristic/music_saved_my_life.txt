As a child I would dream about it
Sometimes it wake me from my sleep and I would think about it
Making music was all that could keep me off these streets
I don't know where I'd actually be without it, but think about it
I dedicated like twenty years to the goal
I still ain't made a name for myself and it's getting old
How many more words can I enter into this phone
Without running out of topics and dropping interesting quotes
I know people around the globe is wishing that they had a chance
To get they hands on that advance that I just passed up
Hit the road and have at least two-hundred people at every show
Smoking until I choke, that sounds mad fun
And being able to pay my bills is a plus
But money I be spending for promos is twice as much
Not to mention if you get in to the club with all these other rappers then you gotta have the nicest stuff
So fuck it, man, I'm drinking 'til I'm blacking out
They know me around the city for acting out
My dad visited for the weekend, he got a taste
And left a day early, hit me with a text, "what's that about?"
I told him, "it's okay, it's not a problem"
But everyone around me seem to think that I can't stop it
But yet they always wanna go out on my tab, they jobless
And they looking for a way to get it popping
So I got them, I start chilling with my old friends
They all married with good careers
Envious of what I'm doing
But only if they knew
I would trade them for a second and be outta here
But I'm too addicted to this music
And I got eight siblings that I never see
In a room I never leave
Stuck on my computer watching other niggas catch some speed
All they songs is extra weak, confusion steady stressing me
Running out of patience, let the journey get the best of me
Thought I had the recipe, so I followed every step
Left my girl and moved away, I know she happy I left
Lil bro is all alone, mama need a bigger check
All my niggas falling off, I'm still tryna be the best
Locked myself inside this booth, started making hella tracks
Cry myself to sleep at night, swear I been to hell and back
Loaded up that gun I bought, withdrew everything I had
Put it all in envelopes, had it sitting in my hand
Wrote my mama letter, and apologized for suicide
I been on a mission that they talk about but few will try
Had my finger on the trigger, would have left it all behind
And lyrics popped into my head, maybe music saved my life
Maybe music saved my life
Maybe music saved my life
Maybe music saved my life
Yeah, maybe music saved my life
