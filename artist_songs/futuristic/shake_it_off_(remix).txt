[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
Came through with the same old team
If they hate on me then I say okay
Same vids more views everyday
I'm the greatest too easy never get no way
Flow cold everyday a snow day
Little rascal I say "otay"
Little Ron homie never roleplay eat chicken in the air
Damn that's so play

Who woulda thunk I could rap like this
On a track like this
Light a match like this
Might smash T Swift
Make her ass get big
Here my song on the radio crash my whip
Whoo
I'm tryna stack my chips
Flow like chex
All my snacks just mix
And my tracks is lit
When I snap my pic
Need a flash, I'm black why I act like this

Okay I hit it then I shake it off
If she a KitKat bet that I'm a break her off
Walk in the store and cop it don't care about the cost
Like hide and seek I suggest that you go get lost
I swear that I can rap on anything you give me
WTF is suspect where you get that shit from missy
Non of my verses is Iffy
I stuck to the bread like Jiffy
Rappers all suck so much if you listen you might get hickies
I'm gone

[Verse 2 - Devvon Terrell:]
You say that you know me never seen you in my life
I do this and I do that but homie you don't know my life
Know that I'm right
See that I'm up and you tight
Say that you beating' me psyche
This ain't a pipe
I brought a gun you a knife
Pop it like you walk like you might
But you never be scoring
You winnin' is foreign
And I am exciting
And you are so boring
You sleeping you snoring
Eye of the tiger I'm roaring
I pull the hair and you balding
Why do you force it
Leaks in your pipe like a faucet
Bouncin' you around your new name is Holden
Whoo!
Fee Fi Fo Fum
I'm giant I'm bigger than you
Sorry to break it to you
Shaking you off and I'm finally feeling much better
Body a Taylor Swift record
This is a record
Tell me who gon' do it better
Call you up brrr, hello
Shook up you jello
I'm slowing you down like it's yellow
Cause even Adele can say hello, hello

Everybody hatin' get them off of me
You say I can't do it but we gon' see
Can't nobody stop em' you're annoying
Go home Roger
I ain't talking just to talk oh I'm just really trying to stop ya
