[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
Yo, yo, she wanna fuck the whole squad, ya damn skippy
We smoking hella trees, like a damn hippy
And I'm so tipsy, I go bobby, she so whitney
KFC flow, I'm so crispy and I hustle, call me Nipsey
Rookie of the year, right? Nah bitch I'm a veteran
Flow sick I need some medicine, to get better than I've ever been
Rock shit, led zeppelin, money hungry, where that cheddar went?
Been places that you never been, I shine like Thomas Edison
Everything you ever spit, has never been as clever as
The lyrics that I'm sketching on this paper with this F'ing pen
Moving up, like the Jeffersons, celebrity, y'all pedestrians
I graduated, don't test the kid, yo girl wanna molest the kid
She down to do anything that I freaking tell her
She can't see, but she feeling me just like Helen Keller
I'm hella stellar, fella jump up off my cock, bitch
Hop into the moshpit, we be on that rock shit

[Hook - Chanel Arione, Futuristic:]
Hey baby I'm a rockstar, I said baby I'm a rockstar, hey baby I'm a rockstar
I said baby I'm a rockstar, I told you I'm a rockstar
Everybody getting loud, bitch I'm a rockstar, I be jumping in the crowd
Bitch I'm a rockstar, girls pulling titties out, bitch I'm a rockstar
Turn me up, don't turn me down, bitch I'm a rockstar

[Verse 2 - Futuristic:]
Future got a band, you damn straight
Shows twice a week, check the fanpage
Cause I be grinding, flow so hot could change the climate
Doctor Seuss boy, I be rhyming
All these labels trynna sign me, yup
You know where to find me, prolly with yo chick boy
I got one, I got two, I got three, I got four, I got five
I got six, boy
WTF click boy, vommit, flow so sick boy
All my squad is cool kids, you an Outkast, Big Boi
This it boy, I do it big, my flow colder than the a fridge
Getting all these girls wet, like water underneath a bridge
Guzzling I need to piss, she want in, she on the list
Baking all this crazy weed, it's stinky like a freaking pig
She need a pic to put on her page, I need a mic and I need a stage
I need a beat and I need some bass
I need a drink to throw in your face
Hate if you wanna nigga I don't even give a fuck
A thousand people in the crowd with their dubs up

[Hook - Chanel Arione, Futuristic]

[Outro - Jazz & The Giant:]
After, after party, bitches everywhere you look
Music bumping loud, you'd think the ground beneath you shook
Rude niggas affiliated with getting money
Back the fuck up, cause you ain't got nothing for me
I'm a rockstar, bitch I'm a rockstar
I'm a rockstar, I'm a rockstar
