[Hook - D. Fields, Futuristic, K.I.D, SK4MC:]

[Verse 1 - D. Fields:]
Wait wait wait wait ummm

They girl is Jamaican she Asian persuasion
Persuasion she makin' donations
She solvin' equations you niggas be fakin'
You niggas be chasin' you niggas be fakin'
You fuckin' weirdoes in your earlobes
And this, I'm a very odd fellow
A bunch of white bitches that's a bag of marshmallows
Hello, I like jello
Rock with the beat I could rock with the beat or rock it accapello
Fu- Fuck is you sayin', fuck is you sayin'
You niggas just playin'
K-I-D and Mr. da man we killin' these beats these niggas like damn!

[Verse 2 - Mr. Man:]
Mask on, Mask off Las Vegas to A-Z
Then back to cali chillin' on the beach
With my Asian bitch she rollin weed
Watch ya' got for me (watch ya' got for me)
Raw papers (Swisher Sweets)
Me and Freddy Krueger be rollin up
Hot boxin' in these bitches dreams
Add mrman2thatop a hundred thousand what I'm sittin' on
Real nigga ya'll silicon, see the team and you mad cause your bitch is gone
I'm a cali nigga fuck with a couple brauds but never found me without FxL the gang
Stick around you see us, me and futuristic

[Verse 3 - Futuristic:]
Ya, ride around like two chainz
Steel toe kicking it, Liu Kang
I'll I really need is some
I'm a bad girl who got two brains
And they too strange, I'm to main, I run the game Usain
Keep it tied down like shoe strings, that hot flow, Blue flame
Fu- fuck you mean boy my squad is W-T-F
Getcha' mind right, or you will be left
Plus your bitch snatch train her like a gym rat
No six pack and my pockets on big black
You ain't never fucked with a nigga like me before don't try it
I'm not a hood nigga but you know I have goons that will spray at you like fire hydrants
We be on that la la la and now everybody look lost
Fuck swag you know I got that sauce

[Verse 4 - K.I.D:]
Well I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
What the fuck ya'll niggas thought?
And ya'll niggas must be paralyzed cause all you do is talk
Alright well lemonade 200 thousand
We can 200 thousand, Headlines 800 thousand
Ya nigga my shit is astoundin', uh!
I guess you can close your mouth then
Cause you ain't got shit to say
Talkin bout my album when you bastards ain't got shit to play
Buy a mask and switch your face that's all really you can do
I'm a keep on winning cause I really don't know how to loose

[Verse 5 - SK4MC:]
I'm pissed off
Turn on the t.v shiny ass rappers
But they're softer than my lip gloss.
I'm a big boss, got a big beard
Take big shits like Rick Ross
Recognize or get lost
You kiss girls I trick off
Then get mad and up a guy that cut his dick off
Tha- that's a [?] look inside your granny panties
Futuristic said I only get eight bars but fuck that shit

Cause I be high I'm a whip that trick
I ain't really buff but I'm a nerd I got them

[Hook]

[Verse 6 - D-Why:]
(The macchiato music everybody rockin' to it always stayin on some new shit)
Ahh! I'm the motherfuckin' man D in this bitch
To much stress I don't need that shit
Q that stress you don't need that shit
Take that off you can leave that shit
Man, they say they miss my old shit, wait until they here my new shit
A lot of people talk shit but really do they do shit
I knew in the beginning that the only way to win it was to do it by myself so I'm all about business
Got a lot of bad bitches man, can I get a witness
Man, can I get a benz or a car with no limit
Got a new chick she sleezy tryin fall asleep she tease me
(Hold up!) my dick hard but this rapper shit to easy
Whatchin' wall street thinkin' bout money you can call me micheal thugless
You know all my cares are fuckless, all my relationships are loveless
See it's just me and my cousins and every one of us buzzin
Our video shit on all ya'll we do this without no budget (ahh!)
