[Intro:]
Ha, yeah, okay, yeah, they call me Future, yeah, you already know, I see you Rerun, yeah, yo

[Verse 1:]
Mister I had to do it, what the question is?
Now I'm back with the words like dislexic kids
I just spit, throw it up like anorexic chicks
I'm a celebrity, y'all niggas just pedestrians
And I'm a go harder then a nigga ever has
Mister Futuristic spitting, so forget about the past
All these other rappers garbage, you can throw it in the trash
If you don't like what I'm saying, you can kiss my fucking ass
Yeah and I'm back, this track going hard a fuck
Merk a nigga quick, leave his body for the garbage truck
Stictly business, bitches, y'all ain't harming us
I'm 50 Cent in bulletproof, you better get ya armor up
Don't be anonymous like Bobby Valentino
If you talk over the web, I got something to kill your ego
My flow terminal, fatal, lethal
After the lesson, be prepared for the sequel

[Hook:]
I'm Mister I had to do it, Mister I had to do it
Mister I had to do it, Mister I had to do it
Aye, he snapping, spit sicker then cancer
If you got a question, best believe he got the answer
I'm Mister I had to do it, Mister I had to do it
Mister I had to do it, Mister I had to do it
Aye, who calling? Step into my office
If you got a problem, best believe that I'm a solve it

[Verse 2:]
Mister I had to do it, what the problem is?
Got more paper than a book for a college kid
This is how to go hard for dummies, you should follow it
Never spit it, she swallow it, I think she need a scholarship
And I'm a get every groupie that done ever doubted me
They niggas not as hot as me, cause Future is the prodigy
Better yet, I'm cold like track fifteen, I could make lava freeze
Lotta cheese, probably 'bout to go up on a shopping spree
I'm fresh than a motherfucker
She in the dress, left work, two kids, we had sex, I'm a motherfucker
And I could tell she was impressed, than a motherfucker
She asked my age, I told her, then she left like a motherfucker
I laid in bed butt naked then I just laughed
On to the next, I get it popping like the gun blast
She came back, I told her, "step into my office"
I think we need to schedule a parent teacher conference

[Hook]

[Outro:]
Yeah, I kinda like that auto-tune shit, yeah, fuck with me and SB in the building, let's get it, yeah, I'm Mister I had to do it, Mister I had to do it, Mister I had to do it, Mister I had to do it, aye, let's get it, what they call me?: Futuristic
Gone...
