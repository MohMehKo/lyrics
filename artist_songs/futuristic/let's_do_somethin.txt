[Hook:]
I ain't got no plans today
You ain't got no plans today
So let's do something
I ain't got no plans today
You ain't got no plans today
So let's do something
I ain't got no plans today
You ain't got no plans today
So let's do something
I ain't got no plans today
You ain't got no plans today
So let's do something
Let's do something you ain't never did
Let's do something you ain't never did (oh, no, no)
Let's do something you ain't never did
Let's do something you ain't never did (oh, yeah, yeah)
Let's do something you ain't never did
Let's do something you ain't never did (oh, no, no)
Let's do something you ain't never did
Let's do something you ain't never did (oh, yeah, yeah)

[Verse:]
Yeah, let's get a carton of eggs and then throw them at people on the sidewalk
Give them a twenty and tell them you got tourettes
I was watching you so technically it's my fault
Let's fuck on the counter top
Hike to the mountain top
Yell something crazy
Let's have a baby
Actually, let's not do that just yet, you got any condoms?
Ah, fuck it, let's roleplay
I could be your boyfriend
You could be Marcia Brady
Let's do karaoke; "The Real Slim Shady"
Or we could go ice skating
Jump out of a plane
Oh, your boobs is fake?
I heard that they could pop, do you care?
They real? You straight
Let's make a song and the chorus go:
"Everybody hands in the air"
That's clich√©
Tonight you could be a DJ
I'm a be a fan, put the song on replay
I'm feeling like ScHoolBoy, this year I'm the man
We could go to Japan, Tokyo Drift
Call someone you hate
Tell them they're a bitch
We could take a dance slash workout class
Where they show you how to move your hips
Let's get an iguana or somthing
You should give me head at the movies
Let's go to the store, get a whole lotta fruit
I'd be cool, we could make our own smoothies
Let's rent a room at the W
Throw a huge party and leave them with a mess
Let's got to the park
No panties with a dress
Let's sit on the swing and have sex, yes
