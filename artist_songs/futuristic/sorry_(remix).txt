[Verse 1 - Devvon Terrell:]
I can see you in but I can't change, no
And they talking all crazy but they never
Say it to your face, no
They ask 'bout your business
They just looking like bulls running and charging
I'm seeing red and I'm 'bout to snap like I'm Dennis Rodman
I'm testing all theses niggas I feel like I am the problem
Fitted like I'm Gucci and all you haters is targets
I feel like I'm next up and nobody in here messing with us
I'm up in the roof and you still waiting in the elevator and when
You here I feel like we going through another level
I'm Meghan Trainor when I'm acapella
Cause I am the bass to the treble, I am the good to the devil
And I know I'm eating good and
You at McDonald's looking for specials
I feel like I got it so why would I stop it
Let me ask you a question

[Hook 1 - Devvon Terrell:]
Is it too late to say I'm sorry?
Cause I feel like no one can stop me
Is it too late to say I'm sorry
I know they know that I coming now
I feel like my time is now

[Verse 2 - Futuristic:]
Sorry for killing everything I touch like I'm a plague
Making it look easy while they all losing an arm and leg
Record a verse on my seg, I forgot how to walk
All that I do is rap now, I forgot how to talk
I've been up without sleeping
I'm greedy success I need it
My progress never impeded
My haters I just delete 'em
Soon as they give me reasons I leave them in pieces
I might just pull out my visa
I got more money on that than Regis
Sheesh, who want to be it they quitting till I got millions
I spit that real, to the blind hands, out everybody feeling
I step into the building with my homies looking dabber
On a Justin Bieber beat with confidence like Chance The Rapper
Anyone that does it after I'm watching nothing but laughter
I'm reading the comments nothing but positive chitter-chatter
I was just in New York with the homie doing the most
Now I'm in L.A. wait till you niggas hear Coast 2 Coast

[Hook 2 - Futuristic:]
Is it too late now to say sorry because I miss you more than your body
(Country album coming soon)
Is it too late now to say sorry I know, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm a sorry now
