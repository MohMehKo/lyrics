Do it again
She said to me
So I nailed my hand to the baseboard floor 
Hysterically
Laughing at me
She begged the question and I begged for more 
Now I water 
The thorn you rammed
Deep into my side watch it fertalize
Cause you shoved your finger 
Right down my throat
And you made me puke up all of my pride

Pop the Beach Balls
Burn the photos
C-4 your safe 
And you'll never grow old
So get out of touch
And become a thought 
Cause once you’re a thought, hopefully you're forgot

If we break up
Don’t write a song that would
Drag my name through the shit, the mud 
Cause I’ve seen some solid swimmers who drowned
When you unleashed the dam and cause the flood
But with free choice
There comes freewill
And I’m so happy she decided to leave
Cause now I’m alone
Demons come home
And now my plan is rolling up it’s sleeve 

Pop the Beach Balls
Burn the photos
C-4 your safe 
And you'll never grow old
So get out of touch
And become a thought 
Cause once you’re a thought, hopefully you're forgot

Pop the Beach Balls
Burn the photos
C-4 your safe 
And you'll never grow old
So get out of touch
And become a thought 
Cause once you’re a thought, hopefully you're forgot

Because my morale's begun to decay
And all my friends have the same thing to say
They say that good times have faded away
They say that their all worried about me
Cause I feed birds in the cemetery
And I rake leaves off the grass in my grave
Because my memory lane is now paved
(Nothing's wrong)
My memory lane is now paved
(There’s nothing wrong)
My memory lane is now paved
(Nothing's wrong)
My memory lane is now paved
(There’s nothing wrong)
But now my memory’s back and there’s nothing   wrong
There’s nothing wrong
There’s nothing wrong
There’s nothing wrong
I said there’s nothing wrong
There’s nothing wrong
There’s nothing wrong
There’s nothing wrong
