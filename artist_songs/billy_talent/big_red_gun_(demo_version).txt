Brothers in arms that share my fears,
Time to protect what you hold dear.
There's been a rise in new ideas,
Threatening to change the way we live.

Who knows what trouble's found a way,
Found a way to your door again.
Who knows what trouble's on its way,
On its way to intimidate.

All I want is a big red gun
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh
I'm gonna shoot, shoot, shoot at the setting sun
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh
And all I want is a big red gun,
I'm gonna shoot, shoot, shoot till the thrill is gone
'Cause this is my right no matter the cost
Stay outta my sight, 'cause baby's got a big red gun
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh
Baby's got a big red gun
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh

Pride is a weapon in your hand.
Freedom awards the faithful man.
Power's the game and blood will spill,
A God given right we must fulfill.

And Lord I just can't walk away,
Walk away from the enemy.
The law will never disagree,
On the target of my insecurities.

All I want is a big red gun
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh
I'm gonna shoot, shoot, shoot at the setting sun
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh
And all I want is a big red gun,
(Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh)
I'm gonna shoot, shoot, shoot till the thrill is gone
And how many lives will have to be lost,
(Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh)
To understand why my baby's got a big red gun?

Baby's got a big red gun
Baby's got a big red gun
Baby's got a big red gun
Baby's got a big red gun

You call me twisted and deranged,
(Baby's got a big red gun)
But they gave me the keys to annihilate
(Baby's got a big red gun)
The voice inside my head will mow you down
(Baby's got a big red gun)
And all your sins will wash away,
(Baby's got a big red gun)
Wash away in eternal flame.
(Baby's got a big red gun)
The judge and jury stand before you now.
(Baby's got a big red gun)

'Cause baby's got a big red gun
Baby's got a big red gun
Baby's got a big red gun
The fight has only just begun.
