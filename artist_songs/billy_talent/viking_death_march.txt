Hey!

Down, let's take it down
Raise up their heads on a stake
We will show no mercy
On evolution's mistake

Change will have to wait
If we can't decide on a fate
Self-appointed prophets
And their doomsday charade

You preach about love
And teach about faith
But all your beliefs are still rooted in hate

[x2:]
Crosses still burn
Axes still fall
And down on your knees you just don't look so tall

Stop, punch in the clock
Punch it with all of your rage
Put the men in office
For a minimum wage

Rats fighting for scraps
Siphon the gas from your tank
Left your pockets empty
As they laughed to the bank

They speak about trust
But make no mistake
They're shaking your hand while they spit in your face

[x2:]
Crosses still burn
Axes still fall
And down on your knees you just don't look so tall

Now, the time is now
We can still turn it around
Raise your voice like a weapon
'Til they fall to the ground

Light, let there be light
Without a shadow of doubt
We will fight tooth and nail
Until salvation is found

So how can you look the world in the eyes
When all we can see is corruption and lies

Down on your knees you don't look so tall [x2]

Cracking the whip on the backs of the poor
We asked you to stop but you still wanted more
The blood on your hands left a trail as you crawl
Down on your knees you just don't look so tall

[x3:]
Crosses still burn
Axes still fall
Down on your knees you just don't look so tall

Crosses still burn
Axes still fall
Down on your knees you don't look so tall
Open your eyes and the empire falls
