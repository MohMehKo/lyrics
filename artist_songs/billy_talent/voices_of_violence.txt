Don't wait for, a knight in shining armor
Your savior's, reflected in the mirror
These flowers, have grown from bloodstains on the ground
Go rake them, leaves off your grass and my grave
The fact is, everyone bleeds when they shave
There's no use, so don't deny we're just the same

We'll take it back (Broken Dagger! Southern Swagger!)
Voices of violence, voices of violence
We'll take it back (Broken Dagger! Southern Swagger!)
Voice of violence, voices of violence

These cowboys, will ride off in the sunset
Once their toys, have turned another profit 
Backfire, these smoking guns will never rest
Unleash the, skeletons from the closet
These strangers, are friends that you've never met 
They'll send them, sympathies with a hallmark card

We'll take it back (Broken Dagger! Southern Swagger!)
Voices of violence, voices of violence
We'll take it back (Broken Dagger! Southern Swagger!)
Voice of violence, voices of violence

Even after im dead and buried 
I'll still remember, I'l still remember 
Even after im dead and buried 
I'll still remember, I'l still remember 
Even after im dead and burried 
I'll come back for fighting, I'll come back fighting

We'll take it back (Broken Dagger! Southern Swagger!)
Voices of violence, voices of violence
We'll take it back (Broken Dagger! Southern Swagger!)
Voice of violence, voices of violence

Voices of violence will always be heard 
Voices of violence, voices of violence
voices of violence will always be heard
Voices of violence, voices of violence
