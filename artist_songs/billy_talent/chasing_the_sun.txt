We try to stay young, by chasing the sun.
You blink for too long, the swan sing a song.
And all that I've lost, and all that I've won,
Don't mean nothing more when you open your eyes and they're gone.

After all we've been told, we're still flesh and bone.
And life's worth much more than silver and gold.
And all that I've lost, and all that I've won,
Don't mean nothing more when you open your eyes and they're gone.

And how could it be that we'll never see
The first day of spring and the last autumn leaves?
So lost in my mind, I try to stay strong.
If wounds heal in time tell me why it's so hard to move on,

Hard to move ooooon;
I'll never move ooooon.

I curse the mistakes that we'll never make,
The pictures of trips that we'll never take.
And all of these thoughts, they keep me awake.
Hang on to your heroes before it's too late.
Cause there'll come a time when you open your eyes and they're gone.

Some day they're gone,
Some day they'll be gone.

And I'll still be here chasing the sun...
