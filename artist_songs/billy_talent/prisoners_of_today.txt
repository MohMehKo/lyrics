I never bit off more than I can chew,
But then she came and bit me
I never bit off more than I can chew but then she bit my leg
She said "dont wanna work I wanna play and live my life like it was Sunday!"
"The only problem is that Sunday only comes now once a week and I'm a freak but..."

We're breaking up the city,
No time for wasting away
So tell me why should we stay, 
Prisoners Of Today!

My body's tired, my souls excited and i wish that i was gifted,
My body's tired my soul's excited and I wish I had some spunk,
She said "I wanna run, I wanna hide, and leave this place just like it left me"
"The only problem is I need to find the balls to follow through and that's the truth now..."

We're breaking up the city,
No time for wasting away,
So tell me why should we stay,
Prisoners of today!

When there's no time for one another?

Cause this our time and our space..
History I can't erase!

We're breaking up the city,
No time for wasting away,
So tell me why should we stay,
Prisoners of today!

When there's no time for one another
There's no time for one another??
