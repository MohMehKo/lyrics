Hey!

Another tragedy has set the scene for conscience to be revealed
At home the February, February winds are howling

Don't tell me we're adversaries
Don't tell me we're sworn enemies
'Cause we all need necessary
Means to protect what we love

An ocean lies between us, suffering's a constant we never see
Behind our sanctuary, sanctuary walls it's so easy to breathe
Where is our empathy? Has empathy been lost while drifting at sea?
We are the refugees, divided we'll survive on hope

So don't tell me we're adversaries
Don't tell me we're sworn enemies
'Cause we all need necessary
Means to protect what we love

Light up your book of matches
Open your hearts to action
We all need second chances
What reason to help but for love?

February winds
February winds

No we are not adversaries
We were not born enemies
We all need necessary
Means to protect what we love

Light up your book of matches
Open your hearts to action
We all need second chances
What reason to help but for love?

We are not adversaries
We are not sworn enemies
We all need necessary
Means to protect what we love

February winds
The message that we send
Will come back in the end
