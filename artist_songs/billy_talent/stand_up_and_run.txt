Oh I had a feeling
Buried inside
Covered beneath a
Blanket of pride
Oh I couldn't tell you
How my heart felt inside
In so little time

Stand up and run
Stand up and run
Stand up and run
Stand up and run
Into my arms

Chasing the bright lights
This city got old
You walked out of my life
And into the cold
It's hard to imagine that you'd
Never come home
Forever alone

Stand up and run
Stand up and run
Stand up and run
Stand up and run
Into my arms

Stand up and run
Stand up and run
Stand up and run
Stand up and run
Into my heart

Can't you see there is no logic to love?
And we're lost just like the stars up above
If I'd only known how you'd make me feel
I would kiss the ground that touches your heel
After all these years of being apart
Don't let reason try to tear us apart
If the compass breaks then follow your heart
And I hope it leads you right back into my arms

(Stand up and run)
And the time has past
(Stand up and run)
We'll still make it last
(Stand up and run)
And I hope this leads you right back into my arms
Oh into my arms

Oh I had a feeling
Buried inside
