I should have turned and walked away
But I got tangled in your chains
A trail of dead for all to see
You shut the cage and stole the key

Your state of mind revealed
That my love for you was real
They say in time wounds heal
But I got nothing left to steal

My mouth is shut, my lips are sealed
You are the crutch of this disease
And I've been locked in your machine
Sit here and rot, or break this deal

I spill my blood on the checkered floor
You got me crawling back for more
You set the trap, I'll take the bait
A bed of nails I can't escape

Your state of mind revealed
That my love for you was real
They say in time wounds heal
But I got nothing left to steal

My mouth is shut, my lips are sealed
You are the crutch of this disease
And I've been locked in your machine
Sit here and rot, or break this deal

Now it's so dark that I can't see
The mental scars you left on me
So dig your nails and grind your teeth
I'm in your clutch for eternity

Yeah, I know it's hard for you to see
The mental scars you left on me
So dig your nails and grind your teeth
I'm in your clutch for eternity

My mouth is shut, my lips are sealed
You are the crutch of this disease
And I've been locked in your machine
Sit here and rot, or break this deal

Oh, my mouth is shut, my lips are sealed
You are the crutch of this disease
And I've been locked in your machine
Sit here and rot, or break this deal
