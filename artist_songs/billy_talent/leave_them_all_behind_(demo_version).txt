Tired of all the promises and never coming through
It's easy to pretend until they turn their back on you
And all the ones that bring you down, their colours weren't that true
And life's become a battle that you swore you'd never lose

It don't matter what went wrong this time, don't matter what went right
We're always searching for the reason why
And the longest road to find it will take many years to climb
Don't wait here for that moment to arrive

Leave them all behind

Yeah I'm tired of all the promises, they're never coming through
It's easy to pretend until they turn their back on you
Yeah and all the ones that bring you down, their colours weren't that true
And when you lose your confidence, your mind plays tricks on you

It don't matter what went wrong in life, don't matter what went right
We're always searching for the reason why
And the longest road to find it will take many years to climb
We keep on getting stuck here all the time

We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna catch that train, the words they say
Couldn't stop us if they tried
We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna catch that train, I know some day
Everything's gonna fall in line

I've been struck down and defeated every step along the way
Become your own worst enemy when nothing seems to change
You have to fail a thousand times before you get it straight
So catch me if you can, 'cause I ain't leaving this to fate

It don't matter what went wrong this time, don't matter what went right
We're always searching for the reason why
And the longest road to find it will take many years to climb
We keep on getting stuck here all the time

We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna catch that train, the words they say
Couldn't stop us if they tried
We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna catch that train, I know some day
Everything's gonna fall in line

Tired of all the promises, they're never coming through
Waiting for that moment to arrive

We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna catch that train, the words they say
Couldn't stop us if they tried
We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna catch that train, I know some day
Everything's gonna fall in line
We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna catch that train, I know some day
Everything's gonna fall in line
Yeah!
