The sun has born a brand new day
Conscience has been cast away 
Evil has been blessed with praise
Heroes end up in their graves 

So who will be our saviour now they've shot your angels to the ground?

It's a lonely road to absolution
We must walk alone
It's a lonely road to absolution
We must walk alone

We can't take back the days we've borrowed
No more time to kill tomorrow
No more time to kill tomorrow
