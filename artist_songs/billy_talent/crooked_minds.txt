Crooked minds have gone astray
Have they never learned from yesterday?
Only a fool would wear the crown
One day the kids will tear it down

Yeah

Can't you see the clocks are ticking away?
They try to fit more hours into the day
The CPU is crunching numbers away
We're running out breath just to keep up the pace

And when did the revolver start the race?
When did the revolver start the race?

Accelerated architecture creates
A manufactured lifestyle for the deranged
They swallow up the green and build up the grey
And let tomorrows kids dispose of today

And when do you think the roof will bottom out?
When do you think the roof will bottom out?

Crooked minds under grey skies
They can't live 'til something dies
(The kids will tear it down)
'Til something dies
(The kids will tear it down)

Crooked minds ain't satisfied
'Til the ground touches the sky
(The kids will tear it down)
Touches the sky
(The kids will tear it down)

Cemetery statue stare into space
Sucked into a social media craze
They're looking for an answer to explain
The reason why disaster strikes again

A picture perfect family sits at the lake
Swimming in a sea of mechanical waste
And can't they see a tragedy awaits?
Can't they see a tragedy awaits?

Crooked minds under grey skies
They can't live 'til something dies
(The kids will tear it down)
'Til something dies
(The kids will tear it down)

Crooked minds ain't satisfied
'Til the ground touches the sky
(The kids will tear it down)
Touches the sky
(The kids will tear it down)

We'll tear it down

Cauterize these bloodshot eyes
Tangled in their power lines
Tear the ground up with their knives
Raise the caskets in the sky
Someday soon they'll realize
Nothing's left for you and I
Nothing's left for you and I

Crooked minds have gone astray

Nothing lives 'til something dies
