Watching a time-bomb ticking away
Watching a time-bomb, nobody cares 'til it's too late
Watching a time-bomb ticking away
Watching a time-bomb, you better pray you're somewhere safe

Transfixed on a piss-yellow sky
Watch another tank of gasoline burn dry
Death stare from her cold dead eyes
As she's chopping up the carrots, sharpening the knives
Don't blink, keep your eyes on the prize
While you rip me into pieces, cut me down to size
Don't dare try to keep it inside
'Cause the only way to make us laugh is to make us cry!

Just when you thought you'd seen it all
A storm awaits behind the door
Disgruntled right down to the core
We still go on

Watching a time-bomb ticking away
Watching a time-bomb, nobody cares till it's too late
Watching a time-bomb ticking away
Watching a time-bomb, you better pray you're somewhere safe

Beat down like a slave to the grind
I got a rocket launcher going off inside my mind
Dark clouds bottled up inside
Every thought about the future leaves me terrified
I'm sick of the same old lines
Why don't you talk about your feelings? Who gives a shit about mine?
Death grips cut a thorn in my side
'Cause the only way to make us laugh is to make us cry!

Just when you thought you'd seen it all
A storm awaits behind the door
Disgruntled right down to the core
We still go on

Watching a time-bomb ticking away
Watching a time-bomb, nobody cares till it's too late
Watching a time-bomb ticking away
Watching a time-bomb, you better pray you're somewhere safe

Oh, we got a time-bomb ticking away inside
And the only way to make us laugh is to make us cry

Watching a time-bomb ticking away
Watching a time-bomb ticking away
Watching a time-bomb ticking away

You're watching a time-bomb ticking away inside
And the only way to make us laugh is to make us cry
You're watching a time-bomb ticking away inside
Everybody needs a little help but the world is blind
You're watching a time-bomb ticking away inside
And the only way to make us laugh is to make us cry

You're watching a time-bomb ticking away
You're watching a time-bomb ticking away
You're watching a time-bomb ticking away
You're watching a time-bomb ticking away (I won't spend another day)
You're watching a time-bomb ticking away (Locked up in a metal cage)
You're watching a time-bomb ticking away (The world is a better place)
You're watching a time-bomb ticking away (I won't spend another day)
You're watching a time-bomb ticking away (Locked up in a metal cage)
You're watching a time-bomb ticking away (I know we can never change)
