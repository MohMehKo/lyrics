Swimming in the dark, we're bound to drift apart
And I just can't go on, pretending we're in love.
We play with matches in the rain but never learn
We try to light it but the fire never burns
You thought that love was just a casting call,
well its our turn to quit before the curtain falls

Don't need to pretend to love me, you don't need to pretend to want me,
You don't need to pretend to need me, we just never were meant to,
Am I wrong?
Am I right?
Have I lost my mind, lost my mind

Now I dance around her heart, like an actor plays the part.
I hit the stage and I get blinded by the light,
I read the script, but I just can't recite the lines
You thought that love was just a casting call,
well its our turn to quit before the curtain falls

Don't need to pretend to love me, we just never were meant to ever be,
You don't need to pretend to love me, we just never were meant to,
Am I wrong?
Am I right?
Have I lost my mind [x2]

So get on with your life 'cause we're just wasting time.
