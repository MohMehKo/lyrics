Oh this heart was made of gold
Now it's blackened like a coal burns red
I need to find a role model
Like I need a hole in my head

Don't need to change the time honey
I'm already half past dead

Strike me 'til I break, then turn me into flames
'Cause round and around, you can't go down
Without a pound and an ounce of pain
I wake up, find again my shadow haunts me 'til the end
'Cause round and around, you can't go down
Without a pound and an ounce of pain

Oh the darkest black her soul
But her lips were painted ocean green
And once I drank her potion
A witch came back to haunt my dreams

Don't need to change the time honey
I'm already half past dead

Strike me 'til I break, then turn me into flames
'Cause round and around, you can't go down
Without a pound and an ounce of pain
I wake up, find again my shadow haunts me 'til the end
'Cause round and around, you can't go down
Without a pound and an ounce of pain

Round and around you can't go down
'til your face don't match your name

And I can't stop the rain
That's falling down with no escape
Years go by, you lose your mind
And your face don't match your name

I curse the world in vain
My stubborn heart will never change
Round and around, you can't go down
Without a pound and an ounce of pain
Round and around, you can't go down
Without a pound and an ounce of pain
Round and around, you can't go down
Until your face don't match your name

Round and around, you can't go down
Without a pound and an ounce of pain
Round and around, you can't go down
Without a pound and an ounce of pain
I wake up, find again my shadow haunts me 'til the end
'Cause round and around, you can't go down
Without a pound and an ounce of pain
Round and around, you can't go down
Without a pound and an ounce of pain
'Cause round and around, you can't go down
Until your face don't match your name
