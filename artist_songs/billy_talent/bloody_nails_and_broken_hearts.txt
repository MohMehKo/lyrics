Lay down, lay down with your drunken fools,
I never thought you could be so cruel.
And all the rumours I heard were true,
You had another man in the room.
Peel off the bandages from the wound
I still have plenty of scars to prove.
I'm sick of coverin' up the truth,
So now I'm takin' it back from you.

From the start, drew a target on my heart,
So you can throw your poison darts.
You'll never kill, never kill.

You left a trail right from the start,
Of bloody nails and broken hearts.
And you keep tearin' them apart,
With bloody nails and broken hearts.

Yeah!

Now I know fairy tales don't come true,
And Cinderella don't fit the shoe.
Some day I'll get back the love I gave,
Some day you'll pay for the mess you've made.

From the start, drew a target on my heart,
So you can throw your poison darts.
You'll never kill, never kill, never kill.

You left a trail right from the start,
Of bloody nails and broken hearts.
And you keep tearin' them apart,
With bloody nails and broken hearts.

You left a trail right from the start,
Of bloody nails and broken hearts.
And I bet you thought I'd miss your bitter kiss.

Your bitter kiss, your bitter kiss,
I'll never miss your bitter kiss.
Your bitter kiss, your bitter kiss,
I'll never miss your bitter kiss.

So now I'm takin' it back from you,
(So now I'm takin' it back from you)
Yeah now I'm takin' it back from you.

You left a trail right from the start,
Of bloody nails and broken hearts.
And you keep tearin' them apart,
With bloody nails and broken hearts.

You left a trail right from the start,
Of bloody nails and broken hearts.
And I bet you thought I'd miss your bitter kiss.

Your bitter kiss, your bitter kiss
