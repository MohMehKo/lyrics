Put me on an aeroplane
A million miles away
She's opened up her book of hate
And tore a brand new page

Tonight I'll find a wishing well
Tomorrow's a new day
Tonight I'll find a wishing well before it's too late

Show me the way
Show me the way
Why do my dreams keep slipping away?
Show me the way
Show me the way
Spent a whole lifetime running away

She questioned my ability
To learn from my mistakes
I said she'd need a guillotine
To put me in my place

Tonight I'll write my eulogy
Before I fade away
Tonight I'll write my eulogy so don't be afraid

Show me the way
Show me the way
Why do my dreams keep slipping away?
Show me the way
Show me the way
Spent a whole lifetime running away

And every time I close my eyes, I've lost another day
Show me the way
Show me the way
Why do my dreams keep slipping away?

The waves came crashing down so fast
And when the storm was over the sky turned black
And now I pray for sunshine
I pray for sunshine
I pray you'll help me to escape

Show me the way
Show me the way
Why do my dreams keep slipping away?
Show me the way
Show me the way
Spent a whole lifetime running away

And every time I close my eyes, I've lost another day
Show me the way
Show me the way
Why do my dreams keep slipping away?

Every time we close our eyes, we've lost another day
Every time we close our eyes, our dreams will have to wait
