This heart don't count on the wicked
These hands don't fight at all
This mind don't do what it's told to
These eyes don't cry at all
Don't cry at all

These eyes don't cry at all

This heart don't count on the wicked
We face this world alone
When all they want is to break you
Turn anger into hope

We're in this city of villains
I walk these streets alone
When everyone is a stranger
Their eyes turn me to stone
Turn me to stone

Your eyes turn me to stone

This heart don't count on the wicked
We face this world alone
When all they want is to break you
Turn anger into hope

I'm telling you tonight I Swear to tear off these nails from the cross i bear
For giving you control of me

This heart don't count on the wicked
This anger turns to hope
It turns to hope

Calling from the mountain tops
Rain is falling from the sky above
They surround you with the darkest thoughts
'til you drown in pessimistic talk

You say you don't care if the atom drops
You say you don't care if the world is lost
They'll never break you if you're strong enough
They'll never change you if you turn your anger into hope

This heart don't count on the wicked
We face this world alone
When all they want is to break you
Turn anger into hope

I'm telling you tonight I swear to tear off these nails from the cross i bear
For giving you control of me

This heart don't count on the wicked
This anger turns to hope

We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
