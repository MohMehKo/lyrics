Brothers in arms that share my fears,
Time to protect what you hold dear.
There's been a rise in new ideas,
Threatening to change the way we live.

Who knows what trouble's found a way,
Found a way to your door today.
Who knows what trouble's on its way,
On its way to intimidate.

All I want is a big red gun
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh
I'm gonna shoot, shoot, shoot at the setting sun
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh
And all I want is a big red gun,
I'm gonna shoot, shoot, shoot till the thrill is gone
'Cause this is my right no matter the cost
Stay outta my sight when baby's got a big red gun
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh
Baby's got a big red gun
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh

Pride is a weapon in your hand.
Freedom awards the faithful man.
I hear the message loud and clear,
Straight from his lips into my ear.

And Lord I just can't walk away,
Walk away from the enemy.
The law will never disagree,
On the target of my insecurities.

All I want is a big red gun
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh
I'm gonna shoot, shoot, shoot at the setting sun
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh
And all I want is a big red gun,
I'm gonna shoot, shoot, shoot till the thrill is gone
And how many lives will have to be lost,
To understand why my baby's got a big red gun?

Baby's got a big red gun
Baby's got a big red gun
Baby's got a big red gun
Baby's got a big red gun

We call them twisted and deranged,
(Baby's got a big red gun)
But we gave them the keys to annihilate
(Baby's got a big red gun)
How long before the next one's in the crowd?
(Baby's got a big red gun)
So proud of all your history,
(Baby's got a big red gun)
But history made a big mistake.
(Baby's got a big red gun)
The judge and jury stand before you now.
(Baby's got a big red gun)

'Cause baby's got a big red gun
Baby's got a big red gun
Baby's got a big red gun
Oh mama what have I become?
