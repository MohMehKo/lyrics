(Respect!)
Is never given enough today
I'm tired of looking the other way
(Respect!)
An appetite that we can't sustain
We're on a mission to kiss our days away

So how long before the rivers start to rise, dear?
Yeah I thank my lucky stars to be alive here

(Respect!)
A generation of castaways
Under a nation of tidal waves
(Respect!)
Are we the passengers or the prey?
You can't escape from the past on this holiday

So how long before the rivers start to rise, dear?
Pack your bags because we're going for a ride

Don't be afraid of the view from economy class
It's just the captain and crew jumping off of the mast
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats
Who's gonna sound the alarm when the bridges collapse?
Is this the point where the bomb reaches critical mass?
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats

(Respect!)
Catastrophic events don't change
Today we feast, but tomorrow we pay
(Respect!)
But don't you worry cause you'll be safe
I got a ticket to piss your days away

So how long before the rivers start to rise, dear?
Pack your bags because the tide is getting high

Don't be afraid of the view from economy class
It's just the captain and crew jumping off of the mast
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats
Who's gonna sound the alarm when the bridges collapse?
Is this the point where the bomb reaches critical mass?
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats

Don't be afraid of the view from economy class
It's just the captain and crew jumping off of the mast
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats
Who's gonna sound the alarm when the bridges collapse?
Is this the point where the bomb reaches critical mass?
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats

We're sailing from the coast disappearing too fast
We're sailing from the coast sunk into the past
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats
We're sailing from the coast disappearing too fast
We're sailing from the coast, we can never come back
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats

Cannibal rats
