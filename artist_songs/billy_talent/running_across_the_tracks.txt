It's up to you!

This ain't no TV show,
You watch my head explode,
Ten thousand hours everyday.
No time to be afraid,
Chase out the rattle snakes,
Don't let your fear control your fate.

The ghost of self-denial,
It whispers from the grave,
The road you can't rely on,
The risk that you must take.

I'm runnnin' across the tracks,
(And I'll never go back)
Oh, I'm runnin' across the tracks,
(And I'll never go back)
I'm pullin' the blindfolds back,
On a dead end life,
I'm runnin' across the tracks
(And I'll never go back)
I'm runnin' across the tracks
(And I'll never go back)
I'm gonna escape this trap,
Gotta get out alive.

Stuck in this prison cell,
Just like a criminal,
I count the years that went to waste.
If this road goes to Hell,
I'll fight back when I fail
Made a career from my mistakes.

The ghost of self-denial,
It whispers from the grave,
The road you can't rely on,
Could be your saving grace.

I'm runnin' across the tracks,
(And I'll never go back)
Oh, I'm runnin' across the tracks,
(And I'll never go back)
I'm pullin' the blindfolds back,
On a dead end life,
I'm runnin' across the tracks
(And I'll never go back)
Oh, I'm runnin' across the tracks
(And I'll never go back)
I'm gonna escape this trap,
Gotta get out alive.

And every step that I aim to take
(I fall behind, I fall behind)
And every neck that I had to break
(These scars are mine, these scars are mine)
And everyday that I'd pray for you,
(I close my eyes, I close my eyes)
At least I can say that we made it through,
(The stars aligned, the stars aligned)

The stars aligned.
The stars aligned.

And words just can't explain the struggle of a dead man's fight,
A dead man's fight,
And silver spoons can't buy the wisdom of a hard earned life
A hard earned life.

Every step that I aim to take
(I fall behind, I fall behind)
And every neck that I had to break
(These scars are mine, these scars are mine)
And everyday that I pray for you,
(I close my eyes, I close my eyes)
And I hope that you make it through,
Yeah, I hope that you make it through

It's up to you!

I'm runnin' across the tracks,
(And I'll never go back)
I'm runnin' across the tracks,
(And I'll never go back)
I'm pullin' the blindfolds back,
On a dead end life,
I'm runnin' across the tracks
(And I'll never go back)
I'm runnin' across the tracks
(And I'll never go back)
I'm gonna escape this trap,
Gotta get out alive.

Every step that I aim to take
(I fall behind, I fall behind)
And every neck that I had to break
(These scars are mine, these scars are mine)
And everyday that I pray for you,
(I close my eyes, I close my eyes)
At least I can say that we made it through.
(The stars aligned, the stars aligned)
