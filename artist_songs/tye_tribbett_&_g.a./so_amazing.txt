I don't know what I would be
Had it not been for you
You are my everything
Your love is so amazing
When I was in my sin
You came and rescued me
I give you all of me
Your love is so amazing
[repeat]

Your amazing, Your amazing
Your amazing, So amazing
Your amazing, Your amazing
He's a mighty God
[repeat]

Yeah, Oh
