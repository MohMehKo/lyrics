Now He's seated at the right hand of God
He is our Savior
and His name is Jesus
The One who came and died and now He lives
Lion of Juda
oh Jesus
His face is shining as the morning sun
the Great Redeemer
His name is Jesus
His name is Jesus
The peace that's in His eyes dries every tear
The breath of life

He still has the nail prints in His hands and in His feet
His power can remove them but it stays for all to see
To remind us of the pain and agony that He endured on Calvary

Now He's seated at the right hand of God
He is our Savior
and His name is Jesus
His glory is the Light that fills the sky
The Son of God
oh Jesus
oooh I feel His presence blowing in the wind
He's all around me
and His name is Jesus
I'm amazed that He wants me near
I'm going closer
oh Jesus

He still has the nail prints in His hands and in His feet
His power can remove them but it stays for all to see
To remind us of the pain and agony that He endured on Calvary

Now He's, now He's 
seated at the right hand of God
He is our Savior 
and His name is Jesus
The peace and angels round the throne proclaim that He is mighty
Oh Jesus
He is the King who reigns victorious
He has all power
and His name is Jesus
oOoOoOh 
Who am I to serve a God like this
I bow right now
