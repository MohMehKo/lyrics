You try & you try to do everything your way
You're sick & you're stressed out tryin yo make it through the day
May I suggest one thing that just might help out
Cause trust me if you trust Christ he will change your life

Oh oh oh oh oh (oh my lord)
Taste 'n' see the lord is so good

Do you think you can handle the pressures of life on your own
Well I thought so too but I found out my answer was no
It wasn't til I tried the goodness of Jesus Christ for me
I want you to see for yourself just how good He can be

Oh oh oh oh oh (oh my lord)
Taste 'n' see the lord is so good

Blessed is the man that trust in him

Oh oh oh oh oh
Taste 'n' see the lord is so good
