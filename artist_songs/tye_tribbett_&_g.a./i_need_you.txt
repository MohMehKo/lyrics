Lord You are so amazing
(Lord You are so amazing)
Lord You are strong and mighty
(Lord You are strong and mighty)
Lord You are full of mercy
(Lord You are full of mercy)
Lord Your name above all others
(Lord Your name above all others)

And I cannot imagine
What my life would be without You
I know I would be hopeless
I'm a wretch undone without You

(That's why I)
Can't be without You
Won't last without You
I need You
I need You
(And I'm)
So lost without you
I know that I would fail alone
I need You
I need You

Lord You are so amazing
(Lord You are so amazing)
Lord You are a strong tower
(Lord You are a strong tower)
Lord You are pure and holy
(Lord You are pure and holy)
Lord You are the very air I breathe
(Lord You are the very air I breathe)

And I cannot imagine
What my life would be without You
I know I would be hopeless
I'm a wretch undone without You

(That's why I)
Can't be without You
Won't last without You
I need you
I need you
(And I'm)
So lost without You
I know that I would fail alone
I need You
I need You

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I need you
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I need you
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I need you

And I cannot imagine
What my life would be without You
