I thought that I would not survive
I came this close to losing my mind
Sometimes you go through things in life
That makes you say, "Lord why me this time? "

He's so faithful
He keeps making ways
Out of no way
Just when I thought that I could
Take no more
I made it through

So many nights I had to cry
So many storm clouds I lost sight
I felt like giving up the fight
Never thought I would see daylight

He's so faithful
He keeps making ways
Out of no way

He's so faithful
He's so faithful
He's so faithful
He's so faithful

He keeps making ways
Out of no way
He keeps making ways
Out of no way
He keeps making ways
Out of no way

Just when I thought that I could
Take no more
I made it

I made it through
I made it through
I made it through
I made it through
I made it through
I made it through

I made it
Made it [x4]

Made it
Through [x4]

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Still standing
I made it

Still Praising
I made it

Still dancing
I made it

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Still standing
I made it

Still clapping
I made it

Still dancing
I made it

Still dancing
I made it
