Forget about the cars, the bentleys with the rims
It's not about the clothes, the baggy jeans and timbs
Forget about the house, the mansion on the hill
With the swimming pool in the back and the barbecue on the grill
Forget about fortune, forget about the fame
See it's not about money or people screaming my name
I just love you, oh Lord I just love you for who you are
That's all, that's all
See, I'm not trying to be no superstar
That's not why I'm singing this song

Some people just love you for the things you've done
And some just love you for all the victories won
Now there's nothing wrong (nothing wrong) with that kind of praise (kind of praise)
But this time around, I love you is all I wanna say
I got one more verse, before I end this tune
See, I can go on and on like Erykah Badu
Cause I just love you, oh Lord I just love you for who you are
That's all, that's all
See, I'm not trying to be no superstar

Now if you never bless me with material things
(Like what?) Like the furs and the diamonds and the escalade or the rims
See you would still be God and that's enough for me to love you
Hey, I love you Lord
Cause I just love you, oh Lord I just love you for who you are
You mean more than this world to me
See, I'm not trying to be no superstar
That's not why I'm singing this song

I love you Lord and here's the reason why
You gave your life, you didn't have to die
Everytime I think about it I just cry
As I long as I live you'll be glorified
I know I don't pray just as much I should
I know I don't read just as much as I could
And if I ask you to forgive me Lord I know you would
Tryin' to end this song but you've been so good to me
I just love you, oh Lord I just love you for who you are
You mean more than this life to me
See, I'm not trying to be no superstar

You mean more than life to me, you're everything I need
You supply all of my needs
The list goes on and on
I just love you
I'm tryin' to end this song but you've been so good
All I can say is...

Na na na na naaa, na na na na naaaa
[repeat until end]
