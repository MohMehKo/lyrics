You have given us
A garden of praise for the spirit of heaviness
And you traded us
Joy for our pain so we praise you Jesus
[repeat]

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

You have given mercy
Everlasting love, no greater love
You have given us power over all evil
We are victorious

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
[repeat to end]
