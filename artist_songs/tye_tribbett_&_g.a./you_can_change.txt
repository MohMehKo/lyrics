You can change, if you want.
The change is right here and now, if you want.
[repeat]
There's no problem too hard that Jesus can't fix.
There's no habbit too strong that Jesus can't break.
[repeat]
I know you can change, if you want.
The change is right here and now, if you want.
You don't have to live that lie no more.
You don't have to drink that wine no more.
You don't have to smoke that weed no more.
You don't have to sell your body no more.
(Wasn't Jesus was you when he choose)yeah
(Didn't you have to choose)yeah
(What did you have to leave)nothing
(Didn't he turn your life around)yeah
(Can't he do it for somebody else right now)yeah
(Well tell them there is)
There is a better place [repeat]
