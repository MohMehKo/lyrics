[Verse 1:]
On that great day when he cracks the sky
When the world hears the trumpet sound And the dead begin to rise
I wonder how it would be
Will I be walking down the street
Will it happen right in the middle of the day
Or at night while I'm asleep

[Chorus]
All I know is I want to be ready
I want to be ready
And I want you to say well done
I just want you to say well done

[Verse 2:]
I can already see the signs
Each day the world is getting worse
It seems the world itself is crying out
For someone to rescue her
The days are getting shorter
The years are passing by
It's like I see the Lord preparing Himself to come and get His bride

[Chorus:]
All I know is I want to be ready
I want to be ready
And I want you to say well done
I just want you to say well done
[repeat]

[speaking: Tye]
Most of us have plans for this life
We have a blue print of our business and how we want our future to be
And it's good to have a vision and a plan for with out a vision the people perish so that's a great thing
But let's be mindful as we pursue our dreams
And as we pursue our goals
That at the end of all this
The reality is I'm living my whole life
Just to hear two words
And that's well done
Anybody with me
I'm living my whole life just to hear well done
That's all I wanna hear

(I wanna hear Enter)

Enter... into... My joy... servant... well done
Enter... into... My joy... servant... well done
Enter... into... My joy... servant... well done
Enter... into... My joy... servant... well done
[x2]

Well done
Well done
Faith-ful ser-vant, well done
[x2]
