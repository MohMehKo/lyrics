You were there to wrap your arms around me
When my nights were cold and lonely
And when I needed shelter from the rain
All I had to do was call your name
You never let me down you're always there
You told me all my burdens you will bear
Never truly understand your ways
But I understand you love me and for this I want to say

You are my joy
You are my joy

It's because if you I smile right in my storm
Your strength is perfect when I'm weak and worn
Thank you for the love you give to me
Thank you for your grace and mercy
When all of these trails should make me sad
I will rejoice for
You have made me glad

You are my joy You are my joy
You are my joy You are my joy
You are my joy You are my joy
