Though it was fun, thought I could
Do what I want, And I
Thought I was grown
And could make it on my own
I thought
No one really understands me
And even though I'm home I feel so alone
I thought
Do what you feel like doing
No one cares any way
Maybe then someone would notice you

Now how I ended up where I am
I don't know
I never planned on being here
The devil tempted me and I was drawn away
But I have no desire to stay, oh

Got to get out of here
I've got to get out of here
I wanna be with You

Can't believe what I got myself into
Thought I had everything under control
I didn't realize the whole time
That the enemy had plans to destroy my life
Father please won't You
Have mercy on me
Please forgive me and restore Your joy
I can't imagine staying here 'til I die
I gotta get back to Your side

The devil tempted me and I was drawn away
But I have no desire to stay, oh

Got to get out of here
I've got to get out of here
I wanna be with You

Got to get out of here
I've got to get out of here
I wanna be with You

Got to get out of here
I've got to get out of here
I wanna be with You

Got to get out of here
I've got to get out of here
I wanna be with You

Got to get out of here
I've got to get out of here
I wanna be with You
