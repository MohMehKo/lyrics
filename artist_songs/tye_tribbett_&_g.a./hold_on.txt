[Chorus:]
Every little things gonna be alright
Weeping can only last one night
You got to endure to the morning sun
You're gonna win the race but you have to run
Trouble can never last always
Looks like I can see a brighter day
My brother, if you c an just hold on
The Lord is gonna make a way I know
Every little things gonna be alright

[Verse 1:]
[Tye:] The God that we serve is Lord of all
[Thad:] Of big as well as the small
[Tye:] Yes, He's in love with everyone
[Thad:] No matter how many times we fall
[Tye:] Every detail that re-tells your life
[Thad:] He's already worked it out
[Tye:] I know that life gets rough sometimes
[Thad:] But trust and never doubt
[Tye:] Yes, He sees that sometimes you cry
[Thad:] In the room all by yourself
[Tye:] And when your kids need money just to bust a grub
[Thad:] He sees nobody is there to help
[Tye:] Even though sometimes you feel like giving up
[Thad:] And throwing in the towel... He brought you out many tiems before
[Tye:] Why should it be any different now?

{Every little things gonna be alright}

[Verse 2:]
[Tye:] I know it seems that the Lord forgot
[Thad:] About all that you're going through
[Tye:] The doctor said that there may be something wrong
[Thad:] On top of that all your bills are do
[Tye:] All the kids are growing up so bad
[Thad:] They think that they are grown
[Tye:] The job is talkin bout laying you off
[Thad:] You can't make it on your own
[Tye:] Well, allow me to take the time right now
[Thad:] To echo the words of Christ
[Tye:] Matthew 6 verse 25
[Thad:] Takes all note for your life(?)
[Tye:] So you may as run to the hills
[Thad:] Cuase your help is on the way... rejoice in the Lord and be glad
[Tye:] This is the day that the Lord has made

[Chorus:]
Every little things gonna be alight
Weeping can only last one night
You gotta endure to the morning sun
You're gonna win the race but you have to run
Trouble can never last always
Looks like I can see a brighter day
My brother, if you can just hold on
The Lords gonna make a way I know
Every little thing

Hold on!
