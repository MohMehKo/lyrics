When I think of the goodness of Jesus 
And all He has done for me 
My soul cries out Hallelujah 
Thank God for saving me 

[Hook:]
I was (sinking so deep in sin) 
And so (very deeply stained within) 
But God, Oh but God 
He's been good 

[Bridge:]
Everyday with Jesus 
Is sweeter than the day before 
Everyday with Jesus 
I love Him more and more 

[Hook:]
I was (sinking so deep in sin) 
And so (very deeply stained within) 
But God, Oh but God 
He's been good 

[Vamp:]
God's been so good to me 
Yes He's been good to me
