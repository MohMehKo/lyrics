[Verse 1:]
Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him 
Though He slay me, I'll trust in the Lord 
Though talked about and misunderstood 
Yes, I've been lied on, but still have my joy 

[Bridge 1:]
Weeping may endure for a night 
But I'm glad that I still have joy 

[Hook:]
After all that I've been through 
I still have my joy 

[Bridge 2:]
Oh, oh, oh 
This joy I have, the world didn't give it 
This joy I have, the world can't take it away 

[Hook:]
After all that I've been through 
I still have my joy 
I still have joyâ€¦still have joy
