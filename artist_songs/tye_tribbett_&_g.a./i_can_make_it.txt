Sometimes I feel that life's too hard for me to understand
I mean it's like everyday is something else it's just too much I'm just a man
When I ask for help it seems like no ones there to lend a helping hand
It kinda hurt when they say "I can't help you" when you know they ca
I can make
Everything I'm going through I know I know it's just a test
I've been lied on & talked about wich I had time to tell the rest
Even if I had time I couldn't tell you everythinh I've been through cause it's too much for me it's too much
My mind is going crazy
Gotta try to keep myself together gotta try to keep my mind off all the things that's hurting me so bad but it hurts
Lord you gotta help me
I know that I I can make
I can make it
