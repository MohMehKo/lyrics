[Verse 1:]
Everytime I wake up in the morning, 
God is there. 
In the sun or even if it's storming, 
God is there. 

Even in a crowd or if I'm all alone, 
He's still there, still there. 
There's no place, He'll let me go without Him, 
'cause He's everywhere, 
and I can't live without You.

[Chorus:]
I can't live,
I can't live without You.

I can't live,
I can't live without You.

I can't live,
I can't live without You.

I can't live,
I can't live.

[Verse 2:]
When I'm up, way up on the mountain, 
God is there. 
And yes, when I'm low, low, low,
way down in the valley, He's still there. 

I'm grateful for the love You give to me, 
You've always been there in my time of need, 
and I can't live without You.

[Chorus]

[Rap:]
Do you remember when 
your heart was in two, 
He was right there to hold you; 
are you grateful, 
come on, are you grateful? 

Well, I remember when 
my bills were too late, 
and somehow God made a way; 
I'm grateful, He didn't have to do it, 
but I'm grateful, He didn't have to do it. 

[Bridge:]
I'm grateful for the love You give to me, 
You've always been there in my time of need, 
and I can't live without You.

[Chorus]

[Vamp:]
I can't eat, I can't sleep, 
I can't move, I can't breathe.

I can't walk, I can't talk, 
I can't think, I'm too weak.
