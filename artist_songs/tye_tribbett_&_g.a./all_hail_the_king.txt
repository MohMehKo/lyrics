The Lord of Hosts
He's strong and mighty in Battle
He's in control
There's nothing He can't handle
Just by His presence alone
Everything not like Him got to move
For He is holy
Exalted and He's worthy
Great is the Lord
And His glory is far above the heavens
I fear and tremble
For the Lord is terrible and all powerful
The wicked melt
The darkness fades away
For the Lord is great and He's worthy to be praised

(All Hail the King of Glory
All Hail the King of Glory)

All Hail the King of Glory
All Hail the King

All Hail the King of Glory
All Hail the King of Glory
All Hail the King
The King of Glory

No one is greater
Greater than the King
He's Alpha and Omega
And everything between
A very present help
In the time of trouble
He's my refuge and my fortress I will trust
Now let his people
In all the earth
Respect His presence
Give Him praise and give Him worship
The King is here
And He reigns in majesty
He gets all the glory
He alone is worthy

(All Hail the King of Glory
All Hail the King of Glory)

All Hail the King of Glory
All Hail the King

All Hail the King of Glory
All Hail the King of Glory
All Hail the King

The King of Glory

The King of Glory

Hallelujah, All hail
The King of Glory

The King of Glory [x8]
