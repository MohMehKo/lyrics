[Verse 1:]
Sometimes you hate waking up in the morning 
You feel like nothing's changed since the night before 
You see the same bills sitting there on the table 
And no doubt the same food in the refrigerator 
You say to yourself there's nothing in-store for this day 
So what's the use of me waking up anyway 

[Chorus:]
But hold your head up high, God is on your side 
Just dry your eyes and know God's made a way 
Be encouraged 
Everything will be alright 

[Verse 2:]
So you finally get up and say I'll just ignore what I feel 
So you get dressed, walk out the house, but you forgot 
There's a boot on your wheel 
Ladies and Gentlemen I understand what you feel when life gets like that 
'Cause I've been there to and let me tell you, there ain't no pain that hurts like that 
But you've got to remember though your life seems unfair 
That He won't put more on you than you can bear 

[Chorus:]
But hold your head up high, God is on your side 
Just dry your eyes and know God's made a way 
Be encouraged 
Everything will be alright 

[Vamp:]
Alright, it will be alright 
Alright, alright, alright
