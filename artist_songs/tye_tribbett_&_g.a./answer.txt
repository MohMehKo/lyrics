This song is for those who feel alone
And for those who can't seem to find no love
Only those who stay awake at night and just cry
Some of you just want to run away & just hide

There is an answer for you
This song is for you

Maybe you've been very badly hurt
Some of you have been bruised right in the church
Oh oh oh remember not to put your trust in man
Oh oh oh only God alone will understand
What you going thru going thru

God cares he cares
God cares he cares
God cares he cares
Good loves you & you're never alone with his love yeah
He loves you & you don't have you cry with his love
God loves you & you don't have to hurt with his love yeah
He loves you & you don't have to hide with his love
God loves you you have a reason to live now
He loves you now you can throw all those pills out

There is an answer for you
There is an answer for you
There is an answer for you
There is an answer for you
There is an answer for you
Jesus cares for you
