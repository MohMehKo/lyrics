I thought I lost, but actually I won
For by His blood we all have overcome
There is no failure, our God can never loose
And that same power, it now belongs to You

Now it's time to celebrate all banners raised
(I've got the Victory, the Victory)
Because the devil is defeated and God be praised
(I've got the Victory, the Victory)
Every situation I face, I win
(I've got the Victory, the Victory)
And everything works for my good in the end
(I've got the Victory, the Victory)

I was on my way to a burning hell
The devil, he had my life set up to fail
But thanks be to my God who causes me
To triumph, overcome, tread upon the enemy

Now it's time to celebrate all banners raised
(I've got the Victory, the Victory)
Because the devil is defeated and God be praised
(I've got the Victory, the Victory)
Every situation I face, I win
(I've got the Victory, the Victory)
And everything works for my good in the end
(I've got the Victory, the Victory)

Somebody who's listening right now You think You're losing
You feel like You can't win cause You tried everything
Greater is He that is within You don't doubt
Cause whatever You're in now, God says
You have to come out

Now it's time to celebrate all banners raised
(I've got the Victory, the Victory)
Because the devil is defeated and God be praised
(I've got the Victory, the Victory)
Every situation I face, I win
(I've got the Victory, the Victory)
And everything works for my good in the end
(I've got the Victory, the Victory)
