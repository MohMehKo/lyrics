No, it's not easy trying to live in this crazy world
No, No, it's not getting any better, only getting worst
No, I can't take it, I can't bear it by myself
No, No I can't make it without you, Lord I need your help!

It's a struggle cause I wanna please you gotta bow my head gotta bend my knees too. Help me I don't know what else to do

[Chorus:]
I slip and stumble sometimes, it's a struggle sometimes, but please Lord help me to stay true, I feel alone at times, can't stand the storm at time, But Please Lord Help me to stay true.
Now I am depending on you.

[Fellas:]
Now, it's so easy, to make my money the wrong way, and have all the girls say Hey! But I ain't trying to go that way, so everyday I pray, Lord keep me so I won't loose sight, the devil always putting up a fight, cause he knows that I am trying to live right.

[Ladies:]
Now it's so easy, to dress up and I look real nice, and act like everything is fine, and go back home and just cry, Oh Lord I am hurting, I need your strenght and your might, I am sick of the devil trying fight, I ain't got no business crying every night.

It's a struggle cause I wanna please you gotta bow my head gotta bend my knees too. Help me cause I don't know what else to do.

[Chorus:]
I slip and stumble sometimes, it's a struggle sometimes, but please Lord help me to stay true, I feel alone at times, can't stand the storm at time, But Please Lord Help me to stay true. Now I am depending on you.

[Vamp:]
Glad that I got help, Not in this life myself
