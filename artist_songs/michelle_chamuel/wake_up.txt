Sleep inside your world, wrapped up in your bed
Replayed fantasies curled up in your head
Keep it at a distance and it’s always out of reach
There’s nowhere you can get to when you’re walking in your sleep
So when you’re ready

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up,
You can’t have what you want if you don’t know what you need
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up,
Cause you don’t have what you got if all you got is a dream

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up,
You can’t have what you want if you don’t know what you need
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up,
Cause you don’t have what you got if all you got is a dream

Watched it come and go, lucid and so real
Both your eyes are closed, but it looks so real
Now the sun is rising so that you can start to see
There’s nowhere you can get to when you’re walking in your sleep
So when you’re ready

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up,
You can’t have what you want if you don’t know what you need
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up,
Cause you don’t have what you got if all you got is a dream

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up,
You can’t have what you want if you don’t know what you need
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up,
Cause you don’t have what you got if all you got is a dream

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up,
You can’t have what you want if you don’t know what you need
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up,
Cause you don’t have what you got if all you got is a dream

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up,
You can’t have what you want if you don’t know what you need
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up,
Cause you don’t have what you got if all you got is a dream
