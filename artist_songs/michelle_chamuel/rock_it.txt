You can wear stilettos at the café
You can hit the library on your birthday
You can do pilates on the subway
You can crank your heavy metal while you crochet

Cause no one knows what it’s like to walk in your shoes, in your shoes
Your colors show and it’s really nice to see you
Do what you do, say what you say
You got to rock it your own way, own way
Give what you give, day after day
You got to rock it your own way, own way

You can do karate on your first date
You can dip in the Jacuzzi in your roller skates
Rock out to this song when no one else sees
Order half a million people on the TV

Cause no one knows what it’s like to walk in your shoes, in your shoes
Your colors show and it’s really nice to see you
Do what you do, say what you say
You got to rock it your own way, own way
Give what you give, day after day
You got to rock it your own way, own way

Why would you do it any other way?
There’s no one else that’s built like you

Everybody wants to be down with the way they want to get down
Don’t be afraid, just rock it your own way
Everybody wants to get down, go ahead and put your feet down
Don’t be afraid, just rock it your own way

Cause no one knows what it’s like to walk in your shoes, in your shoes
Your colors show and it’s really nice to see you
Do what you do, say what you say
You got to rock it your own way, own way
Give what you give, day after day
You got to rock it your own way, own way

Everybody wants to be down with the way they want to get down
Don’t be afraid, just rock it your own way
Everybody wants to get down, go ahead and put your feet down
Don’t be afraid, just rock it your own way
