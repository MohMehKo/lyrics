Always wanted to believe someone out there was for me -
I couldn't seem to find you.
At the time you were to me, just a story, just a dream -
I was far away from you.

Scared that I was wasting my time,
but now I put it all on the line.

And I wouldn't change it,
my whole life I've been chasing.
This moment been waiting for someone made for me.
I've seen your face in so many different places,
I feel like it's fated, that you were made for me.

For a time I went around with my heart held underground,
trying to forget you.
I still wanted to believe someone out there was for me,
just couldn't seem to get through.

But now I think I've found something good,
and all that time I misunderstood...

Yet I wouldn't change it,
my whole life I've been chasing.
This moment been waiting for someone made for me.
I've seen your face in so many different places,
I feel like it's fated, that you were made for me.
