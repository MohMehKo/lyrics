Stay awake
And look into my eyes
We're running on faith
There's nothing left to hide
Stay with me
And listen to the sound
We're running out faith
Our feet against the ground

And we'll be golden
If I can make you see
That we'll be golden
If I can keep you holding onto me

Stay awake
And open up your eyes
It's never been safe
We're changing all the time
Stay with me
Remember what we've found
We've only got faith
We've only got now

[x2:]
And we'll be golden
If I can make you see
That we'll be golden
If I can keep you holding onto me

Oh ooh ooh, oh ooh ooh
If I can keep you holding onto me
Oh ooh ooh, oh ooh ooh
If I can keep you holding onto me
Oh ooh ooh, oh ooh ooh
Holding onto me
Oh ooh ooh, oh ooh ooh
Holding on

And we'll be golden
And we'll be golden
And we'll be golden
If I can make you see
That we'll be golden
If I can keep you holding onto me
