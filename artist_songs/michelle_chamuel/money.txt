When we started you were always down
Down to go out, down to go out
Never seemed to want to stay at home with me
Out to dinner and you’d always be
Checking your phone, checking your phone
How come you’re never checking up on me

You say you’re busy till it’s my turn to pay
Lean in to kiss you and you just look away
There is a pattern that I’m starting to see

You don’t want my love, you don’t want my love
You just want my money
You don’t want my love, you just want my money [x2]

Asked you out to my favorite show
Said you can’t go, said you can’t go
So I went ahead and got myself a seat
Then I tell you that I’m VIP
Now you can go, now you can go
Till you find out that you can’t get in for free

You say you’re busy till it’s my turn to pay
Lean in to kiss you and you just look away
There is a pattern that I’m starting to see

You don’t want my love, you don’t want my love
You just want my money
You don’t want my love, you just want my money [x2]

Thought it would be enough, to give you all my love
Then you would see that I was worth your time and
You’d give it back to me, but now it’s plain to see
That you don’t want my love, and you never did
You don’t want my love, you don’t want my love

You don’t want my love, you don’t want my love
You just want my money
You don’t want my love, you just want my money [x2]
