Stiff lip, tongue twist, I don’t know what to say
Hot blood, tight fist, how do I play the game?
Don’t know how much more of this I can take
Before it breaks me down

If I tried to be something better
I could never stand the pressure
Guessing what you wanted me to be
And now I see

All I can give you is me
I’m not pretending
You only get what you see
All I can give you is me

Heart race, quick blush, don’t want to let it show
Soft skin, head rush, how do I let you know?
Cold feet, backspace, I’ve got to let it go
Before it breaks me down

If I tried to be something better
I could never stand the pressure
Guessing what you wanted me to be
And now I see

All I can give you is me
I’m not pretending
You only get what you see
All I can give you is me

[x4]
No more time spent being little
No more living in my head
No more searching for the middle
When I just can be the end

All I can give you is me [x4]
