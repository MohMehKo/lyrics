I know you think that love is just a game for fools
Nobody plays it right, nobody knows the rules
Maybe you'll be just fine watching the numbers spin
Too scared to place a bet on the big win

Let's not make it harder than it has to be
I'll take a chance on you, you'll take a chance on me
And we both playing the lottery
And we both playing the lottery
We'll find out if it's meant to be
If we both playing the lottery

Maybe you think you're done, don't wanna try again
I know you lost it all, now you're wandering
Once there a different way, you could've rolled the dice
I think it's hard to say when you think twice

Let's not make it harder than it has to be
I'll take a chance on you, you'll take a chance on me
And we both playing the lottery
And we both playing the lottery
We'll find out if it's meant to be
If we both playing the lottery

Oh oh ooh yeah yeah
Take a chance with me
Oh oh ooh yeah yeah
Oh, and we'll see
Oh oh ooh yeah yeah
If we both playing the lottery

I know how bad it hurts to be hot and burn
And feel torn apart
Time and time again, know it's not the end
But don't know where to start

So let's not make it harder than it has to be
I'll take a chance on you, you'll take a chance on me
There's no other place that I would rather be
Take it a chance on you, take it a chance on me
And we both playing the lottery
And we both playing the lottery (oh yeah)
We'll find out if it's meant to be
If we both playing the lottery

Just take a chance, a chance with me
Oh, and we'll see
If we both playing the lottery
We'll find out if it's meant to be
