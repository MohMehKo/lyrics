How did we get here?
It all happened so fast
I didn't know we were movin'
Or see the point we have passed
Said "Darling, do you remember
When enough was enough?"
Tell me how did we get here?
When did we lose the love?

[Chorus:]
Can't take my new if you wanted to
You can't take back the things that you say
Oh, how we change just a little bit every day
Can't push away what you've got to face
So now we watch as we're slipping away
Oh, how we change just a little bit every day

How did we get here?
Is it really the end?
I didn't know we were movin'
It's like we only began
And now all I remember
Is getting caught in the rush
So, tell me how did we get here?
When did we lose the love?

[Chorus]

When did we lose the love?
When did we lose the love?
When did we lose the love, love, love?
When did we lose the love, love, love?
When did we lose the love, love, love?
When did we lose the love, love, love?

[Chorus]

When did we lose the love?
When did we lose the love?
When did we lose the love?
