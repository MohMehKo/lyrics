(Go down [6x]
Go down singing)

I see everybody staring
At you and the clothes that you're wearing
It seems like nothing's ever good enough
(Enough, enough, enough)
(Singing)

I heard everybody saying
That you are never gonna fit in
It feels like you're never good enough
(Enough, enough, enough)
(Singing)

When you're lost and can't be found
Just lift your head and stand your ground
It's always dark before the dawn
So raise your voice and sing this song (song, song)

You can tell me what's right
You can say that I'm wrong
You can tell me I'm weak
So you can think that you're strong

But you can't take my soul
Or the gifts I've been given
I'mma go down, go down
Go down singing

You can build yourself up
When you're putting me down
You can think you're a king
'Cause you've taken my crown

But you can't stop the fight
For the life that I'm living
I'mma go down, go down
Go down singing

I know just how you're feeling
Locked up, inside you're screaming
It's like no one ever hears a sound
(Sound, sound, sound)
(Singing)

I've been hurt in the same way
But trust, tomorrow is a new day
You've got everything you need inside
(Inside, inside, inside)
(Singing)

When you're lost and can't be found
Just lift your head and stand your ground
In the dark before the dawn
We raise our voice and sing this song (song, song)

You can tell me what's right
You can say that I'm wrong
You can tell me I'm weak
So you can think that you're strong

But you can't take my soul
Or the gifts I've been given
I'mma go down, go down
Go down singing

You can build yourself up
When you're putting me down
You can think you're a king
'Cause you've taken my crown

But you can't stop the fight
For the life that I'm living
I'mma go down, go down
Go down singing

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (singing)
Yeah, yeah
I'mma go down, go down
Go down singing

Eyes on me, wait and see
They don't know what's about to begin
Standing proud, face the crowd
All I know is how bright I'm shining

I'll be free, lose or win
I'm gonna go down singing

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, singing
(Go down singing)
Yeah, yeah, I'mma go down, go down, go down singing
(Oh, no, can you hear it?)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, singing
(I'm singing, I'm singing, whoa)
Yeah, yeah, I'mma go down, go down, go down singing
(Singing, I'm singing)

(Singing [8x])

When you're lost and can't be found
Just raise your voice and sing this song
