I wish that I, I could hold
All the answers now
I wonder if I, I let go
Will the sky fall down?
I wake up, and hear the wall breaking apart
Cause no one can hold it up

When the weight falls, slipping away from me
When the weight falls, pinning me down

Speeding up, standing ground
Till I lose control
Wonder if I, if I hold on
Will I turn to stone?
I wake up, and hear the wall breaking apart
Cause no one can hold it up

When the weight falls, slipping away from me
When the weight falls, pinning me down
When the weight falls, slipping away from me
When the weight falls, pinning me down

When the weight falls, slipping away from me
When the weight falls, pinning me down
