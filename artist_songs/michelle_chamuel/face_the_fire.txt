I feel it burning inside of me
Pulling me closer, pulling me closer
Some say it’s passion, some say it’s greed
Pulling me closer (closer)
I’m on a path, I know where it leads
Pulling me closer, pulling me closer
I see the flame, I feel the heat

Turn it up, turn it up and say it loud
I’m gonna face the fire, I’m gonna face the fire
Turn it up, turn it up and say it now
I’m gonna face the fire, I’m gonna face the fire
And watch it burn

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

A monster was sleeping, but now it’s awake
Pulling me closer, pulling me closer
I know what it gives and I know what it takes
Pulling me closer (closer)
Call it ambition or call it insane
Pulling me closer, pulling me closer
Call it a daemon, I call it my flame

Turn it up, turn it up and say it loud
I’m gonna face the fire, I’m gonna face the fire
Turn it up, turn it up and say it now
I’m gonna face the fire, I’m gonna face the fire
And watch it burn

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Pulling me closer, pulling me closer
Pulling me closer, pulling me closer
I’m on a path, I know where it leads
Pulling me closer, pulling me closer
I see the flame, I feel the heat
And watch it burn
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And watch it burn
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And watch it burn (Just turn it up)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Just turn it up)
And watch it burn (I’m gonna face it)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Just face it)
Say it with me now

Turn it up, turn it up and say it loud
I’m gonna face the fire, I’m gonna face the fire
Turn it up, turn it up and say it now
I’m gonna face the fire, I’m gonna face the fire
And watch it burn

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
