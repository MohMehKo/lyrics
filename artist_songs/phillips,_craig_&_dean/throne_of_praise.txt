What a savior
Light of heaven on His face
Radiating grace
Our redeemer
Arms of mercy open wide
A love we can't deny

We build You a throne of praise
Let our worship raise You high
All our crowns layed at Your feet
As an offering
We cry
We cry
Holy!

What a healer
Hope of glory in His stars
Rescuing our hearts
Our great shepherd
Voice like thunder calling out
Here your people shout

We build You a throne of praise
Let our worship raise You high
All our crowns layed at Your feet
As an offering
We cry
We cry
Holy!
Holy!
Holy!
Holy!
Holy!
Holy!

We build You a throne of praise
Let our worship raise You high

As an offering
