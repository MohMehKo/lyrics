I still have the message from the last time that you called
I wish I hadn't been so busy, we could have talked about it all
And when there's no one else around, I sit and listen to the sound of your voice

Well you always had a way of saying what I need to hear
Some how you'd make that heavy on my shoulders disappear
And I'm trying to carry through, in a world without you and it ain't easy, no

They say there's a cloud of witnesses cheering every body on
And in that choir of angels I know you're the loudest one
Shouting "Keep your eyes on Jesus and whatever you do, don't you dare give up the fight"
Yeah these days that what I hear when I hear voices, from the other side.

Seems like I'm at a cross roads almost every other day
And standing there I find myself wondering what you'd say
When I'm tempted just to quit, feel like giving in, I remember, yes

They say there's a cloud of witnesses cheering every body on
And in that choir of angels I know you're the loudest one
Shouting "Keep your eyes on Jesus and whatever you do, don't you dare give up the fight"
Yeah these days that what I hear when I hear voices, from the other side.

And when I close my eyes, I can see you standing with the angels and the Saints I can hear you telling me, "Whoa, well you just wait.
Cause there really is a heaven and it's paved with streets of gold and there really is a Savior and he's really on the thrown and there's no more separation, no more sorrow, no more pain, and there ain't a single tear in sight and some day we'll be together just rejoicin."
Yeah these days that's what I hear when I hear voices from the other side
