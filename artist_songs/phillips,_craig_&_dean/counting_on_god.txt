I'm in a fight not physical
I'm in a war but not of this world
You are the light that's beautiful
I want more I want all that's Yours

[Chorus:]
Joy unspeakable that won't go away
Just enough strength to live for the day
So I never have to worry what tomorrow will bring
'Cause my faith's on solid rock and I'm counting on God
I am counting on I am counting on God
I am counting on I am counting on God
I am counting on I am counting on God
I am counting on I am counting on God

I'm in a fight not physical
I'm in a war but not of this world
You are the light that's beautiful
I want more I want all that's Yours

[Chorus:]
Joy unspeakable that won't go away
Just enough strength to live for the day
So I never have to worry what tomorrow will bring
'Cause my faith's on solid rock and I'm counting on God
I am counting on I am counting on God
I am counting on I am counting on God
I am counting on I am counting on God
I am counting on I am counting on God

The miracle of Christ is in me
The mystery that sets me free
I'm nothing like I used to be
Just open up your eyes
You'll see

[Chorus:]
Joy unspeakable that won't go away
Just enough strength to live for the day
So I never have to worry what tomorrow will bring
'Cause my faith's on solid rock and I'm counting on God
I am counting on I am counting on God
I am counting on I am counting on God
I am counting on I am counting on God
I am counting on I am counting on God

[Chorus:]
Joy unspeakable that won't go away
Just enough strength to live for the day
So I never have to worry what tomorrow will bring
'Cause my faith's on solid rock and I'm counting on God
I am counting on I am counting on God
I am counting on I am counting on God
I am counting on I am counting on God
I am counting on I am counting on God

[Chorus:]
Joy unspeakable that won't go away
Just enough strength to live for the day
So I never have to worry what tomorrow will bring
'Cause my faith's on solid rock and I'm counting on God
I am counting on I am counting on God
I am counting on I am counting on God
I am counting on I am counting on God
I am counting on I am counting on God
