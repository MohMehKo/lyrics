I want to be close, close to Your side
So Heaven is real and death is a lie
I want to hear voices of angels above
Singing as one

[Chorus:]
Hallelujah, holy, holy
God Almighty, the great I AM
Who is worthy, none beside Thee
God Almighty, the great I AM

I want to be near, near to Your heart
Loving the world and hating the dark
I want to see dry bones living again
Singing as one

[Chorus]

The great I AM

The mountains shake before You the demons run and flee
At the mention of the name King of Majesty
There is no power in hell
Or any who can stand
Before the power and the presence of the great I AM

The great I AM the great I AM yeah

[Chorus x2]

The great I AM
The great I AM
The great I AM
