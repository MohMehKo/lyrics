[Verse 1]
I come broken
I come weary
But You give me rest
I come waiting
I come needing
But in You I trust
Cause There's never been a mountain that You can't move
There's never been a battle He could lose

[Chorus]
Only God of hope would ever say
When we put our faith in the one who says
Mountains move, Giants lose
Dead men walk out of empty tombs
We lift our eyes to the King of Kings
He's is willing to fight over everything
It's so clear, There's no fear
There's no fear cause our God is here
There's no fear cause our God is here
There's no fear cause our God is here

[Verse 2]
We come hopen
We come knowing
Your on our Side
Oooh
Protected
Our defender
You want this fight
There's never been a giant standing down
There's never been a cross that kept You down

[Chorus]
Only God of hope would ever say
When we put our faith in the one who says
Mountains move, Giants lose
Dead men walk out of empty tombs
We lift our eyes to the King of Kings
He's is willing to fight over everything
It's so clear, There's no fear
There's no fear cause our God is here
There's no fear cause our God is here
There's no fear cause our God is here
Yea
Whoa

[Bridge]
The Lord is my rock
My salvation I won't fee
The Lord is my refuge and my shield 
He's right here [x2]

[Chorus]
Only God of hope would ever say
When we put our faith in the one who says
Mountains move, Giants lose
Dead men walk out of empty tombs
We lift our eyes to the King of Kings
He's is willing to fight over everything
It's so clear, There's no fear
There's no fear cause our God is here
There's no fear cause our God is here
There's no fear cause our God is here
There's no fear cause our God is here
There's no fear cause our God is here
