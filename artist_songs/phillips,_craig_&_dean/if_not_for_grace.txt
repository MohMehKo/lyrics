Standing out before the Lord
How could I fail to see?
If there is good in what I've done?
It's in spite of me
Any trophies I have won
All that earns me praise
I give as an offering
I lay it at your feet

And I bow once again beneath the cross

If not for grace I would be lost
I earn the nails
I am the cross
His blood redeemed
Love took my place
Where would I be? Where would I be?
If not for grace
If not for grace
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

If I boast in anything
Let it be Christ alone
Only He deserves applause
All to Him I owe
And if I gain the praise of man
I'll count it all as loss
For the sake of knowing Him
As savior and my God

And I bow once again beneath the cross

If not for grace I would be lost
I earn the nails
I am the cross
His blood redeemed
Love took my place
Where would I be? Where would I be?
If not for grace
If not for grace
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Can't take credit for what I'll become
Won't forget its grace that helps me love
Not my strength that sees the battles won
(Not my strength that sees the battles won)
I will glory, glory in the house

If not for grace I would be lost
I earn the nails
I am the cross
His blood redeemed
(His blood redeemed)
Love took my place
(Love took my place)
Where would I be? Where would I be?
If not for grace
(If not for grace)
If not for grace
(If not for grace)
If not for grace
(If not for grace)
If not for grace
