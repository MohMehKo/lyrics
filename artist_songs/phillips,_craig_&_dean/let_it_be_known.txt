Come on let's turn it up
We're going to sing it out
For all the world to hear
Oh, oh, o-o-oh
There's life for everyone
A new day has begun
Something to shout about

Let it be known
Our God saves
Our God reigns
We lift You up, up
Let it be known
Love has come
Love has won
We lift You up, up, up
Oh oh

Nothin' can stop us now
No one can keep us down
We've found our voice again
Oh, oh, o-o-oh
No need for fear and shame
There's power in His name
Come on let freedom reign

Let it be known
Our God saves
Our God reigns
We lift You up, up
Let it be known
Love has come
Love has won
We lift You up, up, up
Oh oh

We lift Your name up
Higher and higher
We lift Your name up
We shout Your name out
Louder and louder
We shout it out now

We lift Your name up
Higher and higher
We lift Your name up
Jesus
We shout Your name out
Louder and louder
We shout it out now

Let it be known
That our God saves
Our God reigns
We lift You up, up
Let it be known
Love has come
Love has won
We lift You up, up

Let it be known
Our God saves
Our God reigns
We lift You up, up
Let it be known
Love has come
Love has won
We lift You up, up, up

We lift Your name up
Higher and higher
We lift Your name up
We shout Your name out
Louder and louder
We shout it out now

We lift Your name up
Higher and higher
We lift Your name up
We shout Your name out
Louder and louder
We shout it out now

We lift Your name up
Higher and higher
We lift Your name up
We shout Your name out
Louder and louder
We shout it out now
