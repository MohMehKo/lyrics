There is a freedom in prison
There is a light in the dark
That will swallow the shadows
And carry the night from our hearts

There is a peace in the chaos
There is a grace for the flame
A strength for the battle
A shield for the arrow
A faith that endures everything

Our hope
Our hope has a name
Jesus
Jesus is with us

There is a glory in suffering
That leads to the altar of rest
There's a beauty from ashes
And there is a victory in death

'Cause there is the lamb resurrected
There is a tomb left in shame
When all of our sin
Was left there within
The day our hope rose from the grave

Our hope
Our hope has a name
Jesus
Jesus is with us

Our hope
Our hope has a name
Jesus
Jesus is with us

He is the hope for the patient who wait
He is the hope for the sinner and saint
He is the hope at the end of the day
He's the hope who's never late
He's the hope who's never late

Our hope
Our hope has a name
Jesus
You're with us

Our hope
Our hope has a name
Jesus
You're with us

Hope has a name
Joy has a name
Peace has a name
Love has a name
Jesus
You're with us
