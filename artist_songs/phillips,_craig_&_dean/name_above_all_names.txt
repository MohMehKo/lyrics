There is a name with power to save
That will never end
There is a love that conquered the grave
That brings new life again

A song is rising, all creation sings

King of Glory, Lord Creator
Worthy of our everlasting praise
Great Redeemer, beautiful Savior
Jesus, the name above all names
The name above all names

No other name could ever bring hope
To the broken heart
Nothing compares or even comes close
To how wonderful You are

A song is rising, forever we will sing

King of Glory, Lord Creator
Worthy of our everlasting praise
Great Redeemer, beautiful Savior
Jesus, the name above all names

You're a never ending
Everlasting King
There is no other name
So let Your praises ring

King of Glory, Lord Creator
Worthy of our everlasting praise
Great Redeemer, beautiful Savior
Jesus, the name above all names
Name above, name above all names

Worthy of our everlasting praise
Great Redeemer, beautiful Savior
Jesus, the name above all names

Worthy of, worthy of our everlasting praise
Worthy of, worthy of our everlasting praise
