Broken up on a road that felt like freedom
A rebel headed anywhere but home
Adam’s fall repeated in a moment
Kept it at the edge of Eden’s door

In the company of the angels
Reachin’ from a beautiful world
You could’ve waited

[CHORUS:]
You couldn’t stand
Couldn’t stand the distance
You wouldn’t bare the silence anymore
Love broke the fall, bridged across to reach us
You opened Heaven’s door
‘Cause you couldn’t stand the distance

Close enough to see the love I needed
A seeker lookin’ for the way back home
Underneath the weight of what I wasted
While mercy stood lookin’ down on hope

Then you ran to where I was waiting
And your love crossed the canyon between us
You came to save me

[CHORUS]

So close to your mercy
Yet so far away
You ran to me 
You ran to me
Forgiveness
Embrace me
You call me by name
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[CHORUS (x2)]
