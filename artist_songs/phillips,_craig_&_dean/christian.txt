Some talk about virtue
Some preach about vice
Some say the road to heaven is paved with thin ice
Some people keep sinning
They don't think about it twice
Still some have been born again and bound for paradise

So many are called
So few want to come
Backs up against the wall and still choose to run

But I'm proud that I'm a Christian
I'll say it loud that I'm a Christian
There ain't no doubt that I'm a Christian
I am so proud of it
Lord, I'm so proud of it

You can read it in the paper
Or watch the evening news
Surveys say the planet's
got those spiritual blues
Some people you meet
Think their soul is in their shoes
Care not to be complete
Their minds content to be confused

No hope in their heart
No love in their eyes
They reject His promises
and waste their lives

But I'm proud that I'm a Christian
I'll say it loud that I'm a Christian
There ain't no doubt that I'm a Christian
I am so proud of it
Lord, I'm so proud of it

Some talk about religion
Some preach about sin
Some assume denominations
are the way to get in
Don't think your brother has to
have the same skin
Just believe that Jesus came
to save all men
Say it once again

And be proud to be a Christian
Say it loud to be a Christian
Have no doubt and be a Christian
Say it loud
I'm saved and I'm proud
