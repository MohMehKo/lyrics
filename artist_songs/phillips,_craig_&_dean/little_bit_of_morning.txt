You can't believe that a night could be
So long and cold
A buried dream, a goal unreached
You've lost your hope

And your will to try is covered by
A full eclipse of the heart
Though your faith is low, still the embers glow
Dreams can live from one small spark

There's a little bit of morning outside
There's a new beginning in the sky
It's been awhile, but now the time is right
To spread your wings and fly

Silent heart, sing a brand new song
The darkest night is just before the dawn
Weary soul arise, wipe the pain from your eyes
There's a little bit of morning outside

The hope He brought seemed all but lost
When they laid Him in the tomb
The dreams, the plans, the healing hands
Wrapped in death and gloom

But early Sunday morn the promise was reborn
At the breaking of the day
He was alive and well, he conquered death and hell
Because He lives now we can say

There's a little bit of morning outside
There's a new beginning in the sky
It's been awhile, but now the time is right
To spread your wings and fly

Silent heart, sing a brand new song
The darkest night is just before the dawn
Weary soul arise, wipe the pain from your eyes
There's a little bit of morning outside, oh yeah

Though the darkness for a moment
May hide tomorrow's light
Just beyond what eye's can see
The light of hope is bright

There's a little bit of morning outside
There's a new beginning in the sky
It's been awhile, but now the time is right
To spread your wings and fly

Silent heart, sing a brand new song
The darkest night is just before the dawn
Weary soul arise, wipe the pain from your eyes
There's a little bit of morning outside, yes it is
Weary soul arise, wipe the pain from your eyes
There's a little bit of morning outside

Weary soul arise, wipe the pain from your eyes
There's a little bit of morning outside
There's a little bit of morning outside
There's a little bit of morning outside
Spread your wings and fly
