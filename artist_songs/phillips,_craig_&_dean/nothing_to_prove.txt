You taught me how to ride a bike
Tie my shoes and fly a plane
How to swim and how to fish
To see a star and make a wish

Said it’s ok to make mistakes
Just don’t get stuck in yesterday
Forgive, forget and move ahead
‘Cause life is what you’re livin’ in

Now you’re gone and all I have
Are memories I hold dear
But if I’m quiet I hear your voice
Still ringin’ in my ears

[Chorus:]
Sayin’ live with no excuses
Love with no regrets
Laugh a lot and leave this life
With nothing left unsaid
Make this world a better place
Don’t be afraid to cry
When it’s finally time to say goodbye
There’s nothin’ to prove, nothin’ to lose, nothin’ to hide

You said life cannot be measured by
The place you live, the car you drive
The thing that counts the day you die
Is who you are and what’s inside

So tell the truth, don’t ever lie
Integrity at any price
Your words, you’re bought, you’re highest prized
So guard it close and live your life

So many things I learned from you
‘Bout life and love and play
I learned more by how you lived
Than what I heard you say

[Repeat Chorus:]

I only wanna live my life
Half as well as you
To leave behind what I receive
Is all I wanna do

[Repeat Chorus:]
