Where can you go
When life leaves you empty
Who can you trust
When promises fail
Why love again
When your heart has been shattered
There is a place
Where you'll be safe

Come as you are
As you are
With your heart wide open
And broken
Come as you are
With your wounds
And your scars
He is waiting
Hear Him saying
Fall into my arms
Come as you are

He sees the worst of your life
And still loves you
Right through the mask
That you try to wear
He knows when you doubt
Is He even really listening
Still calls you son
My precious one

Come as you are
As you are
With your heart wide open
And broken
Come as you are
With your wounds
And your scars
He is waiting
Hear Him saying
Fall into my arms
Come as you are

Weary
Burdened
Heavy
Hurtin'
Run quickly now
Before [?]

Come as you are
As you are
With your heart wide open
Broken
Come as you are
With your wounds
And your scars
He is waiting
Here Him saying

Come as you are
As you are
With your heart wide open
And broken
Come as you are
With your wounds
And your scars
He is waiting
Here Him saying
Fall into my arms
Come as you are
