If you think that you’ve lost your goal
If you think that your life is out of control
Don’t you know, you got to have a made up mind
If in decision is pained your heart
Hold on to the truth, make a new start
Don’t you know, you got to have a made up mind

You got to have courage in the night, cling to what is right
Keeping it between the lines, yeah
You got to be faithful to the truth, God is gonna move
Through a soul with a made up mind.

If confusion is at your door, don’t let him get one foot on the floor.
Don’t you know, you got to have a made up mind
If pride takes you by the hand, let it go, hit your knees take a stand
Don’t you know, you got to have a made up mind

You got to have courage in the night, cling to what is right
Keeping it between the lines, yeah
You got to be faithful to the truth, God is gonna move
Through a soul with a made up mind.

[solo]

You got to have courage in the night, cling to what is right
Keeping it between the lines, yeah
You got to be faithful to the truth, God is gonna move
Through a soul with a made up mind.

Well the rain storm ain't looking around, no no
you win the prize if you don’t back down.
Don’t you know, you got to have a made up mind
Don’t you know, you got to have a made up mind
[repeat]
