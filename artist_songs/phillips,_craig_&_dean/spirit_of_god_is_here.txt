Let's Get honest
Let's get real
Let's get humble
The spirit of God is here
He's a fire to be feared
The spirit of God is here
He is here

[Chorus]
Let's wake our souls
And make a path
Declare our hearts for holiness
He is near
The spirit of God is here
Take off your shoes
And stand in awe
Bow our hearts to the mighty God
He is near
The spirit of God is here

Let's approach Him let's draw near
He is calling
The spirit of God is here
Angel worship saints revere
The spirit of God is here
He is here

[Chorus]

Everybody awake your soul
Get yourself ready
Young and old
Come together 'cause He is near
The spirit of God is here

Everybody awake your soul
Get yourself ready
Young and old
Come together 'cause He is near
The spirit of God is here

[Chorus]
