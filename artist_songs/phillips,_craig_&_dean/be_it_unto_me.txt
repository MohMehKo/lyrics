Oh, Mary, sweet Mary, I must wake you from your sleep.
Don’t be frightened ‘cause I’ve come with a secret you must keep.
There’s a mission so listen, God is calling you to serve;
For this night you will carry the Savior of the world.
So will you go, or will you stay?
Then heaven’s angel heard Mary say,

Be it unto me according to Your word, oh Lord
Be it unto me according to Your word, oh Lord
Lord, shine down Your light, shatter the dark.
Shine down Your love into my heart.
Be it unto me according to Your word, oh Lord.

Oh, brothers and sisters awaken from your sleep.
Don’t be frightened ‘cause the light from heaven must speak.
There’s a mission so listen, God is calling us to serve 
See the dying, hear them crying, bring a Savior to their world
So will you go, or will you stay?
Don’t you want heaven to hear you say

Be it unto me according to Your word, oh Lord
Be it unto me according to Your word, oh Lord
Lord, shine down Your light, shatter the dark.
Shine down Your love into my heart.
Be it unto me according to Your word, oh Lord.

Hear the call that lifts you higher;
God gives wings to your desires.

Be it unto me according to Your word, oh Lord
Be it unto me according to Your word, oh Lord
Lord, shine down Your light, shatter the dark.
Shine down Your love into my heart.
Be it unto me according to Your word
Be it unto me according to Your word
Be it unto me according to Your word, oh, Lord.
