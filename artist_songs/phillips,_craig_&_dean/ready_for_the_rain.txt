I been walking through the desert
And I been talking to myself away too long
It gets lonely when you're the only one
Who hears you when you say you need someone

I'm ready for the rain to fall
I'm ready for your heart to call
My name so loud, it cracks the clouds
And your love comes pouring down
I'm ready for the rain

I prayed for mercy from the heartache
But I was thirsty for a river I couldn't find
Then I found you and you opened up the sky
And I knew you're the reason why

I'm ready for the rain to fall
I'm ready for your heart to call
My name so loud, it cracks the clouds
And your love comes pouring down
I'm ready for the rain

Dust and pain just washed away
The moment that you walked my way

I'm ready for the rain to fall
I'm ready for your heart to call
My name so loud, it cracks the clouds
And your love comes pouring down
I'm ready for the rain, I'm ready for the rain
Ready for the rain
