I know You rescued my soul
His blood has covered my sin
I believe
I believe

My shame He's taken away
My pain is healed in His name
I believe
I believe

I'll raise a banner
'Cause my Lord has conquered the grave

[Chorus]
My Redeemer lives
My Redeemer lives
My Redeemer lives
My Redeemer lives

[Repeat all]

You lift my burdens
And I'll rise with You
I'm dancing on this mountaintop to see Your kingdom come

[Chorus]
