You said "lights on"
And a blindin' sea of stars began to shine
You said 'birds sing"
And a million melodies filled up the sky
You said "this world, spinning through a crowded milky way"
Well the comes up & the sun goes down
God doesn't seem to need my help
But the one who holds the sea in place
Is watchin out for every step I take

[Chorus:]
I think I'll let God be God
Givin' up control
Think I'll relax, step back
It's time for letting go
If you keep the universe in sync
A million years or so
Since the keeper of creation knows
I think I'll let God be God

You clapped you hands
The thunder rose and lightning filled the sky
You bring new life
A tiny newborn starts to cry
Time rolls in and time rolls back out
Never has God needed me to help
The one who sees the sparrow fall
What I need before I even call

[Chorus:]
I think I'll let God be God
Givin' up control
Think I'll relax, step back
It's time for letting go
If you keep the universe in sync
A million years or so
Since the keeper of creation knows
I think I'll let God be God

Yeah nothin takes you by surprise
Never late, always on time
The one who holds the sea in place
Is watchin' out for every step I take

[Chorus:]
I think I'll let God be God
Givin' up control
Think I'll relax, step back
It's time for letting go
If you keep the universe in sync
A million years or so
Since the keeper of creation knows
I think I'll let God be God

[Chorus:]
I think I'll let God be God
Givin' up control
Think I'll relax, step back
It's time for letting go
If you keep the universe in sync
A million years or so
Since the keeper of creation knows
I think I'll let God be God
