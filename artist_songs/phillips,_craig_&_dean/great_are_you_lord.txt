The beauty of Your majesty
Displayed for all the world to see
Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder

The glory of your holiness
The mercy of your faithfulness
Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder
(And) We sing

[Chorus:]
Great are You Lord
For we adore You
Lift up Your name
And fall before You
We stand in awe
And sing great are You Lord
We lift up our voice
We sing holy, holy
Hallelujah
To the one and only
Forevermore
We’ll sing great are You Lord

Through endless ages You will reign
Yet every season you’re the same
Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder

Your power of Your redeeming plan
The grace that offers life to man
Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder
(And) We sing

[Chorus]
