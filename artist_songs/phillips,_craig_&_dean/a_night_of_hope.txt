Another sunset falls, yet nothing's really changed.
Eden's promises feels like a million miles away.
The endless span from God to man grows wider every day;
A price too great for mortal man to pay.

Yet in the darkness see Messiah's guiding light.
A star of mercy shining like a diamond, pure and bright.
And every beam that falls to earth,
Helps declare this noble birth.
Healing comes and Mary's baby cries.

This is a night of hope, it's a night of joy.
This is a night of peace wrapped in a baby boy.
This holy child of promise has come to let us know
That we can sing and dream again.
This is a night of hope.

As shepherds watched their sheep,
The world lies fast asleep.
All unaware a Prince of Peace
Has crossed the go between.
Creator King, Ancient of Days,
A lonely manager lays.
Now fallen man can once again be free.

Oh sacred night, oh glorious night.
Oh, holy night, divine.
Faith, now restored,
Be now reborn by heaven's grand design.

This is a night of hope, it's a night of joy.
This is a night of peace wrapped in a baby boy.
This holy child of promise has come to let us know
That we can sing and dream again.
This holy child of promise has come to let us know
That we can sing and dream again.
This is a night of hope.

Everybody join and sing,
Praises to the newborn king.
This is a night of hope.
Everybody join and sing,
Praises to the newborn king.
Angels always singing glory,
This is a night of peace.
Everybody join and sing,
Praises to the newborn king.
Oh holy night, divine.
Everybody join and sing.
Praises to the newborn king.
This is a night of hope.
