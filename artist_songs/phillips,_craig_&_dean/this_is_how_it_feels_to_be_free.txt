There is a wall that has been standing
Since the day that Adam fell
Sin is where it started
And Sin is why it held
Speakin as a prisoner
Who was there and lived to tell
I remember how it fell

I can here the sound of freedom
Like a distant voice who called
And beckon me to follow
Where I had never gone
And though my heart is willin'
I just stood there at the wall
Prayin somehow it would fall

But in a cross I found a doorway
And a hand that held a key
And when the chains fell at my feet
For the first time I could see

[Chorus:]
This is how it feels to be free
This is what it means to know that 
I am forgiven
This is how it feels to be free
To see that life can be more than i imagined
This is how it feels to be free
This is how it feels to be free

There are days when I'm reminded
Of the prison I was in
Like a livin nightmare
Burning from the viel
I can feel the voice of evil
I can hear the call of sin
But I wont go back again

See, once I've tasted freedom
Then the walls could bind no more
Since mercy gave me wings to fly
Like an eagle I can soar

[Chorus]

Somewhere there's a prison
Where the chains still burn
If not for the grace of god
Those walls could still be mine
So far all the captives are saved

[Chorus]
