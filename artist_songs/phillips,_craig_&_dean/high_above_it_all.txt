I have come to seek your face
I long for you
You are my hiding place
My safe refuge
I find my hope in you
Your peace it carries me through

Waters roar and mountains fall
Still You reign high above it all
You are high above it all
King will fade and nations shake
But you remain high above it all
You are high above it all
Almighty God

I walk through death's valley
I will not fear
Your blood it covers me
You are my shield
When I'm weary and I'm weak
You are all the strength I need

Waters roar and mountains fall
Still You reign high above it all
You are high above it all
King will fade and nations shake
But you remain high above it all
You are high above it all
Almighty God

There is triumph in Your presence
Healing in Your peace
So I will lift my voice
Proclaiming victory

There is triumph in Your presence
Healing in Your peace
So I will lift my voice
Proclaiming victory
Victory
Victory

Waters roar and mountains fall
Still You reign high above it all
You are high above it all
King will fade and nations shake
But you remain high above it all
You are high above it all
You are high above it all
High above it all
Jesus
