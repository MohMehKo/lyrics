It's an open invitation
All are welcome
This is right where you belong
Join the song
Hands are lifting
Voices raising
To the one who
Has been waiting all along
Come on join the song

Let all within us
Lift our hearts and sing

The song of the rescued and redeemed
The song of the ones who've been set free
Hallelujah, chains are gone
Join the song
Join the song
The song that's rising up within
Hope is returning once again
Hallelujah, chains are gone
Join the song
Join the song

For the thirsty, there's a river
For the broken, there's a healer holding on
Come on join the song
All the guilty, find forgiveness
All the weary, find the savior standing strong
So let's join the song

And let all within us
Lift our hearts and sing

The song of the rescued and redeemed
The song of the ones who've been set free
Hallelujah, chains are gone
Join the song
Join the song
The song that's rising up within
Hope is returning once again
Hallelujah, chains are gone

With abandon we will answer
Deep calls to deep
In your presence we are changed

With abandon we will answer
Deep calls to deep
In your presence we are changed
