It's like I woke up
For the first time breathin'
It's like I looked up
For the first time seein'
I'm learning to live again
I'm learning to love again
I'm learning to breath again
It's like I've been born again

It's nothing but open road
Now that I'm not alone
I'm sayin' "I love" to life
This is what hope feels like
Whoa whoa whoa-ah
Whoa whoa whoa-ah
Whoa whoa whoa-ah
Whoa whoa whoa-ah
This is what hope feels like

Now I'm runnin'
Every chain is fallin'
And to your feedom
I can hear you callin'

I'm learning to live again
I'm learning to love again
I'm not going back again
Because I've been born again

It's nothing but open road
Now that I'm not alone
I'm saying "I love" to life
This is what hope feels like
Whoa whoa whoa-ah
Whoa whoa whoa-ah
Whoa whoa whoa-ah
Whoa whoa whoa-ah
This is what hope feels like

You have rolled that stone aside
Because you live so will I
What was dead is now alive
And this is what hope feels like

You have rolled that stone aside
Because you live so will I
What was dead is now alive
And this is what hope feels like

It's nothing but open road
Now that I'm not alone
I'm saying "I love" to life
This is what hope feels like

Nothing but open road
Now that I'm not alone
I'm saying I love to life
This is what hope feels like
Whoa whoa whoa-ah
Whoa whoa whoa-ah
Whoa whoa whoa-ah
Whoa whoa whoa-ah
This is what hope feels like
