[Verse 1]
Your cross gave life
open salvation
for restoration
promise for all
Your grace has made
us part of Your kingdom
living in freedom
as with Your son

[Chorus]
Jesus Your name
is alive
now Your redemption draws into our lives
strong in battle
You overcame
the victories ours
now we sing
Great, Great there is no one like our God
Great, Great there is no one like our God

[Verse 2]
How walls fall down
struggles are broken
eternity spoken
righteously stand
the church will rise
declaring Your kingdom
setting your freedom
blood of Your lamb

[Chorus]
Jesus Your name
is alive
now Your redemption draws into our lives
strong in battle
You overcame
the victories ours
now we sing
Great, Great there is no one like our God
Great, Great there is no one like our God
Great, Great there is no one like our God
Great, Great there is no one like our God

[Bridge]
You reign in all the earth
You reign victorious
Your power is limitless
There is no one like our God
no one like our God
yeaaa
Great, Great there is no one like our God
Great, Great there is no one like our God
Great, Great there is no one like our God
Great, Great there is no one like our God
No one like Our God
