[Verse 1]
Ooohhh [x4]
Everything I am I give you
All I hold inside is for your praise
And it's all for you
All my life to you surrender 
All I have I give to you alone
And it's all for you
It's all for you
It's all for you

My soul sings [x2]
Hallelujah
God great and glorious You are
God great and glorious
My soul sings [x2]
Hallelujah
God great and glorious You are [x2]
Ooohhh [x2]

All the worlds that You've created
Burst in life and beautiful display
And it's all for You
Earth to sky to You surrender
All creation rises at Your name
Yea it's all for You
It's all for You
It's all for You

My soul sings [x2]

My soul sings [x2]

King of angels
