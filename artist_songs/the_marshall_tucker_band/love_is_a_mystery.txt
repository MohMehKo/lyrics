Yes, I'll answer your questions
I've answered them many times before
The answer is I think I love you
So will you answer these questions of mine?

You see I've never been in love before
This is something all new to me
My heart's feeling something all new inside
I say love is a mystery
Love is a mystery

Am I falling in love with you?
Somehow in my heart I hope I do
Just by knowing it's me and it's really you
I'm just falling in love with you
I'm just falling in love with you

I hope you don't think you're gonna change my ways
That's just something I never do
But I'll do mostly anything
Just to fall in love with you
Just to fall in love with you

Am I falling in love with you?
Somehow in my heart I hope I do
Just by knowing it's me and it's really you
I'm just falling in love with you
I'm just falling in love with you
