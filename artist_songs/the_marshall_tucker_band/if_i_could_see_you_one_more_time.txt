Lord I've always been a drifter, seems like I was always passing through
I never met anybody or anything, I just had to come back to you
But the minute I saw you, all my dreams were standing alive
And I would gladly give a hundred of my tomorrows if I could see you just one more time

If I could see you one more time there's just a few things on my mind
Just a few more things that I'd like to tell ya
If I could see you just one more time

As I travel down the highway, got to be the gypsy in my bones
But I want to see your smiling face, makes a man feel so alone
But you've already captured my soul, and slowly you're invading my mind
And I would gladly give a hundred of my tomorrows if I could see you just one more time

If I could see you one more time there's just a few things on my mind
Just a few more things that I'd like to tell ya
If I could see you just one more time

If I could see you one more time
If I could see you one more time
If I could see you one more time.....
