I just run 'round like a fool
Stay in trouble all the time
Got put behind bars yeah
Served two years on the county line

Life aint no good at all
behind these county walls
On a cold concrete pedestal
Oh wrote the words to this song

And how can I slow down
When I can't stop runnin'
My own shadow scares me to death

Got caught in Carolina town
When Woodrough sheriff come around
He caught me in the bed 
With the county sheriff's wife

And how can I slow down
When I can't stop running
My own shadow scares me to death
