The more I look at you
The more that I can see
You're the woman
That could ever be meant for me

I've been looking
For quite some time
For a southern lady
That seems to suit me fine

Ooh southern woman
Seems to suit me fine

I don't know your name
I don't really care
To want a woman like you
Really can't be fair
