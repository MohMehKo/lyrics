What makes two people together from the start
In love with the life of their own
Choose to live their lives in the
Songs that they sing and always bein’ alone
Livin’ their life in a song
Think of a woman, a woman so strong
She leaves her man free to roam
With sweet understanding she lives with his ways
Livin’ her life in a song
Livin’ her life in a song
Think of a woman left lonely
Think of a woman so strong
With love as her guide she stands by my side
Livin’ her life in a song
Livin’ her life in a song
Well, I’m writin’ this song
For the girl that I met on a 
Misty morning somewhere by the sea
I’m tellin’ you true her love brought me through
Her love’s the thing that set me free
Her love’s the thing that set me free
Think of a woman left lonely
Think of a woman so strong
With love as her guide she stands by my side
Livin’ her life in a song
Livin’ her life in a song
