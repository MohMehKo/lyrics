You said you loved me, 
Don't know why I thought you'd be, 
the kind of woman, that'd leave a man in misery. 
I was wrong all along, 
but too stubborn a man to change my mind. 

I couldn't believe, 
Lord I lost you, 
When I knew you loved me all the time. 
I was wrong all along, 
but too stubborn a man to change my mind. 

Should of loved you while I had the chance, 
But I had a feelin' inside. 
'bout all the times, I really loved you, 
but too hardheaded to change my mind
