I can't stand to see a grown man
Hit a little kid
Or get cussed out for somethin'
Not even knowin' what he did

See a man any man
Messin' 'round with your best friend's wife
Or sit helpless in the corner
And watch a man drink away his life
I'm gonna clean up my soul lord
You don't owe me no back pay
I'm gonna tell that to the devil
When I see him today
Walked to a graveyard
May they all rest in peace
I wish they could all go to heaven
I bet two did at least

Someone that don't feel sorry
For the helpless and the blind
Kinda makes you wanna pick up the bible
And memorize every single line
I'm gonna clean up my soul lord
You don't owe me no back pay
I'm gonna tell that to the devil
When I see him today

See a man walk by a beggar
With an empty tin cup
Kinda makes you wanna grab him

By the back of the neck
Knock him down and never pick him up
I'm gonna clean up my soul lord
You don't owe me no back pay
I'm gonna tell that to the devil
When I see him today

I'm gonna tell that to the devil
When I see him today
