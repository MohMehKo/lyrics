Hired me on a greenhorn
Didn't know a rope from a horse
But I wanted to be a cowboy

So I took the job of course
The foreman he said "Son you gonna ride
At the end of my herd"

All the wranglers sat around in a circle
And nobody said a word
'Cause there's a woman in my dreams
That keeps me alive

If I ever see her again
Lord I'll never ride drag on another cattle drive

There's a rumor goin' round
That we're near a Kansas City town
And when you're ridin drag on this cattle drive
It takes 'bout a week for the word to get around

'Cause there's a woman in my dreams
That keeps me alive
If I ever see her again
Lord I'll never ride drag on another cattle drive
