Lord it seems, my whole life
Ain't been nothing but trouble
When I try to straighten things out
Hell, things double
Ever since I met you I'm doing what a man's supposed to do
About love

A lot of folks think that love is wrong
And they don't know what's going on
Ever since the day they told me your name
This old heart of mine has been under lock and chain
Of love

I always knew that you made the sun shine
I never thought I'd see the day I'd make you mine
And I'll always be singing rhymes
I'll always be writing lines
About love

Don't want you to think
I'm coming on a little too strong
Just wanna let you know
Ain't nothing going wrong

And everything I ever tried to do
Lord, it just comes right back to you
I guess that's what love's supposed to do
I'll always be singing rhymes
I'll always be writing lines
About love

And everything I ever tried to do
Lord, it just comes right back to you
I guess that's what love's supposed to do
I'll always be singing rhymes
I'll always be writing lines
I'll always be singing rhymes
I'll always be writing lines
About love
