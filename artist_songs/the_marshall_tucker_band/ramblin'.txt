I've got ramblin',
ramblin' on my mind, Lord.
Gotta find me a woman
of a different kind.
Now she's gone, Lord,
I've got ramblin' on my mind.

I've got Worries,
worries on my mind, Lord.
Ever since you left me, baby,
I've got peace of mind.
Now she's gone, Lord,
I've got ramblin' on my mind.

When my lady comes home to me,
oh, when my lady, comes home to me,
need some money to pay the bills.
I just tell her these simple words --
I've got ramblin' on my mind,
I've got ramblin' on my mind,
I've got ramblin' on my mind,
I've got ramblin' on my mind,
I've got ramblin' on my mind,
I've got ramblin' on my mind.
Lord, I've got ramblin',
ramblin' on my mind.

I've got Worries,
worries on my mind, Lord.
Ever since you left me, baby,
I've got peace of mind.
Now she's gone, Lord,
ramblin' on my mind.
