Everybody
Listen to me
I can't remember
Where i went wrong

People tell me
I'm a good man
But you know how people are
Well darlin' i don't know

Well the answer
Is i love you
Your the only thing
To keep me from all wrong

Well i been thinkin'
About to morrow
And i keep on askin' myself
Why i gotta go

Well the answer
Is i love you
Your the only thing
To keep me from all wrong

Well i'll be leavin'
In the morning
Don't you worry darlin'
The whole time i'm gone

Well the answer
Is i love you
Your the only thing
To keep me from all wrong
