I'm sittin' in Chicago on the thirtieth floor 
Lookin' down on the city below 
My heart is cold as the wind through the streets 
And outside it's starting to snow 

Weeks ago I left you in sunny Caroline 
Sittin' in our home in the pines 
I got a job to do that takes me away from you 
But your love still remains on my mind 

I'm in love with that girl from that roebuck town 
Since I met her she's made my life so sound 
She's sweet and she's kind and she's mine all mine 
She's the best thing that I'll ever find 

The city lights have gone 
And the night has brought a storm 
And soon I'll be headin' home to you 
I can taste your wine 
Though it's been a long, long time 
No more will I have the Chicago blues 

I'm in love with that girl from that roebuck town 
Since I met her she's made my life so sound 
She's sweet and she's kind and she's mine all mine 
She's the best thing that I'll ever find 

Look, look around there's snow on the ground 
What a cold hard life that I've known 
But my love still glows like the city below 
Because of all the love she's shown 

I'm on a southbound train 
Takin' me away from this snow 
Takin' me where I really want to go 
Out of these chilly winds and havin' no friends 
I need the warmth of your sweet lovin' soul 

I'm in love with that girl from that roebuck town 
Since I met her she's made my life so sound 
She's sweet and she's kind and she's mine all mine 
She's the best thing that I'll ever find 
Got the windy city blues
