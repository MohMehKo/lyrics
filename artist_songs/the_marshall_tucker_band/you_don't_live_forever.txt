I had a lover 
prettiest thing I ever seen 
Just like all good things
There was a day she went away 
Had the best mother that a man could have
And my family understands 
When I see Daddy, my Daddy 
I say to myself 
He's a hell of a man 
So I'm sittin' here 
Thinkin' about 
How we used to be together 
And it's a lonesome road 
Even I 
Tell you that you don't live forever 
No you don't live forever 
Listen to me baby 
What I'm tryin' to say 
I can't understand it 
When you treat me this way
