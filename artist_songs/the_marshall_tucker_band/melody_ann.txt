Many a time I feel so lonesome
Many a day I've been so doggone tired
When I get lonesome, yes I do
I think about true love
And when I think about true love
I think about you

So I'm singing, this here song, for Melody Ann
And I'm so doggone proud
That I'm her man and she's all mine
My Melody Ann

Been many a morning
Since I seen you
Seen many a sunrise, yes
Lord knows I've drove many miles
But you know the best thing About going home
Is to see you, standing there, with a smile 

And I'm singing, this here song,
for Melody Ann
And I'm so doggone proud
That I'm her man and she's all mine
My Melody Ann
My Melody Ann
I love ya darlin'
