I met Virginia two summers ago
Up in them mountains teaching school
All alone in a one room shack

Teaching the children all she knew
We spent a lot of hours together
And one day she said she'd love me for all time
And I'm in love with my Virginia
And I hope she don't change her mind
We took a trip to Montana
Guess we were looking for gold
Never saw a trace of it
But it was everywhere we were told
Worked in a mine for thirteen hours every day
I took one look at my Virginia
And knew she wasn't meant to live that way

The going was rough
But she treated me so kind
I'm in love with Miss Virginia
And I hope she don't change her mind

Now we're back in Carolina
Up in them Smokies where we belong
Never knew why we went away
Can't understand why we were gone
Been with her twenty years
And all those years she made me feel so fine
And she still tells me that she loves me
And I hope she don't change her mind
And I hope she don't change her mind
