There's something in your eyes that remind me
Of all the loves I've left behind me
Looks on your face yes they tell me
That I should have never started loving you

It was true when they said that I was mean and cruel
All the loves I've had I've made them out as fools
Now the tide has turned and I'm lonely too
I should have never started loving you

I should have never started loving you
After all the things that we've been through
I could have spent my whole life with you
I should have never started loving you

You hugged me in a way that I had never felt
Sky turned so dark I thought I knew you well
I'm so lonely girl wish I could leave this world
I should have never started loving you

I should have never started loving you
After all the things that we've been through
I could have spent my whole life with you
I should have never started loving you

[Solo]

It was true when they said that I was mean and cruel
All the loves I've had I've made them out as fools
Now the tide has turned and I'm lonely too
I should have never started loving you

I should have never started loving you
After all the things that we've been through
I could have spent my whole life with you
I should have never started loving you
I should have never started loving you
I should have never started loving you
I should have never started loving you
