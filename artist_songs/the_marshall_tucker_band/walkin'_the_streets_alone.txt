I'm singin' a song 'cause I'm in misery 
Sick and tired of them sad successes 
That maybe will be 
Done gone and pulled the rug out from under me 
Oh lord show me the way 
Well I'm layin' in an alley 
I can't hear the way and why 
Can't move my legs can't see 
No I ain't blind 
Ain't been the same since you 
Said that you ain't mine 
Oh lord show me the way 
And one time I had money 
Everything a man could need 
But I was so unhappy 
So did I really succeed 
Then you walked up and said you were leavin' me 
Oh lord show me the way 
And you've got me walkin' the streets alone 
Can't even give the dog a bone 
Ain't got no one, not even you to call my own 
Oh lord show me the way 
And you've got me walkin the streets alone
