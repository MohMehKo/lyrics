I can't imagine how the world would be
Not to see the gray squirrel climbing in an oak tree
To walk through a corn field and not see the wild duck flyin
I believe before the world ever got that bad
I'd be on my knees cryin

Won't you fly, oh eagle fly
You better run, little cottontail, run
I hope you both live long enough to see the setting sun

The lion ain't got no jungle
Old black bear got no cave
And that poor old alligator
Just bout seen his better days

Won't you fly, oh eagle fly
You better run, little cottontail, run
I hope you both live long enough to see the setting sun

On a cold winter morning I could look up in the sky
And I could see the wild geese fly
And on a warm spring day I could look up in the air
And I could see the yellow butterfly

How long has it been since you heard the tiny flutter
Of the little wing of a hummingbird
And I once saw the picture of a buffalo
A thousand in the herd

Won't you fly, oh eagle fly
You better run, little cottontail, run
I hope you both live long enough to see the setting sun

Fly, mister eagle, fly
You better run little cottontail, run
