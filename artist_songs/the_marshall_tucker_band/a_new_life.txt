Hey, mister, got a road map?
I'm kinda lost
Gotta get to Georgia tonight
Don't care what it costs
Been down in Denver jail for four long years
And I'm so homesick I could die

Got a sweet woman back home
Waitin there for me
Least in all her letters, Lord
She said she'd be
Waitin there with open arms
Born new life for me
And I'm so homesick I could die

Shot a man in Denver
Over some money owed
So she told me
That I had to go
But I paid my time
And a new life is gonna be mine

And a new life is gonna be mine
