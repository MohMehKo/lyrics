Tried to keep me wonderin' 
All the time 
Didn't think I knew, Lord 
What you was up to 
But everywhere you go 
Met them friends of mine 
And you know that they've been tellin' me 
Everything you do 
You ain't foolin' me 
I knew it all the time
You ain'foolin' me
I'm not the only man on your mind, yeah 

It make my bones shiver 
When I think about lettin' you go 
So why don't you tell the truth 
Everbody seems to know 
You ain't foolin' me 
If there's something let me know
I'm tired of all your games 
There's not much left for me to know

It make my bones shiver 
When I think about lettin' you go 
So why don't you tell the truth 
Everbody seems to know 
You ain't foolin' me 
I knew it all the time 
You ain't foolin me 
I'm not the only man on your mind 
You ain't foolin' me 
You ain't foolin' nobody but yourself 
You ain't foolin' me 
You ain't foolin'nobody but yourself, momma
