I've tasted sour 
And I've tasted sweet 
Seen bitter days draw a tear 
I've been swept off my feet 
Seems I've been here many times before 
Every time I reached out 
I couldn't unlock the door 
I'm holding on
to things that used to be 
Holding on to things 
that again will never be 
And I'm always gonna hold on to you 

I've seen some good times I've seen some bad 
Been caught in situations 
that left me oh, so sad 
I'm holding on to things that used to be 
Holding on to things that again can never be 
And I'm always gonna hold on to you 

I used to live my life
In late night dreams 
Reality was hidden by the dark 
It was an easy life it seemed 
I'm holding on to things that used to be 
Holding on to things that again will never be 
And I'm always gonna hold on to you
