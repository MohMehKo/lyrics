Well I'm ridin' along
Singin' the same ol' cowboy song
That's been sung a hundred times before
Ain't got nothin' but my name
And I'm the only man I know to blame
But I'm livin', I'm happy and I'm free

Just listen to the wind blow
Let it blow, let it blow
Sand over my trail
I got my saddle on the ground
And that ol' moon, he can still be found
Hidin' in the desert sky

I like simple things in life
Like a prairie breeze
A good stout horse between my knees
Just bein' alone, just bein' me
And when I die let me die
With a dream in my mind
A smile on my face and no trouble behind
And no cross on my grave
To show my restin' place

So I can listen to the wind blow
Let it blow, let it blow
Sand over my trail
I got my saddle on the ground
And that ol' moon, he can still be found
Hidin' in the desert sky

Won't you bury me with my chaps on
And my six-gun strapped to my side
So I can watch the moon a-hidin'
In the desert sky
Hidin' in the desert sky
Hidin' in the desert sky
Hidin' in the desert sky
