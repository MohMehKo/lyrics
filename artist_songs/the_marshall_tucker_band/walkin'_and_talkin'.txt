I'm standin here Lord, ain't got a penny to my name
I been walkin around like a fool
Ever since you left, Lord things ain't been the same
You got me walkin and talkin away my blues

You got me walkin and talkin away my blues, Lord
It's the only way, woman, I'll forget about you
Someone sittin down and talk the talk
Oh woman I'll take me a long walk
You got me walkin and talkin away my blues...

Lord it wasn't my fault
I wasn't completely to blame
But honey how I miss you
I sit here every night, Lord, out loud I call your name
You got me walkin and talkin away my blues

You got me walkin and talkin away my blues, Lord
It's the only way, woman, I'll forget about you
Someone sittin down and talk the talk
Oh woman I'll take a long walk
Walkin and talkin
Walkin and talkin
Walkin and talkin
Walkin and talkin my blues!
