I had a lady...I thought was so fine
I knew she loved me...she stayed on my mind
And then one morning...I woke up 
And she was gone
There was a note...layin' by the bedside
Tellin' me she's gone
And now she's gone gone gone just gone
Now she's gone gone gone just gone
Now she's gone gone gone just gone
She found another...lord
Much better than me
Treats her like a lady
Like she oughta be
And now she's happy...lord
So happy and free
Don't have to worry...lord
About a man like me
And now she's gone gone gone just gone
Now she's gone gone gone just gone
Now she's gone gone gone just gone

She found another...lord
Much better than me
Treats her like a lady
Like she oughta be
And now she's happy...lord
So happy and free
Don't have to worry 
About a man like me
And now she's gone gone gone just gone
Now she's gone gone gone just gone
And she's gone gone gone just gone
