I been down around Houston,Texas
Where the sun shines most of the time
I been drivin' about six hours
Tryin' to reach that Arkansas line
But Texarkana's an hour ahead 
And I got to keep my wheels rolling

But woman you're always on my mind
Twenty-four hours at a time
So my woman I'm hopin' you feel the
Same way

Woman you know that I miss you
And I can't miss you no more
I got this White doing seventy miles an hour
She's loaded, she's down to the floor
'Cause I got to reach that Arkansas line
Before the sun goes down, yeah

But woman you're always on my mind
Twenty-four hours at a time                  
So my woman  I'm hopin' you feel the
Same way

Woman you know I need you 
I been on the road so much
I'm tired of looking at the highway
Got to keep in touch some way 

I been down around Houston,Texas
Where the sun shines most of the time
I been driving about six hours
Tryin' to reach that Arkansas line
But Texarkana's an hour ahead 
And I got to keep my wheels rolling

But woman you're always on my mind 
Twenty-four hours at a time             
So my woman, I'm hopin' you feel the
Same Way
