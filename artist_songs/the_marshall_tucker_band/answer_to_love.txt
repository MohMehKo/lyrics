Does anybody here know the answer to love
I believe that I misunderstood
Does anybody here know the answer to love
Please tell me if you would
I thought love was supposed to make me happy
I thought love was supposed to make me glad
Does anybody here know the answer to love
Mine's all sad
Does anybody here have an extra key
To a broken heart
Does anybody here have an introductory lesson
On how love is supposed to start
I thought love would make me happy
And I thought love would make me glad
Does anybody here know the answer to love
Mine's goin' bad          
Mine's goin' bad

Does anybody here know how to wipe a tear
From a grown man's eye
Would anybody here try to help me out
So far all I've been told is lies
I thought love would make me happy
So far it's only made me blue
Does anybody here know the answer to love
Is it me or you
Is it me or you
Is it me or you
