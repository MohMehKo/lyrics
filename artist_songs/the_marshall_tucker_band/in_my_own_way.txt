I know that sometimes you think I don't love you
...but I can't act like we just met all the time
And I can say
without a doubt
you're the only love
I'll ever find
And IN my own Way 
I love you
And In my own Way
I need you
And In my own Way
I've got to have your love
There's a special place in my heart that's Occupied by you
There ain't no one 
On god's earth
gonna take your place
And I can say
without a doubt
you're the only love
I'd ever find
And IN my own Way 
I love you
And In my own Way
I need you
And In my own Way
I've got to have your love
And I can say
without a doubt
you're the only love
I'd ever find
And IN my own Way 
I love you
And In my own Way
I need you
And In my own Way
I've got to have your love
