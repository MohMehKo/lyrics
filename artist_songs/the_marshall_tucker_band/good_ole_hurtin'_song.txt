This ole beer gut I got don't get no smaller
If I thought it'd do any good I'd go ahead and call her
I've been drinkin' up my pain since she's been gone
For every fool there's a good boss too
And the same ole sad, sad song

[Chorus]

That beer would go a lot farther with a good ole hurtin' song
Drink a few with a song or two, It never takes me long
As long as I got money I'll stay where I belong
Yeah, that beer would go a lot farther with a good ole hurtin' song

My friends keep tellin' me boy you oughta quit it

They ain't the ones that have to drink to forget it
Forgettin' don't come easy when you're sober and all alone
So I pop my tops and play the jukebox and the pain is gone

[Chorus]

That beer would go a lot farther with a good ole hurtin' song
Drink a few with a song or two, It never takes me long
As long as I got money I'll stay where I belong
Yeah, that beer would go a lot farther with a good ole hurtin' song

As long as I got money I'll stay where I belong
Yeah, that beer would go a lot farther with a good ole hurtin' song
