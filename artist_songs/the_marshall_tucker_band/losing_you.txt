I told you once and I told you twice 
And I ain't gonna tell you no more
You don't do nothin' that I tell you
You say it's time for me to go

I finally found out the way you are 
And it's so hard for me to take
I can't understand your feelin's 
Maybe we waited a little too late

Ain't no denyin' you been lyin' 
Ain't no mistakin' my heart is breakin'
Ain't to much choosin' 
That I'm losin', losin' you

Yesterday I got the news
About the way you been doin' me
Never thought it'd end this way
Guess I was too blind to see

Ain't no denyin' you been lyin' 
Ain't no mistakin' my heart is breakin'
Ain't to my choosin' 
That I'm losin', losin' you

I've got the blues.........
And there's one thing I'll always know
A woman can be such a bad thing
Makes a man feel so low

Ain't no denyin' you been lyin' 
Ain't no mistakin' my heart is breakin'
Ain't to my choosin' 
That I'm losin', losin' you

Ain't no denyin' you been lyin' 
Ain't no mistakin' my heart is breakin'
Ain't to my choosin' 
That I'm losin' you
