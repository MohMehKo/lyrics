Well my idea of a good time 
Is walkin' my property line 
And knowin' the mud on my boots is mine 

Watchin' them leaves 
Turnin' from green to gold 
There ain't no way in this world 
That can make a man feel old 

That's when I get lovin' on my mind 
I get lovin' on my mind 
And if someone wants to know 
Why I'm a-hurryin' all the time 
You just tell 'em I got lovin' 
Oh, sweet lovin' 
Tell 'em I got lovin' on my mind 

Well there's two things I think are pretty 
One's a black Arabian mare 
And the other one is a woman 
Who you can't stand to stare at 

Ah, when that happens 
I get weak at both knees 
If I'm out a-choppin' wood 
I leave the ax in the tree 
'cause I get lovin' on my mind 
I get lovin' on my mind 

And if someone wants to know 
Why I'm a-hurryin' all the time 
You just tell 'em I got lovin' 
Oh sweet lovin' 
Tell 'em I got lovin' on my mind 

Just tell 'em I got lovin' 
Oh sweet lovin' 
Tell 'em I got lovin' on my mind 
My idea of a good time 
Is walkin' my property line
