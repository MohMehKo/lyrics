Well she's bound and determined
To make a fool out of me
Yeah she's bound and determined
To keep me in misery

Yeah she's bound and determined 
Lord 'cause she's that kind of woman
Gonna make a fool out of me

Don't know why I been trying
To put up with all her lying
I can't help but denying
She's trying to make a fool out of me
Well she's bound and determined
Lord 'cause she's that kind of woman
Gonna make a fool out of me
She tells me that she loves me
And she tells me all the time
That woman I got lord
'Bout to make me lose my mind
