She said that she were leavin'
And that was yesterday
She packed her bags cryin'
And slowly she walked away
I ain't never seen a woman
Who could love me for a day
And I ain't never seen nobody
Who could take my low down ways

She said that she was tired
And was going to carry on
But I will always think of her
And the memories that linger on
I ain't never seen a woman
Who could love me for a day
And I ain't never seen nobody
Who could take my low down ways

I ain't never seen a woman
Who could love me for a day
And I ain't never seen nobody
Who could take my low down ways
And I ain't never seen nobody
Who could take my low down ways
