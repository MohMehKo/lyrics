You're taking me back
Showing me history
Making me high with those big brown eyes
You're taking me back
Reading me the whole story
Making me feel like your love is something new

(Taking me back)
I love some, love some
(Taking me back, taking me back)
I think I love someone
(Taking me back)
I love some, I love some
(Taking me back, taking me back)
You've got to be someone
You've got to be some - be the someone

Your taking me back
Showing my life to me
Driving me mad when you say that you care
Your taking me home
Somewhere away from here
No one will know, we'll take the road to nowhere

(Taking me back)
I love some, I love some
(Taking me back, taking me back)
I think I love someone
(Taking me back)
I love some, I love some
(Taking me back)
You've got to be someone
Be the someone

I love some, love some
I think I love someone
(Taking me back)
I love some, love some
(Taking me back, taking me back)
You've got to be someone

(Taking me back)
I love some, love some
(Taking me back)
I think I love someone

(Taking me back)
I love some, love some
(Taking me back, taking me back)
You've got to be someone

(Taking me back)
I love some, love some
(Taking me back)
I think I love someone
