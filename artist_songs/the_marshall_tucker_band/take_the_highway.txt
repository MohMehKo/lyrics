Take the highway 
Lord knows I've been gone too long 
Lot of sad days, yeah 
One day you'll turn around 
and I'll be gone 
And the time has finally come 
for me to pack my bags and walk away 
Hear me say...

I'll be back someday 
But darlin' please don't 
wait for me too long 
There's just one place I can't stay 
Memories of your love still linger on 
And the time has finally come 
for me to pack my bags and walk away 
Here me say....

I'll be back someday 
But darlin' please don't 
wait for me too long 
There's just one place I can't stay 
Memories of your love still linger on 
And the time has finally come 
for me to pack my bags and walk away 
Here me say....

Take the highway 
Take the highway 
Take the highway 
And the time has finally come 
for me to pack my bags and walk away 
Here me say....
