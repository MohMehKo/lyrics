As a young man I was raised by men of the cloth 
and I was tought to judge men equal and not to find their faults 
until one day I witnessed a tragic thing 
the men lay on the church steps, slain 
and when the smoke cleared a tall man holstered his gun 
the bright day ended and a cloud did cover the sun 
I found hate in my heart that I'd never known before 
I'll see this man hang and if that's the one thing that I know for sure 

Silverado you'll hang by the hangman's tree and you'll die in misery 

His face remained in my eyes as I grew through the years 
I practiced shooting every day while trying to hold back the tears 
I travelled through Oklahoma and Texas to the Rio Grande 
knowing when I met Silverado the Lord would steady my hand 

Silverado you'll hang by the hangman's tree and you'll die in misery 

Then the day came I dreamed of for years 
Silverado stood before me and my heart it pounded in fear 
as he turned and saw my eyes he knew why I'd come 
and without a flick of the eyes he went for his gun 
and as I caused a fight tears come to my eyes 
when he collapsed before me I dropped my gun an sighed 

Silverado you'll hang by the hangman's tree and you'll die in misery
