I rode in to town today
And in my heart I said,
"Lord, I'd love to stay"
Something in me said
"Boy, move on"
Don't know what it is
The good Lord bred it in my bones

And I'm searchin' for a rainbow
And if the wind ever shows me where to go
You'll be waitin' at the end 
Then I'll know 
I'll say, "To Hell with that pot of gold"

This old mare I'm ridin' She's gettin' kinda tired
But in my heart she knows there's this one desire
She's gonna take me to the end of our road,
Then she'll lay down and die and I'll say, "God rest her soul"
