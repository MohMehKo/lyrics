I remember long ago when I was just a boy
Raised in the country that have old country stores
Chasing shadows down the road I remember well
Every story that my mama told in a house near the well

So I'll stay in the country, that's where I was born
Live my life by in Carolina, that's where I belong

I remember Sunday evening sitting outside
With all my uncles and my daddy by my side
We played those old songs too, we brought the night in
At the house in the country air I remember then

So I'll stay in the country, that's where I was born
Live my life by in Carolina, that's where I belong

So I'll stay in the country, that's where I was born
Live my life by in Carolina, that's where I belong

So I'll stay in the country, that's where I was born
Live my life by in Carolina, that's where I belong

Stay in the country
