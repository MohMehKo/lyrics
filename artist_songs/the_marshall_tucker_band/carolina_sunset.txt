I love a Carolina sunset
That's one thing a man will never forget
It brings heaven a little bit closer to Earth
Makes you feel like what you got
Lord, ain't it been worth everything we been through together

Taking the good
Taking the bad
Taking whatever

I love to feel the Smoke, the Smoky Mountain breeze
That's enough to put any man's mind at ease
You know you ain't living on borrowed time
Just grab my hand and walk with me to the end of time
And we'll go through life together

Taking the good
Taking the bad
Taking whatever
Under a Carolina sunset
Carolina sunset

Carolina sunset
Carolina sunset

I love a Carolina sunset
That's one thing a man will never forget
It brings heaven a little bit closer to Earth
Makes you feel like what you got
Lord, ain't it been worth everything we been through together

Taking the good
Taking the bad
Taking whatever
Under a Carolina sunset
Carolina sunset
Carolina sunset
