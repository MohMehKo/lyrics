They got their name
From an old key chain
Left lyin' on the floor
They said it came 
From an old man that played
You know we opened up the door

So they took off on their own
And they left their families home
Takin' it day by day
And they spend most of their time
Writin' songs 'bout Caroline
They gonna make it, one day

The years, they passed
And the songs, went by
Like travelin' through those blue ridge mountain skies
All the years today have all gone by
You can still see it in their eyes

So they played from Caroline 
To the coast of California
Workin' every day
Makin' all their dreams come true
Brought the music back to you
You know they made it there this way

Wasn't that long ago
Seems to me
The long hard ride is over now
Can't you see
Can't you see

So they played from Caroline
To the coast of California
Workin' every day
Makin' all their dreams come true
Brought the music back to you
You know they made it there this way

So they played from Caroline
To the coast of California
Workin' every day
Makin' all their dreams come true
Brought the music back to you
You know they made it there this way
