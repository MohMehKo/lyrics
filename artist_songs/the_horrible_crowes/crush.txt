Pour yourself a drink
I'll sing you a song
Don't worry about the money, honey
I got a tab a mile long
Bathe me up in light
Call me when you drown
I can wait all night
I've spent my whole life
Less up than my downs

I know a secret everybody tell
Who goes to heaven, who goes to hell
And I know one thing sure is true
I never kept a secret
I got a crush on you

You're everybody's dream
Out on the schoolboy yard
They tumble like an injury
Just about you all night long
All night long
And there was a fire
In your breast and in my brain
Your fingers on my fingertips
Making lines in the windowpane

I know a secret everybody tell
Who goes to heaven, who goes to hell
And I know one thing sure is true
I never kept a secret
I got a crush on you

If you should go there before I do
God's gonna trouble the water
Tell all my friends that I'm coming too
God's gonna trouble the water
Sometimes I'm up, lord, and sometimes I'm down
God's gonna trouble the water
Sometimes I'm almost level with the ground
God's gonna trouble the water

If you should go there before I do
God's gonna trouble the water
Tell all my friends that I'm coming too
And God's gonna trouble the water
Sometimes I'm up, lord, and sometimes I'm down
God's gonna trouble the water
And sometimes I'm almost level with the ground
God's gonna trouble the water

I got a crush on you
