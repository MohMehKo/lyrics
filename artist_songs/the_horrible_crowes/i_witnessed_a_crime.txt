I guess the moon it had it out for us
And the night and the stars the same
Everything she touched turned to stone or died eventually
Or was never seen the same again

Yeah, and this heart I had
You never sympathize
And while you held my hand
I think I witnessed a crime

While she drove we sat in silence
All I could do was try to breathe
Her and I we never talked too much or licked our wounds
Just lived between the hours of sleep

And in this dream I had
My screams were baby's breath
I watched her steal the air
Right from the atmosphere

Oh this heart I had
You never paid no mind
And on the long drive home
I think I witnessed a crime

And she said I just went crazy from the heat
And I just lit a little fire under your feet
And that's not so bad see people do it all the time
It's just a little bit of blood in your eyes
So boy, stop all your crying

And all my debonair
Died in her arms one night
You go so quietly
Once you've seen the end

Oh this heart I had
You never paid no mind
And on the drive home
I think I witnessed a crime
