My love, my love, you're the sting of the scorpion
Consider, now, the angels, a little lower than you
And they twist and they turn, and they hold their breath 'til it's blue
And they can't turn away like I can, when you're lookin' like you do

Looky Black Betty, what they're tying to you
You did the very thing, baby, that I asked you not to do
And now you got yourself caught in the silk spiderweb
I hope the money fills the holes, can see the roof is caving in

My heart, my heart, you're the moon and her shining light
Darkness and void of form, like you were keeping me alive
And I've been dreaming of poisonings from the venom of my enemies
Clever as the viper, dear, but gentle as a stampede of stones

Looky Black Betty, what they're tying to you
You did the very thing, baby, that I asked you not to do
Now you got yourself caught in the silk spiderweb
I hope the money fills the holes, can see the roof is caving in

And they want you to doubt every trust that you've known
And they wanna find the holes in the armor exposed
And they come on whispering,
If you just do this for me...
And turn and show their teeth just before they're sinking in
And better than described and deeper the decent
I never thought we'd have to learn to doubt our friends
And better than described, so much deeper the decent
I never thought we'd have to learn to doubt our friends

Looky Black Betty, what they're tying to you
You did the very thing, baby, that I asked you not to do
Now you got yourself caught in the silk spiderweb
I hope the money fills the holes, can see the roof is caving in

Looky Black Betty, what they're tying to you
You did the very thing, baby, that I asked you not to do
Now you got yourself caught in the silk spiderweb
I hope the money fills the holes in the place I used to stand
