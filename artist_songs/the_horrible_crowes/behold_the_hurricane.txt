I remember everything we had. Every breath of this house creaking.
I'm familiar with the cold and the windows and the doors.
And the sound of my heart beating.
Beating in and out of time.

And it's such a shame. I heard the wind say this morning.
Be still my heart. I age by years at the mention of your name.
What a pity this season. You remember me my lover.
I don't recognize myself. I'm not the man you love.
Behold the hurricane. Behold the hurricane.

I walk around these empty rooms. We once moved like the morning.
Silhouettes they haunt this house like a memory haunts me now as if it were a dream.
As if it were a dream.

It's such a shame. I heard the wind say this morning.
Be still my heart. I age by years at the mention of your name.
What a pity this season. You remember me my lover.
I don't recognize myself. I'm not the man you love.
Behold the hurricane. Behold the hurricane.

I heard the moon has visions of her nightly.
I heard the mighty rivers cry out her name.
And I saw the heavens and the earth.
Yes I saw the heavens and the earth cry over you.

It's such a shame. I heard the wind say this morning.
Be still my heart. I age by years at the mention of your name.
What a pity this season. You remember me my lover.
I don't recognize myself. I'm not the man you love.
Behold the hurricane. Behold the hurricane.

At the door the leaves had fallen.
Suddenly I realized that you were gone.
Suddenly I realized that you were gone.
Behold the hurricane.
