In the dark I like to read her mind
But I'm frightened of the things I might find
Oh there must be something she's thinking of to tear her away
When I tell her that I'm falling in love, why does she say

Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry, ohh

I try so hard not to get upset
Because all the trouble I'll get
Oh she tells me tears are something to hide and something to fear
And I try so hard to keep it inside so no one can hear

Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry, ohh

She wants me
But only part of the time
She wants me 
If she can keep me in line

Keep it down now, voices carry
Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Ohhhh hush, she says, shut up, she says, shut up
Oh why can't you just keep it down
Voices carry
Hush hush, she might overhear
Hush hush, voices carry
Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry
