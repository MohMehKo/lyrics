Whoa

I came down from the mountain, took my youth from the fountain and filled this town with music
Yeah Main Street's the same street we grew up too fast and crashed before we knew it

Will I ever make it, I don't know
I'm at the mercy of another show

And so we go
Whoa
And so we go dancin' after midnight
Whoa
Ain't got no choice, but baby got you by my side
Whoa, dancin' after midnight

Whoa
Whoa

There was a girl who came to shows and everybody knows and by the way she's dancing
Yeah after midnight I make 'em sing and I make 'em cry but she's the last one standing

She sings along with every word she knows,
And every word she sang into my soul

And so we go
Whoa
And so we go dancin' after midnight
Whoa
Ain't got no choice, but baby got you by my side
Whoa, dancin' after midnight

Chasin' after dreams, fallin' through the seams, yeah you took me there and I found you dancin' after Midnight
