My life is only what it is, baby
I've only got what I can give, they say
You give it all, you get it back someday
So how do we make the same mistakes
You know that love don't cost a thing

So, ooh, bless your soul
Can't get away, everybody grows old
The money, the money, the money's all gone
But it's funny, it's funny cause love isn't gone
Ooh, bless your heart
You spent it all on a fallen star
The money, the money, the money's all gone
But it's funny, it's funny cause love still goes on
Goes on, goes on, goes on, on, on
Goes on, goes on, goes on, on, on

My life turned 'round, went back in time, crazy
Sent shivers shootin' through my spine, maybe
I'm wastin' time standin' in line and
I spend it all but just to find that
Maybe love left us all behind

No, ooh, bless your soul
Can't get away, everybody grows old
The money, the money, the money's all gone
But it's funny, it's funny cause love isn't gone
Ooh, bless your heart
You spent it all on a fallen star
The money, the money, the money's all gone
But it's funny, it's funny cause love still goes on
Goes on, goes on, goes on, on, on
Goes on, goes on, goes on, on, on

Love goes, love goes on
Love goes, love goes on
Love goes, love goes on
The love goes, love goes on

Even when you're broken down
Runnin' out of solid ground

Love goes, love goes on
The love goes, love goes on

Ooh, bless your soul
Can't get away, everybody grows old
The money, the money, the money's all gone
But it's funny, it's funny cause love isn't gone
Ooh, bless your heart
You spent it all on a fallen star
The money, the money, the money's all gone
But it's funny, it's funny cause love still goes on
Goes on, goes on, goes on, on, on
Goes on, goes on, goes on, on, on

Even when you're broken down
Runnin' out of solid ground
Goes on, goes on, goes on, on, on
Goes on, goes on, goes on, on, on

Even when you're broken down
Runnin' out of solid ground
Goes on, goes on, goes on, on, on
Goes on, goes on, goes on, on, on
