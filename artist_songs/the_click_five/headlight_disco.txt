I've been knocking so
Come to your front door
Well, your TV's on so i
Know your home for sure

I got a new set of wheels
We can go for a ride
Why you waiting the
Night has just begun

I'm gonna make you come to a
Oh oh oh oh
To a headlight disco

Oh oh oh oh
To a headlight disco

(headlight disco)
(keep your eyes on the road)
(headlight disco)

I'm full throttle,
my tank's filled to the top
(to, to the top)
Red and blue in view
I ain't gonna stop
(ain't gonna stop)

Give me the green light
Don't worry, baby
I've got control
(control, yeah)
Don't be shy, girl
The night is oh-so young

I'm gonna make you come to a
Oh oh oh oh
To a headlight disco
(headlight disco)

Oh oh oh oh
To a headlight disco
(headlight disco)

The radios
Are all in tune
A thousand cars
A disco ball when
The headlight moves
Were gonna dance
'til we see the sun

Baby, I made you come to a

Oh oh oh oh
To a headlight disco
(headlight disco)

Oh oh oh oh
To a headlight disco
(headlight disco)

Oh oh oh oh
To a headlight disco
(headlight disco)

Oh oh oh oh
To a headlight disco
(headlight disco)

(headlight disco)
(keep your eyes on the road)
(headlight disco)

(headlight disco)
(keep your eyes on the road)
(headlight disco)

(headlight disco)
