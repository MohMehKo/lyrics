There's a highway
But it ain't gonna get you there
There's a distance
What you see and what you hear
Somewhere inside of that mind
That's only yours

You gotta be crazy
Til the world comes crawlin' back
They gotta see it
Til they believe it
And the band's been wonderin'
Lately
How to make this freedom last
So give her all the love you have
Til the world comes crawlin' back

Well there's a right way
But it ain't gonna make a change
Then it's a big bad drought
But it don't mean it can't rain
Cause somewhere up high in the sky
In the clouds there's a chance

You gotta be crazy
Til the world comes crawlin' back
They gotta see it
Til they believe it
And the band's been wonderin'
Lately
How to make this freedom last
So give her all the love you have
Til the world comes crawlin'

Sweet song you never know
It's the strangest place
That you thought you'd never go
It was a paradigm shift
When you thought the world was bland
They said that you'd be lyin' til the ship came back
It's a new feud against gravity
And it never made sense til it fell out of a tree
It's the one percent, a new president
Cause it's you and me, me and you

You gotta be
You gotta be

You gotta be crazy
Til the world comes crawlin' back
They gotta see it
Til they believe it
And the band's been wonderin'
Lately
How to make this freedom last
So give her all the love you have
Til the world comes crawlin' back

And the world came crawlin' back
And the world came crawlin' back
And the world came crawlin' back
And the world came
