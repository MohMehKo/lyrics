I dream all day
Till I am free
The clock is slow 
I'm in overload 
But I'd rather take it easy
It's school all week
Till I get home

Just you and me some great TV
Feeling good just like we should

Can't wake on Monday
It's to tough on Tuesday
And in Wednesday I'm in overtime
Just get in by on Thursday
I'll be fine on Friday
When can we let the fun begin
Tune it on the weekend
