I woke you up before
You had the chance to dream
You almost missed the dance
But never skipped a beat

You never could admit
We've had a history
Your friends would throw a fit
So you had to smuggle me

Don't give up
I won't give up on you
I've been loyal without having something to prove
I'm not a killer
I'm just killing your doubts

Don't you know that
I'll be here forever
Even if you leave
And if you look for something better
Soon you'll see
That you're addicted to me

The guilt is all on you
But I'm easier to blame
But I can still relieve
Your ordinary pain

Don't give up
I won't give up on you
I've been loyal without having something to prove
I'm not a killer
I'm just killing your doubts

Don't you know that
I'll be here forever
Even if you leave
And if you look for something better
Soon you'll see
That you're addicted

You can love, you can lust, you can use me
All you want
You can lie, you can trust, you confuse me

I'll be here forever
Even if you leave
And if you look for something better
Soon you'll see
That you're addicted

I'll be here forever
Even if you leave
And if you look for something better
Soon you'll see
That you're addicted to me
That you're addicted to me
That you're addicted to me
That you're addicted to me
