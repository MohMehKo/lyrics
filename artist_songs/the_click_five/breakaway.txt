When you're waiting,
When you're holding on,
And you lose your grip,
The feeling's gone.

So you find out,
That you had it wrong.
Can you breakaway?
It's been so long.

Feelin' now,
The more you let it go.
More your heart,
Stands alone.
Hear it out,
'Cause it's building up,
And you had enough,
To finally say 
You know that it's okay.
And you breakaway.

Like an old friend,
And seek and guess.
'Cause I know the end.
I know the rest.

Feelin' now,
The more you let it go.
More your heart,
Stands alone.
Hear it out,
'Cause it's building up,
And you had enough,
To finally say 
You know that it's okay.
(Know that it's okay)

And I'm waking up,
(Breakaway)
And I got the stamps
To break, breakaway.
Breakaway

Feelin' now,
The more you let it go.
More your heart,
Stands alone.
(Ohoho)
Hear it out,
'Cause it's building up,
And you had enough,
To finally say 
You know that it's okay.
And you breakaway.
Breakaway.
Breakaway.
