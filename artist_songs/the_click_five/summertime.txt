On the boardwalk
Working two shifts
Saving for that diamond ring
Then I'll quit
All the cool kids
Hanging south pier
Guess I'll have it figured out by next year

Summertime summertime
You do it to me
Everytime summertime
You do it to me
Oh
I'm restless
Oh
Defenseless
Oh I can feel it
Baby is it real or is it just a sign
It's summertime

On the weekend
Got my ink done
Took my baby for a ride
in the sun
Left the boardwalk
On my four wheels
Now we're blasting down the shore and we feel

Summertime summertime
You do it to me
Everytime summertime
You do it to me
Oh
I'm restless
Oh
Defenseless
Oh I can feel it
Baby is it real or is it just a sign
It's summertime

Summertime summertime
You do it to me
Everytime summertime
You do it to me
Oh
I'm restless
Oh
Defenseless
Oh I can feel it
Baby is it real or is it just a sign
I'm restless
Oh
Defenseless
Oh I can feel it
Baby is it real or is it just a sign
It's summertime
