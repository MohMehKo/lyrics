Was it you
That said that she could never get enough of me
But you confessed
That when we were alone you had to tell yourself to breathe
So maybe I
Should feel a little more like I've been living in a dream
Well I'm asking you should I stay

Even though I love you
(I can't help thinking about if I'd be better without you)
If we stay together
(it could get worse, then again, maybe it could get better)
Even though I love you
(I can't help thinking about if I'd be better without you)
Somethings wrong we both know
That you and I still got a long way to go

Why would you?
Wanna be with me instead of other guys
Oh make me feel
Like something special
God I think I've heard a million times
So would it be enough
To buy you everything and call you mine
'Cause it won't last long if I do

Even though I love you
(I can't help thinking about if I'd be better without you)
If we stay together
(it could get worse, then again, maybe it could get better)
Even though I love you
(I can't help thinking about if I'd be better without you)
Somethings wrong we both know
That you and I still got a long way to go

If I would leave tomorrow
You'd be the last to know

Even though I love you
If we stay together

Even though I love you
(I can't help thinking about if I'd be better without you)
If we stay together
(it could get worse, then again, maybe it could get better)
Even though I love you
(I can't help thinking about if I'd be better without you)
Somethings wrong we both know
That you and I still got a long..long way to go

Long way to go
Long way to go
Still got a long way to go
