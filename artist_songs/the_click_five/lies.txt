You told me you loved me
So I dont understand
Why promises are snapped in two
And words are made to burn

The bigger the better
Some stolen from Japan
Collected from around the world
They'll catch you if they can

Lies Lies Lies 
Yeah
Lies Lies Lies 
Yeah
Lies Lies Lies 
Yeah
Lies Lies Lies 
Yeah

Do I have to catch you out
To know whats on your mind
Well Cleopatra died for egypt
What a waste of time

The white ones the red ones
And some you cant disguise
The twisted twos that have the news
Cant hide it in your eyes

Lies Lies Lies 
Yeah
Lies Lies Lies 
Yeah
Lies Lies Lies 
Yeah
Lies Lies Lies 
Yeah

Oh you know I know

You say you'll try harder
But I think its just too late
Well the car is reving in the drive
And Im not the sort to wait

The bigger the better
So make them all Sigone
Collected from around the world
Love lies on and on and on and on and on

Lies Lies Lies 
Yeah
(they're gonna get you)
Lies Lies Lies 
Yeah
(they wont forget you)
Lies Lies Lies 
Yeah
(oh they're gonna get you)
Lies Lies Lies

Oh you know I know
