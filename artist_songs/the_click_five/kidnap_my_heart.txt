Hey girl, what's your name?
I think I caught you looking my way
Do you wanna know how to get me all to your own

Weekends work the best
I'll pick the place you do the rest
Hey now don't be shy but you got to keep me in line

Love at first sight never thought it could happen to me
But you made me believe

Kidnap my heart
And take me with you
Kidnap my heart
Make my dreams come true
Take me away
Cause falling in love ain't very far
Not far from the start
Kidnap my heart.

Can you get me up?
More fun I can ever dream of
Could you tie me down?
Can you keep me hanging around?

I don't wanna be here to keep you company
Put your hand in mine
Better hold on tight for the ride

Love at first sight never thought it could happen to me
But you made me believe

Kidnap my heart
And take me with you
Kidnap my heart
Make my dreams come true
Take me away
Cause falling in love ain't very far
Not far from the start
Kidnap my heart.

You've got to hold me tighter
I'm a real fighter
Don't tear us apart

Love at first sight never thought it could happen to me
But you made me believe
You made me believe, believe, believe

Kidnap my heart
And take me with you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Kidnap my heart
Make my dreams come true
(You make my dreams come true)
Take me away
Cause falling in love ain't very far
(Ain't very far)
Not far from the start
Kidnap my heart.

Kidnap my heart
Kidnap my heart....
