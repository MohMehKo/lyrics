I'm not all here
and that's a hard place to be
when your arms, they won't let go of me
so I hold you back,
it's all i know how to do
when your love falls down with you

I picked it up
and made it look just like new
and we made it last, like long we do
Till it ran out
and we were left without
someone to run to

Oh, I'm willing to try
but finding out that I'm not playing the games you're saying we should play
and now it's clear
that we're still hoping
these doors will open to our love, our time, our space
to our love, our time, our space

when I'm away
chasing down restless nights
savin up my love to keep for us
but it slips through,
never to be held again
empty hands can't be for you

Oh, I'm willing to try
but finding out that I'm not playing the games you're saying we should play
and now it's clear
that we're still hoping
these doors will open to our love, our time, our space
to our love, our time, our space

will come when it does,
calling for us

Oh, are you ready to see
I'm waiting to try
but finding that I'm not playin the games you're saying we should play
and now it's clear
that we're still hoping
these doors will open to our love, our time, our space
open to our love, our time, our space

to our love, our time, our space
to our love
to our love, our time, our space
