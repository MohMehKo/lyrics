She's got her name on the A-list everywhere
Nobody knows where she came from
No one cares

Cause she's a Poptart
Slash movie star
Get the picture?
Hey hey hey
Look out U.S.A

She's got vanity in her veins
Blue blood don't mean a thing
She waves a backstage pass
Where nothing's for free
She's American, American, royalty

She's spending millions on her trust-fund to be seen
She's on the cover of her favorite magazine

Bubblegum type
Slash socialite
Could it be accident
Next thing,
She'll be president

She's got vanity in her veins
Blue blood don't mean a thing
She waves a backstage pass
Where nothing's for free
She's American, American, royalty

Here's the end of story but the madness don't stop
Records sales have fallen and TV shows flop
People dry your eyes, she don't need your sympathy
She's American-

Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey

She's got vanity in her veins
Blue blood don't mean a thing
She waves a backstage pass
Where nothing's for free
She's American royalty

She's got vanity in her veins
Blue blood don't mean a thing
She waves a backstage pass
Where nothing's for free
She's American, American, royalty
