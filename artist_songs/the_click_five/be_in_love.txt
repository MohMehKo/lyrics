It's like my magic
And when you have it
It blows your mind
You're feeling alright
You've read a chapter
With ever after
And so you say
That's what it takes to

Be in love
I could get used to this
Be in love
There'll be a heart
I'll put you in it

[Chorus]
Cuz everybody, everybody wants to be in love
Be in love
Cuz everybody, everybody wants to be in love
Be in love

I drank a potion
I took a motion
And you appeared
Came outta nowhere
Hallucination
Imagination
And make believe
You gotta be

Be in love
I could get used to this
Be in love
Just tell the time that we're not in it

[Chorus]
Cuz everybody, everybody wants to be in love
Be in love, Oooh
It takes forever, but we're never gonna give it up
Be in love

Whoa-whoa

Cuz everybody, everybody wants to be in love
Be in love, Oooh
It takes forever, but we're never gonna give it up
Be in love

Whoa

Cuz everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody (wants to be in love, be in love)
Wants to be in love, Oh-oh
Cuz everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody (wants to be in love, be in love)
Wants to be in love
