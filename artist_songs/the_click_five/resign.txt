I wanna be your hollywood
I could be your movie star
You misunderstood
Who you really think you are
I wanna be your dollar bills
I could be your shopping mall
I'll be your diet pills
I won't stand to watch you fall

Resign
Resign those wondrin' eyes
and wake up to my love
tonight

Don't wanna be your plastic doll
I feel like I'm caught up in a race
You can't break the fall
I won't let you go to waste
You wanna be designer clothes
It's a lame conspiracy
Your routine overdose
It doesn't mean a thing to me

Resign
Resign those wondrin' eyes
and wake up to my love
Resign
(Won't you resign)
Resign Those wondrin' eyes
and wake up to my love
Tonight

Resign
(Won't you)
Resign Those wondrin' eyes
(Those wondrin' eyes)
(Won't you resign)
and wake up to my love

Resign
(Won't you resign)
Resign those wondrin' eyes
and wake up to my love

Resign
(Won't you resign)
Resign those wondrin' eyes
(won't you resign)
and wake up to my love
tonight
