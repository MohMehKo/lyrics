It could have been something
Something into nothing
Thatâ€™s just the way it goes
And everybody knows

Starting flying this way
Arrows through a heart shape
That's just the way it goes
And everybody knows [x2]
That's just the way it goes

Driving down the highway
Living on a heart ache
That's just the way it goes
And everybody knows

Dreaming of your best thoughts
Dying for the small talk
That's just the way it goes
And everybody knows [x2]
That's just the way it goes

First time, just a quick run through
Next time, when you're gonna get to
Slow down
Do ya hurry up
And move on to another round

Next time, better than the first time
Last time, better than the next time
Sunsets, fade to black
And you know
That's just the way it goes [x3]

First time, just a quick run through
Next time, when you're gonna get to
Slow down
Do ya hurry up
And move on to another round

That's just the way it goes [x2]
