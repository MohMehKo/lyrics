Never had to work a day
In a perfect life
Never had a bill to pay
It seems to work just fine

I know, I know
I shouldn't go
Go there
I know, I know
I know she don't
Don't care

And if she even had a heart
At least she'd play it cool
But she don't even have to start
To follow any rules

I know, I know
I shouldn't go
Go there
I know, I know
I know she don't
Don't care

And if she wants to mess it up
She does, just because

When she walks in, she breaks her heart
Like no, no, no, nobody's business
Makes the whole world fall apart
Like no, no, no, nobody's business
I wanna, wanna make her mine
But it's j-j-just a matter of time
Til she goes and breaks my heart
Like no, no, no, nobody's business
Nobody's business

She's like an '80's movie
Darker than you think
And she can see right through me
She's prettier in pink

I know, I know
I shouldn't go
Go there
I know, I know
I know she don't
Don't care

And if she wants to mess me up
She does, just because

When she walks in, she breaks your heart
Like no, no, no, nobody's business
Makes the whole world fall apart
Like no, no, no, nobody's business
I wanna, wanna make her mine
But it's j-j-just a matter of time
Til she goes and breaks my heart
Like no, no, no, nobody's business

Eh, eh, eh
What's on your mind, girl?
Eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh

What, what, what's on her mind
Nobody's gonna get inside
No, (won't you let me in), no, cause it's nobody's business

When she walks in, she breaks her heart
Like no, no, no, nobody's business
Makes the whole world fall apart
Like no, no, no, nobody's business
I wanna, wanna make her mine
But it's j-j-just a matter of time
Til she goes and breaks my heart
Like no, no, no, nobody's business
Til she goes and breaks my heart
Like no, no, no, nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business
No, no, no, nobody's business
