"I got a cell phone, trampoline, a year's worth of magazine
I even got a new pair of chucks
I got a surfboard, swimming pool, a Mustang convertible
Still I didn't get enough

I got everything I wanted on my list
Except for one thing that I missed
(Just a kiss) 

My girlfriend forgot me this Christmas day...

I got her earrings, chocolate, spa gift certificates
Waited a couple hours in line
I got her makeup, teddy bears, even bought her underwear
Now I'm down to my last dime 

She got everything she wanted on her list
Except for one thing that she missed
(Just a kiss)
My girlfriend forgot me this Christmas day
