They say you left it in the sand
Gave it to a man
Where's it gonna go
When the wind blows

In his house of show and tell
Visions in the well
Gotta have weight
Levee's gonna break

I see something you don't see
I see something you don't see
Yeah, when every fire's burnin' down
Get your bones up off the ground
I see something you don't see
(Fever for shakin')
Don't you give it to me

Told the doctor where it hurts
Steppin' off the earth
Garden on the moon
Grown into bloom

Fed your river to the fog
Threw it to the dogs
Spirit in your soul
Gotta let it roll, roll

I see something you don't see
(Oohoo, fever for shakin')
I see something you don't see
(Oohoo, fever for shakin')
Yeah, when every fire's burnin' down
Get your bones up off the ground
I see something you don't see
(Fever for shakin')
Gotta give it to me

I'm just rollin' Mississippi down to Delta Bay
Oh, but I could never change ya
Shakin' with your wicked ways
So I ate your medication for breakfast
Ate your medication for breakfast
I ate your medication for breakfast
Ate your medication for breakfast
Just to feel like you

I see something you don't see
(Oohoo, fever for shakin')
I see something you don't see
(Oohoo, fever for shakin')
Yeah, when every fire's burnin' down
Get your bones up off the ground
I see something you don't see
(Fever for shakin')
Don't you give it to me

Oohoo ooh ooh hoo hoo hoo

(You gotta give it to me)
(Fever for shakin')?
