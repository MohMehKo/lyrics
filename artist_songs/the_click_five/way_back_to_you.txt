I tried to let you go
I went out all alone
Took everything I own
Nothin' to make me turn around
I watch the sky grow dark
Learned names of all the stars
Woke up to the sounds of cars
Sayin' goodbye to one more town
I ran from here until I couldn't anymore
And some how I keep appearin' at your door

I can't help findin' my way
No, I can't help findin' my way
I can't help findin' my way
Way back to you

I met somebody else
Not doin' like yourself
Felt like I might as well
God knows there's no one else around
When I start thinkin' about if she could be the one
I end up wonderin' what we could've done

I can't help findin' my way
No, I can't help findin' my way
I can't help findin' my way
Way back to you
Way back to you

I don't know what I would do
If you told me I'm too late now

Some endings throw you off
Sometimes your thoughts go wrong
Maybe I just belong
Right here where I was runnin' from

I can't help findin' my way
No, I can't help findin' my way
I can't help findin' my way
Way back to you
I can't help findin' my way
No, I can't help findin' my way
I can't help findin' my way
Way back to you
Way back to you
Whoa
My way back to you
