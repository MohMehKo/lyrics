[Hook]
Yo we comin' what you want and
Shake your little somethin' somethin'
Stop your frontin' roll that blunt and
Spark it up like getting nothin'

[Smilez (Southstar)]
Oh, oh (Uh, uh)
Oh, oh (Uh, uh)
Oh, oh (Uh, uh)

Just another Bow!
Just another Bow!
Just another Bow!

[Southstar]
Go ahead andenjoy yourself, enjoy the shine
Enjoy it now in a minute this will all be mine
No runways, fuck it i'm crashin' in
Top performer catch me on ESPN
Open the gates and doors, let the games begin
Givin' it up yeah cause I spike the gin
Party all week Sunday confess my sins
Wake up on Monday, ya be at it again
From now on call me the water, I got it on lock
I'm like Jackie in Rush Hour stealin' your glock
Storm through the club gettin' followed by flocks
Cats losin' their eyes like peepin' the rocks
I'm movin' it fast TV's up in the dash
Step out the whip instantly surrounded by ass
Anyone who thinks I ain't gon' last
Pop shit, and i'ma throw you right through the glass

[Chorus]
We crash the party
We crash the party

We crash the party

Fuck everybody we crash the party
We crash the party
We crash the party
We crash the party
Fuck everybody we crash the party

[Smilez]
First we crash the club and crash the bar
Then we crash your broad that's for sure
See I use a skyhook and storm [?]
They callin' me the eskareem lose your bar
Crush and line now let's make it clear
I will thug it out to a black tire fair
Oh folks, like keep it down caude my music lives
I'm the reason granny [?]
I drop this like a [?] make it live
Smoke all your weed sorry dog fun at salivia
Money how I think not money a liar
I grag an A&R and slap at up side of ya
This industry crashin' in at all angles
Built gon' where the bullet by try angles
We smokin' it up, coughin' it up, drinkin' it up
You know Smilez stay trashin' it up

[Chorus]

[Hook 2x]

[Southstar]
Rip your shirts off and let me see you raise it up
Spark the L let me see ya blaze it up
Player what, i'm lampin' deep in the cut
VIP 100 girls and they all get stuck
Pull up to the club face on the side of the bus
And if they want a hype crowd play this is a must
Let me tell ya the industry ain't ready for us
We like Russian Roulete and ya out of luck

[Smilez]
I'm quick to bust your shit
Sucka now you know this
Smilez leavin' with your shit
Gettin' back is hopeless
Crashin' it house parties the bar [?]
Tracks like this maybe start a [?]
The raw kid that had got you reception
That had you bride on her knees confessin' your brides maids addressin'
Smilez what it is get your hands up
Throw your fist and wild out if you feelin' it

[Chorus 2x]
