[Smilez]
Yo this is Smilez and South-Stigga with just say no
We gon' kill y'all with this vernacular flow, for sho'
We about to blow and leave out all y'all windows
Cop the new coupe and traded all y'all old Pintos
FiFi's fabric acid, it's so simple, yeah

[Chorus: x4 with ad-libs]
We keep it gully
We keep it gully
We keep it gully
Gully, gully, gully

[Verse 1: Southstar]
I'm so grimey, I keep y'all behind me
Spit so raw I'll make y'all rewind me
Just to learn the song, just to rap along
I'm like Mills Lane, ready to get it on
I'ma prove a point, listen to the joint
Only hot shit, I don't ever disappoint
And even with that cheedar, I keep it so gutter
And even with the pressure, man I won't stutter
Yo this ain't no joke, I'll make ya speak in smoke
If ya get to close give ya a heat stroke
See it's my time, can't take the shine
And when I'm done with this they buildin' me a shrine
So in the meantime make this game mine
I got enough rhymes to last a lifetime
So I'ma keep goin' ain't no way of slowin' me down
Cause you know Southstar'll keep flowin'

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Smilez]
You know the flow sick, know this, Smilez focus
Drop sixteen and ya man's foldin'
Burpin' after I eat him for din-din
And look at his boys, they like I'm not with him
Yo Smilez keep it gully up in the Lex buggy
With ma rubbin' my tummy and suckin' babies from me
And girls real funny not understandin' my mack
I'm not Jordan, once I'm done with you there's no comin' back
Keep my hat tucked low anywhere I choose to go
Wanna meet my dough, first meet my fo-fo
Cause niggaz act sour when they around ya
But bullets like aliens, don't catch a close encounter
Rhymes you can bet, keep 'em fat nothin' less
Put this in ya face and you'll catch a cardiac arrest
Who cares how dope you is or who you rollin' with
You can't touch a hair on my chinny-chin chin, BITCH!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Smilez & Southstar]
Hey yo we straight out the O, O-Town, just so you know
It's mister Smi-dow and it's South-Stizzo
In the Lex and the Benz, and we comin through slow
Ridin' on dubs, chicks like there they go
With a pinwheel cap and a throwback jersey
Dude need to bring his youth back cause they mercky
Girls love Smilez he a freak Kirspy
And I got the whole world beggin' me mercy
Techs so raw y'all don't want no more
We in it to win it you know that's for sure
And this is just the begginin' we got more in store
We gon' kick in the door big style on you dog
We gon' buy out the mall, cause another storm
If they do cop another one and that's our law
And my words is bionic, y'all nigga don't want it
Have you red, white, and blue make you patriotic

[Chorus]
