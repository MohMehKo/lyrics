"I can kill standing still - it's easy
I can scare with a stare - it's easy"
Hey Ringo, it's sad though
Because it's hard to walk tall when you're small
Whether dressed in disciplined style, nevermind
When you're small you walk as if you're falling

"I attack from the back - because it's easy
And I can assail while wearing very nice jewellery"
Oh, hey Ringo, it's sad though
Because it's hard to walk tall when you're small
Whether dressed in disciplined style, nevermind
When you're small you spend your life crawling

"I burst into public bars
and I throw my weight around
And no one can even see me
No one can even see me
Nobody can see me
No one can see me"

"Success is just a mess!"
Oh, hey Gringo, it's sad though
because it's hard to walk tall when you're small
whether dressed in disciplined style, nevermind
when you're small you're bound to look appalling

"So compadre, please do this for me
Compadre, please weep for me
Compadre, compadre
Please, weep for me"
