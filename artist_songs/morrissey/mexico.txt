In Mexico
I went for a walk to inhale
the tranquil, cool, lover's air
but I could taste a trace
of American chemical waste
And the small voice said
"What can we do?"

In Mexico
I went for a walk to inhale
the tranquil, cool, lover's air
but I could sense the hate
from the Lone Star state
And a small voice said
"What can we do?"

It seems if you're rich and you're white
you'll be alright
I just don't see why
this should be so
If you're rich and you're white
you'll be alright
I just don't see why
this should be so

In Mexico
I lay on the grass
and I cried my heart out
for want of my love
Oh, for want of my love
Oh, for want of my love

It seems if you're rich and you're white
you think you're so right
I just don't see why
this should be so
If you're rich and you're white
then you'll be OK
I just don't see why
this should be so

In Mexico
I lay on the grass
and I cried my heart out
for want of my love
For want of my love
For want of my love
For want of my love
