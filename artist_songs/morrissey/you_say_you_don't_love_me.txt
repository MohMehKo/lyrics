You say you don't love me
Well that's alright with me 'cos I'm in love with you
(And) I wouldn't want you to do things
That you don't want to do
You know I always wanted you
To be in love with me
But I think I realize at last
The way things have to be 
I wanted to live in a dream that couldn't be real
And I think you understand the way (that) I feel 
You say you don't
You say you don't

You say you don't love me
Well that's alright with me 'cos I have got the time
To hang around and hope that maybe
You'll change your mind
I'm determined not to make the same mistake
This time around
Because I've had my share of heartache
I've been thinking and I've found
I don't want to live in a dream I want something real
And I think you understand this feeling I feel 
You say you don't
You say you don't
You say...

You say you don't
You say you don't
You say you don't love me
Well that's alright with me I'm not in love with you 
(But) I just want us to do the things
That we both want to do
Yes I have this special feeling 
I was wrong to call it love
Because the word entails a few things
I would be wary of
I have no need to live in a dream it's finally real 
And I think I understand this feeling I feel 
You say you don't
You say you don't
You say you don't love me
You say you don't love me
You say you don't love me
Mmm
