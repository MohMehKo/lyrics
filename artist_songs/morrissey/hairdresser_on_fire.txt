Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME
