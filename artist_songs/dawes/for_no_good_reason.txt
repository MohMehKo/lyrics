A little girl sinks down in the deep end 
and looks up towards the sky, 
and through a little blue world of legs 
and her feet that look like their in flight 
in a slow motion dance while the water expands 
the Sun's refracted light 
she just has to pretend she can hear the music

When she starts crying in her goggles 
the scene becomes unclear 
but she keeps peering into this underworld 
through the filter of her tears 
which let her keep hold of the moment 
as if it was a souvenir 
she just has to pretend she knows how to use it

Or maybe it's the cold hard truth that makes her cry
Maybe it's her ancient past life memories come
Maybe it's a chemical that got into her eye
Or maybe it's for no good reason at all
Maybe it's for no good reason at all

His wife asked "How were things at work today?" 
as Bill walked through the door 
and put his coat on the chair and his keys on the table 
and his eyes down on the floor, 
and he tightened his jaws and he thought of the cause 
and effects weren't clear anymore, 
figuring out how to say what's wrong

He said "I know that I'll be leaving you, 
that's all I really know, 
but I wish I could tell what exactly compels 
me to turn my steps and go, 
because there's so much love that you've given me, 
and so much love that I owe, 
it's with myself that I can't seem to get along"

Or maybe he just felt the hungry hand of fate
Maybe he won't rest until he's seen it fall
Maybe it's that mood that he's in just for the day
Or maybe it's for no good reason at all
Maybe it's for no good reason at all

An actor was found dead today in his Culver city home, 
and with no evidence of foul play it seemed he'd acted on his own, 
the position of his body looked like he was reaching for the phone, 
makes you wonder who he was gonna call

Maybe all his demons were settling their debts
Or maybe all the pressure finally drove him to the wall
Maybe there were secrets that he needed to protect
Or maybe it's for no good reason at all
Maybe it's for no good reason, 
no good reason, no good reason at all
