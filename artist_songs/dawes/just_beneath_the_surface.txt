Have you ever thought your little girl glamour shots
And the events of that whole day spent at the mall
Is maybe a part of you you didn't know you were clinging to?
As if that's where the secret had taken its hold most of all
Like a feather that finds its invisible path as its fall

Just beneath the surface there's another one of me
At the root of all my trouble, in the twitch before I speak
With thoughts and revelations even I could not accept
So just beneath the surface is where he will stay kept

When you talk about me, do you stick to the memories?
Or was I just another victim of the case?
The one that went cold on you the way it was meant to do
For any detective that hasn't accepted his place
And still wanders a city in hopes of it showing its face

Just beneath the surface there's another one of me
At the root of all my trouble, in the twitch before I speak
With thoughts and revelations even I could not accept
So just beneath the surface is where he will stay kept

Between the thoughtless words and the wordless thoughts
Between my plotless fears and my fearless plots
Between the parts of me I keep from you and the things that I'm just not
The center keeps on drifting
The music never stops

Just beneath the surface there's another one of me
At the root of all my trouble, in the twitch before I speak
With thoughts and revelations even I could not accept
Just beneath the surface is where he will stay kept
