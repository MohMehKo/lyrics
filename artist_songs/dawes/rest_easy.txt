There’s a place in my heart
Where you can always be found
However long you’ve been gone
Or however far away I happen to be bound,
And even though I only hear you in the whispers
I take a deep breath and I listen to that sound,
‘Cause there’s a place in my heart 
Where you can always be found.

There’s a place in my heart
Where I will always wait,
Like the mother of a sailor
Who spends her time sitting by the waves
And the time it takes to work out your intentions
However small or how great
There’s a place in my heart
Where I can always wait.

And on the day that you return
Because your feelings get confirmed,
And you search my face for the changes that it lacks,
I hope this broken heart is healed
And that you definitely feel 
That it was worth the time apart to come on back

There’s a place in my heart
Where you should always feel loved
However alone you end up feeling
Or however small you think the world has become,
Because even though the devil got his way
And stole that future we got very little of
There’s a place in my heart 
Where you should always feel loved.
