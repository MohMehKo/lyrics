And when the singing is through
There's not much else I can do for you
Which might be more than what you'd want
But less than you'd expect

From a coded dream
From a final scene
Where all the heroes and villains intersect
And that lost feeling through the credits feels correct

Just beneath the surface, there's another one of her
The one I'm taking with me, the one that I prefer
After all her reasons, but right before she left
Just beneath the surface is where she will stay kept

Just beneath the surface
Just beneath the surface
