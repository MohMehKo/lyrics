From the paper umbrellas in both of our drinks
To the shadows that walk without us
My account of the details is as clear as you'd think
Kept up by friends that still ask about us

If our lives were a movie, if our lives were a book
It'd be longer than I'd recommend
'Cause if you're telling a story, at some point you stop
But stories don't end

The remains of a person, the habits of a ghost
You could still find in the places you used to
Still reading off cue cards and raising a toast
To the stories I still tell about you

But the plot line wanders and versions change
And I don't know where to quit

If I tried to show every side of you through words of a song
I'd say a fraction of what I'd intend
'Cause if you're telling a story, at some point you stop
But stories don't end

The next time I see you and my conscience tells me
That the episode has long since been closed
But he's not the one that gets up every morning
And wonders how long a memory keeps its pose
And how much that the man beside you knows
And how much of the toll it's taken shows

Like a famous singer that lost his voice
That we all still want to meet

If our lives were a movie, if our lives were a book
It'd be longer than I could defend
'Cause if you're telling a story, at some point you stop
But stories don't end
Stories don't end

They go on and on
Just someone stops listening
