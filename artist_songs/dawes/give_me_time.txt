Give me time.
Give me time.
If there's one thing you could give
to help me show you all that's mine,
give me time. 

Show me love.
Show me love.
If there's one thing that you know
that I've not had any of,
show me love. 

Help me see.
Help me see. 
If you know what it would take
to find the patience that you need,
help me see.

Give me time. 
Give me time.
If there's one thing you could give
to help me show you all that's mine, 
give me time. 

Oh oh oh oh oh
