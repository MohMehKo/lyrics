If you’re just asking for a reason
Reasons are everywhere you look
The only difference between them
Are which you gave and which you took

Every smile with some dark anticipation
And dreams of back before it settled in their brows
I don’t remember when you first began to notice
But I can’t think about it now
I can’t think about it now

The latest singer’s latest single’s got me listening
For the pact between the writer and the star
This is how mythology is written
This is where the lawless jungles are

She’s just a singer living mostly after midnight
Pumping blood and money back into a town
And it all eventually betrays her
But I can’t think about it now
I can’t think about it now

So I guess it makes me wonder what I’m chasing
Like a dancer when she’s breaking in her shoes
Like sending men up to the moon just for the landing
Displaying power we don’t know how else to use

Sometimes it’s more than I can handle
Sometimes it’s all the joy I’ve found
And it’ll all end up on one side or the other
But I can’t think about it now

The decades that are hidden in the sidewalks
The narrative that naturally occurs
The everlasting wisdom of a sports bar
The poison that’s mistaken for a cure

All these backward glances putting me in danger
Of forgetting how to turn myself around
It’s just that time just keeps on slipping through my fingers
But I can’t think about it now
I can’t think about it now
I can’t think about it now

I can’t think about it now
