Take me out of the city
Where my shadow can roam
Let me breathe in the morning
Let my way be my home

Take me out of the city
True love I will not find
Take me in new one's heart
Take me out of my mind

I feel my reflection slide
Along the eyes that march me past
I found my direction high up, close to sun
That I've kept to my back

Take me out of the city
Where God's never been
Where my soul is my sorrow
And it's bound by my skin

Take me out of the city
May I never return
Let the song of the mountain
Be the one that I've earned

I feel my reflection slide
Along the eyes that march me past
I found my direction high up, close to sun
That I've kept to my back

Take me out of the city
Where my shadow can roam
Let me breathe in the morning
Let my way be my home
