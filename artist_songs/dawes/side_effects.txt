If there was no word for love now
We'd see how strong it really is
We could find out what it looks like
Or if it ever did exist

'Cause every time you said you loved me
Seems like the point escaped us both
And the current interrupted
The moment that you spoke

Now there's a loophole in the theory
That I cannot figure out
'Cause if love was what they said it would be
Then you'd be here with me now

It's a loneliness perfected
It's how to laugh when you should cry
The side effects of broken promise
Becomes a way of getting by

So the next time that you see me
And our exchange feels somehow cheap
Know that I feel every word you're saying
But from just a few steps out of reach

Where the view is a little hazy
And the noise a little loud
'Cause if love was what they said it would be
Well then you'd be here with me now

If love was what they said it would be
Then you'd be here with me now
