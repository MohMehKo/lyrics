Ohh ohh ohhh
Ohh ohh ohhh
Ohh ohh ohhh

If these walls could talk
I'd defer to the furniture
The piano, the table, the bed that we both sleep in
These constant, silent messengers

'Cause there's a story that's recorded in each fingerprint
That these disregarded artifacts collect
And if we boil down these documented memories
I have a feeling you should know what to expect

You were right on time
And out of nowhere
Right on time

Ohh ohh ohhh
And if they don't talk
I'll investigate a formula
Figures, equations, the details of our union
The edges of the nebula

At the end of such a long and worthy sacrifice
All that's left is to submit my full report
I'll have turned all of my hunches into certainties
And I will confirm what I already knew before

That you were right on time
And out of nowhere
Right on time

Ohh ohh ohhh

And as I stumble through the streets back from the alleyways
And everyone can see I'm bleeding through my shirt
And after describing all the shooter's details carefully,
And I start to realize just how badly I've been hurt

You were right on time
And out of nowhere
You were right on time

Right on time
And out of nowhere
Right on time
