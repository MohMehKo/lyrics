When your restlessness has lost it’s way
And you’re finished with your need to stray
It’s not even something I am proud to say
I’ll be waiting for your call

When you reach the other side of this life you live
And you ask yourself what good you did
When you wanna know just how much I can forgive
I’ll be waiting for your call

When the charms and riches do not seem to last
When your lover asked for proof is not up to the task
I’m surprised you think you even need to ask
I’ll be waiting for your call

I’ll be here as I’ve always been
For you to think of on your way
The same way stepping into the evening
Is the time to praise the day

May I never give in and accept the fact
If I can’t feel your presence let me feel the lack
‘Cause even if you never will be coming back
I’ll be waiting for your call
Even if you never will be coming back
I’ll be waiting for your call
