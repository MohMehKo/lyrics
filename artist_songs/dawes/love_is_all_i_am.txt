I need a silent, true way to admire,
like you as a sunset and I as a wildfire.
And I can't let the day go.

I've locked up these words in fear that I'd say them wrong.
Is it love as a mountain, or love as a simple song?
And the moment that the two meet
has now laid itself at your feet.

And love is not convenient. 
It does not cease at your command.
You might take and leave it,
but love is all I am.
Love is all I am.

I need a boundless, soft way to commend,
like you as a temper and I as its tender end.
And however long your fits last,
I will live within your shadow cast.

And love is still your stranger.
It does not respect how much you'll stand.
You might be love's reminder,
but love is all I am.
Love is all I am.

I need a graceful, proud way to let go,
to smile and accept the things that you don't know.
The losses and the gains blurred
the weight of these as last words.

And love is not excitement.
It's not kissing or holding hands.
I'm not some assignment,
no, love is all I am.
Love is all I am.
Love is all I am.
