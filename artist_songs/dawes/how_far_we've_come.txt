Stars, please shine the way for me
Show the one that I have followed
To see how far I've come

Sun that slowly sets on me
Be the same to rise tomorrow
To see how far I've come

These are the days we swore upon
So barman keep the TV on
To see how far we've come

Peak to peak and shore to shore
This is all love was ever for
Is to see how far we've come

California's greenest parts
I reach out for my brother
To see how far he's come

For the girl that came to break my heart
I call on her new lover
To see how far she's come

Why your mother keeps a record of her child's height
Why we all are here tonight
Is to see how far we've come

The only point of clocks and maps
The only point of looking back
Is to see how far we've come

Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh

Stars, please shine the way for me
Show the one that I have followed
To see how far I've come

And sun that slowly sets on me
Be the same to rise tomorrow
To see how far I've come
