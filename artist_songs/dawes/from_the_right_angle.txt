You have found me on the other side of a loser's winning streak
Where my thoughts all wander further than they should
Let me sing to you my solitude, let me pay for your next drink
Let me defend these hearts which are so rarely understood

From the right angle, in the right light
I might seem like I could take care of you
For a brief moment, for a few nights
Until the changing world has tumbled back into view

When nothing really matters the world gets harder to resist
And saves you a place at the end of an empty glass
I am here as a reminder, the quick glance off of a cliff
I guess that's why I though you would never ask

From the right angle, in the right light
I might seem like I could take care of you
For a brief moment, for a few nights
Until the changing world has tumbled back into view

At the scene of all I've left unlearned, in the directions to your house
In every swing I took to crack the code
I need a cold beer from a dressing room, I need a string of dates back out
I think there are a few of us that still belong out on the road

From the right angle, in the right light
I might seem like I could take care of you
For a brief moment, for a few nights
Until the changing world has tumbled back into view

Until all you want is all I know how to do
I might seem like I could take care of you
