All my mornings start with the alarm clock
Every dream gets stopped before the end
And with each bit I remember, the more the details run together
And I'm left with a message I don't comprehend
I've lost contact with the great beyond again

And as I stare over my breakfast and out into the street
I find that sorrow I've been chasing way too often,
That the man that stands in front of you is not the sum of all his dreams,
But I'm hoping they've got something in common
I'm hoping they've got somethings in common

The way that love attacks and then surrenders
The things I mean the most when I say her name
And if he ever speaks of me casually, I hope he does so carefully
'Cause when you've loved somebody, everything's to blame
And I don't want her to ever feel ashamed

But all my best kept secrets are the one's I didn't know I had
So I couldn't even tell her if I wanted
That the way that she remembers me is not the way I really am
But I'm hoping they've got something in common
I'm hoping they've got something in common

So I feel like a man behind a camera
Who waits patiently for something he won't see
I need to stop giving suggestions and just illuminate the questions
That seems much more accurate to me
To keep the frame as wide as it can be

'Cause all the love and friends and happiness that ever came my way
Revealed themselves the moment I stopped watching
'Cause it's not faith that comes from miracles, but miracles that come from faith
And I'm sure that they've got something in common
I know that they've got something in common
