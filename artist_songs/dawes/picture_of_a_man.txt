In the depths of dizziness 
I picked a fight with myself like a real roughneck
Screaming, "You don't know who you're dealing with." 
I threw a hell of a punch but I couldn't connect

At the edge of a silhouette 
I caught a glimpse of a face I will never forget
Speaking future words of an idiot 
I understood them at once but didn't know what I meant

Be still or break everything in half
Find free will in a drawing of a bath
Kill what you want or save everything you can
Be still. You're the picture of a man

Oh, man, can you picture it? Picture of a man
Oh, man, can you picture it?

In the heat of an argument 
I got tricked into saying that I knew how I felt
As if you give something a value just by naming it 
I'd be a hell of a vendor if I knew who I'd sell

And at the end of everything relevant 
I slowly emptied my lungs and watched the light sunset
Burning everything natural and negative 
I inhaled it all and didn't know where I went

Be still or break everything in half
Find free will in a drawing of a bath
Kill what you want, or save everything you can
Be still. You're the picture of a man
You're the picture of a man
You're the picture of a man

Oh, man, can you picture it? Picture of a man
Oh, man, can you picture it? Picture of a man
