You still wear your hair to your shoulder
You still look like a Friday night
You're still caught somewhere
Between the plans and the dreams
So that neither end up turning out right

And I myself look a few moments older
When I learned that love is not as simple as I thought
It starts to feel more real and the wounds all start to heal
Whether I want them to or not

So tell me why you think I should forgive what you did
And I'll tell you if I understand
'Cause you broke the quick-giving heart of a kid
But you're now coming back to a man

It means a lot that you came here to speak to me
And I will listen in ways I never did before
I'll hear the pause between each word
And when your presentations heard
Then I'll need to show you to the door

'Cause some people were just meant to be a memory
To be called upon to remind us how we've changed
The way the scattered ever-busy bright lights of a city
Might look off to a distant mountain range

And the guy you know is someone I work hard at keeping hid
And he is very good at sticking to the plan
'Cause you broke the quick-giving heart of a kid
But you're now coming back to a man

I might think of you more often then I'm willing to admit
But I can't show every card I'm holding in my hand
'Cause you broke the quick-giving heart of a kid
But you're now coming back to a man
