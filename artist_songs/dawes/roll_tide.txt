I'm sad about the messages you're sending
I'm sad about the shit we're doing wrong
I'm sad about the never-ending love we had
We keep pissing on the fire, but it keeps burning so strong
Can we both just say "I love you" and get it on?

Your boy from Birmingham seems nice enough to me
But unqualified for you, and your heavy vibes
He doesn't know the troubled story that he's written himself into
He doesn't know he's just a place for you to hide
You wanna tell him "Best of luck, man Roll Tide"

Roll Tide
It can't be easier to swim, when the water's high
Roll Tide
When what we want the most has us terrified
Roll Tide
If we don't want to let go, then we have to fight
Roll Tide
Roll Tide

I'm asking now for reconciliation
I'm asking now for what we have to say
I'm asking now for both of us to do a little changing
I wanna dance with you forever, in this one cabaret
If we just allow ourselves, it'll be okay

I close my eyes sometimes, now, when I'm driving
To feel the lack of distance between our sides
To see the orange and purple glow of our two flames
To take my weary self out for a ride
To tell myself, "Hang in, man Roll Tide"

Roll Tide
It can't be easier to swim, when the water's high
Roll Tide
When what we want the most has us terrified
Roll Tide
If we don't want to let go, we have to fight
And if we can't let go, then we have to try
Roll Tide
Roll Tide
