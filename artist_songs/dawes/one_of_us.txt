Your mother finally took all of her money
And put it where her mouth used to be
Turning anybody's ear
About her friends that disappeared
And how she's sailing further out to sea

Your father's spending all of his vacation
Learning foreign names for all his fears
And the spirits he's detected
About the data he's collected [?]
Turned out to be just ringing in his ears
You look like one of them
But you talk like one of us
Everything they're telling you is wrong
You look like one of them
But you talk like one of us
Babe I think you know where you belong

Your sister's always mortally offended
At the mispronunciation of her name
Telling all her newest clients
That the "w" is silent
Before she turns them back the way they came

Your brother sends me all his latest poems
About his secret dreams of learning how to dance
He knows these hands are not for you [?]
Asking when you're coming through
So he can tell his supervisor six months in advance

You look like one of them
But you talk like one of us
Everything they're telling you is wrong
You look like one of them
But you talk like one of us
Babe I think you know where you belong

Your old flame is still counting up his money
In a secret lair he built behind the shelf
When a chance at repetition
Leading out into temptation
I'm pretty sure he knows the way himself

You look like one of them
But you talk like one of us
Everything they're telling you is wrong
You look like one of them
But you talk like one of us
Babe I think you know where you belong
