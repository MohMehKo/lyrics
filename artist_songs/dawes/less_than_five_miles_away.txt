Between the cold drinks in the freezer
And the latest tabloid rags
A voice screams over the music
"Put the money in the bag!"

No one ever hears his reason
No one ever hears his name
This is all happening right now
Less than five miles away

A shifty fortune teller
Communion with the dead
Lying about the astral plane
So she can keep her children fed

Listening to a mother sick with cancer
Wondering what she's gonna say
This is all happening right now
Less than five miles away
This is all happening right now
Less than five miles away

There's a stranger in the bushes
Looking through the windows of a home
At a woman from the movies
That's been living there alone

She's home at 7 in the evening
He sees the code punched in the gate
This is all happening right now
Less than five miles away
This is all happening right now

And it all looks so pretty from a distance
How we're living out this story that we tell
Baby we were both designed out in the cosmos
As just a way of asking questions about itself

You know the great writer that left us
Well his house is still around
Like an old dead volcano
That sleeps over the town

They're gonna turn it into condos
They'll be done by New Year's Day
This is all happening right now
Less than five miles away
This is all happening right now
