You can put them on the counter, there with all the other flowers
And help me figure out how to turn off this TV
I'm glad you made the visit, and if you think you have a minute
You should sit and talk until it's time to leave

Is my granddaughter Ruthie still working at the movies?
Does she still let all her boyfriends in for free?
Does she still stare out of the front door as she's serving people popcorn
And talk about how nice today was supposed to be?

Oh, that's the love that I came to bear witness to
Oh, and the love I'm taking with me when I go

Did you notice walking over at the house down on the corner
There's a dog behind a window that doesn't move
I've seen him staring in the mornings, I've seen him staring in the evenings
As if time stops until his master's in the room

Oh, that's the love that I came to bear witness to
Oh, and the love I'm taking with me when I go

Some nights get worse than others, and I start thinking about your mother
And she's here with me as far as I can tell
As if the world revealed its secret and it's asking me to keep it
Like a kid that hears the ocean in a shell

And that's the love that I came to bear witness to
And the love I'm taking with me when I go

Oh, that's the love that I came to bear witness to
Oh, and the love I'm taking with me when I go
