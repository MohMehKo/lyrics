To be completely honest
The picture isn’t clear to me yet
You insisted that you owed explanations
While I was patiently enjoying the debt

And when I think about it
I’m not even sure if I mind
You were the fading signal that would slip through the static
For a station that I never could find

So you don’t need to say a word right now
All your reasons would just flicker in the darkness
Maybe that’s why nobody knows how
To be completely honest

To be completely honest
It feels like you’re still in the room
From the bracelets that you left on the nightstand
To the crows in the yard each afternoon

And I just can’t get off it
I haven’t been sleeping at all
Some questions weave themselves into the fabric
And some are what compel me to call

But then I never know where I should start
And a record of the symptoms is all I have accomplished
I never really thought it’d be so hard
To be completely honest

To be completely honest
I think I know how it ends
The universe continues expanding
While we discuss particulars of just being friends

And maybe that makes everything okay
Remembering the defect at the heart of every promise
Well maybe that’s the only way

To be completely honest
