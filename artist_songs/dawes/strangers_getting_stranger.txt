Did you hear the one about a joke without a punch-line
Or the song about a movie of a book
Like a stolen bouquet meant to be given away
To the girl that never gives you a look

Well that's how I've been spending all my meantime
Wondering if it's doing any harm
Resetting myself to when everything felt
Like a book I'm holding under my arm

But it's not that I want back all my innocence
Just the joy of losing it again

The favorites get their favors
And this stranger's getting stranger everyday
The great one's all get greater
And this stranger's getting stranger everyday

We got doctors that know everything about us
We can level cities by the end of the day
The world is turning back into dust or maybe it's just
We're becoming all the god's that we've praised

Or maybe the world is finally moving on without us
While we wait to see who's winning some debate
It's like we're running a race after spinning in place
We're pulling left when we've been moving straight

But me I think I'll keep on spinning
And smile as I hit the ground

The favorites get their favors
And this stranger's getting stranger everyday
The great one's all get greater
And this stranger's getting stranger everyday

Like a tree that doesn't look for it's root, it grows
Like a bird on the day that it's season is through, it knows

The favorites get their favors
And this stranger's getting stranger everyday
The great one's all get greater
And this stranger's getting stranger everyday
