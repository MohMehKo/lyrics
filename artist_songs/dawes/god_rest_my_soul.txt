Take a last look around
Take the fall that is due
Hey, take your time, and I'll take mine
It's the last thing that is left for us to do

You have tried to define moments
And all the things that it is not
Your time became some old man's cane
While he dances to a song that he forgot

Oh you can't throw something out there without watching it fall
Only thing that's scarier than dying is not dying at all
So when I have lost all my control
God will rest my soul

I guess your mind can leave your heart
I guess thats what you're doing now
But it doesn't make us friends, or better men
It is not something that love would allow

Oh you can't throw something out there without watching it fall
Only thing that's scarier than dying is not dying at all
So when I have lost all my control
God will rest my soul

And just like how I'll drink myself through my seventh relapse
Like a captain of his sinking ship clutches to his maps
What the figure on the cross thinks with his one final gasp
This too shall pass

Oh you can't throw something out there without watching it fall
Only thing that's scarier than dying is not dying at all
So when I have lost all my control
God will rest my soul
