When the wind is with me
But somehow out of sight
Not knowing where it comes from
Or where it goes

That's the way your memory
Shapes the middle of my night
Since the last time I saw you
And the words you chose when I said
"This must be what love is
Like I saw it in a dream"

You looked into my eyes and said
"You don't know what you mean
'Cause love is for the fisherman
Who cast his nets too far upstream
Fishing for the moon in the water"

So I act now as if I've forgot
My efforts all in vain
I spent some time with a new girl
Who made the simple world seem fine

But like a rose placed in a flower pot
A true nature contained
Not knowing what she asks for
Or what she'll find

When she says, "If I've had love
In my life then surely this is it"
I said, "Anyone who talks like
That doesn't understand one bit
That love is for the fighter born to lose
But never quit, swinging for the moon in the water"

So I left her with her dreams
Where I thought that she belonged
Not with my secrets
Which she heard but never knew

I hoped my loneliness found peace
I hoped my number had been drawn
When all I wanted from her was to
Remind me of you

So I stay out in the streets
Hoping to find you anywhere
Now that I understand
The woman you need to be

I can feel you in the heat
I can taste you in the air
And I can't help but find your face in
Everything I see

And once I can admit you're gone
I'll place it on a star
And wait for the day I'm what you need
And then reach out for heart

'Cause even if love is more my mistress
Than my lovers ever are
You'll always be the moon in the water
