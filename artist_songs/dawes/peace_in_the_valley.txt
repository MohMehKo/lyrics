I think these walls have a message or have changed
Which it is I can't decide.
So I leave with the writer that remains
And let him tell me what his better days were like.

And I sit with the memory of kings
With only words to criticize
As if I finally found the antidote for pain
Without knowing what that's really like.

And our actor ends his love song
And all these lovers sit and stare.
If I don't find peace in the valley
It's cause there wasn't any there.

I will move somewhere the ocean's never seen.
Somewhere weeds just make their claim
Where my best friends exist only on screen
Where my love all fits in frame

But I want fire tumbling out into the night
I want you to know why you hold me close
Pull the quarter from my ear, or say you tried
I need magic or the holy ghost.

And as I drive on through these canyons
I'm still feeling like a crook
If I don't find peace in the valley
I've got no place else to look.
