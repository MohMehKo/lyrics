You never change your mind once it's made up
Unless it's to crawl back on your knees

Is that the way you want it?
You get back to the wall
And put your hands up
It's a holdup
You give up like every time before
That is how you survived the war

You never multiply, all these divisions
You give yourself the least of parts
I put on my green felt hat, pack our privisions
Playing a merry Prince of Thieves

Is that the way you want it?
You get back to the wall
And put your hands up
It's a holdup
You give up like every time before
That is how you survived the war

You're not gonna lose this one
You don't have to cut and run
I think you can choose to love and what is more
That is how you survived the war

Now in a summer's day, spring a ripened plum
How will you live under the sun?
You follow the open road, remembering the guns
When you get lost under the trees

Is that the way you want it?
You get back to the wall
And put your hands up
It's a holdup
You give up like every time before
That is how you survived the war
That is how you survived the war

You never change your mind once it's made up
