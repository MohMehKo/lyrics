Friends I had from younger days
mostly have been washed away
Time's a river so they say, and then you drown,
and then you drown
Heavy storm about to cry like a river from the sky

Life is like a waterfall and you are falling like a doll
You never think of me at all, there isn't time, 
there isn't time
Heavy storm about to cry like a river from the sky

Never you mind, sweet waste of time
Truth is unkind, truth is unkind
You were never mine sweet waste of time
Truth is unkind, truth is unkind

Is there a river in the sky?
An ocean just behind your eyes?
Every night I say goodbye to you again, to you again
Heavy storm about to cry like a river from the sky
