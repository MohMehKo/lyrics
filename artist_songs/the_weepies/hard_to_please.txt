Maybe if you came about
Maybe if you turned this ship around
If you waited this one out
and just put your head down

Oh, in your dreams you find out
Though it's not quite how you remember
In your dreams you find out 
Everything's greener
You're still hard to please

Maybe if you lightened up
Maybe if you wrote that anthem
Raising high a Dixie Cup
Don't put your hand down

What is it worth to you to be a free someone?
What is it worth to you? What would you do?
Everything.

Maybe if you came about
Baby don't you run this ship aground
Feet of water in the well
but you can't keep her head down
No, you can't keep her head down
