Here lie remains of a ship that sailed to close to the storm
Capsized, grounded, washed-up, sounded

[Chorus:]
I hear their voices, sirens singing in the street
I thought they might be calling out for you, for me
I hear their voices, sirens calling out emergency
for you, for me, for you, for you, for you 
for you, for you, for you, for me

Here lies the body of a captain
Foundered in the waves collected by the sirens
Oh, wise women of the sun
Oh, what have you done
Save this frail one left by Poseidon

[Chorus:]
I hear their voices, sirens singing in the street
I thought they might be calling out for you, for me
I hear their voices, sirens calling out emergency
For you, for me, for you, for you, for you 
For you, for you, for you, for me
For you, for you, for you, for you 
For you, for you, for me

I realize the lights of all retreating cars shine red
I realize you will not take back any of those words you've said
What did you say?
What did you say?
Why didn't you stay?

Here lie all the photographs
All that I remember taken under, sent asunder
How I drift through history, a small Sargasso sea
Rising, sinking, still I'm thinking

[Chorus:]
I hear their voices, sirens singing in the street
I thought they might be calling out for you, for me
I hear their voices, sirens calling out emergency
For you, for me, for you, for you, for you 
For you, for you, for you, for me
For you, for you, for you, for you 
For you, for you, for me
