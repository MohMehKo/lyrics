I don't need no trouble
But sometimes trouble needs me
I don't need no trouble
But it's plain to see
Sometimes trouble needs me

A couple of my friends, and a couple omnivores
Adjust me in my rain and I say oh yes of course 
Love is not a law, anybody can enforce
Anybody can enforce

[Chorus:]
I don't need no trouble
But sometimes trouble needs me
I don't need no trouble
But it's plain to see
I don't need no trouble
But sometimes trouble needs me
I don't need no trouble
But it's plain to see
Sometimes trouble needs me

You're the only trouble I need
You're the only trouble I need
You're the only trouble I need
You're the only trouble I need

Knocking on my door, it was trouble that I need
I figured he would fall
But he took me anyway
Always gonna pay for the kindness that you lose
For the kindness that you lose

[Chorus:]
I don't need no trouble
But sometimes trouble needs me
I don't need no trouble
But it's plain to see
I don't need no trouble
But sometimes trouble needs me
I don't need no trouble
But it's plain to see
Sometimes trouble needs me

You're the only trouble I need
You're the only trouble I need
You're the only trouble I need
You're the only trouble I need

There's trouble in the world, and trouble in my life
Trouble is and never seems to be enough time
The more you look for love, the more you gonna find
The more you gonna find

[Chorus:]
I don't need no trouble
But sometimes trouble needs me
I don't need no trouble
But it's plain to see
I don't need no trouble
But sometimes trouble needs me
I don't need no trouble
But it's plain to see
Sometimes trouble needs me
