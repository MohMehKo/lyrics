If you were every wild boy and I was every pretty girl 
We'd pass in the park, a temporary carnival.
In our town, we light fire for rain.
In our town, we light the fires again. 

Cause every ship at sea deserves a harbor, don't I know it.
No little tree alone can make an arbor, don't I know it.
You're the kind of drink that makes each lonely girl 
feel brave and smarter, wild boy.
Don't I know it, wild boy.

I heard you on the airplane, loud as any child.
Your laughter was familiar, your hair was wild.
In our town we light fire for rain.
In our town we light the fires again. 

Cause every ship at sea deserves a harbor, don't I know it.
No little tree alone can make an arbor, don't I know it.
You're the kind of drink that makes each lonely girl feel brave and smarter, 
burn on the way down but you're a firey battery jump-starter.
hang your cans up, 'cause all the boats are heavy in the water, wild Boy.
Don't I know it, Wild boy.

If you were every wild boy, the kind of summer sun.
I'd pass you in the park, tag you and run.
In our town we light fire for rain.
In our town we light the fires again. 

Cause every ship at sea deserves a harbor don't I know it.
No little tree alone can make an arbor don't I know it.
You're the kind of drink that makes each lonely girl 
feel brave and smarter, wild boy, wild boy.
Don't I know it, wild boy.
Don't I know it, wild boy.
