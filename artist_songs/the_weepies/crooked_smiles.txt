You can't get up
Cause you've been down and you are reeling
You catch you breath
by counting cracks upon the ceiling
It makes it somewhat less appealing
to be feeling like you're stealing
someone else's broken heart
Do do do do

This empty end
was never something of your choosing
You could have won
but you were much too busy losing
You go out crusing for a bruising,
An illusion that you use
to cover up your broken heart
Do do do do
Do do do do

Hey crooked smile
It would never work between you and I
And I know it's true
I still love you
You know I do
Do do do do
Do do do do

You don't try no more
but it is not because you're lazy
Without a doubt
you figure out that you are crazy
And it gets hazier
the way we were
I'll stay with her
That left you with another broken heart
Do do do do
Do do do do
do do do do do do
Do do do do
