Dance with me darling, the night is falling
You never answer although all my life I'm calling

Be my honeypie, never say goodbye
If you don't love me I will die
Be my honeypie

You turn me on, keep me up 'til dawn
Come and get me, baby
because soon I will be gone

What good are the stars above
if you're not in love?

Let me make it right, stay with me tonight
You ought to let somebody hold you tight
