Well I know that life is hard,
you make it all right
And I know how dark you get
late in the night

I'm gonna add my effort to you
I'm gonna add my effort to you
Try and love you

You feel wronged by everything
that hasn't been right
Why can't we sit and watch TV 
'til late in the night?

Oh don't take it away, oh don't take it away

When it's dark you say it is
because there's no light
And though it's not I'll say it is
I'll say it's all right
