Standing on the corner watching all the girls go by
I think they were girls
Standing on the corner
Kinda makes you wonder why boys would be girls

Boys who want to be girls live for another world
Boys who want to be girls live so hard,
live hard dreams
And who can say what brings another joy?
I used to want to be a boy

Standing on the corner watching all the girls go by
I give 'em a smile
Standing of the corner, a vision in a sequin tie
Dreams take a while

Senorita glad to meet ya, 
did your daddy treat you mean?
I know what you mean
Oh Chiquita kinda makes me weep to see ya
Live in a dream in high heeled shoes and pinks
and blues
So blue

Standing on the corner watching all the girls go by
I think they were girls
