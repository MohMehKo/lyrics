Be my thrill 
My little white pill 
My unpaid bill 
The one who will 
Be my love 
My little grey dove 
My push and my shove 
My heaven above 
And we tumble down like Jack and Jill 
And I miss all of the joy you kill 
But I love you still 
Be my thrill 
Be my one 
My day in the sun 
My little pop gun 
The best thing I've done 
Be my what 
My open and shut 
My everything but 
My little hot slut 
And we tumble down like Jack and Jill 
And I miss all of the joy you kill 
But I love you still 
Be my thrill 
Every morning is like the one before 
And Everybody needs someone to adore 
I'm counting on you 
Oh oh baby say you will 
Oh oh baby be my thrill 
Be my youth 
My kissing booth 
My little sweet tooth 
My beauty and truth 
Be my thrill 
My little white pill 
My wait up until 
The one who will 
And we tumble down like Jack and Jill 
And I miss all of the joy you kill 
But I love you still 
Be my thrill 
And we tumble down like Jack and Jill 
And I miss all of the joy you kill 
But I love you still 
Be my thrill 
Yeah I love you still 
Be my thrill
