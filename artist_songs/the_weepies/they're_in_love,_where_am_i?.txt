Lovers walk two by two,
doing things lovers do
They're in love, where am I?
I see them on my way home,
how I hate to be alone
They're in love, where am I?

I guess I have to hope
that today the sun will shine
And maybe tomorrow you'll be mine

Until that day I will wait
and watch the lovers on the lake
They're in love, where am I?
I walk alone on lover's land,
past the kisses in the rain
They're in love, where am I?
They're in love, where am I?
