You will meet him on a train
You will meet him on a plane
You will meet him on the way 
to somewhere you have never been

You've got to get on board
You've got to spread your wings
You've got to take a chance 
if you want romance and fancy things

If you want magic, well
You've got to cast a spell
You've got to stay up late
You've got to make him wait
Magicians never tell

You've got to get on board
You've got to spread your wings
You've got to take a chance 
if you want romance and fancy things

I'm just poor merchant looking for a way to the sea
Wandering the desert
Looking for somebody who is looking for me

And when you've traveled far enough
You will find yourself in love
And when you lie down in the night
You will sleep under the light
from the stars above

First you've got to get on board
You've got to spread your wings
You've got to take a chance 
if you want romance and fancy things
You've got to take a chance 
if you want romance and fancy things
You've got to take a chance
if you want romance and fancy things
