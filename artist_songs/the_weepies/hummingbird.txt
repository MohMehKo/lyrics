Always been like a hummingbird
And I can't keep still
Listen up, lover listen up, I never will

Wings move faster than the human eye
And if you could see my heart
Well, if you could see my heart,
Kept from flying outwards
Somehow I don't know
Wonder I don't come apart
Wonder I don't come apart

Hold out your hand
Yours is the only one that I dare land upon

Stole a ruby necklace
From the chamber of a queen
Distraction for my heart
Distraction for my heart
Thrumming like a diver's every time you're near
The only sound I hear, it's the only sound I hear

Sweetness captures honeybees in time
Amber like your eyes, amber like your eyes
Maybe there's a season when I'll taste that wine
A thimble at a time, a thimbleful of wine
