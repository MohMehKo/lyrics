You were a gypsy, I was one too
I only was one so I could meet someone like you
And in the morning how blue the sky
I don’t know why I ever said goodbye

You were a fortune-teller, you read my hand
You said I’d leave you and go off to other lands
You said with a smile that one day I’d make you cry
I don’t know why I ever said goodbye

Don’t know why the seasons change
Don’t know why I am so strange
Don’t know why I lose my heart again each time I hear your name
Don’t know why I didn’t stay, don’t know why I didn’t say
That I didn’t know what love was but I loved you anyway

Over the mountains, across the sea
Is there someone who sometimes thinks of me?
How deep the ocean, how blue the sky
I don’t know why I ever said goodbye
