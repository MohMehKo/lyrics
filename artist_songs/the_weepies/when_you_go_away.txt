When you go away it's like you hide the sun
I regret today, the things that we might have done

No relief from grey skies
Where'd you take those blue eyes?
What can I do?

When you go away it's an unfinished song
Can't find words to say
but I know where you belong

Take me with you this time, won't you, won't you?
Don't make me miss you this time
don't you, don't you
We're so much better together don't you think?
I do.

Walk the street parade looking through everyone 
But they don't have your face
Oh look what I've become
