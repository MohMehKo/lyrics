No money, no friends
You just passed the end
How do you get high?
You don't drink, don't smoke
You'll live long, you hope
How do you get high?

I'm down with no plans
One thing I don't understand
How do you get high?

Long pipe, big bowl
You feel good, you feel old
How do you get high?
You leave early, you stay late
You smile while your heart breaks
How do you get high?

Long past no hope
You're fixed, you're broke
How do you get high?
No money, no friends
You just passed the end
How do you get high?
