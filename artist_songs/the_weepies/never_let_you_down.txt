Yeah, you're so everything
I would do anything
We want the same thing
I'd never let you down

Oh come on, buttercup
And let me interrupt
I wanna pick you up
And never let you down

[Chorus:]
I'll never let you down
Never let you go
Sweet baby
Sweet babe, I'll never get to say
So come and kiss me sweet
This is a lonely time
I'll never let you down

You wait and wait and
I know you hate it
I get you elevated
Never let you down

You think I let you go
Oh, you don't even know
I bent so low that I could
Never let you down

[Chorus]

A bright star
You got your feet on the ground

A bright star
So no one lets you down

Oh yeah, you've been around

Cherry cola
You rock and roll-ah
It's like I told ya
I'll never let you down

Oh come on, buttercup
And let me interrupt
I wanna pick you up
And never let you down

[Chorus x2]
