Take the sky for example, a canvas of a billion suns
But our local hero shines them out by day
Save for the winking of a Venus or Mars

Even the stars sometimes fade to gray
Even the stars hide away

I see the bare moon raise his big, bald head
I see my friends played the fool
I'll make my own way in the wide world
Just now I don't want to wander too far

Even the stars sometimes fade to gray
Even the stars hide away
Even the stars sometimes fade to gray
Even the stars hide away

Some will call me all kinds of names
Some will say I don't play the right kind of game
I try to be honest, try to be kind
And honestly leave when I know that it's time
I know that it's time

Hear a phoebe sing his only song
This summer's day is hovering
I'll ride my full heart, troubles fly like embers
Out the windows of our traveling car

Even the stars sometimes fade to gray
Even the stars hide away
Even the stars sometimes fade to gray
Even the stars hide away
Even the stars sometimes fade to gray
Even the stars hide away
