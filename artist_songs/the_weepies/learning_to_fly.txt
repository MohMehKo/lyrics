Well I started out down a dirty road, started out all alone
And the sun went down as I crossed the hill
And the town lit up and the world got still

I’m learning to fly but I ain’t got wings
Coming down is the hardest thing

Now the good old days may not return, and the rocks may melt and the sea may burn
I’m learning to fly but I ain’t got wings, coming down is the hardest thing

Some say life will beat you down, break your heart, steal your crown
So I started out for god knows where I guess I’ll know when I get there

I’m learning to fly around the clouds
What goes up must come down.
I’m learning to fly but I ain’t got wings
Coming down is the hardest thing
