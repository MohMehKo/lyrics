In a vine-covered shack in the mountains
Bravely fighting the battle of time
Is a dear one who's weathered life's sorrows
It's that silver haired daddy of mine

If I could recall all the heartaches
Dear old daddy, I've caused you to bear
If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair

If God would but grant me the power
Just to turn back the pages of time
I'd give all I own if I could but atone
To that silver haired daddy of mine

But I know it's too late, dear old daddy
To repay for the sorrows and cares
Though dear mother is waiting in Heaven
Just to comfort and solace you there

If I could recall all the heartaches
Dear old daddy, I've caused you to bear
If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair

If God would but grant me the power
Just to turn back the pages of time
I'd give all I own if I could but atone
To that silver haired daddy of mine
