Last night I heard a record playin'
On the radio, as I walked through the door
And the song revived some sweet old memories
'Cause I knew I've heard the tune somewhere before

I stopped a moment and I listened
And then I finally realized
That you were here the night you wrote it
A song called The Beginning Of Goodbye

I knew, that night, that it was over
And that I couldn't keep you. Should I try?
'Cause you were really talkin' to me
When you wrote The Beginning Of Goodbye

You left, and patiently I waited
'Cause I believed you'd write to me
But you don't have time there for an old friend
With your new friends in Nashville, Tennessee

I knew, that night, that it was over
And that I couldn't keep you. Should I try?
'Cause you were really talkin' to me
When you wrote The Beginning Of Goodbye
