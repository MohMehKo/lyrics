(Content we'll be if we will choose his way)

What God has done is not a hidden secret
Our eyes behold his glory day by day
Our hearts may feel his presence close beside us
Content we'll be if we will choose his way

Great are the words of God the great creator
Great is the work done by his mighty hand
In heaven or earth there's no one who is greater
And in his love forever we shall stand

His is a tune to hear the pain just disperse
His heart is overflowing now with love
His eyes are heavens searching longing for us
And with his hands he beckons from above

Great are the words of God the great creator...
