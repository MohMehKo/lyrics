If I could stay away
Then I could break away
I've lost control somehow
I'm too far gone

I'm at my all time low
Don't know which way to go
Can't get you off my mind
I'm too far gone

I've tried to tell myself that I don't want you
But it's nothin' more than just a feeble try
When you kiss me like no other one has kissed me
Oh, the thrill I get tells me I've told a lie

Oh, Leslie lovin' you
It's wrong but still I do
I can't get over you
I'm too far gone

I'd like to rearrange
My life but I can't change
Too late I find out now
I'm too far gone

I've tried to tell myself that I don't love you
But it's nothin' more than just a feeble try
When you kiss me like no one but you can  kissed me
Oh, the thrill I get tells me I've told a lie
