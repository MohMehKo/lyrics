The leaves of brown came tumbling down
Remember that September in the rain
The sun went out just like a dying ember
That September in the rain
To every word of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to sing a sweet refrain
Though spring is here to me it's still September
That September in the rain

The leaves of brown came tumbling down
Remember that September in the rain
The sun went out just like a dying ember
That September in the rain
To every word of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to sing a sweet refrain
Though spring is here to me it's still September
That September in the rain
