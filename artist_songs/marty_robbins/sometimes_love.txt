Sometimes love is like a clear day
And you can almost see forever
When the skies are overcast
With threatining clouds of never

Like a blanket they descend
Bringing chilly winds of sorrow
As the land of love grows dim
You can't even see tomorrow

Come the storms of disappointment
Come the rains of deep dispair
Howling winds of desperation
There's no shelter anywhere

Then the storm begins to weaken
Slow at first, but finally dies
Suddenly you see tomorrow
As you do you realize

Sometimes love is like a clear day
And you can almost see forever
