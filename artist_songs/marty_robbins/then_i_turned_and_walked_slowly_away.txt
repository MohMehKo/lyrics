I saw you last night, again, darlin'
And you seemed just as lovely to me
I watched as you danced with a stranger
And you seemed just as happy as he

I watched as you danced with a stranger
And since you seemed happy and gay
I watched thru a mist in my eyes, love
Then I turned and walked slowly away.

I saw you last night, again, darlin'
And I cried, dear, all night until dawn
A new love has come to your heart, dear
And an old love has faded and gone.

I hope, dear, that you will be happy
There's nothin' more left now to say
I saw you last night, again, darlin'
Then I turned and walked slowly away.
