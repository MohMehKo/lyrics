Yesterday you said you loved me
But today you say it's over now
Why did you go away and leave me
All the world is lonely now

Don't tell me that you'd love another
And that you've broken every vow
Cause I don't want to live without you
All the world is lonely now

I've tried so hard to make you happy
With love you're heart would not allow
It hurts to know you'll never love me
All the world is lonely now

Goodbye, good luck and may God bless you
I'll try to get along some how
I know I'll never love another
All the world is lonely now
