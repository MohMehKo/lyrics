This is our last goodbye
The curtain is descending
This is our last goodbye
The show has had it's run
Now it's ending
I was not the star but
Mine was an important part
I gave all that I could give
There was nothin' left to give
After I gave my heart

This is our last goodbye
I'll leave the stage in laughter
I just can't let her see
The fool she's made of me
The tears come after
I've rehearsed so much that I
Can't leave the stage and never cry
This is our last goodbye
