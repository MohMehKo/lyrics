This is the end of a romance
It was almost but not quite, you see
I couldn't give you a thing you don't already have
Little rich girl, you're too good for me

My love for you was no secret
It was one love that just couldn't be
I could never compete with the nice things you have
Little rich girl, you're too good for me

May the warm winds of love keep your world all aglow
May you never be lonesome like me
May the cold, chilly winds of despair never blow
Little rich girl, you're too good for me

May the warm winds of love keep your world all aglow
May you never be lonesome like me
May the cold, chilly winds of despair never blow
Little rich girl, you're too good for me
