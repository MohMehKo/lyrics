Don't look now but your heart of blue is showin'
And I know now that soon you will be knowin'
What it means to step aside and swallow up your pride
Your destiny is plain to see but don't look now

Don't blame your heartaches on somebody else
The harm is done you've had your fun
And now you're on the shelf
You win the right to cry when you cheat and tell me lies
Your heart of blue is showin' through but don't look now

Don't look now but I see your tears are fallin'
And the blues at your door will soon be callin'
There's nothin' you can do it's all come back to you
I see disgrace upon your face but don't look now

Don't blame your heartaches on somebody else
The harm is done you've had your fun
And now you're on the shelf
You win the right to cry when you cheat and alibi
Your heart of blue is showin' through but don't look now
