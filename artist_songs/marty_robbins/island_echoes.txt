The same old island echoes
Are stealing through the trees
They bring back moments tender
To fill my memory
Now I'm alone in moonlight
That you and I had shared
Pretending we're together
Remembering how you cared

The laughter and the good times
The many things we planned
The romance in the moonlight
Castles in the sand
I love those island echoes
Echoes they must be
Till some glad tomorrow
When you come back to me

The laughter and the good times
The many things we planned
Romance in the moonlight
Castles in the sand
I love the island echoes
Echoes they must be
Until some glad tomorrow
When you come back to me
