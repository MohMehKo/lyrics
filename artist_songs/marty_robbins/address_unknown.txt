I waited each day for your letter
Although I knew what it would cause
The moment it came I knew that your game
Had been won and I knew that I had lost

I just didn't open your letter
I know you're no longer my own
The moment it came I wrote 'neath my name
These heartbreakin' words, address unknown

I wanted to open your letter
To see if you missed me sometimes
But you have a way of makin' me pay
'Cause I know what you write between the lines

You know I'd be so glad to see you
In spite of the hurt you have done
But deep down inside I can't lose my pride
And forgive you just cause you're the one

So I just didn't open your letter
I know you're no longer my own
The moment it came I wrote 'neath my name
These heartbreakin' words, address unknown
