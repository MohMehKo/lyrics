Up in the air when you're with me
Down in the dumps when you're gone
You're out of sight, my day becomes night
Everything seems to go wrong

I'm like a child when you're with me
Emotions I cannot contain
You walk beside me, happiness drives me
Everything seems right as rain

I'm like a lamp in the corner
Goes out whenever you're gone
You disappear, then when you reappear
The lamp in the corner comes on

Mold me and make me to please you
That's how I want it to be
I won't complain if you make me a clown
Long as you care for me

I'm like a lamp in the corner
Goes out whenever you're gone
You disappear, then when you reappear
The lamp in the corner comes on

Mold me and make me to please you
That's how I want it to be
I won't complain if you make me a clown
Long as you care for me
