Day in, day out you're the one I think about
Can't erase your sweet face from my mind
It's true, so true I'm still in love with only you
Wonder if I ever cross your mind

Every day is Blue Monday to live without you
And the bittersweet memories keep me feelin' blue
Should your world start to tumble and your castle should fall
Reach for me I won't be far at all

[Spoken]
Ya know it's been a long time now, honey, since I last saw ya.
And I guess by now you've gone a long way toward forgettin' we ever met.
But it's still the same with me, I guess even if I wanted to I couldn't forget. 
I think a lot about the night ya told me ya loved me. 
I wonder if you were just acting. And if you were then you deserve some kind 
Of an award for being able to act so mean and so cruel. 
And if that's true then don't you think I should be nominated as 1962's most promising fool?
I remember the night we called it quits. I knew that our breakup was away overdue. 
But have you ever found something that ya really wanted, even though you knew you couldn't keep it? 
Ya hated to let go of it. Well that's the way I felt about you.
At the time everything seemed so right but now I know that it was all wrong. 
I know that you'll manage to get by without me. 
As for me, well, I guess I'll get along.

[Sing]
Should your world start to tumble and your castle should fall
Reach for me I won't be far at all
