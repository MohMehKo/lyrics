How long did you think you could go on hurting me
And I'd be your fool and wait at home alone
You go out and have your fun like you were free
Tonight I'll have some pleasures of my own

'Cause the shoe goes on the other foot tonight
We'll find out if two wrongs can make a right
Tonight I'll push my heartaches out of sight
'Cause the shoe goes on the other foot tonight

Each time you walk out the door you walk on me
And leave the door wide open for the blues
You fly away from me like you were free
You must think there's wings upon your shoes

But the shoe goes on the other foot tonight
We'll find out if two wrongs can make a right
Tonight I'll push my heartaches out of sight
'Cause the shoe goes on the other foot tonight
