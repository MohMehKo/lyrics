When you're far away from home
When you're blue and all alone
There's an old friend, a real friend
Who loves and misses you.

When you're down to your last dime
And there's nothin' left but time
There's an old friend, a real friend
Who loves and misses you.

When by new friends you've been taken
And old friends, foresaken
There is one friend you can turn to
Until your skies are blue.

When you're down to your last dime
And there's nothin' left but time
There's an old friend, a real friend
Who loves and misses you.

When by new friends you've been taken
And by old friends, foresaken
There is one friend you can turn to
Until your skies are blue.

When you're down to your last dime
And there's nothin' left but time
There's an old friend, a real friend
Who loves and misses you...
