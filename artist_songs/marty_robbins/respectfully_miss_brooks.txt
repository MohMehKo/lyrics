I got a letter from my baby
Came in the mail yesterday
She had an awful lot on her mind
She had an awful lot to say
Well, she treated me like an old, old friend
Just like a used to be
Well, I know by heart the words she wrote to me

Oh yeah, well, well

She said, "Dear Mister Johnson
Please sent back the letter that
I wrote you long time ago
We were kids, thought we were in love."
Oh yeah, well
She said, "Dear Mister Johnson
Please send back a picture that we took."
And it was signed respectfully, Miss Brooks

Oh yeah, well, well

Well I cried and I cried and I cried some more
I fell right down and I cried on the floor
I was hurtin' way down deep inside
Where it don't show, don't show
Well, I never felt so bad in my whole life
Thought Miss Brooks was gonna be my wife
But I done found out how wrong a man in love can be
Oh yeah

Well, I cried yesterday and all last night
Nothin' ever gonna be alright
Oh, well I called Miss Brooks on the phone
And here's what I said well, I cried, I said now
Please-se-se-se don't-o-o-on't make-a-a-ake me send you
The letters that you wrote me
Wrote me long time ago-o-o
Please-se-se-se don't-o-o-on't make-a-a-ake me
Send you back the pictures that we took
Cause I still love you Miss Brooks

Well I cried and I cried and I cried some more
Fell right down and I cried on the floor
I was hurtin' way down deep inside
Where it don't show, oh, well, well
Well, I never felt so bad in my whole life
I thought Miss Brooks was gonna be my wife
But I done found out how wrong a man in love can be
