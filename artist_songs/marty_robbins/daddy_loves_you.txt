Baby, baby go to sleep
You're in daddy's arms, don't weep
Don't be 'fraid of darkness, dear
Daddy loves you, daddy's near

God's been mighty good to me
Daddy's thankful as can be
For the one he loves so dear
Daddy loves you. daddy's near

What if God decides to take you
Then what would I do
He should know how much you mean
So let him take me too

Close your eyes, and when you do
Angels will watch over you
When they open I'll appear
Daddy loves you, daddy's near

What if God decides to take you
Then what would I do
He should know how much you mean
So let him take me too

Close your eyes, and when you do
Angels will watch over you
When they open I'll appear
Daddy loves you, daddy's near
