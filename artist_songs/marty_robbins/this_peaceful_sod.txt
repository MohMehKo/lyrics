I'm just a poor cowboy singin' his song 
No money to jingle as I ride along
I'm rejected by men but accepted above 
I belong in this valley on this peaceful sod

Let me ride from the mountains to the dark rolling sea
I'm broke but I'm wealthy because I am free
Let me walk in this valley where my fathers had trod
Let me live forever on this peaceful sod

Let me live on this land till I'm withered and old
Till I'm meek and I'm humble and the Lord wants my soul
Let me live in this valley where my fathers had trod
Let me live forever on this peaceful sod
