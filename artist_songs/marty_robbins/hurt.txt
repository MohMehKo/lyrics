I'm hurt to think that you lied to me
Hurt way down deep inside of me
You said you loved me and we'd never part
Now you found someone new and it breaks my heart.

Hurt much more than you'll ever know
Hurt because I still love you so
Even though you've hurt me like no one else can do
I could never know never hurt you.

Even though you've hurt me like no one else can do
I could never know never hurt you...
