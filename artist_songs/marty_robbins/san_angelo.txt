North of the border of Old Mexico
I rode one day to the cowtown of San Angelo
A hot sun was glowing, a warm wind was blowing
Still not as warm as the lips that I waited to kiss

Cheeks that would blush in red roses to shame
Lips that were fresher than flowers when kissed by the rain
Dark eyes that sparkled much brighter than diamonds
She was a beauty, Socorro was my lovers name

I met her down in Lorado
Everyone there in this border town called her the 'Rose'
Mexican cowboys drank to Socorro
Everyone loved her but I was the one that she chose

An outlaw above all the rest
Now my heart beats so madly
Soon she will be at my side

She sent a message a long time ago
Socorro had promised to meet me at San Angelo
I was aware of the chance I was taking
I was an outlaw but great was my love for this girl

I must be with her, I can't stay away
Nights spent without her are lonely and so are the days
If it means death then I'll have to chance it
Only a few moments more and she'll be in my arms

At ten o' clock in the morning
I tied my horse and I started to walk down the street
Where was Socorro, had she forgotten
This was the day and the hour that she wanted to meet

But something is wrong with our plans
And I fear death awaits me
Here on this hot dusty street

Up on a housetop but still I can see
There hides a man with a rifle, it's pointed at me
I might escape from the man with a rifle
But there are others just like him that I cannot see

Back of each window the click of a gun
Die if I stay and my love for her won't let me run
Where is Socorro, will my eyes see her
Then in a moment she runs from a door down the street

"Up on your horse", she is crying
"Ride out of town, it's a trap and they're waiting for you"
But if I ride out, she must ride with me
Then in a moment I know that our chances are gone

For a bullet is well on its way
And it finds my Socorro
She dies as she falls in my arms

Tears dim my vision but plainly I see
The ranger that killed her is standing there waiting for me
I walk to meet him, my one thought is 'Beat him'
He deserves death and I swear that this ranger will die

I beat his draw and I shot him
Shot him six times just as fast as the bullets would fly
My gun is empty or more I would shoot him
Now there are others just like him that want me to die

Their bullets are coming my way
How they hurt when they hit me
The pain makes me fall to the ground

Gone is my strength, just the will left to fight
I hear the sound of the lead as it robs me of life
If I must die, let me find Socorro
Let me hold on to her hand for the few moments left

Blindly I search and it isn't in vain
I touch the soft velvet hand and it eases the pain
Life is no more but we're together
Even in death she's my lover, it's over, goodbye
