My little heart 'ill goes ping, something's gone wrong

I'll know you're gone
(I'll know you're gone)
By the way the little birds don't sing
I'll know you're gone
(I'll know you're gone)
By the way the little bells don't ring
I'll know 'cause the sun won't shine
And the moon won't glow
I'd lie to myself but my heart would know
My little heart 'ill goes ping, something's gone wrong

Well, you can fool lots of things
But this little heart knows
What's gonna happen from the start
When you pack your bags to go away
It knows it's the one who has to pay

I'll know you're gone
(I'll know you're gone)
'Cause the days 'ill all be long
I'll know you're gone
(I'll know you're gone)
'Cause the rivers won't roll on
I'll know 'cause ships won't sail
And the planes won't fly
I'd raise my head but they'd see me cry
My little heart 'ill goes ping, something's gone wrong
