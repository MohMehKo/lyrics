This is the night of love
The shining of our love, Kalua
Her song is in the air
Her lips are waiting there
Who will be Kalua's only love
(who will her lover be)
(who will her lover be)

Before the night is old
My arms will hold Kalua
And as the trade winds blow soft and low
(soft and low)
Our love will blossom bright in the night
(in the night)
And stars will sing above
The love song of Kalua

(who will her lover be)
(who will her lover be)
Before the night is old
My arms will hold Kalua
And as the trade winds blow soft and low
(soft and low)
Our love will blossom bright in the night
(in the night)
And stars will sing above
The love song of Kalua
(who will her lover be)
(who will her lover be)
