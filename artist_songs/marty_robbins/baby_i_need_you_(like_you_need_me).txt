Two lips need two more to kiss them
Two lips need two more to miss 'em
Baby, I need you like you need me
The sun and sky need one another
That's the way we need each other
Baby, I need you like you need me

Let's not try to fool our hearts, dear
Let's make up tonight
It only hurts to be apart, dear
'Cause it isn't right
Your lips need my lips to kiss them
My lips need your lips to miss them
Baby, I need you like you need me

Two hearts make a team of love, dear
When they both beat just as one, dear
Baby, I need you like you need me
Two hands need two more to cling to
A lover needs one more to sing to
Baby, I need you like you need me

Let's not try to fool our hearts, dear
Let's make up tonight
It only hurts to be apart, dear
'Cause it isn't right
People need someone to hold them
Love 'em lots and sometimes scold them
Baby, I need you like you need me
