Well, I am a roving gambler I've gambled all around
Whenever I need my deck of cards I lay my money down
I lay my money down I lay my money down

I had not been in Washington many more days than three
When I fell in love with a pretty little girl
And she fell in love with me
She fell in love with me fell in love with me

She took me in her parlor cooled me with her fan
Whispered low in Mama's ear I love this gambling man
I love this gambling man love this gambling man

Daughter oh dear daughter what makes you treat me so
To leave your dear old Mama and with that gambler go
Mother, oh dear Mother you know I love you well
But the love I have for the gambling man
No human tongue can tell
No human tongue can tell human tongue can tell

Well I hear the train a-commin', commin' around the curve
Whistlin' and a blowin', strainin' every nerve
Mother, oh dear Mother I'll tell you if I can
If you ever see me commin' again, I'll be with a gamblin' man
Be with a gamblin' man, be with a gamblin' man
