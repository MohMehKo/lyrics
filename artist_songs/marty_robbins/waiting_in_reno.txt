She will be waiting in Reno with love warm and tender
She loves and wants me and her love to me she'll surrender
This girl with the black eyes and skin touched by hot winds and sunshine
Will be waiting in Reno tonight and this is the night she'll be mine
Waiting in Reno for my arms to find her and hold her
Waiting and hoping that I will not be far behind her
Black eyes and red ruby lips excitement in her fingertips
Passion is there on her lips she'll be waiting in Reno tonight

It's been so long since I've seen her but I still remember
The tears in the dark eyes when I said that I had to leave her
And the way that her lips stayed on mine like a warm burning ember
She'll be waiting in Reno tonight this is the night she'll be mine
Waiting in Reno...
