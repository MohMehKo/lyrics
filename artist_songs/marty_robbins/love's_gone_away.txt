Love's gone away
She never wanted to stay
Hours go by each one seem like a day
When love's gone away.

My eyes look but they don't see
Blinded by her memory
Bitter tears falling as I keep recalling
How she took her love from me.

Love's gone away
She never wanted to stay
Hours go by each one seem like a day
When love's gone away.

My eyes look but they don't see
Blinded by her memory
Bitter tears falling as I keep recalling
How she took her love from me.

Love's gone away
She never wanted to stay
Hours go by each one seem like a day
When love's gone away.

Love's gone away
She never wanted to stay
Hours go by each one seem like a day
When love's gone away...
