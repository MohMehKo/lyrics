A group of jolly cowboys discussing plans at ease
Said one I'll tell you something, boys, if you will listen, please
I am an old cow puncher and here I'm dressed in rags
I used to be a tough one and go on great big jags

Once I had a home, boys, and a good one you all know
Though I haven't seen it since long long years ago
I'm going back to Dixie once more to see'em all
Yes, I am going home, boys, when the work's all done this fall

Now when I left my home, boys, my Mother for me cried
She begged me not to go, boys, for me she would have died
My Mother's heart is breaking
I've broken it that's all
But with God's help I'll see her when the work's all done this fall

When the roundup days are over and the shipping all is done
I'm going right straight home, boys, before my money's gone
I have changed my way, boys, no more will I fall
Yes, I am going home, boys, when the work's all done this fall

That very night the cowboy went out to stand his guard
The night was dark and cloudy and storming very hard
The cattle they got frightened and rushed in wild stamped
The cowboy tried to turn them while riding at full speed

While riding in the darkness alone, he did shout 
He did his best to head them and turn the herd about
His saddle horse did stumble and on him he did fall
He'll not see his Mother when the work's all done this fall

Boys, send my Mother my wages--the wages I have earned
Cause I am afraid, boys, my last steer I have turned
I'm going to a new range. I hear my Master's call
Yes, I am going home, boys, when the work's all done this fall

Fred, you take my saddle. Jim, you take my bed
Johnny, take my pistol after I am dead
Think about me kindly as you look upon them all
I'll not see my Mother when the work's all done this fall

Charlie was buried at sunrise. No toombstone at his head
Nothing but a thin board, and this is what it said
"poor Charlie died at daybreak. He died from a fall
He'll not see his Mother when the work's all done this fall
