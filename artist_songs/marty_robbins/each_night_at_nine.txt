A thousand miles, dear, a thousand more
Across the water, across the shore
Please say a prayer, dear, for yours and mine
Please think of me, dear, each night at nine

The bugles playin', out go the lights
Gee, but it's lonely these army nights
Just tell the kids, love, I'm doin' fine
Give them my love, dear, each night at nine

I have your picture close to my heart
It takes your place while we're apart
Helps to remind me that you're still mine
Please think of me, dear, each night at nine
