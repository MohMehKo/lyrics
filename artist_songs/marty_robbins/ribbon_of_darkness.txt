Ribbon of darkness over me
Since my true love walked out the door
Tears I never had before
Ribbon of darkness over me 

Clouds are gathering over my head
That kill the day and hide the sun
That shroud the night when day is done
Ribbon of darkness over me 

Rain is falling on the meadow
Where once my love and I did lie
Now she is gone from the meadow
My love goodbye 

Ribbon of darkness over me
Where once the world was young as spring
Where flowers did bloom and birds would sing
Ribbon of Darkness over me 

In this cold room lying
Don't want to see no one but you
Lord, I wish I could be dying
To forget you 

How I wish your old heart could see
How mine just takes and breaks all day
Come on back and take away
Ribbon of Darkness over me 

Come on back and take away
Ribbon of Darkness over me
