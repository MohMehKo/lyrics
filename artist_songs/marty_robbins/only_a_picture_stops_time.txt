I looked at the pictures of you and I
Taken before your love for me died
And I relive the moments when you were mine
'Cause only a picture stops time

I live in the present and look at the past
I have no future, your love didn't last
But I keep your picture so I won't lose my mind
'Cause only a picture stops time

Each heartbeat reminds me that we're far apart
Though I hold your picture so close to my heart

So I'll have a moment with you now and then
Since you once loved me I know you'll understand
Why I keep your picture, I hope you kept mine
'Cause only a picture stops time
