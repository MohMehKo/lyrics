Down where the tradewinds play down where they lose the day
We found a new world where Paradise starts
We traded hearts the night that I sailed away
Flowers were in her hair music was everywhere
Under an awning of silvery boughs
We traded vows the night that I sailed away

Tradewinds what are vows that lovers make
Tradewinds are they only made to break
When it is May again I'll sail away again
Though I'm returning it won't be the same
She traded her name way down where the tradewinds play

Tradewinds what are vows that lovers make
Tradewinds are they only made to break
When it is May again I'll sail away again
Though I'm returning it won't be the same
She traded her name way down where the tradewinds play
