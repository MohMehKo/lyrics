I'm tied to someone that's true and yet I love another too
Oh ain't life a crying shame
I hate to hurt them either one I want 'em both can't have but one
Oh ain't life a crying shame
I wish I knew which way to turn which love light should I let burn
Makes no difference how I choose I can't win I'll only lose
Bound to break somebody's heart tear somebody's world apart
Oh ain't life a crying shame

I wish I knew which way to turn...
