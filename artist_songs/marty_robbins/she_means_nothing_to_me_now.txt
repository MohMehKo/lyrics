Go ahead and call her if you want to
She and I aren't tied by any vow
Just do as you please if it puts your mind at ease
She means nothin' to me now

I confess that she used to be my baby
But we just couldn't get along, somehow
So go on and make your call, it won't bother me at all
'Cause she means nothin' to me now

The only time I ever think about her
Is when I'm alone or with somebody else
I make believe that I can live without her
But I'm not foolin' no one but myself

I know the masquerade won't last forever
But I'll act as long as my heart will allow
I'm just lyin' when I say, for in every scene I play
She means nothin' to me now
