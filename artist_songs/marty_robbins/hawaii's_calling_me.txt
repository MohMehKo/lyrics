Hawaii calls to me come back to the land of love
To the beach of Waikiki and the stars that shine above
To the rolling surfs where the native boys will play
And a hula girl with a flower lace

Where the tradewinds are softly blowing the sails along
And steel guitars playing the Island songs
My paradise that's where I long to be
On my isle of dreams Hawaii calls to me

Where the tradewinds are softly blowing the sails along
And steel guitars playing the Island songs
My paradise that's where I long to be
On my isle of dreams Hawaii calls to me
