Today you tell me we are through
That you no longer can be true
You've no right to be unkind
Darlin', what made you change your mind

It seems like only yesterday
I love you true, I'd hear you say
Now you're leavin' me behind
Darlin', what made you change your mind

Is lovin' you so awful wrong
Without your love I can't go on
I can't believe you're so unkind
Darlin', what made you change your mind

Why are my days and nights so long
It's hard to hope when hope is gone
Could lovin' you be such a crime
Darlin', what made you change your mind
