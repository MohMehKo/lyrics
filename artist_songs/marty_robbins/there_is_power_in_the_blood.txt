Would you be free from your burden of sin
There's power in the blood power in the blood
Would you o'er evil a victory win
There's wonderfull power in the blood

There is power power wonder working power in the blood of the lamb
There is power power wonder working power in the precious blood of lamb

Would you be whiter much wither than snow
There's power in the blood power in the blood
Sin's stains are lost and its life giving flow
There's one flicker power in the blood

There is power power wonder working power in the blood of the lamb
There is power power wonder working power in the precious blood of lamb

Would you do service for Jesus your king
There's power in the blood power in the blood
Would you lift David his praises to sing
There's wonderfull power in the blood

There is power power wonder working power in the blood of the lamb
There is power power wonder working power in the precious blood of lamb
