Well, I don't like this roamin' around
Travelin' alone from town to town
Time brings nothin' but thoughts of you
Makin' me lonely makin' me blue
And it's drivin' me crazy but what can I do

Well I can't stay away and I can't stay home
Nothin' but the blues since you've been gone
I was wrong but I know it's not right
To make me suffer both day and night
And it's drivin' me crazy but what can I do

If I behave like I ought to do
And do the things you want me to
Well, you've come back just one more time
And drive the blues out of my mind

Well I remember the way that you smile
The way you kiss and your special style
I remember your love for me
The love that I treated so carelessly
And it's drivin' me crazy but what can I do

Well if I behave like I ought to do
And do the things you want me to
Well, you've come back just one more time
And drive the blues out of my mind

Well I remember the way that you smile
The way you kiss and your special style
I remember your love for me
The love that I treated so carelessly
And it's drivin' me crazy but what can I do
