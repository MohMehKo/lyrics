All you young cowboys, come gather around
I'll tell you a story of Abilene town
Of two young lovers as true lovers know
The girl in this story is Abilene Rose

Rose, Rose, Abilene Rose
Your memory still lives in my heart
Rose, Abilene Rose
We promised we never would part

Rose was so pretty in her gingham gown
She was the fairest in Abilene town
Her eyes were as bright as the stars up above
Everyone knew when she chose me to love

Rose, Rose, Abilene Rose
Your memory still lives in my heart
Rose, Abilene Rose
We promised we never would part

We courted each other out under the moon
We planned to be married the first days of June
Then I started drinkin' and gamblin', you see
I broke her young heart and then she left me

Rose, Rose, Abilene Rose
Your memory still lives in my heart
Rose, Abilene Rose
We promised we never would part

I got into trouble and had to leave town
Rose got married and then settled down
She was as happy as happy could be
With her young cowboy and their family

Rose, Rose, Abilene Rose
Your memory still lives in my heart
Rose, Abilene Rose
We promised we never would part

This is the story I promised to tell
All you young cowboys, remember it well
If you find true love don't tear it apart
Marry that true love don't break her young heart

Rose, Rose, Abilene Rose
Your memory still lives in my heart
Rose, Abilene Rose
Forever we must live apart
