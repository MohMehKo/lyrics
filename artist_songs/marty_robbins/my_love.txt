My love is the valley,
The breeze as it sighs
My love is the mountains
That reach to the sky.

My love is the valley
The rocks and the rills
My love is the prairie
The low rollin' hills the rollin' hills.

The call of the night bird
I love every trill
There's peace and contentment
When everything's still.

The wail of the coyote
The flight of the dove
It's all God's creation
And that's what I love.

And that's what I love...
