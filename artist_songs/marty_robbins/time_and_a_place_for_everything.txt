There's a time and a place for everything
So let's pretend we're not blue
There's a time and a place for everything
Someday our dreams will come true

They say that just before the dawn
That night is as black as can be-e-e
There's a time and a place for everything
And someday your place will be with me

They say that just before the dawn
That night is as black as can be-e-e
But there's a time and a place for everything
And someday your place will be with me
