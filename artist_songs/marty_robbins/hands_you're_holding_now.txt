The hands you're holdin' now, if you remember
Are the very hands that gave you you're first rose
They're reachin' out for one last dyin' ember
In the ashes of the love that's lost it's glow

But if you don't want me I won't try to keep you
But there's just the smallest chance you may be wrong, so wrong, so wrong
Until you sure I hope you'll never let go
Of the hands that you've been holdin' for so long

I can't forget the first time that I kissed you
It's the sweetest fellin' I have ever known
But every dream, they say, must have an ending
And you leave the hands you're holding for so long

But if you don't want me I won't try to keep you
But there's just the smallest chance you may be wrong, so wrong, so wrong
Until you sure I hope you'll never let go
Of the hands that you've been holdin' for so long
