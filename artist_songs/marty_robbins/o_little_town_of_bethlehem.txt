O, little town of Bethlehem,
how still we see thee lie;
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep,
the silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth,
the everlasting light
the hopes and fears of all the years
are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary
and gather all above
while mortals sleep the angels keep
their watch of wond'ring love!
O, morning stars together
proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God our King
and peace to men on earth!

O, Holy Child of Bethlehem
descend to us we pray
cast out our sin, and enter in,
be born in us today!
We hear the Christmas Angels,
the great glad tidings tell
O, come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emanuel!
