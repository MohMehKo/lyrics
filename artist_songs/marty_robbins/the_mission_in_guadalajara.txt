Today was to be a day of fun and fiesta
The wedding day of Juan and lovely Vanessa
Inside the chapel only the padre remains
Everyone waited but Vanessa she never came.

Oh, only sorrow at the mission in Guadalajara
No fiesta, no laughing, no singing
No wedding bells will be ringing
Only sorrow in Guadalajara.

And every year on that very same day in September
He lights a candle and prays that she will remember
Inside the chapel he begs the padre to stay
He swears Vanessa will surely be here today.

Oh, only sorrow at the mission in Guadalajara
No fiesta, no laughing, no singing
No wedding bells will be ringing
Only sorrow in Guadalajara.
