You treat me like the ground you walk around on
You say our love's not like it was before
And even though you hurt me, when it's over
You know that I'll come runnin' back for more

So I hope you learned a lot from all your heartaches
'Cause their bound to come to you, just wait and see
And I hope you learned a lot from all your heartaches
And when you do I hope that you'll come runnin back to me

Sometimes I think you really like to hurt me
Your only happy when you make me blue
But every time you do I keep remembering
Someday someone will do the same to you

And I hope you learned a lot from all your heartaches
'Cause their bound to come to you, just wait and see
Oh, I hope you learned a lot from all your heartaches
And when you do I hope that you'll come runnin back to me
