Little robin are you ever lonely and blue
Has your lover gone with somebody new
Or will she return when nightime is near
To cuddle up closer and ever so near

You look so lonely up there in the tree
Won't you be friendly and sit here with me
I cry when I see her out walking with him
Like you little robin I'm out on a limb

You look so lonely up there in the tree
Won't you be friendly and sit here with me
I cry when I see her out walking with him
Like you little robin I'm out on a limb
