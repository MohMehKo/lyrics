Restless cattle, stop your millin' round
It's time to go to sleep
While I tell you bout some secrets
This poor cowboy has to keep
You won't understand, but still I'd like
To get it off my chest
Restless cattle, now it's time to get some rest.

If I show you what I carry
Will you promise not to laugh?
If another tear drop falls and stains
Her faded photograph
Only you know how I feel inside
Only you know that I weep
Restless cattle, settle down, it's time to sleep.

What's this, you've stopped your millin'
Can it be you understand
That a cowboy cries like any other man?
Guess my story must have touched you cause You're all standin' around
Restless cattle, now it's time for beddin' down.

Guess my story must have touched you cause
You're all standin' around
