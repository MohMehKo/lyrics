On a long lonesome journey I'm going
Throw your arms 'round my neck and don't cry
Though in shackles and chains they will take me
To a prison to stay til I die 

And at night through the bars I will gaze at the stars
And long for your sweet kiss in vain
A piece of stone I will use for my pillow
While I'm sleeping in shackles and chains 

Put your arms through these bars once my darling
Let me kiss those sweet lips I love best
In heartache you're my consolation
And in sorrow my haven of rest 

And at night through the bars I will gaze at the stars
The plans that we made were in vain
A piece of stone I will use for my pillow
While I'm sleeping in shackles and chains
