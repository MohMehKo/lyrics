Worried, yes I'm worried
Because she just told me goodbye
Tell me what on earth am I to do
Worried, yes I'm worried
Because she just walked out on me
Worried, disappointed, sad and blue

I feel just like I wanna die
I know I've got a right to cry
Lovin' her is all I want to do
Worried, yes I'm worried
And I've got a right to be
She means more than this whole wide world to me

I feel just like I wanna die
I know I've got a right to cry
Lovin' her is all I want to do
Worried, yes I'm worried
And I've got a right to be
She means more than this whole wide world to me
