Yesterday it started all over again
Sittin' in a tavern, talkin' with a friend
Talkin' 'bout a little girl whose love I couldn't win
Had a drink, then I got started on another lost weekend

Well, I told him 'bout her pretty eyes, I had a drink and then
Told him just how sweet she was then had a drink again
Told him how I loved her, that's when it all began
Had a drink, then I got started on another lost weekend

Well, I told him 'bout her golden hair and her lovely smile
Spoke about the happiness I'd known for just a while
Thought about her sweet, sweet lips I'll never kiss again
Had a drink, then I got started on another lost weekend
Told him how I loved her, that's when it all began
Had a drink, then I got started on another lost weekend
