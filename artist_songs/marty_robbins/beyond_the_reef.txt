Beyond the reef where the sea is dark and cold
My love has gone, and my dreams grow old
There'll be no tears, there'll be no regretting
Will she remember me will she forget? 

I'll send a thousand flowers where the trade winds blow
I'll send my lonely heart cause I love her so 

Someday I know she'll come back again to me
Til then my heart will be beyond the reef 

I'll send a thousand flowers where the trade winds blow
I'll send my lonely heart cause I love her so 

I'll send a thousand flowers where the trade winds blow
I'll send my lonely heart cause I love her so
