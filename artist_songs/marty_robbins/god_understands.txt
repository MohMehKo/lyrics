God understands, he knows all about us
He knows of our hopes, he knows of our plans
He's willing to help if we will but follow
He knows all about us, God understands

I walk with the Lord in sunshine and darkness
I cannot forsake his word and command
Temptation is great, his love is still greater
He knows all about us, God understands

I know of his love, I know all it's meaning
I know of the power he's given to man
Without faith in God my life would be worthless
He knows all about us, God understands

When trouble appears and life has no meaning
Be washed and be cleansed in the blood of the Lamb
He's trusted and tried so cast him your worries
He knows all about us, God understands
