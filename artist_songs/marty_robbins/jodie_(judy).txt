You came down out of Heaven to make me happy, dear
To smile away my sorrows and kiss away my tears
Seems that I have loved you though we've never meet before
But now you're in my heart, love, to stay for evermore

You're my angel, Judy, you're my darlin'
You're the sweetest flower that Heaven ever grew
My arms could never hold another
'Cause my love is only for you

The nights were dark and lonely the days were lonely too
But now they're all so bright, love, cause all I see is you
You came into my heart, love, from out of empty space
With a song upon your lips, dear, with a smile upon your face

You're my angel, Judy, you're my darlin'
You're the sweetest flower that Heaven ever grew
My arms could never hold another
'Cause my love is only for you
