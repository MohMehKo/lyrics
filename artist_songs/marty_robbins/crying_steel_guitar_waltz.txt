The steel guitar played when I met her
And it played the night I lost her
Yes, you drove her to another
With your sweet Hawaiian charm's
I know your sorry, but it's too late now
And I know you meant no harm
But the waltz that you were playing
Put her in another's arms

So cry, steel guitar, cry on
You're crying because you know she is gone
Gone with another and I'm alone
So cry, steel guitar, cry on

So cry, steel guitar, cry on
You're crying because you know she is gone
Gone with another and I'm alone
So cry, steel guitar, cry on
