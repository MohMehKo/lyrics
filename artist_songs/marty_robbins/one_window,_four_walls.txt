I once had my freedom and my life before me
Was brighter and sweeter than all words could tell
But I lost it all for the love of a woman
Now I'll spend my life in this cold prison cell

One window, four walls and a door that won't open
That's the only world that I'll ever see
One window, four walls and a door that won't open
The warden takes care of the key

The first time I saw her my friends tried to warn me
But I let her fool me with lips soft and sweet
When I found her there in the arms of another
Just one single shot left her dead at my feet

One window, four walls and a door that won't open
That's the only world that I'll ever see
One window, four walls and a door that won't open
The warden takes care of the key

The jury that tried me would give me no mercy
They said I was guilty, that I had to pay
Behind prison walls and with no hope of freedom
There's nothing to live for, there's no need to pray

One window, four walls and a door that won't open
That's the only world that I'll ever see
One window, four walls and a door that won't open
The warden takes care of the key
