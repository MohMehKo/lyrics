She's just a drifter and she drifts from town to town
She's never been branded and she's never been tied down
She drifts for a while then she might drift back to town
And somethin' keeps callin' she has to move on to new ground

Wild as a prairie wind warm as the hot desert sun
Places she's never seen keeps her from settelin' down
Just like a free runnin' river she rambles and rolls
There highway's her Heaven, she makes the whole world her own

'Cause she's a drifter don't mean that I don't care about her
Sometimes I live with her, sometimes I'm livin' without her
Just when I think that I'm finally beginnin' to tame her
That's when she makes me feel bein' tied down kinda shames her

Down to the ocean, she might stay a while on the beach
Then caught by the high tide she drifts further on out of reach
There's no way a-tellin' how soon you may see her again
Nature's her Mother and that makes her kin to the wind

'Cause she's a drifter don't mean that I don't care about her
Sometimes I live with her, sometimes I'm livin' without her
Just when I think that I'm finally beginnin' to tame her
That's when she makes me feel bein' tied down kinda shames her
