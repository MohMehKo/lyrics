Kuu-ipo-lani my sweetheart from Hawaii
Your hula hands are saying that your lips were only playing a game
We kissed and then you slipped away
To another's arms to stay
Your love awaits he calls your name Kuu-ipo-lani

You're gone the music fades and dies
Still I see your dusky eyes
The surfs and sands are whispering
That your love's a game of kissing
And then you'll do your dance of love once more
On another moonlit shore
I know he'll break your heart someday Kuu-ipo-lani Kuu-ipo-lani
