Give me lots of elbow room but never tie me down
Let me see the mountains over yonder
Give me lots of elbow room but never tie me down
Let me ride and roam and let me wander

Let me see the rivers, let me see the waterfalls
Let me ride until I've seen the beauty of it all
Make me sleep out in the cold upon the dampened ground
But never tie me down

Let me see the rivers, let me see the waterfalls
Let me ride until I've seen the beauty of it all
Make me sleep out in the cold upon the dampened ground
But never tie me down
