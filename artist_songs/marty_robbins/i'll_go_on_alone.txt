We're traveling down two different roads 
In worlds so far apart 
You want me yet there's something else 
Before me in your heart 
You're wanting me to change my life 
The way you're living yours 
But I can't change, I see no way 
You wanted me before 

If you don't want me like I am 
Then please don't pity me 
If you can't change a little bit 
Then why not set me free 
If we can't live together then 
It's best we live apart 
You go your way and I'll go mine 
We'll both make brand new starts 

There's nothing we can do it seems
We'll never get along
With you believin' like you do
You say I live so wrong
But I can't change my way of life
I've lived it much too long
You'll either take me like I am
Or I'll go on alone 

So either say you want my love 
Or take the way you live 
Remember though before you get 
You've got to learn to give 
So if it's change my life or go 
Then go it's gonna be 
'Cause I can't change my life when you 
Want something more than me
