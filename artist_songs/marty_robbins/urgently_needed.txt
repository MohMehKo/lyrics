Urgently needed in my emergency
Someone to mend a broken heart
That heart belongs to me
Urgently needed someone to rescue me
Won't someone save a lonely man
From heartache's misery

I've been the victim of a hit and run affair
Run over by a careless love
Who never really cared
Urgently needed, I'm pleading desperately
Please help me while there's still a chance
Someone hear my plea

Urgently needed, a love that's good and true
A love that I can call my own
It never makes me blue
Urgently needed, lovein' surgery
To put together shattered dreams
And take the hurt from me

I've been the victim of a hit and run affair
Run over by a careless love
Who never really cared
Urgently needed, I'm pleading desperately
Please help me while there's still a chance
Someone hear my plea
