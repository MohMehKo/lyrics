It finally happened like I said it would
This time our breakup is really for good
You kicked and you walked on a heart that was true
It finally happened, I stopped loving you

I've had my cup of hurt
And my face filled with dirt
And every dream I dreamed
Go up in smoke

It finally happened, and this time we're through
It finally happened, and I stopped loving you

I've had my cup of hurt
And my face filled with dirt
And every dream I dreamed
Go up in smoke

It finally happened, and this time we're through
It finally happened, and I stopped loving you
