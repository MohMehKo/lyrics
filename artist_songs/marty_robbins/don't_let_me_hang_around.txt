If you love me let me know if you don't then let me go
Don't let me hang around if you don't care
Life holds nothing, can't you see only doubt and misery
Don't let me hang around if you don't care

Don't offer me your pity it only makes me cry
If you found someone else to love I'll manage to get by
Why do you keep seein' me, is it love or sympathy
Don't let me hang around if you don't care

Can it be that you're in doubt, let me know when you find out
Don't let me hang around if you don't care
Tell me now if I should go, either, yes, or either no
But don't let me hang around if you don't care

You know it's you that I love, dear, so please don't get me wrong
But I deserve an answer, dear, I've waited for so long
I'll leave everything to you, where I go and what I'll do
But don't let me hang around if you don't care
