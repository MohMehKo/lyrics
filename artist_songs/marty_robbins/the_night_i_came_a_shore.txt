I fell in love the night I came ashore
You're what I'd wanted what I'd waited for
I built my dreams too high it seems that now
The things I wanted turned out wrong somehow

The dawn will find me sailing back to sea
But I when I sail I'll leave a part of me
Though you're untrue what can I do I love you
I can't forget you o'er the night I came ashore

The dawn will find me sailing back to sea
But I when I sail I'll leave a part of me
Though you're untrue what can I do I love you
I can't forget you o'er the night I came ashore
