One starry night in a little town in old Mexico
I found my love down by the sea where soft trade winds blow
She came in the night with perfume that sweetened the air
And I lost my heart to the girl with gardenias in her hair
I glanced her way she smiled and my heart started to sing
She came into my arms and the night became a sweet magic thing
When I held her close I knew I'd follow her anywhere
And I lost my heart to the girl with gardenias in her hair
We shared through the night our love until the first light of dawn
Then one last kiss and like a whisper on the wind she was gone
I go each night to the places where she once spoke my name
Some call me fool they say I'm chasing only a dream
But I know one day I'll turn and suddenly she'll be there
And I'll spend my life with the girl with gardenias in her hair
