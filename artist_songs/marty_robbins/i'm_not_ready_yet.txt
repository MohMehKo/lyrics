Always knew you'd find another
And my way of life I'd have to rearrange
Thought I'd give when you were ready
Now I find it very hard to make the change

It's all over now
I'll make the change somehow
I'll get over you
What else is there to do
Though I'm not ready yet
I know I must forget
I'll make the change somehow
Though I'm not ready now

I'm surprised, I thought I'd make it
I've been trainin' for this day a long, long time 
Now I find that I'm not ready
To accept the fact that you're no longer mine

It's all over now
I'll make the change somehow
I'll get over you
What else is there to do
Though I'm not ready yet
I know I must forget
I'll make the change somehow
Though I'm not ready now
