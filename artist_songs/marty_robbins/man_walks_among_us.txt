Warm are the winds on the desert
A whirlwind is dancing around
I stop to survey all the beauty that's here
When a shadow moves out 'cross the ground

It's an eagle that circles above me
And he screams to his friends on the hill
"Stay close together, move not a feather
Man walks among us, be still, be still
Man walks among us, be still"

Everything hides, but I see them
I've spotted an old mother quail
I look close and see, looking right back at me
The eyes of a young cottontail
I see a coyote sneaking
As he crawls through the brush on the hill
And the eagle screams down, "Stay close to the ground
Man walks among us, be still, be still
Man walks among us, be still."

Twenty feet high in the side of a cactus
I see a hole where the butcher bird stays
If mortals could choose, and if heaven should ask us
Here's where I'd want to spend all of my days

Soon will be gone all the desert
Cities will cover each hill
Today will just be a fond memory
Man walks among us, be still, be still
Man walks among us, be still.
