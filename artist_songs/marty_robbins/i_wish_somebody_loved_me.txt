I wish somebody loved me just enough to say they care
I wish somebody loved me enough to call me dear
I wish someone would care enough to tell me they were true
I wish somebody loved me somebody just like you

I wish someone would care enough to tell me they were mine
But when I think I've found true love they leave me here behind
Why do they have to take and break a heart that could be true
I wish somebody loved me somebody just like you

I wish that you could understand the love I have for you
But like the others though, I guess, you leave me feelin' blue
I'm feelin' bad I'm feelin' sad I'm feelin' low and blue
I wish somebody loved me somebody just like you

The kindest heart the truest love is all that I can give
And if you shouldn't want my love why should I wanna live
The road of life and love, sweetheart, has been unkind and cruel
I wish somebody loved me somebody just like you
