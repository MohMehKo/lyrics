I've been makin' excuses ever since you went away
Makin' excuses to my heart
I'm usin' alibis to cover up for all those lies
You've been tellin' me right from the start

Makin' excuses for the times you let me down
I guess I learned a lot from you
Makin' excuses every time you came around
That's all you knew how to do

Now that you're gone I find
That I can't keep an open mind
So I'm makin' excuses to my heart

Makin' excuses for the times you let me down
I guess I learned a lot from you
Makin' excuses every time you came around
That's all you knew how to do

Now that you're gone I find
That I can't keep an open mind
So I'm makin' excuses to my heart
