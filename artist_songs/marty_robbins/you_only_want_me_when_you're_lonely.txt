You only want me when you're lonely
When no one else wants you, it seems
And even though you call me darlin'
I know I'm never in your dreams

I'm just someone you always turn to
Each time your new love turns you down
You only want me when you're lonely
When there's nobody else around

You only want me when you're lonely
I only see you now and then
And though I'm sayin' I won't forget you
I'm glad when you come back again

Why do I let you fool me, darlin,
The way you break my heart's a crime
You only want me when you're lonely
But, dear, I want you all the time
