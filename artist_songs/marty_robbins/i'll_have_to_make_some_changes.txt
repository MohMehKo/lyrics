Well, I've got to forget you if I'm goin' to survive
You're memory's slowly killin' me, it's killin' me alive
Well, you're too much woman to forget in just a day or two
And I'll have to make some changes
If I'm gonna get over you

I've gotta try and love someone
Who doesn't look like you
Who doesn't do love's little things
The way we used to do

Well, I'm a-lookin' for a way out of this prison that we built
This kinda life is filled with heartaches, memories and guilt
Well, I've gotta smother all the things that make me think of you
And I'll have to make some changes
If I'm gonna get over you

I've gotta try and love someone
Who doesn't look like you
Who doesn't do love's little things
The way we used to do

Well, I'm a-lookin' for a way out of this prison that we built
This kinda life is filled with heartaches, memories and guilt
Well, I've gotta smother all the things that make me think of you
And I'll have to make some changes
If I'm gonna get over you
Yes, I'll have to make some changes
If I'm gonna get over you
