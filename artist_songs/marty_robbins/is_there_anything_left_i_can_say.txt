Is there anything left I can say
To make life like it was yesterday
Is there any way you can forgive
'Cause without my heart couldn't live

If a small, tiny spark lives within
Watch it close, it may burn bright again
I beg you to come back today
Is there anything left I can say

I beg you to come back today
Is there anything left I can say
