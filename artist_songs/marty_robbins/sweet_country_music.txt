Well, I've been on that road for thirty days
My head's been spinnin' around
I've been livin' up in a daze
I can't help it if I love it (can't help it)
Lord, you know it's in my veins (yeah)
Well, that sweet country music's
Gonna drive my blues away (drive my blues away) (drive my blues away)

You might have seen us down in Atlanta
Playin' all night long
Sun came up next mornin' we was still goin' strong
I can't help it if I love it (can't help it)
Lord, you know it's in my veins, yeah
And that sweet country music's
Gonna drive my blues away (drive my blues away) (drive my blues away)

Somethin' comes all over me when I'm a-doin' a show
Somethin' about that music, Lord,
And it won't let me go
I can't help it if I love it (can't help it)
Lord, you know it's in my veins, yeah
Well, that sweet country music's
Gonna drive my blues away (drive my blues away)

When I hear that crowd a-cheerin' my blood gets hot
The band keeps on a-playin', Lord,
And I, I don't wanna stop
I can't help it if I love it (can't help it)
Lord, you know it's in my veins, yeah
Well, that sweet country music's
Gonna drive my blues away (drive my blues away) (drive then away)
Well, that sweet country music's
Gonna drive my blues away (drive my blues away) (drive my blues away)
