A lonely wife had written a letter one sad day
To the one she loved who'd wandered far away
And her teardrops fell like rain falling on the window pane
Them she read the note and this it had to say

If you love me come and stay
If you don't, please stay away
Either love me or leave me alone
Don't come back and say you'll stay
If you plan to leave someday
Either love me or leave me alone

I can't stand this grief and strife
Sick with heartache, sick with fright
Since we've married you've left me to roam
I have led a lonely life
Since you took me for your wife
Either love me or leave me alone

Love me now or say goodbye
Don't come back and live a lie
You must love me or leave me alone
Love like yours just can't be true
But I'm still in love with you
You must love me or leave me alone

If you love me come and stay
If you don't, please stay away
Either love me or leave me alone
Don't come back and say you'll stay
If you plan to leave someday
Either love me or leave me alone
