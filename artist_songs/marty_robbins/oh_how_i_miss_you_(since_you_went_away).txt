Oh how I miss you since you went away
Oh how I need you more every day
I'll be so happy when you're back to stay
Oh how I miss you since you went away

I lost my sunshine the day you went away
All of my blue skies have turned into gray
I'm so heartbroken that's all I can say
Oh how I miss you since you went away

I miss your blue eyes your sweet smiling face
No one on earth dear can ever take your place
Don't think I'm fooling when you, hear me say
Oh how I miss you since you went away...
