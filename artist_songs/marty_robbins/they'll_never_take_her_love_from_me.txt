If today the sun should set on all my hopes and cares
There is one who's smiling face the Gods would see
Cause she'll walk along beside me up those golden stairs
Oh they'll never never take her love from me

I thought I'd make her happy if I'd step aside
But I knew her love would never set me free
And even on the morning she became another's bride
I said they'd never never take her love from me

I'm so thankful for each golden hour of happiness
That we shared together in the used to be
Though another's arms may hold her now in fond embrace
I said they'd never never take her love from me

I thought I'd make her happy if I'd step aside
But I knew her love would never set me free
And even on the morning she became another's bride
I said they'd never never take her love from me
