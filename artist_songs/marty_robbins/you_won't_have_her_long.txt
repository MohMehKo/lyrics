You didn't have to have your friends to tell me
That the love she once had for me is gone
They say she's yours and for a while she will be
You've got her now but you won't have her long

Don't talk too loud her love is immitation
Don't walk too proud for soon you'll walk alone
You're happy now but soon they'll hear you saying
You've got her now but you won't have her long

If you think you own the world you're only dreamin'
And you'll wake up soon and find your dream is gone
You'll find, to her, your heart is just a plaything
You've got her now but you won't have her long

Don't talk too loud her love is immitation
Don't walk too proud for soon you'll walk alone
You're happy now but soon they'll hear you saying
You've got her now but you won't have her long
