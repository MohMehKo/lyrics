Change the dial, turn off that song
It reminds me of somethin' I've done
Somethin' so wrong

Once I had a real true love
And she was good to me
I cheated and she found out
Then she left me
We used to sing that same old song
It seemed we loved it so
Now I can't stand to hear it
Because it hurts me so

Change the dial, turn off that song
It reminds me of somethin' I've done
Somethin' so wrong

We sang that song so many times
When she was here with me
When both of us were just as one
Before she set me free
It tells about a boy and girl
Both so much in love
What made me step across the line
What was I thinkin' of

Change the dial, turn off that song
It reminds me of somethin' I've done
Somethin' so wrong
