Oh, I need you to hold me together
When I feel like I'm falling apart
I need you to hold me together
Till I gain control of my heart

Darlin', you are the one that can help me
And you are the one I can trust
'Cause I've been through some nights bein' lonely
And I've seen how dreams turn into dust

But with you it's been so different
You brought me sweet love again
Be kind to my heart, don't let love fall apart
When it's about to begin

I need you to hold me together
When I feel like I'm falling apart
Yes I need you to hold me together
Till I gain control of my heart

But with you it's been so different
You brought me sweet love again
Be kind to my heart, don't let love fall apart
When it's about to begin

I need you to hold me together
When I feel like I'm falling apart
Yes I need you to hold me together
Till I gain control of my heart
Till I gain control of my heart
