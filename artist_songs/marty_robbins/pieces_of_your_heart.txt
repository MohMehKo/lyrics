Today we start all over
We break the tie that binds
I don't agree but you think we should part
Tho I won't try to stop you
I'll follow close behind
And pick up tiny pieces of your heart

If you believe you love him and want him more than me
Then I won't try to keep you two apart
But if your love can't hold him
Look close and you will see
Me, picking up the pieces of your heart

But if he decides he doesn't want you
Will mem'ries from the past make teardrops start

Then will you be happy
I followed close behind
To pick up tiny pieces of your heart

[Instrumental]

But if he decides he doesn't want you
Will mem'ries from the past make teardrops start
Then will you be happy
I followed close behind
To pick up tiny pieces of your heart
