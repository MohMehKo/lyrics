You only want me 'round
When someone turns you down
You always think of me
As just a friend in need
I wish you were my own
But still I'm all alone
So why keep wishin'
When I know that you don't care

Each time your new love strays
I think you're back to stay
But then you go away
And leave me so lonely
I guess it just can't be
You're not in love with me
So why keep wishin'
When I know that you don't care

Each time your new love strays
I think you're back to stay
But then you go away
And leave me so lonely
I guess it just can't be
You're not in love with me
So why keep wishin'
When I know that you don't care
