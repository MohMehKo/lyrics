Just like all the other times you leave leaving me alone here to grieve
Begging you to stay but still you go this time you won't be back I know
Just like all the other times I cry had that same old hurt deep down inside
Lonely nights for me are nothing new lonely every night since I lost you
It's my fault because I've lost but I just couldn't see
If I'd been a man I should you'd still be here with me
But I guess it's always been this way when you break a heart you have'll to pay
Life will be so empty from now on just like all the other times you've gone

It's my fault because I've lost...
Just like all the other times you've gone
