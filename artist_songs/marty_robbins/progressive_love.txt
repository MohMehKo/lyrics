Little by little, step by step
Slowly but surely we fell in love
How did it happen, it's easy to see
We didn't rush things, we loved progressively

First came a smile and then we held hands
Much later came the kiss
If you'll just take your time
If you search then you'll find
Progressive love won't miss

If you'll just take your time
If you search then you'll find
Progressive love can't miss
