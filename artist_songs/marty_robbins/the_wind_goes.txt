Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooh-ooh
The winds are set today
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooh-ooh
Since you went away
There is no gladness
Since there's no you
The winds go
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

How very strange that I
Find comfort when I lie
And tell my heart that she
Belongs to me
But, still, the winds know
Because the winds go
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
