Don't sing aloha when I go
Because I'm comming back you know
Don't sing aloha though I cry
Our parting does not mean goodbye

I'll dream of you in Waikiki
That's where I'll always long to be
Just smile and say you'll miss me so
Don't sing aloha when I go

Don't sing aloha when I go
Because I'm comming back you know
Don't sing aloha though I cry
Our parting does not mean goodbye

I'll dream of you in Waikiki
That's where I'll always long to be
Just smile and say you'll miss me so
Don't sing aloha when I go
