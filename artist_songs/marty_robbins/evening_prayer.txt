If I have wounded any soul today if I have caused one foot to go astray
If I have walked in my own willful way dear Lord forgive

If I have uttered idol words or vain if I have turned aside from want or pain
Last I myself shall suffer through the strain dear Lord forgive

Forgive the sins I have confessed to Thee forgive the secret sins I do not see
Oh guide me love me and my keeper be dear Lord forgive

If I have wounded any soul today...
