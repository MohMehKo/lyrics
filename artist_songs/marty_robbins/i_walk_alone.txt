I walk alone where once we wandered
It seems so strange that you are gone
Till you return I'll stay the same, dear
I'll still be true and walk alone

Flame of love is brightly burnin'
You know that I'm your very own
Until you return I'll stay the same, dear
And I'll still be true and walk alone

Flame of love is brightly burnin'
You know that I'm your very own
Until you return I'll stay the same, dear
And I'll still be true and walk alone
