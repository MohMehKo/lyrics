When the dews of the evening are falling
Glistening on the flowers loved so well
Then my heart to thee is calling
From my place within the dell

My heart, oh sweet, is there forever
It thrills with love for thee alone
It's constancy fades never
I'll be ever true to thee, my own

When the dews of the evening are falling
Glistening on the flowers loved so well
Then my heart to thee is calling
From my place within the dell

My heart, oh sweet, is there forever
It thrills with love for thee alone
It's constancy fades never
I'll be ever true to thee, my own
