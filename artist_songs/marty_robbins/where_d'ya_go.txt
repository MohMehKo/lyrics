How long will it be 'til I see my baby
This waitin' here is drivin' me crazy
Where d'ya go, when are ya commin' back
I treated ya good like a good man should
Oh, ya left me here, that ain't good, oh
Where d'ya go, when are ya commin' back
Commin' back

When will I see those lovin' eyes
That used to look at me
I long to feel those lovin' arms
That held me tenderly
If you ain't back in a little more time, oh
I think I'll leave this world behind, oh
Where d'ya go, when are ya commin' back
Commin' back

How long will it be 'til I see my baby
This waitin' here is drivin' me crazy
Where d'ya go, when are ya commin' back
I treated ya good like a good man should
Oh, ya left me here, that ain't good, oh
Where d'ya go, when are ya commin' back
Commin' back

When will I see those lovin' eyes
That used to look at me
I long to feel those lovin' arms
That held me tenderly
If you ain't back in a little more time, oh
I think I'll leave this world behind, oh
Where d'ya go, when are ya commin' back
Commin' back
