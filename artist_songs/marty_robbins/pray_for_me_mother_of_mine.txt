I've gained wealth and fame though I'm not satisfied
Oh, pray for me, Mother of mine
My footsteps have strayed from the straight narrow way
Oh, pray for me, Mother of mine

As you hear me singing I know you'll be blue
But I wrote this song, Mom, especially for you
I know I don't write you as much as I should
But pray for me, Mother of mine

Remember the times when you'd take me to church
When I was a small, little boy
How well I remember the songs I would sing
It fills your dear heart full of joy

I'm weary and tired, Mom, I want you to know
That I need your prayers as I did long ago
So kneel down and pray that I might find the way
Oh, pray for me, Mother of mine
