I was standing by my window on a cold cold cloudy day
When I saw that hearse come rolling for to carry my mother away

Will the circle be unbroken by and by Lord by and by
There's a better home awaiting in the sky Lord in the sky

I said Mister undertaker undertaker please go slow
Cause the woman that you're taking oh well I hates hates to see her go

Will the circle be unbroken in the sky Lord in the sky
There's a better home awaiting in the sky Lord in the sky
