Born in the heat of the desert
My mother died giving me life 
Despised and disliked by my father 
Blamed for the loss of his wife 
You know Lord I've been to a prison 
For something that I'd never done 
It's been one hill after another 
And I've climbed them Lord, one by one 

But this time you gave me a mountain 
A mountain I may never climb 
It isn't a hill any longer 
You gave me a mountain this time 

My woman got tired of the hardships 
Tired of the grief and the strife 
Tired of working for nothing 
Tired of being my wife 
She took my one ray of sunshine 
She took my pride and my joy 
She took my reason for living 
She took my small baby boy 

And this time you gave me a mountain 
A mountain I may never climb 
It isn't a hill any longer 
You gave me a mountain this time
