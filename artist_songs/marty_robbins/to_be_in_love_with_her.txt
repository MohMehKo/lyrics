Some people say that she's really no good
Others have said she drinks more than she should
And that it's hopeless and really no good
To be in love with her

She got the worst of a careless romance
Love's little arrow was more like a lance
But still I'm happy and I'm glad for the chance
To be in love with her

She tells too many jokes she takes too many smokes
Spends her money much too fast
She still has her pride and she's only tryin' to hide
Disappointments of the past

Maybe she's seen with the wrong kind of crowd
Maybe she laughs just a little too loud
I know she's good and I know that I'm proud
To be in love with her
