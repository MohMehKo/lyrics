Take me out of this prison
Back to the clear blue sky
Take me back to the part where this cowboy's heart
Wants to live till I die

Take me back to the prairie
Away from these cold prison bars
By a campfire's gleam let me lie there and dream
Under a blanket of stars

Where each mountain top wears a halo
Of fleecy white clouds overhead
Where symphonys ring from birds on the wing
And the grass is like a soft feather bed

Take me back to the prairie
Back to the land I love best
So that when I am gone I'll be where I belong
There in my haven of rest
