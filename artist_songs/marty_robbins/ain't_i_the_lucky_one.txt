Ain't I the lucky one
Look what I've gone and done
I let her steal my heart
I know we'll never part
She brings me joy, so much fun
Ain't I the lucky one 

Well ain't I a happy man
She lets me hold her hand
And when the lights are low
She never tells me no
She's so sweet, so much fun
Ain't I the lucky one 

Well ain't I a doing fine
I'm gaining all the time
I like to hang around
After the sun goes down 

Big blue eyes, hair of blonde
Ain't I the lucky one 

Ain't I the lucky one
Feel like a son of a gun
I've got a perfect doll
She really drives me wild
She's so sweet so much fun
Ain't I the lucky one 

Well ain't I the lucky one
Look what I've gone and done
I let her steal my heart
I know we'll never part
She brings me joy, so much fun
Ain't I the lucky one
