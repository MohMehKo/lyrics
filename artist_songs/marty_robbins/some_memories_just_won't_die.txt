You say it's over
You way it's through
It was a long long time ago
And he means nothing to you
Oh but I heard you whisper
Someone's name in your sleep last night
Baby admit it
Some memories just won't die

Oh some memories just won't die
Some feelings just won't leave
Oh no matter how hard you try
And I know every now and then
You still think of him
I see it in your eyes
Some memories just won't die

I thought my loving
Would help you forget
But something tells me
You're not over him yet
Something's haunting you
Way down deep inside
Am I losing you
To a memory that won't die

And some memories just won't die
Some feelings just won't leave
Oh no matter how hard you try
And I know every now and then
You still think of him
I see it in your eyes
Some memories just won't die
