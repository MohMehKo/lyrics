Today I was lonely so I took a walk
And I happened to glance in a tree
Out on a limb was one lonely dove
It kinda reminds me of me

I looked at the sidewalk as I walked along
We were two of a kind I could see
Because it's been stepped on the way that I have
It kinda reminds me of me

Out on a limb since you left me that day
I live in the sweet used to be
I've heard it said that a fool never learns
It kinda reminds me of me

Out on a limb since you left me that day
I live in the sweet used to be
And I've heard it said that a fool never learns
It kinda reminds me of me
