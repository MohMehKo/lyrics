Sweet Leilani, heavenly flower
Nature fashioned roses kissed with dew
And then she placed them in a flower
And that was the start of you

Sweet Leilani, heavenly flower
Tropic skies are jealous as they shine
I think they're jealous of your blue eyes
I think they're jealous 'cause you're mine

Sweet Leilani, heavenly flower
I dream of Paradise for two
I dream of Paradise complete here
You are my dream come true
