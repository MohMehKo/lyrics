I watched as he held her and kissed her goodnight
Heard every word as I stood out of sight
Just like a fool everything he believed
Nothin' but sweet lies she once told to me

Foolhearted boy, should I tell what I know
Just how she'll win love and then let it go
Too much in love and too far gone to see
It's only sweet lies she once told to me

Once he starts fallin' he won't wanna stop
She'll build him up high and then let him drop
Down with the others who never could see
It's only sweet lies she once told to me

Once he starts fallin' he won't wanna stop
She'll build him up high and then let him drop
Down with the others who never could see
It's only sweet lies she once told to me
