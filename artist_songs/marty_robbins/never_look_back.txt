Never look back, you're decision you've made
Never look back, close your eyes, walk away
Never look back, hold your head way up high
Never look back you never could hide the tears in your eyes

Heaven has ended all your sweet dreams are gone
You must forget him though the hurt may live on
Start life all over though the future looks black
You've known so long, to love him was wrong so never look back

Heaven has ended all your sweet dreams are gone
You must forget him though the hurt may live on
Start life all over though the future looks black
You've known so long, to love him was wrong so never look back
