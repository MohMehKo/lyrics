The field is my home where I work mighty hard
I stand in the shade of Heaven's reward
I'm happy and free 'cause
I've got a, a woman's love

She stands by my side through worry and care
Willin' to give, willin' to share
I'm happy and free 'cause
I've got a, a woman's love

There's bread on our table, and rest in our bed
Plenty of courage to face what's ahead
She gives me contenment when my day is done
Gave me a daughter, gave me a son

My cotton is white, there's gold in the grain
I got nothin' to lose and plenty to gain
I'm happy and free 'cause
I've got a, a woman's love
