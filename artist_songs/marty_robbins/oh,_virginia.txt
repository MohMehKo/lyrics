How many roses have faded and died, Virginia
How many tears since I've walked by your side, Virginia
Too many moonlights have come and gone
Too man sunups and too many sundowns
Too many teardrops and too many roses have died

I'm like I was, sad like the day we parted
I'm just the same, lonely and still broken-hearted
Maybe I'm older but nothing is changed
Love grows no colder, I still feel the same
Life has been empty, but I've learned to live it, Virginia

Oh, Virginia
When will I stop loving you, will it go on forever
Oh, Virginia
When will these dreams that I dream of you stop, maybe never
How many times when your vision appears
I've tried to hold you and you disappear
And I find that the arms that once held you are empty, Virginia

How many times have I seen in the sky, Virginia
One lonely dove as it goes flyin' by, Virginia
I'm like the dove as it flies through the blue
One mate it chooses, and if it should lose
It remains lonely, and that's how I'm livin', Virginia

Oh, Virginia
When will I stop loving you, will it go on forever
Oh, Virginia
When will these dreams that I dream of you stop, maybe never
How many times when your vision appears
I've tried to hold you and you disappear
And I find that the arms that once held you are empty, Virginia
