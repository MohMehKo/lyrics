Don't make me ashamed of things that you say or do
Don't make me regret that I fell in love with you
I'm pleading with you to love, honor and obey
Though others may tempt you remember our wedding day

And should others tempt you by tellin' you lies
Their love can mean nothing it's just a disguise
Don't make me ashamed of things that you say or do
Don't make me regret that I fell in love with you

And should others tempt you by tellin' you lies
Their love can mean nothing it's just a disguise
Don't make me ashamed of things that you say or do
Don't make me regret that I fell in love with you
