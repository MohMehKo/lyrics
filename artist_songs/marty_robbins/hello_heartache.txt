Hello heartache I should have known you'd come my way
Since she left me all my dreams have gone astray
She was all I had to live for now my every hope is gone
So I guess you'll be here with me from now on.

Hello teardrops why do you fall like winter rain
It's too late now for she won't be back again
And there's nothing you can do to ease this longing in my heart
For I'll miss her just as long as we're apart.

For a while I thought she loved me all of that is over now
And I tried to make her happy but I failed her somewhere somehow 
Hello grey skies where are the shining stars above
Do you miss them as I'll always miss my love.

If you do then I'll stay with you all night long until the dawn
For I know that I can't sleep now that she's gone.

For a while I thought she loved me all of that is over now
And I tried to make her happy but I failed her somewhere somehow 
Hello grey skies where are the shining stars above
Do you miss them as I'll always miss my love...
