In my wanderin' days I wandered south of the border
I ended up in a little Mexican town
Was there I met a lovely senorita
There she offered her heart if I promised I'd settle down

Love beyond compare, eternally happy
This could have been but I just had to wander instead
As I rode away, with tears in her eyes she was pleading
I can still see her tears, I can still hear the words she said

Don't go away, Senor, don't go away
Don't go away, Senor, don't go away
Don't go away, don't go away

Guess my wanderin' is through, I just can't forget her
My love for her keeps hurting deep down within
There's nothin' to do but ride back south of the border
And beg her forgiveness and never wander again

Don't go away, Senor, don't go away
Don't go away, Senor, don't go away
Don't go away, don't go away
