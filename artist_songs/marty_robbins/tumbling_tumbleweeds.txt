See then tumbling down
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with a tumbling tumbleweed

I'm a rovin' cowboy ridin' all day long
Tumbleweeds around me sing their lonely song
Nights underneath the prairie moon
I'll ride along and sing a tune

See then tumbling down
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with a tumbling tumbleweed

Cares of the past are behind
Nowhere to go but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind
Drifting along with a tumbling tumbleweed

I know when night is gone
That a new world's born at dawn

I'll keep rolling along
Deep in my heart is a song
Here on the range I belong
Drifting along with a tumbling tumbleweed
