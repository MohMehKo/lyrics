The days of my youth I remember so well
We lived in a world all our own
Nobody cared where my money came from
If I had it I wasn't alone

Oh, the wine flowed freely and friendship was mine
How they all loved me back then
But here in my prison I'm sitting alone
And now where are all of my friends

So drink and be merry if that is your wish
Your souls, to the Lord, I commend
Remember some day you may be as I am
With nothing, not even a friend

Oh, the wine flowed freely and friendship was mine
How they all loved me back then
But here in my prison I'm sitting alone
And now where are all of my friends

So here's to the freedom I never will have
For me it's not long to the end
But it's better to die then to spend forty years
With the cold prison walls for a friend

Oh, the wine flowed freely and friendship was mine
How they all loved me back then
But here in my prison I'm sitting alone
And now where are all of my friends
