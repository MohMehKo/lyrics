(Too young to really be in love)
(But old enough to cry)

Too young to think of marriage
You've been told and so have I
Too young to really be in love
But old enough to cry
I know because we both cried
When they said we'd have to wait
And that we must be satisfied
With a once a week date

The time we spent together
I'm so happy I could cry
It only lasts a little while
And then we say goodbye
Till they believe we're old enough
I suppose we'll have to wait
But they can't change the way we feel
With a once a week date

(Just a once a week date)
