Well, some folks like the summertime
When they can walk about
Strollin' through the meadow green
Well, it's plesant, there's no doubt
Give me the wintertime when
The snow is on the ground
'Cause I found her when
The snow was on the ground

I found a-little footprints in the snow-ow-ow-low-ow
Found a-little footprints in the snow-ow-ow-low-ow
Bless that happy day that Nellie lost her way
'Cause I found her when
The snow was on the ground

When I dropped in to see her
Was a yellow moon
Her Mamma said, she just stepped out
Be returnin' soon-on
I found her little footprints
And I traced them through the snow
And I found her when
The snow was on the ground

I found a-little footprints in the snow-ow-ow-low-ow
Found a-little footprints in the snow-ow-ow-low-ow
Bless that happy day that Nellie lost her way
Why?, 'cause I found her when
The snow was on the ground

Well, now she's up in Heaven
With an angel band
I know I'm gonna see her
In that promised land
Every time the snow falls
Well, it brings back memories
I found her when
The snow was on the ground

I found a-little footprints in the snow-ow-ow-low-ow
Found a-little footprints in the snow-ow-ow-low-ow
Bless that happy day that Nellie lost her way
'Cause I found her when
The snow was on the ground
