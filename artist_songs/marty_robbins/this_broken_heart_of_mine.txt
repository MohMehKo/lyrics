Pictures for my souvineers
Old love letters stained with tears
Memories of someone I cannot forget
Though the love we shared is gone
Sweetest dreams still linger on
And I still love you just the same as when we met

Someone else took you away
Even though I prayed and prayed
Still you left me and the truest love behind
Someone else with many charms
Took you from my lovin' arms
But they can't take you from this broken heart of mine

I'd give anything to hear
Those lovin' words again, my dear
From the sweetest lips that I have ever kissed
I'd give anything if I
Could remember not to cry
When I see somebody else sharin' your kiss

Someone else took you away
Even though I prayed and prayed
Still you left me and the truest love behind
Someone else with many charms
Took you from my lovin' arms
But they can't take you from this broken heart of mine
