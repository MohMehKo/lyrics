I don't ask you, Lord, to lighten up my burden
I don't mind the trials on earth that I go through
Bein' down, I want to prove that I am worthy
Of a little spot in Heaven close to you

Years ago my Mother taught me all your meaning
Of the hardship and the pain that you went through
Know you, Lord, that I am ready and I'm waiting
For a little spot in Heaven close to you

Precious Lord, forget me not don't pass me by
Though there must be others worthier than I
If you can then, Lord, here's what I'll have you do
Save a little spot in Heaven close to you

If my wish is more than I deserve, forgive me
Up in Heaven any place would surely do
But I've done my best on earth that's why I'm asking
For a little spot in Heaven close to you

At the altar years ago we got aquainted
And as time went on the love in my heart grew
If it isn't asking too much, Lord, then save me
Just a little spot in Heaven close to you
