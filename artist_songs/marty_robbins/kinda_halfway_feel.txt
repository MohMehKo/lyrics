(Kinda halfway feel that you and I are through)

Here I am and I'm alone and feeling lonely
Bothered by the thought that someone's holding you
Disappointed and I'm wanting your kiss only
Kinda halfway feel that you and I are through.

I play the jukebox and I set you halfway hoping you'll walk in
And halfway knowing that you won't be by yourself
There's such a feeling in my heart I halfway face the truth
Kinda halfway feel that you want someone else.

At a table where you used to sit beside me
In a corner that we felt was all our own
So in love that my heart's breaking up inside me
It's a different world when you're left alone.

I play the jukebox and I set you halfway hoping you'll walk in
And halfway knowing that you won't be by yourself
There's such a feeling in my heart I halfway face the truth
Kinda halfway feel that you want someone else...
