Moonland, a summer's evenin' in June land
An old familiar tune land
Is Paradise to me
My land, a twinkling star filled sky land
A simple, peaceful island
Across the silver sea

Yonder where native lovers wander
Lost in eternity
Moonland, a summer's evenin' in June land
An old familiar tune land
Is Paradise to me

Yonder where native lovers wander
Lost in eternity
Moonland, a summer's evenin' in June land
An old familiar tune land
Is Paradise for me
