Ninety days since the country's seen a drop of rain
Forty-four since the grass began to burn
Thristy cattle are millin' round the old creek bed
Dusty winds where the waters used to churn

Dusty winds, hear them blow
Dusty winds, moanin' low
Night and day on they go
Those dusty winds

Not a cloud in the sky but still the sun shines dim
But enough to turn the scenery dark and brown
Lookin' Westward is a dust cloud loomin' high in the sky
Shows the trail of fifty settlers leavin' town

Dusty winds, hear them blow
Dusty winds, moanin' low
Night and day on they go
Those dusty winds

When it's late in the evenin', in my cabin all alone
It's so lonesome when that wind comes howlin' through
And I think of all the settlers headin' West out of town
Kinda wished I'd have left here with them too

Dusty winds, hear them blow
Dusty winds, moanin' low
Night and day on they go
Those dusty winds
