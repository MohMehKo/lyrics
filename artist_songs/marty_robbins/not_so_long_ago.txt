Not so long ago, she cared for me 
I was young and acted foolishly 
Broke her heart, caused us to part 
Once upon a time 

Unconcerned, I let her slip away 
In my sorrow, now I curse the day 
I broke her heart, caused us to part 
Once upon a time 

Once upon a time, I must confess 
In my reach was complete happiness 
Didn't know that I was really livin' 
Once upon a time 

Now another kisses her goodnight 
She was mine, and would be mine tonight 
If I'd only done a little givin' 
Once upon a time 

Once upon a time, 
I laughed, the night, she said, This is the end 
Made her cry in front of all her friends 

Acted smart, and broke her heart 
Once upon a time 

I remember what I told the crowd 
Let her go, I even yelled it loud 
I talked a lot, and lost a lot 
Once upon a time 

Gone forever, never to return 
Is the love that once so brightly burned 
I remember once upon a time 
How much I used to brag 

Like so many little grains of sand 
I let her slip through my foolish hands 
And before I knew it, love had turned 
From riches back to rags 

Once upon a time she was my love.
