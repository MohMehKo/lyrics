Who at my door is standing patiently drawing near
In trance within demanding who is the voice I hear

Sweet leader tones are falling open the door for me
If Thou will heed Thy calling I will abide with Thee

Lonely without he standing lonely within am I
While I am still delaying will he not pass me by

Sweet leader tones are falling open the door for me
If Thou will heed Thy calling I will abide with Thee
