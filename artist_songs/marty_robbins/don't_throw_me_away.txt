Don't be foolish
Don't, don't throw me away
Keep me around
Just for keeps, dear
You might need a laugh someday, oh

Love is unpredictable
At least I've heard people say
Keep me around
Just for keeps, dear
You might need a laugh someday, oh

I've learned how to smile and pretend
When my heart wants me to cry
You may have to learn
How to hide tears that burn
And who could teach better than I, oh

Don't be foolish
Don't, don't throw me away
Keep me around
Just for keeps, dear
You might need a laugh someday, oh
