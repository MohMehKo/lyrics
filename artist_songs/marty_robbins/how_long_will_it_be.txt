How long will it be before I hold you tight
Oh darlin', how long will it be
If you knew how my arms long to hold you each night
Oh darlin', how long will it be

Will it be just a while or a long, long time
Long as my heart knows, then everything is fine
I'll wait just as long as these eyes of mine can see
A vision of you but how long will it be

Will it be just a while or a long, long time
Long as my heart knows, then everything is fine
I'll wait just as long as these eyes of mine can see
A vision of you but how long will it be
