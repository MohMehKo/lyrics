The city streets are friendless and cold
I walk them mile after mile
I'm a country boy a-singin' the blues
The blues, country style.

Nobody stops to tell me hello
Not even one friendly smile
I'm a country boy alone with the blues
The blues, country style.

One hundred tears make one city block
Two thousand tears make a mile
I'm a country boy with miles of blues
The blues, country style.

Tonight, in dreams, I'm goin' back home
And I'll be happy awhile
But I know at dawn, I wake with the blues
The blues, country style.

I'm a country boy a-singin' the blues
The blues, country style...
