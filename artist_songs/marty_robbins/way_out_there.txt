[Yodel]

A lonely spot I know where no man may go
Where the shadows have all of the room
I was ridin' free on that old S. P.
Hummin' a southern tune
When a man came along, made me hush my song
Kicked me off away out there

[Yodel]

As she went passin' by I caught her on the fly
And I climbed in an open door
Then I turned around to that desert ground
I would see no more
And as I rode away I heard the pale moon say
Sure gets lonesome way out there

[Yodel]
