(Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay!)
(Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay!)

South of the border, down Mexico way,
That's where I fell in love
When stars above came out to play,
And now as they wander, my thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way.

And she sighed as she whispered "manana,"
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as I whispered "manana,"
For our tomorrow never came.

South of the border, I rode back one day.
There in a veil of white by candlelight,
She knelt to pray.
The mission bells told me that I mustn't stay
South of the border, down Mexico way.

Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay!
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay!
