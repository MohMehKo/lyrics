Night time on the desert
A blanket of blue above
Night time on the desert
Time to dream of love

The light that I'm under is a moon big and pale
Somewhere out yonder, a coyote wails
Night time on the desert
Time to dream of love

The light that I'm under is a moon big and pale
Somewhere out yonder, a coyote wails
Night time on the desert
Time to dream of love
