Chapel bells, chapel bells

Chapel bells, a message of love you tell
Chapel bells ring sweetly tonight
All is well, echo the chapel bells
Neath the spell of the moon's golden light

In my arms I hold you so close to me
And love flows so tenderly
From your heart to mine
And as we whisper softly our words of love
Are echoing far above
As chapel bells chime

Chapel bells, a message of love you tell
Chapel bells ring sweetly tonight
All is well, echo the chapel bells
Neath the spell of the moon's golden light

In my arms I hold you so close to me
And love flows so tenderly
From your heart to mine
And as we whisper softly our words of love
Are echoing far above
As chapel bells chime
