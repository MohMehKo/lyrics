It's a long, long ride from Phoneix to Chicago
Quite a ride from Rome to Singapore
It's a long, long ride from lover's lane to cheatin'
Baby, that's the ride you took me for
It's a long, long ride from Maine to Dallas, Texas
Dallas, Texas back to Swannee shore
But the ride that's longest yet, is the one I can't forget
'Cause, baby, that's the one you took me for

It's a long, long ride from Portland to Atlanta
At least three thousand miles or maybe more
It's a long, long, long ride from happiness to pride
Baby, that's the ride you took me for
It's a long, long ride from promises to lyin'
And I ain't gonna' take it anymore
But the day you made me fall was the longest ride of all
'Cause, baby, that's the one you took me for
