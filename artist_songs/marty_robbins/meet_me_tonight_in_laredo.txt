She met him one night in Laredo just a wild comanchero they say
They told her that he'd been an outlaw and she'd have to send him away
They warned her of toil and of hardships and a life filled with heartaches and tears
Then one day he sent her a message the one she'd been waiting to hear
Meet me tonight in Laredo wait till the moon's hanging low
Meet me tonight in Laredo we'll soon be in old Mexico

The night as they slipped through the darkness
To the trail where their horses were tied
He whispered a prayer for tomorrow that she would be safe by his side
She smiled as they climbed in the saddle and as swift as a wild prairie wind
They rode to the Madre Sierra repeating these words once again
Meet me tonight in Laredo wait till the moon's hanging low
Meet me tonight in Laredo we'll soon be in old Mexico.

Now in their own hacienda in the glow of a soft candle light
The hands that once held a sixgun are holding their baby tonight
She echoes his God will go with us and at night when the moon's hanging low
She smiles as she fondly remembers the words he had said long ago
Meet me tonight in Laredo wait till the moon's hanging low
Meet me tonight in Laredo we'll soon be in old Mexico
