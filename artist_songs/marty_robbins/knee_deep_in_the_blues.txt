Well I've just been thinking things over my heart has flowen with tears
My life just don't seem worth living and it's been this way for years
My skies have all turned to grey now and I just walk the soles off of my shoes
Well I don't have much to say now well I'm just knee deep in the blues

Well I've just been thinking things over my heart has flowen with tears
My life just don't seem worth living and it's been this way for years
Don't ask me why I am crying cause I have lost about all I can lose
Well there's just no use in trying well I'm just knee deep in the blues
