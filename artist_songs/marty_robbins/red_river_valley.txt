From this valley they say you are leaving
We shall miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
For you take with you all of the sunshine
That has brightened our pathway a while

Then come sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
Just remember the Red River Valley
And the cowboy that's loved you so true

For a long time, my darlin', I've waited
For the sweet words you never would say
Now, alas, must my fond hopes all vanish,
For they say that you're going away

Then come sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
Just remember the Red River Valley
And the cowboy that's loved you so true

Do you think of the valley you're leaving,
Oh how lonely and drear it will be,
Do you think of he kind hearts you're breaking,
And the pain you are causing to me.

Come and sit by my side if you love me, 
Do not hasten to bid me adieu, 
Just remember the Red River Valley, 
And the cowboy who loved you so true
