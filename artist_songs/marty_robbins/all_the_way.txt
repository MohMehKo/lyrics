If somebody loves you it's no good unless he loves you all the way
Happy to be near you when you need someone to cheer you all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is that's how it's gotta be
Deeper than the deep blue sea is that's how it goes when it's real

When somebody needs you it's no good unless he needs you all the way
Through the good or lean years and through all the end between years come what may

Who knows where the road may take us only a fool could say
But if you let me love you it's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way all the way

Who knows where the road may take us only a fool could say
But if you let me love you it's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way all the way
