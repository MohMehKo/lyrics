I was doin' fine till you showed up this mornin'
And I got that feelin' that I thought was gone
You were just too much to take without a warnin'
Oh, I feel another heartbreak comin' on

I had taught myself to get along without you
It took weeks to make things right, that you made wrong
And, just like that, you shattered all I worked for
Oh, I feel another heartbreak comin' on

Didn't have enough time to get over
Just from dawn till dark and dark till dawn
I was doin' fine till you showed up this mornin'
Oh, I feel another heartbreak comin' on

Didn't have enough time to get over
Just from dawn till dark and dark till dawn
I was doin' fine till you showed up this mornin'
Oh, I feel another heartbreak comin' on
