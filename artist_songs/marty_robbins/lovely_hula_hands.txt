Lovely hula hands
Graceful as the birds in motion
Gliding like the gulls over the ocean
Lovely hula hands, kou lima nani e.

Lovely hula hands
Telling of the rains in the valley
And the swirling winds over the pali
Lovely hula hands, kou lima nani e.

I can feel your soft caresses of your hula hand
Your lovely hula hands
Every little move expresses so I'll understand
All the tender meaning.

Of your hula hands
Fingertips that say aloha
Say to me again I love you
Lovely hula hands, kou lima nani e...
