Many tears ago you said you loved me
Oh, how happy was this heart of mine
Then a dark cloud came from out of nowhere
And the sun went down, no more to shine

Many tears ago, I've learned too well, love
What it means to bear a heavy load
I found out just what is meant by sorrow
Many tears ago along life's road

Many tears ago I built a castle
I built it very strong and very tall
Though I thought it had a firm foundation
Many tears ago I saw it fall

Many tears ago, was in the springtime
When you said goodbye and went away
Oh, how well this achin' heart remembers
Many, many tears ago today
