Sing me somethin' sentimental
Make it anything that's blue
Sing it sweet and sing it tender
Just the way she used to do
If I cry pay no attention
Every tear that falls is real
Sing me somethin' sentimental
'Cause that's the way I feel

Sing it for somebody special
That's just what she was to me
Where we used to sit together
Now I sit alone, you see
Seems like yeaserday she loved me
But I guess it wasn't real
Sing me somethin' sentimental
'Cause that's the way I feel

Sing me somethin' sentimental
Just as if your heart will break
Since she's gone my heart has taken
More than any heart should take
If you see her say, I love her
She's the one I'll always miss
Sing me somethin' sweet and tender
Make every word a kiss

She was lovelier than ever
On the day she was his bride
As I stood and watched him kiss her
I fell all apart inside
Now I realize I've lost her
Oh, it all seems so unreal
Sing me somethin' sentimental
'Cause that's the way I feel
