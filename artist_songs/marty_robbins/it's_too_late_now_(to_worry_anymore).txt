Things have changed a lot since first we met
Still recall the gingham dress you wore
The lovely night I'm tryin' to forget
Too late now to worry anymore.

Those simple vows we made were not to be
You'll never love me as you did before
Your tender smile no longer is for me
Too late now to worry anymore.

Tears that dim my eyes have passed away
Left me only memories of yore
You've gone and there is nothin' left to say
Too late now to worry anymore.

Wherever you may wander may you find
The kind of love your heart is searchin' for
Forget about this aching heart of mine
Too late now to worry anymore...
