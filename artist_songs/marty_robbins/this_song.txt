If you're among those with a sad lonely heart
You're just getting over a world torn apart
If the only one you wanted says she doesn't want you
This song's especially for you

This song has meaning for those who've loved and lost
This song is special to the ones love's doubled crossed
So if you're among the many who've been dropped for someone new
This song's especially for you

This song was written for those who wanna die
It has a line with a place left to cry
So if you've known just heartaches, they're still hurtin' clear through
This song's especially for you

This song has meaning for those who've loved and lost
This song is special to the ones love's doubled crossed
So if you're among the many who've been dropped for someone new
This song's especially for you
