I'll step aside for you if you don't want me
I'll step aside for you if you don't care
I'm not the one to cling to a broken promise
I'll step aside for someone else somewhere

I'll step aside for you if you don't want me
I'll step aside for you and you alone
And when I'm gone just promise you'll remember
That I was once your darlin', all your own

Before you go just answer this one question
As you gaze into my tear dimmed eyes
Can it be true, you never cared about me
And all those words I treasured were just lies

I'll step aside for you if you don't want me
I'll step aside for you and you alone
And when I'm gone just promise you'll remember
That I was once your darlin', all your own
