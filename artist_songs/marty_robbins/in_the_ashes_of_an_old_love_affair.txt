In the ashes of an old love I found the spark burning yet
As I watched it I kept thinking I could never forget
An old love that didn't last I saw my future just like my past
In the ashes of an old love affair
Then a spark rosin gave light to a world of romance
And it thrilled me to think there could still be a chance
In these mouldering embers I saw love burning bright
In the ashes of an old love affair

Then a spark rosin gave light to a world of romance
And it thrilled me to think there could still be a chance
In these mouldering embers I saw love burning bright
In the ashes of an old love affair
