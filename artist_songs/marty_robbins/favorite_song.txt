Like a song you keep returning, you never leave to stay
You're mean to me, why must you be, why don't you stay away
Every goodbye kiss keeps sayin' to love like this is wrong
You'll come back to me in memory like a favourite song

When I think that I've forgotten someone calls your name
I find an old love letter and the flame burns bright again
So until you make your mind up to stay where you belong
You'll come back to me in memory like a favourite song

When I think that I've forgotten someone calls your name
I find an old love letter and the flame burns bright again
Until you make your mind up to stay where you belong
You'll come back to me in memory like a favourite song
You'll come back to me in memory like a favourite song
