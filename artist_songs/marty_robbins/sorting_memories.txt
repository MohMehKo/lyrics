If you've ever spent a night, your mind in torture
With your thoughts so disarranged you couldn't sleep
Then you wish that you could sort out all your memories
And set aside just the ones you wanna keep

I have learned how to sort out my memories
And the ones that hurt I've learned to push aside
And with tears I've built a wall of just the sad ones
There the ones of you I've hidden deep inside

If you've spent one night like this, well, then you're lucky
'Cause I've spent a million thinkin' of the things we've done
And I've learned how to cry and go on livin'
And to sort out my memories one by one

I have learned how to sort out my memories
And the ones that hurt I've learned to push aside
And with tears I've built a wall of just the sad ones
There the ones of you I've hidden deep inside
