Rich man, rich man got all the good land
Ain't nothin' left but bad land for the poor man
Rich man's money, rich man's school
Did they make the poor man, rich man's fool

Rich man, rich man never have dirty hands
Never hold a plow that's turnin' his land
Poor man holds it day by day
Did they make the poor man, rich man's slave

I work the field come rain or shine
What else can I do
I have nothing nor has mine
Are we rich man's fools

Poor man, poor man always be a poor man
Sit at the end of day then I'm a tired man
Rich man's money, rich man's school
Did they make the poor man, rich man's fool

Rich man worried 'bout all the money spent
Worried 'bout taxes, he owes the government
Then on payday poor man shines
They can't tax just one thin dime

God loves both of us rich and poor alike
Loves us both the same, equal within his sight
Has no favourites, this I know
For the good book tells me so

Wealth can't buy a home on high
Not all the worldly gold
Faith, on bended knees, can buy
A home in saviour's soul

Rich and poor the same, no good without the flame
I mean the flame of love, sent down from God above
If our Faith in Him we lose
Rich or poor, we're both a fool
