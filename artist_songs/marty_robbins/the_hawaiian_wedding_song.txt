This is the moment, I've waited for
I can hear my heart singing,
Soon bells will be ringing
For this is the moment, of sweet Aloha.

I will love you longer than forever, 
Promise me that you will leave me never.
Here and now dear,
All my love I vow dear.

I will love you longer than forever,
Promise me that you will leave me never.
Now that we are one,
Clouds won't hide the sun.

Blue skies of Hawaii smiles on this our wedding day
On this our wedding day...
