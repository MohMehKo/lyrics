She's on the phone again
Wants to come home again
Wants to try one more time
To prove she's really mine
She wants to try again
I know she'll lie again
To take her back is wrong
But I've been lonely too long

The chance is very slim
That she's forgotten him
She may be tryin' to hide
The hurt, the wounded pride
There's just a chance that she
Might reconsider me
But chances are I'm wrong
But I've been lonely too long

Lonely too long, too long
Walked on like dirt
Lonely too long, too long
And oh, how it hurts
She knows that I'll give in
I'll take her back again
And once more I'll be wrong
But I've been lonely too long
