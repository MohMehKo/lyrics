You gotta climb to scale the mountain
You gotta climb to reach the top
You gotta climb to see the splendor
You gotta climb climb climb don't you stop

Well the path is steep it leads upward the way is rough narrow too
But every step brings you higher until that mountain people come in view

You gotta climb to scale the mountain
You gotta climb to reach the top
You gotta climb to see the splendor
You gotta climb climb climb don't you stop

Don't you give up cause you're weary you can't expect an easy way
Downward path leads to nowhere you gotta climb climb climb everyday

You gotta climb to scale the mountain
You gotta climb to reach the top
You gotta climb to see the splendor
You gotta climb climb climb don't you stop

When you're right on top of your mountain you'll be glad that's struggled on
A few of all you got around you the struggle of the climb all gone

You gotta climb to scale the mountain
You gotta climb to reach the top
You gotta climb to see the splendor
You gotta climb climb climb don't you stop
