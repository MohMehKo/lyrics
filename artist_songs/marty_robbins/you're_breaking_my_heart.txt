You're breakin' my heart while you're holding my hand
You're crushin' the life from my soul
My castles have tumbled, you've shattered my dreams
Now you're breakin' a heart made of gold

You don't have to tell me that our love's at an end
You're tryin' to tell me goodbye while you cry
You're takin' a love and you know it can't mend
You're leavin' a love that won't die
I'm tellin' myself that you'll be back again
But your lips tell me this is a lie

There's no way to measure the price I will pay
For the few months of Heaven I've known
My sunshine will go leavin' darkness, I know
I'll be left in this world all alone

The roses that bloom on the hill never will
The birds that would sing on the hill never will
You're breakin' my heart while you're holding my hand
You're crushin' the life from my soul
My castles have tumbled, you've shattered my dreams
Now you're breakin' a heart made of gold
