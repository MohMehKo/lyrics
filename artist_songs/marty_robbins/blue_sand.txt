Blue sand, you left my island
Now I hold in my hand
This blue, blue sand

Blue sea, that took you from me
We sigh and we're lonely
The sea and me

Will you remember
Our moonlight swims at sea
We laughed together
You gave your love to me

And now there'll be blue days
I'll wear a blue lei
Till we meet again someday
On blue, blue sand

Will you remember
Our moonlight swims at sea
We laughed together
You gave your love to me

And now there'll be blue days
I'll wear a blue lei
Till we meet again someday
On blue, blue sand
