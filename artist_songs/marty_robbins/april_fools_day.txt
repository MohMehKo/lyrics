It should be April Fools Day cause you've been foolin' me
All the things you promised just weren't meant to be
You lied, you lied you cheated, you never could be true
It should be April Fools Day and the joke should be on you

It hurt me so to see you go you're secret love and you
As in the past, for now, at last I found someone new
Your secret love has left you and I found someone new
It should be April Fools Day and the joke should be on you

It should be April Fools Day cause you've been foolin' me
All the things you promised just weren't meant to be
You lied, you lied, you cheated, you never could be true
It should be April Fools Day and the joke should be on you

It hurt me so to see you go you're secret love and you
As in the past, for now, at last I found someone new
Your secret love has left you and I found someone new
It should be April Fools Day and the joke should be on you
