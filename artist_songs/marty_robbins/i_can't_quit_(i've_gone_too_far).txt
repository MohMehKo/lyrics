I'd like to find somebody
Who would be just halfway true
But I can't quit, I've gone too far
I'm deep in love with you
I'd like to pull up stakes and leave
That's what I'd like to do
But I can't quit, I've gone too far
I'm deep in love with you

If I knew then what I know now
I wouldn't be so blue
I'd-a quit seein' you long ago
I wouldn't be lovin' you
Well, you keep so mixed up inside
By things you say and do
But I can't quit, I've gone too far
I'm deep in love with you

I can't quit, I've gone too far
I'm deep in love, you see
You really know your way around
You're makin' it tough on me
Well, a truckload full of dynamite
Couldn't blast you out-a my heart
Are you there to stay, well, it's a-lookin' that way
Why don't you do your part

If I'd-a been smart I'd-a closed my heart
I wouldn't-a let you in
But I find I was wrong when I waited so long
I got you under my skin
Well, you keep so mixed up inside
By things you say and do
But I can't quit, I've gone too far
I'm deep in love with you

If I knew then what I know now
I wouldn't be so blue
I'd-a quit seein' you long ago
I wouldn't be lovin' you
Well, you keep so mixed up inside
By things you say and do
But I can't quit, I've gone too far
I'm deep in love with you
