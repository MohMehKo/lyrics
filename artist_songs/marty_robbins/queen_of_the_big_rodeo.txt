Gather 'round cowboys I'll tell you a tale
A story that's hard to be told
Of a trick ridin' cowgril we loved and we called
The queen of the big rodeo

Wherever she went she was always acclaimed
As the greatest of trick ridin' girls
Perfection and beauty were her's all alone
She was stricly the best in the world

Cowboys and cowgirls remarked of her charm
And a smile that brightened the world
Admired and chosen by many a man
As the best of the trick ridin' girls

One night in Houston the crowd was so big
There was forty-five thousand or more
She had just about finished her act for the night
One more trick the crowd waited for

A dangerous trick at the horse's full speed
A trick that had never been tried
Cowboys and cowgirls both knew if she failed
If she fell she could easily die

The ride was perfection and almost complete
Suddenly somethin' went wrong
The sinch gave away and she lost control
And at full speed she fell to the ground

Not one muscle moved as she lay where she fell
She's unconscious, one bronc buster said
But the doctor removed any doubt from our minds
When he said, the young cowgirl was dead

Not one livin' soul in the crowd made a move
They all knew that somethin' was wrong
As they took her away from the place where she lay
They knew the young cowgirl was gone

Cowboys just stood there with hats in their hands
Their heads were bowed ever so low
Not one eye was dry as we whispered, goodbye
To the queen of the big rodeo
