I get up every mornin' and start my daily routine
Sweep away old memories, brush away old broken dreams
Oh, I must carry on 'cause what's left of my future's at stake
I'm not doin' too well workin' my way through a heartache

I'm workin' my way, workin' my way through a heartache
Tryin' and cryin' it's almost more than I can take
But I know if I fail then I'm gone so I've gotta hang on
I'm not doin' too well workin' my way through a heartache

It's do or die in spite of the pain if I wanna be free
I can't let up 'cause my heart's dependin' on me
I can't for the life of me see where I've made my mistake
I'm not doin' too well workin' my way through a heartache

I'm workin' my way, workin' my way through a heartache
Tryin' and cryin' it's almost more than I can take
But I know if I fail then I'm gone so I've gotta hang on
I'm not doin' too well workin' my way through a heartache
