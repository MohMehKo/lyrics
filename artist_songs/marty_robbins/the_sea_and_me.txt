The sea and me kees lonely company
The tides have come and gone just like your love for me
The tradewinds say that you'll come back someday
I think there's solitude they held take you away

Gone are the moments on dark sandy beaches
Where we get our secret randezvous
The brakers play on coral sands that say
We'll bring her home again the wind the sea and me

Gone are the moments on dark sandy beaches
Where we get our secret randezvous
