Almost persuaded now to believe
Almost persuaded Christ to receive
Seems now some soul to say, "go spirit go Thy way
Some more convenient day, on Thee I'll call"

Almost persuaded harvest is past
Almost persuaded doom comes at last
Almost cannot avail almost is but to fail
Sad sad the bitter wail almost, but lost
