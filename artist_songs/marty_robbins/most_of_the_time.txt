Most of the time while I'm here cryin'
I think of how nice it would be
If we two could be back, dear, again together
And forget the troubles that have set us free

I think of doin' things but I'd be sorry
I'm tryin' to find somebody new
I think of lots of things to ease my sorrow
But most of the time I think of you

Most of the time I can't help wondering
It may be you're out with someone new
You wouldn't, if you knew how much it hurt me
When I think that someone else is holdin' you

Most of the time I'm so lonely
The rest of the time I'm so blue
Part of my time I spend in slumber
But most of the time I think of you
