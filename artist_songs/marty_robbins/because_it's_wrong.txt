Here we are we're close together
And it's where we both belong
Two in love like we should never
Be apart, because it's wrong

May the flame of love burn brightly
May it burn forever strong
May we always be together
Not apart, because it's wrong

True romance will have some problems
And to win love must be strong
We should never doubt each other
Or lose faith, because it's wrong

May the flame of love burn brightly
May it burn forever strong
May we always be together
Not apart, because it's wrong
