You were there in my arms, alone in the moonlight
The trees played the waltz of the wind
It was there that I knew I'd love you forever
As we danced to the waltz of the wind.

The stars up above you, looked down in your eyes
And told me the night would never end
Now I'm dreaming of you, till we meet tomorrow
And dance to the Waltz of the wind.

The stars up above you, looked down in your eyes
And told me the night would never end
Now I'm dreaming of you, till we meet tomorrow
And dance to the Waltz of the wind.
