One too many times you left me lonely
Our love to you was take and never give
You destroyed the world that I had built around you
And left me without a world in which to live

Would you take me back again
If I had done these things to you
If I'd made you live through only half
Of what you put me through
If within your heart you knew I'd do
The same things once again
Tell me, darlin, would you take me back again

To you my feelin's never really mattered
Everything was your way or no way at all
You never cared if all my dreams were shattered
Instead of helping me to stand you let me fall

Would you take me back again
If I had done these things to you
If I'd made you live through only half
Of what you put me through
If within your heart you knew I'd do
The same things once again
Tell me, darlin, would you take me back again
Tell me, darlin, would you take me back again
