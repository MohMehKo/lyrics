I passed you on the street today
And as your eyes met mine
I saw somethin' and it took me by surprise
For the first time in a long time
I didn't break and cry
'Cause today I finally saw me in your eyes

I've kept from goin' crazy
With this little thread of hope
Old memories have helped me to survive
In every prayer I prayed is
Help to make things come out right
'Cause today I finally saw me in your eyes

A long, long time ago
You asked me just how long I'd wait
Until Hell freezes over, I replied
The fire of love lunged through me
And I trembled like a child
'Cause today I finally saw me in your eyes

I've made believe so many times
That someone else was you
It didn't work no matter how I tried
'Cause no matter what my lips would say
My heart knew my lips lied
And today I finally saw me in your eyes

A long, long time ago
You asked me just how long I'd wait
Until Hell freezes over, I replied
The fire of love lunged through me
And I trembled like a child
'Cause today I finally saw me in your eyes
Yes, today I finally saw me in your eyes
