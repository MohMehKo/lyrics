Why did you have to care about me
And make your plans for just we two
Well, my heart's now pledged to another
How can I ever have just you

This is the way of a hopeless love
Hopeless, dear, for you and me
I cannot hurt the one I'm pledged to
That's why I never can be free

I pledged my life before I met you
Before you made me love you so
I cannot break vows that are sacred
Although it hurts to let you go

This is the way of a hopeless love
Hopeless, dear, for you and me
I cannot hurt the one I'm pledged to
That's why I never can be free

You must try, dear, to forget me
I must forget you too, it seems
But in years to come should we remember
Let rememberance be just pleasant dreams

This is the way of a hopeless love
Hopeless, dear, for you and me
I cannot hurt the one I'm pledged to
That's why I never can be free
