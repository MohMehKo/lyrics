How green are the valleys
How tall are the trees
How cool are the rivers
How soft is the breeze
If it's just like my dreams
Then I must go and see
For the red hills of Utah are callin' me

So long I have waited
Since I was a child
Merely the thought keeps
My heart runnin' wild
I've waited so long
Now it's hard to believe
The red hills of Utah at last I will see

How pretty are flowers
That bloom in the spring
How sweet are the songs
The mockin'birds sing
If it's just like my dreams
Then I must go and see
For the red hills of Utah are callin' me
