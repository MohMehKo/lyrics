There's a lamp shining bright in a cabin
In a window it's shinin' for me
And I know that my mother is prayin'
For the boy she is longing to see

When it's lamplighting time I can see her
As she rocks in her chair to and fro
But I know that I'll never more see her
'Cause she's gone to a good place I know

Oh, see lights up her lamp and sits waiting
For she knows not the crime that I've done
But I'll change all my ways and I'll meet her
Up in Heaven when life's race is run

When it's lamplighting time in the valley
And in dreams I go back to my home
I can see that old lamp in the window
It will guide me where ever I roam
