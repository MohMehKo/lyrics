Within my prison cell so dreary
I sit alone with achin' heart
I'm dreamin' of my little darlin'
From her forever, I must part

The rose she sent me as a token
She sent it just to lighten my gloom
And tell me that her heart was broken
And cheer me before I meet my doom

The judge would not believe my story
The jury said I had to pay
And with the rose in all its glory
"Not guilty" was all that I could say

Goodbye, sweetheart, for in the morning
To meet my Maker I must go
And when I die at daylight's dawnin'
Against my heart they'll find this rose

Within my prison cell so dreary
I sit alone with achin' heart
I'm dreamin' of my little darlin'
From her forever, I must part
