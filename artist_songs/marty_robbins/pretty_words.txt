Too late to be sorry, too late to forget
I don't know what's happened to me
I know that I'm lonely, I know that I'm left
Pretty words make a fool out of me

Pretty words, pretty words you spoke such pretty words
You spoke pretty words warm and sweet
Now you've gone, here am I, wanna smile but I cry
Pretty words made a fool out of me

Love that's strong for a day like a flower fades away
Then I think of the things that could be
I don't want to forget I'm not sorry I left
Pretty words make a fool out of me

Pretty words, pretty words, how I love those pretty words
Pretty words were like Heaven to me
It's as plain as can be, it's so easy to see
Pretty words made a fool out of me
