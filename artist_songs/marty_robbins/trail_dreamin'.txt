All through the day in the saddle I sway
Visions glow as I go trail deramin'
I see a home on a blue mountain dome
Lovingly that I made, trail dreamin'

There's a rainbow trail that's lined with stars
That leads to a gate with moonbeam bars
And it's welcome, I feel, till my visons so real
Turn to dust 'cause I'm just trail dreamin
