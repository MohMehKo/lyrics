All the islands are sad cause you're leavin' me
The Lord only knows just how lonesome I'll be
The days, the nights we shared were so much fun
My darlin', my wonderful one

My wonderful one, my wonderful one
You're sailing out to the sea
My wonderful one, my wonderful one
Oh hurry home, please hurry home to me

My wonderful one, my wonderful one
You're sailing out to the sea
My wonderful one, my wonderful one
Oh hurry home, please hurry home to me
