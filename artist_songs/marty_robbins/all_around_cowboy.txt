Well, all around cowboy, I've won it six years in a row
All around cowboy means champ of the big rodeo
I made me some money, I had me some good times
The falls that I've had been few
Till a rodeo queen made the all around cowboy
Look like an all around fool

I was the cowboy that said he would never be rode
I even bragged how I'd never be branded or broke
I was doin' right well till this blonde, little filly
Rode into my life like a dream
And the all around cowboy fell head over heels
In love with the rodeo queen

The moment I looked in her blue eyes I knew I was gone
I tried to hide them, but the feelin's I had were too strong
She showed the world what an all around cowboy could do
She showed the world how an all around cowboy
Could look like an all around fool

She made me feel like a horse without any fire
Too late I realized, breakin' me was her desire
She rolled me and raked me with spurs that left such a hurt
She left me broken and she left me cryin'
Out there in the rodeo dirt

The moment I looked in her blue eyes I knew I was gone
I tried to hide them, but the feelin's I had were too strong
She showed the world what an all around cowboy could do
She showed the world how an all around cowboy
Could look like an all around fool
She showed the world how an all around cowboy
Could look like an all around fool
