Oh my love my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love
I need your love
God-speed your love
To me.

Lonely rivers flow to the arms of the sea
To the waiting arms of the sea
Lonely rivers cry wait for me wait for me
I'll be coming home wait for me

My love, wait for me
Wait for me
Wait for me
(Wait for me)
