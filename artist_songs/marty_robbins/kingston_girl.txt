Just another night and day
Then I'll see Kingston Bay
And when I see Kingston Bay
I'll see my Kingston woman
I'll see my Kingston girl

I work on boat that sails the sea
Kingston woman waits for me
Waits for me to see the world
I want my Kingston woman
I want my Kingston girl

I wish I never leave my home
Kingston Town where I belong
Kingston girl who loves me so
The one I hurt when I go
This was a long, long time ago

Soon we walk on golden sand
Kingston woman hold my hand
When the moon is shining bright
I'll kiss my Kingston woman
I'll kiss my Kingston girl

Just another night and day
Then I'll see Kingston Bay
And when I see Kingston Bay
I'll see my Kingston woman
I'll see my Kingston girl
