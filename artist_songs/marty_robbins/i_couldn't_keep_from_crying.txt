I saw you walking by his side 
Heard you whisper all those lies 
And I couldn't keep from crying 
You sang him love songs tenderly 
Just the way you sang to me 
And I couldn't keep from crying 

Saw you capture all his charms 
As you nestled in his arms 
With his pretty words and ways 
In your heart he took my place 

I stood and watched him steal a kiss 
From two lips I know I'll miss 
And I couldn't keep from crying.
