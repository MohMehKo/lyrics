In the valley of the Rio Grande is a brown eyed Mexican maiden I want to see
In the valley of the Rio Grande in a garden of roses she said she'd wait for me
To the valley of the Rio Grande I know I must go cause my heart tells me go again
If I stay any longer she may find another to love her
So tonight I must ride for the valley of the Rio Grande
I can see the candle in her window every night she said would brightly burn
I've been travelin' anywhere the wind blows but my heart tells me I must return
To the valley of the Rio Grande
As I ride I will pray that she waits there each day for me
Have I been gone too long will she still be there where I left her
In the garden that lies in the valley of the Rio Grande
