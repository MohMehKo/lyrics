When the roll is called up yonder when the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there

When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time will be no more
And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair
When the saved word shall gather over on the other shore
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there

When the roll is called up yonder...

Let us lay before the Master from the dawn till setting sun
Let us talk of all his wonderous love and care
And when all of life is over and our work on earth is done
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there

When the roll is called up yonder...
