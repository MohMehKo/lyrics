You love him I know but I won't let you go
I just won't step out of the way
'Cause you're married to me and I won't set you free
Posession is nine-tenths of the law so they say

I'll keep you as long as I possibly can
You were mine before he came our way
I refuse to abide and I won't step aside
Posession is nine-tenths of the law so they say

Forgive me for bein' so selfish
But for me there is no other way
I just want to hold on to what's rightfully mine
Posession is nine-tenths of the law so they say

Forgive me for bein' so selfish
But for me there is no other way
I just want to hold on to what's rightfully mine
Posession is nine-tenths of the law so they say
