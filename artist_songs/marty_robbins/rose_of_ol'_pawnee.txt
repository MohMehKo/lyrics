My rose of ol' Pawnee a flower of a dawn
Blooming tenderly her memory still lingers on
My angel of the night a moonlit reverie
A star of love so bright shines on my rose of ol' Pawnee

Sweet are the dreams that I hold in my heart as I go wanderin' along
Long are the hours since we drifted apart deep in my heart is a song
My angel of the night...

Sweet are the dreams...
