Do me a favor let me forget I don't want to remember that we ever met
Please stay away from me leave me alone
I've had too many heartaches a little too long
Each time you walk by I don't know why but I wanna cry
And it's always the same when I hear your name there's a hurt inside
Do me a favor turn my picture to the wall
Then just one last favor forget me once and for all

Each time you walk by I don't know why but I wanna cry
And it's always the same when I hear your name there's a hurt inside
Do me a favor turn my picture to the wall
Then just one last favor forget me once and for all
