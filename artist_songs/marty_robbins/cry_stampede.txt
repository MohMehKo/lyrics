The night was a-blaze with the heavenly fire
Of lightnin', wind, and rain.
And the sound of thunder is spookin' the herd
And I fear there'll be a stampede.
The cattle are starting to mill around,
Their bellows strike fear in my heart.
I know if the storm lasts very much longer,
There's bound to be a stampede.

"Stampede!" ([echo:] "stampede!")
Cry "Stampede!" (cry "stampede!")
The thing that a cowboy fears the most
Is "Stampede!"

As I sit in the saddle, the night's wearin' on
And the storm is lingering still.
The lightnin's glare on the restless herd
Makes it seem like a sea's angry swell.
Then, all of a sudden, a bolt of fire
Strikes the tree where my pony stands.
As I fall to the ground, I can hear the sound
Of a drover yellin' "Stampede!"

"Stampede!" ([echo:] "stampede!")
Cry "Stampede!" (cry "stampede!")
The thing that a cowboy fears the most
Is "Stampede!"

For a moment I lay in the mud half dazed.
I could hear the herd bearin' down.
And I crawled in a ditch where a tree came to rest
And I crouched between it and the ground.
It seems like a miracle of God's hand.
It's over and I'm still alive
And I thank the "Trail Boss" up in the sky
For sparin' me from the stampede.

"Stampede!" ([echo:] "stampede!")
Cry "Stampede!" (cry "stampede!")
The thing that a cowboy fears the most
Is "Stampede!"
