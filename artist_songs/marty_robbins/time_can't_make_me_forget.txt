Time may heal the pain in my heart
But time can't make me forget
Time may hide the tears in my eyes
But time can't make me forget

The way you smiled and laughed with me
The way you'd speak so tenderly
And wedding bells, I hear them yet
No, time cannot make me forget

The way you smiled and laughed with me
The way you'd speak so tenderly
And wedding bells, I hear them yet
No, time cannot make me forget
