When I met you I knew I couldn't keep you
And nothin' I could do would make you stay
But, my darlin', I'm not bitter
Over things that just can't be
For with you I lived a lifetime in a day

I'll remember every tender word you spoke, dear
Each tender touch, each time you looked my way
And the secrets that we shared will be my secret
For with you I lived a lifetime in a day

I'm not sorry that I knew your kind of love
If I've sinned, then the price I'll gladly pay
To my lonely life you brought the sunshine
For with you I lived a lifetime in a day

I'm not sorry that I knew your kind of love
If I've sinned, then the price I'll gladly pay
To my lonely life you brought the sunshine
For with you I lived a lifetime in a day
