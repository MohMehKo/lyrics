With his hand on my shoulder I sail this sea of sin
With his hand on my shoulder I cannot help but win
I'll follow as he pilots me through waters dark and cold
With His hand on my shoulder I know I'll reach my goal

My every hope is anchored to the faith I have in him
I know I'll reach the shoreline though at times the lights are dim
He'll take me past the rocky cliffs from life's storm I'll be released
With his hand on my shoulder I'll have everlasting peace

Surrounded by an angry sea that's made of hate and sin
But I won't sink as long as I won't let the waters in
And with the help of God I know I'll never lose my way
With his hand on my shoulder I cannot go astray

I have a home up in the sky and he made it just for me
But to prove that I'll desert this home I have to sail this sea
The waves of sin sometimes are high and the spray might touch my clothes
With his hand on my shoulder it will never touch my soul
