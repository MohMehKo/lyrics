Sixteen weeks ago tonight I let you walk away
I threw a kiss and smiled as you walked out the door
But I've done some thinkin', lately, and I find
That it isn't half as funny as before

Sixteen weeks ago tonight I really played a fool
Made a big mistake, but everybody does
Lately, though, I've done some cryin' 'cause I find
That it isn't half as funny as it was

Didn't miss you until I dreamed about some things we used to do
Then I realized how long you'd been away
Don't know how much more of this my heart can take
Wish I'd known the difference sixteen weeks could make

Didn't miss you until I dreamed about some things we used to do
Then I realized how long you'd been away
Don't know how much more of this my heart can take
Wish I'd known the difference sixteen weeks could make
