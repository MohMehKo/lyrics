Oh, the roses haven't bloomed in People's Valley
And the old mill wheel we played on doesn't turn
And the brook still calls your name in People's Valley
But the mockin' birds won't sing till you return

You asked me if I'd wait until I heard from you
A year has passed and still there's not one word from you
Ya told me when the grass was green you'd come to me
I watch the trail and wait for you to ride to me

When you're driftin's done I'll be in People's Valley
In the meadow where the brook still calls your name
