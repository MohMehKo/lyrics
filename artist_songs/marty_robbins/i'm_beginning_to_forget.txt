(I think that I'm beginning to forget)

I think that I'm beginning to forget you
And I should because I've tried with all my might
I think that I'm beginning to forget you (forget you)
Cause I only cried a little bit last night

I think that I'm beginning to forget you
I think, or maybe it just seems that way
I think that I'm beginning to forget you (forget you)
Cause I only read your letters once today

Lately I hardly think about you
Unless I'm by myself or with a friend
I think that I'm beginning to forget you (forget you)
Cause I only kiss your picture now and then
