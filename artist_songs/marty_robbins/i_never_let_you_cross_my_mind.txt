I never let you cross my mind unless I want you to
You're not my worry anymore except when I feel blue
I never think about the time when you were all my own
I never let you cross my mind except when I'm alone

You're just another memory I think about at times
When someone plays the organ and they ring those wedding chimes
I've broken all the ties that bind you're locked outside my heart
I never let you cross my mind except when we're apart

I never let you cross my mind 'cause that would fan the flame
I'm much too busy havin' fun till someone calls your name
I always find a lot to do to make the minutes fly
I never let you cross my mind except when you pass by

You're just another memory I think about at times
When someone plays the organ and they ring those wedding chimes
I'm getting lots of rest at night, at least that's how it seems
I never let you cross my mind except in all my dreams
