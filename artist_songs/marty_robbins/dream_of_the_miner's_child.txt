A miner was leavin' his home for his work
He heard his little child scream
He went to the side of his little girl's bed
Oh, daddy, I've had such a dream

Oh, daddy my daddy, oh don't go away
For dreams have so often come true
Oh, daddy my daddy, oh don't go away
I never could live without you

I dreamed that the mine was all covered with flame
The men all fought for their lives
Just then the scene changed, and the mouth of the mine
Was covered with sweethearts and wives

Oh, daddy my daddy, oh don't go away
For dreams have so often come true
Oh, daddy my daddy, oh don't go away
I never could live without you

Go down to the village and tell your dear friends
As sure as the bright stars do shine
There's somethin' that's goin' to happen today
Oh, daddy, don't go to the mine

Her daddy was smilin' and stroking her hair
Was turning away from her side
But throwin' her small arms around daddy's neck
She gave him a kiss and then cried

Oh, daddy my daddy, oh don't go away
For dreams have so often come true
Oh, daddy my daddy, oh don't go away
I never could live without you
