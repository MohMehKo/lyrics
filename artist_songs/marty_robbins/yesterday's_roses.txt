Roses, pressed in a bible
Bring wonderful memories of you
Roses, withered and faded
The same as the love we once knew

Yesterday's roses covered with teardrops
Yesterday's teardrops sparkle like dew
I'll always treasure yesterday's roses
Tellin' a story that never came true

Sometimes when I'm alone, dear
My poor heart is breaking inside
True love we might have known, dear
But just like the roses, it died

Yesterday's roses covered with teardrops
Yesterday's teardrops sparkle like dew
I'll always treasure yesterday's roses
Tellin' a story that never came true
