Memories come floodin' back through a veil of tears
But I've been almost happy for just the past two years
The word's out that she's come back and the thought makes me tremble
It took two years to forget her and just seconds to remember

Seconds to remember all the things that used to be
Seconds to remember how much she meant to me
Love has burst a flame from a dying ember
It took two years to forget her and just seconds to remember

As I recall the day she left with somebody new
I vowed that I'd forget her any way I could
The minute I heard she was back I felt the same old hunger
It took two years to forget her and just seconds to remember

Seconds to remember all the things that used to be
Seconds to remember how much she meant to me
Love has burst a flame from a dying ember
It took two years to forget her and just seconds to remember
