Don't be nice to me
Just because I'm you used to be
Forget me
You don't owe me a thing

My heart is cryin' now
But it will laugh again, somehow
Forget me
You don't owe me a thing

You lend your heart, you never give
I guess I should have known
These teardrops fallin' from my eyes
Are just interest on the loan

Don't be nice to me
Just because I'm you used to be
Forget me
You don't owe me a thing

You lend your heart, you never give
I guess I should have known
These teardrops fallin' from my eyes
Are just interest on the loan

Don't be nice to me
Just because I'm you used to be
Forget me
You don't owe me a thing
