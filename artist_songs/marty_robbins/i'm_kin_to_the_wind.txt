Wherever the trail may wind wherever the mountains climb
That's where you'll find me I'm kin to the wind
Wherever the trail may go wherever the tumbleweeds grow
That's where you'll find me I'm kin to the wind

Night time may find me at a campfire bright
Long before daylight I'll be gone with the night
Wherever the river winds wherever the mountains climb
That's where you'll find me I'm kin to the wind
