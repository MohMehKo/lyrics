I still have the photograph that you sent me
I'll treasure it until the day I die
My only happiness is your picture
It's all you left the day you said goodbye

You look so sweet just sittin' on the table
No other photograph could take your place
And if it's wrong to love you, my darlin'
Then I sin each time I kiss your paper face

Since the day you walked away with my heart
A million tears have fallen from my eyes
And now it's plain to see that you don't want me
I should forget you, now I realize

But ev'ry time I look at your picture
It brings back memories time can't erase
And if it's wrong to love you, my darlin'
Then I sin each time I kiss your paper face
