When you went away I cried
I was hurt down deep inside
Such misery, just a broken heart can tell
Now  my lonesome tears I've shed
And I've said what should be said
I can get along without you very well

Down before me on your knees
Forgiveness, dear, you plead
You're sorry for the lies you used to tell
Now you want me back again
To forgive would be a sin
I can get along without you very well

You don't seem to realize
All my love for you has died
I don't hate you but I'm sorry that I fell
For your lies and tricks and schemes
You're no longer in my dreams
I can get along without you very well

Now our love is at an end
And your loneliness begins
How much I've loved you there's no way to tell
But it's over now and past
I forgot your love at last
I can get along without you very well
