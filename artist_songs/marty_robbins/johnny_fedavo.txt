Down in the little Mexican town of New Wavo
There lived a maiden lovely as a rose
Deep was the love of Lisa, the rose of New Wavo
For Johnny Fedavo and he loved her too
They made a vow that they'd always love each other
For them, on other could be so true

Storm clouds swept in the life of Johnny Fedavo
The promise of Heaven lasted for just a day
God needed someone to brighten his throne
Lisa was taken and Johnny was left all alone

That day in the little Mexican town of New Wavo
Sadly, a village laid their rose away
Johnny came home but no Lisa was there to meet him
No arms to greet him or hold him tight
Johnny prayed alone for God to hear it
To take his spirit away that night

The years passed by and no one saw Johnny Fedavo
The children grew and people were gay once more
One day they found him with hair snowy white
The rose in his hand was his message to Lisa that night

Down in the little Mexican town of New Wavo
Two lovers at last their peace with God have found
Deep was the love of Lisa, the rose of New Wavo
For Johnny Fedavo and he loved her too
There in the chapel shadows they both lay sleeping
Their vows still keeping and both still true
