Dear Warden wrote a mother, how much longer must I wait
Before you send my boy back home to me
She little knew the angels had unlocked the prison gates
And the one she loved had already been set free

The Warden read the letter and then he sadly cried
As with these words the sorrow he replied
There's little box of pine on the seven twenty nine
Bringing back a lost sheep to the fold
For a pardon from above has returned the one you loved
It is the saddest story ever has been told

For he's takin' his last ride never more this world to roam
On his face there is a smile for he knows he's going home
There's a little box of pine on the seven twenty nine
Bringing back a lost sheep to the fold

The church was filled with music as the service did begin
His broken hearted folks were gathered there
The preacher told the story of a  boy who'd gone astray
The heavy load his loved ones had to pay.

When he had breathed his sermon the organ softly played
And on their knees the congregation prayed
There's a little box of pine on the seven twenty nine
Bringing back a lost sheep to the fold
For a pardon from above has returned the one you love
It is the saddest story ever has been told.
