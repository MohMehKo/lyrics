Well I been a-ridin' shotgun on the Houston-Dallas stage
I got me a sawed-off hogleg, twenty is the number guage
I'd shoot anybody that would try to stop this ride
A lot of outlaws tried it, a lot of outlaws died

Shotgun rider, Shotgun rider, Shotgun rider, Shotgun rider

I was sheriff down in Austin a long, long time ago
A hangin' judge was a-my best friend and he never let a poor soul go
I left that town for a better job a-ridin' on this stage
Shootin' outlaws with this gun is how I won my fame

Shotgun rider, Shotgun rider, Shotgun rider, Shotgun rider

You can ask anybody north of the Rio Grande
If they don't want no trouble, don't truck with the shotgun man
'Cause I got an itchy finger and I got an eagle's eye
I can spot a desperado with trail dust in my eyes
