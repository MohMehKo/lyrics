The way that we live has no meaning
We drift more apart day by day
It's so plain to see you're not satisfied with me
And it looks like I'm just in your way

You seem to forget you're not perfect
You show me my faults every day
But you took my name knowing I could never change
Now it looks like I'm just in your way

I'm never alone yet I'm lonesome
For love that you've taken away
We're never apart yet I'm second in your heart
And it looks like I'm just in your way

If what you have found makes you happy
Then I see no reason to stay
'Cause there seems to be somethin' you love more than me
And it looks like I'm just in your way
