Don't tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John.
He claims he got married, but he's having lots of fun.
Oh baby, yeah baby,
Ooh, baby, having me some fun tonight.

Well, long, tall Sally, she's built sweet,
She's got everything that Uncle John needs.
Oh baby, yeah baby,
Ooh baby, having me some fun tonight.

Well, I saw Uncle John with bald-head Sally,
He saw Aunt Mary coming and he ducked back in the alley.
Oh baby, yeah baby,
Oh baby, having me some fun tonight.

Well, long, tall Sally, she's built sweet,
She's got everything that Uncle John needs.
Oh baby, yeah baby,
Ooh, baby, having me some fun tonight.

You know, I saw Uncle John with bald-head Sally,
He saw Aunt Mary coming and he ducked back in the alley.
Ooh, baby, having me some fun tonight.

I'm gonna have some fun tonight,
Have some fun tonight, have some fun tonight,
Everything's all right,
Have some fun, having me some fun tonight.
