I'm happy 'cause you're hurtin', dear, and though it makes me blue
I'm happy 'cause the one ya love is not in love with you
I'm happy 'cause he's treatin' you just like a used to be
I'm so happy that you're hurtin' just like me

I'm happy 'cause like me you're always lonesome
You're sentimental, always feelin' blue
Just like me you've lost your one and only
You love him the way that I love you

I'm happy 'cause you're hurtin', dear, and though it breaks my heart
I'm happy that by now I guess you learn you're not so smart
I'm laughin' 'cause you're cryin', dear, and though it shouldn't be
I'm so happy that you're hurtin' just like me

I'm happy 'cause like me you're always lonesome
You're sentimental, always feelin' blue
Just like me you've lost your one and only
You love him the way that I love you

I'm happy 'cause you're hurtin', dear, and though it breaks my heart
I'm happy that by now I guess you learn you're not so smart
I'm laughin' 'cause you're cryin', dear, and though it shouldn't be
I'm so happy that you're hurtin' just like me
