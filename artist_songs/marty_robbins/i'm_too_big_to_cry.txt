I guess I never realized
How lonesome I could be
I never thought the time would come
When you'd grow tired of me
Your voice was never sweeter than
The day you said goodbye
You never know how much I hurt
Cause I'm too big to cry

If I knew then what I know now
You'd still be kissin' me
Instead there's someone elses lips
Where my two lips should be
I say, hello, and wish you well
Each time as you walk by
You never know how much I hurt
Cause I'm too big to cry

You never did look lovelier
Than when you walked away
When I can't sleep I don't count sheep
I count mistakes I've made
I can't believe you don't love me
No matter how I try
You never know how much I hurt
Cause I'm too big to cry

It seems so strange to be alone
I never dreamed we'd part
The tears that fall, you'll never see
There fallin' in my heart
To go through life without you're love
I guess I'd rather die
You never know what I go through
Cause I'm too big to cry
