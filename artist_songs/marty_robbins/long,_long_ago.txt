Tell me the tales that to me were so dear
Long, long ago, long, long ago
Sing me the songs I delight in to hear
Long, long ago, long ago

Now you are come all my fears are removed
Let me forget for how long you have grown
Let me believe that you love as you loved
Long, long ago, long ago

Do you remember the past where we met
Long, long ago, long, long ago
Ah yes, you told me you'd never forget
Long, long ago, long ago

Then, to all others, my smile you preferred
Love, when you spoke, gave a charm to each word
Still my heart treasures the praises I heard
Long, long ago, long ago
