Someone's gotta hold you so tight
Someone's gotta kiss you every night
You've got to be loved all the time
'Cause you're everybody's darlin' plus mine

You're everybody's darlin' plus mine
And you walk with one foot across the line
Right words from any fool can change your mind
'Cause you're everybody's darlin' plus mine

Attention is all that you crave
If you were mine, think of heartaches you would save
Contentment and true love you'd never find
'Cause you're everybody's darlin' plus mine

You're everybody's darlin' plus mine
And you walk with one foot across the line
Right words from any fool can change your mind
'Cause you're everybody's darlin' plus mine
