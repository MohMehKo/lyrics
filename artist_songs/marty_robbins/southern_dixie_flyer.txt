At the station house one day
Was a lady old and gray
I could tell her heart was feelin' sad and low
With a teardrop in her eye
she was tryin' not to cry
I determined then her story I would know

I ventured a word
Then a sad, sad tale I heard
Of a mother who had lost her only child
Yes they've taken her away
These words I heard her say
And they're travellin' on that Southern Dixie Flyer

She was only sweet sixteen
And the only joy I've seen
What God has given now he takes away
She'll be taken home again
On that southbound railroad train
To be laid there with her daddy in the grave

I've no money of my own
I can't even take her home
But I want to be there with my heart's desire
But then she could say no more
As the echo drifted o'er
Was the whistle of that Southern Dixie Flyer

As the train pulled out of sight
And the day became as night
Was a scene to bring a tear to any eye
Just a lady all alone
Not a thing to call her own
But some memories from a better day gone by

I knew right away
There was nothin' I could say
To soothe her heart
Or dry those tear dimmed eyes
So I turned to walk away
From the lady old and gray
Whose heart was on that Southern Dixie Flyer

I've no money of my own
I can't even take her home
But I want to be there with my heart's desire
But then she could say no more
As the echo drifted o'er
Was the whistle of that Southern Dixie Flyer
