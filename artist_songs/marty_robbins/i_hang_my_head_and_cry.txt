Everytime I see her passin' by
All I do is hang my head and cry
And I can't forget her though I try
All I do is hang my head and cry

Golden love, oh, golden love you've gone
But each precious moment lingers on
And my weary heart keeps askin' why
All I do is hang my head and cry

Everytime I see her passin' by
All I do is hang my head and cry
And I can't forget her though I try
All I do is hang my head and cry

Foolish pride, oh pride what have you done
You have made me lose the only one
And my weary heart keeps askin' why
All I do is hang my head and cry
