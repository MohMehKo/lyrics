If you smell the smoke
You don't need to be told
What you got to do
Yet there's a certain breed
So very in-between
They'd rather take a vote
Running short on time
Til they can't decide
What we already know
That we are here to go
We are here to go

What is really mine?
Who's at the top of the pile?
Where does he draw the line?
Let them figure it out
Go on and step across
Just remind yourself
That we are here to go

When it grows too long
The day awaits the dawn
The hand that bites gets fed
Troubles multiply
The crowd begins to cry
For some common sense
Let them all dig in
When the odds are no-win
Head for the nearest door
Cause we are here to go

What is really mine?
Who's at the top of the pile?
Where does he draw the line?
Let them figure it out
Go on and step across
Just remind yourself
That we are here to go
