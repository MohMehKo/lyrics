Young hunks
Cyberpunks
And sweet things
Trying hard to change your luck
Baby thugs
Bad spuds
And mean things
Living for today or maybe even yesterday
Look around
Shakey ground
Do the right thing
In this world you're just a guest
Do it now
Time's run out for the pig thing
Living for today stealing from tomorrow
Law and order puppets remote-controlled by greed
And tv preacher robots won't give you what you need
Use your head
Sidestep the traps

Snake through the chaos with a smooth noodle map
Besides the king's been dead
They blew off his head in '63
Big bucks
Energy sucks
And dumb things
Make it hard to live and breathe
Add it up
No matter what
There's one thing
Living for today there's maybe no tomorrow
Subhuman bloodless leaders fed on lies and fear
And tv anchor news teams trim all we see and hear
Use your head
Sidestep the traps
Snake through the chaos with a smooth noodle map
Besides God isn't dead
He's in your head
Right where he ought to be
