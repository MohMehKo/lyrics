We do not like the way you slide 
We do not like the soft inside 
We do not like you many ways 
And we could do without you for days 

Baby-talking bitches 
Looking for a man 
Mama, baby, dada 
Get lost while you can 

We do not like the way you slide 
We do not like the soft inside 
We do not like you many ways 
And we could do without you for days 

Baby-talking bitches 
Down with our fun 
Man was meant for woman 
Why are you so dumb? 

We do not like the way you slide 
We do not like the soft inside 
We do not like you many ways 
And we could do without you for days
