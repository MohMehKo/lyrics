Ice starts meltin' 33 degrees
(A change is gonna cum)
Little girl thinkin' 'bout the birds and bees
(A change is gonna cum)

Man grows up, goes down on his knees
(A change is gonna cum)
Here it comes

Every new beginning is a delicate time
But just like when the end comes it's never very pretty
And every in-between time looks like a perfect picture
It seems to last forever because it's standing still

But, oh baby
(A change is gonna cum)
Not just maybe
(A change is gonna cum)

Ozone layer starts to disappear
(A change is gonna cum)
Spaceman makes it with an alien girl
(A change is gonna cum)

Scientists prove we were never here!
(A change is gonna cum)
Here it comes

But, oh mama
(A change is gonna cum)
Psychodrama
(A change is gonna cum)
