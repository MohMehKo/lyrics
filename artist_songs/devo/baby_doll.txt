Girl of my dreams, she don't love me
Always the way it seems to be
My baby doll, my baby doll
My baby doll, my baby doll
My baby doll

Light of my life, she turns it on
Over my head not close enough
My baby doll, my baby doll
My baby doll, my baby doll
My baby doll

Baby doll, you look so good
Baby doll, you feel so big
Baby doll, you let me have it
Baby doll, why did you do it, baby doll?

Baby doll, baby doll
Baby doll, baby doll

Quick tempered queen knows what she wants
And what I got is what it's not
My baby doll, my baby doll
My baby doll, my baby doll
My baby doll

Baby doll, you look so good
Baby doll, you feel so big
Baby doll, you let me have it
Baby doll, why did you do it, baby doll?

Baby doll, baby doll
Why did you do it, baby doll?
Baby doll, baby doll
Why did you do it, baby doll?

Baby doll, baby doll
Why did you do it, baby doll?
Baby doll, baby doll
Why did you do it, baby doll?
