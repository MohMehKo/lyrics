When I woke up this morning
I wasn't in my bed
You know I had an itchy, itchy feeling
Running round my head

I looked at my watch
And this is what it said
You got them dawghaus blues
Got them in your shoes

Boy you know you're bound to lose
Well, I got up and headed home right away
You know I was wondering
What my baby would say

She said wait
She said wait

Well, you been out all night
Got into a fight
And now you got them dawghaus blues

I said baby, baby, baby
Baby please don't go
I said baby, baby, baby
There's somethin' you should know

Well, that trick you do
It's not so new
Someday them dawghaus blues
Are gonna get to you

Yo Bobby
You know my woman was waitin'
Stick in hand
She beat me good
(Whew)

Now I don't understand
I thought there was freedom
In the here land

I got them dawghaus blues
I got them in my shoes
Man you know I'm gonna lose

I said
I said
