I know I let you tell me what to do
You were confident you knew best
Now things aren't working like you want them to
Your confidence is what I detest

You got me lookin' up high
You got me searchin'  down low
You got me I know you know
You got me jerkin' back 'n' forth

You told me, people like to suffer
You told me that's the way it is
You said that things were getting better
You said I should accept all this

You think it's funny
But what I say is true
The reason that I live like this
Is all because of you

You got me lookin' up high
You got me searchin'  down low
You got me I know you know
You got me jerkin' back 'n' forth

There is a thought that keeps me thinking
Like a stone inside my shoe
It is a vision recurring 
A dirty window I can see through

You think it's funny
But what I say is true
The reason that I live like this
Is all because of you

You got me lookin' up high
You got me searchin'  down low
You got me I know you know
You got me jerkin' back 'n' forth

You got me lookin' up high
You got me searchin'  down low
You got me I know you know
You got me jerkin' back 'n' forth
