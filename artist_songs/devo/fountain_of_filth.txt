There it was 
Just like old faithful 
The eternal fountain of filth 

I took a walk 
Straight out of town 
But then I stopped 
And took my time for pleasure 

I was alone 
I looked around 
I heard a voice 
So I buckled up for safety 

I saw myself 
There on the ground 
A pool of sound 
It showed my own reflection 

In a fountain of filth 
It was a fountain of filth 
Eternal fountain of filth 

I tried to run 
I couldn't move 
Frozen stiff 
While the thoughts of men threatened me 

Out of my head 
The fountain shot 
And drowned me in a serum 
That I couldn't put a stop to 

It was me 
Myself and I 
Locked in a struggle 
With the talking head below me 

I got a hunger 
That makes me do things 
I got a hunger 
That makes me say things 
I got a hunger 
That makes me want things 
I'm just a victim of filth 
Eternal fountain of filth 

But, nowhere are we safe 
From the power of 
From the reach of 
From the appeal of 
Eternal fountain of filth 
Fountain of filth 
Eternal fountain of filth 

I got a hunger 
That makes me do things 
I got a hunger 
That makes me say things 
I got a hunger 
That makes me want things 
I'm just a victim of filth 
Eternal fountain of filth 

Nowhere are we safe 
From the power of 
From the reach of 
From the appeal of 
Eternal fountain of filth 
Fountain of filth 
Eternal fountain of filth 

I got a hunger 
That makes me do things 
I got a hunger 
That makes me say things 
I got a hunger 
That makes me want things 
I'm just a victim of filth 
Fountain of filth 
Eternal fountain of filth 

I got a hunger 
That makes me do things 
I got a hunger 
That makes me say things 
I got a hunger 
That makes me want things 
I'm just a victim of filth 
Fountain of filth 
Eternal fountain of filth 

I got a hunger 
That makes me do things 
I got a hunger 
That makes me say things 
I got a hunger 
That makes me want things 
I'm just a victim of filth 

I - I
