Listen comrade, I don't care
How long you want to grow your hair
It doesn't matter to me

Hey lady, have you heard teh news?
You can burn your wig and burn your shoes
It doesn't matter to me

But there's something bigger than my VCR
Something important and it's waiting for you
Oh yeah

Knock it off pal I heard your story before
Tell me something new, that's what I'm waiting for
It doesn't matter to me

'Cause there's a train comin' into the station
But it's headin' for a new destination
And I tell you my friend you better count me in

Listen comrade, I don't care
If you ever change your underwear
It doesn't matter to me
