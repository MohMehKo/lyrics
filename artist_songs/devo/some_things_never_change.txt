Hang your head
Hang your head
Hang your head
Hang your head

Some things never change
Some things never change

Hang your head
Hang your head

I heard the news today, oh boy
(Hang your head)
A thousand starry skies we've seen before
(Hang your head)

Small minds play at some big time games
And everybody else pays
Make no mistake, they're on the take
They like to keep it that way

Some things never change
Some things never change

I was the light today, oh boy
(Hang your head)
It came on flashing bright, in red and blue
(Hang your head)

The man steps in with a terminal grin
Blue skies turn to gray
Young men die and the children cry, why is
It always the same?
(Hang your head)

Life must be eaten, or at least bitten into
To get past the surface, the moment of truth
You know when it's right, it's sweet deep inside
It's real and it's better that some things don't change

I saw the news today, oh boy
(Hang your head)
A thousand pictures of the lies we live
(Hang your head)

Small minds play at some big time games
And everybody else pays
(Hang your head)
They're on the take, and they don't give breaks

They like to take it away
(Hang your head)
(Hang your head)

Some things never change
(Hang your head)
Some things never change
(Hang your head)

Man steps in with a terminal grin
Blue skies turn to gray
(Hang your head)
Young men die, and the chldren cry, why is

It always the same?
(Hang your head)
(Hang your head)
(Hang your head)
