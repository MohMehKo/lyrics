I am a human rocket on a mission of deployment
I've been cocked and loaded, ready for the culmination
I am a human missile guided by a secret agenda
That commands my every thought(s) and deed(s) and wills me on my way.

I am a human rocket on a mission of redemption
I've been cocked and loaded, primed by everything I know
I am a human missile guided by a secret voice
That commands my every action and wills me on my way

There is no turning back, there are no second thoughts
First things first and all things fair, be it love or war, they say
There is no plan named B on the land in the air or on the sea
This is what's supposed to be, my duty now awaits me

I am a human rocket on a mission of instruction
I've been primed and programmed since the beginning of time
I am a human missile guided by a secret master
That commands my every motion and wills me on my way

I've found my target, I've reached my co-ordinates
I'm set to detonate and resonate - the final poem I will create
I've made a video - it tells a story, oh....
I guess it's time to go - don't forget to rewind.

I am a human rocket on a mission of destruction
I've been locked and loaded and ready for the confirmation
I am a human missile guided by a secret perfection
That commands my full conviction and wills me on my way

Large parts of the experience will go by unnoticed
We are all distracted by the lights and sounds of everything and nothing
Do you remember the breath you took when I let you off the hook?
And sent you swimming away back into your cell?

I am a human rocket on a mission of reduction
I've been cocked and loaded since the dawn of time
I am a human missile guided by a secret voice
That commands my every thought and deed and wills me on my righteous way.
