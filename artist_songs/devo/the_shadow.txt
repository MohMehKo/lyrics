Dr. jekyll 
And mr. Hyde 
A real nice guy with a na na n-na nasty side 
In trouble 
He tried to hide from himself 
Good gawd 
Sad man 
Couldn't face up to the yin and the yang 
Everybody 
All of us got a shadow

Who knows what lurks in the hearts of men 
The shadow knows 
We become what we do not what we pretend

Between the intention and the expression 
Between the emotion and the response 
Falls the shadow

Sometimes I fail to follow through 
On things that I want to do 
Other times I find myself doing the very things I hate.

Reverend jimmy 
And Tammy belle 
Big time pumpers with a story to tell 
Wait a minute 
Their fingers pointing at you 
Pay attention 
Listen up 
Don't try to deny it or cover it up 
Everybody 
All of us got a shadow
