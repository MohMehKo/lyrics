Love comes in spurts
And love is all around us
Love is what it does
Sometimes it hurts
Does that strike you
Rather strangely, does it ever love?

Please, please, please
No need to be so cruel
Please, please, please
Don't treat me like a fool

Love comes in spurts
Sometimes it gets to be
Too much to rise above
If you love me
You would leave me
Leave me time to be alone

Please believe me
That would leave me
Time to love you

Does that strike you funny love?
Be-bop-a-lua
Be-bop-a-lua she's my baby

When it's over
Promise me that you'll go
When it's over
Promise you'll let me know

When it's over
Promise me that you'll go
Just because what it was
Becomes another empty cup of memories
