Supermarket flashbacks 
Show arms and legs in plastic sacks 
Fat men twelve bananas high 
Die while all the woman cry 

Love, love gets sucked away 
On big fat lips while people pray 
Boy plus girl make mess out of sex 
No babies come, what happens next?

De-evolution 
Self execution 
No solution 
I'm a potato and I'm so hip 

Teenage hoodlums stand in line 
Donate blood to pay for crime 
Butchers steal doctor's tools 
Sow pretty heads on dogs and mules 

Hi-fi systems, men in pairs 
Tape bodies falling down the stairs 
Father-son teams split the cost 
Of nighttime girls but all is lost 

To de-evolution 
Self execution 
No solution 
I'm a spudman, I got eyes all around 

Martian feet turn dirt and stone 
For buried treasure, human bone 
Madison men, tattoo ads 
On ten year olds with sucker pads 

Rockets rust, attack, decay 
Things tall apart while spacemen play 
Now daddy zero drops his brown 
Go down, go down, go down

To de-evolution 
Self execution 
No solution 
I'm a spudgun, I'd like to shoot 'em all
