Something in the air
Is telling me to go there
So I'll follow my nose
Go wherever it goes

It's calling from around the corner
Waiting just outside of town
Trailing vapors sweet and tangy
Daring me to track it down 

It's blanketing the high-rise towers
Blasting through the sands of time
It's useless to resist its power
It's now or never

So fresh!
I'll search until I find it
So fresh!
I'm closing in behind it
So fresh!
Nothing could be better
So fresh!
Like I died and went to heaven 

So fresh it almost makes me want to cry
So fresh it's givin' me a second life

I see a fork in the road
Where it goes I don't know
I won't even think twice
I really don't have a choice

It's calling from around the corner
Waiting just outside of town
Trailing vapors sweet and tangy
Daring me to track it down 

It's blanketing the high-rise towers
Blasting through the sands of time
It's useless to resist its power
It's now or never

So fresh!
I'll search until I find it
So fresh!
I'm closing in behind it
So fresh!
Nothing could be better
So fresh!
Like I died and went to heaven 

So fresh!
So fresh!
So fresh!
So fresh!

So fresh it almost makes me want to cry
So fresh it's givin' me a second life

So fresh it almost makes me want to cry
So fresh it's givin' me a second life

So fresh!
