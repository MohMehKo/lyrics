Someone said that no-one knows what
Goes on inside someone in love
Strange as it seems
It makes them do things
In their right minds
Would never think of

People get away with things they don't deserve
The jurisdiction of love
Enough's not enough when love gets rough
The jurisdiction of love

Off the wall
Just like Niagara Falls
Logical thought is no comfort
It only makes the matter seem worse

Might equals right
In concubial fight
The jurisdiction of love
Love equals war
I dont like it no more
The jurisdiction of love

Someone said that no-one knows what
Goes on inside someone in love

People get away with things they don't deserve
The jurisdiction of love
When love turns the crank it turns carte blanche
The jurisdiction of love
Might equals right
In concubial fight
The jurisdiction of love
Love equals war
I dont like it no more
The jurisdiction of love
