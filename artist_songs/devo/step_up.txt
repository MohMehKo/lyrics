Listen up ya'll
It's D-E-V-O

They say the night time is the right time
So now it's high time to choose your destiny
Take a hard line, let some fur fly
Learn to stay high above the stormy sea

They say the new age is the big rage
And the next stage will bring us to the edge
Now escape from your golden cage
Then turn the page on the demons in your head

You gotta step up
Get to the bottom of it
Dig deep and go behind the scenes
You gotta step up
Get to the bottom of it
Go deep, show 'em what it means
You gotta step up
Pull down and take a number
Hold firm, nip it in the bud
You gotta step up
Pull down and take a number
Be firm, figure out what's what
Step up

They say the right time is the night time
So it's about time to do what you please
Avoid the drive-by grip tight and steer right
Into some fine wine 'til you're buzzed and feelin' free

It's not over 'til the cows come home
It's not over 'til the fat lady sings
It's never too late to grab some gold
It's never too late to shake that thang

So you gotta step up
Get to the bottom of it
Dig deep and go behind the scenes
You gotta step up
Get to the bottom of it
Go deep, show 'em what it means
You gotta step up
Pull down and take a number
Hold firm, nip it in the bud
You gotta step up
Pull down and take a number
Be firm, figure out what's what
Step up
