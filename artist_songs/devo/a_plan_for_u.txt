A plan for you 
A plan for you 

Weave to the left 
Bob to the right 
Or you'll be a flat tire 
On the freeway of life 

Go get active 
Change your luck 
Lay with yatta-yatta’s 
And treat 'em rough 

Come your turkey 
Drop your load 
Please don't let the tin man 
Get your goat 

Stay horizontal 
Don't look back 
If you do you'll give your mom and dad 
A heart attack 

Check your oil 
Change your mind 

Keep it up 
Like a pup 
Your battery will go before 
You know what's up 

Look for a socket 
Wear flesh-colored pants 
Big babies go the distance 
In wrap-around fat 

Dig your diddle 
Clean your nose 
When trouble gets behind you keep your 
Back door closed 

Okay, so you're skinny 
It’s a hard-edged game 
Jelly men are weak links on the 
Daisy chain 

Sleep on you belly 
Reach for the sky 

Weave to the left 
Bob to the right 

Keep it up 
Like a pup 

All right
