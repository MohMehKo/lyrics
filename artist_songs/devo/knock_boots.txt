Keep on knockin', keep it up, knock boots
Keep knockin', keep it up - until the end, now

White trash, celebrities, talking heads and tabloid sleaze
War reports and violent crime, hideous news almost all the time
Feelin' really low, then I start to wonder how to stop myself from goin' under
It flashes super-bright, I realize the surest way to prove we're still alive

Knock boots until u die now

You never know when they're gonna pull the plug
So knock boots until the end
You think there's more, but suddenly there's none
Keep on knockin', keep it up now
Don't you cut and run when trouble comes around now
Knock boots until the end
Don't let it tweak you out, don't let it bring you down
Keep on knockin', keep it up

Talkin' loud, sayin' nothin', sayin' what enough's enough
They dumb it down 'til it's all the same
Talkin' loud, sayin' nothin', sayin' what enough's enough
They stir the pot 'til everything's insane
What did they just say?
Wait!  Don't tell me!  Time to start knockin'!

O yeah

Keep knocking
Keep it up-up-up-up

The goons talk, the creeps arrive
The suits laugh as they rob you blind
Bigger Ballers and self-appointed cops
In attack dog mode, they just won't stop

Feelin' really low, then I start to wonder how to stop myself from goin' under
It flashes super-bright, I realize the surest way to prove we're still alive

Knock boots until u die now

You never know when they're gonna pull the plug
So knock boots until the end
You think there's more, but suddenly there's none
Keep on knockin', keep it up now
Don't you cut and run when trouble comes around now
Knock boots until the end
Don't let it tweak you out, don't let it bring you down
Keep on knockin', keep it up now
