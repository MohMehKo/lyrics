I get up every day - it's a miracle, I'm told
Somehow I live to work, so I hit the road
Squeeze into my hybrid car, drive as fast as I can
While, I scan the rooftops - yeah, I scan the rooftops

Don't shoot - I'm a man!
Don't shoot - I'm a man!

I live in every city all around the world
Sometimes it's way too hot, sometimes it's friggin' cold
One thing's always the same, no matter what they say
There's way too many problems - way, way too many problems

Don't shoot - I'm a man!
Don't shoot - I'm a man!

You wish you were swingin' from the trees
You wish you were slicin' through the breeze
You wish you were king or queen
You wish you'd hit the lottery

But wishin' is for chumps, high-hopin' is for fools
They'll hunt you down and taze you, bro, for playin' with the rules

Don't shoot - I'm a man!
Don't shoot - I'm a man!

I've got a big dilemma to punt or go for broke
It's got me goin' sleepless - well I'm about to choke
So let me ask you something, answer if you can
Think before you answer - There is no correct answer
So don't shoot - I'm a man!
Don't shoot - I'm a man!

Don't taze me, bro!
Don't taze me, bro!
Don't taze me, bro!
Don't taze me, bro!
