The first time I saw you I knew 
There would be no other 
That tingle told us we were 
Meant for one another 

I'm calling you 
I'm calling you 
I'm calling, one, two, three 

Buttered beauties of the negroid north 
Come spread your tallow on me 
Oiled wonder of the midnight forest 
Toss down your glossy web 

She's got me by the lever 
Sticking it out, sticking it out 
In simulated leather 
Sticking it out, sticking it out 
I think she broke my tether 

C’mon, c’mon 
Keep on comin' on now
