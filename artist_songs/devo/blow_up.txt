When I see you 
I want to holler 
You make me steamy 
Under the collar 
You - you know you're my 
Sweet hot Chihuahua 
If I can't have you 
I'm gonna get blowed up 
Said blow up 
Hot Chihuahua 
Why don't you treat me to 
Your special flavors 
I can reciprocate with 
Some special favors 
Your such a hazard but 
You are my pleasure 
Don't get me boiled up or 
I'm gonna blow up
