Well, I kinda feel sorry for Jimmy
Yeah, but you don't know the whole story
He wasn't a nice guy
What do you mean?

Let me tell ya

Jimmy's in a wheel chair and I don't care
He used to walk his dog
And then he'd beat him good
Like his pretty wife and now they're up and gone

And jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care
He was the president of a company
He kept his workers poor
He'd lie and cheat and steal

Well, when justice strikes
Well, every once in a while
It makes a bullseye hit
Well, every once in a while

He used to yell and scream
Until his son would cry
Then he'd run him down
Well, he don't run no more

Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care
He got big and fat and he was ridin' high
Makin' lots of cash trashin' others' lives
Now jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care

Lord, he had it comin'
Now he's cryin' in his beer
Lord, have mercy on this man
