MC yells "I'm free
Hey dude!  Comin' through"
As he mows 'em down

In his truck, pedal's stuck to the floor
4x4, burnin' oil by the ton

I walked outside, it hit me on the dome
If you don't want trouble, you should stay at home
In the day-glo sky above the devolved city
I looked up and saw the banner big and bold

"Later is Now"
Sooner or later, everybody gets it right
Later is now!
Sooner or later, everything comes to light
Later is now

Lotta Gold on the phone
Dishin' dirt 'til it hurts
Sends 'em all to hell

Stalks their prey every day
Nasty blog, it's a job
Makin' trouble pays her well

I walked outside, it hit me on the dome
If you don't want trouble, you should stay at home
In the day-glo sky above the devolved city
I looked up and saw the banner big and bold

"Later is Now"

Tomorrow is a replay, so tonight I'll try to sleep
I'll deal with it later!
I'll deal with it later!
I'll deal with it later!

Later is now!
Sooner or later, everything comes to light
Later is now!
Sooner or later, everybody feels the bite
Later is now!
Sooner or later, everybody gets it right
Later is now!
Sooner or later, everything comes to light
Later is now!
