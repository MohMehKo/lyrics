She was walking all alone 
Down the street in the alley 
Her name was sally 
I never touched her
She never saw it 
When she was hit by space junk 
In New York Miami beach 
Heavy metal fell in Cuba 
Angola Saudi Arabia 
On Xmas eve said Norad 
A soviet sputnik hit Africa 
India Venezuela (in Texas 
Kansas) 
It's falling fast Peru too 
It keeps coming 
And now I'm mad about space junk 
I'm all burned out about space junk 
Oooh walk & talk about space junk 
It smashed my baby's head 
And now my sally's dead
