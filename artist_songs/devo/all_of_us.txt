I left home with a friend of mine 
Gone two years and I don't know why 
Now I’m happy all the time 
I don’t think and I’m feeling fine 

I got feelings but they don't show 
Don't ask me cause I don't know 
No, no 
No, no, no 

All of us 
All of us 
All of us 

Think you've heard this all before 
Now you're gonna hear some more 
I know a place where dreams are crushed 
Hopes are smashed but that ain't much 

All you stupids anyway 
We're all gonna die some day 
Yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 

All of us 
All of us 
All of us 

All of us 
All of us 
All of us 

Me leave home with Booji Boy 
Teeth fall out of China doll 
Poo-poo man got jiffy-snipped 
Bad girl laughing, floppy tits 

Listen, listen, me no lie 
We like stuff what makes us cry 
Why, why 
Why, why? 

All of us 
All of us 
All of us 
All of us 
All of us 
All of us 
All of us
