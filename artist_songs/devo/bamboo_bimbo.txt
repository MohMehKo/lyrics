Well he caught his first whiff 
In the jungles of ‘Nam 
That slant-eyed catfish 
Tasted better than mom 
Now every single night 
She drops her big bomb 

'Cause he's a 
Bamboo bimbo, bamboo bimbo 
Those hook marks really show 
'Cause he's a 
Bamboo bimbo, bamboo bimbo 
He went for it, now everyone knows 

Well he made his first catch in 
Field And Stream
That salt water taffy was a 
Fisherman’s wet dream
Now every single night 
He's still getting that big ream

'Cause he's a 
Bamboo bimbo, bamboo bimbo 
He fell for it and everyone knows 
And he's a 
Bamboo bimbo, bamboo bimbo 
Just a monkey with a ring in his nose 

He's a 
Bamboo bimbo, bamboo bimbo 
Those hook marks really show 
He's a 
Bamboo bimbo, bamboo bimbo 
It just goes on and on and on 
'Cause he's a 
Bamboo bimbo, bamboo bimbo 
Can't say I never told you so 

Ah, let me reiterate 

He caught his first whiff 
In the jungles of ‘Nam 
That slant-eyed catfish 
Tasted better than mom 
Now every single night 
She jus' drops him that big bomb 

'Cause he's a 
Bamboo bimbo, bamboo bimbo
