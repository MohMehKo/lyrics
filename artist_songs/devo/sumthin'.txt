Green means time to go
Go move over, bro
You're movin' way too slow
Maybe you should know

I'm the leader of the western world
The big decider in the neighborhood
I'm floatin' hope on an ocean of need
I'm Santa Claus, so look under your tree

I got sumthin' for everybody
Sumthin' for everybody
Alright

Red says time to stop
Stop the givin' up
Run, now ditch the walk
Next, get back on top

I'm here to fix it so it runs like new
But the bankers tell me "No can do"
I'm facin' problems way beyond control
I'm talkin' smooth, but I'm deep in the hole

Now, tell me what I say
Sounds like a line
Trust me, every word is true
Just don't ask me why

I got sumthin' for everybody
Sumthin' for everybody
Sumthin' for everybody
Sumthin' for everybody
Alright

Psycho pundits keep on fannin' the fire
Spin the story, then they call me a liar
Tellin' me how I should do my job
Droppin' crumbs for the angry mob

al-Quaeda and the Taliban, fundamentally way out of hand
I keep tryin' to turn it all around
But the New World Order wants to take me down

They got sumthin' for everybody
Sumthin'
