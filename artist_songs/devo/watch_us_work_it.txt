Hey
I thought I heard somebody say
"This dog ain't goin' home
Until he gets his bone"

Hey
They said that way he'd be OK
So when he's home alone
He'd bark "ain't nothin' wrong!"

Now, watch us work it
Work it out
Watch us work it
Work it inside out
Watch us work it (work it)
Work it out
Now, watch us work it (work it)
Work it inside out

Baby, we can work it out
Let's put it back together
Maybe we can work it out
Let's put it back together
Baby, we can work it out
Let's put it back together
Maybe we can work it out
Let's put it back together

Hey
My baby said to me
"I feel so DEVO"
I don't know what to do

Hey
It's OK because she's free
"How low can you go?"
That's really up to you

Now, watch us work it
Work it out
Watch us work it
Work it inside out
Watch us work it
Work it out
Watch us work it
Work it inside out
Now, watch us work it (work it)
Work it out
Now, watch us work it (work it)
Work it inside out
Watch us work it (work it)

So, watch us work it (work it)
Work it inside out

Baby, we can work it out
Let's put it back together
Maybe we can work it out
Let's put it back together
