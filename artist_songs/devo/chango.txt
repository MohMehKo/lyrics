I come up the river like meat man
I come up the river like Skunkman Fly
I come up the river to kill many people
I come up the river with my laser gun

Dear Uncle, dear Uncle, dear Uncle
Dear Uncle, dear Uncle

Your son just had intercourse with baggy breast
Your son just had intercourse with Death Debbie

My mommy didn't hold me when I was young
She didn't give me breast and went insane
My mommy didn't hold me when I was young
She didn't give me breast and went insane

Now I come up the river like a meat man
I come up the river like Skunkman Fly
I come up the river to kill many people
I come up the river with my laser gun
