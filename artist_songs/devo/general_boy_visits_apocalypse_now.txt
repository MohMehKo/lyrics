Salutations. Today I feel a sense of urgency as I state to you for Devo Incorporated.

There is a direct connection between Devo's work in the music field and a big wiggly world around us. You may not be aware of this, but we are in the middle of World War Three. It is not nuclear bombs that we must fear; the weapons is the human mind or lack of it on this planet. That will determine our fate. Capital punishment for airline passengers who attempt to save money; Spud Men in gas lines who forget that guns don't argue, and tourists attempting to catch some rays at Three Mile Island add up to a major attack of corkscrews in the brain.

We must fight back. We must know what we want. We must want what we need, and what we need now is Duty Now For The Future.
