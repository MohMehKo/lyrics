Life is a game, that's what they say
U gotta pay to play, but everything's gonna be Alright!

Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na

C'mon and do it - let's do it!
It's time to do it - let's do it!

Time flies too fast, Stay hip, don't snap
U'r gonna score - relax
'Cause everything's gonna be Alright!

Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na

It's getting easy to be
Be myself and be free
Free from the world that I see
See crashing down around me
Me hear what everyone say
Say I still do it my way
Way out until the big day
Day that I'm taken away

C'mon and do it - let's do it!
It's time to do it - let's do it!
C'mon and do it - let's do it!
It's time to do it - let's do it!
