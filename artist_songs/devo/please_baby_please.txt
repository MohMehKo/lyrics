Please baby please baby
Baby, baby, please baby

Please baby please baby
Baby, baby, please baby

Please baby please baby
Baby, baby, please baby
Give me some of that, heal me with that
Please baby please baby
Baby, baby, please baby
Know what I'm talkin' about, goin' down without

(Whooooooooah...)
I'm lost in the desert and I'm dyin' of thirst
(Whooooooooah...)
I'm graspin' at straws, I'm chasin' a mirage
(Whooooooooah...)
I'm sure to expire, 'less you get here first
(Whooooooooah...)
Got my GPS working, hope it's still working

Please give me some
Whatever sum is greater
Walk like a perp and be my perpetrator
Please give me some
Sooner than later
Walk like a perp and be my perpetrator

Please baby please baby
Baby, baby, please baby

Please baby please baby
Baby, baby, please baby

BABY PLEASE!

(Whooooooooah...)
I'm lost in space, floatin' upside-down
(Whooooooooah...)
It's cold and dark, I'm a dog with no bark
(Whooooooooah...)
I'm sure to drift away unless you bring me down
(Whooooooooah...)
Throw me a tether, please, throw me a tether

Please give me some
Whatever sum is greater
Walk like a perp and be my perpetrator
Please give me some
Sooner than later
Walk like a perp and be my perpetrator

Please baby please baby
Baby, baby, please baby
Give me some of that, heal me with that
Please baby please baby
Baby, baby, please baby
Know what I'm talkin' about, goin' down without
