It's the middle of the month, it's happening all over town
You know it's got me reeling forward, got me falling to the ground
There's a new mag on the market, it's the best around
All the guys are talking, it's the best they ever found
All the guys are talking, 'cause they all want some

It's got me reaching in my pocket, got me forking over cash
'Cause there's something in the middle and it's giving me a rash
Now every single month, it's the same old trash:
There's a girl in the middle with a finger in her gash
There's a boy there in the middle with a reamer up her ass

Penetration!

It's the middle of the month, it's happening all over town
Know it's got me reeling forward, got me falling to the ground
It's got me reaching in my pocket, got me forking over cash
'Cause there's something in the middle and it's giving me a rash
There's a girl in the middle with a finger in her gash

Penetration!
Penetration in the centerfold!
Penetration!
Penetration!
Penetration in the centerfold!
