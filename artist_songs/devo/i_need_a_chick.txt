I need a chick 
I need a chick 
I need a chick 
Well, I need a chick 

I need a chick 
To suck my dick 
I need a dog 
To lick my hog 

Well, I need a cat 
To stroke my bat 
Well, I need a chick 
To suck my dick 

I'm puking and shitting and dying of thirst 
I ain't got no field to plow 
There's no hole for my pole 
I'd fuck a mink stole 

I need a chick 
To suck my dick 
I need a dog 
To lick my hog 

I need a cat 
To stroke my bat 
Well, I need a chick 
To suck my dick 

And when I find her 
And when I find her 
And when I find her 

I'm gonna get down on my knees 
I'm gonna eat her 

‘Cause she's the moon 
‘Cause she's the moon 
‘Cause she's the moon 
Well, she's the moon 

I need a woman who understands 
There's nothing more spiritual 
Than doggy-style love 
There's nothing more spiritual 
Than doggy-style love 
There's nothing more spiritual 
Than doggy-style love 
There's nothing more spiritual 
Than doggy-style love 

Well, I need a chick 
To suck my dick 
I need a dog 
To lick my hog 

I need a cat 
To stroke my bat 
Well, I need a chick 
I need a dog 
Well, I need a cat 
Well, I need a cat 
Well, I need a dog 
Well, I need a cat 
Well, I need a chick 
To suck my dick 
Well, I need a dog 
To lick my hog 
Well, I need a chick 

Well, I need a chick (whoah)

Whoah 

(Ooh, your dick feels great)
