Ever since you came around 
Wiggling under my skin 
I've been stuck in the lost 'n found 
Feeling just like a helpless pin 

You got me bug, bug, bug, bug, bugged 
Girl, I don't know what to do 
You got me bug, bug, bug, bug, bugged 

You fluttered on down 
As graceful as can be 
Then you stuck in your needle 
And sucked my blood 
It was the love-age that came over me 

You got me bug, bug, bug, bug, bugged 
Girl, I don't know what to do 
You got me bug, bug, bug, bug, bugged 
I'm always bugged over you 
[alternate version:] Girl, I’m up and down over you)

Now I’m hopelessly entangled 
In the web of love you dangled 
Helpless like a worm 
You watch me twist and squirm 
Your love has left me strangled 

You got me bug, bug, bug, bug, bugged 
Girl, I don't know what to do 
You got me bug, bug, bug, bug, bugged 
Girl, I’m all bugged-out over you 
You got me bug, bug, bug, bug, bugged 

Now I’m hopelessly entangled 
In the web of love you dangled 
Should have trusted sick fear 
Now you sucked out all my blood 
Your love has left me strangled 

You got me bug, bug, bug, bug, bugged
