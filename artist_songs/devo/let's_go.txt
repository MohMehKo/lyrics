Up on the buzzer 
Quick on the start 
Let's go, let's go, let's go 

Reach for the counters 
And fill your car 
Let's go, let's go, let's go 

For it's hi-dee-ho 
You know where you want to go 
Don't be a shmoe
Get in the show 

Bounce off the backboards 
And block that pass 
Let's go, let's go, let's go 

Grab her by the neck 
And throw her down 
Let's go, let's go, let's go 

Ga-ga-go, go, goo 
You know what you want to do 
Kick 'em in the shoe 
Till your through

Beat it down the path
And catch that early worm
Let's go, let's go, let's go 

Throw her in the ditch 
And cover her with dirt 
Let's go, let's go, let's go 
Letâ€™s go 

Let's go, let's go, let's go, yeah 
Let's go, let's go, let's go
