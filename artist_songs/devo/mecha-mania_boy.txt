This is the boy who burns the books 
This is the way he always looks
This is the boy who smashed his car
This is the boy who went too far 

Washed his eye with yellow soap
He stole his daddy's microscope 

All alone, we're not proud 
never say his name aloud
now he wants to know your little mistakes
where he goes, and whence he came
it's a mecha-mania boy 

This is the boy who never sunk
He ain't the one who destroys his young
Oh, no
Everybody that's the way to roll 

All alone or on the telephone
he knows the time you spend at home
Oh, No
Never say I didn't tell you so 

Washed his hands of a deadly fate
he put himself in an altered state 

In a crowd or all alone
no-one's laughing anymore
now he wants to know your little mistakes
where he goes, and whence he came
he's a mecha-mania boy


All alone, we're not proud
never say his name aloud
now he wants to know your little mistakes
where he goes, and whence he came
it's a mecha-mania boy 

In a crowd or all alone
no-ones laughing anymoer
now he wants to know your little mistakes
