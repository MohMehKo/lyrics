I got a surprise from my honey
I got a message from my girl
When she picked up a pen from the side of her and
Wrote me a scribbled note
That she was coming back to see
She was visiting real soon
Gonna get up from the long, white bed
And leave this cold white room

Wah-ooo

We was once more living together
From an all-night loving spree
Just like the morning accident
My baby, well, look at me
I saw her sweet face trembling as she tried to open her eyes
I jumped with the joy of a grateful boy the day my baby gave me a surprise

Wah-ooo
