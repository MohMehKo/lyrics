You know I can be found
Sitting home all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone

Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

Well baby, if I made you mad
Something that I might have said
Please just forget the past
The future looks bright ahead

Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

Well, I don't want no other lover, baby
It's just you I'm dreaming of

Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

Ah, let's go to a preacher
And let us say I do
Then you'll know you have me
And I'll know I got you

Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

Well, I don't need no other lover, baby
It's just you I'm dreaming of

Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

Well, I don't want no other lover, baby
It's just you I'm dreaming of
