Auto mow down 
Down in Youngstown 
Bodies in the street 

Auto mow down 
Noon in downtown 
Bodies with no feet 

Auto mow down 
Noon in Youngstown 
Bodies got the blues 

Auto mow down 
Up in downtown 
Bodies with no shoes 

An acid-head goon 
In a 55' Dodge 
Didn't mean to do it 

But a sidewalk run 
In the noon-day sun 
Ten to one, he had to lose it
