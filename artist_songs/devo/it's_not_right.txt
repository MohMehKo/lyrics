baby baby baby hurt me bad 
baby baby 
baby baby made me cry 
baby 
I wanna die 

somebody tell me where she's hiding out 
I gotta find that cheatin' gal 
can't go can't go can't go sleep at night 
can't sleep can't sleep 
it's not right 
sunlight sunlight in my eyes 
sunlight 
makes me rise 
I can't sleep until my baby says it's over 
I gotta hear it face to face 
I love you darlin' it's a cryin' shame 
the way you run around like you're in a big game 
i'm so unhappy I could cry every time I think about you 
boo hoo 

baby baby baby please come back 
baby baby 
sunlight sunlight in my eyes 
sunlight 
makes me rise 
I can't sleep until my baby says it's over 
I gotta hear it face to face 
I love you darlin' it's a cryin' shame 
the way you run around like you're in a big game 
I shoot around in a trance all day and think about you 
all the time 

I love you darlin' it's a cryin' shame 
the way you run around like you're in a big game 
it's so unfair that you're so happy when i'm hurtin' inside 

I love you darlin' it's a cryin' shame 
the way you run around like you're in a big game 
i'm so unhappy I could cry every time I think about you 
boo hoo
