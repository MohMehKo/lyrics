Intersecting love lines 
Drew us closer every day 
Always kept your distance 
When you felt my presence near you 
love keeps on rolling over

Fly in retreat 
I would follow without shame 
A stupid spud staggering to the flame 
To be had and rehad 
Be a victim of the pain 
Now it's strange, it's so strange 
it's a strange pursuit 
it's a strange pursuit 
it's a strange pursuit

I come running like a fatboy 
In lead shoes 
But like a fatboy 
Huff puffing after you 
It's hopeless to hope for 
The one thing that I'm wanting 
'Cause it's strange 
It's so very strange

It's a strange pursuit 
Darling, I'm dazzled 
But you know I'm too Frazzled 
It's a strange pursuit 
Makin' my mind up 
While it lies in little pieces 
It's a strange pursuit

You know it's getting tough 
When you're getting real rough 
It's a strange pursuit 
Darling, I'm dazzled 
But you know I'm too frazzled 
It's a strange pursuit 
Makin' my mind up 
While it lies in little pieces 
It s a strange pursuit
