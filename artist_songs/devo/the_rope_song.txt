I found a girl with a pretty face 
I tied a rope around her waist 
I know when she's in and when she's out 
Well there ain't nothing to guess about 

She covers her ears when I play my guitar 
She runs away but not very far 
Push a button, retractable cord 
I pull her back when I get bored 

Woman, I am bound to you 
Woman, I am bound to you 
What do I want to do? 

One word from her and she'd be free 
But she's exactly where she wants to be 
Magnetic madonna she glows in the night 
Reciprocal pull, I flow to the light 

Woman, I am bound to you 
Woman, I am bound to you 
What do I want to do? 

Woman what do I want? 
Woman what do I want? 
Woman what do I want? 
Woman what do I want? 

I found a girl with a pretty face 
I tied a rope around her waist 
I know when she's in and when she's out 
Well there ain't nothing to guess about  

Woman, I am bound to you 
Woman, I am bound to you 
What do I want to do? 

Woman what do I want? 
Woman what do I want? 
Woman what do I want? 
Woman what do I want?
