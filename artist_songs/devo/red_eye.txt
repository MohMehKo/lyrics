Let me tell you a story 
Let me shovel some dirt 
Long time, no sugar 
And it s starting to hurt

Something's flattened my cola 
Something's wrong with my brew 
Something's rotten in Idaho 
And I don't know what to do

Gone, gone, gone 
With the red eye distress 
Gona, gone, gone 
On the Red Express [x4]

Only go around once 
Gotta quench that thirst 
Gotta grab that gusto 
Gotta get there first

Something's flattened my cola 
Something's wrong with my brew 
Something's rotten in Idaho 
And I don't know what to do

Gone, gone, gone 
With the red eye distress 
Gona, gone, gone 
On the Red Express [x8]

Red Eye Express [Repeat]
