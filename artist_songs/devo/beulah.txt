Beulah
You are so beautiful
Beulah
You feel so big
Beulah
There is so much of you to love.

And when I wake up in the morning
You look so good, naked
You feel so good, to me, to me



Beulah
You are so beautiful
Beulah
You feel so big
Beulah
There is so much of you to love.
[x2]

Love, love, love, love, love [repeating]
