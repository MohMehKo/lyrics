Three cheers! 
They're yellin' again 
Three cheers! 
They'll be at it to the end 

So drink some big beers and go crazy tonight 
They're all dressed up and they'll be gettin' it tonight 
Big swingers in double knits tonight 
Big babies gonna get in a fight 
Actin' crazy bustin' up the chairs 
Doubled over gettin' sick on the stairs 
They know the limits 'cause they cross them every night 
The dull sensations as it turns real hot 
Why, the guys in the back with their heads on the floor 
Surrounded by their buddies they're all hollerin' for more 
Whoa whoa whoa 
It's mr. b's ballroom 

Party time turn the music up loud 
Party time lose your head in the crowd 
Yellin' laughin' tryin' hard to act smart 
Put 'em under pressure and you watch them fall apart 
Freeze! come on out of there 
Freeze! you ain't goin' nowhere 
Freeze! put your hands on your head 
Freeze! 
It's mr. b's ballroom 

Whoa whoa whoa 
It's mr. b's ballroom 
[repeat]
