Vigor vim vitality and punch
The ability to act on a sudden hunch
Nerve to tackle the hardest thing
Feet that climb and hands that cling
A heart that never forgets to sing
That's pep [x3]

Sand and grit in a concrete base
A friendly smile on an honest face
A spirit that helps when another's down
Knows how to scatter the blackest frown
Loves its neighbor, loves its town
That's pep [x4]

Say "I will" for you know you can
Look for the best in every man
Meet each thundering knockout blow
Come back with a smile 'cause you know
You'll get the best of the whole damn show
That's pep [x6]

You know thats pep
