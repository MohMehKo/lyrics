Hello.  This is Devo.
We would like to say things go both ways.
New ideas, stupid moves, nightmares or dreams come true.
Mucho work minus play, tension mounts in a twisted face.
Dark clouds in a crystal ball, tension mounts in a foreign place.
The screw turns, someone calls:

TIME OUT FOR FUN! 

So you're living under the gun.
Circumstances have you on the run.
A doctor frowns, you feel bad.
Take this!  You've just been had!

Don't you lose it - now listen to us:
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT!
Take a break - take some time;
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT!
Don't you lose it - remember to take 
TIME OUT FOR FUN!

So your life has just begun.
Somebody else is saying that it's done.
Nurses whisper, others grin -
Something's funny at your expense again!

Don't you lose it - now listen to us:
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT!
Take a break - take some time;
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT!
Don't you lose it - remember to take 
TIME OUT FOR FUN!
