She tries on dresses half her size
She whines "These labels all tell lies"
She wiggles 'til you give her love
Then says "I'm jumpin' off your bus"

Love is mind games
Love is mind games

She complains, you listen nice
Then get's P.O.'d by your advice
She waits until it's time for bed
To question what's inside your head

If you think black is black and white is white
Open up your eyes and get it right

Love is mind games
Love is mind games
Love is mind games
Love is mind games

If you think the chemistry that makes you stupid
Is the same as the stuff that makes you smart
All I can say to you, my friend
Is that you're off to a bangin' start!

Playing mind games
Playing mind games

I try and try hard to believe
A guy and girl can live in peace
I get laughs when I explain
We could escape the House of Pain

If you think the sky is blue or the grass is green
Open up your eyes, see what I mean

Love is mind games
Love is mind games
Love is mind games
Love is mind games
