March on
March on

He was a brave little soldier marching far from home
He was lost and he was lonely, pretending to be bold
He was a brave little soldier marching all alone
He was looking for some answers, he was looking for some love

Letters froze inside his mind
Spelling words that seemed to say
Everything would be revealed in some twisted way

God
A big idea - reality or make-believe?
Sex
A great idea - but where does it ever lead?
Love
A nice idea - then do we ever really know?
The End
It's bound to happen
But in the meantime, it's on with the show on with the show!

March on

He was a brave little soldier marching in the snow
He had a chip on his shoulder too bad he didn't know
He marched into the future thinking time was on his side
With no woman on his shoulder, life just passed him by

Letters froze inside his mind
Spelling words that seemed to say
Everything would be revealed in some twisted way

March on
