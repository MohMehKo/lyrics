Itchy, itchy goo 
Got me thinking of you 
Itchy goo, itchy goo 
Oh, baby, I love you 
Itchy goo, itchy goo 
Itchy goo, goo, goo 
It's all I wanna do 
Whammo 

Itchy, itchy goo 
There's a pile next to you 
Itchy goo, itchy goo 
And it's turning blue 
Itchy goo, itchy goo 
Itchy goo, goo, goo 
It's all I wanna do 
Whammo 

You got me running in circles 
Like a big, big baby 
I'm so happy I just wanna die 
‘Cause this baby love 
It comes from up above 

Move on over 
I wanna get closer 
Move on over 
Wanna twaddle with you 
Move on over 
Satisfy my urges 
Please, please help 
I got the goo, goo itch 

Itchy, itchy goo 
There's a pile next to you 
Itchy goo, itchy goo 
And it's turning blue 
Itchy goo, itchy goo 
Itchy goo, goo, goo 
It's all I wanna do 
Whammo 

You got me running in circles 
Like a big, big baby 
I'm so happy I just wanna die 
‘Cause this baby love 
It comes from up above 

Move on over 
I wanna get closer 
Move on over 
Wanna twaddle with you 
Move on over 
Satisfy my urges 
Please, please help 
I got the goo, goo itch 

Itchy, itchy goo 
Got me thinking of you 
Itchy goo, itchy goo 
Oh, baby, I love you 
Itchy goo, itchy goo 
Itchy goo, goo, goo 
It's all I wanna do 
Whammo
