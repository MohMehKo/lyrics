All right 
Clock out 

I got my coat, I got my keys 
I got my head down to my lungs 
And move my feet 
Me, I got all the secretaries 
Down on their knees 

Look at ‘em scoot 
They gonna clock out 

I got my money tied up in stock 
I got my mammy take my 
Doggie for a walk 
Me, I got the biggest little business 
Down on the block 

Get ready, get set 
‘Cause we gonna clock out 

[Demo Verse - Hardcore Devo]
I’m making sales, hand over fist 
I’ve got a bedroom just to sleep 
Between my hips 
Me, I got a six-figure unit 
That’s never been kissed 

Down on all fours 
‘Cause we gonna clock out 

Take my advice, hear my decree 
I'm afraid the futures gonna be 
Maintenance free 
I got the big brush for your bowl 
Baby can’t you dig my plea 

Gonna gag 
Unless we-a clock out 

Oo-hoo, no, no, no
