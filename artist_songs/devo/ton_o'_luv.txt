When love takes a back seat to life 
When a man runs away from his wife 
That's when you know 
He's in the world 

When a guy tries to round up his mate 
But she's gone and it's gettin' too late 
That's when you know 
He lost his girl 

So it happens 
All the time 
Don't get low 
Just stand in line 
Take your turn 
Now make your move 
And crush that doubt 
With a ton o' luv 

When woman takes a back seat to man 
She has to tell him where to go if she can 
And she decides 
To wear his ring 

So it happens 
All the time 
Don't get low 
Just stand in line 
Take your turn 
Now make your move 
And crush that doubt 
With a ton o' luv 

Find a girl with the face of a clock 
Hands move forward 'til you can't stop 
She comes from above 
With a ton o' luv [x12]
