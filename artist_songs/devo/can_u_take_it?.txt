Can you take it? 

Popeye's big punch 
Knocks Bluto cold 
Cartoon people 
Don't go old 
Yosemite Sam 
Blows up his head 
But you and me 
Wind up dead 
Dreamed I laid a toaster 
Daddy caught me in the act 

Can you take it? 

Beauty queens 
Get bigger all the time 
Mamma's in a basket 
Crossed a double yellow line 
Magazines and T.V. 
Show us nice behinds 
All the kind of stuff 
Nobody ever finds 
Headlines in the paper: 
â€œKilled by rock n' roll" 

Can you take it?
