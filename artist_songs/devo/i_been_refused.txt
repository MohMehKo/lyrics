Sitting after supper 
Watched the FBI 
I asked for a cigarette 
I got no reply 
Then you dropped your culottes 
Revealing rubber underpants 
Sweat was forming in my shoes 
But you ended our romance 

I been refused 
I lost my shoes 

Last Monday morning 
Minus twenty degrees 
Walked to unemployment 
On my knees 
Left without my money 
Tried to make my trial 
Judge said you're the porno king 
Go to jail for a while 

I been refused 
I lost my shoes 

Bought a Kodak Brownie 
Developed film at home 
Took some shots of sister 
Pants were full of foam 
Took a couple back views 
Took some up front 
Three tries, wallet size 
I was looking at that cunt, but 

I been refused 
I lost my shoes 

Went topless bowling 
Tried to get some stuff 
It was a lesbo love scene 
Strictly treat 'em rough 
Everything created 
Under earth and sky 
Wants to be mated 
It must couple or must die, but 

I been refused 
I lost my shoes 

I been refused 
I lost my shoes 

Sitting after supper 
Watched the FBI 
I asked for a cigarette 
I got no reply 
Dogs in the ocean 
Pigs in the sea 
Well, come on baby 
And wakka-wakka-wakka with me 

I been refused 
And I lost my shoes
