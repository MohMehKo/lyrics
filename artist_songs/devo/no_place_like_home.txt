A song of truth and beauty for you
In the bigger scheme of things
We haven't been around here more than a moment
And yet too many, it seems,
Believe we are creating a brand new world around us--
We are creating a brand new world without us

Maybe it really is okay,
Although we're digging our own graves at this moment
If we should all just disappear
The skies and waters will clear in a world without us

And there's no place like home
There's no place like home
There's no place like home 
To return to

We push against the rest of life
As if we can survive without the world around us

Can't have a rainbow without the rain
Can't have a painting without the pain
Can't have a lover walk out
Without the love leaving with them

There's no place like home
No place like home
To return to

And there's no place like home
There's no place like home
There's no place like home 
To return to

And there's no place like home
There's no place like home
There's no place like home 
To return to
