I had the body of a two and a half year-old baby 
I had the brain of a man 
I used to play underneath my momma's skirts all day 
I parked my car in her garage 

She didn't know I was a midget 
She thought it was all innocent play
She didn't know I was a midget 
But when dad came home she put me away 

She didn't know I was a midget 
She thought it was all innocent play 
She didn't know I was a midget 
But when dad came home she put me away 

She didn't know I was a midget 
She thought it was all innocent play
She didn't know I was a midget 
But when dad came home she put me away 

She didn't know I was a midget 
She thought it was all innocent play
She didn't know I was a midget 
But when dad came home she put me away 

Hey, hey, oh, ho
