You, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Another hairdo 
Mobutu shoes 
This Roman nose 
You're uglatto 

You grin like a star 
The grille of a car 
Fat Oldsmobilo 
A puffed potato 
This Roman say: 
Ugh-latto 

You, a bad tomato 
Speak Esperanto 
So desperato 
And constipato 
This Roman nose 
You're uglatto 

Why do you wiggle 
So you make me 
Ho-ho 
In front of people 
You are so 
Uglatto 

You grin like a star 
The grille of a car 
Fat Oldsmobilo 
A puffed potato 
This Roman say: 
You're uglatto 

You, a bad tomato 
Speak Esperanto 
So desperato 
And constipato 
This Roman nose 
You're uglatto 

Why, oh, do you wiggle 
So you make me 
Ho-ho 
In front of people 
You are so 
Uglatto
