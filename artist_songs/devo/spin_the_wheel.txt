When I was young I thought I stood
On solid ground, well that proved wrong
Everything I knew was true
Blew up in my face

Isn't life wonderful?
I really didn't think so
I took my chips and cashed them in
Let the games begin

Cos it's easy
It's perfectly easy
To spin that wheel round
Til you turn it all upside-down
It's easy
It's perfectly easy
To let that wheel spin
Til the numbers come back right to you

Now spin that wheel
There's nothing to lose
Spin that wheel
It's waiting for you
Now spin that wheel
Let the wheel decide
Spin that wheel
Go along for the ride
Spin the wheel
You lose!

When I was young and set to move
I started looking forward to
The fun that disappeared so soon
I wanted to check out

Isnt life wonderful? 
I didnt used to think so
I took my chips and cashed them in
And started up again

Now it's easy
It's perfectly easy
To spin that wheel round
Til you turn it all upside-down
It's easy
It's perfectly easy
To let that wheel spin
Til the numbers come back right to you
