Something good is coming to my life
I don't know what it is, don't know what is like
But I, I can feel it in my heart tonight
Something good is coming to my life

Something good is coming to my home
It's calling out my name and knocking on my door
and I perfumed my bed with myrrh and cinnamon
'cause

Something good is coming to my heart
Something good is coming to my home

But I've been waiting a long time
dreaming of your love
much better than wine

I've been waiting so long
I've been searching for your lips
whispering a kiss
shinning in your smile

I've been waiting so long

Something good it lighting up my soul
I don't know how it came
I don't know where it goes
But I, I can tell you is much better than gold

Something good it lighting up my soul
Something good it lighting up my soul

But I've been waiting a long time
dreaming of your love
much better than wine

I've been waiting so long
I've been searching for your lips
whispering a kiss
shinning in your smile

(I've been waiting)
Something good is coming to my life (something)
I don't know what it is, don't know what is like
But I, I can feel it in my heart tonight
I can feel it in my heart tonight

Something good is coming to my life
Something good is coming to my life

Something good is coming
Something good is coming
Something good is coming
Something good is coming, right away

Something good is coming
Something good is coming
Something good is coming
Something good is coming
Something good is coming, right away, right away

Something good is coming
Something good is coming
Something good is coming
Something good is coming
Something good is coming, right away

Something good is coming
Something good is coming
Something good is coming
Something good is coming
