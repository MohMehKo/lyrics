Many cages many rules
Many battles in my blues
Many days without a clue
But, you came and turned me loose

Call you when things don't go my way
You have the world that hits my brain
Heal me with your touch, anoint me
Because your love is all I need

It's all about you
You're the one who lives inside my mind
A message falling from the sky
And a revelation of the moon

It's all about you
You are the one who stays and never goes
A solitary spotlight in my show
You are the one who plays the violin in my
Caribbean blues

I've got the habit of your smile
My dwelling place around your heart
Heal me with your touch, anoint me
Because your love is all I need

It's all about you
You're the one who lives inside my mind
A message falling from the sky
And a revelation of the moon

It's all about you
You are the one who stays and never goes
A solitary spotlight in my show
You are the one who plays the violin in my
Caribbean blues

Por la marea, las olas llegan
Por la marea

Searching in the evening
Stars above the ocean
Falling constellations
You are the only light I know

Water takes a river
Far beyond the mountains
In every road I take now
Youâ€™re the only way that I know

It's all about you
You're the one who lives inside my mind
A message falling from the sky
And a revelation of the moon

It's all about you
You are the one who stays and never goes
A solitary spotlight in my show
You are the one who plays the violin in my
Caribbean blues
