How many days
Could I count in a week
Since that Monday
I found you were gone?

How many tears
Should I drop without healing
The sadness that I carry on?

Just listen to my heart
I don't want to stop
My heart
Burning with your touch
My heart
Beating with your love
Harder than I ever thought.

Look through my eyes
I will open your dreams
Like the wind
Gently opens the door.

Although tonight
Could be July 19th
Time makes no sense
Without you no more.

Just listen to my heart
I don't want to stop
My heart
Burning with your touch
My heart
Beating with your love
Harder than I ever thought
With your love

Hello, blue sky
Tell her I'm still alone
Rain on my lips
Until her kisses come

You'll never know, listen
