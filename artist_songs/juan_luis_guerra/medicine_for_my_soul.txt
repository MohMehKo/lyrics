Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I was listening to a radiostation last night
A shrink, Dr. Luis, was giving counsel on the line

I dialed 305 594 1185
(three o' five, five ninety-four eleven eighty-five)
Hey doc, I'm calling about a latin girl I met on a web site

She tastes to me like a honeycomb
y tiene la llave de mi corazón

Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

I'm from Louisiana, she's from San Pedro de Macoris,
you know the land of baseball players,
where Sammy Sosa lives

She likes to drink papaya juice and paint caribbean trees
Oh, we don't have too much in common
but love is blind as you can see

She tastes to me like a honeycomb
sweet to my heart, medicine for my soul

Girl I want to feel your heart
and hope you love me too

You know I can't stop loving you, babe
I said mambo

Love me, yeah
Love me, yeah

Establish your emotions
make a point, you're on the air

Should I go and visit her
should I learn spanish words
should I cry, should I face
some political concerns

Should I join a social club
Should I peel a coconut
movin' in, movin' on,
merengue bachata y son, now

She tastes to me like a honeycomb
y tiene la llave de mi corazón

Dance!
Dance!
yeah yeah yeah yeah
Dance!

Should I get down on my knees
should I dance a latin beat
Should I laugh should I get
a romantic membership

Should I play my conga drums
should I sing 'La Vie en Rose'
Moving in, moving on
merengue, bachata y son, now

She tastes to me like a honeycomb
y tiene la llave de mi corazón

Girl I want to feel your heart
and hope you love me too

You know I can't stop loving you, babe

She tastes to me like a honeycomb
y tiene la llave de mi corazón

You're so sweet, to me, yeah
You're so sweet
You're so sweet, to me, baby
You're so sweet, to me, baby
You're so sweet
yeah yeah yeah

She tastes to me like a honeycomb
y tiene la llave de mi corazón

Sweet to my heart
ehh baby now
Sweet to my heart
Sweet to my heart
Sweet to my heart
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Sweet to my heart
yeah baby

She tastes to me like a honeycomb
tu tienes la llave de mi corazón
