Dream when you're feeling blue
Dream that's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings in-n the air
You'll find your share of memories there

So dream when the day is thr-ou-gh
Dream and they might come true
Things are never as bad as they seem
So dream dream dream

Dream when you're feeling blue
Dream that's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings in the air
You'll find your share of memories there

So dream when the day is through
Dream and they might come true
Things are never as bad as they seem
So dream dream dream
