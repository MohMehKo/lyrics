[Stevie Wonder:]
See the girl with the diamonds in her shoes? Yeah
She walks around like she's got nothing to lose
Ya she's a go-getter, she's everybody's type
She's a queen of the city but she don't believe the hype
She's got her own elevation, holy motivation
So I wrote some letters out in big bold type

[Stevie Wonder & Ariana Grande:]
I got faith in you baby, I got faith in you now
And you've been sucha, sucha good friend to me
Know that I love you somehow
I met you, hallelujah, I got faith

[Ariana Grande:]
See the boy with the Stevie Wonder swag?
Ain't got a clue, all the magic that he has
He's a go-getter, he's everybody's type
Gonna make it my mission, make him feel alright
He's a twelve on a ten point, rockin' out to his joint
Just say the word cause I could sing all night

[Stevie Wonder & Ariana Grande:]
I got faith in you baby, I got faith in you now
And you've been sucha, sucha good friend to me
Know that I love you somehow (love you somehow)
I met you, hallelujah, I got faith

Faith, yeah
Yes I do, mmm
I get around ya and my mind goes crazy
I think about you mornin', noon, night and day
I get around ya and my mind goes crazy
I think about you mornin', noon, night and day
I get around ya and my mind goes crazy (I got faith in you honey)
I think about you mornin', noon, night and day (I got faith in you girl)
I got faith in you honey, I got faith in you girl
I met you, hallelujah

I got faith in you baby, I got faith in you now
And you've been sucha, sucha good friend to me
Know that I love you somehow (love you somehow)
I met you, hallelujah, I got faith
(Faith, faith, baby)
I got faith in you baby, I got faith in you now
And you've been such a, such a good friend of me
Know that I love you somehow
I met you, hallelujah, I met you, hallelujah
I met you, hallelujah, I got faith
