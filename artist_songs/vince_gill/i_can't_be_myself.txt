It's a way of mine to say just what I'm thinking
And to do the things I really want to do
And you want to change the part of me I'm proud of
I can't be myself when I'm with you

You never liked the clothes I wear on Sunday
Just because I don't believe the way you do
But I believe the Lord knows I'm unhappy
Cause I can't be myself when I'm with you

I can't be myself and be what pleases you
Down deep inside I don't believe you really want me to
It's not my way to take so long deciding
I can't be myself when I'm with you

I can't be myself and be what pleases you
Down deep inside I don't believe you really want me to
It's not my way to take so long deciding
I can't be myself when I'm with you
I can't be myself when I'm with you
