Your leavin'
Just hit me right between the eyes
Had me believin'
All your little alibis
You're movin' on no matter how hard I try
I've got reasons
Reasons for the tears I cry

I'm seein'
Our love is goin' up in flames
I must be dreamin'
To think you still feel the same
Now you're gone, you left me wonderin' why, why, why
I've got reasons, babe
Reasons for the tears I cry

It's lookin' like we're done
You're about to run
To the arms of another man
Say it ain't so
Baby, don't you go
And break my heart even though you can
It's killin' me to hear you say to me "goodbye"
I've got reasons
Reasons for the tears I cry

It's lookin' like we're done
You're about to run
To the arms of another man
Say it ain't so
Baby, don't you go and break my heart even though
Even though you can
It's killin' me to hear you say to me "goodbye"
I've got reasons
Reasons for the tears I cry
It's killin' me to hear you say to me "goodbye"
I've got reasons, babe
Reasons for the tears I cry
