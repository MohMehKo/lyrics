You've got legs just like a longneck bottle
And lips just like strawberry wine
You might be a lifetime of trouble
Still I can't get you out of my mind

[Chorus:]
Out of my mind, I'm goin' out of my mind
And I see what I've been missing all this time
Oh sweet neon angel, don't leave me behind
No I can't get you out of my mind

You're bringin' on a honky-tonk heartache
And I know you'd never walk the line
To let you slip away, a chance I won't take
Still I can't get you out of my mind

[Chorus]

No I can't get you out of my mind
