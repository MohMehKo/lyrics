I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing, dear, if you're not here with me

I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain
And when that blue heartache starts hurting
You'll be doing all all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

You'll be doing all all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

You'll be doing all all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
