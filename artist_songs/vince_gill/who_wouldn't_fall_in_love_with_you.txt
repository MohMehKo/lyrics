You catch every eye,
Girl when you pass by,
There ain't no wavin' you don't know.
Look at the way you shine,
You've got this heart of mine
Beating so it won't let go.

Who wouldn't fall in love with you?
The moment you walk in the room,
I know for me it'd be impossible to do
Who wouldn't fall in love with you?

Seems like you've always been,
Everyone's best friend,
The kind your folks would talk about.
A smile I just can't miss,
The kind you can't resit,
Just one kiss there'd be no doubt.

Who wouldn't fall in love with you?
The moment you walk in the room,
I know for me it'd be impossible to do
Who wouldn't fall in love with you?

Who wouldn't fall in love with you?
The moment you walk in the room,
I know for me it'd be impossible to do
Who wouldn't fall in love with you?
Who wouldn't fall in love with you?
