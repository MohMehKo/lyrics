You don't need diamonds or big fancy cars
You say your happy right where you are
We're bound together by a little gold band
You're my kind of woman
Oh, you're my kind of man

Oh living without you is my only fear
You still drive me crazy when I hold you near
My body trembles with each touch of your hand
You're my kind of woman
Oh, you're my kind of man

[Chorus:]
You're my kind of woman
You're my kind of man
A match made in heaven
By God's gentle hands
I'll love you forever
Together we'll stand
You're my kind of woman
You're my kind of man

[Chorus]
