Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate to be out in the storm
But if you really wanna hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbying
As long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Let it snow, let it snow, oh yeah
Let it snow, let it snow, let it go
Let it snow, let it snow, oh yeah
It's coming on down for miles around

Let it snow, let it snow, oh yeah
Let it snow, let it snow, let it go
Let it snow, let it snow, oh yeah
It's coming on down for miles around
Miles around

Oh the fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbying
As long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Let it snow, let it snow, oh yeah
Let it snow, let it snow, let it go
Let it snow, let it snow, oh yeah
It's coming on down for miles around

Let it snow, let it snow, oh yeah
Let it snow, let it snow, let it go
Let it snow, let it snow, oh yeah
It's coming on down for miles around

Let it snow, let it snow
