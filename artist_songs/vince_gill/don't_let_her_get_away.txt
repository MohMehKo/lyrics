There's nothin' like the feelin'
When you finally find someone
You're wastin' your time
Thinkin' the whole thing through
If you take her for granted
Man, it's gonna come undone
Don't wait another minute
'Cause she's in love with you

[Chorus:]
Don't let her get away
Don't let her get away
Don't let her get away

Well, every gun town would love
To be in your shoes
They've never seen a woman
Ever look so fine
They're all waitin' for the chance
To walk all over you
Son I'd have to tell
I'd be the first in line

[Chorus]

Any fool can see you've got it made
A love like this don't come around everyday

[Chorus 3x]

Don't let her get away
