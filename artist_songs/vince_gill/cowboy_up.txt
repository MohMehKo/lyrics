I'm putting on my favorite cowboy boots
Like a crazy bull rider coming out of the chute
Ready for some dancin', maybe too much beer
Like bare-back rubbin' going on in here

Hey little cowgirl leave the Stetson on
Let's cowboy up and down all night long

She said her name was Levitra Marcantonio
I'm a bare back rider, Okie, don't you know
These frozen margaritas are going to my head
I could not believe it when Levitra said

Hey mister cowboy come on and take me home
Gonna cowboy up and down, honey, all night long

All night long you're coming on strong
All night long come and do me wrong

Hey little cowgirl leave just your Stetson on
Gonna cowboy up and down, honey, all night long

Hey little cowgirl leave just your Stetson on
Gonna cowboy up and down till Levitra's gone
