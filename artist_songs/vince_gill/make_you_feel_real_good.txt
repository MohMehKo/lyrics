You say you will but you won't
You say you wanna but you don't
Gimme just a little kiss
Oh, how I love all of this
Babydoll, you know I would
Make you feel real good

Been goin' crazy since we met
You're about as tempting as it gets
You got me down here on my knees
Beggin' pretty pretty please
Well honey child I think we should
Make you feel real good

I'll make you feel all right
If it takes all night
What you got underneath your hood
I'll make you feel real good

I'll make you feel all right
If it takes all night
What you got underneath your hood baby
I'll make it feel real good

You said we shouldnt but we did
You know I ain't no kid
With sweat pouring off my skin
Said, do you wanna go again
Oh, I'm the little train that could
Make you feel real good
Yeah I'm the little train that could
Make you feel real good
