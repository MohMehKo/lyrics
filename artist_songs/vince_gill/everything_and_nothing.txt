It's like jail it's like flight
It's a dram that wakes you in the middle of the night
It's like chains, like an open door
Love is everything and nothing I've been looking for

It's coming home, it's lost at sea
It's a hopeless addiction to sweet misery
It's the poison, it's the candy store
Love is everything and nothing I've been looking for

[Chorus:]
I can't hide from the truth, this love I feel for you
It's the one thing I can't ignore
I know I can't explain the pleasure or the pain
Love is everything and nothing I've been looking for

It's like freedom, it's like a trap
It's a short trip to Heaven and a long ride back
Dance on the ceiling, and a crawl on the floor
Love is everything and nothing I've been looking for

[Chorus 2x]

Love is everything and nothing I've been looking for
