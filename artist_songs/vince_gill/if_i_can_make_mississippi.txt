If I can make Mississippi then I'll be alright
These ole white lines are lonely
On this two-lane tonight
I've got enough whiskey to keep me warm
Till the mornin' light
If I could make Mississippi, Mississippi tonight

I headed out west to seek my fortune and fame
I sure made a mess, took it all but my name
Why I ever left I can never explain
If I can make Mississippi through this pouring rain

If I can make Mississippi, then I'll be alright
These ole white lines are lonely
And the headlights are bright
I've got enough whiskey to keep me warm
Till the mornin' light
If I could make Mississippi, Mississippi tonight

She said she would wait
Said our love was strong
I'm just so afraid
I've been gone for too long
When I walk through that gate
Will she be there or long, long gone
If I could make Mississippi
If I could make it back home
If I could make Mississippi
If I could make it back home
