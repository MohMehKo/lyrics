[Chorus:]
I can't find a way to keep pretending
I'm doing all right on my own
And I can't find the strength to keep believin'
That you'll ever come back home

But I'm tryin' to put this behind me
I've been cryin' more than you know
I'd be lyin' to say this won't kill me
Oh I'm dyin' cause I can't let go

[Chorus]

Your perfume still lingers all around me
In our bedroom where I loved you so
I'd be lyin' to say this won't kill me
Oh I'm dyin' cause I can't let go
I'd be lyin' to say this won't kill me
Oh I'm dyin' cause I can't let go
