Well every morning starts the same old way
Same story just a different day
You think of her even though she's gone
It's never easy moving on
You see her face in every picture frame
Her voice whispering your name
Only memories remain
She'll never come back again

[Chorus]
You can hide the pain 
For a little while
The sunlight feels like rain
Still you try to smile
'Cause nothings gonna get you down
'Til silence is the only sound
That's when lonely comes around

Turn up the TV and the radio
Call somebody on the other coast
Stay up all night and walk around all day
Chasing a ghost away
Change your attitude and cut your hair
You try to act like you just don't care
Anything to keep her off your mind
Anyway to keep on killing time

[Repeat Chorus]

Nothing's gonna get you down
'Til silence is the only sound
That's when lonely comes around
No nothing's gonna get you down
'Til silence is the only sound
That's when lonely comes around
