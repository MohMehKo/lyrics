Love ain't for the faint of heart
The timid and the weak
Pour me one more on the rocks
And baby we'll just see

We'll start a fire
Pour the wine
Slip on in to these arms of mine

[Chorus:]
Love ain't for the faint of heart
Love's for you and me

What a rush when you kiss me that way
Your touch is gonna drive me crazy
Ooh, what a night this has been
Baby let's do it again

[Chorus]

What a rush when you kiss me that way
Your touch is gonna drive me crazy
Ooh, what a night this has been
Baby let's do it again

[Chorus]
