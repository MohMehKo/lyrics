It feels like you're at the bottom of an avalanche
You sit and cry cause he don't ever wanna dance
Give me the dice, give me half a chance with you baby
I look for you, just hoping you'll come in tonight
With that fool, the one who never treats you right
If you only knew how bad I burn for you baby

[Chorus:]
I'll do what I have to do
I'd beg, borrow, steal cheat and lie for you
I'll put it all on the line if you ask me to
I'll bet it all on you, every time, every dime
I'll bet it all on you

I think it's time for me to finally show my hand
This heart of mine has taken all that it can stand
I ain't blind, I can see you want me too baby
Come on, let's make a run for he parking lot
We can't wait, gotta give this thing a shot
I know it's crazy, but we ain't got a thing to lose

[Chorus 2x]
