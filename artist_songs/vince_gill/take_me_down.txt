Here you come again
With that wreckin' smile
The one that does me in every time
I wanna drink you in
And make you stay a while
Wonder if your heart is racing just like mine

I know you know just what you do to me
I feel your eyes, they cut right through me

You take me down every time you come around
And make me surrender for you
You found your way into every hiding place
And baby you burn me to the ground
You take me down

Every word you whisper
Turns me inside out
Your hands are makin' memories on my skin
Kiss after kiss
You melt away the doubt
You got me where you want me
I'm giving in

You take me down every time you come around
And make me surrender for you
You found your way into every hiding place
And baby you burn me to the ground
You take me down

And now you know just what you do to me
I'm undone by every way you move me

Oh I love the way you move me
You take me down

You take me down every time you come around
And make me surrender for you
And you found your way into every hiding place
And baby, you burn me to

You take me down every time you come around
And make me surrender for you
You found your way into every hiding place
And baby you burn me to the ground
You take me down
