Have you ever had a thing for a woman
A thing that makes you lose your mind
Everytime I start to think about her
Sends shivers up and down my spine
My daddy was a bit of a rounder
Siad these women are gonna make you go blind
Well I told my old man that I'm right over here
Like the way I see just fine

[Chorus:]
I'm the son of a ramblin' man
Son of a runnin' kind
I'm the son of a ramblin' man
Come from a long long line

Well I'm just a hillbilly gypsy
Ain't much for settling down
If I thought somebody might miss me
Maybe I'd have to hang around
So I better keep on drifting
Every town just a little too small
Ain't nothin' in the world like a woman
I'm going to try to love them all

[Chorus 3x]
