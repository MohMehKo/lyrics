He was sitting in the corner
At a table all a lone
A candle burnin' in the darkness
His glass of wine was almost gone

Something about him felt familiar
And it made me atop and a stare
The way he held his hands before him
Looked like he was lost in prayer

Hey son, what are you looking at?
Why do your eyes look so sad?
There's something in the way he sat there
Made me think about my dad

I'm looking for the answer
Just like everyone
I know that there's no ending
To the love between a father and a son

Hey son, why don't you pull up one of those empty chairs?
Bring it over here by my side
Buy me a glass of wine
This looks like a real good place to hide

You know I've always been a fisherman
Fishin' for souls along the way
You kind of remind me of my only son
I lost him 33 years ago today

I'm looking for the answer
Just like everyone
I know that there's no ending
To the love between a father and a son

There's somethin' I'd sure like to give you
It's a compass that my Father made
He told me it'd point you in the right direction
In case you ever lose your way
You know I've got somethin' here in my pocket
This little silver cross
I think my son would want you to have it
When you think all the hope is lost

We're looking for the answer
Just like everyone
We know that there's no ending
To the love between a father and a son

I left him sitting at his table
But I didn't feel alone
For a moment I could see the light
Oh we were almost home
For a moment I could see the light
Oh we were almost home
