Lying here in this sleepy town
Listening to the sun go down
The only one who hears the sound is you
You look at life so wild and free
I love the way you smile at me
The only love I'll ever need is you

[Chorus:]
I need you to start a clear blue mornin'
I need you at the end of a long hard day
Never see you wear a frown
Blues don't even come around
The only love I've ever found is you

We don't go much of anywhere
Sunday church and county fairs
The world looks good from these rocking chairs
It's true
Be my woman, I'll be your man
We'll go through life hand in hand
All I want to understand is you

[Chorus]

Never see you wear a frown
Blues don't even come around
The only love I've ever found is you
