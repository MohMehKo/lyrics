They say you'll lie, they say you'll cheat
And your kisses taste so sweet
If you're not in love then let me be
No baby don't pretend with me

That honky-tonk life you lead
With neon lights you'll never leave
Give me one reason to believe
But baby don't pretend with me

[Chorus:]
Your foolish heart will never change
I want no part of your love-sick games
I know you're wild and runnin' free
So baby don't pretend with me

I'll lay my poor heart at your feet
If you'll leave behind those lonely streets
Oh we could make some sweet memories
So baby don't pretend with me

[Chorus]

I know you're wild and runnin' free
So baby don't pretend with me
