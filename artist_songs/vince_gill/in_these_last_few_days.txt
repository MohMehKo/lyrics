In these last few days
You've been on my mind
We should get together
And talk about the old times
And put the past behind us
Before life slips away
I've been thinkin' about you
In these last few days

In these last few days
I have felt my age
I wish that I was younger
But time has turned the page
I sure miss the water
And the rhythm of the waves
I've been feelin' fragile
In these last few days

I have bee a faster
A husband and a son
Lookin' back is bittersweet
Now that my face has run
I've tired to be a witness
From the cradle to the grave
Time has felt so precious
In these last few days

In these last few days
I have seen the light
I'll be waiting for you
On the other side
My old friend, I love you
Is really all that's left to say
Lay down here beside me
In these last few days

My old friend, I'll miss you
But I'm trying to be brave
Lay down here beside me
In these last few days
