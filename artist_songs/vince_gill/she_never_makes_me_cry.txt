I saw an old lover
Today on the street
She said do you remember
How we used to be
On fire with that passion
We'd burn down those nights
No I haven't forgotten
How we used to fight

I finally got married
Settled on down
Yeah she's a preachers daughter
In a sleepy little town
Does she make you laugh
Since we said goodbye
No she ain't that funny
But she never makes me cry

She never makes me cry like you used to
There's nothing about her that reminds me of you
I promise I don't see your face when I look in her eyes
And she never makes me cry

Does she makes you beg
For her love in the night
No she ain't that selfish
And she never makes me cry

She never makes me cry like you used to
Theres nothing about her that reminds me of you
I promise I dont see your face when I look in her eyes
She never makes me wonder when she's coming home
There's something about her like I've never known
It's been nice to see you but now i must say goodbye
She never makes me cry
She never makes me cry

No...
She never makes me cry
She never makes me cry
She never makes me cry
