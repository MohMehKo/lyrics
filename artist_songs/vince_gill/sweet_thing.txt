I'd be out running most every night
We'd always end up in one hell of a fight
The end is comin' there ain't no doubt
But there's just that one thing I can't live without
Won't try to stop you can't change your mind
Been nice to know you, could you leave that sweet thing behind

You take the dishes, the silverware
I'll keep the hound dog and this easy chair
Keep the Ranchero, but that TV is mine
She said,'You can stick that clicker where the sun don't shine'
I know you're leaving can't change your mind
Been nice to know you, could you leave that sweet thing behind

That woman was real mean
My trailer park drama queen
I'm gonna have bad dreams
About missing that sweet thing
Oh Lord, I don't know what I am gonna do

Why's a tornado like a redneck divorce
Either way somebody's bound to lose a mobile home of course
Well that's my story, it's sad but true
I've only got one last request from you
I know you're leaving can't change your mind
Been nice to know you, could you leave that sweet thing behind
I know you're leaving can't change your mind
Been nice to know you, could you leave that sweet thing behind
