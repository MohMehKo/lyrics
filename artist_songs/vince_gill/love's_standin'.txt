Every morning when I wake up
I see you without your makeup
You still take me breath away
Ain't no grass that's any greener
I know there's nothing any sweeter
Than how you make me feel this way

When I look in your eyes
Any fool could realize
Love's standin' right in front of me

The whole world's in a hurry
But I don't have to worry
Cause I found what they're looking for
She whispered baby lay your head down
Slips off that flannel nightgown
How could any man ever wish for more

When I look in your eyes
Any fool could realize
Love's standin' right in front of me
When I see your face
I know I found my place
Love's standin' right in front of me

When I look in your eyes
Any fool could realize
Love's standin' right in front of me
When I see your face
I know I found my place
Love's standin' right in front of me
