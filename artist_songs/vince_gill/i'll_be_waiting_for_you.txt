I'll find a way to ease my mind
Friends to occupy my time
Oh I'll be waiting for you

I look for your face in the candlelight
Listen for you in the still of night
Oh I'll be waiting for you

People will see me out on the town
And tell you I've been running round
Baby you'll always know deep down
The truth
Oh I'll be waiting for you

I'll keep my word baby come what may
It's closer and closer with every day
Oh I'll be waiting for you

People will see me out on the town
And tell you I've been running round
Baby you'll always know deep down
The truth
Oh I'll be waiting for you

People will see me out on the town
And tell you I've been running round
Baby you'll always know deep down
The truth (you know the truth)
Oh I'll be waiting for you
Oh I'll be waiting for you
