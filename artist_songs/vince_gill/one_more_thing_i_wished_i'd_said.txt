So many nights you let me share your bed
That note on my pillow I never read
Oh losing you will haunt me ‘till I’m dead
Still I search for one more thing I wished I’d said

I tried to give you everything I could
If I could have you back, God knows I would
Oh, your name still echoes through my head
Still I search for one more thing I wished I’d said

Oh, I wish I said I loved you a million times
I wish I’d held your body closer, closer to mine
But you turned to another’s arms instead
As I search for one more thing I wished I’d said

Oh, I wish I said I loved you a million times
I wish I’d held your body closer, closer to mine
But you turned to another’s arms instead
While I search for one more thing I wished I’d said
What I’d give to have you back here in my bed
Still I search for one more thing I wished I’d said
