Long, long ago
In a world dark and cold
The night so still
Winter's chill
One bright star was shining

On a bed made of hay
In a manger he lay
The shepards came
They knew his name
King of kings, a brand new day

They saw the light in the darkness
It shines on us in tenderness
It brings out the hope that's in all of us
May it shine its light on you this Christmas night

On this Christmas day
May that star light your way
This Christmas Eve
I still believe
That same star still shines on me

I saw the light in the darkness
It shines on us in tenderness
It brings out the hope that's in all of us
May it shine its light on you this Christmas night

May it shine its light on you this Christmas night
