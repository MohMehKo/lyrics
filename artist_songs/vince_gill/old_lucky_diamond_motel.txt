Out on Route 66, way back to the sticks
Out on the old Chisolm trail
Just east of El Reno next to Ted’s Escondido
Sat the old Lucky Diamond Motel

Lucille and Madonna slinging cheese enchiladas
Chain smoking non-filtered Pall Malls
Old men shooting pool and cursing like fools
At the old Lucky Diamond Motel

[Chorus]
Yeah the old Lucky Diamond, Lucky Diamond Motel
The Queen of the old mother road
There’s color TV and the kids eat for free
At the old Lucky Diamond Motel

There’s air streams and truckers and two timing lovers
Teenagers out raising hell
There’s cowboys and shriners and old five and dimers
At the old Lucky Diamond Motel

Room 23 was the first time for me
A stripper named Rita Cantrell
I spent all of my money on that sweet Spanish honey
At the old Lucky Diamond Motel

[Repeat Chorus]

Oh the sign said, we doze but we never do close
I remember her red dress so well
Old Rita’s passed on, the neon sign’s gone
At the old Lucky Diamond Motel

There’s a big wrecking ball
Just tore down the wall, a piece of America fell
Now I’m all for progress, but god knows that I miss
The old Lucky Diamond Motel

[Repeat Chorus]
