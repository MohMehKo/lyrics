O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear savior's birth
Long the lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night devine
O night when Christ was born
O night
O holy night
O night devine
O night devine
O night, o night devine
