There was lipstick everywhere
Lingerie on the chandelier
The smell of sin and whiskey filled the air
There was lipstick everywhere

It all started with some whiskey
We danced real close and then she kissed me
Dim lights and too much crown
She said “Please don’t turn me down”

There was lipstick everywhere
A steamy, one night, love affair
We were spent but we didn’t care
There was lipstick everywhere

She had just the thing I needed
A woman’s love is undefeated
There ain’t much a man can do
When she offers love to you

There was lipstick everywhere
It felt good just lying there
All the loneliness disappeared
There was lipstick everywhere
The smell of sin and whiskey filled the air
There was lipstick everywhere
