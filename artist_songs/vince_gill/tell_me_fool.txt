She said she loved you,
In front of God and her mother.
So why you’re out there,
With your arms around another?

Tell me fool (Tell me fool)
What did she ever do to you?

She had your babies,
And she keeps them safe at night.
You chase the ladies,
Thinking everything’s alright.

So tell me fool (Tell me fool)
What did she ever do to you?

You made a promise,
When you put on that ring.
Well, does your conscience,
Make you feel anything?

Tell me fool (Tell me fool)
What did she ever do to you?

She keeps the fire in this warmin’ home
Waitin’ all alone
Listenin’ for you to hit that door.

Ooh but you come beggin’ in,
Telling lies again.
She’s heard em all,
She’s heard em all a million times before.

You think you’re something,
The way you lie about it all.
The truth is comin’,
The other shoe is gonna fall, yes it is.

So tell me fool (Tell me fool)
What did she ever do to you?

You made a promise,
When you put on that ring.
Well, does your conscience,
Make you feel anything?

Tell me fool (Tell me fool)
What did she ever do to you?
Yeah, tell me fool (Tell me fool)
What did she ever do to you?
Tell me fool (Tell me fool)
What did she ever do to you?
