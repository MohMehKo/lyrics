Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end

The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
No nothing else matters now
We're together again

Together again
All my gray skies are gone
You're back in my arms
Right where you belong

The love that we knew
Is living again
No nothing else matters now
We're together again

Together again
All my gray skies are gone
You're back in my arms
Right where you belong

And the love that we knew
Is living again
No nothing else matters now
We're together again

No nothing else matters now
We're together again
