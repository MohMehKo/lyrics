Come gather around at the table
In the spirit of family and friends
And we'll all join hands
And remember the moment
'Til the season comes round again

Let's all try to smile for the picture
And we'll hold it as long as we can
May it carry us through
Should we ever get lonely Til the season comes round again

One night, holy and bright
Shining with love from our hearts
By a warm fire, let's lift our heads high
And be thankful we're here
Til this time next year

May the new year be blessed with good tidings
Til the next time I see you again
If we must say goodbye
Let the spirit go with you
'Til the season comes round again

One night, holy and bright
Shining with love from our hearts
By a warm fire, let's lift our heads high
And be thankful we're here
'Til this time next year

May the new year be blessed with good tidings
Til the next time I see you again
And we'll all join hands
And remember this moment
And we'll love and we'll laugh
In the time that we have
'Til the season comes round again
