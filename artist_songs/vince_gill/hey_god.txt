Hey God I just lost a dear old friend
He God I hope he's in your angel bad
Hey God you know he believed in you
Just help us understand why you do the things you do

He God send me down some comfort please
Hey God I'll be down here on my knees
Hey God will we ever comprehend
The forgiveness and grace that lies waiting in the end

Oh there's anger and tears
For all of the years that your children won't have you to hold
Oh my heart has been broken
The angels have spoken still I wish I could watch you grow old

Hey God I know he didn't die alone
Hey God tell my old friend welcome home
Hey God please hear me when I pray
Pray for a little peace 'til we meet again someday
Pray for a little peace 'til we meet again someday
