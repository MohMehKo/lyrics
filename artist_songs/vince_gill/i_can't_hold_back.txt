The cold wind was blowin' through your hair
That's when I saw you, saw you standin' there

Can't hold back... the love I have for you. Gotta give you all I've got
What else can I do?... What can I do?

Met you at the doorstep, said won't you come inside?
Hope this lovely lady, take me for a ride

Can't hold back... the love I have for you. Gotta give you all I've got
What else can I do?... What can I do?

I see your glass is empty an' I know what's on your mind
Wrap your arms around me, let me make you mine

Can't hold back... the love I have for you. Gotta give you all I've got
What else can I do?... What can I do?
