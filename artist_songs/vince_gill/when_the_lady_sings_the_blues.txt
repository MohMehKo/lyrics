When this old world gets the, the best of me
Life don't come quite so easily
The only thing that brings a little peace to me
Is when the lady sings the blues

The worlds keep knocking on my front door
I just can't seem to pay the rent no more
The one thing that I keep longing for
Is when the lady sings the blues

Singing 'bout the hard time, standing in the silver line
Praying help is on the way
Feeling kind of helpless, hoping for some kindness
Waiting on that sunshiny day

Just when I think I'm gonna, gonna come on wild
Feels like the walls just start toppling down
The one thing that keeps me hanging around
Is when the lady sings the blues

Singing 'bout the hard time, standing in the silver line
Praying help is on the way
Feeling kind of helpless, hoping for some kindness
Waiting on that sunshiny day

'Good morning, Heartache', by Lady 'Day
'God Bless The Child', who chased my blues away
And ain't nobody's business gonna get me through
When the lady sings the blues

Ain't it nice what a little moonlight can do
When the lady sings the blues
When the lady sings the blues
When the lady sings the blues
