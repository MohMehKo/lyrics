[Chorus:]
Give me the highway
Lord knows I love to roam
Give me the highway
I can hear the lonesome whistle moan
White lines, neon signs, have always been my home
Give me the highway
Cause I was born a rollin' stone

Down every road I travel
Lord to you might look the same
But maybe you might tell me
Why every town's got a different name
I'd like to find a woman
That wasn't hell-bent to tie me down
Someone to be content
To go anywhere I'm bound

[Chorus 2x]

Give me the highway
Cause I was born a rollin' stone
