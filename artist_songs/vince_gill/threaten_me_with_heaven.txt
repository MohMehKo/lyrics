I can see the tears upon your face, no hiding place
And you're afraid that soon I will be gone, but time will still go on
You're searching for the answers you can find, all in good time

What's the worst thing that can happen,
If they say my time is through
Can they take away the love,
Or they years I've shared with you
What's the worst thing that can happen,
That's the worst that they can do
Threaten me with Heaven, it's all they can do
Threaten me with Heaven, if they want to
Threaten me with Heaven, I believe that it's true
Threaten me with Heaven, I'll be waiting on you

I hear angels through the window pane, calling my name
Someday when they carve my name in stone, I won't be, I won't be alone
If by chance a miracle appears, I'll dry your tears

What's the worst thing that can happen,
If they say my time is through
Can they take away the love,
Or the years I've shared with you
What's the worst thing that can happen,
What's the worst that they can do
Threaten me with Heaven, it's all they can do
Threaten me with Heaven, if they want to
Threaten me with Heaven, I believe that it's true
Threaten me with Heaven, I'll be waiting on you

What's the worst thing that can happen,
What's the worst that they can do
Threaten me with Heaven, that's all they can do
Threaten me with Heaven, ooh, I'll be waiting on you

Threaten me with Heaven,
Threaten me with Heaven
Threaten me with Heaven
