If love should come again from you
You could never count the ways of things I'd say an' do
And I would be more of a man than I've ever been
If I ever have the chance to be lovin' you again

I have been a fool...
That's what I am... I don't wanna lose you
What can I do...
My life ain't worth livin' if my love ain't worth givin' to you

An' all I wanna say is you're all I need
Hands like the sunshine touch me at the right time you're the air I breathe
An' I would be more of a man than I've ever been
If I ever have the chance to be lovin' you again

I've been a fool...
That's what I am... I don't wanna lose you
What can I do...
My life ain't worth livin' if my love ain't worth givin' to you

Well I've been a fool...
That's what I am... I don't wanna lose you
What can I do...
My life ain't worth livin' if my love ain't worth givin' to you

I've been a fool...
That's what I am... I don't wanna lose you
What can I do...
My life ain't worth livin' if my love ain't worth givin' to you...
