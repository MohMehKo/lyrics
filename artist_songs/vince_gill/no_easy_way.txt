From my room I can hear you laughing
You spend all your time with my best friend
Oh I wish you knew how bad I've fallen for you
There's no way to know how things may end

[Chorus:]
Babe I don't know where to start
The longing is the hardest part
Ain't no easy way into your heart

In my mind I can see us together
Crazy in love and paintin' the town
When you look at him I know there's no way I can win
If I came running for you would you turn me down

[Chorus 2x]
