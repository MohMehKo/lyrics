O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, o come ye
To Bethlehem

Come and behold him
Born the king of angels

O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
Christ the Lord

Sing choirs of angels
Sing in exhultation
Sing all ye citizens
Of Heaven above

Glory to God
In the highest

O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
Christ the Lord

O come let us adore him
Christ the Lord
