Midsummer night
Just you and I
The warmth of your skin
Kiss me again

When you're in my arms
And you're in my bed
You're my favorite movie
That runs through my head

Santa Fe skies
Stars in our eyes
Time won't stand still
This memory will

When you're in my arms
And you're in my bed
You're my favorite movie
That runs through my head

I see lovers on those Hollywood screens
They're pretending on that boulevard of dreams
This is real love like I've never seen
It's the sweetest thing

As we're dancing slow
The credits will roll
You're my best friend
Is how our story ends

Whey you're in my arms
And you're in my bed
You're my favorite movie
You're my favorite movie
You're my favorite movie
That runs through my head
