I've done some things that I hadn't oughta
Like coming home late with the preacher's daughter
I'd hit the back door seeing double
My ol' man waiting with a fistful of trouble

Sometimes you lose, sometimes you're a winner
Talk about love I ain't no beginner
I'm a sucker for a juke joint jumpin'
I never stop chasin' the scent of a woman

[Chorus:]
It's just the way that I've always been
Knock me down, I'm coming back again
I just sing, been there , done that
I come up smilin' song

I've been on top and I've hit the bottom
Tlak about hard times Lord, I've got 'em
Just keep runnin' and go full throttle
There ain't no answer in the bottom of a bottle

[Chorus 2x]
