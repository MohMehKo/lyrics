Painted as a victim
He said you caused it all
Lying to convince them
So you would take the fall

You walked out on nothin'
Hoping for some peace of mind

[Chorus:]
The pain is almost over
The hurt is nearly gone
No more looking over your shoulder
It's time to carry on

Scars won't last forever
The truth will take their place
Angry words will be forgotten
Contempt will fade away

The promise of tomorrow
It will always remain

[Chorus]

It's time to carry on
