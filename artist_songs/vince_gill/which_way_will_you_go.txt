Baby you need to put that bottle down
Put that gun back in the drawer
I hear your man's been out there runnin' around
You're hell'bent to even up the score

[Chorus:]
Don't let the devil get you by the throat
You pull that trigger, girl, that's all she wrote
Satan's waitin' for you down the road
Oh which way will you go

Your hands are shaking and your knees are weak
Pistol pointed at the door
You're tired of wearing bruises on your cheek
And being treated like a whore

[Chorus 2x]

Oh only Heaven knows

Baby you need to put that bottle down
Put that gun back in the drawer
