Kiss me like you'll never see my face again
As soft and tender as you can
Hold me like we'll never make sweet love again
Please make me feel like a man

[Chorus:]
So let's send up a prayer
For this love that we share
'Cause it could change in the blink of an eye
You just never know
How tomorrow will go
So let's make sure we kiss goodbye
Let's make sure we kiss goodbye

Look at me just like the day we fell in love
And found the missing pieces to our souls
You and me have always fit just like a glove
Wherever you are feels like home

[Chorus]
