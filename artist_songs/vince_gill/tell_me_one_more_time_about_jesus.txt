Tell me one more time about Jesus
All about forgiveness and grace
Tell me one more time about Jesus
All about my Savior's face

Here comes my old friend the preacher
He's knocking at my door
He's out tryin' to save all the sinners
He's been here so many times before

I love the easy conversation
Man that preacher sure can talk
Brings up my need for salvation
Even though he knows I'm stubborn to a fault

Tell me one more time about Jesus
All about forgiveness and grace
Tell me one more time about Jesus
Lord I need just a little more faith

I walked by the church Sunday mornin'
Slipped on in the back door
Sure been a long time coming
Tell preacher what I need to know

His words were like a cool drink of water
He said sinners come on down the aisle
So I went runnin' for the alter
Should have seen my old friend the preacher smile

Tell me one more time about Jesus
All about forgiveness and grace
Tell me one more time about Jesus
I long to see my Savior's face
I long to see my Savior's face
