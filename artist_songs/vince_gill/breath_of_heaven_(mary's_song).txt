We have traveled Many moonless nights
Cold and weary With a babe inside
And I wonder what I've done
Holy Father You have come
And chosen my love
To carry your son

I am waiting
In a silent prayer
I am troubled
By the load I bear
In a world as cold as stone
Must I walk this path alone
Be with me now
Be with me now

Beath of Heaven
Hold me together
Be forever near me
Beath of Heaven
Breath of Heaven
Lighten my darkness
Pour over me your holiness
For You are holy
Breath of Heaven

Do You wonder
As watch my face
If a wiser one
Should have had my place
But I offer all I am
For the mercy of your plan
Help me be strong
Help me be
Help me

Beath of Heaven
Hold me together
Be forever near me
Beath of Heaven
Breath of Heaven
Lighten my darkness
Pour over me your holiness
For You are holy
Breath of Heaven

Beath of Heaven
Hold me together
Be forever near me
Beath of Heaven
Breath of Heaven
Lighten my darkness
Pour over me your holiness
For You are holy
Breath of Heaven

Breath of Heaven
Breath of Heaven
