I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow
And mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas If only in my dreams

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow
And mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me (will find me)
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas If only in my dreams (in my dreams)

If only in my dreams
