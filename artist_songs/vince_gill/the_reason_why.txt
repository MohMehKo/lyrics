Why do I choose the things I choose
Why do I always find some lame excuse
And why do I not realize what I could do
Oh, I wish I knew the reason why

Why do you get that sad look on your face
And why do you pull away from my embrace
And why do you see all my faults and my mistakes
Oh, I wish you knew the reason why

Why do we treat each other like we do
It's like we never even tried
Why can't we get back to the love we knew
Oh why oh baby why

Why do we have to play the same old games
And why do we run away from who's to blame
And can't we see to lose this love would be a shame
Oh, I wish we knew the reason why
Oh, I wish we knew the reason why
