Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmastime in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas Day

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmastime in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas Day

Strings of street lights
Even stop lights blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all the bustle you'll hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmastime in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas Day

Soon it will be Christmas Day
Soon it will be Christmas Day
