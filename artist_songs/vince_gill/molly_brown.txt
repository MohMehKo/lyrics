Molly Brown waits for me
In a little one-horse town
Boley, Oklahoma, where white folks don't come around
I'm thinkin' about you, Molly
I'm forbidden to come around
Lord knows I love you Molly
Molly Brown

Molly Brown, Molly Brown
Lay down by my side
Show me how to spread your wings and let that pony ride
I'm crazy about you , Molly
I don't care that your skin is brown
Lord knows I need you Molly
Molly Brown

We met down by the river
She wore her wedding gown
Never saw it coming
No one heard a sound
My daddy used both barrels
And left me there to drown
Lord knows I'd die for Molly
Molly Brown

Molly Brown, Molly Brown
Don't you weep for me
I'm going to a place the Lord
Prepared for you and me
I'll meet you up in Heaven
Upon that Holy ground
I'll be waitin' for you Molly
Molly Brown
