Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the blue bird, here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say "Are you married?" We'll say, "No, man"
"But you can do the job if you're in town"

Later on we'll conspire, as we dream by the fire
To face unfraid the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening

Gone away is the blue bird, here to stay is a new bird

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say "Are you married?" We'll say, "No, man"
"But you can do the job if you're in town"

Later on we'll conspire, as we dream by the fire
To face unfraid the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland

Yeah, I'm walking in a winter wonderland
Yeah, I'm walking in a winter wonderland
