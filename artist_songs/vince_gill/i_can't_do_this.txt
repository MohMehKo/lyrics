It's always hard
When I see your face
No I don't know why
I came in this place
I've never been in here before
I see you dancin' cross the floor

Oh he holds your hand
And I hold my breath
The way you look at him
Scares me to death
Why can't I turn and run
I'm as broken as they come

No I can't do this
I'm comin' apart with each kiss
Baby, I've seen that red dress hangin' on our bedroom door
Why do I watch this
He's holding the one that I miss
It's like comin' up on a car crash
You look 'til you can't take it anymore

The way he's touching you
So tenderly
And his wanting you
Oh, it's breaking me
No I can't turn away
I can't let go of yesterday

This is haunting me
It's misery
So many memories

No I can't do this
I'm comin' apart with each kiss
Baby, I've seen that red dress hangin' on our bedroom door
Why do I watch this
He's holding the one that I miss
It's like comin' up on a car crash
You look 'til you can't take it anymore

I can't do this
No I can't do this
Why do I watch this
It's like coming up on a car crash
You look til you can't take it anymore
