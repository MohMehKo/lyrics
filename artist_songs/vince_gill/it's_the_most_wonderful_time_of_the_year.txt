It's the most wonderful time of the year
With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you "Be of good cheer!"
It's the most wonderful time of the year

It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings
When friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all

They'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And carolling out in the snow
They'll scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, lost ago

It's the most wonderful time of the year
They'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time of the year

They'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And carolling out in the snow
They'll scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, lost ago

It's the most wonderful time of the year
They'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time
It's the most wonderful time
It's the most wonderful time of the year
