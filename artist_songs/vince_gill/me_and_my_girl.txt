I love some bluegrass pickin'
I love little Jimmy Dickens
Granny Lucy's fried chicken on a sunday afternoon
Just puttin' off a monday
My baby right beside me
Out drivin' in the country underneath a yellow moon

Roll down the windows
Let that old wind blow
Right through your hair
Not a care in the world
We'll take the long way
Down a two lane highway
Headed for nowhere just me and my girl

I love the hand that my holding
I wish we could keep going
Without anybody knowing if we're ever coming home
We'll stop around mid night
For one dance in the moonlight
Your kisses feel like nothing I've ever known

Roll down the windows
Let that old wind blow
Right through your hair
Not a care in the world
We'll take the long way
Down a two lane highway
Headed for nowhere just me and my girl

Roll down the windows
Let that old wind blow
Right through your hair
Not a care in the world
We'll take the long way
Down a two lane highway
Headed for nowhere just me and my girl

We'll take the long way
Down a two lane highway
Headed for nowhere
Just me and my girl
