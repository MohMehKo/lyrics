I lose myself in this place
Strangest smile on my face
The Hand of blessing or beginner's luck
Here I stand on the rock of your love

Somethin' steady sure feels good
I always knew somehow it would
I've traded chains for the wings of a dove
Standin' on the rock of your love

[Chorus:]
Let the storm clouds roll
Let the rain flood my soul
I'll still be here when the troubles come
Standin' on the rock of your love

If this ole world should fade away
If I got you, I ain't afraid
I will face whatever comes
Standin' on the rock of your love

[Chorus]

I'll still be here when the troubles come
Standin' on the rock of your love
