I've sung along with a thousand songs
That talk about good-bye
Of letting go of who you love
Trying to sleep at night
How you cry when you decide to finally walk away
Babe I swear I never thought I'd ever see this day

[Chorus:]
So this is how lonely looks
And how that final feels
Funny how it only took
Goodbye to make it real

I never knew that losing you
Would tear my world apart
Who could've known I'd be alone
With just me broken heart

[Chorus 3x]
