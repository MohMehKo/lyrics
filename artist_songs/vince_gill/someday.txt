I wipe a tear away
As I give up on this day
Wonderin' if I'll ever find someone
When I close my eyes and dream
There are words I'm whispering
Someday love will come

I won't have a doubt
My head up in the clouds
And certain as the morning sun
I will always believe
There's somebody just for me
Someday love will come


[Chorus:]
Someday
After all these nights of waiting
And someday
I'll find a chance worth taking
Saving me
From wakin' up alone
My heart will find a home
Someday

And she'll be so beautiful
The sweetest miracle
Someday love will come

[Chorus]

And when I close my eyes and dream
These are the words I'm whispering
Someday love will come
Someday love will come
