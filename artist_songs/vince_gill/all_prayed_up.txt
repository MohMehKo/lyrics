[Chorus:]
I'm all prayed up
I'm ready to meet my Savior
Eternal life is waiting in the by and by
I'm all prayed up
My faith will never waiver
Heaven's doors gonna swing wide open when I die

I made my peace with Jesus a long, long time ago
Trusted in Him that He would save my soul
I walked up there beside Him
He guides me me on my way
I know He hears me when I kneel and pray

[Chorus]

Now I ain't afraid of Satan
His wicked way of sin tempted me
But he couldn't pull me in
When I've gone to live with Jesus
Face my judgment day
He'll fulfill for me the promise that He made

[Chorus]
