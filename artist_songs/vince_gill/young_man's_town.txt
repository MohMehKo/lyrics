You wake up one morning, and it's passed you by
You don't know when, and you don't know why
You feel like an old memory hangin' 'round
Man you gotta face it - it's a young man's town
You know this day was comin' all along
So why bitch and moan and say they've done you wrong
Just teach 'em what you know, and pass it on down
'Cause man, you gotta face it - it's a young man's town

[Chorus:]
It's a young man's town full of young men's dreams
And all God's children gotta learn to spread their wings
Sometimes you gotta stand back
And watch 'em burn it to the ground
Even though you built it - it's a young man's town
You always seem to be the last to know
Man, it's just the way the story goes
There's nothing you can do when the fields have turned brown
Man, you gotta face it - it's a young man's town

[Chorus]

Well, sometimes you gotta stand back
And watch 'em burn it to the ground
Even though you built it - it's a young man's town
