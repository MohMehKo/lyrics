Well hold on momma, cause papa done hit the skids
Pink slip in my pocket, how we gonna feed six kids
We’re going hinky tonkin’, I really need to tie one on
Pour me a double, bartender, keep pouring ‘till my money’s all gone

[Chorus]
I got an all nighter comin’
I got an all nighter comin’
I got an all nighter comin’
Cause I just had a long hard day

I droe a big rig diesel, I always pulled her in on time
They said, they hell with the little man, put him in the welfare line
Well, it’s a matter of time before the wolves are knocking at my door
So me and my baby, we’re headed for the ole dance floor

[Repeat Chorus]

Now don’t you worry baby cause you can’t keep a good man down
We’ll pack up everybody and find ourselves a brand new town
It takes the eighteen-wheelers to make the world turn right
We’re gonna keep on drinking and dancing in here tonight

[Repeat Chorus twice]
