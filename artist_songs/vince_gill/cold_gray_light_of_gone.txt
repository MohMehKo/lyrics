I woke up this morning long before the dawn
I stumbled to the kitchen and put some coffee on
The hose was deathly quiet, I knew something was wrong
Then suddenly it dawned on me
The cold gray light of gone

[Chorus:]
No there's nothin' quite as lonely
As the cold gray light of gone
Waking up and finding out she's never coming home
The note that said it's over
Lord it chills me to the bone
No there's nothin' quite as lonely
As the cold gray light of gone

I cried and cried for hours and I tried to clear my head
I even went and laid back down on her side of the bed
Her perfume lingered on the sheets
Our love once laid upon
Her memory's destroying me
In the cold gray light of gone

[Chorus 2x]

No there's nothin' quite as lonely
As the cold gray light of gone
