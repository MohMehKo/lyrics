I know I said I'd change for you
But I think I've changed my mind
If I can't be what you want me to
Then we're just wastin' time

[Chorus:]
Well I'm doin' the best I can
Remember I'm just a man
And if my best ain't good enough
Baby that's tough, baby that's tough

I thought love was 50/50
This just don't add up
You always take more than you give me
Is that the new math or what

Well I can bend but please don't break me
I'm just as fragile as you
You don't have to try and make me
Jump when you tell me to

[Chorus 3x]

Baby that's tough [to fade]
