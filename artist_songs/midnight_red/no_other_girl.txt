All around the world 
You sexy little fire you blazing 
There's no other girl (oh-oh)
All around the world 
Baby listen to what I am saying 

There's no other girl,that pretty face
Lights up this place, up on your face
No other (girl) that makes me see
Tonight we'll be written in history 

My hands are on my body

I'll beat it down down, down, down
Hey
My mind is on somebody
Guess what its on your body 
Lets turn it up right now 

There's No other girl all (oh-oh)

You sexy little fire you blazing 
There's no other girl (oh-oh)

There's no other girl
That's got my feet

Cause I'm your heat

That started fights
And flashing lights 
Like Vegas night

My hands are on my body

I'll beat it down down, down, down
