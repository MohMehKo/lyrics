[Thomas:]
Wait, wait
Baby I'll give you space to breathe
Tell me the truth, what did I do to make you leave
They say,
You never know what you have, till it's gone
I'm alone, baby I need you back

[Joey:]
Stop, stop
Cause I can't let you go
Whatever the cost, I'll pay it all to keep you close

[Anthony:]
Just stop,
All of the walls you built up
Because I'm not ever giving up

[Eric:]
Oh, no, no, girl
This time you won't escape, 
Can't get away from me

Oh, no, no, girl
This time I'm taking back
All that belongs to me

[All:]
Ohh oh,
I'm losing lots of control
You're the only one I want
No matter what, I'm not gon' stop
Until I get you back

Woah oh,
Until I get you back
Woah oh,
Until I get you back

Ohh oh,
No matter what, I'm not gon' stop
Until I get you back

[Anthony:]
Hold up,
I didn't mean to let you fall
Breaking your heart, leaving the scars
I did in awe

[Joey:]
This love,
Never knew what went missing it
Baby today,
Can't you see that I'm different

[Thomas:]
So now,
I'm not gon' take a chance
How would I live, what would I give
To hold your hand

Break down,
All of the walls that you built up
Because I'm not ever giving up

[Eric:]
Oh, no, no, girl
This time you won't escape, 
Can't get away from me

Oh, no, no, girl
This time I'm taking back
All that belongs to me

[All:]
Ohh oh,
I'm losing lots of control
You're the only one I want
No matter what, I'm not gon' stop
Until I get you back

Woah oh,
Until I get you back
Woah oh,
Until I get you back

Ohh oh,
No matter what, I'm not gon' stop
Until I get you back

[Eric:]
You're the only person in this world that
Means so much to me
So Ima give it all girl,
Give it all girl
All so you can see

[Colton:]
Baby, 
You're the only person in this world
Who means that much to me
So Ima give it all girl,
Give it all girl
Baby, can't you see
I'm like,

[All:]
Ohh oh,
I'm losing lots of control
You're the only one I want
No matter what, I'm not gon' stop
Until I get you back

Woah oh,
Until I get you back
Woah oh,
Until I get you back

Ohh oh,
No matter what, I'm not gon' stop
Until I get you back

Ohh oh,
I'm losing lots of control
You're the only one I want
No matter what, I'm not gon' stop
Until I get you back
