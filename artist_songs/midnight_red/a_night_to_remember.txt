And this will be a night to remember
Fire, fire when we’re heating up the block
Block, block, block.
And this will be a night to remember
All my fella’s on my lady’s burning up
Up, Up, Up.

RED ONE! 

[Thomas]
The DJ’s spinning, killer rockered’s
And the night is young
Night is young.
Yeahh.
She’s just like acid burning
On the tip of my tongue
Of my tongue.

[Eric]
And I'm letting go 
Of every fear I have,
Every fear I have.
Yeahh.
I’mma light it up like I don’t give a damn
I don't give a damn.

[Chorus - Colton]
And this will be a night to remember
Fire, fire when we’re heating up the block
Block, block, block.
And this will be a night to remember
All my fella’s on my lady’s burning up
Up, Up, Up.
Yeah throw your hands up
Throw ’em up up up up.
Fire, fire when we’re heating up the block
Block, block, block.
And this will be a night to remember
All my fella’s on my lady’s burning up
Up, Up, Up.

[Joey]
I’m feeling brand new,say the word
And I’ll go all the way
All the way.
Nothing can stop me. I’m like
I’m like a runaway train.
Runaway train.
Yeahh.

[Eric]
And I'm letting go 
Of every fear I have,
Every fear I have.
Yeahh.
I’mma light it up like I don’t give a damn
I don't give a damn.

[Chorus - Colton]
And this will be a night to remember
Fire, fire when we’re heating up the block
Block, block, block.
And this will be a night to remember
All my fella’s on my lady’s burning up
Up, Up, Up.
Yeah throw your hands up
Throw ’em up up up up.
Fire, fire when we’re heating up the block
Block, block, block.
And this will be a night to remember
All my fella’s on my lady’s burning up
Up, Up, Up.

[Anthony]
And if they shut us down,
We’ll take it to the cribe.
We’re here to party
We’re not stopping before 6AM.
And when the sun goes up
The music will be on.
[Joey]
The neighbours won’t forget
The broken bottles on the lawn.

[Chorus - Colton]
And this will be a night to remember
Fire, fire when we’re heating up the block
Block, block, block.
And this will be a night to remember
All my fella’s on my lady’s burning up
Up, Up, Up.

[Chorus]
And this will be a night to remember
Fire, fire when we’re heating up the block
Block, block, block.
And this will be a night to remember
All my fella’s on my lady’s burning up
Up, Up, Up.
Yeah throw your hands up
Throw ’em up up up up.
Fire, fire when we’re heating up the block
Block, block, block.
And this will be a night to remember
All my fella’s on my lady’s burning up
Up, Up, Up.
