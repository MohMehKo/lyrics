I think she got me 

She's got a million dollar body 
with a smile that makes you want her (want her)
I think I want her (want her)
And when she step up in the party 
Everybody's eyes are on her 
She knows they want her 

Its like I'm losing control 
I just cant help it at all
This never happened before
I swear I never let it go
Yeah I try to deny 
But now I finally realize 
When I look in her eyes 
I'm in trouble 

I think she got me 
No I cant see tonight 
I think she got me (I know she got me)
When I look in her eyes 
I think she got me (I know she got me)
I think she got me 
I, I think she got me (I know she got me)
I think she got me 
I, I think she got me (I know she got me)

She got a crazy sexy attitude that makes me want to know her 
I got know her 
And she can get with any guy she want
but I'll be Casanova 
Yeah I'ma show her

Its like I'm losing control
