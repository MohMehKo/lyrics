You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes.
Yeah, you, PMS
Like a b....
I would know
Yeah you over think
Always speak
Critically

I should know
That you're no good for me

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got the music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play (play, play, play, play)
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (hate, hate, hate, hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake (shake, shake, shake, shake)
shake it off, shake it off

I never miss a beat (never miss a beat)
I'm lightning on my feet (lightning on my feet)
But that's what they don't see, no no
That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm

I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
Make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You don't really wanna stay, no
But you don't really wanna go-o

You're hot then you're cold (shake it off, shake it off)
You're yes then you're no (I-I)
You're in then you're out (shake it off, shake it off)
You're up then you're down (I-I)

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play (cus you're hot then you're cold)
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (you're yes then you're no)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake (you're hot then you're cold)
shake it off, shake it off
