Your killing my resistance
Now I have to let go
I'm drowning in your stream girl
I could see heaven's door
I'm running out of fuse
You know I'm 'bout to explode
You're filling up my lungs
I swear I'm ready to blow

Don't leave me lonely
Leave me lonely
Leave me lonely
Put it on me
Put it on me
Put it on me

Don't keep me waitin'
This night is fading
Take me ho oh uh oh oh ome
I try but it's not the same
Give me your love again
Take me ho oh uh oh oh ome
Just want to be closer
As the night get's colder
When the music's over
Just take me home
Don't keep me waitin'
This night is fading
Take me oh oh uh oh oh ome

I'm finding myself trippin'
As I'm reaching your shore
Feeling myself ripping
But I'm asking for more
Why you hide your love from me
I'm losing control
It's so hard when you're falling
While you're climbing tall

Don't leave me lonely
Leave me lonely
Leave me lonely
Put it on me
Put it on me
Put it on me

Don't keep me waitin'
This night is fading
Take me ho oh uh oh oh ome
I try but it's not the same
Give me your love again
Take me ho oh uh oh oh ome
Just want to be closer
As the night get's colder
When the music's over
Just take me home
Don't keep me waitin'
This night is fading
Take me oh oh uh oh oh ome

Your love's so good
How can I forget
Girl your touch is still the best
You can see it all over my chest
Killing every single piece of me
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh ohh

Your love's so good
How can I forget
Girl your touch is still the best
You can see it all over my chest
Killing every single piece of me
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh ohh

Don't keep me waitin'
This night is fading
Take me ho oh uh oh oh ome
I try but it's not the same
Give me your love again
Take me ho oh uh oh oh ome
Just want to be closer
As the night get's colder
When the music's over
Just take me home
Don't keep me waitin'
This night is fading
Take me oh oh uh oh oh ome
