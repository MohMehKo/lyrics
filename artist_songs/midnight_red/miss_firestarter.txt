[Eric:]
So wild, perfect design, nothing about her is mild
Hot like the Moroccan nights, nothing can cool her down
Sparks fly when she arrives, lady’s like dynamite
Ooh my she’s about to ignite, burn the house to the ground

[Anthony:]
She cannot be tamed
I cannot behave
I cannot be saved

[Thomas:]
Cause she’s got me burning with desire
Ms. Firestarter
There she goes again, oooooh
Burning like a flame, hotter than lava
Ms. Firestarter

[Joey:]
And people might say that I’m crazy
For getting involved with this lady
But when the smoke clears I know we will be just fine
Ms Firestarter

[Colton:]
No I, I, I don’t mind being victimized
her thought drives, invading my life, 
She's more than welcome inside.
all night, no matter what time, the door's unlocked, alright. 
oh my, she's about to ignite, burn the house to the ground.

[Anthony:]
She got me burning and I can never get enough [4x]
