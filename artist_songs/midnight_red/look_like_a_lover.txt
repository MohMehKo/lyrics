I can see that, you are dancing on your own
Cause you're here, even though your friends went home
You say don't want romance but you set the whole club on fire tonight
You say you came here to dance, 
but I think somebody is lying tonight

You sure look like a lover, 
look like a lover, look like a lover to me
You sure look like a lover, 
look like a lover, look like a lover to me
Yeah, you move like a lover, 
drink like a lover, do what lovers do
You sure look like a lover, 
look like a lover, look like a lover to me

I can't hear you, but your body's talking loud
I can't wait to hear what's coming out your mouth

You say don't want romance, 
but you set the whole club on fire tonight
You say you came here to dance, 
but I think somebody's lying tonight

You sure look like a lover, 
look like a lover, look like a lover to me
You sure look like a lover, 
look like a lover, look like a lover to me
Oh, you move like a lover, 
drink like a lover, do what lovers do
You sure look like a lover, 
look like a lover, look like a lover to me

Maybe I am wrong, maybe I am wrong, but I don't think I am
Been watching you all night, watching you all night, 
you're confusing me, yeah

You say don't want romance, 
but you set the whole club on fire tonight
You say you came here to dance, 
but I get somebody's lying tonight

You sure look like a lover, look like a lover, 
look like a lover to me
You sure look like a lover, look like a lover, 
look like a lover to me
Oh, you move like a lover, drink like a lover, 
do what lovers do
You sure look like a lover, look like a lover, 
look like a lover to me
