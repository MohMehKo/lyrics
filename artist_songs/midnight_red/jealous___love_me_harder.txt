I don’t like the way he’s looking at you
I’m starting to think you want him too, yeah
Am I crazy, have I lost ya?
Even though I know you love me, can’t help it

I turn my chin music up
And I’m puffing my chest
I’m getting red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It’s not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It’s my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

So what do I do if I can't figure it out?
You got to try, try, try again, yeah.

I know your motives and you know mine
The ones that love me, I tend to leave behind
If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain

Cause if you want to keep me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder (I still get jealous)
And if you really need me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to, got to love me harder (I still get jealous) oh ohh

(ooh ooh ooh ooh love me, love me, love me)
'Cause you’re too sexy, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
(ooh ooh ooh ooh harder, harder, harder)
That’s why

So what do I do if I can't figure it out?
yeah, you got to try, try, try again
So what do I do if I can't figure it out?
I still get jealous
