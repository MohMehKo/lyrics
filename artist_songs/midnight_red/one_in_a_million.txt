I'm a movie buff, you're a sushi freak and that's okay.
You drink your coffee slow, I want mine extra hot to take away.
I jump on the bus, you prefer to walk hey that's cool.
I'm summing up the things that is separating us two.
Could it be so that god always knew?
Giving us all these chances we blew.
Making it accidentally me and you.

Now you're my one in a million, my soul companion and the universe just came through.
Who's connecting the dots, what're the odds I found you.
You're my one in a million my opinion and there's nothing we can do.
You've been searching for me, like one day I'll be there for you.
Now that you're one in a million.
(oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
You're one in a million.
(oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)

Sunday's on the coach, while I'm working out that's alright.
Cause I'm a gadget boy, you're a pretty girl not a lie.
But you know the way I think whatever makes me tik.
I'm your man.

Could it be so that god always knew?

And we're both switching lanes it's so hard to contain.
The missing piece that I have been looking for.
