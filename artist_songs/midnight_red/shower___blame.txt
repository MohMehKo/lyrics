Can't be sleepin'
Keep on waking
Without the woman next to me
Guilt is burning
Inside I'm hurting
This ain't a feeling I can keep

So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Just blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

You light me up inside
Like the 4th of July
Whenever you're around
I always seem to smile
And people ask me how
Well you're the reason why
I'm dancing in the mirror and singing in the shower (just blame it on the night)

La La Di, La La Da, La La Daaa (night, Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me)

Just blame it on the night, night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me (la la di, la la da, la la daaa)

All I want, all I need is your loving
Baby you make me hot like an oven
Since you came you know what I've discovered
Baby I don't need me another
No, no all I know
Only you got me feeling so
And you know that I got to have you
And I don't plan to let you go

Think of you when I'm going to bed
When I wake up think of you again
You are my homie, lover and friend
Exactly why

Just blame it on the night, night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me

Just blame it on the night, night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me (la la di, la la da, la la daaa)

You light me up inside
Like the 4th of July
Whenever you're around
I always seem to smile (Just blame it on the night)
And people ask me how (night)
Well you're the reason why (Don't blame it on me)
I'm dancing in the mirror (don't blame it on me)
Don't blame it on me (la la di, la la da, la la daaa)
