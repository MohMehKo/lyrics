[Thomas:]
Pictures gray and then they're gone
Still you are the one that never seems to fade
So many stars under the sun
And still you are the one that takes my breath away

[Colton:]
All the leaves will go from green to brown
That's what I've heard, all my life

[Eric:]
Baby I, I'll never let you go
You'll never dance alone
Let them say nothing lasts forever
Baby I, I'll ride the darkest storm
I'll love a little more
Let them say nothing lasts forever

[Joey:]
Cause you know you dare to roll the dice
Face the test of time
Yeah I know we will survive
Heart to heart and eye to eye
With your body close to mine
That's how we will survive

[Colton & Joey:]
All the leaves will go from green to brown
That's what I've heard, all my life

[Eric:]
Baby I, I'll never let you go
You'll never dance alone
Let them say nothing lasts forever
Baby I, I'll ride the darkest storm
I'll love a little more
Let them say nothing lasts forever

[Colton:]
Clouds of doubt
And we need to cling to hold
We're in denial.
Yeah girl that's what I've been told, all my life.

[Eric:]
Baby I, I'll never let you go
You'll never dance alone
Let them say nothing lasts forever...

[All:]
Baby I, I'll never let you
You'll never dance alone
Let them say nothing lasts forever
Baby I, I'll ride the darkest storm
I'll love a little more
Let them say nothing lasts forever

Baby I, I'll never let you
You'll never dance alone
Let them say nothing lasts forever
Baby I, I'll ride the darkest storm
I'll love a little more
Let them say nothing lasts forever...
