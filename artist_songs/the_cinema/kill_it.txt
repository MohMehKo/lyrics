Yeah, you kind of move like a freeway
Whenever you come around me
And I hope they believe this 
Cause I know you'll murder it

So we're taking all of this
Yeah, we're taking hostages 
And wasting no time in the process
I know you'll kill it

Yeah, I know we'll kill this
Let's burn it up, burn this shit up 
Try and say what you're thinking
Got to make me believe it
So, drink it up, drink it up
Cause I know you'll kill this

Lips they're painted all up red
Award show carpets
You got my eyes all stuck to this 
If we're being honest

So we're taking all of this
Yeah, we're taking hostages 
And wasting no time in the process
I know you'll kill it

Yeah, I know we'll kill this

Yeah, she just kept on murdering it
So get it up all back for the weekend
With all my new friends
We're a mess, but we're all a mess together

So take one more look at me
I better be lost in the crowd
Just one more night out	
We're lost in the crowd
Just one more night out

Yeah, I know we'll kill this
Let's burn it up, burn this shit up 
Try and say what you're thinking
Got to make me believe it
So, drink it up, yeah, drink it up
Cause I know you'll kill this

Just one more, one more night out
