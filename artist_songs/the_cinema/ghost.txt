Well I can't sleep
And in the morning when you start to breathe
I'll be falling apart at the seams
(I'm the one who can't seem to drown it out)
Now it's you that can breathe
With all the things that we used to believe
I'm finally sleeping alone next to me
(I'm the one who can't seem to drown it out)

So I'll just keep my mouth shut
Put my drink up
And float away

Been living with your ghost, but now it's faded
Guess I've got one more chance to say this
"I will never be what you want to see
You got to let it go!"
Been living with your ghost, but now it's faded
Guess I've got one more chance to say this

And I can see, as the stars in my eyes start to breathe
I'll be walking it off with my feet
(I'm the one who's shining my town)
But you couldn't be
With the boy that you couldn't believe
Was the one that could help you to breathe
(I'm the one who's shining my town)

So I'll just keep my mouth shut
Put my drink up
And float away

Been living with your ghost, but now it's faded
Guess I've got one more chance to say this
"I will never be what you want to see
You got to let it go!"
Been living with your ghost, but now it's faded
Guess I've got one more chance to say this

Yeah, picket fence on the property
Two kids, blonde hair and apple tea
But I knew it couldn't work that way
Family portrait over the fireplace
So in the words of by brother, and in the words of some others
"Gotta be careful of those lovers"
So I'll just...

Keep my mouth shut
Put my drink up
And float away

Been living with your ghost, but now it's faded
Guess I've got one more chance to say this
"I will never be what you want to see
You got to let it go!"
Been living with your ghost, but now it's faded
Guess I've got one more chance to say this
