Hey, does he draw like Picasso
When he traced your figure with his eyes
He blew it all up, blew it all up
Never thought you'd be the first one

His fur coats and fashion
I haven't been listening
Still figuring out what you are saying

Alright, so say it now, say it now
Thought I'd be the first out
Alright, say it now, say it now
How are we going down?

Does he draw like Picasso
When he traced your figure with his eyes
He blew it all up, blew it all up
Never thought you'd be the first one out
Does he draw like Picasso
When he traced your figure with his eyes
We blew it all up, blew it all up, blew it up
Now we are alive

Your words are weapons
But I couldn't stop listening
Still figuring out what you are saying

Alright, so say it now, say it now
thought I'd be the first one out
Alright, say it now, say it now
How are we going down?
I wanna see it

Does he draw like Picasso
When he traced your figure with his eyes
He blew it all up, blew it all up
Never thought you'd be the first one out
Does he draw like Picasso
When he traced your figure with his eyes
We blew it all up, blew it all up, blew it up
Now we are alive

His fur coats, his fur coats and fashion
And your words, your words are weapons
You gotta make a move now
Just try to make one point loud
Loud as you can, loud as you can
I wanna see what you're saying
Come on

He blew it all up, blew it all up
Never thought you'd be the first one out
Does he draw like Picasso
When he traced your figure with his eyes
We blew it all up, blew it all up, blew it up
Now we are alive

(Does he draw like Picasso?)

He blew it all up, blew it all up
Never thought you'd be the first one out
Does he draw like Picasso
When he traced your figure with his eyes
We blew it all up, blew it all up, blew it up
Now we are alive
