Well, you talk about the past like it hasn't happened
And you say now
I was never here, never wanted the attention
So tell me, tell me
If you ever want to be in love
If you ever want to steal a show
Then come on, then come on, then come on, then come on
There are no problems here
I guess I'll disappear

'Cause I couldn't save us
Lost in the pages
Graceful I'll fall right out that door
Cracks through the spaces
But, I couldn't save us

Come on
We're floating away
We're floating away
We're floating away
You got inside my brain
We're floating away
We're floating away
We're floating away

The story so far is whatever I say it is
And you say no
And never will be perfect, I learned this the hard way, oh
You were talking in your sleep at night
I was watching all my words collide

So come on, so come on, so come on, then come on
There are no problems here
Now it's you that disappeared

'Cause I couldn't save us
Lost in the pages
Graceful I'll fall right out that door
Cracks through the spaces
But I couldn't save us

Come on, we're floating away
We're floating away
We're floating away
You got inside my brain
We're floating away
We're floating away
We're floating away

Yeah, it can be amazing
When people see that cheesy laugh, yeah it's crazy
When you go, when you go, when you go, when you go
I should be the first to know
Spend your life the best ways
Searching for someone out in a new place
But here we are, here we are, here we are, here we are
Yeah, right back where we were

'Cause I couldn't save us
Lost in the pages
Graceful we'll fall right out that door
Cracks through the spaces
But I couldn't save us

Come on, we're floating away
We're floating away
We're floating away
You got inside my brain
We're floating away
We're floating away
We're floating away
