Cut the cord that opens up my jaw
As all these words run, I'm out of breath from kicking cans at God

And I said, Jesus Christ
The nights are much too long
I'm tired of throwing bodies at the moon
I’m sure I will be caught soon

And then I had this dream I was fast as lightning
Flying in a suitcase over these islands
But this time I did, I'm not waking up

Get it right this time
I’m throwing lassos at the sky
Catching moments as big as my eyes
Intoxicating like, like we’re on a gold mine

Get it right this time
I'm throwing islands at your eyes
That’s right you got me practicing lies
Intoxicating like, like we’re on a gold mine

Cut the curtains fall around my head
Yesterday is dead, I can’t erase the stupid things I did

And I said Jesus Christ
The nights are much too strong
I’m tired of throwing bottles at the sun
I’m sure we won’t be here long 

And then I had this dream I was fast as lightning
Flying in a suitcase over these islands
But this time I did, I’m not waking up

Get it right this time
I'm throwing lassos at the sky
Catching moments as big as my eyes
Intoxicating like, like we’re on a gold mine

Get it right this time
I'm throwing islands at your eyes
That’s right you got me practicing lies
Intoxicating like

And maybe I’ve been thinking about the molecules I’ve been breathing
And now my skin’s so soft it breaks with every breath I’m taking
And now my blood is full of airplanes and they’re flying me away
From all these God damn dirt bag neighborhoods
Saying don’t look back, don’t you dare look back at me

Alright this time
We’re throwing models at the sun
Won’t be here for too long
Intoxicating like, intoxicating

Get it right this time
I’m throwing islands at your eyes
That’s right you got me practicing lies
Intoxicating like, like, like

Get it right this time
I’m throwing lassos at the sky
Catching moments as big as my eyes
Intoxicating like
Don’t look back, don’t you dare look back now

Get it right this time
I’m throwing islands at your eyes
That’s right you got me practicing lies
Intoxicating like, like we're on a gold mine
