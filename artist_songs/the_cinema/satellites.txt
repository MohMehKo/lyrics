Ok, you fell asleep in the pouring rain
So I gathered up your lips to say
You got it good kid, got that movement
Well don't throw it away
Well I once was a mess too
But she saw through, and I know you
Got this in your blood, dear
For years and years and years

Killin' time in the best ways
So c'mon and join me
Saturday was never the same without your name

The satellites were glowing
At least we were hoping
Yeah the satellites are glowing
Well just for the moment
Yeah you stole it

Saw your face, and the words just came
Yeah, I blame that bottle
I blame this bar stool
I think I got what you need from me
So let's take it week by week by week
Well I once was a mess too
But she saw through, and I know you
You got this in your blood, dear
For years and years
Killin' time in the best ways
So c'mon and join me
Saturday was never the same without your name

The satellites were glowing
At least we were hoping
Yeah the satellites are glowing
Well just for the moment
Yeah you stole it

I think I'd make it out if I was older so I told her
One more for the road, one more yeah
But she knows me better
I think we'll make it out when we get older but I know her
Making bets, making bets in her head, poker
She must be a model
Now I think we're having fun, bottles
Got all the time in the world
Yeah so wipe that look off your face girl

The satellites were glowing
Killin' time in the best ways
So c'mon and join me
Saturday was never the same without your name

The satellites were glowing
At least we were hoping
Yeah the satellites are glowing
Well just for the moment
Yeah you stole it

(I think we'll make it out when we get older)
The satellites were glowing
(Make a bet, make a bet)
Well just for the moment
Yeah, you stole it
