We drove until we both ran out of fame
Like tiny box car playgrounds on a train
We talked until our mouths turned into shapes that we could frame
So we stayed
We said I'd like to buy a crown and sail the world
I said I'd like to have it all but would it hurt?
To open up your eyes and find there's nothing left to burn
So we burn
It's gonna be paradise
We'll just get lost in the lights
So call it in the air this time
That's why we're caught up in the cloud
Call it in the air
It's gonna be paradise
We'll just get lost in the lights
Till we get it right
Call it in the air this time
That's why we're caught up in the cloud

And there's a girl, let's call her Virginia
I spoke about her like I really missed her
And every week it passed I found answers in my flask and tried to pretend
What a beautiful night that really was
But drove a few more hours just because
And everyone was there drinking in their frozen chairs
We got nowhere we need to go
It's gonna be paradise
We'll just get lost in the lights
So call it in the air this time
That's why we're caught up in the crowd
Call it in the air
It's gonna be paradise
We'll just get lost in the lights
Till we get it right
Call it in the air this time
That's why we're caught up in the crowd
Call it in the air
I got some secrets in my basement
I've got some skeletons I haven't seen in ages
I just keep my words close breathing real slow
As I try to watch how this whole story goes
Cuz now it stops there
It's gonna be paradise
We'll just get lost in the lights
It's gonna be paradise
We'll just get lost in the lights
So call it in the air this time
Cuz now we're caught up in the crowd
Call it in the air
It's gonna be paradise
We'll just get lost in the lights
Until we get it right
Call it in the air this time
That's why we're caught up in the crowd
Call it in the air
