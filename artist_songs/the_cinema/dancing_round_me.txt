The best things come as you look away
Been trying to tell you they're all insane
'Cause I don't got too much to say
I'm savin' up my words, ok?
Trying to figure out what it's like
You don't know how and you don't know why
Sick and I'll go away so tell me all the words you say

Well suddenly it's raining as she's saying
"I don't ever wanna leave this place"
Lookin' at her laying on the pavement
I'll remember this day
We got it now

No clothes on, we sold out
Yeah, right where I need to be
Dancing 'round me, she's moving my feet
No problems
All them as far as I've ever seen
Dancing 'round me, she's moving my feet

Coming on quick
Yeah, you're moving fast
Telling me the world is not so bad
Now I got too much to say
It's coming through my skin and veins
Beating yourself up all summer long
Spit it right back if it tastes too strong

Sick and I'll go away so tell me all the words you say
'Cause I can never change it, I still taste it, I love this taste
She's laughing and wasted yeah just say it
I'm gonna miss this place

And no clothes on, and we sold out
Yeah right where I need to be
Dancing 'round me, she's moving my feet
No problems, all them as far as I've ever seen
Dancing round me, she's moving my feet

Well suddenly it's raining as she's saying
"I don't ever wanna leave this place"
Lookin' at her laying on that pavement
I'll remember this day

No clothes on
We sold out
No problems
All them
'Cause we got it now

And no clothes on, and we sold out
Yeah right where I need to be
Dancing 'round me, she's moving my feet
No problems, all them as far as I've ever seen
Dancing round me, she's moving my feet
