I've been talking just to hear my voice 'cause
I've been hearing just enough to make me wonder
Stealin' lines to shine in the pavement
Look away 'cause I swear I'd fake it forever
Weak in the knees, how can I hold it together when I cannot sleep at night?
Got a feeling that I won't stop
Stuck in the tree tops
I've been here forever
But I can not walk away
From the bridges that I can't cross
Burning them away

Oh no, I did, I said everything I wanted to say
But we never really made it to the punch line
Yet we spent the night setting up our whole lives
Oh no, I did, I said everything I wanted to say
But we never really made it to the punchline
Shooting bullets at the moon just to pass time
Oh no
But we'll never really make it to, make it to the punchline

What'd I get myself into now?
These words bounce around the whole house
But I've seen that look a few times
When you're here pressed up against me, alright
Yeah, weak in the knees, can't pull it together
So I just close my eyes and watch
All the shit in my own head
And with your feet on the ground yelling out something loud
When you ever going to find me?
Yeah, we'll find out some day, won't we?

Oh no, I did, I said everything I wanted to say
But we never really made it to the punchline
Yet we spent the night setting up our whole lives
Oh no, I did, I said everything I wanted to say
But we never really made it to the punchline
Shooting bullets at the moon just to pass time
But we'll never really make it to, make it to the punchline

Tell me that you want to start believing
Every breath alone I can't believe I'm leaving
Living the days like we're golden
Taking it all like you stole it
Save it for the morning when you find the sky
Take it to the covers, we won't sleep tonight
Covered your eyes so you look surprised
Running away from those city lights

Oh no, I did, I said everything I wanted to say
But we never really made it to the punchline
Yet we spent the night setting up our whole lives
Oh no, I did, I said everything I wanted to say
But we never really made it to the punchline
Shooting bullets at the moon just to pass time

Oh no, I did, I said everything I wanted to say
But we never really made it to the punchline
Yet we spent the night setting up our whole lives
Oh no, I did, I said everything I wanted to say
But we never really made it to the punchline
Yeah we'll never really made it to, made it to
