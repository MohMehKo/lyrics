(Oh shit)
You're talking way to slow
You're talking way to slow, kid
Let's run our mouths till they're broken

You're talking awfully slow
You're talking way to slow, dear
Just close your mouth, and know this

It's just the way I think
Guess it's the way I speak (yeah)
Let's make a toast, for all those

All those flashing lights, they couldn't face me right
(she could, she could)
All of those flashing lights, they never faced me right
(she could, she could)

I couldn't hope for more, I couldn't hope for more
Cause now she's standing at my door
I think I got this right
I finally got one right
For the first time in my life

It's just the way I think
Guess it's the way I speak (yeah)
Let's make a toast, for all those

All those flashing lights, they couldn't face me right
(she could, she could)
All of those flashing lights, they never faced me right
(she could, she could)
I guess those city lights never burned as bright
(she could, she could)
All of those flashing lights, they never faced me right
(she could, she could)

So now I'm the one with the problem
Too many words in my mouth, handgun
Let's hope that she's got some value
I'm talking dollars, I'm talking decimals
But tonight she's right by my side
Guess it feels right
We'll run our mouths, run our mouths, all night

All those flashing lights, they couldn't face me right
(she could, she could)
All of those flashing lights, they never faced me right
(she could, she could)
I guess those city lights never burned as bright
(she could, she could)
All of those flashing lights, they never faced me right
(she could, she could)
