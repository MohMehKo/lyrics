Way back, way back in the day
I swear, we were so good at wasting time in every way
And way back, way back in the day
Yeah, I used to say anything to try and move your face
But we, we are breathing, we are dreaming,
So you take the monsters, and I'll take the demons

I can only hope I am living the right life
With your heart beating against me
If you're going down, then I'm going down
We will burn
We're living the right life
With your heart beating against me
If you're going down, then I'm going down

We're in bed, in bed recovering,
We're not going outside, yeah, until the evening
In bed, I see you stumbling
I'm laughing, loving it all as you fall asleep again
But now they are breathing, but they're bleeding
So, I'll take the monsters, if you can take my demons

Yeah, I can only hope I'm living the right way
With your heart beating against me
If you're going down, then I'm going down
We will blend
We living the right way with your heart beating against me,
If you're going down, then I'm going down

Way back, (way back) way back in the day
I swear, we were so good at wasting time in every way
Way back, (way back) way back in the day
We are breathing, we are dreaming
We were so good
You'll take the monsters, and I'll take the demons

Yeah I can only hope I'm living the right way
With your heart beating against me
If you're going down, then I'm going down
Yeah, I can only hope I'm living the right way
With your heart beating against me
If you're going down, then I'm going down
We will blend
Livin' the right way
With your heart beating against me
If you're going down, then I'm going down
Way back (way back), way back in the day
If you're going down, (way back, way back in the day) then I'm going down
