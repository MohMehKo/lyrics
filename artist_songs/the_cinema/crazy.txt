Cr-cr-craazzyy
Woaah
Cr-cr-craazzyy
Woaah
So, I've got my wings and I was
Just tryin to float away from
Wherever we used to go
You got me so
You're tryin to capture it
But I know I never forget
Cause now you got me alone
I was sold
But I can't hide it anymore

All I see
Is another crazy
All I need
Is someone who's tryin to save me
Cr-cr-crazzy
Cr-cr-craazy
But I don't want it baby

I won't tell if you don't ask
Just watchin the waves as they crash
I never thought I would go
But now I know
Wouldn't trade it for the world
For the king's golden pearls
Now that you got me alone
Yeah, I'm sold
I won't fight it anymore

All I see
Is another crazy
All I need
Is someone who's tryin to save me
Cr-cr-crazzy
Cr-cr-craazy
But I don't want it baby
Cr-cr-crazzy
Cr-cr-craazy
But I don't want it baby

So wave my head in the sky
That crazy look in your eye
I'm just sayin, you got me, you got me, you got me
Got me a little bit scared
Tellin me to beware
But I forget as she's taken on my soul
Yes be with it

All I see
Is another crazy
All I need
Is someone who's tryin to save me
All I see
Is another crazy
All I need
Is someone who's tryin to save me
Cr-cr-crazzy
Cr-cr-craazy
But I don't want it baby
Cr-cr-crazzy
Cr-cr-craazy
But I don't want it baby
Cr-cr-crazzy
Cr-cr-craazy
But I don't want it baby
