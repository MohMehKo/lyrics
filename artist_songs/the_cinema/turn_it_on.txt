Turn, turn it (turn, turn it)
Won't you turn, turn it on (turn, turn it on)
When the sun comes up I'm gone

There's two pupils staring right at me
She's telling me I am crazy
But I love that look, that look you're givin' me
Blue jeans, hair tied up, yeah
She knows exactly what I love most (what I love most)

And it was always the long drives, the short nights, the thin ice
That kept me hanging on
'Cause when the sun comes up I'm gone
We're buried in the bright lights, the dark eyes
The camera lens and city lights (city lights)
So turn it on (so turn it)

Turn, turn it (turn, turn it)
Won't you turn, turn it on (turn, turn it on)
When the sun comes up (up, the sun comes up)
Turn, turn it (turn, turn it)
Won't you turn, turn it on (turn it on)
When the sun comes up I'm gone

She's got two of her bags in the doorway
There's something I really should say
Before I miss my opportunity
Well I hope you never are lonely
And she just says, "I am happy" (says I am happy)

And it was always the long drives, the short nights, the thin ice
That kept me hanging on
'Cause when the sun comes up I'm gone
We're buried in the bright lights, the dark eyes
The camera lens and the city lights (city lights)
So turn it on

Turn, turn it (turn, turn it)
Won't you turn, turn it on (turn, turn it on)
When the sun comes up (up, the sun comes up)
Turn, turn it (turn, turn it)
Won't you turn, turn it on (turn, turn it on)
When the sun comes up I'm gone

And I stopped thinking about
All the people, all the places, all the shit I'll never know
So before I see you on the other side

It's always the long drives, the short nights, it's the thin ice
That kept me hanging on
'Cause when the sun comes up I'm gone
We're buried in the bright lights, the dark eyes
The camera lens and the city lights (city lights)
So turn it on (so turn it)

Turn, turn it (turn, turn it)
Won't you turn, turn it on (turn, turn it on)
When the sun comes up (up, the sun comes up)
Turn, turn it (turn, turn it)
Won't you turn, turn it on (turn, turn it on)
When the sun comes up I'm gone
