I knew it right from the start
You were breakin' through my bones tryin' to get my heart
And when I have to go away
I can only hope that you won't forget me

And she knows, 'cause she's breathin' and she needs it
Got me up against the wall
And she's breathin', 'cause she needs it
Oh I try not to even think about it

It's the way you're pressing your lips up against me (me, me)
And it's the way you're putting your hands on my body
You're taking a part of me (yeah, yeah)
And this place, this girl, it's me
Yeah why am I even wondering (yeah, yeah)
And this time it's fine that she's taking a part of me

In the pursuit of happiness
And I would really love it if you could just come with
The dark days are all behind us
And this is me just being honest

And she knows, 'cause she's breathin', 'cause she needs it
Swimmin' underneath the stars
And she's breathin' cause she needs it
Oh I try not to even think about it

It's the way you're pressing your lips up against me (me, me)
And it's the way you're putting your hands on my body
You're taking a part of me (yeah, yeah)
And this place, this girl, it's me
Yeah why am I even wondering (yeah, yeah)
And this time it's fine that she's taking a part of me

Ohhhh Ohhhh Ohhhhh
Ohhhh Ohhhh Ohhhhh
She said "Promise me anything"
Lie to me, tell me you got a ring"
'Cause tonight (tonight), tonight (tonight)
We don't need that jewelry
Don't need a damn thing

It's the way you're pressing your lips up against me (me, me)
And it's the way you're putting your hands on my body
You're taking a part of me, (yeah, yeah)
And this place, this girl, it's me
Yeah why am I even wondering (yeah, yeah)
And this time it's fine that she's take-take-take

It's the way you're pressing your lips up against me (me, me)
And it's the way you're putting your hands on my body
You're taking a part of me (yeah, yeah)
And this place, this girl, it's me
Yeah why am I even wondering (yeah, yeah)
And this time it's fine that she's taking a part of me
