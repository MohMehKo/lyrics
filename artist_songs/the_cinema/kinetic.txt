We slowed it down, now we're savin' the city
We'll be up in all our palm trees, drinking
So we'll speak our words and sit on top of the profits
Go take some notes kid and come back in the evening

Yeah, where we wanna be now
It's where we thought we'd be safe and sound, back on the ground
You can't fight the motion, it's kinetic
You can't stop the moment, it's electric, I can't forget it

We're holding down what was left of the city
I could use one more hour, driving this freeway
So we'll speak our words and sit on top of the profits
Go take some notes kid, and come back when it's settled in

Yeah, where we wanna be now
It's where we thought we'd be safe and sound, back on the ground
You can't fight the motion, it's kinetic
You can't stop the moment, it's electric, I can't forget it

Yeah, where we wanna be now
Yeah, it's where we thought we'd be safe and sound
Yeah, where we wanna be now
Where we thought we'd be safe and sound, on the ground
You can't fight the motion, it's kinetic
You can't stop the moment, it's electric, I can't forget it

You can't fight the motion, it's kinetic
(yeah, where we wanna be now)
You can't stop the moment, it's electric, I can't forget it
(where we thought we'd be safe and sound, back on the ground)
It's electric, I can't forget it
It's electric, electric, I can't forget it
