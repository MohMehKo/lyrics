So I don't know why but I love this
Yeah, my bones here in my sockets
'Cause you really wanna watch everything
From the air, from the air
Yeah and we still got half our minds here

So we're chasing it down again
Figuring out why the world's still spinning

Oh oh ohhhh
Oh, I saw you coming alive
Yeah, I saw that look in your eyes
Oh oh ohhhhh
I wanna see you run wild
Yeah, I want that crooked smile

So what do you do when you miss me?
So miss, watch and feel and just be
'Cause I was lost in all of that light
Pouring through, tellin' you
I'm never sure I just can't do (I do)

Chasing it down again
Figuring out why the world's still spinning

Oh oh ohhhh
Oh, I saw you coming alive
Yeah, I saw that look in your eyes
Oh oh ohhhhh
Woah, I wanna see you run wild
Yeah, I want that crooked smile

'Cause me breaking hearts
See a few bones on top of me
Was telling you all my regrets
But I bet that you were breaking hearts
See your bones on top of me
She said "I never want any regrets"
Well hell yes

Oh oh ohhhh
Oh, I saw you coming alive
Yeah, I saw that look in your eyes
Oh oh ohhhhh
Woah, I wanna see you run wild
Yeah, I want that crooked smile

Oh oh ohhhh
Oh, I saw you coming alive
Yeah, I saw that look in your eyes
Oh oh ohhhhh
Woah, I wanna see you run wild
Yeah, I want that crooked smile
