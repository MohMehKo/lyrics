Money ain't a problem
So yeah, we're gone darling
And your words are not tough
While we sleeping off on weekdays
Oh I got you back here
Lets take it to the pavement
Hell, lets throw our eyes at the ocean
I told them
We're never coming back

Cause she's on my arm now
And we're burning shit down
So take what you need out
And take it all
Cause everyone believes
In what they cannot see
But if that makes you happy
Then we can wake up

Happy for you, you were
Happy for you

I think we'll be fine here
So lets take the next year
Just to try out
Lets drink some whiskey
Let's go to Mexico
Let's throw our eyes at the ocean
I told them
We're never coming back here

Cause she's on my arm now
And we're burning shit down
So take what you need out
And take it all
Cause everyone believes
In what they cannot see
But if that makes you happy
Then we can wake up

Happy for you were
Happy for you
You got you and your girl and
I got me and my world here
So come on take a bow
Cause you made it
Fuck that you are the greatest
I swear you'll be famous
In pages
All those pages

Cause she's on my arm now
And we're burning shit down
So take what you need out
And take it all
Cause everyone believes
In what they cannot see
But if that makes you happy
Then we can wake up

Cause she's on my arm now
We're burning it all down
So take what you need out
And take it all
Cause everyone believes
In what they cannot see
But this makes you happy
Then we can wake up
Happy for you were
Happy for you
Then we can wake up
Happy for you
