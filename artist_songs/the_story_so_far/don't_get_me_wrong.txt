I'm getting closer and I don't know what to do.
My bed's still messed up and my clothes still smell like you
We'll go together through this town we'll walk,
But recently, the only deep thing is your song.
I know it hurts to be alone
But all this shows is you haven't grown
Still look at me I'll watch you stare
Those feelings are gone so see if I care
Survive the worst and make the best
You deserve nothing less than being worthless,
Your priorities are such a mess
You're so far away from being selfless
Stop looking through me and start looking at me
Are you done talking?
Because this is exactly what I need just to make it through
Drive away in your car and I'll just forget you
I know it hurts to be alone
But all this shows is you haven't grown
Still look at me I'll watch you stare
Those feelings are gone so see if I care
Survive the worst and make the best
You reserve nothing less than being worthless,
Your priorities are such a mess
You're so far away from being selfless.
Don't get me wrong.
