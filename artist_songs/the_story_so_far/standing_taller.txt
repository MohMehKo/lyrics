Life is but a song I'm playing, Listen to the words I'm singing
Songs will never play forever, but the melodies will follow out

Can you hear my words? 
Break down the walls that bury yours
Can you hear my words?
They were the last you should have heard

I used to not stand my ground, but I'm standing taller now
I will steer this ship to safety, I've been nostalgic lately

Can you hear my words? 
Break down the walls that bury yours
Can you hear my words?
They were the last you should have heard

Can you hear my words? (Can you hear my words?)
Break down the walls that bury yours
Can you hear my words? (Can you hear my words?)
They were the last you should have heard
