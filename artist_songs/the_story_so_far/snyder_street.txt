We walked through Arbo at 2 AM last night
For lack of a better idea to pass the time
Our eyes were heavy but our hearts felt light
We chopped the tree to the ground
And broke the silence with sight

Cause we saw the sky in a darker shade of blue
And we wasted gas guided by the moon

Got lost in this free world, remembered who we were
And it brought us back to where we are now
Got lost in this free world, remembered who we were
And it brought us back to where we are now

Tucked back in south wiget lane
My thoughts drowned out by the rain
And if you've got time then I'll explain
How I still feel the same
Cause I've got questions and suggestions
To break out of this cage
A 17 chapter long story of my struggle with age
Still writing

Cause we saw the sky in a darker shade of blue
And we wasted gas guided by the moon

Got lost in this free world, remembered who we were
And it brought us back to where we are now
Got lost in this free world, remembered who we were
And it brought us back to where we are now

Cause you're still my friends

Remember Snyder street I think I'm losing sleep
Over this (roll over in my bed)
The crazy high's we'd reach I don't think I'll ever
Forget this (even if I'm dead)
Remember Snyder street I think I'm losing sleep
Over this (roll over in my bed)
The crazy high's we'd reach I don't think I'll ever
Forget this (even if I'm dead)

Roll over in my bed
Even if I'm dead
Roll over, fall asleep again.
