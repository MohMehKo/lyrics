I try to rise and fall with sun
But lately, it doesn't make any sense to me
Walking by myself trap the silence in the hall
And I can feel the pressure in my head
I'm the book you always opened but you never read.
Beside the box you call your bed

It's your fault I'd say
I let this blind me
Forlorn in sullen head
Suffer your ill intent

Watch your mind ignore
Just like all those times before
That's the way it is
And I won't write you back anymore
There's better faces
To fill all the spaces
Left by the masks you wore

It's your fault I'd say
I let this blind me
Forlorn in sullen head
Suffer your ill intent

Maybe that's the reason I was never enough
Cause all I do is chalk it up to bad luck
Unfinished business has me stuck
Bad luck
Bad luck
