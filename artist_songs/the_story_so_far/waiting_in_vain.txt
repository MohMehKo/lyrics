I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
From the very first time I rest my eyes on you, girl
My heart says follow through

But I know now that I'm way down on your line
But the waiting feel is fine
So don't treat me like a puppet on a string
‘Cause I know I have to do my thing

Don't talk to me as if you think I'm dumb
I wanna know when you're gonna come

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love

‘Cause if summer is here
I'm still waiting there
Winter is here
I'm still waiting there

Like I said
It's been three years since I'm knocking on your door
And I still can knock some more
Oh girl, oh girl, is it feasible?
I wanna know now, for I to knock some more

You see, in life I know there's lots of grief
But your love is my relief
Tears in my eyes burn, tears in my eyes burn
While I'm waiting, while I'm waiting for my turn

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love, oh
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna wait in vain
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna wait in vain
