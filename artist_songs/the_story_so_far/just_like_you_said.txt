I'd say this more but I'm feeling troubled today
I'm stuck, my mind has been sinking for miles
I'm losing touch with my old friend
Next time my finger slips I've gotta learn to grip this
Till it hurts

This time is taking away from a stable heart
A year ago anxiety kept me away
But we've been over that, we'll make this better than before

I know that's not your smile but you still seem to wear it
You always meant a lot I never meant to be absent
We both know leaving does nothing to cure it
But regardless of the truth I never said that I liked it
THIS SONG IS SICK WITH HOPE

My time is wrapping up with you
It slips away with everything you say and do
I've said all I've said and I'm trying
To say the words that mean the most
I'm gonna leave them here to settle before I become
A ghost

This time is taking away from a stable heart
3 weeks to go on Saturday I move away
But we've been over that
We'll make this better than before

I've been driving and I've been listening
To the song that you left in my head
You'll always be there for me
Just like a friend, just like you said

Don't say I've wasted your time here with bad news
Don't say you'll leave me the way that I found you
(I used to lie awake and stare at)
Don't say
(Ceilings thinking of the air)
I've wasted
(You fill your lungs with)
Your time here with bad news
(I used to lie awake and stare at)
Don't say
(Ceilings thinking of the air)
You'll leave me
(You fill your lungs with)
The way that I found you.
