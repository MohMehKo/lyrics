Count me out of tradition, I think it's time for a change of style
Picking up where we left off, so come on in and stay a while
Reasons keep me from the truth, and push me farther away from you
Why do you act the way you do, to make a mess to fix with glue

I know that things fell short of what you wanted and more
So take the last bus home and keep the change, we're set in stone
So take the last bus home and keep the change, we're set in stone

This music is what I did choose, right here right now it's all I'll do
Give me time and I will prove that I am here for all of you
Reasons keep me from the truth, and push me farther away from you
Why do you act the way you do, to make a mess to fix with glue

I know that things fell short of what you wanted and more
So take the last bus home and keep the change, we're set in stone
So take the last bus home and keep the change, we're set in stone

I know that things fell short of what you wanted and more
So take the last bus home and keep the change, we're set in stone
So take the last bus home and keep the change, we're set in stone
