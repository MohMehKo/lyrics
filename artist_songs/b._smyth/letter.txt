Yea yea, yea yea

You're the apple of my eye, nah ion like that
You're the wheels to my ride, keeps me goin'
Yea I know that she ain't heard nothing like this
You're my moon in the night, you be glowing
There ain't a better feeling whenever we kiss

There's so many things I wanna say
But I lose the words when I see your face
They say writing letters is so old fashioned
But this is the best way to describe my affection

I'm writing you this letter
No text, no email, something real, something you can feel
I'm writing you this letter
Of all the reasons I think we should be together

And Ima sit down with this pen and make a list
Of all the things I think you should know
Even though they don't do this no mo'
Cause you're worth it I'm writing you this letter
And once I ink it you can keep this thing forever, this letter

And you're the air that I breathe, the words that I speak
Cause without you, baby what I do it wouldn't mean a thing
You're the J's on my feet, jeans and my tee
And without you by my side, I just wouldn't look right

There's so many things I wanna say 
But I lose the words when I see your face
They say writing letters is so old fashioned
But this is the best way to describe my affection

I'm writing you this letter
No text, no email, something real, something you can feel
I'm writing you this letter
Of all the reasons I think we should be together

And Ima sit down with this pen and make a list
Of all the things I think you should know
Even though they don't do this no mo'
Cause you're worth it I'm writing you this letter
And once I ink it you can keep this thing forever, this letter

And the things it would say if my heart would speak
Finna write down all my feelings like a diary
And girl my loves an open book and now it's yours to keep
I write it down girl so you can see 
Ohhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhh
Ima sit down with this pen and write this letter, this letttterr

I'm writing you this letter (letttteeeerrrr) 
No text, no email, something real, something you can feel
I'm writing you this letter
Of all the reasons reasons I think we should be together

And Ima sit down with this pen and make a list
Of the things I think you should know 
Even though they don't do this no mo'
Cause you're it I'm writing you this letter
And once I ink it you can keep this thing forever

Baby girl I'm writing you this letttteeerrr
