Oh (sexy) oh oh oooh
(you so...sexy) oh oh oh
Oh oh oh (tonight baby) ooooh

[Hook:]
I'm gettin' that
I'm gettin' that
I'm gettin' that
I'm gettin' that love

Her mama's a thoroughbred, it's obvious
And the way that shawty swag in the room, you can tell it was taught to her
She was cold as a frost bite
Sharp as a broken window pane
And I just couldn't resist this girl's ambiance
Had to know her name
She had her Kobe game
So finesse, full of taste
Filled with a Michael
Pivot
She in my 4-58
All white cockpit
Head where the zip is
What else can I say?

[Hook 2x]

She's whispering, she's been waiting for this in
In my ear
We on that inner state
I can't concentrate, cause the way she feel
(let me pull over. I just gotta pull over)
Pull 'em over to the side, so you can really enjoy the ride
I just need to know you're prepared for this unruly love
Cause you know I be on my B. Brown, '89
For real though

[Hook 2x]

It took so long to get us two, in a room
You already know what I wanna do to
You
I'm offering to take it off first
Now you
Let the violins play
While I take off your lace
Look at your face
While
I'm

[Hook 2x]
