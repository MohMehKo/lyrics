Hold up girl just wind it slow
Hold up girl just wind it slow
Hold up girl just wind it slow
Hold up girl

She's a twerkaholic
She's a twerkaholic
She's a twerkaholic
She needs me to get her started
My love is gonna get her faded
She said my love is so intoxicating

Ride, ride, ride my loving baby
Ride my loving don't stop, baby [x2]

If you stay with me all through this verse
I'll be your designated driver girl
I wanna take you home
Straight to the bed let's skip the pillow talk
I know that I deserve you
Baby show me what that twerk do
Baby show me what that twerk do
Show me how you work you too oooh

Imma take you where you're tryna go
She gon' need rehab for sure
Cos everywhere that she go
Hold up lemme clear my throat

She's a twerkaholic
She's a twerkaholic
She's a twerkaholic
She needs me to get her started
My love is gonna get her faded
She said my love is so intoxicating

Ride, ride, ride my loving baby
Ride my loving don't stop, baby [x2]
