When we started out it was all good
Thought we were in love
Thought you were the one for me
But then you switched out and changed up
What the hell went wrong?
Now I'm singing this song, can't believe it
I gave you everything you could ask for
But it wasn't enough, you wanted more
How could you be so cold, girl, how could you be so cold?
Tricking off on me, all the homies told me you was wrong
Now you can be gone, get to leaving 

'Cause all of this was for you but you took my love and drove
It all, it all away but it's, but it's ok 
Got somebody else to take your place

I'm in my goochi zone, zone 
Girl, I ain't tripping, I'mma do my thing
I'm in my goochi zone, zone 
I'm turnt up by 100 degrees
I'm good, I'm goochi 
I'm good, I'm goochi 
I'm good, I'm goochi 
I'm good, I'm goochi 
I'm in my goochi zone, zone 
Hands up if you rolling with me

I'm on now, moved on, not the tables turn
Now she all concerned with me
Yeah, but it's too late, I'm long gone
Ain't looking back, she a thing of the past, I don't need it

'Cause all of this was for you but you took my love and drove
It all, it all away but it's, but it's ok 
Got somebody else to take your place

I'm in my goochi zone, zone 
Girl, I ain't tripping, I'mma do my thing
I'm in my goochi zone, zone 
I'm turnt up by 100 degrees
I'm good, I'm goochi 
I'm good, I'm goochi 
I'm good, I'm goochi 
I'm good, I'm goochi 
I'm in my goochi zone, zone 
Hands up if you rolling with me

I'm on my own, doing my thing
All these women in my lane
See, I tried to love you, baby
But you played me, it's a shame
I'm on my own, doing my thing
All these women in my lane
See, I tried to love you, baby
But you played me, it's a shame

I'm in my goochi zone, zone 
Girl, I ain't tripping, I'mma do my thing
I'm in my goochi zone, zone 
I'm turnt up by 100 degrees
I'm good, I'm goochi 
I'm good, I'm goochi 
I'm good, I'm goochi 
I'm good, I'm goochi 
I'm in my goochi zone, zone 
Hands up if you rolling with me

I'm in my goochi zone, zone 
I'm good, I'm goochi 
I'm good, I'm goochi 
I'm good, I'm goochi 
I'm good, I'm goochi 
I'm in my goochi zone, zone
