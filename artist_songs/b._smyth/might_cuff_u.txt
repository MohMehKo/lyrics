She let me touch her, so I ask her how it feel
She say she love it, but she wanna ride for real
So I let her ride for real
Goin' deep, givin' her chills
You can have whatever you want in this moment babe
I treat you right, yeah
Just bring that body to me 'cause I know you want it babe
I'm a take my time

Want you to remember that
So don't hold back, you feelin' that
When I put it in, you gon' want some more of that
When we fuck and we tryna get serious
Holdin' on tight like girl, get rid of it
Shawty so makes me so real of this
Call my line, you can't get enough, no
Just might cuff you, might cuff you

I don't wanna be the one to lead you on
But I might be the guy that's on your phone
Like, "Baby, where you at? What you doin'? Can you come by?"
This money got me tunnel vision, I'm just out here tryna live life
I just might cuff you baby, love seems so overrated
I'll be the first to say it, I can't do no fakin'
I just might cuff you baby, love seems so overrated

Baby girl, you can get cuffed by the Balmain dentals
Can't be sad when you dealin' with a Parkway nigga
Every nigga you see round me, I came a long way with 'em
I just gotta put a roll, I'm a pull up on you just because you full
Tryna lock you down like a jail, my bedroom is a cell
Feelin' on your booty like Kells, 500 dollars on smell
Fine as tonight in Chanel, nah nigga I don't resell
Kill the pussy, I'm a make bail, call me when your man ain't there, yeah

Want you to remember that
So don't hold back, you feelin' that
When I put it in, you gon' want some more of that
When we fuck and we tryna get serious
Holdin' on tight like girl, get rid of it
Shawty so makes me so real of this
Call my line, you can't get enough, no
Just might cuff you, might cuff you

Don't be actin' shy up in this room
Like I make you nervous, oh
