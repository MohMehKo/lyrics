Came home last night, lost my mind
And the world felt twice the size
And my head felt like it didn't belong to me

Now SOS, I'm lost at sea
Let the water just take me
And what happens now?
Cause nothing seems clear anymore

Does the feeling come to you?
Cause it's hitting on me too
Is it love or are we just falling too soon?

Whatever happens, I don't care
Cause I know what you're giving me
You're giving me, honey

Somebody love me now
Cause my feet don't hit the ground
And I need some helping out
Cause I had it all before but now it really don't matter

Please darling, take me down
Cause I'm lost inside a crowd
Take me home safe and sound
Cause I had it all before but now it really don't matter anymore

Red eyes, lows, highs, in my life
It just turned into a ride
Keeps going 'round

And I can't get off of it
Settle down, don't make a sound
Cause you're losing yourself now
Then when you're outta time

Somebody love me now
Cause my feet don't hit the ground
And I need some helping out
Cause I had it all before but now it really don't matter

Please darling, take me down
Cause I'm lost inside a crowd
Take me home now safe and sound
Cause I had it all before but now it really don't matter

Had it all before but now it really don't matter
Had it all before but now it really don't matter anymore

Something's cutting me like a knife
Something's taking my appetite for life
So don't you try to bring me down

Something's cutting me like a knife
Something's taking my appetite for life
So don't you try to bring me
So don't you try to bring me down

Whatever happens, I don't care
Cause I know just what you're giving me
You're giving me, honey

Somebody love me now
Cause my feet don't hit the ground
And I need some helping out
Cause I had it all before but now it really don't matter

Please darling take me down
Cause I'm lost inside a crowd
Take me home safe and sound
Cause I had it all before but now it really don't matter anymore

Really don't matter anymore
