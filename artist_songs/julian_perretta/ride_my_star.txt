The sun looks hot
And the grass looks green
And her face looks pale
Under my rainbow machine

So I took a bite
From a honey tree
And the stars turned angry
As they looked down at me

She said, do you, do want to, want to
Do you, do you want to, do you do you want to, she said, ride my star, all night

Where did you come from girl
Are you from some other place
'cuz you're far from heaven

Even to my level
And you're starting to make me hate

Don't let me fade away
I've only got 4 more lives to live
And they're an angel sat with my finger tips
When in all on my body

Do you do you want to, want to
Do you do you want to, want to
Do you do you want to, want to..
Ride my star all night
