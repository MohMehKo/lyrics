What would you do if the sky fell on you?
I wouldn’t know what to do I would
Call on your phone see if anyone’s home
If you don’t answer I’d fly away

Off to the stars spending time with the moon
Sharing a bowl of chocolate soup
It’s easy to see you’re falling behind
Now there’s no sky above you

There’s nothing nothing all the time
And I really don’t mind cos there’s
Something, something in your eyes
That makes it alright

So open your heart out, open your heart out
And let me love you
You’re rippin my heart out, you’re ripping my heart out
Today... oh oh oh oh...

I’ve started to think I should fall back in line
Maybe we’ll meet at that restaurant
The one where we felt we could sing all night
Carrying on in the taxi home

The sky don’t go grey when you cry
It only makes you miss the light
So bite my lip now while there’s time
Before we both just lose our minds

There’s nothing nothing all the time
And I really don’t mind cos there’s
Something, something in your eyes
That makes it alright

So open your heart out, open your heart out
And let me love you
You’re rippin my heart out, you’re ripping my heart out
Today... oh oh oh oh...

The sky don’t go grey when you cry
It only makes you miss the light
So bite my lip now while there’s time
Before we both just lose our minds

There’s nothing nothing all the time
And I really don’t mind cos there’s
Something, something in your eyes
That makes it alright

So open your heart out, open your heart out
And let me love you
You’re rippin my heart out, you’re ripping my heart out
Today... Today...
