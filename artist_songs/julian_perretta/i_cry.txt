I cry
I cry
I cry
I cry

So hard to think about
What we could have been
Where love could have taken us,
Blame on the wind and cry, cry, cry,
You know why

I'm drowning in an ocean of salt water
I couldn't make it anymore harder
That's why...

I cry, I cry, I cry, I cry every night
I cry, I cry, I cry, I cry every night

I hate that he looks at you
The way that I still do
I get so emotional
But can't we make a truce?
Cause I cry, cry,
You know why

I'm drowning in an ocean of salt water
I couldn't make it anymore harder
That's why...

I cry, I cry, I cry, I cry every night
I cry, I cry, I cry, I cry

Since you went away
Nothing's the same
No more
I cry
But I'll be okay
If you make your way
To my front door
I cry

Come back to me, yeah
Come back to me, yeah
Come back to me, yeah
Come back
Come back
Would you come back to me, yeah?
Come back to me, yeah
Come back to me, yeah
When you're gone
That's why...

I cry, I cry, I cry, I cry every night
I cry, I cry, I cry, I cry

Since you went away
Nothing's the same
No more
I cry
But I'll be okay
If you make your way
To my front door
I cry

For you
