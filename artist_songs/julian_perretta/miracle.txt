When the leaves turn brown
I watched it burn
Across the sun and above the clouds
The sirens clear
I'm ready to fall and find a lover that was meant for me
When the wolves run wild
I see myself
But you won't take this road I go down
The nights grow cold
The flame goes out
Living forever in a ghost town

You save me
I save you
A miracle that was meant for two
I save you
You save me
a miracle with every beat of my heart
With every beat of my heart
With every beat of my heart
With every beat of my heart
With every beat of my heart
With every beat of my heart

You save me
I save you
A miracle that was meant for two
I save you
You save me
a miracle with every beat of my heart
With every beat of my heart
With every beat of my heart
With every beat of my heart
With every beat of my heart
With every beat of my heart
