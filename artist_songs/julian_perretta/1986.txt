I tried so hard
Not to find the peculiarities in her heart
There were broken pieces underneath it
But I tried, to slip it, trip it to the back of my mind
Boy ya could do better, but she would never let ya

Marry me, Jesus Christ you must be joking
You’re just 23, girl what is that?
This ain’t me
Sunday morning drinking black tea
Being well behaved
And you’re just leading the way

Try it, you would wanna buy it
Take her out on Sunday you’ll be home by Monday
She be sippin’ tonic, you be getting on it
Like you did in 1986 with this
It’s tragic you be straight erotic though you never said it
She knows you always thought it
Why’s it never the same for me?
As it is for you?

So thinking back again
Before we were just emotionally tragical
It was cosy and carefree
So do not speak
And listen to what my mind is making
A bed that’s not worth a lay in
A story that’s not worth relaying

Try it, you would wanna buy it
Take her out on Sunday you’ll be home by Monday
She be sippin’ tonic, you be getting on it
Like you did in 1986 with this
It’s tragic you be straight erotic though you never said it
I know
Why’s it never the same for me?
Never the same for me
As it is for you?

Equality
It’s not a word you feel is familiar
For you it’s just about me and me
Dignity
Sailing in your shallow water
The taps run dry
You’re drowning in your gin and tonic

Try it, you would wanna buy it
Take her out on Sunday you’ll be home by Monday
She be sippin’ tonic, you be getting on it
Like you did in 1986 with this
It’s tragic you be straight erotic though you never said it
She knows you always thought it
Cos she’s like a mother
Don’t you even bother?
Cos you’re just wasting your time
Why’s it never the same for me? [x4]
