I said why, did ya ever even try?
Infiltrate but never find
Just fallin' slowly
You left me so damn lonely

Try
Steppin' back to when we rhymed
Maybe recreate the times
You were shy but happy
And we were fine and dandy

Here we are again, oh
But backseat love don't move me
I'm just far too choosy

Stop, drop, go through, open up the letter
Don't you want to make it any better
Baby don't you ever wonder why
Back up, it's not that I think you're clever
I just know that we could do much better
Baby, don't you ever wonder why
I was never by your side

Sigh, take a deep breath and rewind
Bite your tongue and let it slide
Got to see a doctor
Maybe that will shock ya
Love don't die, no
Especially when it penetrates and leaves you blind
And shaking mad and reckless
Got you feeling breathless

Here we go again
The backseat love don't move me
I'm just way too choosy
I'm just way too choosy

Stop, drop, pull through, open up the letter
Don't you want to make it any better
Baby, don't you ever wonder why
Back up, it's not that I think you're clever
I just know that we could do much better
Baby, don't you ever wonder why
I was never by your side
