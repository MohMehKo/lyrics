Just in case you're wondering
How much hurt I can take
It feels just like I'm stumbling across a line
That I shouldn't break
So take down all those pictures
Please, I don't wanna see no fake memories
Throwing stones at your window, pain
Standing out in the rain

I know you feel it 'cos I feel it too
I close my eyes and I'm right back with you
Don't have to say it
It's the game we play
You stitch me up and it's a shame, shame
Shame

A kiss won't take us anywhere
Just leaves us something to taste
A dream surrounds us everywhere
Even though we're both still awake
Feeling like I don't know you
Now, who are you, who am I, where are
We now?
But maybe we can find a moment
To be standing in the rain

I know you feel it 'cos I feel it too
I close my eyes and I'm right back with you
Don't have to say it
It's the game we play
You stitch me up and it's a shame, shame
Shame
& I'd say, when you say, there's no way
It's such a shame, shame, shame
& I'd say, with no pain, there's no gain
And it's a shame, shame, shame

Don't say the love is over
Don't say the love is over
Don't say it's love it's just a shame
Don't say the love is over
Don't say the love is over
Don't say it's love
It's just a shame, shame, shame

I know you feel it 'cos I feel it too
I close my eyes and I'm right back with you
Don't have to say it
It's the game we play
You stitch me up and it's a shame, shame
Shame
& I'd say, when you say, there's no way
It's such a shame, shame, shame
& I'd say, with no pain, there's no gain
And it's a shame, shame, shame
