Karma, Karma come and do your part
Karma, Karma cause she broke my heart
And even though you’re such a bitch I need you now
Karma, Karma don’t you let me down, don’t you let me down

I did not see her do it
One look and I knew it
Got me feeling stupid
And now I need a little help
Cause I won’t make it by myself

Anger told me that I couldn’t get no sleep
And I don’t think I wanna talk to jealousy

So Karma, Karma come and do your part
Karma, Karma cause she broke my heart
And even though you’re such a bitch I need you now
Karma, Karma don’t you let me down, don’t you let me down

I wish you’ll get through it
Cause if you don’t I will do it
Since you put me through it
Either way she deserves
Cause I don’t wanna cry for her

Anger told me that I couldn’t get no sleep
And I don’t think I wanna talk to jealousy

So Karma, Karma come and do your part
Karma, Karma cause she broke my heart
And even though you’re such a bitch I need you now
Karma, Karma don’t you let me down, don’t you let me down

So Karma, Karma come and do your part
Karma, Karma cause she broke my heart
And even though you’re such a bitch I need you now
Karma, Karma don’t you let me down, don’t you let me down
