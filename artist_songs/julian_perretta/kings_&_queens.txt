I remember when you told me
That the world is gonna pay
But while the buildings will be burning
I remember when you told me
That the world is gonna pay
But while the buildings will be burning
All the kings and queens will play
All our lives will start dividing
And everything will start to change
They'll be no need to keep on running
Because we won't escape the blame

So now all our dreams are broken
There's no need to fuss and fight
It's all in the hands of angels
And maybe were through

I recall the time he warned me
As we grow we learn to take
It doesn't matter how hard we're falling
We never learn from our mistakes
It's too late to start you're crying
When moneys dried up like the lakes
They'll be no need to be assertive
Cos we'll have lost all sense of gain

So now all our dreams are broken
There's no need to fuss and fight
It's all in the hands of angels
And maybe were through
So no need to ask the question
The answer won't make you smile
It's time for a change of heart now
We gotta pull through, we gotta pull through...

We gotta pull trough [x2]
And now all our dreams are broken
