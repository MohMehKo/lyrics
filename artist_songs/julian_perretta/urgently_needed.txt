What you wanted to be
Changed oh so oh drastically
I thought you love me
Now you hate me
And I’m starting to see
You in true colours, and it all just fell on its head

Please baby please
Release me from this mad dream
I have these visions
Of a dragon that is trying to kill me
Oh no she’s burnt down all your bridges

And here I am
With golden shackles on my hands
I’m sinking deeper in the sand
She’s got me facing an emergency

Dried up with no where left to go
She doesn’t even know
She’s urgently needed, urgently needed

I wanna fly to Paris
Where we can sit happily
I’ve got an idea of how you can spend all of your money
Buying me diamonds, oh the fun that is to be had
What on earth do you mean?
I thought you just turned 19
She’s started lying this does not taste as good
As it first seemed
Head under water, what are you to do with yourself?

And here I am
With golden shackles on my hands
I’m sinking deeper in the sand
She’s got me facing an emergency
Dried up with no where left to go
She doesn’t even know
She’s urgently needed, urgently needed

There I go sailing off down a river
Though I know I’m not number one but I feel like a winner
Now she’s touching but don’t stop there cos I feel I’m getting nearer
Maybe something’s wrong with me? Yeeaah

And here I am
With golden shackles on my hands
I’m sinking deeper in the sand
She’s got me facing an emergency
Dried up with no where left to go
She doesn’t even know
She’s urgently needed, urgently needed
Urgently needed, urgently needed, urgently needed
Urgently needed...
