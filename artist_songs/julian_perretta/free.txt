Where did we go wrong
Where did we lose our faith
My brother is in need
But can he depend on me
If you think one of you tried
Maybe you could find
A better friend than any other
If you gave more than you took
Life could be so good
Come on and try
Now's the time

'Cause you're free
To do what you want to do
You've got to live your life
To do what you want to do
'Cause you're free

'Cause you're free
To do what you want to do
You've got to live your life
To do what you want to do
'Cause you're free

Are we all strangers
Does anyone really care
Deep down we're all the same
Just trying to hide our pain
You think you can never trust another
They're all out to get ya
We have to live in this world together
If we open up our hearts
Love can finally start
Come on and try
Now's the time

'Cause you're free
To do what you want to do
You've got to live your life
And do what you want to do
'Cause you're free

Now's the time
'Cause you're free
To do what you want to do
You've got to live your life
And do what you want to do

'Cause you're free
To do what you want to do
You've got to live your life
And do what you want to do

'Cause you're free
To do what you want to do
You've got to live your life
And do what you want to do
