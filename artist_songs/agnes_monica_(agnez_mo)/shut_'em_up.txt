Shut shut em up shut shut shut em up [x2]
Shake the club up shut shut shut shut em up

Shut shut em up shut shut shut em up [x3]
Shake the club up shut shut shut shut em up

[Chorus:] 
They hate the way I put it down,
All the ladies tryna jock my style.
Got em screaming turn the speakers out loud.

Shake the club up, shake the club, now shut em up.
Shut shut em up shut shut shut em up [x3]
Shake the club up shut shut shut shut em up

[Verse 1:]
If you got swag turn it up on high,
Whip yo head if ya know ya fly

Imma tear the club up tonight.
And Imma shut em up, and Imma shut em up.
Got ‘em scared cuz I’m dangerous,
They want my shine, but the get no love.
And I don’t care cuz they all jealous.
And Imma shut em up, and Imma shut em up

[Chorus] 

[Verse 2:]
Haters get mad so they talk that noise,
But I’m a diva so I keep my poise.
Go ahead you can use your voice,
But imma shut em up, oh imma shut em up.
Nananananana (so whatchu saying)
Nanananannnna (so whatchu saying)
Why you Talking that BLA BLA BLA
You can shut it up, you can shut it up!!

[Chorus] 

Shake the club up shut shut shut shut em up
Shut shut shut shut em up

[Chorus]
