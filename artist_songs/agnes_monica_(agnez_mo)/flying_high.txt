Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up
don’t stop
We gon’ take it up a level, 
We gon’ turn it up a notch
If you don’t like whatchu been doin’
now it’s time to switch it up
l-l-l-listen up

You can call me complicated crazy, 
call me crazy if you want
but we all one in the same, 
so get your back up off the wall

And go and get it [x8]

Coz I don’t need to hear it
When the rain comes down, 
I will be the sun through the cloud
Nobody can steal my crown, 
they can try if they want to

I’ll fly-y-y-y-y-y flyin’ high
fly-y-y-y-y-y flyin’ high

And go and get it [x8]

Coz I don’t need to hear it
Wake it up
Wake it up
Wake it up right now
You’ve been wasting too much time, 
time to get up off the couch
O-o-ok you put my name up in your mouth
But but let let me see what’chu about

You can call me complicated, 
call me crazy if you want
but we all one in the same, 
so get your back up off the wall

Even when the rain comes down, 
I will be the sun through the cloud
Nobody can steal my crown, 
They can try if they want to
I’ll fly-y-y-y-y-y flying high
fly-y-y-y-y-y flying high
and we fly high tonight…
