They call me fire
They call me ice
Put it together
Baby I'll be kryptonite

My body's raging intoxicating
Just turn me up and I'll be ready to ignite

I'm so hot
You form a radiation
I'm so hot
Can you feel it circulating
Don't wanna hurt you baby
Don't wanna burn you up
One touch from me you won't survive

Baby.. I'm a regenade..aww..aww..aww [x2]
I'll be breakin' all the rules
Breakin' all the rules [x2]
Tonight

Call me explosive
Like a dynamite
You push my buttons
I won't be polite.. No..

My body's raging intoxicating
Just turn me up and I'll be ready to ignite

Baby.. I'm a RENEGADE..
