Call up some friends and let's hit the mall
Been working hard now it's time to ball
We outta school so let's make a move
Let's break a rule man let's act a fool
I got a team and we all clean
We gotta dream to be young kings
I tell a hater stay blessed up
Somebody tell em that we're next up

You know we gotta do it big everything brand new
Everything brand new
If they mad that's cool
Imma win not lose
We're just looking at the world from a rooftop view
Aiming for the moon
We gone get there soon
And we do Imma shine with my whole crew

Imma shine with my whole crew
Just wanna shine with my whole crew
So many things that we been through
Been through
So Imma shine with my whole crew
So many things that we been through
Been through

I'm chasing dreams in the paper lane
I'm not like you we are not the same
I'm working hard tryna handle biz
Come to my city and see how we live
I'm tryna make it to the top spot yeah
I'm tryna make us all millionaires
So let me see your ones in the air
Cause we're going to the top this year

You know we gotta do it big everything brand new
Everything brand new
If they mad that's cool
Imma win not lose
We're just looking at the world from a rooftop view
Aiming for the moon
We gone get there soon
And we do Imma shine with my whole crew

Imma shine with my whole crew
Just wanna shine with my whole crew
So many things that we been through
Been through
So Imma shine with my whole crew

We tryin to shine like them stars at night
We going up, how high, like satellites
I hit the road, do a show, stick me on that flight
Cause when I touch the ground, I'm making a new sound
The hottest around. Check the tag and the swagger
This is the kid that's young and ambitious
More grind, on these ones and twos
And Imma shine with my whole crew
Now what the hook do

Imma shine with my whole crew
Just wanna shine with my whole crew
So many things that we been through
Been through
So Imma shine with my whole crew
So many things that we been through
Been through
