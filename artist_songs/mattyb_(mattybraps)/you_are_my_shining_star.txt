[Chorus:]
Honey you are my shining star
Don't you go away, oh baby
Wanna be right here where you are
'Till my dying day, oh baby

You hear about some people
Who met when they just kids
They started as friends 
But then somehow it never ends
It turns to something special
Something like what we have
I wonder if one day we’ll be those people saying that
We can’t predict the future
Its just I care about you
And I don’t wanna go a day without you less I have to
Because I really like you
So much that I can’t hide it
And it’s kinda hard for me to explain how I feel inside, but

When you laugh then I laugh
And I smile when you smile
And I’m here we can chill 
And just talk for a while, cause I
I never knew that I could feel this strong
And I just need you here under my arm

[Chorus]

So many other people
Searching the world to find
Something that's truly special
Like this love of yours and mine
If I could ever show you
I'd help you realize
Girl that you were sent from heaven
You're an angel in disguise
I'll never leave you lonely
No matter what it takes
Give my love to you only 
Each and every single day
So take this as a promise
My special way of saying
I'll be yours forever and that's something
That will never change

When you laugh then I laugh
And I smile when you smile
And I’m here we can chill 
And just talk for a while, cause I
I never knew that I could feel this strong
And I just need you here under my arm

[Chorus]

So tell me what you’re thinking
Tell me what’s on your mind
If you give me a secret
I’ll tell you one of mine
Then we can trust each other
And maybe over time
Go together, grow together, be by each other’s side
I wrote this song about you
And hope this can be
Happily ever after
You know like in the movies
Ain’t gotta figure it all out
Just keep it real
I’m tryna tell you how I feel

When you laugh then I laugh
And I smile when you smile
And I’m here we can chill 
And just talk for a while, cause I
I never knew that I could feel this strong
And I just need you here under my arm

[Chorus]
