First time
All I could think was my, oh my
I'm in love for the first time
The first time, tonight, tonight
My, Oh, My, Oh, Oh, Oh
My, Oh, My, Oh, Oh, Oh
I'm in love for the first time tonight, tonight
My, Oh, My

Call it crazy how she do it
Makes it seem like nothing to it
Got my stupid, acting foolish
Got my caught up, shot by cupid
Shorty got all them other's jealous
With them looks from all the fellas
Red lipstick and dark mascara
She can sing it acapella
Got me feeling like, you, you, you
Might be the one that I've been waiting all this time now to, to, to
Give everything that I've got, give me a shot babe to prove, prove
That I'm the best, not like the rest
You got my heart beating BOOM BOOM
Out of my chest
It's love and I must confess, hey

First time
All I could think was my, oh my
I'm in love for the first time
The first time, tonight, tonight
My, Oh, My, Oh, Oh, Oh
My, Oh, My, Oh, Oh, Oh
I'm in love for the first time tonight, tonight
My, Oh, My

Got me choosing, got me losing
All this time, from my pursuing
I'm advancing, now we dancing
We both caught up in the music
And I must be, be dreaming
Wonder what this girl is thinking, thinking
Music up so loud we screaming
We got our hands up to the ceiling
I don't mind if we spend more time
Cause I'm looking at you, you
So what ya gonna do, do
Come my way
Give me one shot babe to prove, prove
That I'm the best, not like the rest
You got my heart beating BOOM BOOM
Out of my chest
It's love and I must confess, hey

First time
All I could think was my, oh my
I'm in love for the first time
The first time, tonight, tonight
My, Oh, My, Oh, Oh, Oh
My, Oh, My, Oh, Oh, Oh
I'm in love for the first time tonight, tonight
My, Oh, My

You da one, you da one
That I'm thinking bout all day
Have some fun, have some fun
Baby you should come my way

We can dance, we can dance
We'll just let the music play
Give me love, give me love
You're the one that makes me say

First time
All I could think was my, oh my
I'm in love for the first time
The first time, tonight, tonight
My, Oh, My, Oh, Oh, Oh
My, Oh, My, Oh, Oh, Oh
I'm in love for the first time tonight, tonight
My, Oh, My
