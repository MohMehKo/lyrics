[Skylar Stecker:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note o-oh
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
So sing along to my stereo

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like it read it well, check it, Matty, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last beat that played me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to used to, now I'm over that
Not holding on to older lyrics like ancient artifacts
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hands
To keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Skylar Stecker:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
So sing along to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh, to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, so sing along to my stereo

If I was an old-school, fifty pound boombox
(Remember them)
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops?
And crank it higher every time you hear the beat drop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
I'm playing hard but working harder, that's the motto B
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
T' keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus Repeat]
