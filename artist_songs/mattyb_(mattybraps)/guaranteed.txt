Took a little of my heart
Drained some energy
You may have taken your shots
But not the best of me
Standing here on my feet
Proud as I can be
I have planted the seed
I've guaranteed

I never thought that I’d be the 
Kind of guy to get shy in a social situation, well
Given my obvious experiences and my occupation
And I’m grateful
I gotta gift and I use it
Through my music, but 
Just cause I’m able
Doesn’t mean I need for people to see me get upon a table
Like, sometimes I'll see a cute girl from afar
And we’ll both make eye contact
Then I can tell she’ll recognize me as MattyB
Then, ha, there goes that
She’ll get kind of excited, lip biting
Try to hide it, fight it
Get the courage from a friend kinda nervous
Wanna get a hug and a photo op

You know that type of way
You never felt before
She might just be my muse
Or she could be my girl
I know these thoughts are crazy
So I’ll never tell her, no, no

Took a little of my heart
Drained some energy
You may have taken your shots
But not the best of me
Standing here on my feet
Proud as I can be
I have planted the seed
I've guaranteed

Use it in the music
If you’ve had a bad day then smile through it
Never know when it might be over, don’t abuse it
But, I’m human
Sometimes I can walk in a room and not talk
And people automatically assume I’m rude
“Matter fact, if I had what he had”
“Then I would be so…”
Shy too
These cute girls flirtin’
And I’m trying not to get nervous
I don’t talk so they feel worthless
But inside I think they perfect
And it's crazy
I can invade a stadium stage with all eyes on me, but
Get me one-on-one after the show and I might get weak in my knees!

You know that type of way
You never felt before
She might just be my muse
Or she could be my girl
I know these thoughts are crazy
So I’ll never tell her, no, no

Took a little of my heart
Drained some energy
You may have taken your shots
But not the best of me
Standing here on my feet
Proud as I can be
I have planted the seed
I've guaranteed
