If I was your best friend I'd never let you go
We could go to places we ain't never been before
Maybe take a chance or we'd never ever know
I've got time on my hands and I wanna spend more
Swag swag swag, more than a little
Chillin' in the park while we're eating popsicles
I don't know about me but I know about you
Say hello to falsetto in 3-2-swaggie

I'd like to be everything you want
Hey girl let me talk to you

If I was your boyfriend I'd never let you go
I'd keep you on my arm girl 
You'd never be alone
and I could be a gentleman
Treat you how you want
If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go, I'd never let you go

Tell me what you like - yeah
Tell me what you want
I could be your Buzz Lightyear
Fly across the globe
I don't ever wanna fight
Yeah you already know
I could make you shine bright
Like you're standing in the snow
BURR
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the w-w-world ends
We could dance, do a spin and a twirl and
Voice gone crazy on this hook like a whirlwind (super swag)

I'd like to be everything you want
Hey girl let me talk to you

If I was your boyfriend I'd never let you go
I'd keep you on my arm girl 
You'd never be alone
and I could be a gentleman
Treat you how you want
If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go, I'd never let you go
