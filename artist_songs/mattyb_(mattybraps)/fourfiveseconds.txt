[Chanel Loran:]
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin' (Oh Yeah)
I wish somebody would tell me "Ooo that's all I want"

[Matt:]
Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin' and I'm positive
Then I heard you was talkin' trash 
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz

[Chorus:]
Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
Oh yeah, I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

[Chanel Loran:]
And I know that you're home tonight
Thinkin', "how could I be so selfish?"
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been
Now I know that you're home tonight
Thinkin' "how could I be so reckless?"
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand

[Matt:]
If my girl goes out tonight
Will we still be alright?
I wish I could change the time
To back when that girl is mine

[Both:]
See all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

[Chorus:]
Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
Oh yeah, I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
