I sung a melody the other day
I was humming to myself, “Man I wish you were my girlfriend”
And I was hoping you would come my way
But you keep to yourself cause you probably got a boyfriend
It ain’t my character to be that guy
I ain’t tripping, I’ll be dipping if things don’t feel right
I just want to make you smile
Write you a song, get to know what you like

What’s your name girl, where you from?
Where you going, can I come?
Is it real girl or make believe?
I think I hear you singing

Baby if it weren’t for you, baby if it weren’t for you
I’d be lonely
And everywhere I go
Only thing between us right now is a stereo
Cause all I really want is you, all I really want is you, you only
And everywhere I go
Only thing between us right now is a stereo [x3]

No lie, tongue tied, real, feeling young inside
Don’t leave, can’t stay, miss you in the worst way
True love, maybe so, you know I’m a rolling stone
On the road doing shows, call me on my cell phone
Miss you, miss you, now I gotta tease
But one day we’ll grow up and maybe I’ll be on one knee
Cause I like you, mic booth only thing I know, so I’m calling through your stereo

What’s your name girl, where you from?
Where you going, can I come?
Is it real girl or make believe?
I think I hear you singing

Baby if it weren’t for you, baby if it weren’t for you
I’d be lonely
And everywhere I go
Only thing between us right now is a stereo
Cause all I really want is you, all I really want is you, you only
And everywhere I go
Only thing between us right now is a stereo

And even our friends pretend that they’ve searched the world
But I’m patient, waiting for my special girl
I’m a young teen searching for my Mrs. Morris
Know you’re out there, chyeah, sing my back this chorus like

Baby if it weren’t for you, baby if it weren’t for you
I’d be lonely
And everywhere I go
Only thing between us right now is a stereo
Cause all I really want is you, all I really want is you, you only
And everywhere I go
Only thing between us right now is a stereo [repeat]
