I stay out too late!
We chillin, making some crazy moves
We got our feed kicked back
Relaxin' that's how we do
My leading ladies on this chorus
I'm killin' the 1's and 2's 
Derek Jeter flow
Shakin' off haters is what we do
You go on too many dates
Girl you trippin'
Only like 3 or 4
Boy please! Really Matt?
Ok maybe a couple more
But my generations beautiful
People around
Living life free (Yup!)
No need for for keeping score

So I keep cruisin'
Can't stop wont stop movin'
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying its gonna be alright

Cause the playas gonna play play play play play
And the haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate
Baby I'm just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Shake it off, shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break break break break break
And the fakers gonna fake fake fake fake fake
Baby I'm just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Shake it off, shake it off

I never miss a beat
Beat beat pow
Bobbin' weavin' these verses
It'll be a hot day in December
Before I forgot my purpose
Shake it once for the song at hand
Even thought I can't quite understand it
But I just put my heart in the music
And I never take this for granted
This for all the kids who shake it
In the face of their circumstance
(shake it!) great or small it's simple
We shake it then shake again
You caught me dreamin
Spittin these lyrics outta my soul
You already know
Baby we shake it sss-so!

So I keep cruisin'
Can't stop wont stop movin'
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying its gonna be alright

Cause the playas gonna play play play play play
And the haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate
Baby I'm just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Shake it off, shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break break break break break
And the fakers gonna fake fake fake fake fake
Baby I'm just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Shake it off, shake it off

Shake it off, shake it off, off, off, off
Shake it off, shake it off, off, off, off
Shake it off, shake it off, off, off, off
Shake it off, shake it off

Hey hey hey!
While you've been over there
Getting down and out about the liars
And the dirty dirty cheats of the world
You could have been getting down
To this sick beat
My best friend got a new boyfriend 
She like, "You're not supposed to tell!" 
But I did anyway!
And to the fella over there
With the pretty blonde hair
Won't you come on over Matty
We can shake shake shake

Yeah - Cause the playas gonna play play play play play
And the haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate
Baby I'm just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Shake it off, shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break break break break break
And the fakers gonna fake fake fake fake fake
Baby I'm just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Shake it off, shake it off

Shake it off, shake it off, off, off, off
Shake it off, shake it off, off, off, off
Shake it off, shake it off, off, off, off
Shake it off, shake it off

Shake it off, shake it off, off, off, off
Shake it off, shake it off, off, off, off
Shake it off, shake it off, off, off, off
Shake it off, shake it off
