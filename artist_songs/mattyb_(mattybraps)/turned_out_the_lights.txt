[Maddi:]
Where are you now
Why did you go
Give me a reason for leaving
A reason your heart turned to stone
Now it's so cold
You saw me standing with tears in my eyes
and then you turned out the lights

[MattyB:]
Dear Matt, I know we've never really met each other
But you've helped me out so much I felt I had to write this letter
You might not know it when your making your beats
But every lyric and syllable's like you're speaking to me
Cause where I'm from they don't encourage a kid with a dream
And every time I have an idea that I believe in
It gets stomped or squashed and then I feel lost
Like it wanna go dig a hole feeling so low
Don't get me wrong, I believe but get real Matt
Sometimes it's difficult to achieve when people don't believe back
I'm not complaining but it's hard to go after my goals 
Cause the people I need most just leave they're cold
My teacher told me that I'll never amount to anything
But I wrote a chorus for you to sing
I know it's probably not good enough
Not even close
But it's how I feel most so it goes

[Maddi:]
Where are you now
Why did you go
Give me a reason for leaving
A reason your heart turned to stone
Now it's so cold
You saw me standing with tears in my eyes
and then you turned out the lights

[Maddi:]
Lights you turned out the lights
Lights why'd you turn out the lights

[MattyB:]
Everyday brings a new struggle
In every situation is a moment where a choice can bring new trouble
Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna bust like a bubble
Here's what I've been through, now let me inspire you
I hope you never have to feel what it's like, to feel lost
The cost of not a friend in site
Despite your best efforts you can't fight back
When you love someone but they don't love you back Matt
Remember us in your lyrics when you write that
The kids that don't have it all within an arms grasp
Can we dream too? Or is it fantasy? I need to place where I fit in, in the family 
So I'mma choose to believe despite all of these words that sting
All of the hurtful things
With these few words I sing
Just keep it real on the mic B
And you've got a fan for life 

[Maddi:]
Where are you now
Why did you go
Give me a reason for leaving
A reason our heart turned to stone
Now it's so cold
You saw me standing with tears in my eyes
and then you turned out the lights

[Maddi:]
Lights you turned out the lights
Lights why'd you turn out the lights

[MattyB:]
We at the point of no return
There ain't no coming back
When it comes to love you never know how to react
Gotta keep your head up
Can't live in the past
I know you feel bad but it goes in a flash
[x2]

[Maddi:]
Where are you now
Why did you go
Give me a reason for leaving
A reason our heart turned to stone
Now it's so cold
You saw me standing with tears in my eyes
and then you turned out the lights
