Sometimes out the blue life takes a turn
Unexpected and there's much to learn
Much to earn... the price of life
Sitting the dark when it hits the lights
Hit's the fan and it hits the fam
Looking at my hands like here I am
How and why did we end up here
Close our eyes and we say a prayer like
I need God... need a super hero
I need help that can fly my way
I need an angel that can save me
I need a man with a bright red cape
Some people live and make it
Other times we fall too hard
Sometimes we gather the strength
To stand up and fight 'til we beat the odds!

I'm bullet proof, nothing to loose
Fire away fire away
Rickochet you take your aim
Fire away fire away
You shoot me down
But I wont fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down
But I wont fall
I am titanium...

It's kind of hard to get off the ground
Stuck in a place - no wings around
Helpless - lost hope and health
Didn't feel like you could carry yourself
But... boy was I wrong
Found the strength to just carry on
Much amazed... day by day
Found the words to write a new song
And now... we know life is good
Words can't express when you found you could
Words can't express when you understood
That you can take your life and get second chance
2nd dance... best for last
Look at your hands like here I am!
And now your troubles passed and you overcame
And now the man in the mirror doesn't look the same... yeah!

I'm bullet proof, nothing to loose
Fire away fire away
Rickochet you take your aim
Fire away fire away
You shoot me down
But I wont fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down
But I wont fall
I am titanium...
