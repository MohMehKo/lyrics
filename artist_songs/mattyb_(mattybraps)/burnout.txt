Breathe in breathe out
Make some noise if your engine's loud
Big stage - first place
Thank the Lord I'm gonna win this race
Rippin' up the black top
Riding through the pit stop
This is the place where big dreams are made
Breathe in - breathe out
Before you turn around and face this crowd
Burnout! ...Burnout!
Well I pop the clutch
Split the track
Like I'm an outlaw on the run
And when my rhymes combust
I'll leave nothing but dust
By the time I'm said and done (chyeah)
I stay 3 lanes wide
Countin' 'em off - they're like
Boogity boogity boog-i-ty
And if you came to party 'n to
Have a good time then
Let me hear you scream!
Peddle to the mettle gotta get on my level
Cause you never know where a winner might be
That's why I'm rock and roll - heart and soul
Ridin' over these guitar strings
I'm on the final stretch - my engine's roaring
See that checkered flag and wave
You better know one thing when I cross the finish
I was made in the USA (come on)
Breathe in breathe out
Make some noise if your engine's loud
Big stage - first place
Thank the Lord I'm gonna win this race
Rippin' up the black top
Riding through the pit stop
This is the place where big dreams are made
Breathe in - breathe out
Before you turn around and face this crowd
Burnout! ...Burnout!
Now that the race is over
Cement is coolin
But the night has just begun
I said you're best to bet
That on a NASCAR evening
Everybody has fun
And one thing's for sure
And this I'm certain
Of in every country town
You know we like our cars - like we like our parties
That's where everybody gets down
So let's spark the grill
Blaze the bon pit
The smell of wood in fire
A big 'ol BBQ after a hard days work is
What a country law requires
I got my family right next to me
These good times spent with my friends
A lot of food and cars under the country stars
'Till next week when we do it again and again we breathe in
Breathe in breathe out
Make some noise if your engine's loud
Big stage - first place
Thank the Lord I'm gonna win this race
Rippin' up the black top
Riding through the pit stop
This is the place where big dreams are made
Breathe in - breathe out
Before you turn around and face this crowd
Burnout! ...Burnout!
Now you don't have to be - born and raised
To have some country in your blood
And if you hear somebody say otherwise
You know his truck's stuck in the mud
So here's what I'll do
And I'll share it with you
You gotta stand up right real tall
And just look that man right square in the eyes
And give a country felt yee-haw!
Breathe in breathe out
Make some noise if your engine's loud
Big stage - first place
Thank the Lord I'm gonna win this race
Rippin' up the black top
Riding through the pit stop
This is the place where big dreams are made
Breathe in - breathe out
Before you turn around and face this crowd
Burnout!
