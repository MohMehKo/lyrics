[James Maslow:]
You're never too young to fall in love (in love) 
You're never too young to 

[MattyB:]
What's up with the day (day) 
People talkin' bout me 
They say what's up with your age man 
Why you wanna doubt me 
See me living while I'm young 
Say I couldn't, shouldn't, won't 
Oh I cant? That's whats up 
I'mma do it on my own 
This goes out to everybody 
Chasing after what they want 
It don't matter where you've been 
It only matters where you're going 
I see you and I think about an angel from above 
But they keep on telling me it's puppy love 

[James Maslow:]
You make me feel like everything we have is real 
Every time I look at you it makes me smile 

I've been thinking about you every night 
All the time - Can't get you off my mind 
I just want to hold you tight 
Feels so right when I've got you by side 
They say that we're wrong 
And we don't know what love is 
They say we're too young 

But you're never too young to fall in love (in love) 
You're never too young to fall in love (in love) 
You're never to young to fall 
(in love in love - you're never too young to fall) 

[MattyB:] 
Have you ever had a dream where 
Things ain't what they seem and 
Everything you want is right in front of you 
Standing there 
Hoping and praying that you can finally make it be 
Open your eyes and realize that it ain't a dream and 
Everything you see here is the truth my reality 
Young but I'm going for it 
Hater's 'gonna be mad at me 
I see you and I think about an angel from above 
I don't care if they keep saying puppy love

[MattyB:]
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
What's up with that hate 
Why you always trippin' every time you come my way 
Every time I come around you try to bring me down 
I don't get why you are so infatuated with me now 
Hair long curl 
You my favorite girl (girl) 
Hang around with me and maybe we can change the world 
You're my favorite melody the reason for my song 
We won't let nobody tell us we're too young - chyeah
