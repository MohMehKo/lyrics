Thought it was over, ha... MB let me see
I wasn't born last night I know some girls ain't right
cause you'll be talking on the phone last night
she'll have you rapping and singing after the show last night
Uhh homie that's that nerve you give a girl your heart
But you treat her like dirt you think it's really something but she playin' with your mind that's a puppy love goes at least for the first time
I ain't lying ohh homie that's that nerve you all about her but shes such a big flirt
Young Mattyb on the mic through thick and thin and you'll be going alright if you ain't tricked again ha
When a cute girls flirtin' and you call her but she wont click over
ohh that girl ain't loyal
say ohh that girl ain't loyal
let me see
Just got texted another same message
most of your friends say flex
you gotta treat your lady with respect like
you gotta nice girl hanging close by
introduce her to the stage life
eyes closed living in the moment
thinking about the future what you really after
she gotta be real
hang out just chill
got a show and she will see you after
Understand that I was a rapper
When a cute girls flirtin' and you call her but she wont click over
ohh that girl ain't loyal
say ohh that girl ain't loyal
let me see 
When a cute girls flirtin' and you call her but she wont click over
ohh that girl ain't loyal
say ohh that girl ain't loyal
let me see...
