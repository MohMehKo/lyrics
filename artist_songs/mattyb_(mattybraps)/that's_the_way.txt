Turn it up cause this my jam
It's got me swinging through the city like Spiderman
You know that you're fingers and my hat match
I put it on and they both snap back
A little pop hit with a slick rap
Will save the world like the men in black
So where ya been? Where you going? Where you at?
I'm just gonna bounce and see if you bounce back
Cause if I know one think, I know this
You've gotta be yourself for the world to notice
And it don't matter age size shape color
That's my word, my word to your mother
Believe you can change the game
Be like "oh na na" hater what's my name?
Cause when you fly off, they'll stay the same
Cause they just tryin' to crumple your paper airplane so come on

Come on you're never gonna have a good time
If you don't see the bright side
Let me see ya move now
That's the way, that's the way, yeah
Alright - why you gotta be so uptight
Don't you know that you're big time
Let me see you move now
That's the way, that's the way, yeah

Gimmie the, gimmie the, gimmie the microphone
And we can do it like this - until the clouds are gone I'm seein
Blue skys because that's how my story goes
Number one rap song on your stereo
I've got a feeling that the rythem is right
And I was calling just to see what you were doing tonight
We've got a party on the roof top top of the school
And I heard everybody's coming cause the principal's cool - and and uh
And if it's at one thing I'm gettin'
Sometimes you've gotta throw your own party to fit in
And if you feel small make yourself taller
Ain't nothing wrong with poppin' your collar
You've gotta find your zone and if the walls are shaking then the music on
So go ahead and move to what the DJ's playing
Cause everybody here's singing singing my song saying

Come on you're never gonna have a good time
If you don't see the bright side
Let me see ya move now
That's the way, that's the way, yeah
Alright - why you gotta be so uptight
Don't you know that you're big time
Let me see you move now
That's the way, that's the way, yeah

And even when your days feel long
And people try to prove you wrong
And say they don't like your song
You feel like trading places
Just know we've got your back
Forever that's a fact
If you ain't down with that
We're making funny faces

Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah

Nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah

Come on you're never gonna have a good time
If you don't see the bright side
Let me see ya move now
That's the way, that's the way, yeah
Alright - why you gotta be so uptight
Don't you know that you're big time
Let me see you move now
That's the way, that's the way, yeah
