[Coco Jones:]
You see me flyin high oh
Cause I choose to live my life oh

[MattyB:]
Now I never try to stay in the past no looking back
But if you would have told me three years ago said Matt
Here's where you'll be at I'd probably would laugh
Matter fact I'd call you crazy
Cause a kid with a dream raps
You taught me to last
So here I sit my collection of tracks
Not too much different than when we first started
With just a pen and a pad
Still feel the love and the hate
It still ain't nothing to shake
I'm just a kid but the difference I do what it takes, uh

[Coco Jones:]
I know what you probably think about me
Coming up in the world too quickly
But I've got big things on my mind (big things on my mind)

Say what you want know you're never gonna phase me
Got nothing but love for ya anyway
This is exactly who I am

You see me flying high oh
Cause I choose to live my life oh
My dreams are way up in the sky oh
Real far from the haters
Rising up to the majors yeah
and you're never gonna bring me down

[MattyB:]
Now you can say what you want
Just have the courage to talk it
Like when you walk up on somebody
And all the sudden they stop
They make up rumors behind your back
But of course they can't prove it
They said it wasn't me spittin'
Somebody forced me to do it
Just let the kids be kids
Well what you think that we doing
I fused the rap with the pop
You see my life in the music
I put my heart into something big
Make 'em watch as I do it
So to my friends then I applaud you're courage to do it, uh

[Coco Jones:]
I know what you probably think about me
Coming up in the world too quickly
But I've got these dreams on my mind (big dreams on my mind)
Say what you want know you're never gonna phase me
Got nothing but love for ya anyway
Just trying to be who I am

You see me flying high oh
Cause I choose to live my life oh
My dreams are way up in the sky oh
Real far from the haters
Rising up to the majors yeah
and you're never gonna bring me down

[MattyB:]
Hey what you talking 'bout why you wanna doubt
All we do is make it happen all you do is run your mouth

Here's a tissue for your issue save it for a rainy day, ha!
Hey what you talking 'bout why you wanna slip
We were made to overcome it all you ever do is trip
You can hold your breath and hate till you turn blue in the face
But the fact is that we dreamers so we know we here to stay

[Coco Jones:]
You see me flying high oh
Cause I choose to live my life oh
My dreams are way up in the sky oh
Real far from the haters
Rising up to the majors yeah
