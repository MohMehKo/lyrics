[Brooke Adee:]
Now baby, I don’t want bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
Now take a look what you’ve done
Cause baby, I don’t want bad blood, hey!

[MattyB:]
You can't take it back, look where we at
You made me need a DOC, remember that?
My TLC was OCD, ID my facts
Now POV of you and me, is lookin' bad
I don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a sad heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No I don't fear no more, better yet respect ain't quite sincere no more

[Brooke Adee:]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
He and I

Now baby, I don’t want bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
Now take a look what you’ve done
Cause baby, I don’t want bad blood, hey!
Ya we got problems
But I just think we can solve 'em
I made a really deep cut
But baby, I don’t want bad blood, hey!

[MattyB:]
Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need yah
Follow procedure, remember? Oh wait you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars
Body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Broke all my heart, can’t believe you would say that
Naw, you gotta live with this payback now

[Brooke Adee:]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

Now baby, I don’t want bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
Now take a look what you’ve done
Cause baby, I don’t want bad blood, hey!
Ya we got problems
But I just think we can solve 'em
I made a really deep cut
Cause baby, I don’t want bad blood, hey!
