I'm from down south where we always got sunshine
They say you can't be a light if it wasn't for the dark side
Some days you gotta smile through all the broken times
It'll all be fine, it's all in your mind, oh yeah
We were paralyzed by fear, now we more than kids, we up

We just chasing dreams, chasing dreams
California dreamin, oh yeah
You know that we just chasing dreams, chasing dreams
California dreamin, oh yeah

oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Gotta get your sunshine
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
California dreamin

Sometimes I'll get home from school and see people on the news
Arguing with each other and yelling their point of view
While people fighting and rioting and shooting to kill each other
Somebody's brother - POW - There goes another
I wish love would be our drugs and bullets could heal each other
Smiles instead of tears - be kind and real to each other
We just wanna live our life, red and yellow black and white
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be alright like

We just chasing dreams, chasing dreams
California dreamin, oh yeah
You know that we just chasing dreams, chasing dreams
California dreamin, oh yeah

oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Gotta get your sunshine
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
California dreamin

Now I'm sending all the love that's inside my soul
All across the globe, let's see where it goes
I'll be sending all the love that's inside my soul
Let's see where it goes

We just chasing dreams, chasing dreams
California dreamin, oh yeah
You know that we just chasing dreams, chasing dreams
California dreamin, oh yeah

oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Gotta get your sunshine
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
California dreamin
