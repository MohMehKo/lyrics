I'll meet you under blue skies, blue skies
We can share the sunshine, sunshine
We going up up, it's going down
We turning up up, it's going down
Under blue skies

Sun is blazing, feels amazing, memories is what we making
Hearts are racing, girls we chasing, soaking up these summer rays and
Music's bumping, fists are pumping, laughing and we keep it coming
Living like it's now or never and the moments all or nothing
You ain't gotta have a lot of money in your pocket
You can show up in whatever like whatever I'mma rock it
You don't need no invitation, we ain't got no special tickets
Cause we're all just normal people
And we hope that you can kick it

Under blue skies, blue skies
We can share the sunshine, sunshine
We going up up, it's going down
We turning up up, it's going down
I'll meet you under blue skies, blue skies
We can share the sunshine, sunshine
We going up up, it's going down
We turning up up, it's going down under blue skies

Switch up my rhyme, I gotta be cool for the summer time
Me and my fellas at the lake house with the shades out
Tryna lay out… cause the babes out
Jet skis and boats, burgers and cokes
Holding competitions with my friends on who can be lazy the most
Ain't got a care in the world cause we just keep laughing and hollering and we'll
Forget about the time until our parents start calling
Cause it's them summer days like this where all our problems can melt
And we don't worry ‘bout tomorrow, let it take care of itself

Under blue skies, blue skies
We can share the sunshine, sunshine
We going up up, it's going down
We turning up up, it's going down
I'll meet you under blue skies, blue skies
We can share the sunshine, sunshine
We going up up, it's going down
We turning up up, it's going down under blue skies

Crazy hair, never cared what them other people say
I'm just tryna have a little fun each and every day
I'm just tryna say, tryna say what's been on my mind
I'm just tryna live everyday like it's summertime
Crazy hair, never cared what them other people do
I'm just hoping maybe I can spend, spend some time with you
I think maybe we, maybe we should just live our life
If you wanna know where I'll be

Then I'll meet you under blue skies, blue skies
We can share the sunshine, sunshine
We going up up, it's going down
We turning up up, it's going down
I'll meet you under blue skies, blue skies
We can share the sunshine, sunshine
We going up up, it's going down
We turning up up, it's going down under blue skies
