You're thinking that you're the king boy

Here it is
Raw form
Taking my time
Making hits, different from the norm
My flows is fire, 
My game's way ahead of my time 
I make moves, Outside The Lines
You know your boys' tryin' to show you the new model
I'm in my zone, going full throttle
You wanna grow up then put up that bottle
It's time to see some of my piers rise up
It's game time who gon' show up clutch, yeah
I went from, good to great
Lukewarm to hot
I'm on top and i can't be stopped
You know they love it when they see ya fall
So pick it up a notch
Go ahead give ‘em what ya got, ya

I see those people that be stylin'
Whiling, social profiling
While in the middle of an opportunity but they childish
How can you become great
When you wanna look the part
But don't do what all it takes
If you want it you gotta go get it
Ain't got no time for people
Telling me their thoughts 
When they talking
But they never did it
You got a vision then you better get after
Cause repetition is crucial
10,000 hours to master
I'm moving on to my next big record to shatter
Living my life like a movie where each moment is captured
You wanna know how I do it, moving up in the ladder?
Because I give it all I got, all the rest doesn't matter
They like

You're thinking that you're the king boy
Well I make it do what it do
Anything you can do
I can do better than you

This a public service announcement
For this generation of mine
They telling us we too young
I'm telling ‘em they behind
The world is for us
Create it, make it and thrive
Whenever they say we're doomed
I'm yelling that we're alive
So step up, I'm showing you a way to go
It's our time, I can feel it, it's about to blow
We got one shot, one chance to show
That we some movers and shakers not the status quo
I'm on fire, everything I touch explodes
So here I go, you are now witnessing' the show
I got a lot to say, even more to grow
And you gon' see me transform from a kid to pro  

You're thinking that you're the king boy
Well I make it do what it do
Anything you can do
I can do better than you
