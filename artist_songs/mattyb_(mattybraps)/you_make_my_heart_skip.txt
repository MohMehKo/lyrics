You are the one I love
You're the dream I dream
And the one I'm believing in
Can't stop having fun
And you make wonder when
I'm gonna see you again
You're like a perfect cool
You're my diamond cut
Breaking all my rules and
So right... can't be wrong
Had to make a song
Written just to you cause

You're like my special someone
Don't know if you are the one
I think we both know we're too young
Oh you drive me crazy
I think your smile's amazing
I've never felt this way before

Cause when I'm with you
There's no place I'd rather be than
Here by your side
Don't you ever forget
That you make my heart skip

Skip skip skip a beat
(you make my heart skip)
Skip skip skip a beat
(you make my heart skip)
Cause when i'm with you
Don't you ever forget
That you make my heart skip

Let's live while we're young
Let's dream our dream
I'll be one of the few that does
Can't stop till we're done
I'mma make you believe that
We're the coolest there ever was
Let's dare risk it all
Let's take what's ours
We'll be over eventually
So right can't be wrong
Had to make a song
And I hope you'll remember me

Whenever you feel lonely
Remember that I'm only
A simple text or call away
And I hope you'll remember
Tell me that you'll remember
I'm thinking 'bout you everyday

Cause when I'm with you
There's no place I'd rather be than
Here by your side
Don't you ever forget
That you make my heart skip

Skip skip skip a beat
(You make my heart skip)
Skip skip skip a beat
(You make my heart skip)
Cause when I'm with you
Don't you ever forget
That you make my heart skip

All around the world
People just like me
With a heart like me
It goes beat, beat, beat, yeah
[repeat]
