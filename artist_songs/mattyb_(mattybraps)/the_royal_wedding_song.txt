[Intro]
All of the girls around the world are saying the same thing
I should - I should be the one to marry prince charming
Now if this won't effect you then know we're the same
But listen up - I made a song in which I'll try to explain (check it out)

[Hook]
Every little girl has the same exact dream
A pretty white dress and a [gasp] diamond ring
To match the biggest wedding ever with a prince for show and tell
To be the princess in his fairy tale
Why is she the one that gets the fairy tale?

[Verse 1]
This might make you laugh but its not a spoof
Everything I raps 100% truth
When a royal wedding happens... here's your proof
Twinky sales go through the rough
And the sorority girls all get excited
But so much jealously... its hard to hide it
All over the news and hurts to look
So one by one they tweet & face book
Saying (uhh) such an issue
I know girlfriend - pass me the tissues
The boys I know all lack in sense
And there she goes just... found a prince!
"real life princess" must be nice
That should be me... it's just not right
It looks so sweet but it feels like a knife
Well she's gonna have a perfect life

[Hook]
Every little girl has the same exact dream
A pretty white dress and a [gasp] diamond ring
To match the biggest wedding ever with a prince for show and tell
To be the princess in his fairy tale
Why is she the one that gets the fairy tale?

[Verse 2]
Now the hardest part is the honey moon
More pictures then they can consume
So the first 3 days they just stay in their rooms
Back and forth - vent and fume and
I don't really care... cause it's not my life
But I mean... they ARE missing paradise
So if you're a guy.... take my advise
The best thing to do is just keep quiet
Don't even try it... crackin' joke
Girls world wide just trying to cope
See they had this dream... and they just lost hope
Save yourselves... let 'em mope
Cause things might seem cool... but there's major problems
Girly stuff.... trust we can't solve 'em
Soon as they showed her in that tiara
KNOW they ALL hit rock bottom

[Bridge]
Before I watch anymore... I'm going to need my diet coke and a tube of cookie dough!

[Hook]
Every little girl has the same exact dream
A pretty white dress and a [gasp] diamond ring
To match the biggest wedding ever with a prince for show and tell
To be the princess in his fairy tale
Every little girl has the same exact dream
A pretty white dress and a [gasp] diamond ring
To match the biggest wedding ever with a prince for show and tell
To be the princess in his fairy tale
Not to worry ladies... I'm available ;)
