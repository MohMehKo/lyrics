That’s what it is, what it is
When you live, tryna keep it low key

You know me, always finding myself in interesting times
Growing up, sharing my stories through these intricate rhymes so check it
I met this dime she looked kinda familiar
But people change with time and I couldn’t remember her so I
Struck up a conversation nothing unusual
But after a couple hours I knew feelings were mutual and I’m
Ready to tell everyone that i know but she like yo, we should keep it on the low
Ought oh, I could see through it and I know how it goes
There's no reason we should be tryna distance anyone close
Especially when we just started having feelings like those
I’ll admit it I was digging her so i just let it go
For a chance at romance I went along with the plans
But then there was a side of me that could see how it would end
But then when you get in it, it can get kinda hard to defend against her
Feminine venom has got me forgetting wisdom again

I don’t want your number
I don’t wanna waste my time
You can have all of your crazy
Cause you’re outta your mind

It's on the low key
Thinking your smooth, foolin everyone else
It’s on the low key
What you don’t know is that you’re playing yourself
It’s on the low key
Nothing but lies that’s coming out of your mouth
It’s on the low key
Sooner or later you’re gonna get found out

Hit me up, said she was begging to chill
Acting cute, nothing suspicious so I’m keeping it real
Thought it might be nice to surprise her and show up at the crib
So I buy her a little present you know something to give 
But get this, I arrive a couple knocks at the door
And her angry father’s expression got me shook to the core
As I slowly begin to ask if she can hang for a few
"I’m confused, I thought she already left with you!"
Huh? So I take off an I’m walking all over town 
I’m trying to keep my cool while I’m looking around
I’ve got an uneasy feeling here that something ain’t right 
but I’m hoping I’m tripping and that we can have a good time
Just as soon as I can find this beautiful girl of mine
She’ll prolly explain that she just lost track of the time
I turn the corner and never expected what I would find
My girl with another guy... tryna keep it low key

I don’t want your number
I don’t wanna waste my time
You can have all of your crazy
Cause you’re outta your mind

It's on the low key
Thinking your smooth, foolin everyone else
It’s on the low key
What you don’t know is that you’re playing yourself
It’s on the low key
Nothing but lies that’s coming out of your mouth
It’s on the low key
Sooner or later you’re gonna get found out

So I kept my composure even though it was over
Sobering in this moment with this unmistakable closure
Going over the moments in my head I lost all my focus 
Now I’m forced to be soldering on, part of my heart broken
No one knows how I felt in that moment I had to walk away
Hate that it’s over you know, I learned the harder way
Smarter to be yourself cause in the end people can see
When you try to try to keep it, try to keep it on the low… key

It's on the low key
Thinking your smooth, foolin everyone else
It’s on the low key
What you don’t know is that you’re playing yourself
It’s on the low key
Nothing but lies that’s coming out of your mouth
It’s on the low key
Sooner or later you’re gonna get found out
