You ready 
Here we go

Get Jazzy on 'em
Pass that mic that I get on...
International
VIP at my concert baby...
sittin' comfortable

But I know what 
the people like
The beat that hits right

I've got gasoline
on my lips like baby
I know I'm
About to ignite

Been around the world
Don't speak the language
But the beat don't need explainin' 
All I ever need to understand is
This music..

Drops dirty to me 
Drops dirty to me
Drops dirty to me
Drops dirty to me

Get Jazzy on em'

I know the words
to your songs
Love how you sing them
We've got this music turnt up
It's like we're screamin' 

But I know what 
the boys they like
A girl that sing nice

I've got gasoline
on my lips like baby
You know I'm
about to ingnite

Been around the 
Don't speak the language
But the beat don't need explainin' 
All I ever need to understand is
This music..

Drops dirty to me 
Drops dirty to me
Drops dirty to me
Drops dirty to me

Uno..
Find a song what we know
Dos...
We can tag team the beat yo
Tres...
Kick the verse back to me tho 
Quatro...

Stay fresh, you know
I don't rest
Sold out shows, 
I be like what's next

Gimmie the mic
I'm known to wreck
Set to set a young exec...
Ha!

International kid on deck
Every picture I take
I pose a threat
Little vet but what
You expect

Beat so sick I had
to pay respect

Anyway everyday
I'mma keep in shinin'
Summertime's mine
told you I keep krindin' 

Anyway everyday
I'mma keep in shinin'
Summertime's mine
told you I keep krindin'

Been around the 
Don't speak the language
But the beat don't need explainin' 
All I ever need to understand is
This music..
