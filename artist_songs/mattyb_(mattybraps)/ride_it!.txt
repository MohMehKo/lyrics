Oh I guess I started something
And now I wont stop for nothing, yeah
I’m gonna ride it till the wheels fall off
No failure ain’t an option
So I’m gonna keep on rocking, yeah
We’re gonna ride it till the wheels fall off

Uh Hum!
Excuse me baby
I don’t hash tag front
I just do me baby
Jack my style but I stay aight
Cause we can wear the same J’s
But you can’t beat Mike (whoope!)
pull up, be like *skiirrt*
in my polo shirt
Just another day back at work
Cause ya boy’s a cert-ified
hustler, ain’t nobody grind like me
you get it in
I’ve done it, who did it first like me? I’m MattyB

The way I do it’s like nobody
They been sleepin but I’m getting what’s mine
and I don’t like to waste my time
So quit lyin
Ain’t nobody even close behind me like woah

Oh I guess I started something
And now I wont stop for nothing, yeah
I’m gonna ride it till the wheels fall off
No failure ain’t an option
So I’m gonna keep on rocking, yeah
We’re gonna ride it till the wheels fall off

Off off, off off off, off off off
We gonna ride it till the wheels fall off

I told ‘em I’d do it
They laughed and said prove it
I proved it and proved it
Don’t need no excuse I don’t play
Pro tip how to gauge your position
When you can’t respond
Cause it’d just bring attention
It’s rare to be different
Especially in a game where everybody
Wanna fall for pretentiousness
I try to tell ‘em but they love to believe
In the hype, the pixie dust
The pipes, the magic beans
So I stay focused keep my head on straight
Make good music that I love
And let the rest keeping hatin’
They gon say he was so cute
I don’t know… he changed
You’re too right
now the young man dominates
I’m like…

The way I do it’s like nobody
They been sleepin but I’m getting what’s mine
and I don’t like to waste my time
So quit lyin
Ain’t nobody even close behind me like woah

Oh I guess I started something
And now I wont stop for nothing, yeah
I’m gonna ride it till the wheels fall off
No failure ain’t an option
So I’m gonna keep on rocking, yeah
We’re gonna ride it till the wheels fall off

Off off, off off off, off off off
We gonna ride it till the wheels fall off

On my way, I’ll take my time
Make the most, get what’s mine
I’ll create what I decide
Coast to coast, stay on my grind
So I don’t care when people talk
No one else can walk my walk
Determined I’mma make my mark
I’ll ride it till the wheels fall off!
(On my way, I’m on my way oh)

I guess I started something
And now I wont stop for nothing, yeah
I’m gonna ride it till the wheels fall off
No failure ain’t an option
So I’m gonna keep on rocking, yeah
We’re gonna ride it till the wheels fall off

Off off, off off off, off off off
We gonna ride it till the wheels fall off

Off off, off off off, off off off
We gonna ride it till the wheels fall off
