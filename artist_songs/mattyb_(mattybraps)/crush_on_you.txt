I got a crush on you, you, you, you, you
you, you, you, you
I got a crush on you

Yo, I got a girl lives down the block
Running through my head but we hardly talk
Beautiful and she caught my eye
The boys break their necks when walks on by
I wanna see if we can kick it awhile
Because I like her style, I wanna make her smile
But I can’t figure out the words to say
and so i hesitate everyday

She’s like everything that I ever wanted
Such a sight to see, man ain’t she something
I never wanna let her get away
And so I gotta stop playing and cut to the chase
Moved a little bit closer
Like I was supposed ta
Think I froze in the moment? No sir!

I got a crush on you
Girl I thought that you knew
I got a crush on you
Now you know that I do
I got a crush on you
Hope you’re digging me too, girl
I got a crush on you
I got a crush on you, you, you, you, you
I got a crush on you, you, you, you
I got a crush on you

All our friends don’t get it
But we don’t sweat it 
She never let me down 
When she’s by my side
We living in a whirl wind of a world
But i got my girl
And that’s enough cause she down ta ride
We like a young Jay-Z and B
MB and she
Wherever I go she’s with me
We got a good thing going
Too much of a feelin’ flowing
You know trust is key
If it’s meant to be, shorty

She’s like everything that I ever wanted
Such a sight to see, man ain’t she something
I never wanna let her get away
And so I gotta stop playing and cut to the chase
Moved a little bit closer
Like I was supposed ta
Think I froze in the moment? No sir!

I got a crush on you
Girl I thought that you knew
I got a crush on you
Now you know that I do
I got a crush on you
Hope you’re digging me too, girl
I got a crush on you
I got a crush on you, you, you, you, you
I got a crush on you, you, you, you
I got a crush on you

Lock on my heart, throw away the key
Throw away the key
Throw away the key
[x3]

I got a crush on you
Girl I thought that you knew
I got a crush on you
Now you know that I do
I got a crush on you
Hope you’re digging me too, girl
I got a crush on you
I got a crush on you, you, you, you, you
I got a crush on you, you, you, you
I got a crush on you
