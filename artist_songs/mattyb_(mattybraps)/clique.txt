Oh yeah, MB!
They love to tell me that I won't amount to nothin' great
I make 'em eat their words cold off my winner plate
I thought I told 'em not to hate back when I was eight
Tissues on my label, oops I mean my table
The same lames hating on my social networks
But when they see me pass they turn so fast their neck hurts
Tonight in all black, straight spit facts, lay hot wax
Forgot I'm Matty Beast Raps and then I'm right back on my pop tracks
Know what I'm talkin bout? You talk a lot, I walk it out
These rumor's like a whirlwind
I'm at the mall taking pictures with your girlfriend
You're busy trash talking I ain't even mad though
I'm busy 'round the country doing mad shows with my clique

Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my, fresher than my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And as I look around they don't do it like my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And when we do it live, man we serve it cold
we serve it cold, we serve it cold, we serve it cold

Ok so MattyB's the king, well I'mma be the princess
Hanging with the flyest kids you can clique with
No matter how we kick it you know that we flip it well
I go by the name Nyielle and I'm from the ATL shawty
Represent your clique, your posse and your crew
In my city making hit music's what we do
Don't talk about it, we just cool
Ain't finished till our work's through
When we ain't at school, we make major moves
We're on top of the world with nothing to prove
We do it big 'cause we like to dream
Join the team or just gossip like a drama queen
The truth I gotta be - Dance, act, sing
Triple threat with 16, I'm quadrupling
You so produced, we homemade
It's obvious and we know
We going in with MattyB it's like we shooting free throws
The flyest shows you've ever seen
With good music that's banging
While these haters remain nameless
They mad that they ain't hanging with the clique

Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my, fresher than my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And as I look around they don't do it like my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And when we do it live, man we serve it cold
we serve it cold, we serve it cold, we serve it cold

Here I go, as I spit a verse that's so impeccable
Check the flow, even when they wanna slow me down
Know the crown is my big end goal
Town to town, searching for a sound I think's incredible
Expect a full verse other MCs can find respectable
This... is... the lesson, we ain't even started
The next 10 years we bout to go harder
and farther than other's have bothered at my age
Because we work hard before we go play
I'll build a kid nation with God on my own
Like a young Jay-Z they watching my throne, uh
Took a dream I had in my bedroom
To a screen in front of your eyes
To a stage with my B Family
Now watch me take it worldwide
No recognition, I've been too young for this
To everybody who is yet to take my serious
I've got the best fans watching right here
Pretty soon you'll have to look at my career
and you're gonna wish you was in my clique

Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my, fresher than my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And as I look around they don't do it like my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And when we do it live, man we serve it cold
we serve it cold, we serve it cold, we serve it cold
