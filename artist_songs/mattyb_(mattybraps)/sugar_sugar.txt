Everybody move your head like this, like this
Everybody move your head like this, like this
Everybody move your head like this
This the type of beat that I know you can't resist
I know you can't resist when my 808 hits
Makes you want to move to my beat like this
When I drop a flow it's like sugar on my lips
Matty on the beat so it's infectious
I just wanna hit, wanna hit with my lips
They just wanna hit with their fist but they miss
Haters stay mad cause my feet stay crisp
And my hits stay big cause I do it like this, like
All the girlies love me and they wanna blow a kiss
But I tell 'em no thanks cause I'm just a little kid
Just a little kid, just a, just a little kid
Just a little kid with a hit like this

Sugar sugar sugar
How you do it like this
Do it like this, do it, do it like this (like)
Sugar sugar sugar
How you do it like this
You just made a hit, made a hit
And it tastes like

Sugar sugar sugar I'm a kid with some nice dreams
I scream you scream for the right team
Got a little swag, must have come attached
You already know, jeans with the sour patch
Catch me at the mall on the second floor, Ballin'
Drop my piggy bank on the candy store
(you know I'm) Rockin' out, talkin' loud
They call me Ludacris just from my "Word of Mouth"
See I'm from the South, ATL
Where we rock them beats just cause we do it well
Jermaine Dupree, BoB, Dre' 3, TIP, MattyB
Something like a pro
Get up out your seats - hit the dance floor
Hit the dance floor - hit the, hit the dance floor
Get up out your seats - dance like a pro

Check out my new dance, I call it the (sugar) (rush)
Plus gotta bottle up - Drink up my new soda pop MattyB Crush (crush, crush)
Got a MattyB (crush) while doing the (sugar) (rush) the (sugar) is too much!
It ain't nothin' but a B thing
Drive 'em crazy like sugar on a keychain
Drive 'em crazy playin Sugar on the freeway
Super sweet so we sayin' "Go DJ"
Go DJ, go DJ - sugar beat now you're playin' what we play
At the 10, at the 5 what, where the replay
Candy hook, one more time, what do we say?
