MattyB rock rock rock... rock with it
Girl you're my number one and you know we be having fun
You already know what's up and you're the only one that I want
Lets go now

[Chorus:]
Will you be mine (yeah yeah yeah)
Be my sunshine (yeah yeah yeah)
Girl you stole my heart 
Right from the start (hey)
You're my sunshine
Will you be mine

Yo MB
You the kind of girl that I like
You're so cute, so fresh and your style is tight and I'm
A bit smitten but I'll stay polite
Cause if you say ok then I'mma treat you right girl
Look shorty you're the only one and though I know we're young
I wanna have some fun
We hit the avenue flashin the flyest fashion till we don't go no more
Hit the movies after (uh)
My hearts beating at a faster pace
When I see your smile, you've got an angel face, I wanna
Know how I can make your day
I want a photo of the two of us with memories made, riiiight?
I'm making music like I ought to be
Then cupid shoots another one of those little darts in me
It throws me for a loop and then pretty soon I'm talking stupid
Walking back and forth conflicted acting forward listen

You are the one I like, out of all the girls I see
I really wanna make you mine cause you're the only girl for me, saying

[Chorus]

So let it be known I'd rather be wrong
Than miss my only opportunity and leave you alone, I gotta
Make you mine, it's obvious that probably just
God spent a little more time... on you
And everything you do, I must confess it's a blessing to 
Know that somebody like you has chosen the right move
I'm hoping I might prove I'm open inspired through
A token a write you
My hearts beatin' like the song I sing and when you pass me by
I see you're angel wings, I wanna
Know how I can make you feel like you're the only girl cause what I say is real
So hit me with it, let's cut to the chase
Only so much a roller coaster my heart can take
Going up and down over mountains I start to pace
Turning red in the face, it's love, I rest my case now break

You are the one I like, out of all the girls I see
I really wanna make you mine cause you're the only girl for me, saying

[Chorus x2]

Girl you're my number one and you know we be having fun
You already know what's up and you're the only one that I want
Rock rock rock, rock with it
girl you're my number one and you know we be having fun
you already know what's up and you're the only one that I want
let's go now

[Chorus]
