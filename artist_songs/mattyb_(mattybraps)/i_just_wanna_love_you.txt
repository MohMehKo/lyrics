Crazy, dizzy, stupid in love, can't control it
I'm usually the king of composed, a true fella
But I'm, under her love like a, an umbrella

I said oh, tell me where did you go
I fell in love with the vision of the girl I saw
What's your name, shorty, I gotta know
I said oh, come and give me a sign
Because a girl like you, deserves a boy
That'll promise to treat you right

So tell me are you out there
With the pretty blonde hair
Cause I've been looking for ya
I can't find you anywhere, say yeah, say yeah
Cause I just wanna love you
[Repeat]

I just wanna love you [x4]

I know there's
Dudes who treat her well
I'd treat her better
She Gone With the Wind
Like she blend with the weather
Whether she's hot like fire
Just a glance, she gone
Or turns cold, I don't know where she goes, nope
Little thieve of sorts
Lookin' for more
Missy â€“ Steals my heart
With that look I adore
She's my beauty queen, #1 on my team
The leading lady for me, way out of ya league

I said oh, tell me where did you go
I fell in love with the vision of the girl I saw
What's your name, shorty, I gotta know
I said oh, come and give me a sign
Because a girl like you, deserves a boy
That'll promise to treat you right

So tell me are you out there
With the pretty blonde hair
Cause I've been looking for ya
I can't find you anywhere, say yeah, say yeah
Cause I just wanna love you
[Repeat]

I just wanna love you [x4]

So where you at
Look around the world and then I double back for you, for you
So where you at
Look around the world and then I double back for you, for you

So tell me are you out there
With the pretty blonde hair
Cause I've been looking for ya
I can't find you anywhere, say yeah, say yeah
Cause I just wanna love you
[Repeat]
