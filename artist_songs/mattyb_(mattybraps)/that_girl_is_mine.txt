The way she moves her feet
Tell the other fellas that this girl is mine
The way she groves to that beat
All the girls are jealous that this girl is mine

Now here's a story 'bout the way it went down
See I was hearing 'bout the people talking way over town
Said there's a place that you can visit but you gotta be rad
Cause they wouldn't let you on the dance floor unless you've got swag
And so I, I, I stepped to the door in a hurry
Tipped the bouncer told him that he need not to worry
The room was thick, everybody was fly
But then I saw this little cutie out the corner of my eye

Look at her go
Look at her proving that I can't take it
I just wanna dance with her
She knows she cold
Knows how to kill it on the dance floor

The way she moves her feet
Tell the other fellas that this girl is mine
The way she groves to that beat
All the girls are jealous that this girl is mine

So now I'm smitten she could tell by my eyes
But I was cooler than a penguin in a bucket of ice
A moment of hesitiation cause I felt butterflies
But I decided to approach her quick and swallow my pride
And so I, I, I walked for what seemed like a mile
Was taken by surprise when she looked at me and smiled
I said I like your moves, I think that you're fly
She said I really really really wanna zig-a-zig ahhh

Look at her go
Look at her proving that I can't take it
I just wanna dance with her
She knows she cold
Knows how to kill it on the dance floor

The way she moves her feet
Tell the other fellas that this girl is mine
The way she groves to that beat
All the girls are jealous that this girl is mine

She can talk the talk
But what I really dig's how she walks the walk
Actin' out the sound
Hands in the air when the song breaks down said
Ohh

Look at her go
Look at her proving that I can't take it
I just wanna dance with her
She knows she cold
Knows how to kill it on the dance floor

The way she moves her feet
Tell the other fellas that this girl is mine
The way she groves to that beat
All the girls are jealous that this girl is mine

The way she moves her feet
Tell the other fellas that this girl is mine
The way she groves to that beat
All the girls are jealous that this girl is mine
