Hey!
Baby don’t you worry ‘bout tomorrow
Give it all that you got
Cause some days are gonna feel super hard yo
No matter what you can’t stop (can’t stop)
No no no
We gon make it to the top
One day we gon make it to the top (to the top hey!)
Cause we gon make it to the top
One day we gon make it to the top (to the top hey!)

Yo
Ain’t got a nickel to my name
A pocket full of sand
Yeah this is where I’m at
Got a dream to be the man
Though I don’t like what I see
I don’t know how to change it
Try to fix my problems
But I only rearrange ‘em
I try ta keep it moving
I keep it moving
with all the drama keep improving
I keep improving
I see ‘em watching what I’m doing
What I’m pursuing
I-I don’t mind
Hands dirty cause I’m working all the time

It starts with a passion
Put it into action
I’mma stay fly-i-i-i never average
Gotta be the best cause even under the stress
I’m focused on today, I ain’t worried ‘bout the rest man
(you know it)

I’ve got some things here to accomplish
Now I’ve fallen more than once
But I brush the dust
Strap these haters to a rocket
Gotta send ‘em into space
Or put ‘em back in their place
Cause I’m back on it
I keep grinding and keep writing
Next to my name, It’s gonna read "The Teen Titan”
Lyrical blows that I keep throwing like Mike Tyson
Determined to go all 12 rounds in my life man

It starts with a passion
Put it into action
I’mma stay fly-i-i-i never average
Gotta be the best cause even under the stress
I’m focused on today, I ain’t worried ‘bout the rest man
(you know it)
