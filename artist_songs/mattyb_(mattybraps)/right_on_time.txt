Thinkin’ bout my life
I was looking out for myself alright
Never mind looking over my shoulder
At another brother who could be down
And in the middle of a fight
Plus I got these brand new kicks I like
Why would I walk a mile in his shoes
They scuffed and bruised
I guess the truth is
It would be easy to judge another
When you see they’re going through a tough time

Then the storm clouds come
And the rain pours out
And the roof caves in
I can see no longer
And the way that my heart once felt
Makes room for the change
As my faith grows stronger
All I need is a spark to come alive
I can’t see it but there’s light on the inside
Hands up cause I’m down in the fight
But it’s in that moment that I finally realize

I was holding on to nothing and to no one
And then you came and shook up my life
The clock was ticking slow
And I had nowhere to go
You picked me up and kept me alive
Right on time
Right on time
Right on time
Right on time

I look at life with new eyes
And see things that I would otherwise
Choose to cruise by
Turn the blind eye
Whether abused, confused
I would view that to stop
Would be a waste of my time
I was thinking bout me
Now I think about you
All the pain you must feel
All the things you’ve been through
And you had a bad day
Maybe I can relate
Come and take my hand
We can walk this way
They say

That the storm clouds come
And the rain pours out
And the roof caves in
You can see no longer
And the way that my heart once felt
Done changed and I know
My faith is stronger
All you need is a spark to come alive
You can’t see it but there’s light on the inside
Hands up and you’re back in the fight
Cause you can’t let go and give up on your life

I was holding on to nothing and to no one
And then you came and shook up my life
The clock was ticking slow
And I had nowhere to go
You picked me up and kept me alive
Right on time
Right on time
Right on time
Right on time
Oh right on time
Oh right on time

Now what’s it hurt
To lend a hand to somebody in need
Now what’s it hurt
To be a friend, instead always just thinking bout me
Now what’s it hurt
To make the right choice, and try to spread love in a world of hate 
Now what’s it hurt
To do my part and try to make the world a better place

I was holding on to nothing and to no one
And then you came and shook up my life
The clock was ticking slow
And I had nowhere to go
You picked me up and kept me alive
Right on time
Right on time
Right on time
Right on time
Oh right on time
Right on time
