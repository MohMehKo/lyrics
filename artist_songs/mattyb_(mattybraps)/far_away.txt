Oh, every time you come around me
Every time you come around me
Oh, every time
You come around
Stay far away, stay far away

I met a bad chick
She was flawless from head to toe
I never would of imagined that she would do me low
With her mad tricks
Playing games stacking the cards
Hiding her inner monster then stabbing me in the heart
I’m a maverick
But this woman’s like an outlaw
Good will overcome evil and she’s about to get outdrawn
One of the greatest stories ever been told
The summer was scorching hot
But the winter was frigid cold

Did you think that you could play me
Well I’m not playing anymore

Oh, every time you come around me
Every time you come around me
Oh, every time
You come around
Stay far away, stay far away

Lying, stalking my messages, trying to clip my wings
These are just a few of her favorite things
Setting me up, building me high to let me fall
Tell me where all you’ve been today
Who is it that you’ve called
Why don’t you ever talk to me
Look what you put me through
Look what you made me do!
Enough is enough
Call it off, over, we’re through
I’ve had so much of your crazy
But I’m not going to go crazy too

Did you think that you could play me
Well I’m not playing anymore

Oh, every time you come around me
Every time you come around me
Oh, every time
You come around
Stay far away, stay far away
