I don’t need any guarantees
Or them to tell me who I’m s’posed to be
I’m dreaming up my possibilities
I need faith mixed with some patience

The youngest brother, started out real low
A little smaller so they told me no
But I’m fighter so its time to show
That it ain’t that complicated (no)

Dreaming in the sky
Every day and every night
Tell the doubters goodbye
You’ve gotta live your own life

So many people wanna tell me no
But I’m courageous even on my own
I’m going hard - I’m not going home
I feel like David with the rolling stone

The quicker they rise
The quicker they fall
Feels like I could slay giants high as 10 feet tall
No goliath too big
No stone too small
Feels like I could slay giants high as 10 feet tall
Goliath oh oh
Goliath oh no
Feels like I could slay giants high as 10 feet tall
Goliath oh oh
Goliath oh no
Feels like I could slay giants high as 10 feet tall

I’ll never make it on your stereo
Is what they’ve told me’s the scenario
A little young so they told me no
But I can’t let another second pass due to a delay

Cause even when the odds are slim
At the – end of the tunnel and the light is dim
I’ll make my way out of this lions den
And I’m ‘gon slay those giants on my way

Dreaming in the sky
Every day and every night
Tell the doubters goodbye
You’ve gotta live your own life

So many people wanna tell me no
But I’m courageous even on my own
I’m going hard – I’m not going home
I feel like David with the rolling stone

The quicker they rise
The quicker they fall
Feels like I could slay giants high as 10 feet tall
No goliath too big
No stone too small
Feels like I could slay giants high as 10 feet tall
Goliath oh oh
Goliath oh no
Feels like I could slay giants high as 10 feet tall
Goliath oh oh
Goliath oh no
Feels like I could slay giants high as 10 feet tall

On the mic like I’m winding my sling
I slayed the lion, even took the bear in my sleep
While tendin’ sheep – now standing in this moment of truth
Like a kid with the rock – MattyB in the booth
As time stops, heart beating like a drum my chest
I’m fearless, yeah, not afraid to walk in my destiny
This moment, like a story told in a scene
From a kid with dream to becoming the king, yeah!

The quicker they rise
The quicker they fall
Feels like I could slay giants high as 10 feet tall
No goliath too big
No stone too small
Feels like I could slay giants high as 10 feet tall
Goliath oh oh 
Goliath oh no
Feels like I could slay giants high as 10 feet tall
Goliath oh oh
Goliath oh no
Feels like I could slay giants high as 10 feet tall
