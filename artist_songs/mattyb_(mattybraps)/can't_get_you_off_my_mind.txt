Waking up this morning with a lot of my mind
Ain't feeling the same since that dream last night
We were all having the time of our lives then reality strikes, strikes
Lately I've been wishing I could change with the time
I'd be lying if I said you ain't on my mind
I start calling you then hanging up
And going out and playing tough
And then something will remind me of you

I just can't get you off my mind
Thinking 'bout you lately
Memories you left behind
Oh, they drive me crazy
I'mma be just fine (just fine)
I just can't get you off my mind
Gotta get you off my mind
Tell me if you found yourself somebody new
I see them other girls, but girl they ain't you
Girl it's driving me insane, can't get you off of my brain
No, I ain't lying, the harder and harder I try
I just can't get you off my mind

Feeling hot, then feeling cold
Tryna act like I'm supposed to
Feeling high then I'm feeling so low
Up and down like a roller coaster
It blew by too fast - whirlwind
She graduated from my buddy to my girlfriend
Said I would act too tough, but stuck to my guns
And then she said the three words
You know the ones
I made her laugh till we both felt breathless, huh
She used to say that the fame won't effect us, huh
I probably spent too much on her necklace but
What you expect, a little young and reckless
You know the feeling when you break up
Then wake up
And see they posted pictures of em out having fun
And you wondering if they think about you
Like you think about 'em
And suddenly you in love again like what have I done? Uh!
I guess we changed too much
Without a doubt
We was a match but the flame finally burned out
And now I'm wishing that time would be kind and rewind cause

I just can't get you off my mind
Thinking 'bout you lately
Memories you left behind
Oh, they drive me crazy
I'mma be just fine (just fine)
I just can't get you off my mind
Gotta get you off my mind
Tell me if you found yourself somebody new
I see them other girls, but girl they ain't you
Girl it's driving me insane, can't get you off of my brain
No, I ain't lying, the harder and harder I try
I just can't get you off my mind

It's hard enough just trying to pass the time
Baby I can't get you off my mind

I just can't get you off my mind
Thinking 'bout you lately
Memories you left behind
Oh, they drive me crazy
I'mma be just fine (just fine)
I just can't get you off my mind
Gotta get you off my mind
Tell me if you found yourself somebody new
I see them other girls, but girl they ain't you
Girl it's driving me insane, can't get you off of my brain
No, I ain't lying, the harder and harder I try
I just can't get you off my mind
