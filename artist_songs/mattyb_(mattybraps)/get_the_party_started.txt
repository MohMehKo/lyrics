[Brooke & Carissa:]
I’m coming up
So you better get the party started
(I’m coming up said I’m coming)
I’m coming up 
So you better get the party started

[MattyB:]
Yo, MB in the place to be
we on top, can’t slow can’t hold me down
but you done, hit play a few billion times
and so I’m back with a brand new sound
I be, coast to coast, across the globe
and ignite when we come through your city or town
but yo, check the crew, 100 proof
I got the hottest teen label around
It’s a new day, 
I’m showing you the new way
online man, get with the times
So if your passions right
and your fashions tight 
you just might get signed
keep trying, the game’s mine

[Brooke & Carissa:]

[Madison:]
These boys just talk a lot
But us girls we do our thing

[Sierra:]
Hold up, you didn’t even introduce yourself

[Olivia:]
She’s right!

[Madison:]
How rude of me

[Graice:]
Well we're 4 sisters from the coast
and we dance and rap and sing
make music just for fun
and we put up with MattyB!

[Sierra:]
I’m not a material girl
But I could use a shopping spree!

[Olivia:]
Got style, got class, got attitude
I’m like, no pictures please, cheese!
