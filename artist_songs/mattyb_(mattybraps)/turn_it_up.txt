Turn it up, this is my jam
Put 'em high
I wanna see your hands
[x4]

They call me MattyB, I got the game on lock
Super swag haters mad but I still won't stop
I be rocking these shows, bass hitting low
You already know now take a pic on your iPhone
Give me the mic, I'm gonna rip that 
Hit like a bat, knock it out the park 
Ain't no way you gonna get it back
I know I'm just a kid but I got flow
like an episode when I upload that
Make your head spin when I get it in
Make everybody re..re.. rewind that
Rap so sick, yeah I got this
Matty can't miss and that's a fact,
Make the bass go

Boom boom boom boom
Make it go boom
Boom boom boom boom
Shake the whole room
Boom boom boom boom
Turn it up loud
Boom boom boom boom
I know you like my style
Break it down now

Turn it, shake it, pump it up, just make them speakers go..go boom
(they go boom, aight)
[x4]

I can flip this frontwards, flip this backwards
It don't matter flow so absurd
Blow your speakers 
Yes sir for sure
Rocking the beat that word to your mother
If this your jam (this your jam)
Then pump your hands (pump your hands)
Turn it up scream as loud as you can
Put your game face on when you playing this song
When that bass hit low it'll make go numb
You will never be the be the same
I'm hot (hot) like a flame
What more can I say 
MattyB I done change the game
Now make the bass go boom

Boom boom boom boom
Make it go boom
Boom boom boom boom
Shake the whole room
Boom boom boom boom
Turn it up loud
Boom boom boom boom
I know you like my style

Turn it, shake it, pump it up, just make them speakers go go boom
(they go boom, aight)
[x4]

Boom boom boom boom
Make it go boom
Boom boom boom boom
Shake the whole room
Boom boom boom boom
Turn it up loud
Boom boom boom boom
I know you like my style
