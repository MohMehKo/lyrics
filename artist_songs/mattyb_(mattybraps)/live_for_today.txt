They say that we reckless
They say we can't do it our own way
They can't promise tomorrow
So let's live for today
They love to have no fun (no fun)
We love to make stops along the way
They can't promise tomorrow
So let's live for today
Now if ya with me say oh...
And if ya with me say oh...

So why don't you do YOU cause I'mma be ME
Lemme prophesy what the future gon be
Making moves like this, while they looking like that
Couple billion in now er'body think they rap
What you talkin' bout, Matt? (ha!)
Nothin but the end zone
Started up a label now I'm putting all of my friends on 
Writing my own theme songs, kid with a dream songs
Yeah right, like I've ever been up in the friend zone
Matty be my boyfriend? baby that's a no ma'am
I'm about to go ham, they say that I glowed up so much compared To my old jams
But this is for my old fans, this is for my true fam, with me through and through man
Doing what it do fam, ye ye
Everybody signed to majors
I keep building my sky scraper
Brick by brick keeping stacking layers
Flow like you can taste the flavor
Haters think they still darth vador
So I press their buttons like a little kid on elevators 

They say that we reckless
They say we can't do it our own way
They can't promise tomorrow
So let's live for today
They love to have no fun
We love to make stops along the way
They can't promise tomorrow
So let's live for today
Now if ya with me say oh...
And if ya with me say oh...

So why don't we take a trip down memory lane
I was 6 or 7 with some music on my brain
I ain't know what I was doing so I just bang bang on my books
And I sang every hook, it was strange all the looks
But it didn't matter to me like whatever I'mma do me
I would listen in amazement, study in the basement 
Put that criticism on my back cause I can take it
Grinding with my craft, in the lab being patient
Face it, pace it, till I make progression
That ain't insta fame man, that's a thousand sessions
Homie I'm in beast mode, raw baby, I've been through it all, I ain't worried bout y'all 
Now I see 'em out there trying so hard not to admit it
But deep inside they feeling what I'm spitting's
Kinda hard hitting, no wait a minute
What am I saying, who am I kidding
He grew up and got sick wit it

They say that we reckless
They say we can't do it our own way
They can't promise tomorrow
So let's live for today
They love to have no fun (no fun)
We love to make stops along the way
They can't promise tomorrow
So let's live for today
Now if ya with me say oh...
And if ya with me say oh...

Cause when they tell us that we gotta move this way
We say no way, no way
And when they tell us that we gotta sound that way
We say no way, no way
And when they tell us who we gotta be
Don't ya know that we say no way, no way
Cause I'mma live my life being who I am so I say no way, no way

They say that we reckless
They say we can't do it our own way
They can't promise tomorrow
So let's live for today
They love to have no fun (no fun)
We love to make stops along the way
They can't promise tomorrow
So let's live for today
Now if ya with me say oh...
And if ya with me say oh...

They say that we reckless
They say we can't do it our own way
They can't promise tomorrow
So let's live for today
