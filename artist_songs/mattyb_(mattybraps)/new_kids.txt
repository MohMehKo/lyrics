Take my hand I'll show you where we play
Where rules are bent this is our getaway
We're screaming yeah
The future is now go ahead and get loud
We're screaming yeah
The new kids around, cause this is our town
Our town, our town

Welcome to bottom of the map
Where we young and we hungry, us kids don't play
And I rep for the city that I come from
ATL I was born and raised
And I talk that talk
Cause I walk that walk
I was taught to work hard get paid
Spit wild freestyles on the playground
While making mad girls look my way
So hey, whatcha know bout young man
With a plan to make a new way
Through breaking every obstacle thrown in his way
Still breaking records and doing it at a new pace
Can't touch what you can't see but us the new kids, we be
That freshman class but it's kinda backwards
Cause I'm teaching half of these head masters new things
Never EXTRA credit, if I want it then I get on the mic and get it
Better read that inspirational sign
In the back that says "skies the limit"
School is now in session
For your first lesson, "talk is cheap"
Better put that pen to the pad
And scribble out your thoughts till your fingers bleed

Take my hand I'll show you where we play
Where rules are bent this is our getaway
We're screaming yeah
The future is now go ahead and get loud
We're screaming yeah
The new kids around, cause this is our town
Our town, our town

It's what I live for
Fight for, rap these songs I write for
I get loved and criticized for
But I'm a keep working at my title
Cause ain't nobody can say
That you can never have heart and be great
You keep on believing work hard everyday
You take a dream and go far graduate
We get a vision in our head and we run away
To a place where we safe and we can create
With no time for any hate, it'd take away from
What we trying to do, so keep your head straight
Cause you can do it if you put your mind to it and
Never let another belittle what you're doing
When nobody else is around, because
Either you're up or your on your way to winning
But you keep critiquing your own beautiful sound
We them new kids, that freshman class
Them prospects, with attitude
And we world changers
Earth shakers you don't understand the magnitude
We're billions, brilliant
With technology, on the cutting edge
And we're coming at you full steam ahead
But I'm looking back at my art stretched like

Take my hand I'll show you where we play
Where rules are bent this is our getaway
We're screaming yeah
The future is now go ahead and get loud
We're screaming yeah
The new kids around, cause this is our town
Our town, our town
