[Matty:]
Matty Gangnam style
Gangnam style
People stop and ask why I'm so fly when they walk past me
I've got this Gangnam fever, now I'm dressing super flashy
In New York, yes, the city known for making heavy hitters
Introduce you to my babysitters

[Christina:]
No control

[Lisa:]
This kid is literally off the deep end

[Lauren:]
All that we were told was simply watch him for the weekend

[Katherine:]
Everything this kid is doing is like on some other level

[Amy:]
Hey, wait! Grab him before he gets in trouble 

[Matty:]
Mighty empire
Once Jay-Z's empire
No longer his
I run this biz

[Dani:]
Here's the stair door

[Amy and Lauren:]
We'll all be done for

[Lisa:]
Yeah, hold up, wait

[Christina:]
There's just no way

[Lauren:]
A New York City building?
Girl, you must be cray

[Matty:]
Matty Gangnam style
Gangnam style
Matty Gangnam style
Gangnam style

Hey, can't persuade me
Matty Gangnam style

[Cimorelli:]
Wait, Matty, baby

[Matty:]
No, no, no, no, no

Walking along just with my feet, I'm feeling fancy
I spot another gentleman who thinks he can out-dance me
He's got style in his blood, but, sir, I wouldn't wanna be ya
When I Gangnam like in South Korea

[Lauren:]
What in the world is Mattyâ€“

[Katherine:]
That did not just happen

[Christina:]
Get over here or else we're grounding you from rapping

[Amy:]
This fiasco is over!

[Lisa:]
We're serious, not another chance

[Dani:]
I mean, I kind of wanna learn the dance

[Matty:]
You so get me
It's so addictive

[Katherine:]
He just can't quit! 

[Dani:]
It looks legit
Can you teach us? 

[Christina, Katherine, Lisa, Amy, and Lauren:]
You can't be serious! 

[Matty:]
Yes, it goes right, then it goes left
Then it goes right-right 
Now reverse the steps!

[Lauren:]
Oh, Cimorelli Gangnam style
Gangnam style
Cimorelli Gangnam style
Gangnam style

[Cimorelli:]
Hey, can't persuade us 

[Matty:]
How we Gangnam style

[Cimorelli:]
Somebody save us

[Matty:]
No, no, no, no, no 

That's our Gangnam style
