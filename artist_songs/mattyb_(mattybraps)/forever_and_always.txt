Dream what you wanna dream
Go where you wanna go
Love who you need to love
Know what you wanna know

Think what you're gonna think
Say what you're gonna say
Be who you wanna be
Forever and always

Who says it matters what my age is?
Don't we all grow up to be the same kids?
Same book, same story, different pages
Always chasing after new rages
Always chasing after new wages
So we can all rest better through the ages
Uh.. no need for an occasion
When I'm on the mic I serve it hotter than the Cajuns
California bathing - while naysayers eatin' California raisins
Said I'm an animal with braces, tell all these haters to go back to their cages
Do it big and outrageous, I can tell you were destined for greatness
Yeah, and if we in the same places
I just wanna see both of your hands grab space ships

Dream what you wanna dream
Go where you wanna go
Love who you need to love
Know what you wanna know
Think what you're gonna think
Say what you're gonna say
Be who you wanna be
Forever and always

Forever is a long time
Especially since forever never rewinds
That's why you gotta stay on top of your grind
You'll find I take time with every single line I rhyme
I'm almost 9 and I'm boxing with the sands of time
To be the greatest rapper ever is a dream of mine
I guess the future's still left to be defined
I'll quit the game before i get assigned to ride the pine
Yeah - I'm just trying to have the right mind
A lot of people like to talk from the side lines
Living life like they afraid of the blind side
But I can see the field through my minds eyes
But I'm keep on spraying till my rhymes ride
'Till I can see my words make your eyes wide
Uh - buckled in for the long ride
'Till I can rock a mic and make a song cry

Dream what you wanna dream
Go where you wanna go
Love who you need to love
Know what you wanna know
Think what you're gonna think
Say what you're gonna say
Be who you wanna be
Forever and always

On my final cut, even though this song will age it won't grow up
Forever and always - reminding me of my second grade hallways
Reminding me of the days when my rap first
Came down like rain through the third verse
Splashed the waters and made your ears thirst
Then lit up the sky to make the heavens burst
Then the clouds broke from above
This must be the feeling that they call love
No exaggeration, that's how I feel making music for my generation
So I hope that you'll take it
And not let another replace it
And keep an open mind when you play it
And as you listen you'll feel what I'm saying... I'm saying

[x2]
Dream what you wanna dream
Go where you wanna go
Love who you need to love
Know what you wanna know
Think what you're gonna think
Say what you're gonna say
Be who you wanna be
Forever and always
