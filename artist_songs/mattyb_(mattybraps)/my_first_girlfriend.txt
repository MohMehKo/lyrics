Do I know you cause you, you
Look a lot like
My first girlfriend
My first girlfriend
Babygirl you, you
Look a lot like

Aye yo I'm looking for that right girl
Shorty be my best friend
Lock on my heart
But I'm hoping I can let her in
Though I know we young
Maybe someone I'll be better with
Let ya wear my jacket down the hall
Like the cutest little letterman
Might be a pro I'm certainly no veteran
Sharing these thoughts like an open love letter and
I wonder if we'll know it's love at first sight
Or if these kind of feelings take flight
Or maybe you'll be hiding out
I can see you somewhere in the crowd
Hoping that one day we'll find out
Or maybe you'll on the front row screaming loud at my show
And I'll meet you with a smile and a rose
Or maybe back home, a friend of someone I already know
And this is something for you that I wrote
And I mean every note
I wonder if you feel the same too
And I just wanna see if it's true
Do I know you cause you

Do I know you cause you, you
Look a lot like
My first girlfriend
My first girlfriend
Babygirl you, you
Look a lot like
My first girlfriend
My first girlfriend

You've got my heart beating like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You've got my heart beating like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Do I know you cause you, you
Look a lot like
My first girlfriend
My first girlfriend

Girl you can be my shorty
My senorita
My little lady
I just wanna meet ya
What's it gonna take now
For me to find you
Cause you never do know
When you'll find someone that you love
(uh) and i just wanna be there
Close my eyes I'm dreaming
And suddenly you appear
I may be talking crazy
But maybe it's in the air
Cause I'm thinking bout you daily
And I don't r-really care
What it takes now
Name a city and I'll be there
On my way out
Yeah, consider me in the air
When it rains now
Sit by my window and say a prayer
That you're safe out
Happy and living without a care
And I'm hopeful
That what I'm feeling you feel too
Cause life without you's like
A month without food
A one without a two
No fun to go through
And I just wanna see if it's true
Do I know you cause you

Do I know you cause you, you
Look a lot like
My first girlfriend
My first girlfriend
Babygirl you, you
Look a lot like
My first girlfriend
My first girlfriend

You've got my heart beating like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You've got my heart beating like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Do I know you cause you, you
Look a lot like
