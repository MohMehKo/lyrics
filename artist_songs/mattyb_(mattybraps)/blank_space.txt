If you love something and it’s true
Then they say you should let it go
Might rip you to little pieces
But when it comes back you know
Told you I do
But I think it’s best I lay low
Plus I can’t explain these cuties
Here texting me on my phone
Oh my my, look at that face…
Gotta try my hardest not to make a mistake
Try the single life for a change
Get these numbers erased
Only ladies that I’ll be calling’s my momma and Sarah Grace
Now I’mma focus on my first love
and tell these shorties my music is something they ain’t above
This the last time
I put cuties over my rhymes
The times are changing its strange
But I’m focused, I feel amazing man
I’ll text, “So hey, let’s be friends!
I’m dying to meet. I’m such a fan!”
Ok everything I said I take it back.
What?
You really think I’d pass on a face like that? psshhh

So it’s gonna be forever
Or it’s gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it’s over
If my heart was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-others
They’ll tell you I’m insane
But you know I love the players
And you love the game
Cause we’re young and we’re restless
I’ll take this way too far
It’ll leave you helpless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-others
They’ll tell you I’m insane
But I’ve got a blank space baby
And I’ll write your name

So what’s a young type love like me ‘sposed to do
I gave this girl my heart even tho I said I’m through
Now she telling me I caught her
But I think I caught the flu
cause I can’t stop (cough) (cough) (sneeze)!
And her fingers looked crossed
When she said “Bless you”
Now my legs are like spaghetti
From the heavy Ragu
Either there's something in the sauce
Or I’m sweating from the food
I ain’t tryna be rude
But Miss Crazy we’re through (oh no)
She got me stumbling fumbling on my way to the door
Vision blurry, and so I’m hurrying and praying Dear Lord
Let me make it out of this trap
This black widow and web
All the while I can hear something
Maybe it’s just my head
But I fight and I scrap
Although I wanna collapse
But I won’t give her the
Satisfaction she’s after
with that I look back 
before it all goes black she screams,
“Darling I’m a nightmare,
Dressed like a daydream!”

So it’s gonna be forever
Or it’s gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it’s over
If my heart was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-others
They’ll tell you I’m insane
But you know I love the players
And you love the game
Cause we’re young and we’re restless
I’ll take this way too far
It’ll leave you helpless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-others
They’ll tell you I’m insane
But I’ve got a blank space baby
And I’ll write your name
