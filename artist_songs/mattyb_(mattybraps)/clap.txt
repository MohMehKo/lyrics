Make Your Hands Clap
You ready, make your hands clap
Here we got [x5]
You want a slow song
Mr. nice guy
I ain't all that, I'm just superfly
Where my shades at?
Lights is too bright
You can be the Star, I'ma gonna be the night sky
They say I'm too young, for  my silver tongue
Like creating a monster, what have I done?
You think it's over like Kobe, I bounce back
When I rap that, Imma make 'en clap back 
Let the beat build, you ant gonna dance
I'm just tired of everybody sitting on their hands
Bend your elbows, look around the room, then stop
Now make your hands clap

Make your hands clap
Make your hands clap
Ready for round two, this ain't a sequal
Like a movement of all the people
Colorful faces, you already know
I'm just trying to put the music back in your soul
I'm just trying to shake up the routine
The new hotness, lighting up the big screen
Type of rhythm
Make you move like you're supposes to
I thought I told you
You know how we gonna do
Let the beat build, you ain't gonna dance 
I'm just tired of everybody sitting on their hands
Bend your elbow, look around the room, then stop
Now make your hands clap
