Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Simmer down, simmer down
They say we're too young now to amount to anything else
But look around
We work much too hard for this just to give it up now
If you don't swim, you'll drown
But don't move, honey

You look so perfect standing there
In those American Apparel clothes you wear
And I know now, that I'm so down
The songs you make are a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now, that I'm so down (hey!)

Hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Let's get out, let's get out
'Cause this deadbeat town's only here just to keep us down
While I was out, I found myself alone just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket
And a tiny necklace with your name on it
Would you wanna hang out too?
'Cause that's just what I want to do

You look so perfect standing there
In those American Apparel clothes you wear
And I know now, that I'm so down
You're like a mixtape straight out of '94
You're like the air in my lungs and I need some more
And I know now, that I'm so down

Hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
