Now you can find me in Atlanta with an A Cap turned back
Dancing in streets with a little Georgia Peach
She beggin’ me to stay home, you know that I wish I could
But my flight leaves at 11, I’m headed to Hollywood
Wave at the Carolinas, St. Louis is Swag
Make a stop down in Dallas and maybe check out the Mavs
If I’m hungry - it’s Chicago cause Pizza’s my favorite food
Then its New York or New Jersey to get me more attitude

I’m dancing all over the map
Turn up, turn up, turn up this track

I just wanna dance
Turn up the track and party
Let me see your hands
Turn up the track, yeah
Turn up the track
[x2]

Tip toeing over Florida, Louisiana, to Bama
Then hit the streets of Las Vegas to keep an eye on the parents
Shake it up in Seattle but the weather's kinda gloomy
So I trip over Wyoming and get lost off in the boonies
Fly to Michigan, go fly fishing again
Shopping spree in Manhattan and now that my money’s spent
Take me back to the south, I’ll fall in love in these streets
This girl must be from Nashville cause she's a ten I see

I’m dancing all over the map
Turn up, turn up, turn up this track

I just wanna dance
Turn up the track and party
Let me see your hands
Turn up the track, yeah
Turn up the track
[x2]

We put our hands in the air so high
Wave 'em side to side
Cause we feel alive
And the music is pumpin'
Our heartbeats are bumpin'
We sing and we laugh
And we jump and we're jumpin' - hey!

I’m dancing all over the map
Turn up, turn up, turn up this track

I just wanna dance
Turn up the track and party
Let me see your hands
Turn up the track, yeah
Turn up the track
