I guess you get to a place where the dream you started off chasing
isn't even the same dream anymore. It's bigger.

Same 'ol b with the brand new cap
Hot new song with a dope new rap
I ain't gonna spit nothing but fact
And let this music take you back
Back to the moment we begin
Back to the time where we just pretend
Back to the basement with my friend
With a big idea and a blue ink pen
And now we've come so far together 
On this journey that was destined
From discovering my music
On that JB track at seven
Now it's time to crank the volume 
Take this to another level
Cause we fit together special
Bass and treble just as long as you love

As long as you love me
We could be starving
We could be homeless
We could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum
I'll be your silver
I'll be your gold
As long as you love, la, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Love me, love me
As long as you love, la, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Love me, love me

What's our plan and where we going?
What's our vision for the future?
Ask about me (and) I hope they say,
"The kid is something super!"
I see songs on top of Billboard
And imagine that could be me
On the front page up in iTunes
Labeled, "Hottest Rising EMCEE"
Nothing promised, not tomorrow
Just the moment, that's our present
So I'm counting every line I write
As something like a blessing
Never stressing, only promise
If you love me I'mma love you
Cause you made me when I never made you
As long as you love

As long as you love me
We could be starving
We could be homeless
We could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum
I'll be your silver
I'll be your gold
As long as you love, la, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Love me, love me
As long as you love, la, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Love me, love me
