I hear the melody melody
But the words don't mean a thing to me
It's like a symphony symphony
Without the choir and the strings
I hear the melody melody
But it don't sound right in my ears
Cause music aint nothin
Without you here

My friend
We've stuck together through thick and then
I think about you like somebody who's my own ken
When I'm unfocused it's you who I'mma get at and
When life is crazy and scattered
I think... that stuff don't matter so it's hard when
We get separated and part
Close as you are to me
Sometime's you couldn't be farther
And I hits hard
Thinking back on what all we've said
I'm marching right to the rhythm
These lyrics stuck in my head

It's a lonely place
Such a lonely face
When ya can't be right next to me
Cause the thought of you in my head
Playing on my heart strings
(You're on my heart strings)
Cause if I talk the talk
I try to walk the walk
And it's true when i say I care
A guess you never know what you've got
Until it's not there... and now it's not fair

I hear the melody melody
But the words don't mean a thing to me
It's like a symphony symphony
Without the choir and the strings
I hear the melody melody
But it don't sound right in my ears
Cause music aint nothin
Without you here

Thinking back it's been the two of us
Doing us
Who but us
Best of both worlds collide
And as long as we've been together
The music felt so alive
All the moments are wonderful
All the memories vibrant
My friend
We've got a story to create because
Far as this journey's taken us
Still dreams in the making
And it's all good
Long as I know that you hold me down
There's something about your love
That inspires this inner sound

It's a lovely place
Such a lovely face
When I feel ya right next to me
Cause the thought of you in my head
Playing on my heart strings
(You're on my heart strings)
And if you got the time
Then I got the rhyme
And we'll create a masterpiece
Cause you never know what you've got
Until it's all gone and this is my song

I hear the melody melody
But the words don't mean a thing to me
It's like a symphony symphony
Without the choir and the strings
I hear the melody melody
But it don't sound right in my ears
Cause music aint nothin
Without you here

And in my moment of truth
This is what I'mma do
In every song that I making
Know that I'll think about you
Because you've been here right beside me
Look what all we've been through
And there's nothing we can't accomplish
That I promise is true
In dedication to you
For all the things that you do
Take this music here as my token
Know I'm thankful to you
I dream a dream so big
That it's possible too
So don't forget me in the music
And I won't forget you

I hear the melody melody
But the words don't mean a thing to me
It's like a symphony symphony
Without the choir and the strings
I hear the melody melody
But it don't sound right in my ears
Cause music aint nothin
Without you here

I hear the melody melody
But the words don't mean a thing to me
It's like a symphony symphony
Without the choir and the strings
I hear the melody melody
But it don't sound right in my ears
Cause music aint nothin
Without you here
