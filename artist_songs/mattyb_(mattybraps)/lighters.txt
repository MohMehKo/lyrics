[Jason Chen:]
This ones for you and me
Living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see is a
Sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

[MattyB:]
By the time you hear this I'll already be out let me advance
I'm goin' from buyin' toys to goin' and buyin' the boys 4,5 of the
Toy stores outlets my daddy told me we're caught Matty and you could
Be it and I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell B boys
And girls lovin' em one in the same way and it's flowin'
Music's my choice and I'll choose it I got a voice and I will use it
I hope you know I'ma do it for you for you to see it I've cried many tears
Gosh given destiny part of me so it's only right that
I write til like I'm Mars right into the stage in Madison Square Garden
Until you're overcomin' your obstacles possible believe...I'll
Stop when I'm at the very top if you've waited on me on
The way up it's bout to be a scary drop cuz what
Blows up can't be seen so I'll blow up with a capital B

I love it when I tell 'em shut it cuz it wasn't that long ago when
Marshall sat luster lacked, flustered cuz he couldn't cut mustard muster up,
Nothing brain fuzzy, cuz he's buzzin' woke up from that buzz and now you wonder
Why he does it how he does it wasn't cuz he had buzzards circlin' around
His head waitin' for him to drop dead was it or was it cuz the people wrote
Him off cuz he lacked something' I'ma drop it guess it doesn't matter
Now does It what difference it make what's it take to get it through
Your thick skulls cuz if this ain't some story people
Don't usually come back this way from a place
That was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now Let these words be like a buffet to a hater's distaste
And let it be known from this day forward I just wanna say thanks
Cuz your hate's what gave me the strength to let these bic's
Raise cuz I came with 4'5' but I feel like I'm 6'8'

[Jason Chen:]
You and I know what it's like to be kicked down forced to fight
But tonight we're alright, so hold up your lights
Let it shine...

Cause this ones for you and me
Living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see is a
Sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
