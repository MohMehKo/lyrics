Baby, I love the way you movin', can't take my eyes off you
And everytime I see you doin', I swear you gonna shake somethin' loose

You better hold on to your hiney, that's what you better do, do, do, yeah
You better hold on to your hiney, 'fore that funky music breaks you in two

I can tell you really like to doin', and you make me wanna scream
And when you get your body into it, yeah
Ooh, you sexy thing

Hold on to your hiney, that's what you better do, do, do, do
You better hold on to your hiney,
'Fore that funky music breaks you in two, yeah

Ain't nothin' in the world like a smile, 'specially when it's aimed at you
And girl, you're just about to drive me wild,
Movin' that thing the way you do

You better hold on to your hiney, that's what you better do, do, do, do
You better hold on to your hiney,
'Fore that funky music breaks you in two, yeah

Hold on (hold on) to your hiney
Hold on (hold on) to your hiney
(That's what you better do, you better)

Hold on (hold on) to your hiney
You better hold on (hold on) to your hiney
(You better, hold your hiney)
Hold on to your hiney
(Better, don't you know you better, don't you know you better
Wow, hold your hiney)
Hold on to your hiney (hold your hiney)
Hold on (hold on to your hiney)
