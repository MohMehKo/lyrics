Oh when you dance the feet and you play a guitar
And you put it to the music and you're making on out
When you play it for the people and you get them to step
We'll show you got yourself a dancin' music band

You got a dancin', dancin', dance music band (whoa heey hey)
You got a dancin', dancin', dance music band (oom na na na na na na)

When someone goes to sleep at night with this song in their head
You keep them tossing, turning, chilling, chucked right out of their bed
When the people like to sway you've got to understand
They'll show you've got yourself a dancin' music band

You got a dancin', dancin', dance music band (whoa hey yeah)
You got a dancin', dancin', dance music band (oom na na na na na na)

When the feeling that you get when you're playing your song
Takes you higher, style ya all your night long
All you guys can dry musicians for the one night stand
Then she'll show you've got yourself a dancin' music band

You got a dancin', dancin', dance music band (whoa hey hey)
You got a dancin', dancin', dance music band (na na na na na na)

Get everybody, clap your hands
Then they'll show you've got yourself a dancin' music band
Get everybody, clap your hands
Then they'll show you've got yourself a dancin' music band

You got a dancin', dancin', dance music band (hey yeah)
You got a dancin', dancin', dance music band (na na na na na na naah)
