Nowhere To Run to, baby, nowhere to hide
Got Nowhere To Run to, baby, Nowhere to hide.
It's not love I'm a running from,
It's the heartbreak I know will come.
'Cause I know you're no good for me, but you've become a part of me.
Ev'rywhere I go your face I see ev'rystep I take you take with me.

Nowhere To Run to, baby, nowhere to hide
Got Nowhere To Run to, baby, Nowhere to hide.
I know you're not good for me, but free of you I'll never be, no.
Each night as I sleep, into my heart you creep.
I wake up feelin' sorry I met you, hoping soon that I'll forget you.
When I look in the mirror to comb my hair
I see your face just a smiling there.

Nowhere To Run, Nowhere to hide from you baby,
Got Nowhere To Run to, baby, Nowhere to hide.
I know you're no good for me, but you've become a part of me,
How can I fight a lover that shouldn't be when it's so deep,
so deep, deep inside of me
My love reaches so high I can't get over it.
It's so wide I can't get around it, no
Nowhere To Run, Nowhere to hide from you baby.
Just can't get away from you baby, no matter how I try to baby,

Nowhere to hide. I know you're no good for me, but free of you I'll never be,
Nowhere To Run, Nowhere to hide, Got Nowhere To Run to baby.
