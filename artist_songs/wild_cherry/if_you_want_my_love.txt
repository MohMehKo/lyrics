Hey
Ahhh

I tried and tried and tried for such a long time
To talk that lady down
I mean a
I worked so hard I used a best plan
But I still I haven't got her off the ground
So I told her
Alright baby I'll go away
And I won't bother you no more
But she said
No, no, no, don't you stay
What you want to go running from me for?
Oh then she smiled and she looked at him
Said oh, oh baby, don't you understand how

If you want my love (hey), all you gotta do is say it
If you want my love (yeah), all you gotta do is say it
If you want my love (oh yeah), all you gotta do is say it
If you want my love, all you gotta do is say it

I said made me, made me, made me feel like such a fool
To have carried on like that
I mean a
I thought the disco down was oh so cool
But I learned that's only rumour and not a fact
She said come on out
I say what you mean?
What you really want to do?
You don't need no battle plan
No blood or skin
Tell me am I getting through to you?

Oh then she smiled and she took my hand
Said oh, oh baby don't you understand that

If you want my love (yeah yeah), all you gotta do is say it
If you want my love (hey), all you gotta do is say it
If you want my love (get it through with me), all you gotta do is say it
If you want my love (come on now), all you gotta do is say it

Ooh I tell the story in the end
I'm gonna pay
For all the wrong I've done
All the times it even ticks me and I go astray
But you know we've all got to have our fun
I took her advice
Cut the job and let it out
She said I do believe you've got it right
I'll take you home and show you what it's all about (hoo hoo whoah)
It's gonna be a crazy night

Then she smiled and she took my hand
Said oh, oh baby don't you understand that

If you want my love (yeah), all you gotta do is say it
If you want my love (come on and), all you gotta do is say it
If you want my love (speak out honey), all you gotta do is say it
If you want my love (come on and), all you gotta do is say it

If you want my love (ay), all you gotta do is say it
If you want my love (speak out now), all you gotta do is say it
If you want my love, all you gotta do is say it
If you want my love, all you gotta do is say it
