Fools fall in love
So I can read
I'm a fool for you
And you're a fool for me
Each day we go on the leave and we're barely a feet apart
But you know in your heart
That you and I should be together

Stars shine above (Stars shine above)
They tell no lies
It's you I'm thinking of (I'm thinking of)
I tell you why
Some things were just meant to be
They go together so well
And that's why I can tell
That we two fools should be together cos'

Fools fall
Fools fall in love

Hey baby
You said that love is a gamble and sometimes that you never win
But you know in the end
That you can count on me to come around and prove

Fools fall in love (oho oh oh)
Can't you see
It's you I'm thinking of (do do do dooo doo)
Hey constantly

Come on boy here girl and say it
The way I know you wanna do (wanna do)
Cos you know that I love you
And baby I know that you love me too

(Fools fall)
They do fall
(Fools fall in love)
Hey baby baby now that I found you I can't let you go
(Fools fall in love)
Now baby I love you
Baby I need you now
(Fools fall in love)
Come on baby, come on baby
(Fools fall in love)
Come on baby
Give it to me yeah yeah
Baby, baby
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Fools fall in love)
