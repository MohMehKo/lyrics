Hey, is it the beat that makes you wanna dance?
Is it the message that makes you take a chance?
Is it the melody that makes you wanna sing?
Is it the bump that makes you boogie on your thing? Yeah

(Ah, tell me what could it be) What could it be?
(Mama, tell me what in the funk do you see) What do you see?
(Ah, tell me what could it be) What could it be?
(Mama, tell me what in the funk do you see)
Oh, whatever it is, it's really got a hold on me, yeah
Yeah, yeah, hey

Yeah, woke up one night and feelin' so strange
This rank of music was playing in my brain
The mass confusion is drivin' me insane
The hell with Woodstock, I'm goin' on Soul Train, yeah

(Ah, tell me what could it be) What could it be?
(Mama, tell me what in the funk do you see) What do you see?
(Ah, tell me what could it be) What could it be?
(Mama, tell me what in the funk do you see)
Oh, whatever it is, it's really got a hold on me, yeah
Yeah...

Yeah, hey, hey...
(Ah, tell me what could it be) What could it be?
(Mama, tell me what in the funk do you see) What do you see?
(Ah, tell me what could it be) What could it be?
(Mama, tell me what in the funk do you see) Yeah, hey, yeah

(Ah, tell me what could it be) What do you see, baby?
(Mama, tell me what in the funk do you see) Tell me what in the funk do you see
(Ah, tell me what could it be) Hey, come on, yeah, what could it be?
(Mama, tell me what in the funk do you see) Tell me what in the funk do you see
Whatever it is, it's really got a hold on me, yeah
Come on, do it, yeah
Oh, got a hold on me, yeah
Feel just like James Brown, yeah
I'm goin' on Soul Train
Come watch me dance
