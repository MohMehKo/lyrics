[Chorus:]
(Hold on)
Baby, hold on to me
Whatever will be will be
The future is ours to see
When you hold on to me

Baby, what's these things you've been sayin'
Right there behind my back
Is it true you might want a better life
Is it true you think there's these things that I lack

Ah, think about it baby
I'm gonna take you to the top

[Chorus]

Oh baby you know the future's lookin' brighter
Every mornin' when I get up
Don't be thinkin' 'bout what's not a love now
Baby just be thinkin' 'bout what we got

Oh, think about my love now
I'm gonna give you all I got

[Chorus]

Yeah
Rich man to the poor, poor man
Really don't mean all that much
Momma always told me
Money can't buy you love

[Chorus]

I say ooo, hold on
Ooo, hold on to me tighter
'Cause I'm never gonna leave you now
Baby please believe me now
I'm never gonna let you go
So hold onto me tighter

Hold on
I say ooo, hold on to me tighter
'Cause I'm never gonna leave you now
Baby please believe me now
I'm never gonna let you go
So hold onto me tighter

Rich man to the poor, poor man
Really don't mean all that much
Momma always told me
Cher, money can't buy you love

[Chorus]

Hold on
