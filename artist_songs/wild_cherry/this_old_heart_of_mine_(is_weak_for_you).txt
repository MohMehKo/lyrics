Ooh, this old heart of mine been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away, I think you're gone to stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that flow
Bringing you back again, hurting me more and more

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside 
'Cause each day that passes by
You got me never knowing if I'm coming or going, but I

I love you (Yes, I do, yes, I do)
This old heart of mine, darling, it's weak for you
I love you, yes, I do (Yes, I do, yes, I do)

Ooh, these old arms of mine miss having you around 
Makes these tears inside start falling down
Lonely nights that come, memories that flow
Bringing you back again, hurting me more and more

Always with a half a kiss
Reminds me of what I miss
And though I try to control myself
Like a fool I start grinnin' 
My head starts spinnin' 'cause I

I love you (Yes, I do, yes, I do)
This old heart of mine, darling, it's weak for you
I love you, yes, I do (Yes, I do, yes, I do)

Ooh, I try hard to hide my hurt inside 
This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin' 
The way you're treating me leaves me incomplete
You're here for the day, gone for the week now

But if you leave me a hundred times 
A hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours whenever you want me
I got to clap and shout it and tell the world about it, 'cause I

I love you (Yes, I do, yes, I do)
This old heart of mine, darling, it's weak for you
I love you, yes, I do (Yes, I do, yes, I do)

Hoo, I love you (Yes, I do, yes, I do)
This old heart of mine, darling, it's weak for you
I love you, yes, I do (Yes, I do, yes, I do)

Yeah, I love you (Yes, I do, yes, I do)
This old heart of mine, darling, it's weak for you
I love you, yes, I do (Yes, I do, yes, I do)
