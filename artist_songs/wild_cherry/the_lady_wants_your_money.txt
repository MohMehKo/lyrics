You just sold a million copies of your latest funky smash
Now you're wonderin' what you're gonna do with all of that spendin' cash
That lady you've been married to, she says she doesn't need you now
Says she only stayed with you in case you made a better town anyhow

She's takin' what she's got to get what she can take
She made her every move to get what she can make
Let me tell you, sir

(No, no, it ain't funny) It ain't funny
(The lady wants your money) The lady wants your money, it's amazing
(No, no, it ain't funny) Mmm, it ain't funny
(The lady wants your money) The lady wants your money, your money

Hey, all the needy fellows in the whole wide world gonna be your best friend now
Ain't it kinda funny how all of that money brings the ladies from miles around?
Ain't gonna let 'em, ain't gonna let 'em, ain't gonna let 'em take advantage, you say
But you can't stop her, can't stop her when she starts shakin' that good thing over your way

She give you what you want to get what she can take
She make her every move to get what she can make
Let me tell you, sir

(No, no, it ain't funny) Ooh, it ain't funny
(The lady wants your money) The lady wants your money, it's amazing
(No, no, it ain't funny) Mmm, it ain't funny
(The lady wants your money) The lady wants your money
Watch your baby!
Mmm, yeah

The lady wants your money
The lady wants your money
Yeah

Maybe one day, maybe two days, maybe three days you're gonna see what I mean
That sweet young thing and then her sugar daddy too, is gonna cop up, know the scene?
You better get away, better get away buddy, before ya come around cryin' the blues
A heartbreak city doesn't feel so pretty when you're puttin' on my hurtin' shoes

She give you what you want to get what she can take
She make her every move to get what she can make
Let me tell you, sir

(No, no, it ain't funny) It ain't funny
(The lady wants your money) The lady wants your money, it's amazing
(No, no, it ain't funny) Ooh, it ain't funny
(The lady wants your money) The lady wants your money, it's amazing, yeah
(No, no, it ain't funny) It ain't funny
(The lady wants your money) Yeah, the lady wants your money, it's amazing
(The lady wants your money) Money
(The lady wants your money) Money
(The lady wants your money) Money
