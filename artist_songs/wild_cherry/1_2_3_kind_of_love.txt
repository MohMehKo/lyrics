Woke up this morning with a smile on my face
Wondering to myself
If I'm in the right place
This kind of feeling is too good to be true
Babe never met a dream since the day I met you
Now you're the cream in my coffee
The sugar in my tea
You're so much sweeter than honey to me
And now every day girl and every night
I take your good lovin' and just hold on tight

Well it's a 1 2 3 kind of love for me
The first one is attraction, the second's a fantasy
It's a 1 2 3 kind of love for me
And the last one is the best one
It's forever, together, together, forever for you and me
Oh, Oh yeah

Oh my, my
What could this be?
This sweet young thing you've got a hold on me
Eyes so dark
Your hair's so long
Those looks that you give girl, they come on so strong
You're a real showstopper
Like nothing I've ever seen
Guys stop and stare cos' there's no in between
Now you're the only one that can ever hold me down
Cos when I look at you there's just no one else around

Well it's a 1 2 3 kind of love for me
The first one is attraction, the second's a fantasy
It's a 1 2 3 kind of love for me
And the last one is the best one
It's forever, together, together, forever for you and me
Oh yeah

Oooh baby, hold on woman
I've got to speak true
My everything was the day I met you
You give me something that's so hard to find
Baby you've given me reason why

Well it's a 1 2 3 kind of love for me
The first one is attraction, the second's a fantasy
It's a 1 2 3 kind of love for me
It's forever, together, together for you and me

1 2 3 kind of love for me
The first one is attraction, the second's a fantasy
1 2 3 kind of love for me
It's forever, together, together for you and me

1 2 3 kind of love for me
