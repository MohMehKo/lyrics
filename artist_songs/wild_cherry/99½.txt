Hey, yeah
Got to have all your love
Both night and day, yeah
Yes, I do
Said, not just a little part
But all of your heart
Come on, baby, let me tell you

Ninety-nine and one half just won't do it (Just a little bit)
No, I got to have a hundred (Just a little bit)
Hey, got to have a hundred (Just a little bit)
Yeah, got to have a hundred (Just a little bit)
Listen, baby

Don't be led in the wrong direction, no, hey
Start the thing, a man need a little love and affection
You know I got to tell you

Ninety-nine and a half just won't do it (Just a little bit)
No, I got to have a hundred (Just a little bit)
Hey, got to have a hundred (Just a little bit)
Oh, got to have a hundred (Just a little bit)

We got to bring it all down
And start livin' right
Hey, babe, stop messin' around
And gettin' things uptight
You know you got to realize

Ninety-nine and a half just won't do it (Just a little bit)
No, I got to have a hundred (Just a little bit)
Hey, got to have a hundred (Just a little bit)
Oh, baby, got to have a hundred (Just a little bit)
Listen to me now

Hey, just won't do it (Just a little bit)
Oh, got to have a hundred (Just a little bit)
Hey, ninety-nine and a half won't do it (Just a little bit)
Oh, baby, got to have a hundred (Just a little bit)
Say, I gotta have
Ninety-nine and a half won't do it (Just a little bit)
Got to have a hundred (Just a little bit)
Oh, ninety-nine and a half won't do it (Just a little bit)
Say, I gotta have a hundred (Just a little bit)
