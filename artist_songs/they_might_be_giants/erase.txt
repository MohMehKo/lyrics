you and I will be together when we shed our memory
I won’t wear an orange sweater when I get it off of me
when it’s as it someday is it always will have been the case
when your ever searching finger finds the button marked erase

finger find the button marked erase
like a deep sea diver falling into a mermaid’s embrace
put one box on the sidewalk then you return with the next and the first one’s gone
everyone gets on the bus out of town and the lights start going out one by one

button marked erase
when darlings must be murdered
when your heartbreak overwhelms your heart

think of this as solving problems that should never have occurred
please don’t call it strangulation, that is such an ugly word

press erase, ignore the shrill alarms
see the way the deep sea diver falls into the mermaid’s arms
put one box on the sidewalk then you return with the next and the first one’s gone
everyone gets on the bus out of town and the lights start going out one by one

button marked erase
when darlings must be murdered
when your heartbreak overrides the very
thing you can not face
the skeletons that won’t stay down
the mercy kill that can’t be drowned

put. box. sidewalk. then. return. next. first one gone.
everyone. on. bus. out. lights. off. one by one.

finger find the button marked erase
