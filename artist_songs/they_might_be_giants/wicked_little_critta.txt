The pro is here to lead the way, to save the day
(wicked little critter)
He clips the puck from bobby orr, he shoots he scores
(wicked little critter)
As he proceeds to torch the place, as he proceeds to scorch the place
As he proceeds to torch the place, scorcher, torcher, scorcher
(wicked little critter)

He's a wicked little critter with a sissy bar
And he lays a patch on the tar
He's a wicked little critter with a sissy bar
And he lays a patch on the tar

And he pops a wheelie on his minibike
And he burns rubber, and he peels out
He's a wicked little critter with a sissy bar
And he lays a patch on the tar

And he clips the ball from havlicek
And havlicek is used and abused
He's a wicked little critter with a sissy bar
And he lays a patch on the tar

He decides to ditch, and he ditches
And nobody knows where he ditched
He's a wicked little critter with a sissy bar
And he lays a patch on the tar

It's a wicked little guy
Wicked pissa little guy
Wicked scorcher little critta
He's a wicked little guy

He's a dink
Way to go
I like him
I got problems
