I'm a wigged-out daddy with bread on top
I dig an easy-bake granny with a whiskey mop
If you love me, you needn't the whole wheat crop
'Cause they had a useless battle and'll never stop

Bread hair, oh boy, oh boy
Bread hair, oh boy, oh boy
Bread hair, oh boy, oh boy
You're drivin' all my hope away

I'm a pumpernickel-do for you, dough you do
Use a yarmulka of hallah bread if you're a Jew
I belong to cayope, I be the wheat for you
Yeast and flour, bake an hour, it's annoying shampoo

Bread hair, oh boy, oh boy
Bread hair, oh boy, oh boy
Bread hair, oh boy, oh boy
Drivin' all my hope away

Bread hair, oh boy, oh boy
Bread hair, oh boy, oh boy
Bread hair, oh boy, oh boy
You're drivin' all my hope away

That's a gone rug, buddy
