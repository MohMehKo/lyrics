She's a different kind of girl
The kind you see in pictures
I think you might have seen her
Richard's on Richards

You know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean, bean
Richards

She doesn't ride a motorbike
She says it doesn't fit her
But she always wears a monocle
Richard's on Richards

You know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean, bean
Richards

Look over there, check out her hair
She's really on an ego trip

You know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean, bean
Richards
