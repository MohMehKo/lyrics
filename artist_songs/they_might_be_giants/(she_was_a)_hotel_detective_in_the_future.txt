She was a hotel detective in the future (future, future, future)
She had a hundred mechanical fingers (fingers, fingers, fingers)

She held an electrical eyeball
She shot the beam of a laser
Into my heart, into my heart

[unintelligibly:]
My heart is sinking through the detective spy beyond the Milky Way
It shoots through up a void detective spy-eye-eye and then it was destroyed

It was destroyed, it was destroyed

She has the replicant motives of a cyborg (cyborg, cyborg, cyborg)
She amputated my resistance with her mind warp (mind warp, mind warp, mind warp)

She walks with the beard of a rainbow
I weep, alone in my wormhole
Forever more, forever more

Mee mee mee mee
Mee mee mee mee mee
Mee mee mee mee
Mee mee mee mee mee

Mee mee mee mee
Mee mee mee mee mee
Mee mee mee mee
Mee mee mee mee mee mee mee mee

She walks with the beard of a rainbow
I weep, alone in my wormhole
Forever more, forever more
