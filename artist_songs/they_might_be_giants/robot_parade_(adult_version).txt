[Rather than the slow, melodic and dreamy version, this so-called adult version is a hard rocking, almost scary sounding mix of noise and guitar riffs. Concert renditions of the adult version have switched the places of children and robots in the "robots obey what the children say" line.]

In a future time
Children will work together
To build a giant cyborg

Robot Parade
Robot Parade
Wave the flags that the robots made
Robot Parade
Robot Parade
Children obey what the robots say

There's electric cars
There's electric trains
Here comes a robot with electric brains

Robot Parade
Robot Parade
Wave the flags that the robots made
Robot Parade
Robot Parade
Children obey what the robots say
