Hello mind. It’s good to be awake again
Spend some time reflecting
Hello hand. We all salute you hand
Five fingers strong. It’s good to have you back again
Hello eye. The complicated eye
Focused so hard on inspecting
Hello leg. Such a shaky leg
Just barely more than decoration

I’m not a motivational speaker
but on this I have arrived
It’s good to be alive. Good to be alive

Hello hand. We all salute you hand
Five fingers strong. It’s good to have you back again

I’m not some mega-church style preacher but my spirit is revived
It’s good to be alive. Good to be alive. Yeah.
I’m not a life coach or some teacher but I think we’ll all survive
It’s good to be alive. Good to be alive. Yeah.
