Tape has brightening arm connect
Wait that didn’t make sense
Self-paint lever itching does
That made even less sense
Shaving copter anymore
That’s not even a sentence
Weld crat tonsil speep enact
Some of those aren’t words

What does it mean?
What does it mean?
I’ll put it in my thinking machine

Uncle fourteen marching flame
Don’t know what you said
Sleep expensive cloud enjoy
Still not following
Gurb long trom flom dim fim lim

Pretty sure that’s gibberish
Dog dog dog dog dog dog dog
Now you’re just repeating the word “dog”

What does it mean?
What does it mean?
I’ll put it in my thinking machine

Cash fog ansel adams mouth
What?
Green grape gravy grateful grab
What?
Skele­tele­tele­ton
What?
The word for word is word

What does it mean?
What does it mean?
I put it in my thinking machine
