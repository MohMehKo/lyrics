I'm on the next plane to London
Leaving on runway number five
Next plane to London and I'm missing her
That baby of mine

Told her I was gonna be a star
But to do it I would have to go far away
But I'll come back someday
And take her away

I'm on the next plane to London
Leaving on runway number five
Next plane to London and I'm missing her
That baby of mine

Said that over here I wasn't in
Down in Hollywood I couldn't find a friend
Who would help me get in
Or listen to me

I'm on the next plane to London
Leaving on runway number five
Next plane to London and I'm missing her
That baby of mine

Maybe over there I'll get a start
Only hope by leaving I don't break her heart
The more important part
Than any record on the chart

Next plane to London
Leaving on runway number five
Next plane to London and I'm missing her
That baby of mine

Next plane to London
Leaving on runway number five
Next plane to London and I'm missing her
Whoa-whoa
