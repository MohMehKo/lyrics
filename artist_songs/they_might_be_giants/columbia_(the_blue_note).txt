The boys and the girls are getting together
At the Blue Note
I think we're all in for some groovy weather
At the Blue Note

At the Blue Note
People gather around
At the Blue Note
No need to feel down

Cause there's a sugar-plum lollipop cinnamon rainbow
At the Blue Note
(Sugar-plum lollipop cinnamon rainbow)

At the Blue Note
People gather around
At the Blue Note
No need to hang your head down

Cause there's a sugar-plum lollipop cinnamon rainbow
At the Blue Note
(Sugar-plum lollipop cinnamon rainbow)
Sugar-plum lollipop cinnamon rainbow
At the Blue Note
(Sugar-plum lollipop cinnamon rainbow)

There is some butterscotch lemon-drop sugary sunshine
At the Blue Note
(Butterscotch lemon-drop sugary sunshine)
There is some butterscotch lemon-drop sugary sunshine
At the Blue Note
