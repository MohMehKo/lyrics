Get your eight year-old out of a tree. 
Get your eight year-old out of a tree. 
Got up there. Quite a ways. 

There's no ladder as tall as that tree 
and what's sadder is he's still in that tree
Just what could've made him 
Of course you forbade him
He's a child

Hear the sounds of laughter
High above the rafters
He's gone wild

Neighbors shocked but the all still agree. 
There's no talking him down from that tree
And it rains. Still he stays

Get your eight year-old out of a tree. 
Get your eight year-old out of a tree. 

Now your nine year-old lives in a tree.
Now your nine year-old wants no T.V.
Not a stage. Not a phase

Now your nine year-old has been set free.
Now your nine year-old's home is a tree.
