Well, they said I was impossible
Yes, they said I was impossible
And that someone who behaved like me
Couldn't be, couldn't be

But I knew that I was possible
Not completely unbelievable
And the one they said could never be
It was me, it was me

But there's something else they didn't know
You can change your shape and you can grow
Out of nothing into something new
Something made up into something true

Though it happens quite impossibly
The impossible turns out to be
Possibly

Doh-doh doh-doh
Doh-doh doh-doh

Well, I'd like to be an octofish
Yes, I'd like to be an octofish
That's the thing that I would like to be
Octofoo, octofee

But they tell me it's impossible
Yes, they say it is impossible
It's a thing that I can never be
Never be, never be

But there's something else that they won't say
You might be one kind of fish today
But tomorrow everything could change
You could turn into an octoflange
Though it happens quite impossibly
The impossible turns out to be
Possibly

If you wish you had violet hair
That flows from your room down the stair
If you want to run as fast as a car
Or just want to be more like you are

Though it happens quite impossibly
The impossible turns out to be
Possibly

Doh-doh doh-doh
