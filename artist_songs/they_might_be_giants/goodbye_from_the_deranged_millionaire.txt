With this final venue song,
They Might Be Giants impossibly completed
The impossible task I had set before them.
In Brooklyn, even a deranged millionaire is bound by honor.
And so I must relinquish this studio to them, and concede at last,
They really are, Might Be Giants.
For the Venue Songs of They Might Be Giants,
I'm a deranged millionaire. Goodnight.
