There's a band
That's living in LA
But they never get to play
They're just working jobs all day

But their plan
Is to follow us around
As we go from town to town
They're copying our sound

And at the House of Blues in
West Hollywood
They're taking notes from the back row
And they're listening good

All you bands who are studying our grooves
And stealing all our truths
And copping all our moves:

I know your plan
Is to follow us around
As we go from town to town
You're copying our sound

And at the House of Blues in
West Hollywood
You're taking notes from the back row
Now listen good

All you bands who are studying our grooves
And stealing all our truths
And copping all our moves

I know your plan
Is to follow us around
As we go from town to town
You're copying our sound
(You're copying our sound)
You're copying our sound
(You're copying our sound)
You're copying our sound (sound!)
