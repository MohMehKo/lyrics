"This, uh, song. This song is called other show. Other kind of show. It's called 'Disappointing Show.'"
Disappointing show
I saw it
Disappointing show
Man those guys blow
Disappointing show
Get your shit together
Disappointing show
Man those guys blow

[Flansburgh]
"On the drums, Mr. Joseph Stalin on the drums, ladies and gentlemen, man.
Some other guy on the bass. Check him out. Whoa!
Slow down, slow down. Oh, on the guitar, yeah, that's... play it, son. Yeah."
Disappointing show, yeah
Man, those guys blow
I tried to sing along
Then it all went wrong
Disappointing show
Then the next song came on
That's when it all went wrong
And the PA fell on the crowd
Then the cops came
And took us away
For an extended period of questioning about the PA
What went wrong?
Should've rehearsed more
And talked about the song sequence
Disappointing show

[Flansburgh]
"Ladies and gentlemen!"
