Now I'm telling the truth
I'm finished with lies, lies
If you don't believe me now
You'll never believe me now

I should have my head examined
They'll see when they look inside
I won't have to say a word
I'll stop thinking what I shouldn't be thinking
I'll make everyone believe me

Can't you see I'm telling the truth
I'm finished with lies, lies
If you don't believe me now
You'll never believe me now
You'll think it's a lie

Couldn't we just put away the ancient history
Throw up our hands at the unsolved mysteries

I'm going to have my head examined
I'll prove you were wrong about me
Move the needle telepathically
I'll turn everything around and confuse you
Talk faster and faster till I lose you
I'll fix it so you can't remember what was true
And there'll be nothing to remind you

Starting now I'm telling the truth
I'm finished with lies, lies
If you don't believe me now
You'll never believe me now

Now I'm telling the truth
I'm finished with lies, lies
If you don't believe me now
You'll never believe me now

Lies, lies
You'll think it's a lie
You'll think it's a lie
You'll think it's a lie
