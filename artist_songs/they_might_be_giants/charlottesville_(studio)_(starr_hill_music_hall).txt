Yeah!

Starr Hill Music Hall
Glazed with alcohol
Spun from sugar by woodland creatures
You're the pupils, they're the teachers

Gonna pack my rucksack in my backpack
And scamper down the train track
Sell the car, sell the house, sell the keys

Yeah!

Starr Hill Music Hall
Exploded like a basketball
Filled with devils from the depths of Hell
Hey, what's that smell?

Gonna pack my backpack in my rucksack
And scamper down the train track.
Sell the dog, sell the fish, sell the birds

Hoo hoo hoo [3x]
