The stars got together and extinguished the moon and sun
And they reigned forever in the night sky they had won
The words assassinated the book
The kitchen cooked and ate the cook

Aw yeah, what is that certain je ne sais quoi?
Aw yeah, it's a stone cold coup d'état
Stone cold coup d'état
Stone cold coup d'état

The orchestra conductor has been captured and tried and killed
And the viola now occupies the throne that he formerly filled
The bark now commands the trees
The queen is overruled by the bees

Aw yeah, it has a certain je ne sais quoi
Aw yeah, it's a stone cold coup d'état
Stone cold coup d'état
Stone cold coup d'état

But if history is any guide
It cannot be understood
When you're not on the winning side

Around the dinner table, a family says grace
And the son sees the secret signal on his sister's face
Dad smiles at his wife
Daughter reaches for the knife

Aw yeah, it has that certain je ne sais quoi
Autumn leaves will burn (Yeah yeah)
As the seasons turn (Yeah yeah)
Nature's red in tooth and in claw

Aw yeah, what is that certain je ne se quoi?
Aw yeah, it's a stone cold coup d'état
Stone cold coup d'état
A stone cold coup d'état
