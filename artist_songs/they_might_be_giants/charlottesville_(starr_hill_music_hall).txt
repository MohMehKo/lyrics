Starr Hill Music Hall
Glazed with alcohol
Spun from sugar by woodland creatures
You're the pupil, they're the teachers

Gonna pack my rucksack in my backpack
And scamper down the train track
Sell the house, sell the car, sell the kids

Starr Hill Music Hall
Exploding like a basketball
Filled with devils from the depths of Hell
Hey, what's that smell?

Gonna pack my backpack in my rucksack
And scamper down that train track
Sell the dog, sell the fish, sell the birds

Woo hoo hoo
Woo hoo hoo
Woo hoo hoo
