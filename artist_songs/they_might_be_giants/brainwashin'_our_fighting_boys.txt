Somebody's been
Brainwashin' our fighting boys
Somebody's been
Deprogramming them so they won't fight anymore

They're searching for the missing chimp
But they won't find him
The missing chimp is sewing gimp with me
He won't fight because

Somebody's been
Brainwashin' our fighting boys
Somebody's been
Deprogramming them so they won't fight anymore

They're safe and sound
With its arms akimbo
Little legs are danglin'
In the pond, its big toe

Brainwashin' our fighting boys
Somebody's been
Deprogramming them so they won't fight anymore

They've been forced to live
In a land of love
Forced to live
In a land of love
