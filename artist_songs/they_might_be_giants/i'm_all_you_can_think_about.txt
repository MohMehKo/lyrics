Do you recall someone you haven't thought about in a long time?
That one with the tiny face, is he now on your mind?

I was never much in your life, but now
You can only think of me
When you're concentrating on someone else
You can only think of me
Your attention wanders when you're trying to read
You can only think of me

You can
Only
Think of
Me you
Can only think of me

I pronounce these words with unbearable precision
You can only think of me
Your apparent nonchalance belies the fact
That you can only think of me

(Me)
You can
(Me)
Only
(Me)
Think of
(Me)
Me you
(Me)
Can (Me) only (me) think of (me) me

Everywhere you look
Everything you smell
Every song you hear reminds you of me as well

Bup ba bup ba ba
Bup ba bup ba ba

Bup ba bup ba ba
Bup ba bup ba ba

When you're trying to order at a fancy restaurant
You can only say my name
Everytime you're making an important speech
You can only say my name

(Name)
My name
(Name)
My name
(Name)
My name
(Name)
My name
(Name)
My name
(Name)
My name
(Name)
My name

Bup ba bup ba ba
Bup ba bup ba ba

Bup ba bup ba ba
Bup ba bup ba ba
