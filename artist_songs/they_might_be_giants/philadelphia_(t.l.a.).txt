First we take art that is dead
And bring it to life with electric shocks
Its power must then be contained in a cage
Its beauty must then be placed on a stage

How do you spell "T.L.A."?

Where did the passion go?
How did we become so alone?
I look in the mirror, no one there
Wherever you sit, an empty chair

How do you spell "T.L.A."?
How do you spell "T.L.A."?
How do you spell "T.L.A."?
How do you spell "T.L.A."?
