When you head out tonight
In your quest for excellence in theater
I won't be there
I slammed my finger in the car door by accident
But I salute you in your ongoing quest
For excellence in theater

What's it like in there?
I will never know
The Recher Theatre in Towson
And the secret
Rock show

[spoken:] this will make more sense as we go

As you navigate the rotary
On your way to park your car by the theater
I'll hold your sweater
My leg is in a bear trap, I'm unable to attend
But I applaud you and I'll jealously read your blog
After the show

What's it like in there?
I will never know
The Recher Theatre in Towson
And the secret
Rock show

I have stood outside the entrance for 25 of your earth years
I've mastered breathing oxygen
And learned the human art
Of wearing clothes
But I shall never have the pleasure
Of knowing what goes on
In that theatre

What's it like in there?
I will never know
The Recher Theatre in Towson
And the secret
Rock show

What's it like in there?
I will never know
The Recher Theatre in Towson
And the secrrrrrrreeeeeeeeet
Rock show

Normally we would play that again just to try to get it right, but...
