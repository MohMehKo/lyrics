Lost my mind
Left somewhere behind
Must've been in amongst
The things we'd thrown out

Nowhere to be found
Probably buried underground
I could try to dig it up
But I don't want to waste my time

To summarize, this whole planet is elliptical
In short, I am both the bag and the boxing glove
So I'll apply this wet transfer tattoo showing
A finger pointing at the other one that says I

Lost my mind
Left somewhere behind
I must have put it in amongst
The things we'd thrown out

Nowhere to be found
Probably buried underground
I could try to dig it up
But I don't want to waste my time

Floating down a lazy river is my mind
Circling an unknown baggage carousel is also my mind

Do you ever even think of me?
Though I am always thinking of you
You're the last thing out there now
That somewhere out there

You lost the herd
Separated at birth
Shed around some visages
With intelligent remarks

Lost my mind
Left somewhere behind
I could try to dig it up
But I don't know where
Because I lost my mind

Lost my mind
The one I left behind
Nowhere to be found
Probably buried underground
And I must dig it up
But I don't know how
I died of time
