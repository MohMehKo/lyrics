Now broom you must now sweep for me
The dust it fills my room

No john i will not sweep for you
For i am not your broom

What nonsense are you speaking broom?
My words you must obey

Another life awaits me
And im leaving you today
I am not your broom
I am not your broom
I've had enough im throwin off
My chains of servitude
I am not your broom
I am not your broom
No longer must i sweep for you
For i am not your broom
