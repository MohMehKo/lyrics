I'll take back my pinata it's wasted on you
Just spinning that pool cue all over the room
And give back the blindfold that's under your shoe

Let's drink, drink this town is so great
Drink, drink cuz it's never too late
To drink, drink to no big surprise
But what words rhyme with buried alive
What words rhyme with buried alive

You could be a float for the 4th of july
Based on your theme of wallflowers grown wild
Look thru your peephole, you've won every prize

Let's drink, drink this town is so great
Drink, drink cuz it's never too late
To drink, drink to no big surprise
But what words rhyme with buried alive
What words rhyme with buried alive

In your monkey suit on a cigarette break
The lunchtime crowd, they won't even blink
But you'd be sad if they did
But you'll be sad...

Let's drink, drink this town is so great
Drink, drink cuz it's never too late
To drink, drink to no big surprise
But what words rhyme with buried alive
What words rhyme with buried alive
