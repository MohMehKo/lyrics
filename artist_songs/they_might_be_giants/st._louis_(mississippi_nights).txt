I've been to Cicero's, to Pops
The Pageant, to Point Fest
But nothing is like Mississippi Nights
No-ooh-oh, nothing is like Mississippi Nights

It's across the street from the Embassy Suites
And at the top of the hill from the biggest pile of broken glass
But nothing is like Mississippi Nights
No, nothing is like Mississippi Nights

That's a little song we call Missisippi Nights, ladies and gentlemen.
