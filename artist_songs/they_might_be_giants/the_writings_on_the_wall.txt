Half the boy and nothing else
Put me in the driver's seat
I wanna make promises I can't keep
Half the boy and nothing else
You were once my sole desire
You could've built me up, but you made me lie to you
You never took me serious
And my heart betrayed my every word
Now love's not only for the curious
You said the writing's on the wall
Well, I should know 'cause I wrote it all

Half the boy and nothing else
Put me in that driver's seat
I wanna make promises I can't keep
Half the boy and nothing else
I wish that I could land in jail
I wish that you could set my bail for me
You always took me serious
And my heart conveyed my every word
Now love is only for the curious
I said the writing's on the wall
But you should know 'cause you wrote it all

Half the boy and nothing else
Put me in the driver's seat
I wanna make promises I can't keep
