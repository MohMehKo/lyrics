Hello Mrs. Wheelyke
wouldn’t you like to write with a pencil?

HELLO I’m from
MISSISsippi
WE LIKE to wear
WOODEN footwear
YOU LIKE to wear
TWO RIGHT handed gloves
WITH A hat in

MAYBE some day
WE CAN let our wigs
HANG OUT to dry
ON THE clothesline
DRIVE WAY out of town
YOU CAN steer and I’ll
RIDE ON the hood
LIONS will cheer

If you find you’re hungry
you should eat a sandwich at the picnic

IF YOU some day
FIND YOU’RE in budapest

YOU SHOULD never
EAT A big pile of
SAND WHICH you found
AT THE beach or
PICNIC with wolves

MAYBE some day
WE CAN let our wigs
HANG OUT to dry
ON THE clothesline
DRIVE WAY out of town
YOU CAN steer and I’ll
RIDE ON the hood
LIONS will cheer
