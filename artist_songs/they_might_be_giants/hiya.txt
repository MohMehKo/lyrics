Hiya, hiya, hiya, hi

Don't be so jaded
I'm quite sincere
Though we may differ

You'll be right here
Top of the heap
Kings of all we survey

The last thing's a clinker
Who says it's not?
Just try your best

It's all that we've got
It's all that we've got
It's all that we've got

Hiya
Hiya, hi
Hiya
Hiya, hi
Hiya
Hiya, hi
Hiya
Hiya, hi
