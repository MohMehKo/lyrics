I got
I got kicked
I got kicked in the head backstage at the Stone
Stone Pone
Stone Pony

I got kicked in the head backstage at the Stone Pony
Where I swore to the guy
That the guy who took his beer wasn't me
Me got
Me got kicked
Me got kicked in the head backstage at the Stone
Stone Pone
Stone Pony

Me got kicked in the head backstage at the Stone Pony
Where I swore to the guy
That the guy who took his beer
Was a guy dressed just like me
Not me
Not me
Not me
