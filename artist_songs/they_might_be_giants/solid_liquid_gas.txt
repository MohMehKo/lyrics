Ice is a solid
Water is a liquid
Steam is a gas

Rock is a solid (rock is a solid)
Milk is a liquid (milk is a liquid)
And air is a gas

When water's warm enough
It's a liquid
When it's cold enough
It's a solid
And when it's hot enough
It's a gas
So could you make the air so cold it would be solid?
Could you make rock so warm it would be liquid?
Could you make milk so hot it would be a gas?
