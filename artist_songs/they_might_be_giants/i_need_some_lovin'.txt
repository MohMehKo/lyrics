I need some lovin'
Some turtle-dovin'
To dry the ocean
Of tears running down my spine

I need some kissing
But I know you're listening
To all the radios
That tune in to read my mind

They say
Loose lips
Fat cheeks
White teeth
Big hair
Brass bed
With a sign that reads
Nobody rides for free

I need a honey
To spend my money
To call my phone machine
And hang me up at night

I need some lovin'
Some turtle-dovin'
To dry the ocean
Of tears running down my spine
