[Flansburgh:]

This truck is driving out of my mind
But this truck has a mind of its own

Which is a lucky thing
'cause my leg is so short
That I can't reach the brake

This truck is driving out of my mind
But this truck has a mind of its own

Which is a lucky thing
'cause my leg is so short
That I can't reach the brake

Something is nagging at me
But never mind it's gone

This truck can practically
Find its own way without my help
Maybe I should lie back and cover my eyes
I think I'll do that

Yeah, now I'm totally resting
I'm reclining while I'm driving
Why have I not tried this until now?
I'm letting go, I'm letting go

[Linnell:]

Here comes the last page
All I need is an ending

Nearing the end of the last page
And the end of the whole book

Yeah, what to do with these loose ends?
I should change the beginning
But I shouldn't be typing
While I'm driving

While I'm making a phone call
While I'm searching through the glovebox
While I'm writing it all down while it's happening

They're gonna be so impressed
When they get a load of me

It's like I've got two extra pairs of hands
Two to write, two to steer, one to scratch
My head and one to cover my eyes
Which would help me to think up an end

Yeah, some kind of punctuational mark
Some kind of, some kind of
Some kind of trouble up ahead
What the hell, what the hell
