If you had such a checkered past
Then how come you're living today
I never wanted to bring it up
But what's the writing on your forehead say

Wide awake and lost, I don't feel anything at all
This sex appeal, I can't believe that's what it's called

Hey
Here comes somebody's body
Who threw me away
The one and only living doll
I never liked the colder side of her
Or anybody

I never tired of puppet shows
'Cause I like the way that they talk
I never wanted to bring it up
But what's the writing on your forehead say

My biggest expectations put me on her train
My biggest expectations bring me home again

Hey
Here comes somebody's body
Who threw me away
The one and only living doll
I never liked the colder side of her
Or anybody
