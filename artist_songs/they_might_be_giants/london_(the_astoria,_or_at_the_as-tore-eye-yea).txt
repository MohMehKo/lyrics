When shall I shower
In the one remaining hour
In the one remaining hour
Before the show?

Will I get to shower
In the one remaining hour
Will there even be the time?
The answer's no.

At the As-tore-eye-yea
They got the big light-up sign
That says "GAY"
Wake up and play

Do I sleep in my clothes
Only I and all the room knows
If I go to sleep in my clothes
On the bus

It's a secret only we know
If I go to sleep in my clothes
It's a secret between everyone
And us.

At the As-tore-eye-yea
They got the big light-up sign
That says "GAY"
Wake up and play

At the As-tore-eye-yea
They got the big light-up sign
That says "GAY"
Wake up and play

Wake up and play
