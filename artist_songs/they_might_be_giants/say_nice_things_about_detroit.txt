I always was the one to leave
I had no rehearsal for this role reversal
Say nice things about Detroit
The way you left you were a big big jerk
There I was anticipating
Some kind of love I’m still waiting
It’s like it was just last week
I tell myself but it wasn’t
Dressing up and making plans
I’m so bad at staying friends
Say something nice. say it again
I’d never known a libertine but you sure were thirsty
Then it gets all murky
Say nice things about Detroit
Remember standing in the doorway
Private words and holding hands
Can’t you pretend to pretend?
Say nice things about Detroit
The way you left you were a big big jerk
There I was anticipating some kind of love
I’m still waiting
Say something nice. say it again
