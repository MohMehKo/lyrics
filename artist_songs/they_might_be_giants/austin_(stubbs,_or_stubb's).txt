How's everybody doing? We are super-excited to be here tonight, ladies and gentlemen,
for so many different reasons, but the barbecue being really at the core of it.
So, um, we've got a special song for you right now, ladies and gentlemen.

Stubb's! (Ooh!)
Stubb's! (Ooh!)
Driving a wedge in my mind
Stubb's! (Ooh!)
Stubb's! (Ooh!)
Cutting off my skull

What're we gonna do with these bones?
What're we gonna do with these bones?
Stubb's! (Ooh!)
Stubb's! (Ooh!)
Bring 'em to Stubb's

[spoken:] Ladies and gentlemen, we're They Might Be Giants of Brooklyn, New York.
It's a stone cold gas to be here at Stubb's tonight.
On the drums, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Marty Beller from New York City.
On the superbass, direct from New York City, it's Mr. Daniel Weinkauf.
Just back from his vacation in New York City, from New York City on the electric guitar, Mr. Dan Miller.
My name's John. He's John. We're from New York City, (Hello.) thanks for coming out.

Stubb's! (Ooh!)
Stubb's! (Ooh!)
Removing the back of my skull
Stubb's! (Ooh!)
Stubb's! (Ooh!)
Cutting a notch in my mind

What're we gonna do with these bones?
What're we gonna do with these bones?
Stubb's! (Ooh!)
Stubb's! (Ooh!)
Bring 'em to Stubb's

Thank you very much.
