I taught you how to cyclops rock
And then you go and turn around and break my heart
And waste my cyclops time and mess up my cyclops mind

I'm sick like chuckie was sick, my defeated heart keeps beating on
I won't die, like chuckie won't die, but I'm not here to socialize
Gotta find a new place to hang out, because I'm tired of living in hell

I'm a mess since you cut me out but chuckie's arm keeps me company
I'm a fright with my tombstone smile
All the children run away from me
Gotta find new friends to hang with because you're all afraid of me

I taught you how to cyclops rock
And then you go and turn around and break my heart
And waste my cyclops time and mess up my cyclops mind

It was sweet like lead paint is sweet but the after effects left me paralyzed
I just stare with my one glass eye hoping you won't be back again
There's a whole new generation waiting to be wrecked by you

I taught you how to cyclops rock
And then you go and turn around and break my heart
And waste my cyclops time and mess up my cyclops mind

I taught you how to cyclops rock
And then you go and turn around and break my heart
And waste my cyclops time and mess up my cyclops mind
