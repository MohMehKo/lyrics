Julie at the station says They'll be here any minute now
But she's running out of records and her show is ending anyhow.
They can hear her saying Their name on the car radio
But the signal keeps fading out no matter which way They go.
I heard They Might Be somewhere in this town
They Might Be Giants got lost driving around

John said to John, I think we make a left at the light
There should be a big B, assuming this map is right
John looked over and said, Hey, no its not
It's a crumpled up wrapper from the fast food that we got
I heard They Might Be somewhere in this town
They Might Be Giants got lost driving around

Graham said to Brian, I see somebody walking this way.
So they rolled down the window and said, Hello, excuse me, hey
Could you tell us where we are and the best way out of here
They could tell from his face he had absolutely no idea
I heard They Might Be somewhere in this town
They Might Be Giants got lost driving around
Driving around
Driving around
They're still driving around
