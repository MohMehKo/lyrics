I never knew love could be like this
I never knew love could be like this
I go around thinking I'm a genius
But I never knew love could be like this

Cartography
Is not my metier
And the mountain side of daydreams
Too steep for me today
Lovers lost before us
And most did not return
The few who so held out hardy
Now going down and burned

I never knew love could be like this
Was anyone else but me surprised?
How anything happens is mysterious
And I never knew love could be like this

Biography
Is all they understand
No semaphore or secrets
Or just good old pretend
Now they all are sleeping
But this keeps us awake
These words, they need safekeeping
A promise not to break

I never knew love could be like this
I never knew love could be like this
I go around thinking I'm a genius
But I never knew love
Has it ever been love?
Oh, I never knew love could be like this
