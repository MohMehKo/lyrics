Trying to avoid
Being hit in the leg
By the bag that is going
Around and around
In the miniature sidewalk whirlwind

But the crumpled-up bag
Moves exactly as fast
As the speed at which you walk
To avoid being hit in the leg

Aaaah
To the amusement of others
You are hit in the leg
By the bag
And as soon as it touches your leg
It's completely attached

Trying to pull off the bag while still casually walking
Only increases the merriment
So at first you consider violence against the onlookers
But then on second thought
Maybe the bag

La la-la
La-la la-la
La-la la-la
La-la la-la la

Buppah-ba ba-ba
Buppah-ba ba-ba
Buppah-ba ba-ba ba
Ba ba ba buppah buppah ba ba
Buppah buppah buppah ba
Buppah-buppah-buppah-buppah-buppah ba

But it's made out of some kind
Of stretchy new plastic
That cannot be ripped in half

Sadly you walk on in anger and shame
Not considering the fate of the very next one
Who will try to avoid being hit in the leg
By the bag that is going around and around
In the miniature sidewalk whirlwind

Ever and always
Around the world
Everywhere you go
There will always be those
Who will try to avoid being hit in the leg
By the bag that is going around and around
In the miniature sidewalk whirlwind
Miniature sidewalk whirlwind
Miniature sidewalk whirlwind
Miniature sidewalk whirlwind
