Hey John.
Oh hey John.
What's going on?
Man, I'm confused.
You're confused, why?
I- I'm no good at remembering stuff.
Really?
Yeah.
Like what?

I can't remember what D is for!
You can't remember what D is for?!

I think it's for an instrument you play in a band.
I'm surprised you can't remember what D is for.

I can't remember there's too much noise.
Put your thinking cap on, I'll give you a hint.

See I can't find my thinking cap, I think it's lost!
John, come on tell me, D is for what?

D is for something that you play with sticks.
That's right, that's right, you're getting close.

D is for Drums, yes D is for Drums!
D is for Drums, yes D is for Drums!

Well, I'm glad we got that straight.
Hey John, I need-
Yeah?
I need some juice.
I've got some juice.
Well, let's go to your house.
Okay. I'll meet you over there.
Okay.
D is for Drums, D is for Drums!
