Up at dawn and
Sleepy and yawning
Still the taste of wine
Then I remember you're mine and
I've got that a world that's fine

What's before me
Routines that bore me
Punch the clock at 8
But what a lucky guy I am
I've got a world that's great

Atom bombs
Cape Canaveral and false alarms
Half the universe is up in arms
So I flip a little do until I'm holding you

What's the hassle
I'll buy the castle
We can live like kings
If we're together forever
I've got a world that
You've got a world that
We've got a world that swings

I'd like to take you on this wild, wonderful venture
Fly like a kite through space
No strings
I don't want to lose that bell that rings
I've got a world that
You've got a world that
We've got a world that swings

(We've got a world that swings)
We've got a world that swings
(We've got a world that swings)
We've got a world that swings
(We've got a world that swings)
We've got a world that swings
