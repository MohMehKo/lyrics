Cafe con pan, cafe con pan,

Rock on my hubba, the beat is blubba
Being stingy on the pike collect the one into the otha
Careen in tandem, the sea into the landem
The people in the pix they want to scarf and dig the clamdem

Awwwwwwwww yes! Mr. Excitement!

We nix the glaben, the knifey-knife is staben
Protrude into the hoobalicious scoff the extra aden
I write the mooky, my verse is extra spooky
Like Flansy in a soda can, it's trooky-trooky-trooky

Awwwwwwwww yes! Mr. Excitement!
