Maybe I know that she's been a-cheating
Maybe I know that she's been untrue
But what can I do

I hear them whispering as I walk by
She's gonna break his heart and make him cry
I know it's me they're talking about
I bet they all think I'll never find out

But maybe I know that she's been a-cheating
Maybe I know that she's been untrue
But what can I do

Deep down inside she loves me
Though she may run around
I know someday she'll love me
Someday she'll settle down

But maybe I know that she's been a-cheating
Maybe I know that she's been untrue
But what can I do

Oh, maybe I know that she's been a-cheating
Maybe I know that she's been untrue
But what can I do
