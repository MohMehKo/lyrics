I'm asleep but she's talking to me
She's walking 'round wearing all of my clothes
As she runs out of things to say
And grabs my coat to walk away

How bout another first kiss, she said
How bout another first kiss, I said
I want another first kiss like this
How bout another first kiss

Other people were too sentimental
Always worrying about their hair
Got tired of wasting all my time
Now I'm not worrying at all

How bout another first kiss, she said
How bout another first kiss, I said
I want another first kiss like this
How bout another first kiss

You could tell me we belong together
And I could tell you belong with me
But we've run out of things to say
And we'll be happy anyway

So....

How bout another first kiss she said
How bout another first kiss, I said
I want another first kiss like this
How bout another first kiss

How bout another first kiss she said
How bout another first kiss, I said
I want another first kiss like this
How bout another first kiss
