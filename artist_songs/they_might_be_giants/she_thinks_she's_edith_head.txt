Back in high school I knew a girl
Not too simple and not too kind
We both grew up, but I heard she'd changed
From a new wave fan to another kind

She think's she's edith head
But you might know she's not
The accent in her speech
She didn't have growing up

She think's she's edith head
Or helen girlie brown
Or some other cultural figure
We don't know a lot about

It's been years since I moved away
But at christmas I come home
And I saw her reflection
In the window of a store

She was talking to herself
Not too simple and not too kind
I walked on by, it was complicated
And it stuck in my mind

She think's she's edith head
But you might know she's not
The accent in her speech
She didn't have growing up

The accent in her speech
She didn't have growing up
The accent in her speech
She didn't have growing up

She think's she's edith head
She think's she's edith head now
She think's she's edith head
She think's she's edith head now

She think's she's edith head
She think's she's edith head now
She think's she's edith head
She think's she's edith head now
