I never knew what everybody meant by endless, hopeless bleak despair
Until one day when I found out
The first time I ever left my house
It saw me and followed me home
And stayed with me for my whole life

For years and years I wandered the earth
Condemned to a life of bleak despair
Then one day I looked around and found
It had disappeared

All this bleak despair
It was always there
And then one day it disappeared
In a puff of smoke
In an unceremonious way
One day it disappeared

All I had ever wanted in my life was only to be free of it
It drove away my family
It made me lose my job
Whenever anybody saw it
They'd say get out of here

For years and years I wandered the earth
Sick of my life, looking forward to death
The one day I looked around and found
It had disappeared

All this bleak despair
It was always there
And then one day it disappeared
In a puff of smoke
In an unceremonious way
One day it disappeared

For years and years I wandered the earth
Until I died and went to hell but my
Despair had ascended to heaven
That's how I finally got rid of it
