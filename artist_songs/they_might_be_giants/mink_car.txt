It's knocking off my diamond wig
Knocking me down unto the platinum ground
Woke up in a beautiful dream alone
Alone

I got hit by a mink car
Hit by a mink car driven by a guitar
And the silver chauffer says that it's all in your head
When your 24 carat dead
Dead

In my dream she is reaching past my hollow core
Then her smile is the open sign on an abandoned store

I got hit by a mink car

Hit by a mink car driven by a guitar and the silver chauffer says that it's all
In your head
When your 24 carat dead
Dead
Dead
