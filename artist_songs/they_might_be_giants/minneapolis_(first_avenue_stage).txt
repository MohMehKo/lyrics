Just before we got up here
All the guys were having a fight
Marty was yelling at Danny and John
John threw stuff at Dan
But the anger we felt for each other was kept
In our private backstage world
All our hatred was left behind
When we took command of the First Avenue Stage
Stage
First Avenue Stage
Avenue Stage
