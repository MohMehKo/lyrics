She's moving back to that college town
Gonna hang with anybody who's hanging 'round
She's got a job at the townie bar
And a car

She's going back to Michigan
Can't say I know that place too well
Raced elevators in some hotel
In Michigan

It feels a bit unnerving
How she cut the cord
I feel so undeserving
Participation award

She's moving back to that college town
Gonna pick up where she thinks she put it down
She's moving back to that college scene
Without me
