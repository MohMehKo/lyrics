I’m a coward
It’s a miracle I dare breathe
Overpowered by the gentlest summer breeze
Even when I close my eyes I like to think that I’m hiding

I need a confidant. A co-conspirator
To turn the tide on my losing side

I’m a coward
Guess I’d best make myself clear
I bet mumbles are what you’d expect to hear

I need a confidant who can see past my faults
And take the time to save me from myself
I need a confidant. A co-conspirator
To turn the tide on my losing side
