When tornados take over the world
There'll be no time for fretting
No fussing and complaining anymore
When tornados take over the world
You won't have your folks
To blame for all the stuff that's your fault

Your friends will be swirling
Right above your disembodied head

When tornados take over the world
All the things in the fridge
That fell on the floor will disappear
And all of your neighbors
Will be waving their flashlights at your house

Your friends will be swirling
Right above your disembodied head

When tornados take over the world
