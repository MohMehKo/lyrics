Smile wide scrub side feet on the dash. I’ll sleep the whole damn day
Slow Lane. Propane. Empties for cash. Rearview mirror thrown away

Oh, let me tell you about my operation. Doctors removed your memory (Tres bon!)

Ground floor. Screen door. Yelling inside. I think you know the scene
Front lawn. Break of dawn. Clothes on the ground. How could you be so mean?

Oh, let me tell you about my operation.
Doctors removed your memory
Oh, it’s good news. It’s just a quick procedure
Find happiness through surgery

Oh, let me tell you about my operation
Doctors declared I’m better now
Our liaison--oh it was poison baby!
Our liaison--it was a drag

Let me tell you about my operation
Doctors removed your memory
Oh, it’s good news. It’s just a quick procedure
Find happiness through surgery

Tres bon! Tres bon! Tres bon!
