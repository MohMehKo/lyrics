We got a special song for you now. This is, uh, a world premiere.
We just put this song together a couple weeks ago--
We took a couple weeks off just to put this song together.
Special deep, deep, quarantine.
This song is called House of Blues and it's about where you are right now.

There is a house
In New Orleans
Called the House of Blues
It swallows all
Who stray too close
It will come for you

It will seek you out at nightfall
Resistance is futile
It will find you in your hidey-hole
Resistance is futile

It will seek you out at daybreak
Resistance is futile
It will find you in your workplace
Resistance is futile

House of Blues
House of Blues
House of Blues
Aaaah!

Thanks a lot. How's it going?
