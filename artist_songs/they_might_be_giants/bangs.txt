Bangs
Above your eyes your hair hangs
Blow my mind your royal flyness I dig your bangs

Bangs
To drape across your forehead
To swing concordant angles as you incline your head

Once with a girl I fell in love sometime ago now she had...

Bangs
Are that on which the world hangs
I'm only holding your hand so I can look at your bangs

Bangs
Are like a pocket t-shirt
As casual as that while fully intentional

And in case you think I'm here cause I like making chit chat
Just remember what I said the money's under your hat

Bangs
Are that on which the world hangs
I'm only holding your hand so I can look at your bangs

Bangs
Above your eyes your hair hangs
Blow my mind your royal flyness I dig your bangs

Bangs
To drape across your forehead
To swing concordant angles as you incline your head

And although I like you anyway, check out your haircut
A proscenium to stage a face that needs no makeup

Bangs
Are that on which the world hangs
I'm only holding your hand so I can look at your bangs
I'm only holding your hand so I can look at your bangs
