We are the guests of Mr. Small's!
He's somewhere watching us through eyeholes in the walls

Mr. Small's Theatre
Partly hoping, partly scared
That we'll rock it so well, we will roll down the the hill
We will rock it so well, we will roll down the the hill
(Mr. Small's! Mr. Small's! Mr. Small's! Mr. Small's!)

I still have dreams about a place
Called the Electric Banana where we're falling into space!

Mr. Small's Theatre
Partly hoping, partly scared
That we'll rock it so well, we will roll down the hill
We will rock it so well, we will roll down the hill
We will rock it so well, we will roll down the hill
We will rock it so well, we will roll down the hill
(Mr. Small's! Mr. Small's! Mr. Small's! Mr. Small's!)
