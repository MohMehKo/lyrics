Well I was dancing in the lesbian bar
In the industrial zone
I was dancing with my friends
And dancing alone

Well in the first bar things were alright
But in this bar, things were Friday night
In the first bar things were just alright
In this bar things were Friday night

And I was dancing in a lesbian bar, ah-oo, ah-oo
I was dancing in a lesbian bar, oo, oo, oo

I was dancing in the lesbian bar
Way downtown
I was there to check the scene
And hang around

In the first bar folks were drinking sips
But in this bar they could shake their hips
In the first bar folks were drinking sips
In this bar they could shake their hips

And I was dancing in a lesbian bar, ah-oo, ah-oo
I was dancing in a lesbian bar, oo, oo, oo

In the first bar things were okay
But in this bar things were more my way
In the first bar things were just okay
In this bar things were done my way

And I was dancing in a lesbian bar, ah-oo, ah-oo
I was dancing in a lesbian bar, oo, oo, oo

In the first bar things were controlled
But in this bar things were Rock and Roll
In the first bar things were so controlled
In this bar things were way way bold

And I was dancing in a lesbian bar, ah-oo, ah-oo
I was dancing in a lesbian bar, oo, oo, oo
