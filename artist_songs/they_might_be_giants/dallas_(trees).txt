Tell the moon you've seen the serpent,
Found the sword and walked among the
Trees

Trees

Tell the moon you've seen the serpent,
Found the sword and walked among the
Trees

Trip the forest through the branches
On the limb you fell the nest of
Bees

Tell the moon you've seen the serpent,
Found the sword and walked among the
Trees
