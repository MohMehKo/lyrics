Greetings everybody, we're They Might Be Giants from Brooklyn, New York.
This next piece of music is called Celebrate Brooklyn.

The scroll unfurls
We hear the voice of Marty Markowitz
Now he's not frontin'
The Funky Bunch
He's Borough President
From the L to the J to the F to the G
Now who knows what that spells?

Let's Celebrate Brooklyn now
Even the Gowanus Canal
Even the Gowanus Canal
Even the Gowanus Canal
