Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm the orange peel
You don't remember
But I was once part of your orange

I'm the peel that you left on the floor
You took the good part and walked out the door
And I hate you for that
I hate you for that
I'm the orange peel

When the flood waters reach where I lay
French Broad River will float me away
And I hate you for that
I hate you for that
I'm the orange peel
I'm the orange peel
I'm the orange peel
