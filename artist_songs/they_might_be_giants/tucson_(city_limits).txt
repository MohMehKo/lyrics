[JF:] We have a special song for you.

Special.

[JL:] I live in a house
And the house has a ghost
And the ghost is myself
And the name of the house is City Limits:
Oh, City Limits

My brain is a curse
The curse has a name
It's written in blood
On the wall of the house
The house that is known by the name of
City Limits

No eyes on my face
No face on my head
No head on my body
Spooky blood!
City Limits
Ohhhh, City Limits

My brain is a curse
The curse has a name
It's written in blood
On the wall of the house
The house that is known by the name:
Ohh, City Limits

My brain is a curse
The curse has a name
It's written in blood
On the wall of the house
The house that is known by the name:
City Limits

Ohhhh, City Limits

Boooooooooooo
