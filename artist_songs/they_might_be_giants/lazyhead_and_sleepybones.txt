Lazy Head and Sleepy Bones
Always disagree
Though everybody says they should be friends
They're too tired to see

When Sleepy Bones says he's feeling tired
Lazy Head wants to rest
When Lazy Head says it's "number one"
Sleepy Bones says it's "best"

When Lazy Head uses imagination
Sleepy Bones daydreams
Sleepy Bones says, "It's not what it looks like"
And Lazy Head says, "It's not what it seems"

Lazy Head and Sleepy Bones
Always disagree
Though everybody says they should be friends
They're too tired to see

When Lazy Head says somebody's "skinny"
Sleepy Bones says "thin"
When Sleepy Bones says "identical"
Lazy Head says "twin"

When Lazy Head says the window is "closed"
Sleepy Bones says it's "shut"
When Sleepy Bones says that something "isn't"
Lazy Head says, "It's not"

Lazy Head and Sleepy Bones
Both take naps so long
And even though they should be friends
They can't get along

Lazy Head and Sleepy Bones
Always disagree
Though everybody says they should be friends
They're too tired to see
