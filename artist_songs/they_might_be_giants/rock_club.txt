we love all the people
and we love to rock the house
no one knows we're coming
so no one's coming out
to this particular rock club
have we played this club before?
you see, I can't remember
if we've played this club before

put your hands together
get on your knees and pray
next time we come around here
we won't be comin' back this way
or to this particular rock club
is that really the P.A.
or just somebody's radio
left in the corner of the room?
