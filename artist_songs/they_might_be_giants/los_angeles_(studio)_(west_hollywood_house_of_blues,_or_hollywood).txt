There's a band that's living in LA,
But they never get to play,
They just work at jobs all day.
But their plan is to follow us around,
As we go from town to town,
They're copying our sound.

And at the House of Blues in
West Hollywood,
They're taking notes from the back row
And they're listening good.

All you bands who are studying our grooves,
And stealing all our truths,
And copying all our moves,
I know your plan is to follow us around,
As we go from town to town,
You're copying our sound.

And at the House of Blues in
West Hollywood,
You're taking notes from the back row
Now listen good.

All you bands who are studying our grooves,
And stealing all our truths,
And copying all our moves,
I know your plan is to follow us around,
As we go from town to town,
You're copying our sound.
[echo] you're copying our sound.
You're copying our sound.
[echo] you're copying our sound.
You're copying our sound.
