Inside an empty glass
I'm squinting my eye
And turning off and on and on

And in my experimental film
Which nobody knows about but which

And even though I can't explain it
I already know how great it--
Even though I can't explain it
I already know how great it's

The color of infinity
Inside an empty glass
It's for this experimental film
Which nobody knows about and which
I'm still figuring out what's going to go
In my experimental film

Yeah, you're all gonna be in this experimental film
And even though I can't explain it
I already know how great it's gonna--
Yeah, you're gonna be in this experimental film
And even though I can't explain it
I already know how great it--
Even though I can't explain it
I already know how great it's
