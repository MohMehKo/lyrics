Two, three, four...

I died and went to heaven and the first thing I saw when I opened my eyes was the
Gibson Lounge
Gibson Lounge

Going to go back to Earth and redecorate my living room exactly like it (Gibson Lounge)

I'm going to blind myself tonight so the image I will always retain is of the
Gibson Lounge
Gibson Lounge

When I get my sight back I'll redecorate my living room exactly like it (Gibson Lounge)

Thank you.
