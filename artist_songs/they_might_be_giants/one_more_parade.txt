Hup, two, three, four, marching down the street
Rollin' of the drums and the tramping of the feet
General salutes and the mothers wave and weep
Here comes the big parade
Don't be afraid, prices paid
One more parade

So young, so strong, so ready for the war
So willing to go and die upon a foreign shore
All march together, everybody looks the same
So there is no one you can blame
Don't be ashamed, light the flame
One more parade

Listen for the sound and listen for the noise
Listen for the thunder of the marching boys
A few years ago their guns were only toys
Here comes the big parade
Don't be afraid, prices paid
One more parade

So young, so strong, so ready for the war
So willing to go and die upon a foreign shore
All march together, everybody looks the same
So there is no one you can blame
Don't be ashamed, light the flame
One more parade

Medals on their coats and guns in their hands
Trained to kill as they're trained to stand
Ten thousand ears need only one command
Here comes the big parade
Don't be afraid, prices paid
Don't be ashamed, war's a game
World's in flames, so start the parade
