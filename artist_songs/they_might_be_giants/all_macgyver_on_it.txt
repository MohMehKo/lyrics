We're gettin' metal with it
We're all MacGyver on it
It's not provisional and highly temporary
It's the unbroken synapses acting out and talking scary
They'd better listen up and fast 'cause now I'm metal on it
Grab your keys, grab your hat,
Grab your coat, tell your mom
You won't be home 'cause now
We're goin' metal on it

Now we're metal with it
We're all MacGyver on it
Things are different and kinda confrontational
Man, if you can't see, I guess you must be goin' blind
There's nothing left but the smoke that's comin' off the mind

They can run, they can hide
We will never be denied
They start the party quick
By goin' metal on it

We're gettin' metal with it
We're all MacGyver on it
It's not provisional and never temporary
It's the unbroken synapses acting out and talking scary
We're all MacGyver on it.
