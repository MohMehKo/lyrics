Moths beat on the windowpane
Telling me I'm not the same
Sounds of nothing, sounds of fear
Speak to me when no one's near

I'm on Rat Patrol
I'm on Rat Patrol

Well, those disappear inside
Floorboards creak and footsteps heard
Headlights turn into the drive
Then disappear into the night

I'm on Rat Patrol
I'm on Rat Patrol
