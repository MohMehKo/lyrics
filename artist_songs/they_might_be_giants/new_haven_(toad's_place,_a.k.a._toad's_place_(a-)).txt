Lookin' for somewhere to park this
Big old amphibian carcass
Goin' on a froggy excursion
Tryin' every froggy inversion

Takin' a frog stand
With my frog band
At Toad's

Doin' the lean back
With some greenbacks
At Toad's

Pollywog strummin' my six-string
Flies hangin' out on my tongue thing
Goin' on a froggy excursion
Tryin' every froggy inversion

Holdin' the mike stand
With my webbed hand
At Toad's

I'm off the lily pad
No time to feel bad
At Toad's
