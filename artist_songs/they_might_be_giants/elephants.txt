They're not the largest mammals
But they're biggest on the land
So when I say "please step away"
I know you'll understand

They've got two tusks up front for fighting
Or digging in the dirt
So you can see how easily
You'd end up getting hurt

Get out of the way
Get out of the way
The elephants are coming through your town today
Get out of the way
Get out of the way
The elephants are coming through your town today
The elephants are coming through your town
Today

They're great communicators
With waves called infra-sound
Seismically clear, you'd barely hear
Them travel through the ground

And while the cows all stick together
And congregate at home
The bulls go out and walk about
They'd rather be alone

Get out of the way
Get out of the way
The elephants are coming through your town today
Get out of the way
Get out of the way
The elephants are coming through your town today
Elephants are coming through your town today
Elephants are coming through your town
Today

Get out of the way
Get out of the way
The elephants are coming through your house today
Get out of the way
Get out of the way
The elephants are coming through your house today
Elephants are coming through your house today
Elephants are coming through your house
Today
