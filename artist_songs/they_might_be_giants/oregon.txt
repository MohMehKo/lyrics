Oregon is bad
Stop it if you can
Here it comes
Here it comes
Now it's after you
Flee to someplace new
Run away
Run away

From the penthouse to the prison
to the humble piedaterre
Are they taking up the cry
In the brothel
In the castle
On the crowded boulevard
Do they sing the dreadful words

Oregon is bad
Stop it if you can
Here it comes
Here it comes

Oregon is bad
Stop it if you can
Run away
Run away
