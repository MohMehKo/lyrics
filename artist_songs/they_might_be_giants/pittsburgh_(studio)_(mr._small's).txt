We are the guests of Mr. Smalls.
Somewhere he's watching us through eyeholes in the walls.

Mr. Small's Theater - partly hoping, half afraid
We could rock it so well
We would roll down the hill;
We could rock it so well
We would roll down the hill.

I still have dreams about a place
Called the Electric Banana
Where we're falling into space.

Mr. Small's Theater - partly hoping, half afraid
We could rock it so well
We would roll down the hill;
We could rock it so well
We would roll down the hill.

Mr. Small's, Mr. Small's, Mr. Small's, Mr. Small's!
