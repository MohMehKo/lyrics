Girl! Why not take out the trash?
And once you get him out, tell him not to come back again
Girl! Put that cat in the bin
After what he said, after everything he did

You had him figured out a while ago
And I know it's not exactly breaking news
But it's all been a little like a trial for you
And a bunch more talking won't make him true

Ah, c'mon, Girl! Why not take out the trash?
And once you get him out tell him not to come back again
Girl! Why not give him the slip?
Get the crooked straight
Get the go-getter good and gone

Why? It's so plain that he's just makin' it up
And he's still got you coming back for more
Why you never ever think of breaking it up
Tell me, what bad deal's gonna close that door?

Ah, c'mon, Girl! Why not take out the trash?
And once you get him out, tell him not to come back again
Girl! Why not give him the slip?
Get the crooked straight
Get the go-getter good and gone

I'm not saying all the boys are the same
But some boys are the same and it's Thursday now
I'm not saying all the boys are the same
But some boys are the same and it's Thursday now
I'm not saying all the boys are the same
But some boys are the same and it's Thursday now

Girl! Why not take out the trash?
And once you get him out, tell him not to come back again
Girl! Put that cat in the bin
After what he said, after everything he did

Girl! Why not take out the trash?
Girl! Why not take out the trash?
Ah, come on, Girl! Why not take out the trash?
And once you get him out, tell him not to come back again

Girl! Why not give him the slip?
Get the crooked straight
Get the go-getter good and gone
