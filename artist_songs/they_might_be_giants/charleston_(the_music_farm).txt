[JF:] You ready, John?

[JL:] I think so, yeah. We just made this song up today, like we do.
It's about--it's called The Music Farm. That's the name of the song. This is how it goes.

Farm, farm
Music farm
Growing music straight out of the ground
Music chickens lay music eggs
You get the idea

Farm, farm
Music farm
Independent, family-owned
Threatened by
Agrimusic
You get the idea

Government paying subsidies
Music farmers take the cash
Only way they can survive
Paid to stop the song

Farm, farm
Music farm
What's that sound coming out of the ground
Music milk from music cows
You get the idea

Music farm.
