Um, we've been making up songs for every venue that we play in for the last
Month or so and this one is called Richard's on Richards.

She's a different kind of girl
The kind you see in pictures
I think you might have seen her
Richard's on Richards

You know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean-mean
Richards

She doesn't ride a motorbike
She doesn't think it fits her
But she always wears a monocle
Richard's on Richards

You know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean-mean
Richards

Look over there
Check out her hair
She's really on an ego trip

You know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean-mean
Richards

Thank you very much.
