Every Christmas card I write
Every Christmas card I write
Has been stolen
Has been stolen
Every Christmas card I write has been stolen

Every Christmas card I write has been stolen
Every Christmas card I write has been stolen
Has been stolen
Has been stolen
Every Christmas card I write has been stolen

Stolen
Has been stolen
Every Christmas card I write
On the little desk in the corner of my room

I find stolen the next day
I find stolen the next day
All of the Christmas cards I write
Become stolen the next day
From my room

In my little desk in the corner of my room
Every Christmas card I write
Is stolen
Is stolen
Every Christmas card I write
Been stolen
From the little desk in the corner of my room
It's been stolen

Every day
Every Christmas card I write
Has been stolen from my desk
I don't know why
It's been stolen
It's been stolen
Stolen
Stolen
Stolen
Stolen
Stolen
