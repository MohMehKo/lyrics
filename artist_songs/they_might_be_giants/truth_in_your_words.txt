Erstwhile and estranged, I know I'm one in a long chain
I came to get my mini-bike returned
Same old bad times, I know they're one in a long line
I came to get my mini-bike returned

And I know there's truth in your words
Buried inside of your words
Yeah I've learned a thing or two
From hard times spent with you

And I know there's truth in your words
Buried inside of your words
Yeah I've learned a thing or two
From hard times spent with you
