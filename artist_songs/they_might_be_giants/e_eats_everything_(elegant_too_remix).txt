[Sung repeatedly in the background throughout the song:]
E eats everything

A hardly has an appetite
And pokes at food too long
And B can barely bother
Because all the food is wrong
C likes only candy
And chocolate by the box
D is just disinterested
In anything you've got

But E eats everything
Yeah, E eats everything
E eats everything
Yeah, E eats everything

E
