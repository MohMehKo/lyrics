Mrs. Cinderella
Please don't pound on my chest
I can not see you now
I can not have seen you before

When it turns twelve o'clock
I'll be back by myself
And you'll be back in his arms
As Mrs. Somebody Else

Mrs. Cinderella
Please don't knock down my door
You've been around the world
And I've been around my block

When I hear you say (when I hear you say)
I hear somebody talking (I hear somebody talking)
And when I hear you talking (and when I hear you talking)
I hear somebody say (I hear somebody say)
