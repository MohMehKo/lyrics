(Ho ho-ho, ho ho-ho)
(Ho ho-ho, ho ho-ho)

The diving board can sense the pool
The scent of water down below
The swimming pool can see the board
Refracted through the gentle waves

The diving board can sense the pool
The diving board can smell the pool
The swimming pool can see the board
The diving board can sense the pool

The chemical perfume reveals
A massive chlorinated lake
The undulating shape above
To her is unmistakable

The diving board can sense the pool
The diving board can smell the pool
The swimming pool can see the board
The diving board can sense the pool

Something overhead is suspended there
There's a muffled bounce
Something starts to fall

He doesn't need to see or touch
To know each intimate detail
She holds the image of him there
And in this way possesses him

The diving board can sense the pool
The diving board can smell the pool
The swimming pool can see the board
The diving board can sense the pool (the swimming pool)

Diving board
Diving board (the swimming pool)
Diving board
Diving board (the swimming pool)
Diving board
Diving board (the swimming pool)
Diving board
Diving board

(Ho ho-ho, ho ho-ho)
(Ho ho-ho, ho ho-ho)
(Ho ho-ho, ho ho-ho)
(Ho ho-ho, ho ho-ho)
