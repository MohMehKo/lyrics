Ten miles from nowhere
There's a story that's true
About a fine girl
And a boy just like you
They fell so deeply
But then fell apart
Now they say the same words
Of what used to be
What used to be

I blame you (I blame you)
I blame you (I blame you)
I blame you (I blame you)

He drops his car keys
And crawls on the ground
Finds her old haircomb
She'd wear into town
Can't bear to keep it
Or throw it away
Gets back down on his kness
Put it back where it lay
Back where it lay

I blame you (I blame you)
I blame you (I blame you)
I blame you (I blame you)
