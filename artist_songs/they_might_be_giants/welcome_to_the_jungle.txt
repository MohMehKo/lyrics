Welcome to the jungle, Jim
Welcome to the jungle, Jim
Welcome to it, Jim

Welcome to the jungle, Anne
Welcome to the jungle, Dan
Welcome to it, John

Think you're gonna like
I think you're gonna like it
Once you've given the jungle a chance
Think you're gonna like it
Once you've given it a chance

In the Jungle
In the Jungle
In the Jungle

Now you will be with me
Put your hand in my hand
Lift up the rock and see all the things
That share the jungle with us

Welcome to the
Welcome to the
Trees
Trees

Push me in the face again
Push me in the face again
Push me in the face

Push me in the face again
Push me in the face again
Push me in the face

Didn't really like
I didn't really like
The last time when you pushed me in the face
Didn't really like
The last time when you pushed my face

In the Jungle
In the Jungle
In the Jungle

Now you will be with me
Put your hand in my hand
Lift up the rock and see all the things
That live in the jungle with us

Put your hand near the bug
We are so much like them
See how the bug reacts to your hand
In the same way as I do
