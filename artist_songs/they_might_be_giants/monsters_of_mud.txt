It's unbelievable
They're walking through the streets of town
They act like people but they're
Shapeless, grimy, gray and brown

(Made of mud, they're made of mud)
(Made of mud, they're made of mud)

It used to be that
Everyone you'd see was so well scrubbed
Everything's different now
Ever since the monsters of mud

Look out there's one right there
It freaks me out, it's covered in crud
All of our values have been challenged
By the monsters of mud

Here they slime
There they slouch
On the carpet
On my couch

Mud monsters everywhere
You can't escape the slobbering flood
We couldn't stop them so we all became
The monsters of mud

It's unbelievable
We're walking through the streets of town
We act like people but we're
Shapeless, grimy, gray and brown

(Made of mud, we're made of mud)
(Made of mud, we're made of mud)

It used to be that
Everyone you'd see was so well scrubbed
Everything's different now
Ever since the monsters of mud
