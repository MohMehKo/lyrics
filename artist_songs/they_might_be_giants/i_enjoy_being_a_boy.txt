I live in a cucumber castle
On the banks of a cranberry sea
And starfish dance under my drawbridge
And the blackbirds make nest in my tree

I enjoy being a boy in love with you

In the midst of a strawberry stream
Mellifluous bells ring out softly
From a hill of vanilla fudge cream

I enjoy being a boy in love with you
Ay-ay-ay-ay
I enjoy being a boy in love with you
In love with you, girl
Oh, yea-yuh

I enjoy being a boy in love with you
Ay-ay-ay-ay
I enjoy being a boy in love with you
In love with you, girl
Oh yea-yuh
