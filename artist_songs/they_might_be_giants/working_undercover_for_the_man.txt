I've been working hard, trying to sing and play guitar
Growing out my hair and practicing my stare
Paid to fake it in a traveling band
And I'm working undercover for the man
Sha-la-la-la-la sha-la-la-la-la-la

Planning midnight raids on our unsuspecting fans
While the roadies rig the video surveillance van
Paid to fake it in a traveling band
And I'm working undercover for the man
Sha-la-la-la-la sha-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la sha-la-la-la-la-la

I've been working hard, practicing to sing and play guitar
Growing out my hair and working on my stare
Paid to fake it in a traveling band
And I'm working undercover for the man
Sha-la-la-la-la sha-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la sha-la-la-la-la-la
