Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain, chain of fools

Five long years I thought you were my man
But I found out I'm just a link in your chain
You got me where you want me
I ain't nothing but your fool
You treated me mean, ohh yeah, you treated me cruel oh yeah
Chain, chain, chain, chain of fools

Every chain has got a weak link
Now, I might be weak child, but I'll give you strength 
Well you tell me to leave you alone
My father said come on home
My doctor said take it easy 
Whole bunch of lovin is much too strong
I'm added to your chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain, chain

One of these mornings the chain is gonna break 
But up until then, child, I'ma take all I can take
