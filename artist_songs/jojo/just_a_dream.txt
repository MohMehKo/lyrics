(3, 4) 

I paint my nails black, cuz it fits my mood 
I'm tired of lookin' around for something to prove 
You don't know how it feels inside my skin 
But neither do I, because I numb the feeling 
Take it away, all of my pain 
I gotta bottle I need to finish 
Take it away, take it from me 
Cuz if you don't, I might drown in it 

And I keep tellin' ma, tellin' ma, tellin' myself 
That my bad luck's gonna go away 
And I keep tryin' and tryin' and try, try to win 
But I'm losing every day 
I wanna get up and fight, but I don't have the time 
I'm too busy feelin' sorry for me 
When it looks like the clouds are gone 
I wake up, it was just a dream, it was just a dream 
It was just a dream, it was all a dream 

I walk around, cold to the warmth of life 
I see ya tryin' to talk, but I'm deaf to lies 
Right, I believe in promises of tomorrow 
If I don't make it there, know that I'm that sorry, though 
Take it away, take it from me 
Cuz I really wanna believe 
After the rain, someone'll say 
There's really more for me 

I keep tellin' ma, tellin' ma, tellin' myself 
That my bad luck's gonna go away 
And I keep tryin' and tryin' and try, try to win 
But I'm losing every day 
I wanna get up and fight, but I don't have the time 
I'm too busy feelin' sorry for me 
When it looks like the clouds are gone 
I wake up, it was just a... 

See, I've been through Hell and I am still yet to come back 
There is no conductor to get this on track 
I have dreams of freedom from the circumstance I'm in 
If it's in His plans for me, then I will win 
I'll just dream til' then 

I keep tellin' ma, tellin' ma, tellin' myself 
That my bad luck's gonna go away 
And I keep tryin' and tryin' and try, try to win 
But I'm losing every day 
I wanna get up and fight, but I don't have the time 
I'm too busy feelin' sorry for me 
When it looks like the clouds are gone 
I wake up, it was just a dream, it was just a dream 
It was just a dream, it was all a dream 
It was just a dream
