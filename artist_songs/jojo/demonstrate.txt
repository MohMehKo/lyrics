I live in this fantasy where everything is amplified
Senses hiding in a flash and everything just comes alive
This pressure all inside of me is sexual anxiety

Baby there's a lot of freaky shit running my mind that
I can't say, but I know I can demonstrate
And I can let my body explain
I know I can demonstrate
So I'ma make it simple and plain
You just need to come over
I can just demonstrate

I'm arrested by the night and only you can set me free
Guilty but I'm not ashamed, I'm exactly where I wanted to be (yeah)
I leave the door open wide in hopes that you will sneak inside

Baby there's a lot of freaky shit running my mind that
I can't say, but I know I can demonstrate
And I can let my body explain
I know I can demonstrate
So I'ma make it simple and plain
You just need to come over (come over)
I can just demonstrate

I'm thinking come over, come over, come over
I'm thinking come over, come over
I'm thinking

Baby there's a lot of freaky shit running my mind that
I can't say, but I know I can demonstrate (I know I can)
And I can let my body explain
I know I can demonstrate
So I'ma make it simple and plain
Come over so I can demonstrate
(Come over)
