What am I doing'  
Watchin' all his movements  
Pullin' apart everything that he's doing  
What is the reason at switchin' up free stuff  

Like I'm held up by the police  
I need freedom  

And I'm just not myself  
Need control, cause I just don't have any left  
Only way to explain it  
The water is tainted  

There's Something In The Water  
Somebody help me out  
Cause there's something in my system  
The doctors haven't found  
But I know it's there  
Damn it I know it's there  
I really want him  
It's gettin' stronger  
Feel like I'm drowning  
Don't drink the water  
Just put your glasses down  
Cause there's something in the water  

This isn't like me  
I really don't like this  
Somebody must've taken my Fiji and spiked it  
Fish outta water  
I'm pushin' ya farther  
He calls, I act like I don't wanna be bothered  

But I can't help myself  
I'm in deep, feel like I'm runnin' out of breath  
Only way to explain it  
The water is tainted  

There's something in the water  
Somebody help me out  
'Cause there's something in my system  
The doctors haven't found  
But I know it's there  
Damn it I know it's there  
I really want him  
It's gettin' stronger  
Feels like I'm drownin'  
Don't drink the water  
Just put your glasses down  
'Cause there's something in the water  

There's something in the water  
Somebody help me out  
'Cause there's something in my system  
The doctors haven't found  
But I know it's there  
Damn it I know it's there  
I really want him  
It's gettin' stronger  
Feelin' like I'm drownin'  
Don't drink the water  
Just put your glasses down  
'Cause there's something in the water
