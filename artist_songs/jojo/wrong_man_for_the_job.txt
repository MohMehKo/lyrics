You're the wrong man for the job 
Hmmmmm 

[Verse 1:]
I thought that you were the best part of me 
Baby, I guess that we just believe what we wanna believe 
I thought I knew you so well 
I couldn't tell 
that this was sinking so deep 
I see it now 
I'm breathing now 
It's time for me for me to let it go 

It was cool when it started but now the flame is gone 
You're the wrong man for the job 
My heart is breaking in pieces, but still I'm moving on 
You're the wrong man for the job 
I can't believe it took me so long to realize 
Finally knows what it feels like (wrong man for the job) 
I started moving but I wont be afraid 
I'm sorry to say 
You're the wrong man for the job 

Ohh ohh 

[Verse 2:]
Sometimes I wish I could take back everything 
It'd be easier to never have known you 
I would spare myself so much pain 
But still I can't stop thinkin bout what I'm do without 
You in the lonely nights 
But now I know what I gotta do 
I can't ever change you 
I'm letting it go tonight 

Hey! 
It was cool when it started but now the flame is gone 
You're the wrong man for the job 
My heart is breaking in pieces, but still I'm moving on 
You're the wrong man for the job 
I can't believe it took me so long to realize 
Finally knows what it feels like (wrong man for the job) 
I start to move but I wont be afraid 
I'm sorry to say 
You're the wrong man for the job 

[Breakdown:]
I'm looking for somebody to love me the way I should be loved 
I need someone to do more for me than you've ever done 
I love but you're not the one 

It was cool when it started but now the flame is gone 
You're the wrong man for the job 
My heart is breaking in pieces, but still I'm moving on 
You're the wrong man for the job 
I can't believe it took me so long to realize 
Finally knows what it feels like (you're the wrong man for the job) 
I started moving but I wont be afraid 
I'm sorry to say 
You're the wrong man for the job 

Heyeyy 
You're the wrong man for the job [x2]
