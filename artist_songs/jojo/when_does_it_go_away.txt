[Garland:]
I swear we both used to say
That we would never walk away
Now when I see your face,
It's like you never felt the same
Explain to me

[Chorus:]
How are you okay?
I can't be around you.
Don't you feel pain that I feel without you?
Cause I have to pretend that you don't make a difference, it's the lie that I'm living in.
When it does it go away, when does it go away, when does it go away?

[JoJo:]
Baby, my worst mistake
Was letting you ever get away, away from me.
And I couldn't see everything
When it was right there in my face
And baby it's killing me

[Chorus:]
How are you okay?
I can't be around you.

Don't you feel pain that I feel without you?
Cause I have to pretend that you don't make a difference, it's the lie that I'm living in.
When it does it go away, when does it go away, when does it go away?

[Garland:]
I heard them say that times heals everything.
Every second without you, I'm going insane.
Ain't nothing in the world can help me now, help me now, ooooh.

[JoJo:]
I told myself that today I'm moving on.
I can't even breathe now that your'e gone, you're my everything.
Let me know when does it go away.

[Chorus:]
How are you okay?
I can't be around you.
Don't you feel pain that I feel without you?
Cause I have to pretend that you don't make a difference, it's the lie that I'm living in.
When it does it go away, when does it go away, when does it go away, when does it go away, when does it go away?
