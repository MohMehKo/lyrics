Let's take a ride, take ya somewhere nice
Let me see your face, in the neon lights
Got ya full attention
Lemme whisper in your ear
No need for questions
Let me make it crystal clear

I can be your angel
Even if it's for one night
If you show me somethin' special
I can show you what you like
What you, what you like

Girl, I understand
Ya say you wanna take your time
But I can see already, that you're gonna change your mind
Got your full attention
You're pullin' me right out the door
Gotta know just what you're thinkin'
So tell me what ya have in store

I can be your angel
Even if it's for one night
If you show me somethin' special
I can show you what you like
What you, what you like

I know a place where we can get away
Get into whatever boy as long as it's you and me
And baby, I know a place where we can be alone
Baby, tonight, (tonight) tonight (tonight)

(What you like)

I can be your angel
Even if it's for one night
If you show me somethin' special
I can show you what you like

Don't get confused
You don't have to choose
Cause it's on the table
And it's all for you
Boy, I wanna get down, down, down, on the floor right now
If you wanna keep my attention
Well baby, let me show you how

I know a place where we can get away
Get into whatever boy as long as it's you and me
And baby, I know a place where we can be alone
Baby, tonight, (tonight) tonight (tonight)

I know a place where we can get away
Get into whatever boy as long as it's you and me
And baby, I know a place where we can be alone
Baby, tonight, (tonight) tonight (tonight)
(What you, what you like)
What you like
(What you, what you like)
