I love a boy without a heart. 
I'm but a string on his guitar. 
He would never know that I'm in pain, 
Waiting for a song that he can't play. 

I was confident the night we met, 
The moment was so strong. 
Like a piece of bubblegum, 
Sweet at first but it don't last that long. 
Now I'm filled with insecurities, 
It's time to spit you out. 

'Cause you, you'll never change, 
The games that you play, 
It's just who you are. 
And I, have to believe, 
It's you and not me, 
The boy without a heart. 

Yaaaaaayyyyaaaayyy 

I love a boy who doesn't feel. 
Believes what he says until it's real. 
All that I want, you can be, 
But you can not pretend that long for me. 

I was beautiful the day we met, 
But now I'm not so sure. 
Awkward and alone you, 
You don't make me feel sexy anymore. 
I'm snapping myself out of it, 
I gotta close this door. 

'Cause you, you'll never change, 
The games that you play, 

It's just who you are (just who you are). 
And I, have to believe, 
It's you and not me, 
The boy without a, the boy without a, 
The boy without a heart. 

Oooooooo 

I just like to think that I, 
Deserve a nice respectable guy. 
So why am I here at your door, at your door. 
If I was sane, I'd take my crazy behind, 
And get back in my BMW, 
'Cause I'm a self-made woman, 
And someones gunna treat me better than you do (ha). 

I just need ta, I just need ta calm down. 

'Cause you, you'll never change, 
The games that you play (the games that you play), 
It's just who you are (just who you are). 
And I, have to believe (And I I ....believe), 
It's you and not me (It's you and not me), 
The boy without a heart (the boy without a, the boy without a heart). 

'Cause you, you'll never change, 
The games that you play (Oooooo....you'll never change), 
It's just who you are (just who you are). 
And I, have to believe (I just have to believe for my sanity), 
It's you and not me (Oooo), 
The boy without a heart (the boy without a, the boy without a hmmm).
