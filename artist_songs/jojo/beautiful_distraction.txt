I’m late for work again, the second time this week
I haven’t called my friends, they’re worried about me
I need some help I’m not myself you got me in a daze, for days
When I am in your arms it’s like I just can’t stop it

I’m crashing into cars
I’m running into trees
I do these things because your love’s affecting me
Can’t control my reaction, what a beautiful distraction.

You take over my mind, I can’t finish a thought (I can’t think)
My vision turns to blind & I can’t connect the dots
I’m helpless & I’m stuck on how it feels here next to you
I do (I do) believe that this is dangerous
But I can’t stop it ’cause

I’m crashing into cars
I’m running into trees
I do these things because your love’s affecting me
Can’t control my reaction (can’t control it)
What a beautiful distraction.

From the heat of your lips
To the look in your eyes
I just can’t resist enough for me to find time
I’m gonna turn off my phone
I’m gonna turn off the lights
I don’t want a distraction from a distraction
And I’m always thinking about it
Whether it’s wrong or right
I just can’t stop it

I’m crashing into cars
I’m running into trees
I do these things because your love’s affecting me
Can’t control my reaction (I can’t control it, no)
What a beautiful distraction.
What a beautiful distraction!
