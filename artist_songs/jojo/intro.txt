Rest your head and close your eyes
Everything will be okay
When you wake with the sweet sunrise
It'll be a brand new day
Relax your body and let all of life's worries melt away
For when you wake with the warm summer sun
It'll be a brand new day
Fall fast asleep and dream with me
Whisper I love you
I'm here to stay
For when we wake
