Ooooooh...
All my girls got issue with you
'Cause I don't show no more like I used to
For them, lately I'm not in the mood
They don't know what for,
So they don't like you
Fuck, they don't have to

Let them be mad at you baby
'Cause I got it bad for you baby
You give me the sweetest hangover,
That I don't wanna be over
So let them be mad at you baby
'Cause I got it bad for you baby
You give me the sweetest hangover,
That I don't wanna be over

Oh no, no, no, no (Oh no, no)
Oh no, no, no, no (Oh no, no)
Oh no, no, no (Oh no, no, no)
Oh no, no, no (Oh no, no, no)

Ooooooh...
They think I'm addicted to you
And of that they're sure, oh baby it's cool
Because then my sickness is you
And I don't need no cure

So they don't like you
Well, they don't have to
Let them be mad at you baby
'Cause I got a bet for you baby
If you give me the sweetest hangover,
Then I don't wanna be over
So let them be mad at you baby
'Cause I got a bet for you baby
If you give me the sweetest hangover,
Then I don't wanna be over

Oh no, no, no (Oh no, no)
Oh no, no, no (Oh no, no)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no (Oh no, no, no)
No, no, no, no, no (Oh no, no)
