(Around the world, around the world) 
(Around the world, around the world) 
(Around the world, around the world) 
(Around the world, around the world) 
(Around the world, around the world) 
(Around the world) 

I can't lie I'm so hot 
Every time I'm with you 
Where we go, I never know 
But you do the most 
Every time I'm with you 

When I think, when I think 
Think about, think about 
What you do, what you do 
I go to another place in my mind 
When I think, when I think 
Think about, think about 
What you do, what you do 
I just wanna be with you all the time 

Can't ever let you go, you gotta know 
I lose control, when you take me there 
When you're dreaming too, don't ever wake me 
Cuz everything you do takes me 
(Around the world, around the world) 
Takes me, takes me (around the world, around the world) 
Takes me, takes me (around the world, around the world) 
Takes me, takes me (around the world, around the world) 
Takes me, takes me 

Look at me, I'm falling deep 
Deeper than I've ever been before 
I admit, you're the perfect fit 
I'm so convinced I've never been so sure 

When I think, when I think 
Think about, think about 
What you do, what you do 
I go to another place in my mind 
When I think, when I think 
Think about, think about 
What you do, what you do 
I just wanna be with you all the time 

Can't ever let you go, you gotta know 
I lose control, when you take me there 
When you're dreaming too, don't ever wake me 
Cuz everything you do takes me 
(Around the world, around the world) 
Takes me, takes me (around the world, around the world) 
Takes me, takes me (around the world, around the world) 
Takes me, takes me (around the world, around the world) 
Takes me, takes me 

All around the world, all around the world 
All around the world, all around the world 
Tokyo, Mardi Gras, Boston, here we all go 
London to L.A., Denver, East Chicago, go 

Can't ever let you go, you gotta know 
I lose control, when you take me there 
When you're dreaming too, don't ever wake me 
Cuz everything you do takes me 
(Around the world, around the world) 
Takes me, takes me (around the world, around the world) 
Takes me, takes me (around the world, around the world) 
Takes me, takes me (around the world, around the world) 
Takes me, takes me 

You take me, take me 
All around the world, all around the world 
(Around the world, around the world) 
(Around the world, around the world) 
(Around the world, around the) 
All around the world, all around the world
