Uhoh Yeah Yeahhh Ohh 

The way you're part of me, 
I would have to re-learn everything, 
If you were to leave, 
So fast you make me fall like I was autumn leaves, 
And, honestly.. 
There a perfect explination 
Why you feel so good to say that you're 

[Chorus:]
My love, my love, my love 
I'll give you all my love if you, if you, 
If you dont change a thing, 
About the way you hold me everynight, 
So right, I wanna man like you forever in my life. 

I'm locked inside a jar, 
Turn the lid and set me free, 
I love everything that you are, 
Has a million other reasons, 
But lets not go to far, 
Stay, close to my heart, 
When I think about the future, 
I am right there where you are, 
Cos you're... 

[Chorus:]
My love, my love, my love 
I'll give you all my love if you, if you, 
If you dont change a thing, 
About the way you hold me everynight, 
So right, I wanna man like you to say you're, 

My love, my love, my love 
I'll give you all my love if you, if you, 
if you dont change a thing, 
About the way you hold me everynight, 
So right, I wanna man like you forever in my life. 

I know, that you, would never leave me hanging, 
Hanging out to dry in the wind, 
I know that we haven't seen the worst of it, 
But when we do, I promise you we'll stick it out together. 
You're.. 

[Chorus 2x:]
My love, my love, my love 
I'll give you all my love if you,if you, 
If you dont change a thing, 
About the way you hold me everynight, 
So right, I wanna man like you forever in my life. 

So right, I wanna man like you forever in my lifeeeeee..
