My phone keeps ringing, my boyfriend's beeping me; he can't get a hold of me.
Not because I don't hear, but I know I can't answer with this kind of company.
I'm not gonna lie, it's one of those nights that I'm not too proud to share.
I never thought it'd be me barking up the wrong tree; but I am.

What would he do, if he knew what was really going on.
He would probably seal the deal and I'd be left alone.

Cause... he doesn't know that I'm kissing another man while he's missing me.
He wouldn't see any difference cause my secret is safe with me.
I know I shouldn't keep anything from him, but I'm hiding away because I love him.
I lock the door and threw away the key.
And it's safe with me.
(Safe with me)

When I'm with my man, I don't got to pretend, cause my heart feel like it's home.
But the second I leave, I loose track of my feet and I run to another's arms.
I'm not a bad girl, It's just a big world,
Don't wanna feel like I'm missing out.
So many fish in the lake, didn't know I was bait, but I am.

What would he do, if he knew what was really going on.
I know he would seal the deal and I'd be left alone.

He doesn't know that I'm kissing another man while he's missing me.
He wouldn't see any difference cause my secret is safe with me.
I know I shouldn't keep anything from him, but I'm hiding away because I love him.
I lock the door and throw away the key.
And it's safe with me.

He's good man, he's a good friend.
He would never do what I be doing.
Don't deserve him, don't wanna hurt him.
But if I tell him, he'll leave.

He doesn't know.
Not gonna tell him.
He doesn't know.
He doesn't know...

He doesn't know that I'm kissing another man while he's missing me.
He wouldn't see any difference cause my secret is safe with me.
I know I shouldn't keep anything from him, but I'm hiding away because I love him.
I lock the door and throw away the key.
And it's safe with me.
And it's safe with me.

I know I shouldn't keep anything from him, but I'm hiding away because I love him.
I lock the door and throw away the key.
And it's safe with me.
