Lady luck and four leaf clovers
They don't ease this hurt I feel all over
My life is one special occasion
To relieve the dent in a situation

Standing on a shaky ground
Ever since you put me down
I'm standing on a shaky ground
Ever since you put me down

My car got repossessed this morning
Hard times, I haven't seen in years
Boy you better throw me a life preserver
I'm about to drown in my own tears

Standing on a shaky ground
Ever since you put me down
I'm standing on a shaky ground
Ever since you put me down

Hey now now, standing on a shaky ground
Ever since you put me down
Standing on a shaky ground
Ever since you put me down

Standing on a shaky ground
Ever since you gon' and put me down
Now I'm on a shaky ground, shaky ground
