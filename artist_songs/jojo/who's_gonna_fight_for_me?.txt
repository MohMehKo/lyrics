Everybody got what they paid for tonight
Ain’t just a ‘one weekend’ lie
Never feel the heat, the light
I hate to see ‘em walk away
And home is where the battle lies
It ain’t right
I’ve been wrestling myself
Reaching out for help for a long, long time

Thinking over; drinking, sober
Look around for something to hold onto
If not a lover, who’ll be my cover?

Who’s gonna fight for me?
Will anybody fight for the fighter?
Does anybody know where to find her?
‘Cause maybe I just need a reminder
That no one’s gonna rescue me
No, I’m not just sitting alone
I gotta learn to stand on my own
‘Cause I’m the only one in the rain
Who’s gonna fight for me?
Who's gonna fight for me?

It’s just me and my victory
But what does it really mean?
There’s nobody around to see
I’ll never let ‘em see me cry
What is the reason I keep on believing?
That I’mma find something to hold on to
If not a lover, who’ll be my cover?

Who’s gonna fight for me?
Will anybody fight for the fighter?
Does anybody know where to find her?
‘Cause maybe I just need a reminder
That no one’s gonna rescue me
No, I’m not just sitting alone
I gotta learn to stand on my own
‘Cause I’m the only one in the rain
Who’s gonna fight for me?

It’s so exciting
Been pushing me over my limit
Sometimes I wonder if I’m even meant to be in it 
But baby, I’m not a quitter 
So I’mma stand with my chin up 
At the end of the day 
I know that I’m gonna win it, yeah

Will anybody fight for the fighter?
Does anybody know where to find her?
‘Cause maybe I just need a reminder
Who’s gonna fight for me?
Will anybody fight for the fighter?
Does anybody know where to find her?
‘Cause maybe I just need a reminder
That no one’s gonna rescue me
No, I’m not just sitting alone
I gotta learn to stand on my own
‘Cause I’m the only one in the rain
Who’s gonna fight for me?
Who's gonna fight for me?
Who's gonna fight for me?
