[Phone call]
Hello? I'm out right now, just been drinking, Jack
What are you doing, I miss you
You wanna come over?
Oh who you with? Are you alone?

[Verse 1]
I've been up three days
Adderall and Redbull
This call is a mistake
There’s something strong in this water bottle
I hear you got a new chick
A dancing little Barbie doll
I feel so pathetic
But you still haven’t heard it all

[Chorus]
Fuck that new girl that you like so bad
She’s not crazy like me, I bet you like that
I said fuck that new girl that’s been in your bed
And when you’re in her I know I’m in your head
(Are you drunk right now?)
I’m just saying you could do better
Always turned you out every time we were together
(You know I didn't mean that)
Once you had the best boy you can’t do better
(You should come over, what are you doing?)
Baby I’m the best so you can’t do better

(oh oh oh oh oh)

(Right)

[Verse 2]
I ran into your homeboys
They’re all fucking idiots
You’re not even my boyfriend
But they're tripping 'cause I’m in the club
Yeah, that’s right I’m dancing
And something cool is in my cup
I’ma send a sexy picture
To remind you what you’ve given up

[Chorus]
Fuck that new girl that you like so bad
She’s not crazy like me, I bet you like that
I said fuck that new girl that’s been in your bed
And when you’re in her I know I’m in your head
(Right)
I mean, I’m just saying you could do better
Always turned you out every time we were together
Once you had the best, boy, you can’t do better
Baby, I’m the best so you can’t do better
(Baby, I’m the best so you can’t do better)

No, you can't do better
Right, yeah
Right
