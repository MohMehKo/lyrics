The way I see it, you said you just can’t win it
Everybody’s in it for their own game
You can’t please them all
There's always someone calling you down

I do my best and I do good business
There’s a lot of people asking for my time
Trying to get ahead, trying to be a good friend of mine

But I was a free man in paris
I felt infetted and alive
There was no one callin me up for favors
And no one’s future to decide
You know I’d go back there tomorrow
If all the work I’ve taken on
And start make a machinery,
Behind the popular song

I deal in dreamers and terrible screamers
Lately I wonder why I do it for
If I had my way, I’d just walk through those doors

And one day, down the Champs Elysee,
Going café to cabaret, looking now I feel when I find
A very good friend of mine

I was a free man in paris
I felt infetted and alive
There was no one callin me up for favors
And no one’s future to decide
You know I’d go back there tomorrow
If all the work I’ve taken on
And start make a machinery,
Behind the popular song
