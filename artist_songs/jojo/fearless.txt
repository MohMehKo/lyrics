Everybody's got a place for me but where do I fit in
If every morning is a brand new canvas
What colors will I use today to fill it in
And I've got tendencies to draw outside the lines
So will you still love me
Even if my castle ain't built by your design

All of the scene I've seen in the mirror
It's all just connecting but that's if I let it
All of the demons that I'm fighting daily
I won't let them get me (no no 'cause..)

Life is for the fearless
Nobody wants to hear this
It's all about the madness
You make beautiful
If love is what your afraid of
Then it's time to get creative
Just you and that old paint brush
Make it beautiful (make it beautiful)

I don't like Mondays I'd rather lie in bed
Some times it's safer underneath my blankets
With the dreams inside my head
And I got tendencies to see things black and white
That gray area seems frightening, exciting part of love

All of the scene I've seen in the mirror
It's all just connecting but that's if I let it
All of the demons that I'm fighting daily
I wont let them get me (no no no 'cause..)

Life is for the fearless
Nobody wants to hear this
It's all about the madness
You make beautiful
If love is what your afraid of
Then it's time to get creative
Just you and that old paint brush
Make it beautiful (make it beautiful)

Cold strokes, strange shapes
Don't make sense of the time
Bright shades let your imagination go wild
Part of your choices but which one to make
And all of these boundaries I'm breaking away
And I can't wait
I can't wait...

Life is for the fearless
Nobody wants to hear this
It's all about the madness
You make beautiful (you make beautiful)
If love is what your afraid of
Then it's time to get creative
Just you and that old paint brush
Make it beautiful
(make it beautiful)
(make it beautiful)
(make it beautiful)

'Cause life is for the fearless
And it's up to you if you make your beautiful..
