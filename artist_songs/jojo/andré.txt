He always fly as he wanna be
Cool than a mother
The girls always looking, but he's just my lover
Andre, Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Andre
Love how you go your own way, Andre
Some people think he's strange
But he never try to hide it
Diamond in the rough, and that's just how I like it
That's my Andre, Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Andre
Love how you go your own way

He wears a leather jacket in June
Got a convo straight to the moon
He's the fire that you can't contain
I get weak just saying his name

So quiet, raspberry beret
No Prince but a king to me
See he got his own rules to the game
After him, I'll never be the same

And we get lifted as the night gets nearer
Vibe gets heavy and the clothes get wetter
I'm a sucker for a guy with a beautiful mind
And he's all mine

He always fly as he wanna be
Cool than a mother
The girls always looking, but he's just my lover
Andre, Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Andre
Love how you go your own way, Andre
Some people think he's strange
But he never try to hide it
Diamond in the rough, and that's just how I like it
That's my Andre, Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Andre
Love how you go your own way

See my man make you wanna invest
Got my heart beating out of my chest
And he sounds like jazz to me
Like he swam right out of my dream

And I love how he go with the flow
Just chilling in our personal fish bowl
And I know it sounds kinda strange
It's a love that you can't explain

And we get lifted as the night gets nearer
Vibe gets heavy and the clothes get wetter
I'm a sucker for a guy with a beautiful mind
And he's all mine

He always fly as he wanna be
Cool than a mother
The girls always looking, but he's just my lover
Andre, Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Andre
Love how you go your own way, Andre
Some people think he's strange
But he never try to hide it
Diamond in the rough, and that's just how I like it
That's my Andre, Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Andre
Love how you go your own way

Probably knew you in some other life
Maybe I was your man and maybe you were my wife
And I wouldn't even question, wouldn't think twice
It all makes perfect sense
And if ever you're still not mine
I guess I'll love you from a distance till the end of time
And I hope we'll be friends on down the line
It all makes perfect sense (Ah, refreshing)

He always fly as he wanna be
Cool than a mother
The girls always looking, but he's just my lover
Andre, Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Andre
Love how you go your own way, Andre
Some people think he's strange
But he never try to hide it
Diamond in the rough, and that's just how I like it
That's my Andre, Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Andre
Love how you go your own way

He always fly as he wanna be
Cool than a mother
The girls always looking, but he's just my lover
Andre, Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Andre
Love how you go your own way, Andre
Some people think he's strange
