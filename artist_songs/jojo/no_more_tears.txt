Got my damn mascara running down my face
Crying buckets in the bathroom of this place
In the mirror, asking how could this be
Suddenly the mirror started talking back at me
It said "what the hell you doing?
baby wipe your face, girl those tears are special, don't let em go to waste.
pull yourself together cause we gon be okay,
walk right up to him & that chick and this is what you say"

[Chorus:]
You ain't worth my tears
You ain't worth my time
There ain't no love here
And I'm gon be just fine
You ain't worth my tears
On to something new
No more tears for you
No more tears for you
There'll be no more tears for you

And I'm alright, fix my hair make sure my makeup's reapplied
Regain my composure get back in my stride
Said to the mirror, your new start is right outside
Walk up out the bathroom
He won't see me coming, he's sitting in the corner with a girl & not a woman
When I walk up, such a scared look on his face (hey)
And I just smile & this is what I say

[Chorus:]
You ain't worth my tears
You ain't worth my time
There ain't no love here
And I'm gon be just fine
You ain't worth my tears
On to something new
No more tears for you
No more tears for you
There'll be no more tears for you

I have the right to knock her out that chair (hey)
But I'm a lady, so I won't take it there
I can not believe that I shed tears for you
But with dry eyes I'm telling you we're through.

[Chorus]

I wasted to many on you and now there's no more tears for you
Said there's no more tears for you
Said there's no more tears for you
Said there's no more tears for you
No more tears, there'll be no more tears for you
