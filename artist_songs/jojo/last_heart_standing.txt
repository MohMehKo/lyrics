You think you'll wear me down, eh?
You think I'll fall just like rain?
You think you'll get in my brain?
Don’t think so, no

You think you'll get me so weak,
And knock me off of my feet?
You think you'll sneak in my dreams?
Oh no you, won't

Goodbye, bye, bye
You’re wasting all your time, time, time
So go ahead and try, try, try
I won’t be one more name on your wall of shame

And you’ll see, I won’t go down so easily
You won’t bring me down to my knees
I’m gonna be the last heart standing, the last heart standing
I’m too tough, to let you get me tripped up
Won’t be no casualty of your love
I’m gonna be the last heart standing, the last heart standing

I’m gonna be the last heart, yeah

You think you'll change my mind, eh?
And take up all my time, eh?
Think you should know there’s no way that’s going down

You think you’re gonna win this,
And get me swept up in this?
But oh no, you must be tripping
Cause I’m standing my ground

So try, try, try
You’re only gonna find, find, find
You’re wasting all your time, time, time
I won’t be one more name on your wall of shame

And you’ll see, I won’t go down so easily
You won’t bring me down to my knees
I’m gonna be the last heart standing, the last heart standing
I’m too tough, to let you get me tripped up
Won’t be no casualty of your love
I’m gonna be the last heart standing, the last heart standing

After all the other hearts all fall
This time I'll be standing tall
I won’t play this game
You won’t win this fight
Why you even trying?
Why you wasting your time?

You’ll see, I won’t go down so easy
You won't bring me down to my knees
I’m gonna be the last heart standing, the last heart
I’m too tough to let you get me tripped up
Won’t be no casualty of your love
I’m gonna be the last heart standing, the last heart, heart

I'm gonna be the last heart, yeah

I'm gonna be the last heart standing, 

The last heart standing
