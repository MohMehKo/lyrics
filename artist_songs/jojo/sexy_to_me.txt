Mind, check
Body, check
My sensuality, check
Car keys and my paycheck
Now I'm ready
DANGER

Tonight I'm a bit crazy
Only the music can save me
It's over over, oh baby

You a man today
Tomorrow you gonna hate me
I'm not myself tonight
Got a water bottle filled with something else tonight
It's gonna be, alright
As soon as they cut off these lights

'Cause the beat came on 
The ground just shook
And it feels so good, it feels so good
I know what you think it's understood

Do you get it? 
Got it?
Good

When I do my thing, they all gonna look
And it feels so good, it feels so good
If you call my phone, it's off the hook

Do you get it? 
Got it? 
Good

I don't need nobody 
'Cause I'm sexy to me (Ooh yeah)

You keep doing you tonight 
'Cause I'm doing me (Ooh yeah)
We gonna rock the party like we up in Ibiza, yeah

I don't need nobody 
'Cause I'm sexy to me (Ooh yeah)

Wanna be mad? 
Well, o-kay kay
I'll be in the booth with the DJ
Free shots all around it's my b-day
Get a little he-he like MJ.

'Cause the beat came on 
The ground just shook
And it feels so good, it feels so good
I know what you think it's understood

Get it? Got it? Good
When I do my thing, they all gonna look
And it feels so good, it feels so good
If you call my phone it's off the hook

Do you get it?
Got it? 
Good.

I don't need nobody 
'Cause I'm sexy to me (Ooh yeah)

You keep doing you tonight 
'Cause I'm doing me (Ooh yeah)

We gonna rock the party like we up in Ibiza, yeah
I don't need nobody 
'Cause I'm sexy to me (Ooh yeah)

Everybody say,

'Cause I'm sexy to me (Ooh yeah)

You keep doing you tonight 
'Cause I'm doing me, ooh yeah
We gonna rock the party like we up in Ibiza, yeah

I don't need nobody 
'Cause I'm sexy to me (Ooh yeah)
