Unthinkable, me leavin' you
It feels like we got somethin' for the record books
But you're unbearable, with the things you do
Every now and then I stop and take a second look

Half the time I don't know who you are
You're inconsistent, switchin' up your heart
I can't take this back and forth
It's killing me, you're about to push me away

Who are you?
Turn it, can ya tell me
Who are you?
Are you still my baby?
I thought I did, but I don't know who you are
Makes it impossible to love you

Baby, it's like I'm spinnin' around
The way I feel, I don't know if we're up or if we're down
I thought I did, but I don't know who you are
It's so impossible, impossible to love you
But I do, But I do

Unspeakable, the words I feel
So I keep em' to myself to spare you, baby
Unbreakable, 'cause I know it's real
Even when you're on the edge and talkin' crazy

Half the time I don't know who you are
You're inconsistent, switchin' up your heart
I can't take this back and forth
It's killing me, you're about to push me away

Who are you?
Turn it, can ya tell me
Who are you?
Are you still my baby?
I thought I did, but I don't know who you are
Makes it impossible to love you

Baby, it's like I'm spinnin' around
The way I feel, I don't know if we're up or if we're down
I thought I did, but I don't know who you are
It's so impossible, impossible

Don't know what it is you do to me
Or understand what you're goin' through with me
But it's impossible for me to live without you and me
I'm tryin' hard as I can to see
I'm holdin' long as I can to keep
You here I just need my man with me
I need to understand
Who are you?

Who are you?
Turn it, can ya tell me
Who are you?
Are you still my baby?
I thought I did, but I don't know who you are
Makes it impossible to love you

Baby, it's like I'm spinnin' around
The way I feel, I don't know if we're up or if we're down
I thought I did, but I don't know who you are
It's so impossible, impossible to love you
