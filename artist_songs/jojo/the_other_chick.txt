[Verse 1:]
You told me that she's the girl you just look down on
La La La Bum Bum La La La La
You love me more 'cause I’m the one you put your mouth on
La La La Bum Bum La La La La
You don’t even look her way
'Cause she's so ‘effin yesterday

But you pull up to the party
She's in the passenger's seat
I thought that girl was a joke
But she's laughing at me

[Chorus:]
Come to find out,
That I’m the other chick
And you never loved me
She was so over me
Now there’s no doubt,
That I’m the other chick
And you never loved me
'Cause I’m just the other chick

[Verse 2:]
So I was just some babe that you eff’d around on
La La La Bum Bum La La La La
I must admit you're good
Oh yeah, you got the crown on
La La La Bum Bum La La La La
I’m so effing yesterday
'Cause you don’t remember my name

I’m so much hotter than her
But I guess you disagree
I thought that girl was a joke
But she's laughing at me

[Chorus:]
Come to find out,
That I’m the other chick
And you never loved me
She was so over me
Now there’s no doubt,
That I’m the other chick
And you never loved me
'Cause I’m just the other chick

[Bridge:]
I had the keys to your car
She had the key to your heart
Such a mistake on your part
Good love can't lie
'Cause I’ll be fine
Oh yeah by the way
I faked it every time

[Chorus x2:]
Come to find out,
That I’m the other chick
And you never loved me
She was so over me
Now there’s no doubt,
That I’m the other chick
And you never loved me
'Cause I’m just the other chick

Other, other...
