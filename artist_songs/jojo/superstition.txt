There is superstitious
Writings on the wall
There is superstitious
Letters 'bout to fall
13th month old baby
Broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
All the good things in your past

When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way

Very superstitious
Wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problems
Do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream
Keep me going strong
You don't want to save me
Sad is my song

When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way
It just ain't the way

Very superstitious
Ain't nothing more to say
Very superstitious
Devil's on his way
13th month old baby
Broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
The good things in your past

When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way
