Laying down on my hardwood floor again
Watching all my deepest fears just crawling on the ceiling
These colonial bricks and beams are just not enough to hold me
All I got is my hopes and dreams and this cranberry slowly

I get by I get by
I get by I get by
I get high I get high
But tomorrow’s goodbye
So I get by I get by
I get by I get by
I get by I get by
Cause tomorrow’s goodbye, yea

I took the Red Line all the way to South E
When I leave this place will anybody really miss me
If I stay on this train all night can I end at the beginning
Smoking on this Cali green to just stop the world from spinning

But I get by I get by
I get by I get by
I get high I get high
Have tomorrow’s goodbye
So we get by we get by
We get by we get by
We get high we get high
Cause tomorrow’s goodbye

Sunset, my wishlist I’ll give you that
Hollywood and the bullshit I deal with that
That life I left, I’m not going back
I can’t work a 9 to 5
I’m getting lost just by myself
Baby I’ll stop being someone else
I’ll take the PCH down to my Cali dream, hey

We get by we get by
We get by we get by
We get high we get high
Cause tomorrow’s goodbye
(Cause tomorrow’s goodbye)

I get by I get by
I get by I get by
I get high I get high
Cause tomorrow’s goodbye
(Cause tomorrow’s goodbye)

We get by we get by
We get by we get by
We get high we get high
Cause tomorrow’s goodbye
(Cause tomorrow’s goodbye)
