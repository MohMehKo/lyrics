(Real baby)
(Real baby)
(Real baby)
(Real baby)

It's like we speak a different language
These double-sided conversations set me up
Keep dodging bullets in the bedroom
But neither one will ever say we've had enough

Help, I can't tell if we're bending until we break down
Say now we're through
Ooh, ooh

When love hurts, baby
(Real baby)
That's how you know it's...
(Real baby)
That's how you know it's real, baby
(Real baby)
That's how you know it's...
(Real baby)
That's how you know that it's real, baby
(Real baby)
That's how you know it's...
(Real baby)
That's how you know that it's real, baby
(Real baby)
That's how you know it's...
(Real baby)
That's how you know that it's real

Those times went through me like a freight train
You're getting off testing my patience 'til it's gone
But again, I do the same thing
But neither one will ever say we've had enough

Help, I can't tell if we're bending until we break down
Say now we're through
All you do

When love hurts, baby
(Real baby)
That's how you know it's...
(Real baby)
That's how you know it's real, baby
(Real baby)
That's how you know it's...
(Real baby)
That's how you know that it's real, baby
(Real baby)
That's how you know it's...
(Real baby)
That's how you know that it's real, baby
(Real baby)
That's how you know it's...
(Real baby)
That's how you know that it's real

Real love
I know I've got a real love
Someone to set my heart free

Real love
Yeah, I know I've got a real love

Real love
I know I've got a real love
Someone to set my heart free

Real love
Yeah, I know I've got a real love

Yeah, yeah

When love hurts, baby
(Real baby)
That's how you know it's...
(Real baby)
That's how you know it's real, baby
(Real baby)
That's how you know it's...
(Real baby)
That's how you know that it's real, baby
(Real baby)
That's how you know it's...
(Real baby)
That's how you know that it's real, baby
(Real baby)
That's how you know it's...
(Real baby)
That's how you know that it's real
