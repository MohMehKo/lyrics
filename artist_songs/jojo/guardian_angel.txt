Roll with me
Yeah yeah
Roll with me
Yeah yeah
Roll with me
Yeah yeah
Roll with me
Yeah yeah

Coldest summer under the covers
Can't change the weather what a bummer
Feels like it's raining all day
Raining on me
On me-ay-ay
Sounds of thunder
Feels like a drummer
Banging on my headache
This is scary
Heart's beating like a cop chase
Like I'm being chased
I'm in a horror movie
'Cause you've been heavy on my mind baby
Like a broken record on replay
Going crazy 'cause I wanna see your face
I wanna see your face, ba-by

I remember it like it was yesterday
We were just rebels on the run
Left me stranded searching for your love

Guardian angel
Oh help me out
Where can you be
Please come back to me
I need my guardian angel
Oh
Why'd you go
I won't be at peace 'til you come back to me
Everybody needs a guardian angel
Oh oh
Oh guardian angel
Oh yeah

Nowadays I'm trippin'
Everything's different
My shadow's missing
I'm in prison
Bars keeping you and me away
Locked up in a cage
Like a tiger yeah
Scratching the walls I'm full of rage
I need a miracle come save me
Going crazy in this lonely world
It's a lonely world baby

I remember it like it was yesterday
We were just rebels on the run
Left me stranded searching for your love

Guardian angel
Oh help me out
Where can you be
Please come back to me
I need my guardian angel
Oh
Why'd you go
I won't be at peace 'til you come back to me
Everybody needs a guardian angel
Oh guardian angel
Oh yeah

My hands are tied
Can you hold me tonight
If it was you I'd sacrifice
I need you now to take the wheel
Angels of the sky
Can you hear my cry
Don't trust myself tonight
Take the wheel guardian angel
Oh why'd you go
I won't be in peace 'til you come back to me
Everybody needs a...

Guardian angel

Oh help me out
Where can you be
Please come back to me
I need my guardian angel
Oh
Why'd you go
I won't be at peace 'til you come back to me
Everybody needs a guardian angel
Oh oh oh
Guardian angel
Oh oh oh
Yeah yeah
Coldest summer under the covers
Can't change the weather what a bummer
