In my mind's eye, life is written in stone
For a long time, thought I should leave it alone
I don't want, I don't need anything distracting me
Then I come to find something behind me
Something that I didn't see
On the blindside, you were waiting for me

See I thought that I knew, everything that I needed to
But then I met you
I didn't know that the stars could align
But it happened right on time
Right on time
But it happened right on time

This is real life, it doesn't go how we plan
In the middle of the daylight, we're walking right into quicksand
Cause we don't need gravity or the Earth under our feet
We can climb on up to heaven, we can sail the seven seas
You're my white knight, and baby, I am your queen, mmmm

See I thought that I knew, everything that I needed to
But then I met you
I didn't know that the stars could align
But it happened right on time
Right on time
But it happened right on time

Say you love, love me forever
Never stop, I'm there for whatever
Near and far, you're always everywhere and everything
Say you love, love me forever
Never stop, I'm there for whatever
Near and far, you're always everywhere and everything
Say you love, love me forever
Never stop, I'm there for whatever
Near and far, you're always everywhere and everything

See I thought that I knew, everything that I needed to
But then I met you
I didn't know that the stars could align
But it happened right on time
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Say you love, love me forever
Never stop, I'm there for whatever
Near and far, you're always everywhere and everything
Say you love, love me forever
Never stop, I'm there for whatever
Near and far, you're always everywhere and everything
Say you love, love me forever
Never stop, I'm there for whatever
Near and far, you're always everywhere and everything
