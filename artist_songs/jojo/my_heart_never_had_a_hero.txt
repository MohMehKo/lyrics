You're the only one who made it through the fire, burning fire
You're the only one who walked the water and made it to the other side
You're the one who took away my feelin of falling
Only one who sees the sun
You know I'm calling
You're the one who took me by the hand
Showed me how to fly

[Bridge:]
And I feel so safe that I'm up in your arms
Nothing can touch when I'm right where you are
You busted through the doors
You came up through the floor
Just in the nick of time to safe me

[Chorus:]
Ahhh, my heart never had a hero
Ohhh, ohh
Ahhh, my heart never had a hero
Ohhh, ohh
When there was no one else
You saved me from myself
Almost gave up on myself
Til you rescued me
Ahhh, my heart never had a hero
A hero, a hero

(Never had a hero, a hero)

Faster the speed of light
You come around, and kill my lonely
Better than the average man
You beat the odds, you so incredible

Ohhh, you are
Never met someone so strong
Never breaks down
Never thought that I'll be loved until you came around
Nothing in this world is like the feeling
Like it when you hold, hold me, hold me

[Bridge:]
And I feel so safe that I'm up in your arms
Nothing can touch when I'm right where you are
You busted through the doors
You came up through the floor
Just in the nick of time to safe me

[Chorus:]
Ahhh, my heart never had a hero
Ohhh, ohh
Ahhh, my heart never had a hero
Ohhh, ohh
When there was no one else
You saved me from myself
Almost gave up on myself
Til you rescued me
Ahhh, my heart heart never had a hero
A hero [x7]
