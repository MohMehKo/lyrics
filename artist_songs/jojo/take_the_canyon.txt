Sometimes I need to paint, you can be my canvas
Sometimes I want to escape, even though it’s selfish

I’m always comin over and smoking you out
Because everything is better with a blunt in your mouth
As the clock strikes twelve I’ll be freaking you out
Make us both forget what we were worried about

Traffic’s jammed on the 405
I hop in the whip ’cause I ain’t got much time
I’m gonna to get you

Fly through the streets like a hawk to the sky
Be in and out like a drive by
I’m going to take the canyon
It feels so good because I know that it’s wrong
Get back home, ain’t nothing going on
I’m going to take the canyon

Sometimes I bite my lips so I don’t slip and say his name
’Cause in these magic moments I get homesick all the same

I’m always comin over and smoking you out
Because everything is better with a blunt in your mouth
If I waited for you, I'd just be waiting alone
So when the clock strikes two, I'll be on my way home

Traffic’s jammed on the 405
I hop in the whip ’cause there's not much time
Damn it I’m gonna to get you

I fly through the streets like a hawk to the sky
Be in and out like a drive by
I’m going to take the canyon
It feels so good because I know that it’s wrong
Get back home, ain’t nothing going on
I’m going to take the canyon

Sippin' Marmalade...

He said he was born to be the other man
(I’m going to take the canyon)
So I got to see him when I get the chance
Baby I’m on my way

I fly through the streets like a hawk to the sky
Be in and out like a drive by
I’m going to take the canyon
It feels so good because I know that it’s wrong
Get back home, ain’t nothing going on
I’m going to take the canyon

Gonna do what I gotta do, gonna get to you...
