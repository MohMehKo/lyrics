Boy there's something special about you
The way you touch me
Makes me think of what I'd do
If we were alone
Baby boy I'm all in
Got my heartbeat in the love
Baby boy I'm falling
Everybody says that I'm crazy
They don't feel the passion 
That I feel you can take me, I'm all yours
But I got a few questions for you

Would you still bring me flowers if you get it?
Still talk to me for hours if you get it?
And will you respect me? cause if not
Then I'm not gonna let it go
So, boy you need to let me know

Before we take it there
Let me know that you'll always be by my side
Before we lay it down tonight
I just want it to be right, baby
Before we take it there
Let me know that you'll still be down for me
Before we lay it down tonight
I just want it to be right, to be right

Boy, you're just my type
And every time we kiss, boy it feels so right
I know I'm young but I'm ready
If you let me know
That you'll be here in the morning
We can go all night
Start on my neck if you wanna get my mood right
Boy I want it bad as you do but I need proof
That nothing's gonna change place

So would you bring me flowers if you get it?
Talk to me for hours if you get it?
Will you still respect me? cause if not
Then I'm not gonna let it go
So, boy you need to let me know

Before we take it there
I wanna know that you'll always be by my side
Before we lay it down tonight
I just want it to be right, yeah
Before we take it there
Let me know that you'll still be down for me
Before we lay it down tonight
I want it to be right, to be right

I feel like I'm falling in love
And boy I wanna give my all to you
But I gotta protect my heart
And I don't wanna regret what we do
That taking this step is gonna mess
With the special thing we have today
And baby let me hear it from you
Cause I can handle the truth
Are you gonna stay?

Before we take it there
Let me know that you'll always be by my side
Before we lay it down tonight
I just want it to be right, to be right
Before we take it there
Let me know if you'll always be by my side
Before we lay it down tonight
I just want it to be right, want it to be right
Before we take it down there
Before we lay it down tonight
