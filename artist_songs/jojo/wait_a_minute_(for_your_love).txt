I been thinking about all of our morning rendez-vous
Watching the sunrise, reflecting in your eyes
I been thinking about how much I hate when you're away
How everytime you're gone is always far too long

Everytime I need a fix of you, I get so lonely
Tell me what's a girl supposed to do?
When I just need you close to me
I wish you could come and stay the night
We could be lovers
You're the only cure to make it right

And I can't
Wait a minute for your love
Wait a minute for your kiss
Wait a minute for your touch
Wait a minute
No, I can't wait
Wait a minute for your love
Wait a minute for your kiss
Wait a minute for your touch
Wait a minute

I'm replaying the very first time shared a kiss
But, when we touched our lips, who knew it'd lead to this?
Can't stop thinking about all the real love you give to me
But it gets so hard knowing you're so damn far away

When you're gone and I'm here missing you, I get so lonely
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
I wanna figure close to me
I wish you could be with me tonight
Cause there is no other
You're the only way to make it right

And I
Wait a minute for your love (you're love)
Wait a minute for your kiss (ooh oh)
Wait a minute for your touch
Wait a minute
No, I can't wait
Wait a minute for your love (oooh)
Wait a minute for your kiss
Wait a minute for your touch (Cause I need you here)
Wait a minute (I can't wait a minute)

For your love (for your love)
For you're more than anything I could dream of (I could dream of)
When it comes to you I just can't get enough
Need you here, don't hesitate
Got me counting down the days till you come back to me

Cause I can't wait
Wait a minute for your love
Wait a minute for your kiss (ooohoooh)
Wait a minute for your touch (your touch)
Wait a minute (I can't wait a minute)
Baby, I...
Wait a minute for your love (Can not wait)
Wait a minute for your kiss (Aaah)
Wait a minute for your touch (dumdumdum)
Wait a minute (I can't wait a minute)
