You know that East Coast girls 
Always say what we mean 
And shy Southern boys 
Often don't say a thing 
But opposites attract 
And you were drawn to me 
And something 'bout you 
Sparked my curiosity 

They say that good guys 
Usually don't come in first 
Good girls fall for bad guys 
But with us it's reverse 
Not your average love song 
Between you and me 
The way the story unfolds 
Defies gravity 

Don't have to put on my makeup 
I can leave out my contacts 
Don't have to dress up for you 
To think I'm beautiful 
If I have a moody day 
I don't have to act like I'm okay 
I'm overdramatic 
And you know how to handle it 
Act natural, be emotional 
Show my insecurities 
And I love the way you love me 
For who I am underneath 
(Who I am underneath) 

They say guys keep conversation 
Short and sweet 
And girls can talk for hours 
Till they put you to sleep 
But you're the one who 
Checks up on me throughout the day 
You stay on the phone 
Even if there's nothing to say 

Most guys that I know 
Like to go out at night 
But you leave that to me 
Cause you're not that type 
And we don't need 
To do anything special to be happy 
We got what we need 
Make each other complete 

Don't have to put on my makeup 
I can leave out my contacts 
Don't have to dress up for you 
To think I'm beautiful 
If I have a moody day 
I don't have to act like I'm okay 
I'm overdramatic 
And you know how to handle it 
Act natural, be emotional 
Show my insecurities 
And I love the way you love me 
For who I am underneath 
(Who I am underneath) 

Layer by layer you unravel me 
Sometimes I am rough around the edges 
But you handle me gently 
And layer by layer I uncover you 
And discover a side of you 
That I never knew underneath 

Don't have to put on my makeup 
I can leave out my contacts 
Don't have to dress up for you 
To think I'm beautiful 
If I have a moody day 
I don't have to act like I'm okay 
I'm overdramatic 
And you know how to handle it 
Act natural, be emotional 
Show my insecurities 
And I love the way you love me 
For who I am underneath 
(Who I am underneath) 

Who I am underneath 
I love you for loving me 
For who I am underneath
