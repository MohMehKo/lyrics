Yeah-eahhh, hmmmm
yeaaahhh

[Chorus:]
I'm not your every day, around the way 
Don't go bar-hoppin', chillin' on the block 
On a cell phone frontin',
Never that, cuz I'm not that kinda girl 
I need to know how you roll 
And how you get down, no drama
Drop my money in the bank
Take me home and meet your mama
Can you handle that?
Cuz I'm that kinda girl 
I'm that kinda girl

[Verse 1:]
Boy you aint impressin' me 
With your jewelry, your designer clothes 
Or the games that you try to play 
Think you need to know, I got my own 
Dont need you for your dough 
Hearin' me, maybe then we can flow, let me know 
Make me smile, maybe we can chill 
Keep it real, show me something I can feel 
Cause I'm not your average ordinary type 
Could you be that kinda guy I like?

[Chorus]

[Verse: 2]
Everytime I be up at the spot, chilling with my crew 
We'll be hanging out, get in a little late 
You start bugging out 
I dont think it's fair 
You don't like the clothes I wear
How I do my hair 
I don't really care
But it's not for you 
And I aint got nothin' to prove 
There cant be any us, if there can't be any trust 
Nothin' to discuss, no doubt 
I'm not that kinda girl to let you play me out 

[Chorus]

[BRIDGE:]
You might take me shopping, but I'm not your property 
If I dont like it, I decided 
I can make it on my own 
As long as we disagree to agree
Down for you and you're down for me 
Baby I'm what you want and we can build a love so strong

[Chorus]

Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh
Not That Kinda Girl
Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh
Not That Kinda Girl
Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh
Do you know what kinda girl I am?
Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh
I'm that kinda girl
ooohoohh-yeaaahh
