[T-Pain cover]

This track makes me feel so good
Better than I would by myself 
Or if I was with anybody else
You make the people say yeahhh yeahhhh...uhh

[Verse 1]
He wanna put me in palace
All the way down in Dallas
When you whisper in my ear, 
Make a phantom just appear like magic 
Mhmm... 
You wanna take me from my mom's house 
To a Cambridge town house 
Louis purses to collect, 
Put some diamonds on my neck 
Is that what you about, boy... 

[Hook]
Brought me in the back 
So we can have a conversation, 
I just need a little meditation 
To think about you and me 

[Chorus]
Oh, I cant believe it 
Ooh ooh he all on me, on me 
I, I, I think he want me, want me 
To be his one and only 
Yeah... 
Ooh I cant believe it 
Ooh ooh he all on me, on me 
I, I, I think he want me, want me 
To be his one and only 
Hmm...yeah 

If you really want it, 
Let me hear you say yeah...yeah...yeah 
If you didnt know 
We make the people say yeah...yeah...yeah 

[Verse 2]
Tryna buy me out the mall 
Throw your paper on it all 
Wrapped in Dolce&Gabbana 
And come over when you wanna get involved, no 
You're so sexy (sexy, sexy) 
But its hard to get me (get me, get me) 
Boy I wanna know your heart and your mind 
Not just your pedigree 
Hmm... 
But you look so good 
So I wanna get to know you 
Maybe dinner or a walk through the city 
Baby just us two 
Mhmm... 

[Hook]
Boy I know you're focused and I dig your concentration, 
I just need a little demonstration 
Talkin' bout you and me 

[Chorus]
