Very timid when you know it's all wrong
You don't want it to be long
I tell you the best way to keep it out of the wind
Trust in no one, not even your closest friend
But if your teeth will bite your tongue
Can't you see where it's coming from?
When you do your thing
Don't let other people peep in your hand

It ain't always what you do
It's who you let see you do it
It ain't always what you do
It's who you let see you do it

All my life I've been taught
That you ain't wrong until you get caught
There's an old saying 
And I believe that it's true
You shouldn't let your right hand now
What your left hand is going to do
But if your teeth will bite your tongue
Can't you see where it's coming from?
When you do your thing
Don't let other people peep your hand

It ain't always what you do
It's who you let see you do it
It ain't always what you do
It's who you let see you do it

Ain't that right, ain't that right?
Ain't that right, ain't that right?
But if your teeth will bite your tongue
Can't you see where it's coming from?
When you do your thing
Don't let other people peep your hand
Peep your hand

It ain't always what you do
It's who you let see you do it
It ain't always what you do
It's who you let see you do it

Ain't that right, ain't that right?
Ain't that right, ain't that right?
Ain't that right, ain't that right?
Ain't that right, ain't that right?
