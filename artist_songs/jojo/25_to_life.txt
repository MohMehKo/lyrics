Evidence is clear there's no room for error boy I fell for you 
Boy you got me going through it going through it baby 
Show up at your spot (Just so I can get next to you) 
Something like a superstar 
Must've been inside edition 
Flicking pictures everywhere you are 
You should know I'm gonna get caught 
Catch me if you can

I'm willing to go before the judge and testify my love 
and put me on the stand and I'll tell them you're the main man 
that I wanna spend my life with 
I'll be your ride or die chick 
Call up the reverend and baby I'm gonna tell him that 
I do love you and if you love me too just say I do 
And kiss your bride, let the people throw the rice 
Honeymoon on an island 
Baby you and I can serve 25 to life
