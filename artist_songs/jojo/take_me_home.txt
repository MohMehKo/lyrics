[Verse 1:]
Take that look of worry
I'm an ordinary man
They don't tell me nothing
So I find out all I can
There's a fire that's been burning
Right outside my door
I can't see it, but I feel it
And it helps me keep me warm
But I-I don't mind
No, I-I don't mind

[Verse 2:]
Sweeps along life and waiting
Still don't know what for
Let's go boy, escaping
I don't worry anymore!
I can't come out to find you
I don't like to go outside
They can turn off my feelings
Like they turning off the lights
But I-I don't mind
No, I-I don't mind
No, I-I don't mind
Oooh, I-I don't mind

[Hook:]
So take, take me home
‘Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
‘Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
‘Cause I don't remember
TAKE, TAKE ME HOME

[Bridge:]
‘Cause I've been the prisoner of my life
And I can see you -

[Verse 3:]
Take that look of worry
Mine's an ordinary life
Working in it's daylight
And sleeping when it's night
I've done not for horizons
I don't wish upon a star
They don't think I listen
But I know who they are!
But I, I don't mind
No, I, I don't mind
No, I-I don't mind
(Oooh, uuuh uh uh)

[Hook:]
So take, take me home
‘Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
‘Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
‘Cause I don't remember
TAKE, TAKE ME HOME
