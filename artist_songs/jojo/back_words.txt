[VERSE 1:]
Back packing bags 
Taking back jackets and giving back keys to your heart 
Back tracking the past 
Baby it's bad 
Can't take it back 

[PRE CHORUS:]
Aw baby I tried 
I tried but I can't stop time 
I tried but I won't rewind 
I tried you know I tried 
I can't go back now I've learned 
Can't use a bridge that's burned (burned) 
Oh oooh 

Imagine if I could 
Imagine if I could 

[CHORUS:]
I wish I could go back and undo 
Start again back with you 
If you didn't hear what you heard 
I wish I could go back 
And take back words 

[VERSE 2:]
Back asking you back 
Looking back tragic 
And wondering what happened to us 
Back talkin you first 
Baby it's bad and I know it hurts 

[PRE CHORUS:]
Aw baby I tried 
I tried but I can't stop time 
I tried but I won't rewind 
I tried you know I tried 
I can't go back now I've learned 
Can't use a bridge that's burned (burned) 
Oh oooh 

Imagine if I could 
Imagine if I could 

[CHORUS:]
I wish I could go back and undo 
Start again back with you 
If you didn't hear what you heard 
I wish I could go back 
And take back words 

[BRIDGE:]
I wanna undo this fight 
I wanna turn down the screams 
I wanna not make you leave 
Wish I had hid your damn keys 
I wanna undial the phone 
I wanna uncuss you out 
I wanna reverse your car and bring you right back to me 
You need to let go of your grudge and I'll let mine go too 
I need to be loving you 

[CHORUS:]
Go back and undo 
Start again back with you 
If you didn't hear what you heard 
I wish I could go back 

Go back and undo 
Start again back with you 
If you didn't hear what you heard 
I wish I could go back 

And take back all the words
