Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose
You’ll time carols being sung by choir and folks dressed up like Eskimos
everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
can help to make the season bright, bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all a glow
We’ll find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa’s on his way
He’s loaded of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother’s child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
So I’m offering this simple phrase to kids from one to 92
So its been said many times many ways:

Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you, you
Merry Christmas...

Its been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas, to you
