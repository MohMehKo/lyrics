Hey, it's Jojo
Welcome to my world

I feel butterflies floating around inside
Whenever I'm with you, I feel butterflies
I feel butterflies floating around inside
Don't know what you do,but I feel butterflies

This emotion you bring

I feel butterflies floating around inside (oh, I feel 'em inside)
Whenever I'm with you, I feel butterflies (butterflies)
I feel butterflies (I feel) floating around inside (butterflies)
Don't know what you do, but I feel butterflies

I wish we was more than friends
And I know the reason why
Because I

I feel butterflies floating around inside (oh, I feel them inside)
Whenever I'm with you, I feel butterflies (with, yeah)
I feel butterflies (I feel) floating around inside (butterflies)
Don't know what you do but I feel butterflies (woo)

I feel, I feel butterflies, butterflies, oh
I feel, I feel butterflies, butterflies
Butterflies, butterflies, oh
Lalalalalalala
