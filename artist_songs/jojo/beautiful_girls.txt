You thought that I was fly
Right then you wished that I would be your baby (be your baby)
You try to spit some game
Asking me girl what's your name
All that ice upon ya chain
So I asked you the same
Something tells me that we have fun together (fun together)

Tonight is yours

You've been calling me
Leaving messages all week
Was your curiosity
Got ya knees weak
I'm not looking for a man
So I don't want no confusion (no confusion)
I took ya to the floor
Got ya begging me for more
But that was my queue to go
So I hit the door
I let you hot
With your mind used to running wild (running wild)

I ain't easy to find
I'm one of a kind
Oh when I dutty wine
I know your only mine
If you stick around
Be careful not to fall in love (fall in love)

I'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When I say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls

When I say it's over

Now a couple months have passed
Never thought that this would last
Oh everybody asked
How ya got a girl like that
But you should've known
That nothing lasts forever (lasts forever)
I mashed up ya mind
When I tell you lies
But boy don't be surprised
That I'm seeing other guys
I'm too young to settle
And you should've known better (known better)

Damn all these beautiful girls (you should have known)
We're only gonna do your dirt (cos I'll have)
I'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When I say it's over
