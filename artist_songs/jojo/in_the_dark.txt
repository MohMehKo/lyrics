This ain't the first or last time 
We'll meet up this late at night 
To let our fates intertwine 
Casually I'd rather be 
Detached from all tragedy 
This don't need to be defined 

And I know that it's wrong 
I do, I do 
Baby keep holding on 
I do, I do 
Yeah, I know that it's wrong 
I do 
When the sun comes up I'll be gone 

[Chorus:] 
I only know him in the dark 
I only know him in the dark 

Try to stay desensitized 
Keep my feelings out of mind 
My body won't be denied 
Never took this road before 
Love was always out the court 
Of anyone I've been with before 

And I know that it's wrong 
I do, I do 
Baby keep holding on 
I do 
Yeah, I know that it's wrong 
I do 
When the sun comes up I'll be gone 

[Chorus:] 
I only know him in the dark 
I only know him in the dark 

A smile's across your face 
Your lips a familiar taste 
Stay focused, I try 
Can't get this out of my mind 
I want more than what this is 
Whatever we're calling this 
The truth just breaks my heart 

[Chorus:] 
I only know him in the dark 
I only know him in the dark
