Baby, seems like everywhere I go 
I see you, from your eyes and smile
It's like I breathe you, helplessly I reminisce
Don't want to compare nobody to you
Boy, I try to catch myself but I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing I can not let it go

Know that I can't get over you
Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's deja vu
Know that I can't get over you
Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's deja vu

Seeing things that I know can't be
Am I dreaming, when I saw you walking past me
Almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losing it
Boy, I try to catch myself but I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing I can not let it go

Know that I can't get over you
Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's deja vu
Know that I can't get over you
Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's deja vu

And baby I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Feel like your everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having deja vu
Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next train, I don't care
Is it because I'm missing you
That I'm having deja vu
Boy, I try to catch myself but I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing I can not let it go

Know that I can't get over you
Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's deja vu
Know that I can't get over you
Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's deja vu
