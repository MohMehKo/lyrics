[Originally performed by Drake]

Hey there pretty girl 
You don't look like yourself anymore 
But I know you couldn't stop it 
Everyone's watching 

Laid out on the bathroom floor 
With your clothes on the door 
You been hurt so many times before 
Girl you gotta leaveeeeeee 

She woke up in 
Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlanta 
She just stuck in 
Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlanta 

And she dance to the song 
And she dance to the song 
And it goes hey now now 
Watch her go down ohhhh 

She wears the world on her shoulders 
Noone else could really understand 
She says shes better explaining, intoxicated 

But thats when the all chips fall down 
And theres nobody around 
To catch her when she hits the ground 
Its happening againnnnnnnnnn 

She woke up in 
Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlanta 
She just stuck in 
Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlanta 

And she dance to the song 
And she dance to the song 
And it goes hey now now 
Watch her go down ohhhh 

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know...
