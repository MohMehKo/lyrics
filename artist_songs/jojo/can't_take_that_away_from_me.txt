I need a knife to cut the tension
I need a slice of your affection
You might be thinking the grass is greener
Contemplating a change of scenery
Even hand in hand I can feel your distance
If you walk away, baby boy you'll be missing me
You better think about no one

You can't just let it go so easily
Try and find a girl who compares to me
When you know everything that you mean to me
You can't take that away from me

Inseparable we were before, remember?
Can't just let a moment ruin us forever
We're not at the point of no return
I'm not ready to watch us crash and burn
I know in your heart that
You're tired of the distance
Not gonna let you make a mistake and be missing me
You better think about no one

You can't just let it go so easily
Try and find a girl who compares to me
When you know everything that you mean to me
You can't take that away from me

Imagination gets the best of me
I can't see another girl with what belongs to me
I had a feeling you would get a little stingy
Cause if you go you'll be taking a part of me
You better think about no one

You can't just let it go so easily
Try and find a girl who compares to me
When you know everything that you mean to me
You can't take that away from me

You can't just let it go so easily
Try and find a girl who compares to me
When you know everything that you mean to me
You can't take that away from me
