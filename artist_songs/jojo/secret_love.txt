Boy you’re so hard to believe 
Boy you’re so hard to believe 

[Verse 1:]
Just a friend 
That’s all I’ve ever been to you 
Oh just a girl 
Who wants to be the center of your world 
But I ain’t got much to offer 
But my heart and soul 
And I guess that’s not enough 
For you to notice me 
I’m just a girl 
And I guess that’s all I’ll ever be to you 
To you 

[Chorus:]
I try to smile when I see other girls with you 
Acting like everything is ok 
But ohh 
You don’t know how it feels to be so in love 
With someone who doesn’t even know 
My secret love 

[Verse 2:]
In my dreams 
I see us both together constantly 
Why can’t you see 
This love that’s here for you inside of me 
Ohhh 
What do I have to do 
For you to notice this 
You look at her with love 
With me it’s just friendship 
I’m just your girl 
And I guess that’s all I’ll ever be to you 
To you 

[Chorus:]
I try to smile when I see other girls with you 
Acting like everything is ok 
But ohh 
you don’t know how it feels to be so in love 
With someone who doesn’t even know 
My secret love 

[Bridge:]
What do you see in her 
You don’t see in me (don’t see in me) 
Boy you’re so hard to believe 
Why do you show her love 
But there’s none for me 
Boy you don’t make sense to me 
Cause I don’t have much to offer 
But my heart and soul 
And I guess that’s not enough 
For you to notice me 
I’m just your girl 
And I guess that’s all I’ll ever be to you 
To you 

[Chorus:]
I try to smile when I see other girls with you 
Acting like everything is ok (everything ain’t ok) 
But ohh 
you don’t know how it feels to be so in love (so in love with you baby) 
With someone who doesn’t even know 
My secret love 

Boy you’re so hard to believe
