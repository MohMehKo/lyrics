(Not Too Loud)

I'ma PYT with an attitude
Sometimes I rebound from what I'm supposed to do
But when your love conquered my heart
I know I had to have you, all of the time

See I've been gone for a while now, there's nothing I can't take
The Miles keep us away (my bell)
without you I'm running out of energy
I want you here with me
And baby without you I'm stalling on this road alone
When I'm gone too long I'm running on Empty without you
I'm going without cause I'm running on E
And yes I know this effect baby I'm running on empty without u

Choose the game I'm telling you
Boy in your eyes I saw the truth
Cause It was just so right
And now that I got you, I know what was missing in my life

See I've been gone for a while now, there's nothing I can't take

The miles keep us away (my bell)
without you I'm running out of energy
I want you here with me
And baby without you I'm stalling on this road alone
When I'm gone too long I'm running on Empty without you
I'm going without cause I'm running on E
And yes I know this effect baby I'm running on empty without you

It's uncontrollable, I get emotional what more can I say
like a coffee with cream you compliment me
And I never want to be too far away

without you I'm running out of energy
I want you here with me
And baby without you I'm stalling on this road alone
When I'm gone too long I'm running on empty without you
I'm going without cause I'm running on e
And yes I know this effect baby I'm running on empty without you
