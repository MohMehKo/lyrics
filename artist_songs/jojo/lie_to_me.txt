Acting like you don't want this love
Cause lately I don't see you around
Feeling suspicious, oh
It's like somebody else is laying you down, down, down

Don't wanna live without you baby
I try to play the fool and ignore intuition
Lot of girls would just walk away,
But I'ma stay until I play my position

Even if you're giving all my love away-away-away, Lie to me
Cuz you know that I'm in love with you baby-bay-bay, Lie to me
I know living without you would only drive me crazy, Lie to me 
Lie to me, lie to me

It's my decision, oh
In competition with the chicks on the side
I'm on a mission, yeah
It's sick but I believe in love will reprise

Don't wanna live without you baby
I try to play the fool and ignore intuition
Lot of girls would just walk away,
But I'ma stay until I play my position

Even if you give it all my love away, lie to me
Cause you know that I'm in love with you, lie to me
I know living with you.. lie to me
Lie to me, lie to me, lie to me

Now I know what it means when they say
Ignorance is bliss
But I'ma make it impossible
For any girl to keep with my tricks
Even do your thing I know, just keep it on the low
If you feeling guilty baby, just keep lying to me
And I'ma do the same, and I had to play the game
No I won't ever complain
Just keep lying to me
Lie to me, lie to me, lie to me, lie to me, lie to me
Lie to me, lie to me, lie to me, lie to me

Even if you're giving all my love away-away-away, Lie to me
Cuz you know that I'm in love with you baby-bay-bay, Lie to me
I know living without you would only drive me crazy, Lie to me
Lie to me, lie to me
Even if you're giving all my love away-away-away, Lie to me
Cuz you know that I'm in love with you baby-bay-bay, Lie to me
I know living without you would only drive me crazy, Lie to me
Lie to me, lie to me
