I seen a lot of good liars in my day but I never seen nothin like this, no 
I met a lot of real players in my life, congratulations you made it on the list 
You broke down the castle I built up around me 
Hidin from the world but still somehow you found me 
Now I see what it is 
You're an illusionist 
Can't believe that I fell for it 

I never thought you would be so ungrateful 
You fooled me into believing 
You're like the greatest magician that I've ever seen 
Had me lookin the other way 
Well now I'm blinded by everything 
You don't even know what to say 
Well 

I'mma tell the whole world how you did it 
The world how you did it, whole world how you did it 
I'm onto you 
Tell the whole world how you did it 
The world how you did it, whole world how you did it 
I'm onto you 

Should've been followin my first instinct I would've stayed so far away from you 
But you decieved me, had me believin that every lie you told was the truth 
I didn't see then, it was all smoke and mirrors 
Boy you had me fooled, I was in the crowd cheerin' 
Now I see what it is 
You're an illusionist 
Can't believe that I fell for it 

I never thought you would be so ungrateful 
You fooled me into believing 
You're like the greatest magician that I've ever seen 
Had me lookin the other way 
Well now I'm blinded by everything 
You don't even know what to say 
Well 

I'mma tell the whole world how you did it 
The world how you did it, whole world how you did it 
I'm onto you 
Tell the whole world how you did it 
The world how you did it, whole world how you did it 
I'm onto you 

Now that the cat's out the bag 
You can stop with the act 
I don't buy into that, no 
I've seen this show before 
And I know how it is 
There's no need to pretend 
He might have had everyone else 
But you're not gettin me 
I'm not that naive, no 
Now I'm in the clear 
I don't need to be here 
So I redisappear 

I never thought you would be so ungrateful 
You fooled me into believing 
You're like the greatest magician that I've ever seen 
Had me lookin the other way 
Well now I'm blinded by everything 
You don't even know what to say 
Well 
You're like the greatest magician that I've ever seen 
Had me lookin the other way 
Well now I'm blinded by everything 
You don't even know what to say 
Well 

I'mma tell the whole world how you did it 
The world how you did it, whole world how you did it 
I'm onto you 
Tell the whole world how you did it
