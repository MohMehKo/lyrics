Baby..
Oh oh oh oh whoa
Oh oh oh oh whoa
My love
Oh I'm missing you baby
All day..

There was a boy who lived in a small town
He met a girl in the big city
He fell in love the second he saw her
Took her awhile but then she came around
They were so happy
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
But she had to keep the show on the road
So she dropped the bomb that broke his soul
And it went into pieces, she didn't mean it
Chasing a dream and leave love in the rain
I feel the pain cos she's me

Oh can't you see
You tried hanging in, waiting, lost patience
And now you forget about me
Just admit it yeah
Got my heart racing, I'm pacing
Can't face that it's time to let you free baby

Boy I wish it was as easy
Making paper airplanes (oh oh paper airplanes)
So it wouldn't take so long to get back to your arms
Paper airplanes
I just wish it were as easy
As making paper airplanes (oh oh paper airplanes)
But I know it's too far to get back to where you are
In a paper airplane

Couples around me, I see it in movies
Want what they got yeah I'm so jealous
Take it for granted, the times that they had just smothered against
'cause I'd do anything to close the distance

Can't you see that
You tried hanging in, waiting, lost patience
And now you forget about me
Just admit it yeah
It's got my heart racing, I'm pacing
Can't face that it's time to let you free baby

Boy I wish it was as easy
As making paper airplanes (oh oh paper airplanes)
So it wouldn't take so long to get back to your arms
Paper airplanes
I just wish it were as easy
As making paper airplanes (oh oh paper airplanes)
But I know it's too far to get back to where you are
In a paper airplane
Oh oh oh yeah

I see the light move to the next (?) smokin' train
'cause I need to get to you faster then yesterday
'cause my eye's on fire
Knowing I'm lose the best thing that has walked into my life

I just wish it were as easy
As making paper airplanes
So it wouldn't take so long to get back to your arms
I'll take a paper airplane

Boy I wish it was as easy
As making paper airplanes (oh oh paper airplanes)
So it wouldn't take so long to get in your arms
Making paper airplanes
I just wish it were as easy
Making paper airplanes (oh oh paper airplanes)
But I know it's too far to get back to where you are
In a paper airplane
