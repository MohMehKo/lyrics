Look at what you do to me
Why you keep doing it?
It's getting me gone

Boy the way you do me
Boy the way you do me
Why you gotta be so good when you give it to me?

I've been trying to think of ways to tell you no
Same time I've been thinking I'd be crazy to let it go

Boy the way you do me
Boy the way you do me
You be talking something good when you talking to me

I been trying to think of ways to tell you no
Same time I'm thinking I'd be crazy to let you go

Most just can run up on me
I meet them at the door
Me getting swept off my feet
That don't happen no

Since you been coming around
I been scrambling
Steady switching up so much
My girls that know me
Got to let up

When we met up
you done got me in love
couldn't say it
but the way it happened
just let me know
the records I was spinning
kept me missing out

We ain't even traded kisses
But I'm feeling so much fire in here

Boy the way you do me
Boy the way you do me
Why you gotta be so good when you give it to me?

Boy the way you do me
Boy the way you do me
Why you gotta be so good when you give it to me?

I been trying to think of ways to tell you no
But at the same time I'm thinking I'd be crazy to let you go

Boy the way you do me
Boy the way you do me
You be talking something good when you talking to me

I been trying to think of ways to tell you no
but at the same time I'm thinking I'd be crazy to let you go

Boy the way you do me
Boy the way you do me
Why you gotta be so good when you give it to me

Uh oh Uh oh Uh Oh uh oh
What would you do?
[Repeat]

Boy the way you do me
Boy the way you do me
Why gotta be so good when you give it to me

boy the way you do me
boy the way you do me
why you gotta be so good when you give it to me

I been trying to think of ways to tell you no
same time I'm thinking I'd be crazy to let you go

Boy the way you do me
Boy the way you do me
you been talking something good when you talking to me

I been trying to think of ways to tell you know
same time I been thinking I'd be crazy to let you go

Boy the way you do me
Boy the way you do me
why gotta be so good when you give it to me

Funny thing
I didn't wanna believe
Of a love that was free
If for a moment I could
So many disappointments
Had me feeling something like
I didn't have a reason I should
