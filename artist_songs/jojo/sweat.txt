Whoo!
Ooh whee baby
Got my breathing
You gon' make me (fall out)
Up in here this evening
Oh whoa

[Chorus:]
You got that something that I wanna know
I'm heating up I'm bout to lose control
It feels so good I think I'll let it go
Say somethin to me before I close the door
Now hold up baby, got me open
Ain't the one to roll up
Not one for approaching, but uh I'm feelin something I ain't never felt
It's gettin harder to control myself
I wouldn't do this for nobody else
But this is somethin I can't help

[Speaking:]
I don't normally do this but do this but -
Boy you make me sweat

(Yeah yeah) please excuse the tone
(Yeah yeah) but tell me what cologne
(Yeah yeah) it is that you got on
Cause it's makin me wanna bite ya

[Chorus:]
You got that something that I wanna know
I'm heating up I'm bout to lose control (lose it)
It feels so good I think I'll let it go (let it go!)
Say somethin to me before I close the door
Now hold up baby, got me open
Ain't the one to roll up
Not one for approaching, but uh I'm feelin something I ain't never felt
It's gettin harder to control myself
I wouldn't do this for nobody else
But this is somethin I can't help

I don't normally do this but
Boy you make me sweat
Yeah there's just somethin about you
Boy you make me sweat
Yeah yeah yeah
Whoo
