3:30 in the morning time
Watching my lover sleep
With my heart wide open

All this racing in my mind
Goes to lover’s lingering
And my eyes wide open

Been around the world,
But the roads lead back to you
If it’s zero gravity I feel pulled right back to you

Nothing's impossible,
With love so astronomical
So trust when you watch me go
I’ll orbit back to you
Cause I've been to different atmospheres
Never did I breathe so clear
Know there’s billions in the world
But I’ll always come back to you 
Yeah, you, you, you, you

All the seasons I've survived,
Going up and down this dream
With my eyes wide open

I've seen love heal the broken
It’s made me proud to sing
With my life wide open

Nothing's impossible,
With love so astronomical
So trust when you watch me go
I’ll orbit back to you
Cause I've been to different atmospheres
Never did I breathe so clear
Know there’s billions in the world
But I’ll always come back to you 
Yeah, I know there’s billions in the world
But I’ll always come back to you babe

Know there’s billions in the world
But I’ll always come back to you babe

I've heard too many “yes's" just to die about a no... Fuck!
And I've seen to many "yes's" just to hmm...
Today I have too many tattoos to go back to status-quo
And I've heard too many “yes's" just to die about a “no”

I've seen too many smiles to be flustered by a frown
And I’m so used to being so high up you can’t just talk me down
I hot-boxed my apartment just to come up with this song
But writers block kept winning and I let it tag along
Whatever

Cause I've been to different atmospheres
Know there’s billions in the world
But I’ll always come back to you
