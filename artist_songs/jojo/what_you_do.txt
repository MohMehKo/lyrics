Hey, hey, Say it with your actions (actions)
Saying those words to me
Doesn't mean anything
Hey, hey, I don't wanna hear 'em (hear 'em)
Baby you can keep those three
Might as well not even speak

Many different times before
You were almost out the door
Than you'd say it and I'd forgive everything
Whoa oh, cause I'm sorry to report
That's not working anymore
Now I need to see if that's really what you mean

No more I'm sorry
I love you 
I need proof
Baby boy
It's all in
What you do
No more I love you
Baby if that's true
Baby boy
It's all in
What you do

Say it with your actions
Say it in the way you touch
Things that you do for us
Said I don't wanna be mean
But when it comes to this love
Saying it just ain't enough

Well, many different times before
You were almost out the door
Than you'd say it and I'd forgive everything
Babe I'm sorry to report
That it ain't gon' work, not anymore
Now I need to see if that's really what you mean

No more I'm sorry
I love you 
I need proof
Baby boy
It's all in
What you do
No more I love you
Baby if that's true
Baby boy
It's all in
What you do

It's, it's in what you do
It's, it's in what you do
It's in what you
It's all in what you do

It's in what you
It's, it's in what you do
It's in what you
It's all in what you do

No more I'm sorry
I love you 
I need proof
Baby boy
It's all in
What you do
No more I love you
Baby if that's true
Baby boy
It's all in
What you do

It's in what you
It's, it's in what you do
It's in what you
It's all in what you do
