[VERSE 1:]
My homie since knee high
We came up on the south side
Where you had to beat the street lights home
We got into some street fights
But the next day we be right back get it all
Wherever there was me, there was you
And we were like crew
Straight to junior high school
Then you messed it all up
Started pushing up
Kissed me on the cheek
And I fell in love

Shorty's a little taller now
Into big things, he's a baller now
His heart never changed
I can see he's still down
I can't forget him (No no no no)
More than his voice is changing now
All that I see is rearranging now (Now)
It just ain't the same
Catching feelings now
I should tell him (Yea)

[CHORUS:]
Ooooh when the the boy next door (Next door)
Don't want to be my homeboy no more
Saw something that he never saw before
I think he wants to be my baby, baby
Been thinking 'bout him all my life (My life)
Now I see him in a whole new light
Something about it feels so right (That's why)
I think he wants to be my baby, baby

[VERSE 2:]
Every night when we get home
Undercovers talking on the phone
Here comes my mother
It's way too late
Might get in trouble
My heart can't wait (So much to say)
Writing till my hand cramps up
4 pages saying I'm in love (I got a crush)
Can't get you off my mind (Can you pick me up baby)
I'm sure I'll be fine when I look into your eyes

Shorty's a little taller now
Into big things, he's a baller now
His heart never changed
I can see he's still down
I can't forget him
More than his voice is changing now
All that I see is rearranging now
It just ain't the same
Catching feelings now
I should tell him (Gotta tell him that I love him)

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE:]
Chocolate covered candy kisses
They keep me reminiscing
All I want is what your giving
Nothing like your affection
So in love and you're the reason
There's no more lonely season
Lately boy, you drive me crazy
Think I wanna be your baby
[Repeat]

Oh-we-oh
Oh oh oh (Don't wanna be my homeboy no more)
Oh-we-oh-we-oh-we-oh
Oh oh oh
Oh-we-oh-we-oh-we-oh
Oh oh oh
Oh-we-oh-we-oh-we-oh (Why why why why why)
Now homeboy wants to be my baby, be my baby, be my baby
Oh-we-oh
Oh oh oh (He don't wanna be my homeboy no more)
Oh-we-oh-we-oh-we-oh
Oh oh oh
Oh-we-oh-we-oh-we-oh (No more)
Oh oh oh
Oh-we-oh-we-oh-we-oh (Said he)
Now homeboy wants to be my baby, be my baby, be my baby
(Wants to be my baby now, now, now now now)
