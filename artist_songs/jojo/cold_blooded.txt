Yeah, yeah, oh, whoa
Sorry, sorry, love
Sorry, sorry, love
Sorry, sorry, love, love, love, love

Wait, I know we hit it off on a good note
But now you're gettin' a little too comfortable
Now let me put you on the game
(I give love a bad name)
Wait, before you go and pull off the handcuffs
I'm not your prisoner, don't try to lock me up
That'll be your worst mistake
(The biggest you'll ever make)

Sometimes what you want, it ain't what you get
I say I want love, and I take it back
I guess I just don't know how to act
I'm so-o-o-rry
Sometimes what you give, it ain't what you get
'Cause I gave my heart and I ain't seen it back
Now revenge is running through my veins, yeah

Better unlock the chains
Or else, baby, I'm a break away
I'm sorry but I can't change it,
I was born this way
I was born this way
Caught me cold blooded
Put the blame on me
Charge me to the first degree
Sorry but a love gene's missing in my DNA
Caught me cold blooded
Yeah, ye-yeah, yeah, yeah caught me cold blooded

Stop, you're gonna make me put up a roadblock
Taking the life of me down to the last drop
You gotta give me room to breathe
Or I will become the enemy
Boy your girl's gotta do what you gotta do
So if you let me keep it moving we'll keep it cool
Don't try to change me babe
That'll push me away

Sometimes what you want, it ain't what you get
I say I want love, and I take it back
I guess I just don't know how to act
I'm so-o-o-rry
Sometimes what you give, it ain't what you get
'Cause I gave my heart and I ain't seen it back
Now revenge is running through my veins

Better unlock the chains
Or else, baby, I'm a break away
I'm sorry but I can't change it
I was born this way
Caught me cold blooded
Put the blame on me
Charge me to the first degree
Sorry but a love gene's missing in my DNA
Caught me cold blooded
Yeah, ye-yeah, yeah, yeah caught me cold blooded
Yeah, ye-yeah, yeah, yeah caught me cold blooded

Hear me out
Know you think I'm a monster
But my heart's been locked up
Wanna keep me here;
You gotta let me come up for air, yeah
Let me come up for air
Can't be what you want me to be
'Cause my love's just cold blooded

Better unlock the chains
Or else, baby, I'm a break away
I'm sorry but I can't (yeah) change it,
I was born this way
Caught me cold blooded
Put the blame on me (ohhhhhhhhhh)
Charge me to the first degree
Sorry but a love gene's missing in my DNA
Caught me cold blooded
Yeah, ye-yeah, yeah, yeah caught me cold blooded [echo]
