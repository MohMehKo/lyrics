Got to fly away 
Got to fly away 

Since I was a little girl I knew what I wanted 
One day I would see the world and make my mark on it 
Put in time, sacrificed never thought of thinking twice 
Since I was a little girl I dreamed it 
Now I'm standing with you in this terminal 
With a ticket so far from your love 

Can I have one more kiss, one more touch 
I just can't get enough of you of you 
But I'm in a rush I got to fly away 
Planes waiting up for me right at gate twenty-three 
There's a doorway to my dreams 
I could go or I could stay 
Should I change my life or miss my flight? 

My alarm clock in the morning said you got to go now 
The breakfast you were calling and my heart just broke down 
Cause tomorrow we will be waking up separately 
Wish I never heard that clock ring 
See I don't want to win if my hearts got to lose 
(Don't want to win, don't want to lose) 
So how in the world do I choose? 

I just need one more kiss, one more touch 
I just can't get enough of you 
But I'm in a rush I got to fly away (fly away) 
Planes waiting up for me right at gate twenty-three 
There's a doorway to my dreams 
I could go or I could stay 
Should I change my life or miss my flight? 
(Change my life or miss my flight?) 

How can you measure the promise of love 
When it's weighing against a chance that comes once 
How can I leave when I know he's the one 
When the dust settles he might not be here 
And I'm standing with you in this terminal 
Crying my eyes out in tears 

I just need one more kiss, one more touch 
I just can't get enough of you 
But I'm in a rush I got to fly away (fly away) 
Planes waiting up for me right at gate twenty-three 
(Planes waiting up for me at gate twenty-three) 
There's a doorway to my dreams 
I could go or I could stay 
Should I change my life or miss my flight? 
(Should I change my life or miss my flight?) 
Should I change my life or miss my flight? 
What do I do? (change my life or miss my flight?) 
Fly away, MmmMmm 
Got to fly away 
I got to fly away
