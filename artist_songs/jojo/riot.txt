I've got a proposition honey
Right here waiting for you
You-You don't need to spend the money
I know what we can do
Now-now-now go and call your friends
And I'll hit up my girls
Got a feeling, that together
We can conquer the world
Cause you sexy and I like it
You got me all excited
Don't wanna de-deny it
Change to purple and gold

Ah, alright, I wanna start a riot tonight
Don't matter what they think is right
Then I think it's time that we forget about it
I wanna start a riot tonight

You remind me of a rockstar breaking the rules
I see the lights of a cop car behind you
Sa-sa-sa-speeding down sunset, picture there
I-I-I-If you wanna riot 
You know just where it's at
Because you crazy and I like it
You got me all excited
I wanna paint the night
Shades of purple and gold

Alright, I wanna start a riot tonight
Don't matter what they think is right
Then I think it's time that we forget about it
I wanna start a riot tonight

Baby I can handle whatever you let go
Don't be afraid to get wild tonight
Tell you baby I can throw
Whatever punches you throw
Not afraid to start a riot tonight

Alright, I wanna start a riot tonight
Don't matter what they think is right
Then I think it's time that we forget about it
I wanna start a riot tonight

Alright, I wanna start a riot tonight
Don't matter what they think is right
Then I think it's time that we forget about it
I wanna start a riot tonight

Wanna start a riot tonight
Wanna start a riot tonight
Wanna start a riot tonight
Wanna start a riot tonight
