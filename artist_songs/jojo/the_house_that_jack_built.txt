This is the house that Jack built y'all
Remember this house

This was the land that he worked by hand
This is the dream of an upright man
There was a room that was filled with love
It was a love that I was proud of
There was a life that I had planned
With my love, my same old love
In the house that Jack built
Remember this house

There was a fence that held our love
There was a gate that walked out of
There was a heart that was turned to stone
This is the house that just ain't no home
There was a love that I destroyed
With my love, my same old love
In the house that Jack built
Remember this house

Oh, what is the use of crying?
Because I brought it on myself
There ain't no relying
And it seems awful funny
That I didn't understand
Until I lost my upright man

Up on the hill everything stands still
In the house that Jack built
Remember this house

I got the house
I got the car
I got the rug
And I got the rack
But I ain't got Jack
And I want my Jack back

I turned my back on Jack
He said he wasn't coming back
I turned my back on Jack
He said he wasn't coming back
Well come on back, come on back
To the same one you built
Yeah, it's the same one you built
Better come on back Jack
Oh, come back Jack
Baby, you can't understand
Until you lose your upright man
You better come on back Jack
Better come on back Jack
Oh, come back Jack
