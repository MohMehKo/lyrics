Boy this feeling is so amazing
For your love boy I've been craving
Boy I need you closer to me
So I can feel what I've been missing (oh)

Touch me.. kiss me.. hold me.. caress me
I need all your love 
Want admit it I got to have it
Gimme all or nothing 

And its true what you do I cant deny it
And you see that I'm not tryin to hide it
And its true what you do I cant deny it
And you see that I'm not tryin to hide it

Yeah yeah

Tell me does it feel to you?
When you feel the way your girl should
Boy you really got me crazy
Baby I can never get enough

And its true what you do I cant deny it
And you see that I'm not tryin' to hide it

And I try to tell myself to take my time
When I feel you close to me I lose my mind
I'm hooked on you

Touch me.. kiss me.. hold me.. caress me
Want admit it I got to have it
Touch me.. kiss me.. hold me.. caress me
Want admit it I got to have it
