Mmmm, Ohhh

I heard you were out last night
That's okay with me, that's fine
I ain't like those girlfriends
I don't got a leash on my man

Flirting just for fun is cool
But only if that's all you do
So what's this in your pocket
With some chicks name on it
The look on your face
Says you called her already
Well if you really needed numbers, baby

One number times that I play the fool
And two are the boxes I packed for you
We're over if you want some numbers
Here's a number three, six, nine
Ain't your address no more
Your cab will be here at four
It's over if you want some numbers
Here's a number

Stay ten feet away from me
Not one word don't beg or plead (no, no)
I heard enough talking
Just turn around and keep walking
I went the address book
On your phone I had to look
And I saw some new names
I bet one on there yesterday
The look on your face
Let's me know you're guilty
So here's some numbers
If you want them, baby

One number times that I play the fool
And two are the boxes I packed for you
We're over if you want some numbers
Here's a number three, six, nine
Ain't your address no more
Your cab will be here at four
It's over if you want some numbers
Here's a number
Uh-oh, Uh-oh
Say it again
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh

Zero are the feelings I got left for you
The 411 is that you and I are through
Cause you can't deny, you told a million lies
It's three fifty-nine, oh look here comes your ride

One number times that I play the fool
And two are the boxes I packed for you
We're over if you want some numbers
Here's a number three, six, nine
Ain't your address no more
Your cab will be here at four
It's over if you want some numbers
Here's a number
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Never again, no
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Here's a number
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh
