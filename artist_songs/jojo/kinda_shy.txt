Whoo
Ooh whoa yeah
Almost like I'm lost inside a dream
Hazy and ain't nothin what it seems
When I see you start to walk away
You know I lose control, can't concentrate
Feels like somethings happening inside
Wanna know you, wish I could say "Hi"
But I lose all words when you approach
Nothing to say, say when you are close

You make me feel it when I see you
I can not deny
There's somethin bout you, somethin special
You just make me high

You can say I'm shy long as you don't say I'm stuck up
Cause I get real close to you and then be scared to say what's up
You can call me scary just don't say I'm arrogant
Baby I'm just kinda shy will you just ask me before that
Hey

Now baby don't you think I'm bein rude
When I look away don't get confused
Cause I be thinkin, what else can I do?
Can my emotions make me lose?
But I won't let you get away this time
Now I know you're, you're my type of guy
Baby I'm so all into your style
And I ain't mad cause I'm a make you mine

[Chorus:]
You make me feel it when I see you
I can not deny
There's somethin bout you, somethin special
You just make me high

You can say I'm shy long as you don't say I'm stuck up
Cause I get real close to you and then be scared to say what's up
You can call me scary just don't say I'm arrogant
Baby I'm just kinda shy will you just ask me before that
Hey

Ever since I can remember I've always been this way
But not so bad til the thought of you came into play
And I know what you're thinking, you think that I'm playin
Maybe wasting time
There's really nothing wrong with me I wanna be by your side

[Chorus:]
You make me feel it when I see you
I can not deny
There's somethin bout you, somethin special
You just make me high
You can say I'm shy long as you don't say I'm stuck up
Cause I get real close to you (get real close to you)
And then be scared to say what's up (scared to say what's up)
You can call me scary just don't say I'm arrogant (arrogant oh)
Baby I'm just kinda shy will you just ask me before that

You can say I'm shy long as you don't say I'm stuck up
Cause I get real close to you and then be scared to say what's up
You can call me scary just don't say I'm arrogant
Baby I'm just kinda shy will you just ask me before that
Hey
Oh baby
You gotta excuse me
I'm shy
