I'm attracted to his glitz and his glamour, I'm attracted to the lights in his eyes
And once you get a taste of his poison, you'll get all wrapped up in his lies
You don't have to give in and fall for nothing
Even if you were to feel that you were through
You're an angel that's casted out from heaven
It's sad but true and makes me wonder why

It's over, said and done
Looks like they found themselves a new one
And just like that a star is born
It makes me wonder

Hollywood, Hollywood, do you have a heart at all?
And is it real? Just let me know
Hollywood, Hollywood, do you give a shit at all?
And do you feel what people feel?
'Cause there's a one in a million chance you'll make it big someday
Don't sell your soul to have what someone had yesterday
Hollywood
Oh, Hollywood

Mother always told me, "Jo, be careful, everything that glitters ain't gold"
"Don't fall in love with a promising man because he'll just use you and leave you for broke"
So you signed your name on the line, don't read the fine print
Thinking you'll blow up over night, night
Gave the world, but your wings, you lost them
Drowning in the tears that you cry and that's why

It's over, said and done
Looks like they found themselves a new one
And just like that a star is born
It makes me wonder

Hollywood, Hollywood, do you have a heart at all?
And is it real? Just let me know
Hollywood, Hollywood, do you give a shit at all?
And do you feel what people feel?
'Cause there's a one in a million chance you'll make it big someday
Don't sell your soul to have what someone had yesterday
Hollywood
Oh, Hollywood

We're living in a place of tinsel and wear
Everything is fake, faded and worn
Relying on your looks can only take you so far
But even then you got girls chasing dollar bills
And left looking for a thrill
It's not real 'cause in time it will all disappear

Hollywood, Hollywood, do you have a heart at all?
And is it real? Just let me know
Hollywood, Hollywood, do you give a shit at all?
And do you feel what people feel?
'Cause there's a one in a million chance you'll make it big someday
Don't sell your soul to have what someone had yesterday
Hollywood
Oh, Hollywood

Not alone
Not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
Oh, I'm all alone
