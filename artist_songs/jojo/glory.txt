Oh glory,
Oooh glory
There is room enough in paradise
To have a home in

Jesus my all, to Heaven’s gone
To have home in glory
He whom I fix my hopes upon
To have a home in glory
Glory-yyy uuuuh

There is room enough in paradise
To have a home in glory
His light I see
And I’ll pursue to have a home in glory, oh
Uuuuu, glory-yyy
Glory-yyy there is room enough in paradise
To have a home
To have a home
To have a home
In glory-yyy
