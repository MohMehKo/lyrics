I can't believe I'm all Alone 
Especially cause it's friday night, I had things to do but I brushed them off to Be with you 
All dress up with no where to go 
I've been watching time go by, the minutes (lie) 
But I still haven't heard from you 
How busy can you be, Clearly too busy for me 
you know I like you so much 
but your pissing me off (Really pissing me off) 
I need consistancy, You know you don't deserve me 
Say You like me so much 
But your pissing me off (Really pissing me off) 

Look at what you did cause you just lost one 
Now (we made) that deep damage is done 
You were lucky to just have my number at all 
So tell me baby, tell me Why didn't you call 
It's gonna take more than a coke and a smile 
To make me forget that you didn't dial 
You were lucky to just have my number at all 
Break it down for me, Why didn't you call 

I'm feeling so delusional 
Cause I thought that you and I were vibin 
Maybe that was in my mind 
This sh!t is bad for my ego 
Guessin you would rather spend your time 
Laid up in my arms tonight 

How busy can you be 
What are you doing if it's not me 
I know I like you so much and it's pissing me off (Really pissing me off) 
But baby honestly, It's clear you don't deserve me 

Say You like me so much 
But your pissing me off (Really pissing me off)

Thought that we Had Chemistry 
Now I'm second guessing things 
It's crazy how one thing can change the game 
(how to change, how to change, how to change the game) 
I'm not trying to waste my time Waiting up for you 
(Will not) throw you out my pocket like some loose change
