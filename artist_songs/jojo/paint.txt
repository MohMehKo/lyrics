Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Since you shipped my ass off to sea

Saturday home depot
Said your living room needs a fresh coat
Pick your color blue or white
Whatever it is, gotta set the mood right
Got my hardware let's put in work
Old hat, old jeans, no t-shirt
Before I know it it's all on the floor

'Cause I just wanna do you in the paint
I wanna make love to you in the place
I-I rolling around in the mess that we made
Brushing and stroking the best sex we made
And now I'm putting in your hair
And you're rubbing it on everywhere
I just wanna do you in the paint uh oh
Girl don't be shy I know you ain't
'Cause I just wanna

[Jojo:]
Saturday I wanna know
Why the fuck you still wearing all of them clothes
Living room, purple walls
Gotta something for you underneath my overalls
About to give you a rush
Show you baby I know how to work a paint brush
You're my canvas so I'ma sign my name

'Cause I just wanna do you in the paint
I wanna make love to you in the place
I-I rolling around in the mess that we made
Brushing and stroking the best sex we made
And now I'm putting in your hair
And you're rubbing it on everywhere
I just wanna do you in the paint uh oh
Boy don't be shy I know you ain't
'Cause I just wanna

So don't try and fuck me about
I just wanted to paint your house
(Shut up)

'Cause I just wanna do you in the paint
I wanna make love to you in the place
I I rolling around in the mess that we made
Brushing and stroking the best sex we made
