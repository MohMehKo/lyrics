When we met, always knew
I would feel that magic for you
On my mind, constantly
In my arms is where you should be (Mmmmm)
(It's the Remix)

I love you here by me, baby
You let my love fly free
I want you in my life for all time
Caught up in the rapture of love
Nothing else can compare
When I feel the magic of you

We stay side by side
Til the storms of life pass us by
Like my life, warm my heart
Say tonight will be just the start (Oooooo)

I love you here by me, baby
You let my love fly free
I want you to be with me for all time
Caught up in the rapture of love
Nothing else can compare
When I feel the magic of you
Feeling's always new
When I'm caught up in the rapture of you

I love you here by me, baby
You let my love fly free
I want you to be with me for all time
Caught up in the rapture of love
Nothing else can compare
When I feel the magic of you
Feeling's always new
When I'm caught up in the rapture of you

Cause I don't remember (don't remember) [x5]
