We had a meeting at the farmer's market
And talked over a bottle of wine
A parliament; my cigarette, he sparked it
And I knew I was playing with fire
Man I shouldn't have come here alone
I've been looking for love in all the wrong places
Been telling myself I'm grown
But when I look in his eyes I'm his girl and he knows it

You kiss like you love me now
You know I can't tune that out
Your frequency hits me less frequently
I have to haunt your dreams
You can't stay mad at me
Just cause we're "supposed to be" don't mean we're gonna be

You can still break my heart
Even if we're only messing around
Something's different now
I'm just thinking out loud
And I try to be cool
But my feelings keep pulling me down
I'm different now
I'm just thinking out loud

I got my armour you can call me heartless
But I'm the one you're leaving behind
I tried to finishï»¿ what we never started
To get the stigma outta my mind
And I shouldn't have come here alone
When we do the wrong thing it hurts sometimes
But it feels like you're coming home
When I look in his eyes I'm his girl and he knows it

Making love to me now
You know I can't tune that out
Your frequency hits me less frequently
I have to haunt your dreams
You can't stay mad at me
Just cause we're "supposed to be" don't mean we're gonna be

You can still break my heart
Even if we're only messing around
Something's different now
I'm just thinking out loud
And I try to be cool
But my feelings keep pulling me down
I'm different now
I'm just thinking out loud
You can still break my heart
Even if we're only messing around
Something's different now
I'm just thinking out loud
And I try to be cool
But my feelings keep pulling me down
I'm different now
I'm just thinking out loud
