I don't wanna stay home tonight
Just wanna go out with my girls
Find some fellas that we like
And I just got a new fit (uh huh)
I got the matchin shoes to go with it
And I'm lookin good when I'm in it

But I'm only fifteen and the bouncers at the door all want ID
I can flirt but they won't let me in
I'll take it to the street then

We gonna party in the street outside the club
Cause we can't get in, we not old enough
We gonna get it poppin, make it hot
Gonna bring my record in the parkin lot
And when the club close down and it's time to go
We'll be out here hostin the after-show
We gonna keep it poppin, keep it hot
Gonna bring the record in the parkin lot

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
