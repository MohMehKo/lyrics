[Ray J:]
Silly games, foolish lies, all that I'm used to
But you arrived in my life and before I knew
It was a drastic change in feelings
And it's hard for me to deal with
How good that you treat me, yeah
Cause your action speaks louder than your words
Most of all you show me good loving I deserve
Ooh, this is scary, how fast I'm falling
But so many questions in my mind

[JoJo:]
Could this be, is this the
Beginning of the rest of my life
Boy, I want nothing more
Than to have you here by my side
But it feels like it's too good to be true
And I'm diving into the deep end of love

Seems I'm headed for uncharted waters
Love me in so many ways that I never thought of
I've never been here before
So I'm trusting you to show me the way

[Ray J:]
You submerge me in your arms
I never felt so much comfort
I'm helplessly in love
Everything that I've been waiting for
You're all that I need and more, more
It's hard to conceive
That you're always on time
And it's hard to believe that you know
Every little thing that I like, ooh I like
Being with you is like a blessing, I just don't know

[JoJo:]
Could this be, is this the
Beginning of the rest of my life
Boy, I want nothing more
Than to have you here by my side
But it feels like it's too good to be true
And I'm diving into the deep end of love

Seems I'm headed for uncharted waters
Love me in so many ways that I never thought of
I've never been here before
So I'm trusting you to show me the way

Could this be, is this the

Love me in so many ways that I never thought of
