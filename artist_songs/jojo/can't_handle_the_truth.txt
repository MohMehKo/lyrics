You knew something was scandalous 
You told me you could handle it
But if I told you everything, 
You wouldn't believe me

It’s someone that you met before
You even shook his hand at the door 
It was last 4th of July 
When we got into that big fight

You seemed more concerned with the girls by the pool
He held my conversation, something you don’t do
You left me vulnerable, so irresponsible 
Why are you confused?

If you could handle the truth I'd never lie to you
If you did what you’re supposed to do I’d still be with you
You’re so busy loving yourself 
There’s no room for anyone else 
But the truth is, if you could handle the truth I’d never...

I would never lie, never lie, never lie
But you don’t even try, even try, even try 
I hate lying to you, but you can’t handle the truth 
I would never lie, never lie, never lie
But you don’t even try, even try, even try 
I hate lying to you, but you can’t handle the truth 

I’m so fucking mad at you
Look at what you made me do
You turned a good girl so bad 
And it’s all your fault

But you couldn't give a little love
Your affection would have been enough 
But now I’m the one up in the club 
And I’m leaving my phone off

Which brings me back to that day by the pool
He invited me out, something you used to do
Wanted to tell you but deep down I knew 
Your ego’s so big that it might leave you bruised

If you could handle the truth I'd never lie to you
If you did what you’re supposed to do I’d still be with you
You’re so busy loving yourself,
There’s no room for anyone else
I just don't belong here
If you could handle the truth I’d never...
I never wanted too

I would never lie, never lie, never lie
But you don’t even try, even try, even try 
I hate lying to you, but you can’t handle the truth
(Look at what you made me do)
I would never lie, never lie, never lie
(It's all your fault)
But you don’t even try, even try, even try 
I hate lying to you, but you can’t handle the truth

Can't handle the truth...
