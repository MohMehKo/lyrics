So many ways to say it
I can think of a few
See I could be cold about it
Or just play it cool
I could just string you along
Telling lies and hiding the truth
See, but if I went that route
That would make me no better than you
Here's what I'm gonna do

Don't call here no more
We have nothing else to discuss
Baby do what you must
Just don't call here no more
Boy, this is the end of us
On that you can trust
Don't call here no more

Baby, I'll make it simple and plain
Just like you did when you were with her
Forget you even know my name, know my name
Fire and desire, baby boy you put out the flame
So, you have been retired
Prominently put out the game so 

Don't call here no more
We have nothing else to discuss
Baby do what you must
Just don't call here no more
Boy, this is the end of us
On that you can trust
Don't call here no more

There is nothing you can say
That's gonna make me change the way
That I feel about you now
So don't even waste your time
Calling me cause you may find
That someone else is around

Don't call here no more
Don't call here no more
It's for your own good
You may call and
Have somebody picking up the phone
And it's not gonna be me

Don't call here no more
We have nothing else to discuss
Baby do what you must
Just don't call here no more
Boy, this is the end of us
On that you can trust
Don't call here no more
