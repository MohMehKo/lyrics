Sometimes I get overwhelmed.
There are so many dreams that I have for myself.
Some say I won't persevere,
But their words and their ignorance can't interfere.

'Cause I know,
That my drive exceeds circumstance,
And my passion is clear when I'm given a chance,
So, hate on me hater, I turn down the fader,
I wanna break down the walls, matter of fact,
I want it all!

I wanna be the one, I wanna be on top,
I wanna taste the sun, I wanna never stop.
I wanna light the sky, overall really,
All I want is everything.

I wanna touch the stars, I wanna feel the fire,
Wanna speak my mind, I wanna be inspired,
I make a change, in the end really,
All I want is everything.

Who says that your goals are mere fantasies?
Promise you won't lose focus from their jealousy.
'Cause our world, is in our hands,
We gotta mould it and colour and shape it,
No reason why we can't.
We can have it all!

I wanna be the one, I wanna be on top (Oooooo),
I wanna taste the sun, I wanna never stop.
I wanna light the sky, overall really,
All I want is everything (I just want everything).

I wanna touch the stars, I wanna feel the fire (I wanna feel the fire),

Wanna speak my mind, I wanna be inspired (Oooooo),
I make a change, in the end really,
All I want is everything (In the end all I want is everything).

I want the city streets, I want the picket fence,
I want the privacy, I want the camera lens,
I want my Beethoven, I want some rock and roll,
I wanna be the first and (aaahhhh) last,
I wanna stay at home, I wanna see the world,
I wanna date around, be your only girl,
I wanna doctorate and still be rockin' it

Is that too much to ask? Tell me!

I wanna be the one, I wanna be on top,
I wanna taste the sun, I wanna never stop.
I wanna light the sky, overall really,
All I want is everything (Wooooooaaaaaahhhhh).

I wanna touch the stars, I wanna feel the fire (Feel the fire),
Wanna speak my mind, I wanna be inspired (Speak my mind, be inspired),
I make a change, in the end really,
All I want is everything (All I want is everything).

I wanna be the one, I wanna be on top (Onnnnneeeee),
I wanna taste the sun, I wanna never stop (Never stop).
I wanna light the sky, overall really (Overall really),
All I want is everything (All I want is everything).

I wanna touch the stars, I wanna feel the fire (All I that want, All I that need),
Wanna speak my mind, I wanna be inspired,
I make a change, in the end really,
All I want is everything (In the end all I want is everything).
