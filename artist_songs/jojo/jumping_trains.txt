We keep chugging along 
On a road to nowhere 
Nobody's out there 
I'm not even here anymore 
You're kinda boring me 
You got stuck in your comfort zone 
And it makes me so uncomfortable 
And it's not my fault 
That you're glued to your seat 
I'm sorry 

Our love fell off the track 
Cause you just hold me back 
Baby your heart is just too strange 
I can't just be your girl 
I need to see the world 
If that's something you can't arrange 
Then I'll be jumping trains 

(I'll be jumpin, I'll be jumpin) 
(I'll be jumpin, I'll be jumpin) 
I'll be jumping trains 

Last time we went out
I remember snowflakes on the ground 
But now, I look outside 
On the sunny fields of green (ohh) 
And I hope for the freedom
That I once had with the wind in my hair 
And my life on track 
Getting cabin fever
I just need the chance to run around

Our love fell off the track 
Cause you just hold me back 
Baby your heart is just too strange 
I can't just be your girl 
I need to see the world 
If that's something you can't arrange 
Then I'll be jumping train

Mr. Conductor can you 
Stop this train right now 
Cause if I stay here with him 
My life will just slow down 
And a girl like me just needs to be free
(I'll be jumpin, I'll be jumpin) 
(I'll be jumpin, I'll be jumpin) 

Our love fell off the track 
Now I'm not looking back 
Baby your heart is just too strange 
I can't just be your girl 
I need to see the world 
If that's something you can't arrange 
Then I'll be jumping trains 

I'll be jumping (yeah) trains 

If that's something you can't arrange 
Then I'll be jumping trains 
(I'll be jumpin, I'll be jumpin) 
(I'll be jumpin, I'll be jumpin) 
(I'll be jumpin, I'll be jumpin trains) 
And I'll be jumping trains
