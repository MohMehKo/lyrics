I heard nickel in your heart, in your heart
It was worth save it, so I thought, so I thought
But time passed us by, wasn't on our side
Think it skipped us
And if all our dreams weren't meant to be,
Can I miss them?

So far from Heaven with nowhere to run
Should've seen it coming, but we followed the sun
Far from perfect in this universe
No use fixing the things that never work
So far from Heaven,
So far from Heaven

If only I could see through your eyes, through your eyes
I could understand every reason why, or at least try
If I told you things that you wanted to hear,
Would you listen?
Every piece you see that you took from me,
They were given!

So far from Heaven with nowhere to run
Should've seen it coming, but we followed the sun
Far from perfect in this universe
No use fixing the things that never work
Far from Heaven
So far from Heaven
Far from Heaven

So far from me,
I'm slipping away
So far from me,
Keep slipping away
So far from me,
Keep slipping away
Keep slipping away
Keep slipping away

So far from Heaven with nowhere to run
Should've seen it coming, but we followed the sun
Far from perfect in this universe
No use fixing the things that never work
So far from Heaven
So far from Heaven...
