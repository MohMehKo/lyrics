Where am I? Need to get out
Who am I? Figure it out
Trapped inside my own shell
My mind, holding me down
Question, what's this about?
Not feeling like myself
Not feeling like myself

[Pre-Chorus:]
What's real keeps shiftin'
Can't feel the ground beneath me
I'm hanging on the edge, and I'm

[Chorus:]
Afraid to hold on, afraid to let go
Too scared to venture into the unknown
My heart says move on, I'm ready to run
Waiting for courage
'Cause I'm stuck in limbo, limbo, limbo
I'm stuck in limbo, limbo
And I ain't tryin' to be stuck no more

It's time to take a chance
Right now, no turning back
Forget my fear of failing
What's worth risking my life
It's my choice to try to fly
And I chose to break free
And I chose to break free

[Pre-Chorus:]
What's real keeps shiftin'
Can't feel the ground beneath me
I'm hanging on the edge, and I'm

[Chorus:]
Afraid to hold on, afraid to let go
Too scared to venture into the unknown
My heart says move on, I'm ready to run
Waiting for courage
'Cause I'm stuck in limbo, limbo, limbo
I'm stuck in limbo, limbo
And I ain't tryin' to be stuck no more

[Bridge:]
I wanna run, run, run, run
Wanna run to freedom
Try to find the strength within me

[Chorus:]
Afraid to hold on, afraid to let go
Too scared to venture into the unknown
My heart says move on, I'm ready to run
Waiting for courage
'Cause I'm stuck in limbo, limbo, limbo
I'm stuck in limbo, limbo, limbo
Limbo, limbo, limbo
I'm stuck in limbo, limbo
And I ain't tryin' to be stuck no more, no more, no more

No more, no more, no more, no more
