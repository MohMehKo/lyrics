Sometimes you love me
Like a good boy oughta 
Sometimes you hurt me so bad
My tears running like water
You get me out
Right before your friends
Then you disown me baby
Until we're alone again

Your love is like a seesaw
Your love is like a seesaw baby
Your love is like a seesaw
Going up (up) and down (down) all around
It's like a seesaw baby

Sometimes you tell me you love me
You're my sweet candy man
And then sometimes baby
I don't know where I stand
You lift me up
When I'm on the ground
But then as soon as I get up child
You send me tumbling down

Now, your love is like a seesaw
Your love is like a seesaw baby
Your love is like a seesaw
Going up (up), down (down) all around
Just like a seesaw baby

When I kiss you and I like it
And I ask you to kiss me again
When I reach for you
You start to run out of sight
And you take that away from me
That ain't right, that just ain't right

Now, your love is like a seesaw
Your love is like a seesaw baby
Your love is like a seesaw
Going up (up), down (down) all around
Just like a seesaw baby

Your love is like a seesaw
Your love, your love is like a seesaw
It just ain't right
Your love is like, like a seesaw
