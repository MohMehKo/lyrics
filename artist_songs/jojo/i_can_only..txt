[Jojo:]
I learned the hard way on how to let go
So here we go
Feel the adrenaline takin' control
Get high, no low
This moment of truth hidden under my tongue
No longer numb
Running like rain when I thought it dried up
Can't get enough

I'm climbing up these walls
I'm invincible
Even if I fall
I fall on me
Got myself alive
Up here in the sky
My ecstasy

I can only drink what I wanna drink
I can only say what I wanna say
I can only think what I wanna think
Don't hate me, don't hate
I can only love who I wanna love
I can only smoke what I wanna smoke
I can only fuck who I wanna fuck
Don't hate me, don't hate
I-I I can only, I-I I can only, I-I I can only
Don't hate me, don't hate

[Alessia Cara:]
All that you gettin' is all that you see
I'm cool with it
Nothing else ever made much sense to me
I'm not doing it

I'm climbing up these walls
I'm invincible
Even if I fall
I fall on me
Got myself alive
Up here in the sky
My ecstasy

I can only do what I wanna do
I can only say what I wanna say
I can only think what I wanna think
Don't hate me, don't hate
I can only love who I wanna love
I can only look how I wanna look
I can only be what I wanna be
Don't hate me, don't hate
I-I I can only, I-I I can only, I-I I can only
Don't hate me, don't hate
I-I I can only, I-I I can only, I-I I can only

[Jojo:]
Pour a drink and own it up
Here's a toast, there's only one

I can only drink what I wanna drink
I can only say what I wanna say
I can only think what I wanna think
Don't hate me, don't hate
I can only love who I wanna love
I can only smoke what I wanna smoke
I can only fuck who I wanna fuck
Don't hate me, don't hate
I-I I can only, I-I I can only, I-I I can only
Don't hate me, don't hate
I-I I can only, I-I I can only, I-I I can only
