I saw you walking kinda my way
I didn't know what to do
I wondered if it's the game I should play
But Imma stay true to you
And everytime you turn your eyes to me, yeah
I'm thinking maybe together we could be

Because you and me were meant to be
Made for each other and you're my lover
'Cause what you got is hard to find
To be with you just makes my mind go crazy, yeah
Makes my mind go crazy, yes now

You hold me close when I'm in your arms, so lovely
Even sad I know that you're the one for me
I like the way you walk your frenzy style, so sexy
The way you are just makes me smile

Because you and me were meant to be
Made for each other and you're my lover
'Cause what you got is hard to find
To be with you just makes my mind go crazy, yeah
Makes my mind go crazy

And you are the only one I want next to me
You got my love for eternity, yeah
Makes my mind go crazy
Makes my mind go crazy
Makes my mind go crazy
Makes my mind go crazy
