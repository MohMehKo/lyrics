Honestly it's kind of hard to live
When it's just me on my own
I'm goin' through the hard times,
And this is the farthest it has gone 
I'm stayin' strong but it ain't so easy
Maybe from your way it seems so clearly
But I realize the try
It makes us stronger through our fights

'Cause the man above is there
When you need a helpin' hand
And all the good times are rare
As it gets harder towards the end (Yeah)
Why does he make us struggle
When it's difficult as it is
But now I see it makes us stronger
So when it's done we see what the difference is

I'm stayin' true to myself and I
Will forever thank the Lord above
And deep inside I always wonder why
Why he has to make it so hard
I do my best but he keeps on pushin' it
All of this stress it just keeps on buildin'
But as we pass our fears
We start to see the end more clear

'Cause the man above is there
When you need a helpin' hand
And all the good times are rare
As it gets harder towards the end (Yeah)
Why does he make us struggle
When it's difficult as it is
But now I see it makes us stronger
So when it's done we see what the difference is

We have our bumpy roads 
Woah, woah
And we don't know which way to go 
No, no
But if you let him lead the way
You'll find out that you'll live in a better day (a better day)
So listen to me say

Why does he make us struggle
When it's difficult as it is
But now I see it makes us stronger
So when it's done we see what the difference is [x2]
