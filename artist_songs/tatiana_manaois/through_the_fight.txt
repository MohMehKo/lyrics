When you take your first steps into life
It seems so fast
If you looking from before and now
To where you're at
Gotta figure out what you want most
To be in this place
Whether you succeed or not it's coming your way
But when it does

Stick your ground you'll never fall down and
Try again til you get it right
No matter whether you win and lose just know you made it
Through the fight
Stick your ground you'll never fall down and
Try again til you get it right
No matter whether you win and lose just know you made it
Through the fight
Through the fight

People walk around with hurt inside
And they can't let it go
Til they realize, break down and cry
And then they know
What they tried to fix from way before
Is finally done
Be ready for the next time
So that
When it comes you know to

Stick your ground you'll never fall down and
Try again til you get it right
No matter whether you win and lose just know you made it
Through the fight
Stick your ground you'll never fall down and
Try again til you get it right
No matter whether you win and lose just know you made it
Through the fight
Through the fight

You know you made it through the fight
Through the fight

You know you made it through the fight

Cause you know you made it
Through the
Fight
