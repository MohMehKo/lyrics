I wanna make you mine
Take you everywhere I go
Never thought I'd find
Someone I could call my own

And I should say
As I'm on my way, to you
That I love you, I love you
I really do

It was December
Yes I remember
The way that you were always there for me

I didn't know you, but I could show you
Yes I could show you definitely
See...
We were strangers
With such contradiction

Should I go?
I don't know
Who should I listen to?

My heart was there and so were you
Now honestly there was nothing left to do

But to make you mine
And take you everywhere I go
Never thought I'd find
Someone I could call my own

And I should say
As I'm on my way, to you, you
That I love you, I love you
I really do
I really do

There's no one in the world I'd rather see
Your beautiful face in the morning
Now,
I know of course you disagree
But it's such beauty
So lovely, oh

Your super soft skin
Where do I begin?
Why don't I go from head to toe, here we go

Your eyes
Your lips
Your nose
Your cheeks
Your ears and
How they pay close attention to me

Your hands
Your touch
The way I blush because of what your touch does to me

Don't forget the way you look into my eyes
I swear that you've got me under a spell
But I don't mind just keep me there
Because I love it, if you can't tell

And when I fall you always catch me
And when I call to see if you're free
I'm waiting for you at your front door to tell you
You're the only one that I adore

And I should say
As I make my way, to you, you
That I love you, I love you
I love you

So will you be mine?
I'll take you everywhere I go
I never thought I'd find
Someone I could call my own

And I should say
As I'm on my way, to you, you
That I love you, I love you
I really do
I really do
