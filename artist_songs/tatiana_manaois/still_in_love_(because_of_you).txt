I don't know the perfect line to write
To turn this all around
And I don't know how to change their minds
But I know that my heart is on the ground

It could be just the way I feel
Tell me it's wrong and I'll show you it's real
'Cuz I, I don't wanna fly fly fly
High up in the sky sky sky, so high

Because of you
You showed me what it's like
You told me that in life we have to fight
for what we can't go a day without

Because of you
I'm suffocating please
You're the air I breath
And I'll never get enough

'Cuz baby I'm still in love

This is no ordinary pain
Oh by the way, my tears hit this guitar
Just promise me you'll stay the same
'Cuz I love love you just the way you are

Believe it or not baby
You keep me on top yeah yeah
Even if I fall fall fall
I know you're there through it all all all

And it's all because of you
You showed me what it's like
You told me that in life we have to fight
for what we can't go a day without

Because of you
I'm suffocating please
You're the air I breath
And I'll never get enough

'Cuz baby I'm still in love

I don't know the perfect line to write
I don't know how to change their minds
But if you would just take my hand tonight
I will ask you to stay with me for the rest of my life

It's all because of you
You showed me what it's like
You told me that in life we have to fight
for what we can't go a day without

It's all because of you
I'm suffocating please
You're the air I breath
And I'll never get enough

'Cuz baby I'm still in love

There's no way I could let you go
And if we don't try we'll never know
There's no way I could let you go
And if we don't try we'll never know
