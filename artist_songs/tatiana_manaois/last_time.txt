You sit today,
Then you walked away
Just leave me,
Don't leave me.

You've always got your way,
But when I scream your name
Can you hear me?
You can't hear me

I've cried a thousand times
And I don't know where you are
Where did you go?
I need you here, but you let it go.

And now you wanna come back into my life
Now you wanna come back into my life
I don't understand why you think it's right
Think you wink and pick up when we left up last time
But that was the last time

You see, last time you said this was slow
You said you didn't have to go, but then,
Then I saw your suitcase,
See me with a new face
Left in a place I didn't know
Can't you see that I'm trying
No, no, no, I ain't lying
Just 'cause you're ready doesn't mean that I am.

You never were around when I was feeling down
Can you help me? you can't help me.
I know I see you once in a while
But as a child, it ain't healthy for me.

I've cried a thousand times
And I don't know where you are
Where did you go?
I need you here, but you let it go.
So I let go.

Now you wanna come back into my life
Now you wanna come back into my life
I don't understand why you think it's right
Think you wink and pick up when we left up last time
But that was the last time.

And now your thoughts never match mine
I keep saying it's the last time
Like I said, last time, oh.

Take this way off your shoulders
I'm stronger now that I'm older
But she never forget what you showed her

You see, last time you said this was slow
You said you didn't have to go, but then
Then I saw your suitcase,
See me with a new face
Left in a place I didn't know
Can't you see that I'm trying
No no no I ain't lying
But just 'casue you're ready doesn't mean that I am.
