Of course I don't want you to leave me here,
For goodness sake it's Christmas stay with me
The day that I decided to make you mine, oh mine,
You shoulda known I played for keeps

And, you work so hard
I've never been
So proud
No one supports you more than me

Oh but now it's cold,
And you gotta go
No you can't be home right now, my dear
But I guess it's okay,
I know you can't stay
Just promise me you'll be here,
To kiss me into the new year

Your telephone is ringing on and on
No it won't feel like Christmas if you leave
And I know you hate when I ask you a thousand times
But baby why can't you just stay with me?

I always see you work so hard
I've never been
So proud
I'll be the first to let you know

Oh but now it's cold,
And you gotta go,
No you can't be home right now, my dear
But I guess it's okay,
I know you can't stay
Just promise me you'll be here
To kiss me into the new year

(New year) new year
(New year) new year
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Said I'll be waiting
You know I'm waiting
Said I'll be waiting babe

Said I
Said I'll be waiting babe
You know I'll be waiting babe
Said I'll be waiting babe

Cause now it's cold,
And you gotta go,
No you can be home right now, my dear
And I wish you could stay,
But I guess it's okay
Just promise me you'll be here
To kiss me into the new year
