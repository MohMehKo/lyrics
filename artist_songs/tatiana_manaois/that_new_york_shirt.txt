I could care less about your clothes
Cause I care more about where you wanna go
I could care less about your hair
Cause you look beautiful just leave it there, I swear

Whenever you wear that New York shirt
It doesn't matter who loved who first
Cause if anybody loved someone
I love you more than two birds
Flying in the sky, yo
You're heaven in my eyes, hey

And I don't care about what's new
Cause I'm not interested in anything but you

Man I want that new shirt, from Topshop
Cause I just wanted to be another hotshot
But then you walked in more plain than Jane
Yet somehow you seem way better than fame
Honestly, nothin' else mattered to me
But you which whom I was so flattered to see
Cause we, flow better than this melody I'm writing
Definitely something worth fighting for
I'm yours
If you wanna rock with me, rock with me
If you wanna talk to me, babe
If you wanna lay with me, lay with me
If you wanna stay with me, stay with me
We don't even need a diamond ring, no

Cause I don't care about what's new
I'm not interested in anything but you
Anything but you

Whenever you wear that New York shirt
It doesn't matter who loved who first
Cause if anybody loved someone
I love you more than two birds [x2]
Flying in the sky, yo
You're heaven in my eyes, hey

And I don't care about what's new
Cause I'm not interested in anything but you
