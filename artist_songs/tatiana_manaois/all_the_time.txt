If this was a long song
And I told you
To be with me until we grow old would you
Would you wait?
Could you stay?
Could I have your hand to hold?
But I don't have a love song
And I'm sorry
I wish I didn't have to be far
But we grew apart
I'm stuck in the dark
Oh and when you left you took the stars

I know I
Didn't treat you
Treat you right
But I need you 
To be mine
Do you think you could be mine,
If I learned how to love you?

So could you show me how to love you?
Cause I wanna love you, yeah yeah
So could you show me how to love you?
Cause I wanna love you love you

(Going crazy every night)
(Going crazy every night)
I've been going crazy every night
(Going crazy every night)
(Going crazy every night)
Ever since you left my side
(Ever since you left my side)
(Ever since you left my side)
You're the only one I want
(You're the only one I want)
(You're the only one I want)
Oh and I want you all the time

I know that you're nervous
I know that you're scared baby this isn't worth it
But I love you on purpose
And you disagree but I think that you're perfect

Baby give me one more chance to be the one to hold your hand
Maybe we could learn to love again
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

So could you show me how to love you?
Cause I wanna love you, yeah yeah yeah
So could you show me how to love you?
Cause I wanna love you love you

(Going crazy every night)
(Going crazy every night)
I've been going crazy every night
(Going crazy every night)
(Going crazy every night)
Ever since you left my side
(Ever since you left my side)
(Ever since you left my side)
You're the only one I want
(You're the only one I want)
(You're the only one I want)
Oh and I want you all the time

Yeah yeah yeah 
And I want you all the time
Oh...
And I want you all the time
(You've got something I want)
And I want you
(You've got something I need)
Oh I need you
I will never leave you
(We could both be in love)
And I want you
(We could conquer our dreams[?])
Oh I need you
I will never leave you

Cause I've been going crazy baby
(Going crazy every night)
(Going crazy every night)

Ever since you
Ever since you left my side
(Ever since you left my side)
No no no

Maybe we could learn to love again)
