Oh, ooh

Lately I've been waking up
Wondering what you're dreaming of 
Before you fell asleep
Before you counted sheep
I said I'll never be enough

But I know
Without a doubt I'm no good with words
'Cause I don't know where to start
But I know
Whenever I get the chance to learn
My love will speak for my heart

Speaking of love,
I thought I should mention that you,
Are always on my mind
And just as I'm giving up,
Something tells me me and you
Should give it one more try
But our love is blind
And sometimes it's floating away
And it's crazy, how you tell me
You love me.

I always want to take you for a ride
'Cause I hate when you get pissed off 
At the stress that's on your mind. 
And I know that I can't see you everyday
And I'm sorry that when I do,
I don't have much to say

Oh baby 
Without a doubt I'm no good with words
'Cause I don't know where to start
But I know
Whenever I get the chance to learn
My love will speak for my heart

But speaking of love,
I thought I should mention that you,
Are always on my mind
And just as I'm giving up,
Something tells me me and you
Should give it one more try
But our love is blind
And sometimes it's floating away
And it's crazy, how you tell me
You love me
How you tell me
You love me

Ooh, oh
