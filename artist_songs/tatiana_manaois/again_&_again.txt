It's been about 4 months and I swear baby I'm doing just fine
But every time I
Try to write
Whoa oh oh
You make your way back into my mind
Oh and you say
That I'm your one and only love
But everytime you walked away
Whoa oh oh
You told me that I just wasn't enough
It's so strange how were strangers now but I miss you but I don't miss how
I was your only friend
But you broke my heart again
And again

Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh

Look at me
When I walk away
How could you turn the other way
I would've done anything for you
I wanted you back
Would've been nice
If I couldn't find you for the rest of my life but now I know why
I'm not suppose to be loving you

And now I'm free now you want me
But could you love me, baby
Could you love me
Oh the way that I
Hey, I used to love you
Cause I used to love you
But you couldn't love me
No

So it's been about 4 months
And I swear baby I'm doing just fine
But every time I try to write
Whoa oh oh
You make your way back into my mind
It's so strange how were strangers now but I miss you
But I don't miss
How I was your only friend
But you broke my heart again
And again

You broke my heart
You broke my heart
I swear baby I'm doing just fine
Oh yeah and I swear baby I'm not outta my mind
