Bare with me on this one
It's been a minute, since I've been in my feels
But this is what I'm feeling
You tried to play your games, but you don't play fair
I would have sang to you and played with your hair
Oh, but you you you
You didn't want forever, you just wanted pleasure
And I won't lie, we could have been so good together
But I could do much better on my own, yeah I know
That I could do much better on my own, yeah I know

Now I don't have too much to say, so there's no need to listen close
Do you need somebody or do you need me the most
Don't let my love go to waste
I was down to wait
But you can't even tell it to my face
That you you you
No you don't want forever, you just want the pleasure, baby
And I won't lie, we could be so damn good together
But I could do much better on my own, yeah I know
I could do much better on my own
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah ya yeah

I said I'm better on my own
I'm better on my own
Oh yeah ya yeah, oh yeah ya yeah
I'm better on my own
I'm better on my own
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah ya yeah

If you're better on your own and you wanna let him know
Say yeah ya yeah, yeah ya yeah
If you're better on your own
Say yeah ya yeah yeah
Said if you're better oh on your own
Let me hear you say yeeaahh owwww
Oh yeah I know, babe
Said I could do much better on my own
I said I'm better on my own, babe

I said I could do much better
I could do much better
I could do much better
Said I could do much better
I could do much better
Said I could do much better
Said I could do much better on my own, baby
