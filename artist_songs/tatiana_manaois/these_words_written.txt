The morning sun chases the moon
While I get caught chasing after you
But nothing seems to get in the way
As the sun sets just before the end of the day
And even if the worlds in between
The stars will lead me home even if I walk alone
You are home to me
I just wish the world could see
But I guess it's forbidden
Because of these words written
So without your permission
My broken heart would say I'm in love
Say I'm in love
You think it's just a phase
Why don't you look at me the same?
You're saying that you're fine with it
You say you've never minded it
Oh we're no more ways around
And you wonder why I took so long
To tell you
I don't really want to talk about it
Cause everything I have to say, you doubt it
Just look at where we are
And you're the one that wants to push me away
And you don't even want to let me explain
But you can break a heart
You can break my heart
Cause I guess it's forbidden
Because of these words written
So without your permission
My broken heart would say I'm in love
Woah, say I'm in love
And I don't need you to tell me
I don't need you to help me
I don't need you to tell me what I'm feeling inside
I'm in love
