You got to get up
You got to get up and make a move
'Cause the world will never see you until you do
No, they don't really care what you're going through
So you got to show them, baby
You got to show them the real you
You got to give them what you've got
No, don't let them see what you're not

'Cause you are strong, you are wise
You are worth beyond the thousand reasons why
And you can't be perfect, baby
'Cause nobody's perfect, darling
But, no, no, no, there's nobody in the world like you

What do you do when you can't let go?
What do you say when you just don't know how you feel?
And you know nobody knows how you feel
'Cause everybody's got their own damn problem
So everybody's trying to find their way
And day by day is the struggle
In this world you know you have to hustle
Just know that you're not alone
You don't always have to be strong all by yourself
I said, it's okay to ask for help

Now listen, people will find you, but they don't define you
And you will find people who'll help redesign you
People will find you, but they don't define you
And you will find people who'll help redesign you
You are a work of art
Bet you didn't think you'd come this far
Now here you are

Baby, you are strong, you are wise
You are worth beyond the thousand reasons why
And you can't be perfect, baby
'Cause nobody's perfect darling
But, no, no, no, there's nobody in the world like you

You know you're worth it, 'cause you know that you can't be perfect, baby
'Cause nobody's perfect, darling
I love you just the way that you are
I love you just the way that you are, my love
It's like the stars in the sky, oh, when you look in my eyes
