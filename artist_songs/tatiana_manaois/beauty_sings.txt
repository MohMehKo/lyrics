Let's ride to the sunset
I could be your best friend
Love will take us by surprise
And I'll watch you grow,
You'll be beautiful
We will spread our wings and we'll fly

And if you let me explore you
I will sing for you
Just before you sleep
But in this case love
Your beauty sings
And it goes

Ooh ohhh ooh oohhh oooh ooohh oh
Ohhh ohhh oh ohhh ohh ohhhh ohh ohh
Ohh oh oh ohhhh ohh oh oh

This past week
I've been losing sleep
'Cause I'm so used to holding your hand
And but it feels like I've been getting lost
And if I kept count it'd be a lot
But every time I find myself with you

So just let me explore you
I will sing for you
Just before you sleep
But in this case love
Your beauty sings to me

Why can't we love someone we love?
Isn't this my heart?
And isn't the loneliness enough
To tear us apart?
And even if I change my ways
Love won't let me stay

'Cause I've let you explore me
Will you sing for me
You don't need melody
'Cause in this case love
Your beauty sings
And it goes...
