The level of stress is getting to me,
It's reaching all the way to my neck
And I've been too weak.
For two weeks I've been holding my breath
But I can't catch it.

Get me outta this place
It's way to dark 
I don't know how to escape
I just need room to breath
To clear my mind

But I find it hard
to let my heart decide
On what it thinks will make things right
for us, 'cause I don't wanna give up
If this is a war between the good and bad
Then, baby, I'm fighting with all I have.
Yeah, just to make you feel loved.

Now, I'm not asking for too much
Just don't make me choose, no.
Don't make me choose, no.
'Cause I can't help it.
I need both of you
So, don't make me choose, no.
Don't make me choose, no.
'Cause I can't help it
So, don't make me choose 
between the two.

Now I'm reaching out as far as I can 
I can't get in touch 
I can't remember what holdin' your hand was like.
But I'll be alright. alright, alright, alright.

Now, listen to me.
Don't you understand what
this is doing?
You think I can handle this?
You're sinking all my battleships.

But I find it hard to 
let my heart decide 
on what it thinks 
will make things right for us.
'cause I don't wanna give up.
If this is a war between the good and bad.
Then, baby, I'm fighting with all I have.
Just to make you feel loved.

Now I'm not asking for to much
I will give you all my love.
Just don't make me choose.
I need both of you.
And I'm hoping you 
won't make me choose 
between the two.
'cause either way I'll loose.
I need both of you.
Please don't make me
It will break me
If you make me choose.

Don't make me choose, no.
'cause I can't help it. 
I need both of you.
So, don't make me choose, no.
Don't make me choose, no.
'cause I can't help it.
So, don't make me choose 
between the two.
