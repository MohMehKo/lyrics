It's all...

All I see is red and green
I know it's cold outside but you should come with me and see
There's a wreath on that door
Look at all these pretty lights
I swear I've seen this before
I get sigh loss track of time
'Cause I swear yesterday
I was only three
Now it's already Christmas

It's all-It's already Christmas
It's all-It's already Christmas

Oh here we are, once again
Bunch of family, bunch of friends
Oh sing with me, pretty please, yea
Oh sing with me, yea
You could tell me what you want to do
And I will be down, cause I'm down for you, yea
I'm down for you, yea
Hey-ey-ey

Look at the times we've had
Look at the life we live
This is the perfect chance, the perfect chance to give
Look at the times we've had
Look at the life we live
This is the perfect chance, the perfect chance to give

'Cause I swear yesterday
I was only three
Now it's already Christmas
'Cause I swear yesterday
I was only three
Now it's all-it's all
It's already Christmas

Look at the times we've had
Look at the life we live
This is the perfect chance, the perfect chance to give
I said look at the times we've had
Look at the life we live
This is the perfect chance, the perfect chance to give

Look at the times we've had
Look at the life we live
This is the perfect chance to give, to give
Look at the times we've had
Look at the life we live
This is the perfect chance to give, to give
