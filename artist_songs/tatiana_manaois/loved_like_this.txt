Am I supposed to let you know?
Am I supposed to let you go, 
and be free babe.
I know you’re no good for me
But what good is “good for me”
If with you is where I want to be.

And I’ve seen you break a heart before,
And I’ve been hurt so many times 
I don’t wanna hurt no more
But maybe you don’t know what it is
To be love-oh-loved like this.

To be loved, loved like this
To be loved, loved like this
To be loved, loved like this
To be loved, loved like this

I know you could hurt me,
But maybe you’re hurting.
Has anyone asked you if you’re okay?
‘Cause I know you mean no harm
Can I hold you in my arms?
I’ll try my best to take away the pain.

And I’ve heard you tell a lie before.
And I’ve heard lies so many times
I don’t wanna hear no more.
But maybe you don’t know what it is
To be love-oh-loved like this.

To be loved like 
To be loved like 
To be loved 
Like this

And I’ve seen you break a heart before
But I’ll be fine if you break mine, 
I’m sure.
At least you’ll get to know what it is
To be love-oh-loved
