Day in and day out
Trying to settle on what I should do now
The moon rises, the sun sets
Hoping everything suddenly somehow
Falls in place, finding out the hard way
That nothing works till you work it out (work it out)

It’s happening from left to right
I can’t sleep but I’ll say goodnight
I lie awake till the sun comes up
My mind is still going and my eyes won’t shut
And though I find it hard to believe
I say I moved on but my heart won’t leave
My heart won’t leave
I say I’ve moved on but my heart won’t leave

I’m screaming inside but I don’t know why tears fall from my eyes
Is it because you came here or is it because I can’t face this fear?
It just seemed like the best way to stay quiet inside (stay quiet inside)
Keeping space between you and I wasn’t right
I was just waiting for the right time

Cause day in and day out
Trying to settle on what I should do now
The moon rises, the sun sets
Hoping everything suddenly somehow
Falls in place, finding out the hard way
That nothing works till you work it out (work it out)

I could finish struggling your hands
With the look on your face
Leaving you with the deep sky, a heavy heart
But you walk with a steady trace
Now each thought in the top of my head
Gets caught in my veins so instead
I write it down, pour it out, but it’s unsaid
Before it all gets unread

I’m screaming inside but I don’t know why tears fall from my eyes
Is it because you came here or is it because I can’t face this fear?
It just seemed like the best way to stay quiet inside (to stay quiet inside)
Keeping space between you and I wasn’t right
I was just waiting for the right time

The simpler it gets the harder it seems (the harder it seems)
And I seem to forget the littlest things
Say I’m wrong but it counts too
I was lost so I found you
But it wouldn’t hurt if you found me too
If you found me too

Day in and day out
Trying to settle on what I should do now
The moon rises, the sun sets
Hoping everything suddenly somehow
Falls in place, finding out the hard way
That nothing works till you work it out
