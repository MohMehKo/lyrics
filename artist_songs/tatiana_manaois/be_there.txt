My feet are where my head goes
My head is where my feet lay
“Wake Me Up” playing on replay
I don’t really know how to go about my day
I’m kinda off, everything I touch falls to pieces
I never seem to figure out the reason
Maybe I should really try to think about my feelings
The only time you’re here is when you’re leaving

So if you say you’re here to stay
I won’t take it to the heart
‘Cause if you leave so does a piece of me
And I’m fallin’ all apart

All I ask is that you be there
That you be there
Promise that you’ll be there
That you be there
When I need a friend
When I need a shoulder
When I need someone that I can grow with when I’m older
Promise that you’ll be there
That you’ll be there

So you’re leavin’ in a few days
I never thought that you’d stay
By the time I called that home it was too late
Even if I begged you
You know I don’t get you
Maybe all I need to do is pray
‘Cause you can never recognize the difference
Why is it so hard for you to listen?
Maybe you should really try to think about my feelings
The only time you’re here is when you’re leaving

So if you say you’re here to stay
I won’t take it to the heart
‘Cause if you leave so does a piece of me
And I’m fallin’ all apart

All I ask is that you be there
That you be there
Promise that you’ll be there
That you be there
When I need a friend
When I need a shoulder
When I need someone that I can grow with when I’m older
Promise that you’ll be there
That you’ll be there
Yeah, yeah

Be there for me in times of need when you’re free
‘Cause you know I’ll be there for you
If not, baby, don’t waste your time calling me
When you need someone to care for you
[2x]

When you need someone to care for you
