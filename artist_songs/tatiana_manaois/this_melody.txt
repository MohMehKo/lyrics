When I met you I swear I saw the world in a day
Flying through the sky hearing all the angels pray
The sound of your voice makes me feeling invincible
I can even feel my heartbeat so it's time
To let you know
That I've been
Feeling you for a while now but I can't
Explain what you do to me
When you pass I fall right down to the floor
Make me lose my self esteem
I can't even find the words
To tell you how I feel for you
Baby I ain't got a clue
So I'm a sing you a melody
(Ooh ah ah ah ah [x2])
Everything stops when ever you're around
My heart the drops
But I never hear a sound
And to this day my feelings never change (no way-e-e)
We can only get stronger a love that's longer
Cause forever I'll stay
Feeling you for a while now but I can't
Explain what you do to me
When you pass I fall right down
To the floor
Make me lose
My self esteem
I can't even find the words
To tell you how I feel for you
Baby I ain't got a clue
So I'm a sing you a melody (ah ah ah ah)
Yes it's true oh it's true (baby I)
