In this world of misery
Nothing ever works sometimes
So we all must learn to be
But if we want things right
We only get one chance
So give it all you got
Don't walk away
Cause right now we could make a change
Don't listen to what they say

Finally inside of me I found
The answers so I could keep my ground, woah
And I will not back down today
And I will not back down today
There's nobody who will pass me by
Say you could and I won't let you try
But oh
You won't win a fight this way
So don't think for a second you could break me down

There are some people who will talk you into giving up what you do best
It's just a matter of time til you
Find yourself looking round and there's no one left
You've gotta find your way alone 
Don't worry you will be okay
You won't go down today
No not this way
You will get through it

Finally inside of me I found
The answers so I could keep my ground, woah
And I will not back down today
And I will not back down today
There's nobody who will pass me by
Say you could and I won't let you try
But oh
You won't win a fight this way
So don't think for a second you could break me down

You won't break me down today

[J Jayce:]
Breaking me down you breaking me down, no
Breaking me down you breaking me down, no
Look
Aye
It's J Jayce
Yeah, uh
To think that you'd just try to break me down
And tear me to pieces
No matter what you're saying now
I'm leaving you speechless because the way you used to treat me
Down on me tripping like I can't compete
I look within
Put a fight
Gave it my everything
That's the way you gotta do it if you tryna live your dreams 
And if they try to tell you can't then just listen to me
Tell them that one thing
That you will never break me down

Finally inside of me I found (I found)
The answers so I could keep my ground (I can keep my ground)
And I will not back down today
And I will not back down today
There's nobody who will pass me by (pass me by)
Say you could and I won't let you try (let you try)
But oh
You won't win a fight this way
So don't think for a second you could break me down (second you could break me down)

It's J Jayce

You won't break me down today
You won't win a fight this way
