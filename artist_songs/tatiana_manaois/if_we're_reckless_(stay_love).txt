So what if we're reckless,
We could be reckless together,
And we would be beautiful,
We'll make it do whatever.

You and I, we shine like the north star,
I know it's hard to see 'cause it's so far,
But you know it's always there,
Just so you're well aware,
It'll always be in your heart.

Me and you we get along real well,
Trust me not to say the words that I won't sell,
It's safe with me, no need to plead,
I'm just trying to be the one like your main squeeze.

No need to be afraid if the feeling isn't right,
'Cause people make mistakes, some can't sleep at night,
See life is full of colors, even black and white,
And we all decide a picture, but make sure you make it bright.

And So what if we're reckless,
We could be reckless together,
And we would be beautiful,
We'll make it do whatever.

And you won't have to worry about a thing,
If every day with you is like a dream,
We fight then we make up,
Telling me you'll stay love,
I don't wanna wake up,
Stay love,
Stay love,
I don't wanna wake up.

Every day it's you that I'm thinking of,
And every time I'm away I miss you love,
If you're ever feeling blue then I'll pick you up,
I know you know it's true, you know I'll never give you up,

Even through our darkest days, you know, 
That I will to make a way in you,
Don't believe me when I say it'll be okay,
I could break it down, tell you now we'll go through,
Good and better and best,
And we'll never, ever let it rest,
Till the good gets better,
We'll put it to the test,
Baby now, we're doing our best.

And we'll never, ever let it rest,
Till the good gets better,

Baby now, we're doing our best, yeah.

And when it's cold you keep me warm,
Can't forget the way you keep me calm through every storm,
And I just love, love your company,
And trust me, if it was up to me,
I'd love to be everywhere you go,
Can't get enough, you see,
This is why I miss you more,
Baby, I hate to leave, baby please,
Just know I always want you next to me,
Can't you see, and if you ever feel so lost inside,
I smile with the slightest hope that I crossed your mind,
Cause every time it's getting rough,
I'll be the one to show you love, the one to pick you up,
And yes things might get crazy,
But we can make a way see,
Even I can get out of control, don't be ashamed,
We all make mistakes from time to time and mess up,
Feeling like the only thing to do is to give the rest up,
But guess what, all you gotta do is keep your head up,
And I'll be with you please don't forget us, love.
