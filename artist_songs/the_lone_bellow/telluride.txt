Hickory to Telluride
I act like I've got nothing to hide
Like I ain't got no wrong inside
Hickory to Telluride

Hickory to Telluride
I act like I've got nothing to hide
Like I ain't got no wrong inside
Hickory to Telluride

To hell you ride
To hell you ride
Like I ain't got no wrong inside
Hickory to Telluride

Keep under the valley stool
You got me asleep under the moon
In and out of my dreams in bloom
Hickory you're by my side

To hell you ride
To hell you ride
Like I ain't got no wrong inside
Hickory to Telluride

Broken bones and burn decide
Your blood makes its way into the night
Hands are cold and fever ride
Hickory to Telluride
To hell you ride
To hell you ride
To hell you ride
To hell you
