Heaven don't call me home
Georgia will, Georgia will
I’m on my six string, soapbox, flat top
I'm dressed to kill, dressed to kill
Send me down, Carolina by the 405
Don't shed a tear for me, son, I'll be fine
When I'm dead and gone, Heaven call me home
Damn sure Georgia will

So grab your company
Get free, get free
Oh give me your blood, sweat, microphone twirlin'
Stomp your feet, stomp your feet
Take me down to the shores by the county line
Ogeechee River gonna kiss that sky
When I'm dead and gone, Heaven call me home
Damn sure Georgia will

So tell my band that I'll be travelin' home
And tell my pa I could use some understandin'
And tell my sister they want it all
And this road never was a friend of me so...
Set me free

Heaven don't call me home
Georgia will, Georgia will
I’m on my six string, soapbox, flat top
I'm dressed to kill, dressed to kill
Send me down, Carolina by the 405
Don't shed a tear for me, son, I'll be fine
When I'm dead and gone, Heaven call me home
Damn sure Georgia will
