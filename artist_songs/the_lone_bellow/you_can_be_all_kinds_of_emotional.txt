Letters written in vain
I don't care if you know
Pour my tear down a drain
Let 'em seep in slow

Oh, and we can dance around what happened
Play the music soft and low
And you can be all kinds of emotional

Drive a car to your town
Twenty hours down south
Tractor trailers in the snow
Highwaymen up loud

Oh, and I'm a man of constant sorrow
Let the night come soft and low
And you can be all kinds of emotional

Take my ache and take my blood
Take the time to wish me luck
Take my ache and take my blood
Take the time to wish me luck
Wish I was gone, wish I was dust
Wish I was gone, wish I was dust

On the porch to your house
With this letter in hand
All your candles burned out
Oh my good man
I watch you dance around in circles
With your new man in the glow
And you can be all kinds of emotional
And you can be all kinds of emotional
