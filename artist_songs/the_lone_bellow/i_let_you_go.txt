I let you go
and hoped you'd come back
Hoped you'd come back to me
Oh I let you go
and hoped you'd come back
Hoped you'd come back to me

I let you go
and hoped you'd come back
Hoped you'd come back to me
Oh I let you go
and hoped you'd come back
Hoped you'd come back to me

Cause leaving ain't as easy as it used to be
You wear my heart on your sleeve

Oh I let you go
Hoped you'd come back to me
Letters that I write
you won't find you lonely
Won't find you thinking about me
Oh I let you go
and hoped you'd come to me
