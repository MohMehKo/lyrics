And you told me you were sorry and you did not want to pray
You looked outside your window as I went outside and waved
The street, it was much warmer on my bare feet than the rain
That fell out of the sky just like my thoughts fell from that day
Oh...

I poured out one more hand full of the rain that fell that day
I collected in my spare time as I walked back home that May
On the night you said you're sorry, on the night my colors changed
I waved to you from outside as you screamed of all my shame

I'll never leave, I'll always stay, I swear on all that I keep safe
I'll never leave, I'll always stay, I swear on all that I keep safe

A tree I'll grow to let you know my love is older than my soul
A tree I'll grow to let you know my love is older than my soul
A tree I'll grow to let you know my love is older than my soul
A tree I'll grow to let you know my love is older than my soul

Brutal smile, your well-known face, your tapping shoes, your wicked grace
Your precious time, your darker days, the days I left you with no space
To breathe or even think of me without the worry that I'd always leave
I'll never leave, I'll always stay, I swear on all that I keep safe
I'll never leave, I'll always stay, I swear on all that I keep safe
I'll never leave, I'll always stay, I swear on all that I keep safe
I'll never leave, I'll always stay, I swear on all that I keep safe
I'll never leave, I'll always stay, I swear, I swear, I swear, I swear

But it gets harder and harder
But my love is older than my soul
But my love is older than my soul

But it gets harder and harder
But my love is older than my soul
But my love is older than my soul

A tree I'll grow to let you know my love is older than my soul
A tree I'll grow to let you know my love is older than my soul
A tree I'll grow to let you know my love is older than my soul
A tree I'll grow to let you know my love is older than my soul
