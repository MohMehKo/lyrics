Green eyes and a heart of gold, all our
Money's gone and the house is cold
And it's alright, it's alright,
It's alright, it's alright
[x2]

You wear your faded old dress
The night of the fourth of July
The darkness kept your silhouette
When light flashed 'cross the sky
One crash at a time, oh
One crash at a time, yeah

Green eyes and a heart of gold, all our
Money's gone and the house is cold
And it's alright, it's alright,
It's alright, it's alright
[x2]

We're broke in New York City
The F train takes us home
Our wide-eyed ways may look like
A wreck where we're from

It's harder than we thought it'd be
We're losing blood with every beat
Our song is not a dying dream
You're not alone, you're not alone

Green eyes and a heart of gold, all our
Money's gone and the house is cold
And it's alright, it's alright,
It's alright, it's alright
[x2]

For one crash at a time

Green eyes and a heart of gold, all our
Money's gone and the house is cold
And it's alright, it's alright,
It's alright, it's alright
[x2]

You wear your faded old dress
The night of the fourth of July
Your face I only saw
When the fireworks crash

We're broke in New York City
The F train takes us home
Our wide-eyed ways may look like
A wreck where we're from

Green eyes and a heart of gold, all our
Money's gone and the house is cold
And it's alright, it's alright,
It's alright, it's alright
[x2]
