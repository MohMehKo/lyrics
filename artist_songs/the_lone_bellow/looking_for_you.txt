Your breakdown was easy to see
It took you away, further from me
Sifting through mishaps and photographs
I think of you much more than I should
More than I should

And I'm falling down
Like it's holy ground
I'm looking for you again
I'm looking for you again

Slow regrets that live in the dark
I've written them down, but
I know them by heart
I've counted the cost of this loneliness
I've paid for the crime and someday I'll die
With you in my mind

And I'm falling down
Like it's holy ground
I'm looking for you again
I'm looking for you again

I'm not letting you go again
Not letting this story end
I'm not letting you go again
Not letting this story end

Oh, I'm not letting you go again
I'm not letting this story end
Oh, I'm not letting you go again
I'm not letting this story end

And I'm falling down
Like it's holy ground
I'm looking for you again
I'm looking for you again

And I can't go without
And there's always doubt
I'm looking for you again
I'm looking for you again
