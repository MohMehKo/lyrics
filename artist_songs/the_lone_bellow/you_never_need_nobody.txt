You never need nobody
You've never been alone
And I try to get your affection
And all I ever do is wrong

You could break a heart in your sleep
Yeah the way you move makes a grown man weak
They all line up at your door
Saying, "Please (please), please (please)
I can't take no more."

You never need nobody
You've never been alone
I try to get your affection
And all I ever do is wrong

You could calm a storm with your tone
Yeah the way you sing makes a mockingbird hum
The grass you walk on gives way
Saying, "Please (please), please (please)
Come back this way."

You never need nobody
You've never been alone
I try to get your affection
And all I ever do is wrong

Give me your hardest fever
Loudest scream in the crowd
All of these good times
Can't change the way I
Feel 'bout you now

Give me your hardest fever
Loudest scream in the crowd
All of these good times
Can't change the way I
Feel 'bout you now

Now I know you've got that smile
And the way it shines can drive a man half wild
I won't dance around this no more
I'm the only one you should smile for, yeah.

You never need nobody
You've never been alone
And I try to get your affection
And all I ever do is wrong

You never need nobody
You've never been alone
I try to get your affection
And all I ever do is wrong
