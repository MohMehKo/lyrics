I know something
You're no liar
You're the beauty I admire
Burning love, hope, and desire
You're the woods at night on fire

Oh I miss you when it's cold out
Church bells ring I hear you sing out
An old broken record turning
You're a wild melody

I know I might not be he one you take

Take my love
Take my love

When you told me you can't sleep
Count your sins instead of sheep
Count the ways that you feel weak
But that is not what I see

You're no wreckage, you're a fire
Straight the sky by your own power
Sounding loud above the water
You're a wild melody

I know I might not be the one you take
I've got a heart that may not fade away

Take my love
Take my love
Take my love

Reach the windows, I see him
Has your bed gone up in flames?
Hear that roof cry as it caves
Of its power on your face

No one's had you hide before
Felt that breathing on your floor
Felt that move at your front door
Felt that blood inside you boil

(Take my love)
You're no sunset
You're no liar
You're the beauty I admire
(Take my love)
You're the woods at night on fire
Burning love, hope, and desire
(Take my love)
Girl I miss you when it's cold out
Church bells ring I hear you sing out
(Take my love)
You're a broken record turning
You're a wild melody

Take my love
Take my love
Take my love
Take my love
