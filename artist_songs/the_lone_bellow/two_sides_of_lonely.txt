I had one chance to tell you I was worth it
As we stood between the graves in our town
And the dead folks sang their forgotten songs
As I watched your eyes stare at the ground

On the one hand, you're hoping I'm lying
On the other, you hope I'm a fool
And the wind, it blew all the leaves around you
As you watched all our dreaming come true

Two sides of lonely
One is heart
One is duty

Two sides of lonely
One's in the grave
And the other should be

We were alone together in Brooklyn
And the midnight snow fell in the park
And the wind, it crashed through the trees above us
As we watched the frost freeze our dead hearts

Two sides of lonely
One is heart
One is duty

Two sides of lonely
One's in the grave
And the other should be

And the dead folks they hum
All the songs that you sung
In the grave you dug yourself
When we were young

And the dead folks they sway
Back and forth to the drum

Two sides of lonely
Laid to rest in their arms

You rock back and forth as the seasons
Change just like your open mind in the dark
And the nights you sleep, you dream of me
And the love you let die.
