You were golden, filled with power
Steps you took they settled fire
You were leaving, losing something
Taking in your downward spiral

I would watch you in the moonlight
Softly stepping towards the midnight
Through the wet dress to the woods
Far behind you where I stood

House of cards
Stacked with care
That's fallen
Time the thief of all 
that's good has gone
Oooooooh

There you saw me barely breathing
Hear you say, I'm finally leaving
You were golden, filled with power
Walking toward your final hour
