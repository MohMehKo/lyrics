Fallen embers from a flamin' rose
Keep my heart and take it where you go
You never came close, a million miles from my soul
So just move along, move along

If you don't love me, if you don't love me
Leave me and let me go
Leave me and let me go

Fallen embers from a flamin' sky
Spinnin' red, make a way out into the night
I could be out in the daytime huntin' out a passerby
When you're howlin' at the moon, howlin' at the moon

If you don't love me, if you don't love me
If you don't love me, if you don't love me
Leave me and let me go
Leave me and let me go

Can you tell me how a heart can move on
Can you break what binds me, whatever it was
From the lifeless ashes, what we've become
Can you tell me, tell me, tell me

If you don't love me, if you don't love me
If you don't love me, if you don't love me
Leave me and let me go
Leave me and let me go
