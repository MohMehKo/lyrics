Tables prepared in streets of gold
You've bared your tears from starry stone
The stage is set so we can fly
But suns will set and hearts are wild

'Til the southern wind puts me 6 feet down
My feet won't rest 'til my love is found

Remember when the mountains fell
Like pennies down a wishing well?
Wish another day would come
When I would watch 'em far from home

'Til the southern wind puts me 6 feet down
My feet will march on holy ground

Our laborin' may end in pain
While we walk the fields of the same
When called to war from trumpets tall
Love will see the army's fall
When called to war from trumpets tall
Love will see the army's fall
