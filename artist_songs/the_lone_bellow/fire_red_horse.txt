The fire red horse
That could not be tamed
He could not be broken
My uncle's red flame
His neck, it was wounded
His breathing was sparse
His bondages, bloody
My uncle's old heart

The two would go walking
They both knew their part
The both of them healing
Walk deep in the dark
My uncle was wild
The red horse grew strong
I watched from the dirt road
While you climbed on

Go ride through the night
You're broken inside
And you're not alright
And oh, the strong red horse and I'm by your side
And oh, the strong red horse
And I'm by your side

The fire red horse
You broken, strong man
Fight off all the demons
With just your bare hands
I wait for you patiently
Back at the barn
The sweet smell of horse feed
I sleep in the straw

And the wind it would roar
And the rain it would fall
And the fire red horse
And you would go walk

Go ride through the night
You're broken inside
Go ride through the night
You're broken inside
And you're not alright
And oh, the strong red horse and I'm by your side
And oh, the strong red horse
And I'm by your side
