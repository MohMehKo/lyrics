Baby I'm not stupid 
And you know I'm not dumb 
I only make mistakes cuz I'm so stupidly in love 
I love the way you kiss me 
How your lips keep me sprung 
You are my addiction my sweet drug 
I just can't have enough 

[Pre-Chorus:]
You're the one who understand me most 
You're the jam baby I'm the toast 
You and I, when we're side by side, 
Going close n tight, we're sweet 
I love the touch of your skin so smooth 
You and I connect like Bluetooth 
Girl your eyes can make ma body all weak 

[Chorus:]
And ma heartbeat goes like Dadam [x5]
Every time girl that you whisper in ma ear 
that we are in love 
Girl you make ma heart go Dadam [x5]
When your smile brighten up ma day giving me your warmth 
Like the morning sun 
And my heartbeat goes like 

A lil bit slower, and just a lil bit fast 
Those eyes can take away my stress 
or forget my past 
Just how the way make me 
Miss you much all day long 
It's like my life ain't complete girl without you 
My world ain't whole 

[Repeat Pre-Chorus & Chorus]

[Bridge:]
(And my heart beat goes) 
So slowly when I'm touched by an angel 
That fills my whole world with her smiles 
You blessed me with a love so special 
Like Iâ€™m in the heaven tonight (tonight)
