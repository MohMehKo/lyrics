Feel this chemistry this is where I wanna be 
Under the covers undressing you on top of me 

This ain't right 
But just one night 
Cuz one lie can make you mine 
You got no shame 
That's your game 
Undress now let's begin 

Innocent like a doe 
No one would doubt for sure 
This mere veneer it ain't real but just for show 
Gorgeous from head to toe 
Hotter than all dem whores 
She bring the heat up on the bed until the break of dawn 

She ain't the saint or the angel she looks like 
She prey on men like a wolf in the moonlight 
Burn it up with desire 
Damn she's hot like fire 
Under the covers she she she moves like a 

Freak in the bed, uh
Freak in the bed, uh
Freak in the bed, uh
Freak in the bed
She's like a freak in the bed, uh

Freak in the bed, uh
Freak in the bed, uh

Hit the blinds, shorty jump on me tonight 
Grab her thighs, bring her body close to mine 

I get it in 
Deeper in it 
We bring the heat up
She feelin' it 
Now she says oh 
She wants more 
Level up and dig in 

Innocent like a doe 
No one would doubt for sure 
This mere veneer it ain't real but just for show 
Gorgeous from head to toe 
Hotter than all dem whores 
She bring the heat up on the bed until the break of dawn 

She ain't the saint or the angel she looks like 
She prey on men like a wolf in the moonlight 
Burn it up with desire 
Damn she's hot like fire 
Under the covers she she she moves like a 

Freak in the bed, uh

Live when the Moon up set the sky 
Bright coz she Luna. Dance at night

but for the radio's sake I meant...  
mosquito bites. yeah I said you be-itch

Unauthorized Saint outta Vatican

behind ya head. call my name

hottest style its Yoga Flame 
Body language with an accent 
ask em when she passin by 
they passin out and gaspin' air 
walkin' open legs with broken asset 
like creative diff
