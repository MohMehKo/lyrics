I'm not really proud about what I did or didn't do
Coz I can even justify all this pain I'm gonna put you through
Last night you are out with friends
I was working late like there was no end
You though I was lying to you
Hang up the phone on me and stay

Coz every time we had a fight, we talked it over and we were fine
But I guess this time we gotta let it all go
But baby I tried so many times, to talk to you on the phone last night
But some other guy said hello when I called

What would you do?
If tables were turned around and you were to be in my shoes
What would you say?
Would you give in to lust or would you just let your love slip away
Maybe I was afraid that I will end up hurt
Took the wrong way until the point of no return
What would you do?
When you look around you’re all alone coz all the right went wrong

Midnight was crawling in; she was the only one who cared for me
It started with a bottle of wine, I was letting go off my pain out free
I know that I’m not perfect
I was just the man any man would be 
When she was looking so damn fine, temptations were calling me

Driving her back home last night, I was trying to thank her and say goodbye
One thing lead to another before we know
But baby I tried so many times, to talk to you on the phone last night
But some other guy said hello when I called

I didn’t think that I will be the one to first hurt you
I messed it up and I don’t really think I deserve you
I know I was wrong but I thought I was stronger
But I guess it’s now too late
Just tell me the truth, if you were in my shoes, what would you do baby?

What would you do?
If tables were turned around and you were to be in my shoes
What would you say?
Would you give in to lust or would you let your true love slip away
May be I was afraid that I will end up hurt
Took the wrong way until the point of no return
What would you do?
When you look around you’re all alone coz all the right went wrong
