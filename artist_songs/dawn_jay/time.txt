[Verse 1:]
Time, girl you look so captivating
I can barely see’ny signs of your wear
Time, it’s been so long I have been waiting
Girl I still I have those few strands of your hair
Time, I was wrong I thought I had it
Though I waited girl you show me no care
Time, it’s been so lonely I can’t help it
Girl I swear I still can feel you right there

[Pre-chorus:]
Coz I’m not half the man that I once used to be
It’s been years now since you left me here

[Chorus:]
It’s been so long since 2003
Everybody’s words filled with pleasantry
I got my world filled with fantasies
Lost it all when girl you tripped out on me
I lost you to the time….time…
Blame it all on time… time…

[Verse 2:]
Time, now it’s time I realize that all this
Dreams I’ve seen all night ain’t for real
Time, but I can’t understand why
Girl you left my love behind loving him
Time, I’ve been trying to be dating
I’ve been weighing all ‘em girls in your scale
Time, I’ve been lying to myself just by denying
Replacing you I have failed

[Pre-Chorus:]
Coz I’m not half the man that I once used to be
It’s been years now since you left me here

[Chorus:]
It’s been so long since 2003
Everybody’s words filled with pleasantry
I got my world filled with fantasies
Lost it all when girl you tripped out on me
I lost you to the time….time…
Blame it all on time… time…

[Bridge:]
So many words I could say to just to stop you from leaving
We were so close more than friends but it was you who left me
No more tears no more cry-ing
That’s what you promised but promised not there
No more fears of your lies
But it all happened in 2003

[Chorus:]
It’s been so long since 2003
Everybody’s words filled with pleasantry
I got my world filled with fantasies
Lost it all when girl you tripped out on me
I lost you to the time….time…
Blame it all on time… time…

I lost you to the time….time…
Blame it all on time… time…
