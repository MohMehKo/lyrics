She got big cannons on her chest 
She's fucking gorgeous I confess 
And when she pass by everyone goes WOW! 
She brings a girl home every night 
She looks at me with flirty eyes 
I'ma work it for menage-a-trois 

[Pre-Chorus:]
She's Michael Jackson Bad 
Up in ma bachelor pad 
No doubt the best I had 
(Shorty got a booty like booty of a real whore)
She grinding with her friend 
Contest of the best to give head 
Them girls go wild on ma bed 
(Shorty got a booty like booty of a real whore)

[Chorus:]
She's so bad 
Make love to a different girl like a Nomad 
She's so bad 
I know she wants me with her girl friend 
So bad so bad yeah So bad so bad 
I'ma get both of them girls now 
So bad so bad yeah So bad so bad 
I'ma work it for menage-a-trois 

Drink up champagne and get to bed 
Strip down them clothes and get naked 
Ride this tricycle I'ma get you to the top 
Both them hot girls go wild insane 
Make me play harder in ma game 
I'ma put another three point shot 

[Repeat Pre-Chorus & Chorus:]

[Rap: Monkey King]
I treat sex like war, on guard fight on, 
a knight in rubber armor, turn the lights off 
The bed is my fort as I say bonsoir 
un, deux, trois off come all bras 
pardon moi as I'm entering in 
got u on film call me edison chen 
keep it wet, n moving after the party 
kimochi kimochi and then oyasumi 

[Repeat Chorus]
