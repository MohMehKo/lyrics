Rain drops keep falling 
Like tears in my eyes 
Your lies keep on haunting 
My dreams through the night 
Those nightmares keep creeping 
of you sleeping behind 
my back with another guy 

I can't really imagine 
How could this be true 
We've been with each other 
not one year but two 
Surrendered my soul and my life 
at your shoes 
Coz' I loved you so true 

[Pre chorus:]
You played with two lives 
played with mine and with his 
You said you'll be mine but you lied with a kiss 
Won't hate but no love coz your love's like abyss 

[Chorus:]
I ain't gonna fall there no more 
I ain't gonna fall for you for sure 
You're an angel with pitch fork and horns 
I ain't gonna love you no more 

They keep on telling 
You ain't worth the pain 
All this time till today 
You've been playing a game 
I am just confused and lost 
If I should love you or hate 
I know it's never gonna be the same 

[Repeat pre-chorus & chorus]
