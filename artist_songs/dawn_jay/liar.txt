[Verse 1:]
I was trying to find a reason
To tell you that I'm sorry
I've been lying all this while
So that you never worry
Baby, meeting friends or working late
It was just a story
Girl I lied, made you cry

[Pre Chorus:]
I said my car ran outta gas I had to
Walk till I was late
No reception on the phone tried to
Call but had no change
Baby, I never meant to lie to you
But the truth was hard to face
Girl I tried not to lie

[Chorus:]
You can call me liar (liar)
I was too weak to face the truth
You can call me liar (liar)
I couldn't tell you I'll leave you soon
Girl I had my reasons believe me
I never wanted to see that you cry
You can call me liar (liar)
I really love you that's why I lied

You can call me liar (liar) [3x]
I really love you that's why I lied

[Verse 2:]
She cut the call when she was on ma phone
When you picked up the line
You got so mad and asked me who's the girl
I'm sleeping with behind
Baby, I had no words to say
So I guess I will try
Not to lie... it's the time...

[Pre Chorus:]
I said my car ran outta gas I had to
Walk till I was late
No reception on the phone tried to
Call but had no change
Baby, I never meant to lie to you
But the truth was hard to face
Girl I tried not to lie

[Bridge:]
Girl I never tried to cheat and lie
But I guess I had no choice
Now I guess it's time to say goodbye
So baby hear my voice

[Chorus 2:]
I was with my doctor all this time
When I came home late
She said ma brain is dying (dying)
I only got four months to wait
Girl I had my reasons believe me
I never wanna see that you cry
You can call me liar (liar)
I really love you that's why I lied

You can call me liar (liar) [3x]
I really love you that's why I lied
