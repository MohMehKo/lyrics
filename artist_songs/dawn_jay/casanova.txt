[Chorus:]
Shawty I'm a love machine 
You can call me Casanova 
Baby girl I dig in deep 
Feel it when I dip it slower 
Turn down the light off 
Cuz I'ma turn you on 
And you'll be screaming scratching yelling like you want it more 
You gonna scream Oh 
You want it more 
cuz u know that I'm the one to play the game 
until the break of dawn 
Screaming ma name say 'Dawn'
Girl we'll be making love 
Baby say ma name 

I met her in the club 
She said "hey boy wazzup"
Throwing down vodka shots 
On the rocks bottoms up 
Then she lean on to me 
"Baby bring me to your crib"
I could not resist cuz 
The taste of her tongue is so sweet 

Up on ma bed 
We're going wild making love 
It's still midnight let's do it again 
I need no breaks 
Just bring your body up and down 

[Repeat Chorus]

You know I never sell out when it comes to writing raps,
I never ink a piece of paper just to filling up a track,
Never Waste another music,
Never Write no porno flicks,
But if you talking bout a girl there's no no other but my chick,
See she's my bad girl,
Bad chick,
slur it how you want it,
Blur your vision don't squint just close em while you at it,
my beats bang hard way harder never over,
Makes your chicks all wet my bad casanova

[Bridge:]
Purring like a kitty cat 
Scratching as she hugs ma back 
Legs keep trembling she's weak she can't hold it back 
With a loud 'Oh!!'
She call ma name "Dawn" 
Pop! like a champagne bottle let it flow

[Repeat Chorus]
