[Verse 1:]
Baby it's the time of the Valentines 
That I'll be searching for the gift 
To tell ya how much I love you 
Saving every penny working overtime 
After working like a slave from eight to five 

[Verse 2:]
Girl I've been searching for a ring to tell ma love's forever 
But the money in ma pocket doesn't match the price 
Cuz baby if I buy a ring I need a diamond in it 
So to match beauty and the shine in your eyes 

[Pre-Chorus:]
So baby if I fail to find the perfect gift to give 
You should know that I tried real hard to make you feel special 
I hope you know that baby 

[Chorus:]
You, You're the one, the one that love 
The love that so greater than the valuable things 
No gift that I can bring' chocs or diamond rings, 
Can match up to the beauty or the joy that you bring 
Cuz girl you're perfect than the perfect 
I can buy you gifts but it ain't worth it 
So let me write this song, when my thoughts hit the chords 
It's my Valentine gift for you 
For you, for you for you 
It's my Valentine gift for you 

[Verse 3:]
I even tried to find the best perfume for you 
But there's nothing in the world so sweet as you 
I even got some roses but the roses can't beat you 
Cuz when you smile the world's finest rose is you

[Repeat Pre-Chorus & Chorus]
