[Verse1 :]
It's been a while since I last
saw you girl
it's been a while since we've
been in our own world
It ain't the same since you left
me here alone girl
it's been a while since you'd left

[Pre-chorus:]
we were chillin' with our friends
next to me, you were holdin' me
now I'm chillin' with my friends
memories keep on haunting me
Why you have to go
Girl Why you have to go

[Chorus:]
If it takes one last kiss
to make it alright
If it takes one last kiss
to get you here tonight
gotta let it go
let it go, let it go
no no no no

If it takes one last chance
to help ease that fight
If it takes one last chance
to get you here tonight
shouldnt let it go
let it go, let it go
no no no no

[Verse 2:]
You left your toothbrush in my bathroom but still
I aint throwin' it
Can't bear to see your pictures in my room so
I ain't going in
And I left you a thousand n more sms on the phone 
No answering
Baby Girl I just keep on trying

[Repeat Pre-chorus & Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Just like the sun
you shone bright in my sky
When the clouds of doubt
put a veil across your light
Now I hate this, darkness, need your sunshine in my life

[Repeat Chorus]
