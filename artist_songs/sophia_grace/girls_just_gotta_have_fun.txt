And if you're listening to the radio right now

Hey girls, we gotta go on green light
Want to get to the mall, they got them jeans I like
And I see some cute kicks I wanna wear tonight
I got my glam on chick, oh yeah
EE-O, EE-O, EE-O
Back up to the crib we go
We so stupid fresh, it's something like a fashion show
We're going off like a bomb
Everybody know it's on, somebody ring the alarm, yeah

Doesn't matter where we're gonna be at
Cause the parties gonna follow me here
So mister DJ, let the music play
We're gonna have a good ti-i-ime

Girls just gotta have

Hope your breaking that, cause your girl Sophia's here
Hands in the air, put them where you wanna hear
Time to rock it real hard, oh yeah
Oh boy, Oh boy
I'm dancing with my girls
Please don't get your feelings hurt cause you might get your turn
We don't care just don't win us
Tonight we don't care
We're gonna do it up

Doesn't matter where we're gonna be at
Cause the party's gonna follow me here
So mister DJ, let the music play

Your all invited
Put your pink tutus on, it's so exciting
It's the princess swagger, moves like jagger

Haters gonna hate
And they're go chit, chit chatter
I'm Sophia Grace, I got that super bass
And I've been flying in a rocket in and out of space
Nicki is my princess, and Ellen is my queen
P-put them all together that's the Hollywood dream
I'm sipping on the milkshake
Strawberries and cream
Rosie got my back and that's my princess team
We're flying to the top
We're never gonna stop
The sky is the limit, and this princess rocks, woo!

Girls just gotta have
Girls just gotta have
Girls just gotta have fun, fun
Ooooh (hey hey hey)
Girls just gotta have fun

Girls just gotta have

Everywhere we go you already know that
