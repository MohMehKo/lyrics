Hey oh, wherever I go
I will always call it home
It's your UK girl, Sophia Grace
Let's go

What up, you know where I've been
Looking at the time so they call me Big Ben
Click click, calling all my friends
We gon' live it up from the Tower to the Thames

Yeah that's me, all day long
Running through the city with my headphones on
Yeah that's me, all day long
Like what (like what) and you know

No matter where in the world you are
(Where you at, where you at)
Home is always where you keep your heart
(It's where I'm at, where I'm at)

Hey oh, wherever I go
I will always call it home
Everyday till forever
Wear it proud like a sweater
Hey oh, wherever I go
London Bridge to Tokyo
Everyday it gets better
Know I'll never forget ya, oh oh

Cause I'm always gonna be, always gonna be
Be a UK girl
Cause I'm always gonna be, always gonna be
Be a UK girl

Hands up, prettiest in pink
Crown up on my head, but this girl don't need a king
I'm a princess, you know I'm royalty
I'll be making moves like my name Annabelle
Yeah that's me, all day long
Running through the city with my headphones on
Yeah that's me, all day long
Like what (like what) and you know

No matter where in the world you are
(Where you at, where you at)
Home is always where you keep your heart
(It's where I'm at, where I'm at)

Hey oh, wherever I go
I will always call it home
Everyday till forever
Wear it proud like a sweater
Hey oh, wherever I go
London Bridge to Tokyo
Everyday it gets better
Know I'll never forget ya, oh oh

Cause I'm always gonna be, always gonna be
Be a UK girl
Cause I'm always gonna be, always gonna be
Be a UK girl
