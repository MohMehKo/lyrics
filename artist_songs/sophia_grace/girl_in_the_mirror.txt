I wake up every day like "Hello, beautiful."
'Cause this world is so crazy and it can bring you down
You're too short, too fat, too skinny

Hey, well, excuse me if I think that I'm pretty

So I don't care what you say 'cause I'm original
I'm learning how to love me from my head down to my toes
Let 'em know, let 'em know if you with me
Hey, 'cause I finally found the answer is in me

Whoa! My mama, she did say
Don't you let 'em get you down
How to learn to love me

That's why I'm talking to the girl in the mirror, whoa, oh
Like even if you're down, better get up, whoa, oh
'Cause every setback's just a set up, whoa, oh
For something just a little bit better
Oh, I'm talking to the girl in the mirror
Girl in the mirror
Girl in the mirror, girl in the mirror
Girl in the mirror, girl in the mirror

Go to sleep at night with a smile on my face
'Cause I know who I am and I can't ever be replaced
So go ahead, be proud, be different
Hey, that's what makes you one out of a million

Whoa, my mama, she did say
Don't you let 'em get you down
How to learn to love me

That's why I'm talking to the girl in the mirror, whoa, oh
Like even if you're down, better get up, whoa, oh
'Cause every setback's just a set up, whoa, oh
For something just a little bit better
Oh, I'm talking to the girl in the mirror
Girl in the mirror
Girl in the mirror, girl in the mirror
Girl in the mirror, girl in the mirror

That's why I'm talking to the girl in the mirror, whoa, oh
Like even if you're down, better get up, whoa, oh
'Cause every setback's just a set up, whoa, oh
For something just a little bit better
Oh, I'm talking to the girl in the mirror
Girl in the mirror
Girl in the mirror, girl in the mirror
Girl in the mirror, girl in the mirror
