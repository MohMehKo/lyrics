I can be the girl I always wanted
Hollywood let's get it started
Tra-tra-traffic, stoppin', when I'm, walkin'

There's mansions in our heels, cars bouncing on two wheels
D-d-downtown, turn up, pictures, insta

See a little this, see a little that (that)
Buy a little this, buy a little that (that)
Gimme gimme this, gimme gimme that (that)
Buy a little this, buy a little that (that)

I'm feeling good, so Hollywood
Go Hollywood crazy
Red carpet, Imma rock it
For the paparazzi
Only in Cali where the stars come out at night
Seeing fast cars, on the boulevard
I'm Hollywood crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I'm Hollywood crazy

Got all my girls beside me, where the sun is always shining
Tra-tra-traffic, stoppin', when I'm, walkin'
I'm here and I'm never leaving
I'm Cali all four seasons
Pa-pa-parties, shoppin', new clothes rockin'

See a little this, see a little that (that)
Buy a little this, buy a little that (that)
Gimme gimme this, gimme gimme that (that)
Buy a little this, buy a little that (that)

I'm feeling good, so Hollywood
Go Hollywood crazy
Red carpet, Imma rock it
For the paparazzi
Only in Cali where the stars come out at night
Seeing fast cars, on the boulevard
I'm Hollywood crazy

I'm feeling so good, I'm feeling Hollywood
I'm droppin' a beat, strummin' a bass to make you feel good
I switch lanes, I change the game, I'm Sophia who?
You know my name
Da Beat Freakz (Beat Freakz), they on the track
And if you're in the club, DJ bring it back
Put your Starbucks up in the air
We on Sunset Boulevard, we don't care (yeah)

I'm feeling good, so Hollywood
Go Hollywood crazy
Red carpet, Imma rock it
For the paparazzi
Only in Cali where the stars come out at night
Seeing fast cars, on the boulevard
I'm Hollywood crazy
(I-I-I-I-I'm Hollywood crazy, crazy, I'm-I'm Hollywood crazy, crazy)
