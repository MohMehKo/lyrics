So pay attention, babe
Pay attention
Our Father, who art in Heaven
Quik gave me a beat, now Pomona's on the set, now...

[Chorus:]
Get your money, why you bullshittin'?!
Baby, why you bullshittin'?!

Mama tries but there ain't no love like homie love, baby
I'm G'd up and I'm crazy
And there's a mellow ghetto breeze on my ass
Cause I'm, saggin', don't wanna die so I'm taggin'
Now when I see my baby cryin'
I can't explain how it hits me
I'm tryin' papers while she fill it in
Ya see in order for me to win, I gotta lose sometimes, baby
I know I'm wrong but I'm a make it
Now I...

Never hit hit a woman, naha
But I slapped the shit out of a bitch, why you bullshittin'?!
If you think a little ahead, you gets a little ahead, little trick
But I ain't goin' against the grain, not me, not even a little bit
Bet she didn't tell you she used to be my ho, huh?
Yeah nigga, she sold that pussy for me, in Pomona
You better take some of this night time sticky icky head
'Fore she could realise I'm tryin' to get rich with Quik
Why you bullshittin'?
Suga Free is lovely and pretty as I can be
Perms simpler than Charlotte Spred, waves deep as Redonda Beach
Tellin' you to

[Chorus:]
Get your money, why you bullshittin'?!
Baby, why you bullshittin'?!
I get down, why you bullshittin'?!
Baby, why you bullshittin'?!

Now what's the problem nigga?
Whu-what? Yo' lady won't suck your dick?
Cause for the very low low price of $100 you can use my bitch
And if you act now, man, I'll throw in a ho that'll buff your nad
She used to work down there at the Sperm Bank
See, she got fired for drinkin' on the job
But you ain't know, givin' baby yo' money, be killin' me!
Lettin' that bitch disrespect you in front of yo' friends be killin me!
Always givin' that bitch some dick, killin' me
Goin' through one ear, comin' out the other,
Talkin bout you feelin' me
Now, partner tell me where my love at
Cause I'm a tell you where you're wrong at
I'll be in but I won't break, not me, no matter
If I'm broker than her, I won't take her purse
I just want the whole [?]
Shit! And at that you broke, been broke, gon' be broke
Wanna see me broke, but please ho, really doe
Cause I, tell a lie? She tell a lie
Sit there with a straight face [?] on one anothers lives
Now I can tell you 30 times how to pimp you a ho
And I can tell you 30 mo' and you still won't know
Partner, you wanna overuse the pussy?
Me, I'm tryin' to hit the news with the pussy
In a survey it's estimated that 9 out of 10 men don't check they spouse but Suga Free'll tell your pretty ass to get the fuck out!

[Chorus:]
And get my money, why you bullshittin'?!
Baby, why you bullshittin'?!
I get down, why you bullshittin'?!
Baby, why you bullshittin'?!

Bitch come get yo' damn kid, you see him tearin' up my shit?
She's starin' dead at they ass, you won't tell 'em to quit
Now, I whoop they ass, fuck waitin' 'till baby turn her back
Lil ol' man come sock me, trust me
He tryin' to run, he gettin' cracked
I want you but I really don't need you, bitch
Cause all you do is eat, burp and fuck and talk that shit
And tell yo' kids I ain't they motherfuckin' daddy
What-what? Yo' medi couch fly?
Cause they look like they been eatin' cabbage
And it don't cost a dime
I won't knock one pork chop off yo' plate
If you don't knock one of mine, [?]
Cause a hoes gonna be a ho for real
Quit jockin' her cause youse a snack, she lookin' for a meal
And I ain't tryin' to be your friend bitch
Buddy, buddy, that's my partner, that nigga cool, and all that shit
Sayin: I won't be afraid, I won't go astray
I'll play like I'm wake, I'll stay in my place
Please let me stay, I'll hold to my grave
So how you wanna handle this? Baby we'll dismantle this
And we blows you out like a candle trick
Hahahahahahaa
And we blows you out like a candle trick

[Chorus:]
Man, get your money, why you bullshittin'?!
Baby, why you bullshittin'?!
Believe me, I get down, why you bullshittin'?!
That's right, baby, why you bullshittin'?!
Don't fuck around, why you bullshittin'?!
Yo, Kingpin, why you bullshittin'?!
I think, Pomona Town, why you bullshittin'?!
Uhh! That's where I'm from, why you bullshittin'?!
Get your money, why you bullshittin'?!
Table for two, baby, why you bullshittin'?!
Uuh, trick, it ain't hard, why you bullshittin'?!
And you know what? Credit card, why you bullshittin'?!
Got my money baby, why you bullshittin'?!
Ahh, god damn, why you bullshittin'?!
Suga Free, I get down, why you bullshittin'?!
Suga Free, Black Tone, don't be bullshittin'!
Kingpin for life!
Ahhhh, I get down for life, oh
