[Verse 1]
Ok, baby you sayin that to say what?
Uh uh that's drama no, no,
U didn't pick that shit up from yo mama
Now I...ain't...fenna break nann finger nail
Goin oops upside yo head
Yea I love you, baby....but not like that
Yo love ain't never paid my bills or put no clothes on my back,
Wait, what do you see said the blind man
Who heard the deaf man said he saw Suga Free just dropped the bomb and it went Boo-Yah!!
Then, when I'm feelin them years 2025, feelings I move...in a real way 
Now, sometimes I like a nice, hot, proper, hairy....head full of sweat from sex
On the couch first... and when it start feelin good, you always stop and say "Mmm no more I'm hurtin".....
And them chi'ren...Baby got kids so bad they'll piss you to the highest level of pestivity runnin they mouth smellin' like urine
Don't hurt the pimpin' baby....
Oh what we don't know each other no more 
cuz instead of a girlfriend I'd rather have a ho,
Won't catch me holdin hands, kickin cans,
walkin a tight rope sayin she loves me, 
she loves me not, man....

[Chorus]
I can be on my way, on my way 
On....my way 

[Suga Free Talking]
I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
and nuthin' but the truth so help me god.....

[Chorus]

[Suga Free talking]
Because the name of the game is 
cop n' blow.....

[Chorus]

[Suga Free Talking]
This time don't leave nuthin' so don't have 
to come back home and get it....

[Chorus]

[Suga Free talking]
Yea I know that's you callin, hangin up, 
puttin 187 on the pager....

[Verse 2]
Wait, no who the hell you talkin to
always cryin 'bout what I do and don't do for you...now that's yo problem
Always bringin up the past
If I wasn't on parol, I woulda kicked yo ass
Cuz she lookin for a sucka in a, wrong place
She doesn't know it but a playa get, lonely
But that don't mean I have ask you phony, cuz all you got to offer is yo punanay....
Uh uh, nah what you got yo hands out in my face for....oh you doin too much, wronger than two left shoes, but you don't know,
And I got it (got it) out yo house
Cuz I be hungry and all you had was one
Potato with fringes growin' out of it,
I'm 24, right? But in dog years let me see
For every 1 human year that's 7 years for 
a dog follow me....
So 7 times 24, wait 7 times 4 is 28, 
carry the 2 alright, I got to figure out 168...
And it's shame that we can't do lunch,
Cuz you get all roud until I say baby,
don't get yo panties in a bunch,
And just like jolly rancher candy, the same way I peeled off that plastic wrapper, 
is the same I peeled off baby's panties....

[Chorus]

[Suga Free talking]
No, No give me them keys,
You leavin' in a cab today, baby.....

[Chorus]

[Suga Free talking]
No, No don't go lookin' up in that closet,
cuz u ain't got nuthin' up there....

[Chorus]

[Suga Free talking]
Yea, Don't be callin' my mama house 
Pesterin' everybody either.....

[Chorus]

[Suga Free talking]
Uh uh, nah I'll come see my son, mama
don't be poppin' up over here....

[Chorus]

[Suga Free talking]
Wait, wait take off that watch, that necklace, them rings....that belongs to her now....

[Chorus]

[Suga Free talking]
Oh and before you go, quit blowin'
up my pager 911 just to see what I'm doin'.....

[Chorus to fade]
