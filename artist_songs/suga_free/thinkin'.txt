[Intro]
Every little thing she does is magic...
Know why?
Cause she ain't a bitch

[Verse 1]
You see...
There was a black man, a white man, and a Chinese man and God was giving out hair
He said, "Black man, what kind of hair do you want?"
He said, "Just ball mine up and throw it here."
Don't nothing come to sleepers but dreams
And then you wake up with reality in the distance, spinning and thinning complaining
Don't do me...God
No damn favor
You hate me cause I pimp a prostitute
You think I'm playin' nigga, after you
Now here's a person, here's a place, here's a thing we can a game
Oh yeah, you're glasses before you enter cause me and you, we don't see the same thang
I dance low, low, low, lower, lower, lower
Hair flying bounce you notice
I ain't for play
No day
I mean every motherfucking word that I say
What's fly to me is that the real ones
Catch on, bring you up
Respect the game, look out for daddy and know to shut the fuck up

[Hook]
I'm driving
I'm thinking
Checking out my business you better believe me
Hoeing
Prostitution
Tell me patna what is yo' solution

[Verse 2]
Do what you say, say what you mean cause one thing leads to another
But I guarantee that understanding me
I'll prolly make you pop a plea to your brother
City lights, heavy traffic just makes my day
Cause when I send my ho to work she catching date after date
While you sitting there wanting to lay up
Look bitch, ain't you got something to do today [?] you playa hater
Can't wait to leave sometime like five days ago
When I left saying "Once a ho always a ho"
I got a mack attack, I got a Tac attack
I got a [?]
Turn to me, we got to move the P
We got round brown pimpin' Suga Free, ooh wee
[?]
When Tone set down his gat, stepped back and told this nigga [?]

[Hook]
I'm driving
I'm thinking
Tell me why or what do you believe in
Is it money?
Now, is it power?
Pimp I pimp I pimp hour by hour

[Verse 3]
My people built this motherfucker and I know my way around
You see the same ole' faces going up, coming down
And I still can't read
And you ask me if I'm qualified to give you motherfuckers just what y'all need
I got a problem cause I'm fresh out the penitentiary baby
And I admit I'm antisocial and it's driving me crazy
At least in prison there's a guard tower
For level ones, level twos and level threes hour after hour
So many memories of struggling with my band bro
'85 counting Miller, 2001 [?]
The inmates asked me how I catched this case
They couldn't believe that Suga Free was right there in they face
The whole yard told another yard before I left the R&R
I tried to make my bed but I was signing autographs hard
Homies giving me noodles and chips and shit
My bunkie Dee said, "Man I know you miss that nigga Quik."

[Hook]
I'm driving
Still thinking
I don't know why I'm doing so much drinking
But I like it
And I need it
Bitch you just don't believe in who you believing
I'm leaving
And you never invite your girlfriend
