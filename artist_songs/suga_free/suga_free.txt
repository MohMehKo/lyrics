Let's make believe you really like me (haha)
And let's play like you listen to me the first time I tell you somethin' and don't repeat myself twice
See, I don't have that kinda time to waste
I fuck around and be an old ass man before I get my taste

I see these niggas yellin at bitches so loud they voice go horse
Just for a couple hundred dollars wit' a uncomfortable course
Let's makebelieve you ain't so hardhead and play like you know
Like you ain't dumb, like you intellegent, my fantasy hoe

Bitch let's pretend nobody tellin' me you outta pocket and shit
Let's make believe I really love you and I need you, bitch
See, it'd be good to see you go to work on time yourself
Won't have to tell you what to do, like I tell everybody else
Do I really have to remind you about what time I eat?
Or have my towels and my underclothes when I shower baby?

Seem like the older I get, the more I look for perfection
I'm Suga Free, bitch, and I ain't scared of rejection, boy

Suga Free
When the dog's away, the cat gon' play, tell you that right now
Suga Free
Pimp can't pimp unless he pimp an' gon' be able to pimp his self
Suga Free
Keepin' my head above water
Suga Free
Makin' the wave when we can

Ok, let's pretend I don't worry about you nothin' when you turnin' them tricks
Like when you don't call and check in with me when I tell you, bitch
I ain't gonna lie, sometimes your attitude make me want to throw you on the couch,
Slap your ass, pull your hair, and stick my dick in your mouth (Hahaha)

Let's make believe your momma like me and she don't talk that shit
And that she believed you when you told her that your stepdaddy hit
And that he didn't tell you if you told your momma what happen', 
That he was killin' both of ya'll, yeah, I'm tellin you what's happenin'

Let's make believe that you didn't get molested by your own blood 
And that your momma didn't beat you and wasn't hooked on drugs
You may see people say 'how can she stand on the corner like that?'
They just don't know what you went through to make you walk that track

She feel love for a minute, satisfying a trick
But she can be colder than some cold, wherever cold can get!
Steve Vicious did the beat, Nemo hooked it up
I moved cain with the herb, now I'm fuckin' it up

Suga Free
When the dog's away, the cat gon' play, tell you that right now
Suga Free
Pimp can't pimp unless he pimp an' gon' be able to pimp his self
Suga Free
Keepin' my head above water
Suga Free
Makin' the wave when we can

Now, let's play like you really know me to where you can predict my every move
Like when I smoke, choke, and huck her over the track, and Mac, and get her to choose
You a good pimp? Then don't play if she stay and play... (Huh)
Nigga, I took my radio outta my car because it played

Let's act like we don't know the truth, doin' boyfriend/girlfriend stuff
Holdin' hands, kickin' cans, fuck some money an' stuff

Who cares if you be outta pocket staring at nigga's and shit?
Leave the house and don't come back until it's ten to six
You wanna control me like I'm nothin', can't think for myself?
I'm tellin you right now, bitch, you think I'm somebody else

Let's make believe I don't care about nothin' you do
You say you love me bitch, then give me some money
Shit, I love you too

This ain't no relationship where you stay in one spot too long
Cause she a hoe she gonna shift the spot if she hot too long
And nigga don't act like that shit don't hurt when she AWOL from the track
Old man say don't change the locks, cause she'll be back!

Suga Free
When the dog's away, the cat gon' play, tell you that right now
Suga Free
