Eh! Eh! Gonna! Eh! Eh!

Gonna clean my room
Gonna clean my room
Gonna get a broom and a va-vacuum
Gonna clean my room
Gonna clean my room
Gonna get a broom and a va-vacuum
Gonna clean my room
Gonna clean my room
Gonna get a broom and a va-vacuum
Gonna clean my room
Gonna clean my room
Gonna get a broom and a va-vacuum

Clean my room
Clean my room
Clean my clean my room
Clean clean my room
[Repeat]
Clean – clean – clean – gonna get a – gonna get

And I'm lying and I'm always trying to clean my room
Because I'm lying and I'm always trying to clean my room
And it never happens
And it never happens
And it never happens
And it never happens

And then my mom gets saddened
And then my mom gets saddened
And then she yell at me
And then I go to sleep

'Cause I'm never gonna clean my room
Gonna clean my room
Gonna get a broom and a va-vacuum
Gonna clean my room
Gonna clean my room
Gonna get a broom and a va-vacuum
Gonna clean my room
Gonna clean my room
Gonna get a broom and a va-vacuum
Gonna clean my room
Gonna clean my room

(Come and save us oh my god)

Gonna...

[Sickick:]
We don't like it clean, hands up if you like it dirty
I think I'll be living like this till I'm thirty
You silly big willy you really thought Lilly and m-me would clean up but clearly we're filthy, baby oh lord have mercy
We don't like it clean, hands up if you like it dirty
Sick on the beat, follow me you lookin' thirsty
You lookin' thirsty
You lookin' thirsty
Party with us some time
