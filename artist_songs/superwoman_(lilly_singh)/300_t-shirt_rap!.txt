Zoop, that's a rap and not the type when I'm done
This a whaddup t-shirt reference, 300 rap song
Imma kill it like a messenger who said somethin' wrong
'Cause I only serve people when I'm playing ping-pong

Don't trip, and tie those laces
'Cause if we talking about drive, I've got Gosling's faces
I'm next level, so come at me bro

Some people like money, me I like happy
F three million dollars, I've got a three million families
So you stack it up like a bankerman
I'll hold it down for team super like an anchorman

I still believe in one love, got my feet on the ground
And even with the crowds, don't got my head in the clouds
So just bring it, and come at me bro

I am the bae of Hercules, nobody's hurtin' me
I was born a unicorn
I am queen bee, so haters love me
Long hair, no care, I play footsies with Xerxes

This is unicorn island
Where we don't meow, we just roar like lions
Ride or die, so come at me bro

Act like a lady, think like a boss
Nah I'm just playin', it means the same thing
This lady is a boss, man I'm just sayin'
In fact, scratch that, man I'm super sayin'

I ain't tryin' to get married to some rich dude
I'm too busy eatin' veggie burgers 'cause I love food
It's fries before guys, not to be rude
Mama said marry a doctor, I'm like Doctor Who?

I'm a looney tune, that's the story of my life
Rather eat some ice-cream, than ya' call me f in' wife
Unless it's something they know, they know when they know
I'm all about that taco chip and that cookie, D'oh

I'm out of control, I'm a thug like that
Unicorns are lame? I ain't got time for that
Like #leh, come at me bro

Rules of racism and parents comparing kids
What Bollywood's taught me, with Madhuri Dixit
Types of people, laughs, farts and relatives
I've Hannah, Connor, King and Helbig

I'm feeling boss, feeling dope, feeling fly
I'm feeling hype, feeling super, feeling high
'Cause team super, team super you the best
You're so good that you take away my unicorn breath

This is the story all about how
My life got flipped, turned upside down
And this is the story all about how
Get down, get down and move it all around

Three, zero, zero, oh
One to the two to the three, oh, oh
Three to the four, here we go
