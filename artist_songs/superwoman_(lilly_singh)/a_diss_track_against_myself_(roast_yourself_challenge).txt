Wuddup everyone, its your girl superwoman
In the kitchen, a plate of roasted Lillies what I'm cooking
I'm a loud brown girl who's pretty ratchet looking
If it wasn't for diversity, I wouldn't get no bookings

And I play all of my characters because I have no friends
And I'm never looking sexy so my videos never trend
And when I wipe my beard off, there's always still a strip
Nah, that ain't no make up, I need to wax my upper lip

I shave in the morning, by lunch it grows back
Jump cuts in my edits, make up for what I lack
And I say that I'm a rapper but I only have two tracks
And my hair is so long it gets stuck in my butt crack

I'm always saying 'eff' cause I'm so scared of cursing
How girls do this and that, then I make a boy version
All these dating topics are just a big diversion
So you don't notice I'm a big old virgin

You can find my face on billboards and taxi cabs
But I'm only getting views cause YouTube runs my ads
And I hate Air Canada I complain like a child
But I still fly with them because I'm getting air miles

My toes are never done, so I can never wear sandals
And I wear boys jeans just to hide my love handles
In fact, I'm kind of a dude, and so understand
When people say, "yo are you that boy, Superman?!"

And I walk into auditions, get rejected every time
Unless they need some promo, then it's my time to shine
Cause then I get a cameo where I have one line
And I'm on screen for less time than when I'm in a vine

And I am so single cause I'm always scaring guys
And my boobs are always sagging, cause I don't know my bra size
I'm really really awkward if I ever try to be girly
Forever alone, even this beat left me early
[Sighs]
Shemurr!
