I didn't want to have to go and do this now
But my daughter very bad and she always acting out
So I diss her on this track, kids hear me shout
Better rap than the crap coming out of Lilly's mouth

She think she cool, she have so many views
She on TV, everyday on the news
But they only watch for me now, ain't that the truth
That's why they ask about your mommy daddy in interviews

6 million subs and she don't pay no rent
I'm over it like I'm jumping the fence
Am I a mom or am I your bank accountant?
Get out my house now, let me buy you a tent

They say you look like your mom, I'm like don't insult me
I got curves, she wear extra large tee
I have two kids but people think I have three
They a photo of you and ask 'who is he? '

SCREW LOOOSEEEEE, her mind not okay
They making scary movie about her birthday
Her brain is backwards they call her cray cray
That's why she always wear her hat the wrong way

Why you put all these holes in your face? (Hein?)
You could change your name to Helbig still won't have grace
And they wouldn't call you that grace, noo
They take one look at you and call you dis-grace

Talk back to me, take it easy
Talk back to me, take it easy
Talk back to me, I'll will cancel wifi
Leave your youtube channel looking like static TV

I don't know about computers, I'm no Bill Gates
But I pay my own bills, something you can't say
Acting like royalty in my house every day
I'm still waiting for my royalties to be paid

Your closet full but you still shopping more
Clothes for your tour gonna make us go poor
Spending cash like it's your mom's store
But is that your world tour
Or your mom's tour? (OHHHHH)

Cause I can hear them chanting my name
Paramjeet, paramjeet, now who really got fame?
Post status, ask them what they want see
900 likes on a video with paramjeet

Now you forget about me like the clothes you don't fold
Now you forget about me like the clothes you don't fold
I am boss, I will bring storm so cold
That Mother Nature will tag me and write hashtag 'goals'
10 hours of labour and pain
But your still so selfish, it's a shame
Never think of anyone else for a change
That's why you have ii around your dumb name...
