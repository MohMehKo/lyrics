There is a war going on inside our head
The good versus the bad, the scared versus the brave
There is no single victor for the war goes on for a lifetime
Back and forth the voices go
Perhaps there was never meant to be a winner
And the real prize is to be self-aware
To befriend your voices
And from time to time, give them a microphone

I'm the best, I'm the best that ever was
And I'm the best that ever will be
All the success, that's all me
I don't need anybody else
I did it all my own, all my success is all I need
Lilly, you're the best

They think that I fail when they see me on YouTube
"Who is she?" They don't have a clue (don't have a clue!)
"Man, she ain't funny, I don't understand, yo
How does she gets views? (how does she get views?)
These numbers ain't nothing
She tripping straight up, yo
This girl is confused,"
I trip all the way onto Forbes, damn
Let me tie up my shoes

Who am I, who am I?
Hello, nice to meet you
My name is the news
Haters say "Hi" to your sisters
And tell them I say,
"Yo, thanks for the views!"
I got three L's in my name
But yo, don't get it twisted
Get W's
My money like a pair of Nikes
My checks, they comin' in twos

When you sleepin', I work
When you slackin', I work
When you clubbin', I don't do the same
When you breakin', I work
When you quittin', I work
When you fakin', I don't play that game
When you frontin', I work
When you talkin', I work
When you cryin', I go through the pain

You flexin' your arms
I'm flexin' my life
'Cause homie, my hustle got gains

Back in the day they used to say,
"You will not get far,"
But now today, my Insta page
Looking like postcards (woo)
These people don't move, they run outta gas
Their hustle is idle
I'm sippin' on booze, flying first class
Texting my idols

If you don't know me, I replace TV
So yeah, I'm entitled
If you don't like me, kiss my booty
With some Bawse (that ish will last a while)

If I'm in a good mood I might mention you
And give you some hype
Tag you in a pic
And give you a career
For the rest of your life (RAH!)

(Double tap, double tap, double tap) [x4]

Hello?
What if I'm successful and all alone?
I don't wanna do this anymore (I'm so alone)
I just want my friends, I want my family
I don't wanna do this, I don't wanna be alone
Can somebody please talk to me right now?
(I'm not happy)

I'm working hard to make my family proud
But maybe they just wanna see me more
What if I'm all alone before a crowd
And the only friend I have with me is Forbes

Is it worth it? (I don't know)
Do I deserve it? (Probably not)
I think I'm destined for greatness but I'm unsure of it
I moved so far away from everything I know
That was the only way I thought that I could grow
I see amazing things, I meet amazing folks
You ask the joy it brings? I couldn't tell you though
I'm always on the go, no time to take it in
I meet my idols, then I'm searching for the next win

I don't know what I'm doing
I'm making this all up
What if talent isn't true and this was all luck
Do people love me for me
Or do they love my stats
If I didn't have all of that, would they have my back?

I miss having conversation, I try
But it's hard to have patience
When it's selfies before hi
Like, "Can I take a selfie?"
No "Hi, how are you?"
Yeah, for sure, uncle
It's nice to see you too

My choices make me lonely
I don't let people hold me
I'm addicted to success
Scared to get some rest
Killing myself slowly
Claiming nobody knows me
And it took this beat to confess
That I'm a mess (I'm a mess)
I don't what I'm doing
God, give me a sign
I don't know what I'm doing
I'm making this all up
And I'm a mess

Just, feeling so insecure right now
I, I don't want anybody to look at me
Or touch me or talk to me
Just, just leave me alone, I'm alone
That's, that's all I know (don't touch me)

Had such a long day
Just want somebody to hold me
Somebody to touch me and feel me
Make me feel like I'm the one

I don't wanna talk, I work a long day
So I wanna know, can you work a long night?
I don't wanna talk, I work a long day
So I wanna know, can you work a long night?

I like the way you look
When I'm in this dress
Can you make me think less
When I'm feeling super sexy
I don't care what's right
I want you next to me
Make me forget my responsibilities

I don't wanna tell you 'bout my day
I just wanna use your body in the most selfish way
I'm feelin' myself, feelin' some type of way
Only thing would be better
Is you feelin' me

Can you pull me really close, kiss up on my neck
Then we switch roles, and we start to sweat
Don't you dare stop now
Chills up and down, fingers down my spine
Heavy breathing sound, bodies start to grind
Don't you dare talk now

Let me let go of myself
Let me be a side of me
That people never see
(Can you let go of yourself
Let me see a side of you
That people never see)

I'm a tomboy with a figure, underneath that T-shirt
Trace the curves with your finger, but you better make it quick
Took a break from the hustle, I need to get back to it
It's your lucky day, I work hard and they say
That's also how you gotta pay
Can you please stop talking
Put some Queen Bee on repeat, let's get it poppin'

I am the sexiest person on the planet right now
I just want you next to me and I want you to feel me
Feel how confident I am right now
No playin' around, no jokes

I don't give an eff about anything
No, I'm not serious, I'm not sexy
I'm a goofball, I'm just playing around
I don't care, life's too short

I'm sexy and I know it
Wearing spanx and I show it
Got stretch marks on my booty
All these carbs are bound to grow it
And I don't give any effs
Life's too blessed to be stressed
But if your name is Efron
I'mma step out of this dress

Yeah, right, like I shaved my legs, I didn't
I don't have a thigh gap
But I sure got all the trimmings
And I can't do a smokey eye
No matter how hard I try
So I use that eye shadow
To turn myself to a guy
Drawing beards on my face
Putting wigs on my head
Double tapping Nick Bateman
While I'm lying in my bed

Holla, love handles, I got them love handles
No pedicure, rocking open-toe sandals, holla
Love handles, I got them love handles
Hella split ends in my hair, so tangled
And I am such a G, unicorns all on my feet
Sipping half a Cosmo, got me dancing so off-beat
My outfit not on point and my nails not on fleek
Spray tan effing up all my clean white sheets (shemurr!)

Life is really good
Yeah, my life is kind of perfect
I can see the whole world, like I'm Jasmine on a carpet
I don't have a single problem, I think I deserve it
I'm like Sixth Harmony, baby, I am so worth it

Got my heels in my hand
And I'm walking down the street
I can't wait to eat some fries
Then go straight to get some sleep

I don't care about anything
Life is perfect, the world is perfect
People are perfect
Hugging people, loving people
Drinking my drink, doing my dance
I'm on top of the world right now

I don't know why I always pretend
Like everything's okay because it's not
It's not okay, the world is not okay
The world is not happy
The world's a bad place

How can I sleep
How can I eat
How can I live
When freedom isn't really free
'Cause I am a failure
Not just me but rather
We all fail if
People don't know black lives matter

My money don't mean nothing
If equal pay ain't the standard
Tryna tweet these changes
But 140 letters can't change strangers
It's not enough to be
A diamond in the rough
'Cause if you sit to pee
At the bottom of the ladder

We got clowns in elections
Never pay them no attention
But their hate is progressing
That's a reflection of who we are
Who are we?
We killin' people for love
And people, we don't know how to stop it
We just makin' trending topics

Why aren't we aiding AIDS?
When it comes to real problems
We need some hearing aids
Some priorities, some respect
Instead we reading about
Which two celebs just had sex

Girls are getting raped
That ain't the fault of mini-skirts
That ain't because of alcohol
Or because she liked to flirt
That's because we made a place
Where she has less of a worth
And offenders walk away
While the victims lay to hurt

You scared of Muslims?
I'm scared of your mentality
Your weak mind is why
We have so much damn brutality
A war on terrorism
Bigger war on ignorance
Nice Muhammad Ali tattoo
I guess ignorance is bliss (salaam!)

People are drowning in the water that we drink (that we drink)
Tryna escape war, what more you got to think?
You would rather let them sink than to let them in
Borders, money, politics, eff the human condition
That's the world we live in
Killing them, letting them die
Now what's the difference
We are killers, we are hateful
Are we blessed and ungrateful?
The solution and the problem
We can't just pray, we gotta solve 'em (one more time)
Stop praying, shut up and solve 'em

We are the problem to our goddamn problems
How can you sleep? How can you eat?
You are the problem to your goddamn problems
We are the problem to our goddamn problems
Shut up and just solve 'em

We all have these voices in our head
But regardless of their presence
It's up to us to decide which ones to use
Which ones to base our actions on
And which ones define us
It's not about the voices in your head
It's about what you do with them
