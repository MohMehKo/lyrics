[Intro:]
You know when you get sick and tired
Of the same ol' whip
Of the same ol' chick
And the same ol' bricks

Getting sick and tired of that old money, get some new racks
Get sick and tired of that old bitch, get a foreign one
Gettin' sick and tired of them playing cars, so what I'm a cop a foreign one

And I'm sick and tired of this old money, bitch what is coming with this chick
Jury got me freezing, bitch I need a check-up
And I be going hard on beats I'm like what's next up?
And all the gangsters fuck with me so throw your sense up
