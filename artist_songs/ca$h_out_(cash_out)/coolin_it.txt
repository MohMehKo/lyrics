Not turn around no fam but shit she blew me
She got a big booty, I got a big dick
Girl tell me have you ever drove a stick
I'm shifting gears, I'm going fast I'm going slow
I'm going fast, I'm going slow on another nigga hoe

While all these other niggas try to sell some fucking hope

And he let 'em go for the 20 Brian dock us
Shit your bitch is in the bush ye she stalking
And be buy the bat little nigga's just for the talking

Automatic shit, ye we spit in rounds
And silencers on them guns you won't hear a sound
