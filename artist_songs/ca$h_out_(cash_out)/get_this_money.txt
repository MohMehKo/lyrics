[Hook: x2]
All I
Wanna
Do is get this money
And keep on stunting
You can't tell me nothin'

[Verse 1:]
All I want is money
Bitch I mean them hunneds
Ye I should french you nigga because you frontin
And if you throw me that pussy girl I'm gon' dunk it
Had a truck with an engine ye she thought I would be in front it
And that real nigga shit, gon' suck a real nigga dick
I make a real nigga flick
Walk around with so much money I should have my tomb
But just 'cause I ain't flash my shit don't mean I ain't got my tune
Nah I don't really play the spades
But if you ask me shit, I'm gonna say yay
Caught a waitress order up 20 other spades
This the life I'm living baby I'm in to say hooray

[Hook: x2]
All I
Wanna
Do is get this money
And keep on stunting
You can't tell me nothin'

[Verse 2:]
I used to hang out in the streets, now I'm on TV
Real gold, no ice check out the rollie
Yo bitch wanna buy me something, oh can't afford me
I hit a bitch so good, she wanna spore me
Have game just right, it keep me going
Blowing gas in the bush, it keep me flowing
Your boy betta have a gun, 'cause I'm holdin
Bad bitches everywhere, ass just showing
Money, that's my occupation so I keep chasing
And racing, stacking these phases can't tell me anythin'
All I wanna do is get some money
And I keep on stunting

[Hook: x2]
All I
Wanna
Do is get this money
And keep on stunting
You can't tell me nothin'
