[Interlude:]
Hol' up, hol' up, card grow up till I roll up
Got killas with me, you can slow up
Pullin' up pray, movin' slow as fuck
Fuck nigga, that's me behavin' on nothin'

Boss up (boss up) boss up (boss up)
Card boy just got bossed up

My car boss up, shootin' stars, she wanna boss up
Aye, aye, boss up (boss up) boss up (boss up)

My watch boss up, shootin' star boss up, aye

[Verse 1:]
Hold up lil bitch, who sayin' we ain't gettin' money?
Valet park my whip, just to let 'em know I'm stuntin'
Money by the bundle, pianos by the truckload
Hol' up, pull up with the truckload
Hol' up, tell a nigga unload
Some say it's right in my face
Baby, I can taste it
Money got me drunk, baby, I'm wasted
Black and white, donald [?] shit, I ain't racist
Shout out to my lawyer, he beat out my cases
Money talkin' loud, echo
And he knew his girl would cheat and shit
That why he had to call Grecko
Projects to the private jet flow
[?] be my rondoe, yo girl is in my tub, tho
Overseas ya know we bossed up
Get tossed up, baby

[Hook:]
Boss up (boss up) boss up (boss up)
My chain boss up, my watch boss up
My car boss up, shootin' stars, she wanna boss up
Aye, aye, boss up (boss up) boss up (boss up)
My chain boss up, my car boss up
My watch boss up, shootin' star boss up, aye

[Verse 2:]
Hol' up, hol' up, card grow up till I roll up
Got killas with me, you can slow up
Pullin' up pray, movin' slow as fuck
Fuck nigga, that's me behavin' on nothin'
Said if I was you I would get bossed up
Boss up (boss up) boss up (boss up)
Card boy just got bossed up
That verse go from old block, old block, we toe blocks
Old block, we toe blocks
Ya get shot, ya get shot
And I done came up still on the same block
And I done came up still on the same block
And I became still this fucka ops
And the killas with me they love Glocks
Thuga Thuga and Young, that's the third shot
Clip long, hang out, lookin' like a mop
And you ain't bout that action

[Hook:]
Boss up (boss up) boss up (boss up)
My chain boss up, my watch boss up
My car boss up, shootin' stars, she wanna boss up
Aye, aye, boss up (boss up) boss up (boss up)
My chain boss up, my car boss up
My watch boss up, shootin' star boss up, aye
