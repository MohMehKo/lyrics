I want to go to Mexico
I heard they got it for the low
She wonder why my wrist here glow
Because I came from Mexico

I wanna go to Mexico
I wanna go to Mexico
I wanna go to Mexico
I heard they got it for the low

I know that they cheap, they driving a Jeep
I'm up in the kitchen, I'm whipping a pitch
I heard amigo got it for the low
I wanna go to Mexico
I go to Africa to get my diamonds
I go to LA just to join the club
I go to Miami they dig my hoe

But for the blow I wanna go to Mexico

I know that they snitching I know that they snitch
I'm up in the kitchen
They bitches, they love me, the way that I kick it
Kick back, roll on me, you came for it
Shooters on four corners, I mean that's cold

I want to go to Mexico
I heard they got it for the low
She wonder why my wrist here glow
Because I came from Mexico

I wanna go to Mexico

Start talking the real, bring in them kitchens
Like that chick, cause I got a witness
We take em' to waist

No re-roc
Boy I got soldiers, no reeboks
Wish we, I'm three fly come from Amsterdam
In a foreign baby yeah I'm in a lamb
Gonna let you know we take a trip down to Mexico

And make that shit right back
You saying I ain't gotta sack
Green Bay yeah I got the pack
I flip it go get my racks
Then re-up and reload
Then what's up and what's on my wishlist is Mexico

I want to go to Mexico
I heard they got it for the low
She wonder why my wrist here glow
Because I came from Mexico

I wanna go to Mexico
I wanna go to Mexico
I wanna go to Mexico
I heard they got it for the low
