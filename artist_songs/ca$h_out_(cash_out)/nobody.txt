[Hook:]
Tell me who fucking with you
Nobody fucking with you
I know now I'm telling the truth
Nobody fucking with you
Can do the little things you do
Can't tell me I ain't feeling you
Ain't nobody fucking with you

And when I'm tired ain't nobody cooking but you

[Verse 2:]
Stepping out the lambo in the red bottoms
Hit some million when you touch the ground
And I love it when you serve me down
I be backing up don't hurt me now
Nobody, hold the pistol like you hold it
Shit, you buy it Master P but I roll with you
And when we get home you know I'm fucking you
And you know we can do it out in public too
Eat you up, public's food
Eight plus gration I'm schooling you
9 in my pants that's that tooling booth
And nobody's fucking with you

[Bridge:]
Girl you gotta be the baddest I ever seen
Just like Angelina Jolie
You fuck with me, I fuck with you
We ride out bandz on dry top cool
Money flying everywhere
California breeze girl your hair going everywhere
I swag on, I put the jag on
Show money couple racks, that's why I sag on
Flashy nigga, cut my chains on
I know you love me babe 'cause the same song
Plus you got my shit on your ring tone
Pussy so good, girl your head got my mind going, swag

[Hook:]
Tell me who fucking with you
Nobody fucking with you
I know now I'm telling the truth
Nobody fucking with you
Can do the little things you do
Can't tell me I ain't feeling you
Ain't nobody fucking with you
Nobody fucking with you
