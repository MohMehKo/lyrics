Money dup blow so ride 'round with that Nina (ride 'round with that Nina)
With a Hollywood hoe with lips like Angelina (lips like Angelina)
My diamonds talk for me they say how can I meet ya? (how can I meet ya?)
G flyer then sky how high, hoe I can't see ya (hoe I can't see ya)
Got an island on my wrist, girl, I'm cashin' out (I'm cashin' out)
Got an island on my neck, girl, I'm cashin' out (I'm cashin' out)
My diamonds talk for me they say how can I meet ya?
G flyer then sky how high, hoe I can't see ya

[Akon:]
I got T-Pian around my wrist, Gaga around my neck
Got o' money so long, I ain't even cashin' them cashin them checks
I keep wide 3's on my feet, still ridin' 'round with that heat
Foreign cars in my garage, all these bad bitches I beat
Oops! Is that your girl? She said her name was Nina
Oo-Oops! Ridin' 'round, gettin' head from a girl named Nina
Oops! I'm sorry, but I'm on my Ike and Tina (Ike and Tina)
I'm African so you know I got hyenas
I cashed out on my whips, I cashed out from my check
Though I chemp TV again, got that stations all in my crib
Got a indoor court, outdoor court
Indoor pool, outdoor pool
I ain't lyin', nigga tell em' it's true
Ask Ray he done be there too

Grab the top, hop in, hoes they comin by flocks in
Birds they comin by flocks in
Pass them birds like stockton

Ridin 'round blowin' on stank bombs

And it's fuck a Buggatti I'm callin' my jet, cool

And I'm on the money mission, nobody can stop me
Just grab your camcorder, press record and go on and watch me
And you can skate on my ice just like you playin hockey
And in the booth I beat the beat up call me Rocky
Yea, I'm cocky cool
