[Hook:]
You hidin' we ridin', you hidin' we ridin'
And if you bust shit we bust it back
But we bustin' first so it ain't no bustin' back
You hidin' we ridin', you hidin' we ridin'
You hidin' we ridin'
And we bust first nigga it ain't no bustin' back

[Verse 1:]
Ye, I ain't hungover shit, I wanna eat your plate
Goons won't call away and they will eat your face
And you pussy niggas better check my background
She's wearing the face while you back in that grind that ass so back blow
You hidin' we ridin', bullies hit your ass colliding
Now he got to arise it shopping leave him locked up
Call leave that little ass slumbed up
Ye, put pressure on this rap game oh yes I peep shit
Then put pressure on niggas when it comes to street shit
And I know they want me back on that street shit
But I won't let the feds get me caught up in that beef shit
I'm smooth

[Hook:]
You hidin' we ridin', you hidin' we ridin'
And if you bust shit we bust it back
But we bustin' first so it ain't no bustin' back
You hidin' we ridin', you hidin' we ridin'
You hidin' we ridin'
Shit, and we bust first nigga it ain't no bustin' back

[Verse 2:]
This that, little motherfucking brains on dashboard news
They ask for clips so boy I'm a shoot your movie
Ye, I was at the top boy I'm gonna hit your cuffie
And his body wet and he ain't left no jacuzzi
And that's a 4 10
I mean a 10 4, riding in that '64
And we pulling kick those, we don't do no drive-byes
Tryin' to hit everything and don't leave nothing alive
Get it, got grades for your body, get it
Did you just get what I said, ya did
I know my boys could get you frustrated
But when it comes to murking niggas, we ain't hesitating
You hide, we ride

[Hook:]
You hidin' we ridin', you hidin' we ridin'
And if you bust shit we bust it back
But we bustin' first so it ain't no bustin' back
You hidin' we ridin', you hidin' we ridin'
You hidin' we ridin'
Shit, and we bust first nigga it ain't no bustin' back
