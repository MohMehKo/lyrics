[Intro:]
Know how you feel, take this pain away
I wake up, I talk to God and I say

[Hook:]
Wake up, say, "Lord, take this pain away"
I don't want to say okay today
I might want to fly a plane today
I know some niggas like we feel the same, aye
Want white wine with a big-ass house
Want to put my niggas in a penthouse
Yeah, Lord, take this pain away
Cause I don't want to say okay today
Yeah, Lord, take this pain away
Cause I don't want to say okay today

[Verse 1:]
Have you ever woke up and felt like, "Fuck that shit"?
I'm a do it with my pack, I'm a chase my dreams
Salute to a [?], salute to the fiends
Why buy bricks?
They chargin' too much, plus the plug might snitch
You think you on top but you livin' in a ditch
So you better have a game plan
When you jump in this game man
Yeah, I'm just tellin' the truth
If he ain't 'bout some shit, he tellin' on you
And if he ain't tellin' shit, he hatin' on you
But you better find you little ass up safety, dude

[Hook:]
Wake up, say, "Lord, take this pain away"
I don't want to say okay today
I might want to fly a plane today
I know some niggas like we feel the same, aye
Yeah, Lord, take this pain away
Cause I don't want to say okay today
Sometimes I want to cry
Real nigga shit'll make you cry
Lord, take this pain away

[Verse 2:]
I know somebody wakin' up just like me
Feelin' the same way today
Or to wake up
And tell they mama she ain't got to go to work
Or to put up on they niggas
Tell 'em put down that work
Or to have they daughter one little sweet sixteen
Or to see themselves kickin' shit on the big screen
I have the same feelin'
Every day I wake up, I say I'm gon' make a killin'
Murder one
And I told my family every day we gon' ride for 'em
And I told my family every year we gon' be toruin'

[Hook:]
Wake up, say, "Lord, take this pain away"
I don't want to say okay today
I might want to fly a plane today
I know some niggas like we feel the same, aye
Lord, take this pain away
Cause I don't want to say okay today
