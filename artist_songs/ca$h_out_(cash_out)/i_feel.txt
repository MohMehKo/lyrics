And I feel, like nobody can fuck with me

[Verse 1:]
Let's throw a party on this beach
Ye, and murder this pussy
Get into bed I murdered that pussy
And when I'm in these streets
You heard that I murdered that pussy
So ain't no playing with me
Been in them trucks, hating pricks man
They wouldn't lay with me
Lay down them choppers so shit
Ain't no really playing with me
And if she been round me
You know that she be laying with me
Had to brace myself for all this cash and this wealth
Shit I'd be good for your health
Man being round a broke nigga
Man it be bad for your health
And I swear I spit all my leg
For this shit what they call it belt
She said she won't ride with no rocks
I said you want it ring well I need racks
And you must ain't checked the stocks
You just put your money on me baby

[Hook:]
And I feel, like nobody can fuck with me
With me, haha yeah
And I feel, like nobody can fuck with me
With me, with me

[Verse 2:]
Right now, I'm drinking cranberry juice
Fuck champagne!
I'm a start making these nigga pay to get in my campaign
Like the president, 'cause I'm so relevant
You're irelevant, nobody hear you
Nobody see you, I wouldn't wanna be you
And all these hoes they be like, hey
Hey can I meet you?
J like my song, Louie V her thong
And I go all night long
No Miley
Fuck her real good
Send her to work, feelin' all jolly
I'm feeling confident
I should walk around with my dick out
So many bricks I might fuck around a bit of brick house
So many joints I might fuck around a bettle stick house
And don't play I might fuck around and put a stake out
There's 30 in that clip
And there's 30 in your ass

[Hook:]
And I feel, like nobody can fuck with me
With me, haha yeah
And I feel, like nobody can fuck
