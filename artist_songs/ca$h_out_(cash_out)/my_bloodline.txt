[Hook:]
Cold, money ain't got no deadline
But getting money, bitch is in my bloodline
Ye and at the table man we toasting wine
Bought the rollie for the shine, nigga fuck the time
My wrist gold, my shoes cool
Them bricks cold, how 'bout you
Money ain't got no deadline
But getting money, bitch is in my bloodline

[Verse 1:]
Get back hoe, I stepped on you
Going in on this beast like a terrorist I bombed you
Niggas talking about go vote!, I'm voting for Benjamin Franklin
'Cause the money gon' change the world nigga what the fuck you think
Land in my bed, Louie V my blanket
Money under my mattress, and I'm fucking an actress
RT, that's real talk!
Money in my pants, now watch me do the money walk
Forley me on, bitch we eat good
And we don't see that top, bitch we see wood
That's court side talking to them players
Bitch we're some bosses so you talkin to some players

[Hook:]
Cold, money ain't got no deadline
But getting money, bitch is in my bloodline
Ye and at the table man we toasting wine
Bought the rollie for the shine, nigga fuck the time
My wrist gold, my shoes cool
Them bricks cold, how 'bout you
Money ain't got no deadline
But getting money, bitch is in my bloodline

[Verse 2:]

Shit and I keep that pistol nigga I'm my own muscle
Been getting money got my own hussle
Never been a dick rider, but she's a dick rider
And I got my own wifi
Just for these hoes connecting me
And the plug keep wanna connect with me
Beat the pussy up now I got your man girlfriend cop with me
They asking me why the jury act so arrogant
And it's shining hard, ain't really with that starring shit
And my diamonds talk man, ye baby it's on that para shit
And I'm getting overseas money ye baby I'm on that parachute

[Hook:]
Cold, money ain't got no deadline
But getting money, bitch is in my bloodline
Ye and at the table man we toasting wine
Bought the rollie for the shine, nigga fuck the time
My wrist gold, my shoes cool
Them bricks cold, how 'bout you
Money ain't got no deadline
But getting money, bitch is in my bloodline
