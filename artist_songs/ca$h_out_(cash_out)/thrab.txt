Bitch I got a check but I ain't gon
Spend on no thrab [x7]
Spend it on no thrab
Spend it on no thrab

[Verse 1:]
A thrab what's that
Ask my nigga Tank about it
She licked it up and don't spit it up
She don't take time to think about it
No classy hoe
She a nasty hoe
It don't take time to stab da hoe
That thrab there
That Doorknob
Everybody don grabbed that hoe
That thrab there that Bugatti
Everybody know she too fast
Talkin about relationships
I ain't tryin to cuff up that loose ass
I'm gon smash da hoe then pass da hoe
Turn back around and smash sum moe
Den gas up on dat loudpack
Ya'll already know we got cash to blow
Her name was Tina about 5'4
Said she stayed on Godby Road
And I really ain't got to say too much
Because everybody know about them garbage hoes
She say she know I got a check and
It's more den you can have
Told lil bitch I got a check but I ain't gon spend
It on no thrab

[Hook:]
Bitch I got a check but I ain't gon
Spend on no thrab [x7]
Spend it on no thrab

[Verse 2:]
Let me take you to the Westside
I thank her name was Keisha
Bout 5'5 in ala Temple
She had sum pretty features
She fucked my nigga Yayo
She fucked my nigga Ace
She fucked my nigga Eli
And I see you wanna face
I scrolled down my call log
Look for somethin to stab
I ran across a numba that I saved under thrab
I'm checked up
So I pulled up

She always let my crew cut
Got Spinz on d beat so I ain't losin

Ain't you know I left her face oozin
She said she got a man
And I just sit back need laugh
Her friend texin me while she sexin me
Now that's what I call sum thrabs

Spend on no thrab [x7]
