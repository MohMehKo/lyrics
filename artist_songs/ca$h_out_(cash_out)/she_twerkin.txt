See me grabbin' on my tooly
She told me smack her on the booty
She say I got too many hoes
She say I got too many shows

But she twerkin [x8]

What's up, baby? I see you, you watching
Versace like Biggie, my watch is Rolly

Oh, no, no, pay for it, be foreign, go touring
A nigga so burry, drive her out when hes snoring
He kiki for the free-free took lil kiki to Waikiki
Put Louis, with Gucci, put a hoochie with a hoochie
We do the hoochie coochie but I'm still grabbing on my tooly,

See me grabbin on my tooly
She told me smack her on the booty
She say I got too many hoes
She say I got too many shows

But she twerkin [x8]

These hoes, they tardy, they missing, I'm sorry
Ferragamo for freak-o, I seize this cappuccino
Baby, I'm beating nino, that your boyfriend, I bet you he know
Got your girl saying I want to do foo-foo
Got your girl at my front door in a tutu
Yeah, she got that million dollar mouth, ooh, ooh
Spenz and dyeing on a beast, say ooh, ooh

See me grabbin on my tooly
She told me smack her on the booty
She say I got too many hoes
She say I got too many shows

But she twerkin [x8]
