Who am I but you and the sun
A slight reflection of everyone
Was it me who let you walk away?
Were you the one
Or is it we're the same

What are we in time going by
The simple story of a younger life
Half in dreams and somehow through the day
We haven't come so far to lose our way

Look at me, I believe it's true
You're a part of me, I'm a part of you

Love is only what we come to live
The waking, breathing and all we give
A crystal passing reflected in our eyes
Eclipsing all the jealousy and lies

Look at me, can't you see it's true
You're a part of me, I'm a part of you

Quiet as the voices in a dream
Without two shadows the things I've seen
Remember the evening I let you walk away
Were you the one
Or is it we're the same

Look at me, i believe it's true
You're a part of me, I'm a part of you
