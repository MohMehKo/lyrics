Johnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off

Look out, kid, it's something you did
God knows when, but you're doing it again
Better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend
Man in the coonskin cap in the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills, you only got ten

Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talking that the heat put plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway, Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May, orders from the D.A.

Look out, kid, don't matter what you did
Walk on your tiptoes, don't try No Doz
Better stay away from those that carry 'round a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plainclothes
To know which way the wind blows

Get sick, get well, hang around an inkwell
Ring a bell, hard to tell, it's gonna sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, write Braille
Get jailed, jump bail, join the army if you fail

Look out, kid, it's something you did
God knows when, but you're doing it again
Better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend
Man in the coonskin cap in the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills, you only got ten

The man in the coonskin cap in the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills, you only got ten
