Who's the man who stole fire for the people?
Who causes trembling in the bones of evil?
Who carved a mountain into a cathedral?

Down, down, they keep tryna take me down
Down, down, they keep tryna take me down
It's all right, I go dreaming
I think it's all right

But I'm tryin'
The blood of lions
No, I ain't dying
I am immortal
So immortal
I am immortal

Who rides the solar cycle with no hands, Ma?
Who found the ark inside Texarkana?
Who asks the questions that have no answers?

Down, down, they get tryna take me down
Down, down, they get tryna take me down

And there was four angels
Standing at the four corners of the earth
Holding back the winds from blowing
And there was another angel coming from the west

I am immortal

Half-blind and spitting straight into the wind
Down, down, they get tryna take me down
It's all right, sometimes I go dreaming
It's all right

'Cause I've been tryin'
The blood of lions
No, I ain't dying
I am immortal
So immortal
'Cause I'm immortal
I am immortal
Immortal
