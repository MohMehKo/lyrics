This heart of mine, be ye still
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill
Don't let her know, don't let her know that you love her
Don't be fool, don't be blind
This heart of mine

This heart of mine, go back home
You got no reason to wander, you got no reason to roam
Don't let her see, don't let her see you need her
Don't put yourself over the line, over the line
This heart of mine

This heart of mine, you know she'll never be true
She'll only give to others the love she's gotten from you
Don't let her know where you're going
Don't untie the ties that bind
This heart of mine

Heart of mine, so mean and full of guile
Give you an inch and you take a mile
Don't let yourself fall, don't let yourself stumble
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime
This heart of mine

Don't let her know she's blind, so blind
This heart of mine
