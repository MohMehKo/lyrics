Travelin' in the dark,
Can't see a thing
Travelin' in the dark

Travelin' in the dark
Can't see a thing
Travelin' in the dark

What you gonna do when you can't seem to understand?
How ya' gonna feel when your woman's with another man?

Travelin' in the dark
Can't see a thing
Travelin' in the dark

Travelin' in the dark 
Can't see a thing
Travelin' in the dark

What makes you think that you're ever gonna understand?
What's goin' on in the mind of another man? 

Travelin' in the dark 
Can't see a thing
Travelin' in the dark

Travelin' in the dark
Can't see a thing
Travelin' in the dark

What you gonna do when you can't seem to understand?
How ya' gonna feel when your woman's with another man?
