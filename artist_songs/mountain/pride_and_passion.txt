One man's life passed all in needing.
Words out loud that want repeating.
Fathers passed to sons their craving.
Woman's loved.
Their children saving kings who walk with banners waving still.
I have no heart for listening to the men who talk of peace.
They're putting all their nonsense in my way.
won't you please, my love, please rest your tired little hands.
We've been talking half the night and there's so much more to say.
