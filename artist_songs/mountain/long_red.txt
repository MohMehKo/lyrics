Long red, flowin' through my mind
Dreamin' here'n, dreamin' there, two pieces all the time

Soft red, whispers in my dreams
Bits and pieces in my arms, it ain't always what it seems

Long red - helpin' you to find a day
Bright red - how'm I gonna find a way

Bright Red, you have changed me too
Stranger now, it seems somehow, bright red has turned to blue

Long red, tears and shades of gray
I have changed you, I have lost - forever, from today

Long red - helpin' you to find a day
Bright red - how'm I gonna find a way

Long red, tears and shades of gray
I have changed you, I have lost - forever, from today
