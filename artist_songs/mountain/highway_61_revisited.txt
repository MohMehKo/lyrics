Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son"
Abe says, "Man, you must be putting me on"
God says, "No" Abe says, "What?"
God says, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
The next time you see me coming, you better run"
Well, Abe said, "Where do you want this killing done?"
God says, "Out on Highway 61"

Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes
He asked Poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know"
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man, and I gotta run"
Old Howard just pointed with his gun
And said, "That way, down Highway 61"

Well, Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
"I got forty red, white and blue strings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
And Louie the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son"
And he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61"

Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told her father that things weren't right
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white"
He said, "Come here, and step into the light"
He says, "Hmm, you're right
Let me tell the second mother this has been done"
But the second mother was with the seventh sun
And they were both out on Highway 61

Now the Roving Gambler, he was very bored
He was trying to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done
We'll just put up some bleachers out in the sun 
And have it on Highway 61"
