Well she was born in a north woods town
Twenty-one winters ago
And she grew tired of the freezing cold
And living in the blinding snow

But this girl knew she wouldn't be there long
'Cause she had plans and dreams
And she'd seen pictures of the sunshine state
In the pages of the magazine

So she waited them tables and she used her smile
Saving every penny she can
For a one-way Dixie bound Amtrak ticket
Headed for the promised land

Her momma and daddy begged her not to go
When the day she dreamed of came
And she waved goodbye sittin' way up high
From the window of a southbound train

Now she's got a fire burnin' deep inside
Ridin' on a southbound train
And the clickity-clack of that railroad track
Only helps to fan the flames
No more worries, no more cares
She left them up in Bangor, Maine

Now she's startin' a brand new life
Ridin' on a southbound train
Whoa...

She said, 'Hello sun, good mornin' Daytona
You're sure lookin' good to me
With your ocean breeze and your tall palm trees
And your southern hospitality'
Now she's a knockout queenie in a string bikini
She's drivin' all the boys insane
And this all started with a small town dream
And a ticket on a southbound train
'Cause she had a fire burnin' deep inside
Ridin' on a southbound train
And the clickity-clack of that railroad track
Only helps to fan the flames
No more worries, no more cares
She left them up in Bangor, Maine
Yeah she likes the boys with the southern drawl
Soakin' up the sunshine, havin' a ball
She'll be the first to tell you that she owes it all
To ridin' on a southbound train
Whoa...oh...
