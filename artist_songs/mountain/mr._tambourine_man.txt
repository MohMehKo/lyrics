Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man
Play a song for me
I'm not sleepy
And there is no place I'm going to

Take me on a trip upon your magic sailing ship
My senses have been stripped
My hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to go wandering

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man
Play the song for me
In that jingle-jangle morning
I'll come following you

I'm ready to go anywhere
I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade
Cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it

You, hey, Mr. Tambourine Man
Play the song for me
I'm not sleepy 
And there is no place I'm going to

Hey, hey, Mr. Tambourine Man
Play the song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning
I'll come following you

Following you
Following you
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man
Play the song for me
Play the song for me

Jingle-jangle morning
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man
I'll come following you
Mr. Tambourine Man
I'll come following you
