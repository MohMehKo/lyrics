Broken lines, broken strings
Broken threads, broken springs
Broken idols, broken heads
People sleeping in broken beds
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking
Yeah, everything is broken

Broken bottles, broken legs
Broken switches, broken gates
Broken dishes, broken parts
The streets are filled with broken hearts
Broken words never meant to be spoken
Oh, everything is broken

It seems like every time I stop and turn around
Something else has just hit the ground

Broken colors, broken saws
Broken buckles, broken laws
Broken bodies, broken bones
Broken voices on broken phones
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking
Hey yeah, everything is broken

Yeah, every time I leave and go off some place
Things fall to pieces in my face

Broken hands on broken ploughs
Broken treaties and broken vows
Broken pipes, broken tools
People bending broken rules

Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking
Hey hey, everything is broken
Everything is broken
Everything is broken
Everything is broken
Oh yeah, everything is broken
