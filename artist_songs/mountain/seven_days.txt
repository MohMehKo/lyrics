Seven days, seven more days, she'll be coming
I'll be waiting at the station 
For her to arrive
Seven more days, all I gotta do is survive

She been gone ever since I've been a child
Ever since I seen her smile
I never forgotten her eyes
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies

I've been good, I've been good while I'm waiting
Maybe guilty of hesitating
But I've been hanging on
Seven more days, all that'll be gone

There's kissing in the valley 
Thieving in the alley
Fighting every inch of the way
Trying to be tender
With somebody I remember
In a night that's always brighter than the day

Seven days, seven days are a-blowin'
And the whistle will be blowing
She'll be coming forth
My beautiful comrade from the north

There's fighting in the valley 
Thieving in the alley
Fighting every inch of the way, trying to get a lead on
Somebody get a feed on
And the lights are always brighter than the day

Seven  days, I don't know when the wind is blowing
And the whistle will be blowing
She'll be coming fast
My beautiful comrade from the north
