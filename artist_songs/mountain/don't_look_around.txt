Don't look around, 'cause I'm never comin' back.
It's high time you saw the last of me.
You know I was a wanderer, I'd forgotten where to go,
I had no place to lay my head or rest my heavy load.
Don't look around 'cause I'm never comin' back.
It's high time, you saw the last of me.

Lord, how she changed my mind.
Lord she changed my life.

Now I'm workin' all day long, singin' for my food,
Baby, you know that I've got everything I need.
I've given all I can, the rest belongs to me,
Time was it didn't matter just who I had to be.
Don't look around, 'cause I'm never comin' back.
It's high time you saw the last of me.

Lord, how she changed my mind.
Lord, she changed my life. 

I got another woman now, don't need you anymore.
Now I think I'll turn my back and walk away from you.
We're livin' in the country doin' everything we please,
I don't want you comin' 'round, stirrin' up a breeze.
Don't look around, 'cause I'm never comin' back.
It's high time you saw the last of me.

Lord, how she changed my mind.
Lord, she changed my life.
