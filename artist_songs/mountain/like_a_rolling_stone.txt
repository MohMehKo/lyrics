Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
You even thought they were all kidding you

You used to laugh about everybody that was hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal
How does it feel?

I wanna know, how does it feel to be out on your own?
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
Just like a rolling stone

You've gone to the finest school alright, Miss Lonely
But you know you only 
Used to get juiced in it
And nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you gonna find out how to get used to that

You said you'd never compromise 
With the mystery tramp, and now you realize 
He ain't selling any alibis
And as you look into the vacuum of his eyes 
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
How does it feel?

Tell me, how does it feel to be out on your own?
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone

You never turned around to see the frowns 
On the jugglers and the clowns
When they all came down, did tricks for you
You never understood 
That it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people come and get your kicks for you

You used to ride on your chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that 
He really wasn't where it's at?
After he took from you everything he could steal
How does it feel?

Tell me, how does it feel to be out on your own?
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
