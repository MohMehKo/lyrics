I can see you, baby, from a thousand miles away,
And I know you love me, no matter what you say.
I can tell you, baby, where you belong,
By my side at the end of the day, when the work is done.

I can tell when you been sleepin' all day in bed,
And I know what drives you, out of your head.
I can feel your heart beatin' through a cement wall,
And I know you'll come runnin' whenever I call.

Can't fool me (no, no, no)
Can't fool a man who's been around,
You can't leave me (no, no, no)
Without me knowin' where you're goin'
Can't get away

I can touch every breath you take,
And you know with me you can't make no mistake.
Just like butter on a hot summer's day, 
I can melt you baby and leave you that way.

If your heart was a diamond and your love was gold,
You'd be a ring on my finger, you don't need to be told
That it ain't no use tryin' to cheat on me
'Cause everybody knows, where you got to be.

Can't fool me (no, no, no)
Can't fool a man who's been around,
You can't leave me (no, no, no)
Without me knowin' where you're goin'
Can't get away
