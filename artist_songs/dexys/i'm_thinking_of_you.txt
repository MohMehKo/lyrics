From the darkest part of a loneliness of a torn and troubled man,
comes a desperate need to own you, in every way I can,
for while you were gently growing up in this green and pleasant land,
I'd already by then forsaken myself, I was setting up my sham,
I'd describe myself as a wanderer, but you know that's not what I am,
and if you stand beside me we'll go lower than I planned,
because all my life I'm thinking of you.

I'm thinking of you all the time,
I'm thinking of you when I go out,
I'm thinking of you with all my heart,
I'm thinking of you without your clothes,
I'm thinking of you and when you're dressed up,
I'm thinking of you with your legs crossed,
I'm thinking of you  and when they are not, I think of you too
I'm thinking of you, always thinking of you, when I lay down,
I'm thinking of you as I go to sleep,
I'm thinking of you all through the night,
I'm thinking of you and your lovely body and just being with you,
I want to look at you every night,
and hold and caress you through the night,
because no matter what I do,
I'm thinking of you, always thinking of you,
So open your heart and let me come through,
and in all of our life baby I'll be thinking of you,
So open your heart and let me come through,
and in all of our life  I'll be thinking of you, nobody but you,
I can't stop
come on home
Come on back to me.
