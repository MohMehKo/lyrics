Oh baby I really love you, I really do now, Oh baby baby,
I got to say one thing (what's that?)
I want you (Oh alright) and for all time (Oh I see!) Yes
Come over here my dear I've got something to say (What's that?)
Do you know how much I care?
Do you know I'll always be here,
I'm always going to love you
(OK)
When I look at you baby, when I touch you (yessss, what?) oh it feels so good,
Put your lips to my face (alright) Let your sweet breath warm my face (mmm)
I'm always going to love you (I love you too!)awwww!(I'm always going to love you)
We're always going to.......
To be completely honest (yeah?)
I walked into this part without thinking (what do you mean?)
I wasn't thinking (about what?) I'm so confused, I'm so confused
(You just said to me that you loved me?)
I know I did (You said you loved me!)
I know I did but I think I'm going around the bend now we must end...
(WHAT!!??)
I'm sorry darling I don't think I can love you
(You're not sorry!)
I'm really sorry I don't know how to love you
(Kevin don't talk to me I don't even want to see you)
(Kevin don't look at me I don't even want to see you)
I understand I don't know what's the matter with me
Maybe I'm incapable of love? I dunno, no?
(Kevin don't talk to me I don't even want to see you)
(Kevin just Go Go GO!! I don't even want to see you)
(It's like as soon as you got me you didn't want me, I was just your next thing, now your off on some other thing,)
No
(I was like a challenge you just wanted to see if you could get me to try and win me over)
No it wasn't like that you were more than that, you meant an awful lot to me
I'm just mean
(You are!)
(Kevin don't look at me I don't even want to see you)
(Just Go......Just.....GO)
ok
