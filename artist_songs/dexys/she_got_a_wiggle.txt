Listen
She got a wiggle, she got a wiggle that makes me melt,
the problem is that I don't know if she even likes me,
She's such a woman, she's such a woman, she's all I need,
and I'm the one who loves her so, and now you know, and here I go,
I love her face and her soft brown hair,
and the poses she strikes when she's standing there,
she is woman and I just want her,
and in her mind she says; (I'm mad about you)
She's mad about me
She got a voice that's soft and moist,
caresses my ears while heightening my senses,
sexy and warm and tender, I like it,
She got a wiggle, she got a wiggle that makes me melt,
but I'm afraid to let her know, that I'm the one who loves her so,
I love her and in my mind she said(I'm mad about you)
She's mad about me.
but it's only a dream
Got to make this real.
(Can't live without you)
Do you know what I mean?
(I'm mad about you)
She's mad about me
but it's only a dream
She got a wiggle, she got a wiggle that makes me melt,
and I'm somehow gonna find a way to make her love me.
