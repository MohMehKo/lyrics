Close your eyes and you're sure to see apathy 
pass the buck so you don't show sympathy 
the beaten path don't let it lead you misery 
the fear you hold will only cheat you 
don't let it eat you like a cancer 
we all pay for the shit we do 
pass the buck not to me 
out of touch with the things that set us free
pass the buck not to me 
out of touch sitting back while we watch 'em bleed 
senseless, have we gone numb
youth led by image, what have we become
heartless it's the way to be 
maybe it's for you but it's not for me
not for me
