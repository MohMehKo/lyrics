We're the Nails
Unlike all the rest
That stick up from the ground
And they'll never hammer us down
We're the nails
Driven into the cross
Driven in as reminders
That their self-destructive system can only
Violate the world.
Violate the world.
Violate the world.
Their self destructive system can only
Violate the world.
Violate the world.
Violate the world.
But they'll never hammer us down.
