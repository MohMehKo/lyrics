So resented, so disliked
So involved in all the wrong fights
Overbearing influence
Not endearing to any one

wealth and power crashing through
wealth empowers its own views
wealth and power crashing in
on the warpath once again

So resented, so disliked
So involved in all the wrong fights
Domination won't win friends
Just gives rise to hostile trends

It feels good to see freedom excepted
But by free thought, not a gun to the head
It feels good to see freedom embraced
But by strong folk, not a puppets feeble imitation

Relentless [4x]

Wealth and power crashing through
Wealth impoeses its own views
Wealth and power crashing in
On the warpath, unrelenting
