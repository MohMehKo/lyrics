Why do what you do? Is this major malfunction new 
Isn't it clear to everyone here
What died deep inside 
Is benevolence now denied
What about pride was it cast aside

So when I see you friend companionship will come to an end
cause of the way you drove me to dismay. 

Force - force my hand - forced to take a hostile stand
force - force my hand - forced into a violent plan 
Never gonna want another like it 

Benefit me benefit you please benefit the whole damn world 
nobody needs your criminal greed couldn't you change - 
rearrange put your character back in place 
it's a waste to see someone so base
Guilt is put away for another day
conscience really non-existent only in the way
Lowest of the low 
caught in undertow swimming in a sea of dirt sinking as you go
Please don't do this...
