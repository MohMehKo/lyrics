Since the beginning there’s been a division not at all desired
Always standing in the way, so hard to push to the side
Hidden from the world of others, dwelling in the heart
Sad emotions that pervaded both the good and the bad times

DON’T LET IT WIN
Don’t let it break the love of kin
DON’T LET IT WIN
The dark division, the darkest sin

Making the best of it is such a challenge being ill at ease
Always learning how to act to preserve the honesty
True regret will earn respect and unite both sides
But division keeps resentment growing slowly over time

DON’T LET IT WIN
Don’t let it break the love of kin
DON’T LET IT WIN
The dark division, it’s time to break through the divide

Time to think, right the wrong, time to BREAK THROUGH THE DIVIDE
Time to think, right the wrong, time to BREAK THROUGH THE DIVIDE
Time to feel regret, forgive and forget, time to BREAK THROUGH THE DIVIDE
Time to neutralize, time to smooth it out, time to BREAK THROUGH THE DIVIDE
