Think of where you came from 
think about your past 
wouldn't you look ridiculous
selling out at last 
don't bite more than you can chew 
in the search for the perfect you 
don't bite more than you can chew 
you gotta be true, you gotta be true 
don't bite more than you can chew 
in the search for the perfect you 
don't be drastic, don't be drastic 
that could be me 
that could be you 
no one is immune 
cut some slack before you mock those
trying to improve 
we've all been there too
we always pull through 
we've got to learn humility 
we won't make the same mistakes
