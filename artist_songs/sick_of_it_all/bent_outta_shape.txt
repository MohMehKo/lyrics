The pressure’s building from deep inside
Judged in a way so unfair and blind
Done nothing wrong, done the right thing all along
Been written off as if guilty of a crime

Subject of hate
BENT OUTTA SHAPE
And reeling from that fucked up exchange
Subject of hate
BENT OUTTA SHAPE
Worked up, no longer down to work it out
Get it out
Get it out
Take that pressure off

Calling for exoneration
Out of nowhere quick knee-jerk reaction
And so it goes - The insults start to fly
Respect is pushed aside and no one does the right thing anymore

Subject of hate
BENT OUTTA SHAPE
And reeling from that fucked up exchange
Subject of hate
BENT OUTTA SHAPE
Worked up, no longer down to work it out
Get it out
Get it out
Take that pressure off, take it off

It’s but a name
It’s such a strain
It’s all too much to take
Now it’s time to break
Break oneself away
Time to just abandon
Let go of the burden
Allow no rules or self-induced confusion
Allow no fucking quarter
