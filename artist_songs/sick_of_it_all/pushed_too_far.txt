Push us too far, gotta fight back 
Push us too far, our turn to attack 
We gotta try, before it's too late 
Push us too far, you're choosing your own fate
Walking around, think you're so cool 
Beating up kids, weaker than you 
Tried to avoid you, kept on coming 
Pushed us too far, gotta do something 
This time you pushed us too far
