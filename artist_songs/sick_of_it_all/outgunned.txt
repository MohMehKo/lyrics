Dig in deep here it comes,
we're in this for the long run,
brace yourselves now and hold on tight
A target painted on our backs,
'cause we choose our own path
let it shine to separate us from everyone

ODDS STACKED AGAINST US
WE NEVER RUN
ALWAYS OUTNUMBERED
NEVER OUTGUNNED

Faced with challenge,
face with strife,
will we fall or stand up high
do we crumble underneath or rise above
Always on the outside,
castaway, written off
forever the underdog so bring it on

ODDS STACKED AGAINST US
WE NEVER RUN
ALWAYS OUTNUMBERED
NEVER OUTGUNNED

The world will test us, again and again
surmounting pressure
NEVER GIVE IN, NEVER GIVE IN
You get knocked down,
Get right back up
Always out numbered
NEVER OUTGUNNED

Dig in deep here it comes
The last stand, the defiant ones
Now's the time to rise and live or die like dogs
The odds are stacked against us
We never run, we never hide
Always out numbered
NEVER OUTGUNNED
