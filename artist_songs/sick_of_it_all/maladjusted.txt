Nothing satisfies, nothing will cause it won't get a chance to. 
Altered spirit and altered mind take a turn for the worst soon.
Fear has struck, fear is stuck maladjusted 
Assurance won't sit well at all cause no one is trusted 

You've got what you wanted 
the reason you came 
control the action control of the game 

See through the happiness, 
see through the sappiness 
See through the front that obscures all the truth
and see ugliness, torture, torture and ugliness 

Nothing satisfies, nothing will cause it won't get a chance to. 
Altered spirit and altered mind take a turn for the worst soon.
Fear has struck, fear is stuck maladjusted 
Assurance won't sit well at all cause no one is trusted 

See through the happiness, 
see through the sappiness 
See through the front that obscures all the truth
and see ugliness, torture, torture and ugliness 
Selfishness lost in a quagmire of human filth 

Fear has struck, fear is stuck Maladjusted 
Fear that rules a twisted fuck, Maladjusted
