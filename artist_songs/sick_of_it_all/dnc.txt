This serves as our protection
Long live the constitution

DNC / DNC / DNC / DNC
I'LL ALWAYS BE A THREAT
TO AN UNJUST GOVERNMENT
WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE A THREAT
TO THE HIGHEST POWER
Liberty or death

I, I live life a simple man
TRY existing in peace but
YOU'RE, you're always gunning for ME
Now can't you see that I
I don't buy into your GAME
Unwilling to play
I'll STAND, stand against all of the LIES
Yeah, I'll defy
Liberty or death

DNC / DNC / DNC / DNC
I'LL ALWAYS BE A THREAT
TO AN UNJUST GOVERNMENT
WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE A THREAT
TO THE HIGHEST POWER

FORCED under the GUN
nowhere to RUN
Seeing how laws always clash with the TRUTH
We are born FREE
Yearning for PEACE
Not as defenseless subjects
FORCED under the GUN
nowhere to RUN
Seeing how laws always clash with the TRUTH
We are born FREE
Yearning for PEACE
Which isn't where we're headed
It's all about total control
Long live the constitution
