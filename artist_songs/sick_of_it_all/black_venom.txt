Here they come, spewing hate
Warning of a terrible fate
Lies to sway your aggression
Quickly grab your attention
Find a scapegoat in your fears
Tell you what you want to hear
Pick a target, ostracize them
Paint them as our biggest problem

Poison our minds
The venom is flowing
Poison our minds
The power is growing
Blinding our sight
As they prey on our darkest fears

Preachers and clerics play this game
Twisting words of peace to hate
Pick a target, ostracize them
Fool the people to despise them

Poison our minds
The venom is flowing
Poison our minds
The power is growing
Blinding our sight
As they prey on our darkest fears

The black venom that drips from your tongue
Poisons the mind of the ignorant
They soak it up like a sponge
Those marked as scapegoats
Will suffer the wrath
Which plants the seeds of anger
And the lust for revenge
The black venom will seal our fate
And leave us drowning
In a world of fear and hate
