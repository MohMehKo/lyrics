Personality, suffer and enjoy it 
civility, most annoying habit 
isn't what I want, can't be what I want 
eating at me, it's eating at me 

Patience is a thorn in my side 
another thorn in my side 
feelings bottled up inside 
ready to suffer the consideration 

Another test, I grit my teeth and stand it 
try to ignore the most annoying habits 
isn't who I am, can't be who I am 
feel my decay, I feel my decay 

Patience is a thorn in my side 
another thorn in my side 
feelings bottled up inside 
ready to suffer the consideration

Nice, nice
patience is a fuckin' thorn in my side
Nice, nice
tolerance will stab at me 
but it's nice 
worn down, jerked around 
patience wears thin, painful stabbing
Stabbing stabbing
