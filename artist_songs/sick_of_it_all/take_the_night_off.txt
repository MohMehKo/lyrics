Brutal - the big picture is so cruel to us 
and everyone's life is such a tiny speck 
Some of the worst atrocities can pass, fifty miles away to no effect 

Power, power 
has always been abused 
work,debt, poverty, taxes 
life's oppressive rules 
Power, power 
just might never change 
No answers will come from our bloodthirsty ways 

Let's take the night off from mental stress 
let's take the night off - this world's a mess 

Captive - held captive by our hopes and dreams 
Our best intentions can destroy us 
We shouldn't grind ourselves away 
Take a break, we need to maintain 

Power, power 
has always been abused 
work,debt, poverty, taxes 
life's oppressive rules 
Power, power 
just might never change 
No answers will come from our bloodthirsty ways 

Commiserating has run it's course 
We'll save the world tomorrow 
We'll have to wait until that day 
We'll wait, we'll wait 
but in the meantime 
Let's celebrate the we don't give a fuck 
Let's celebrate that we don't care 
Let's celebrate that we don't give a fuck 
With a middle finger high in the air 
Let's celebrate that we don't give a fuck 
Take the night off, pass the buck
