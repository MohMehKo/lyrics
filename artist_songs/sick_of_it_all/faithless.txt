Don't count on government for your security
Don't count on any neighbour for their camaraderie

Forget it. forget about
The sense of ease you would wish for most
All the two-faced lies forming in their wicked throats
Oh. to break all the wicked molds
Formed in human life. by which we're surrounded

Faithless

Never underestimate stupidity of man
Get in the way - of his wretched plans
Never underestimate stupidity of man
Get in the way - of his wretched aftermath

Don't count on government for your security
Don't count on any neighbour for their camaraderie

They are flawed
Trust is a mistake
Even decent men mess what's on their plate
Subject to the urge
Written all over their face
Fallen decent men. victims of their nature

Faithless

The movers and shakers
Have me moving far away
The movers and shakers
Have me shaking my head

Never underestimate stupidity of man
Get in the way - of his wretched plans
Never underestimate stupidity of man
Get in the way - of his wretched aftermath

Don't count on government for your security
Don't count on any neighbour for their camaraderie
Comfort. friendship
Let them not be lost
