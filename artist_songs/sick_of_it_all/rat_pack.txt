You wanna jump me in the pack
Rat Pack, rat pack
My crew has got my back
Rat pack, rat pack
Been through this shit before
Rat pack, rat pack
Now you've got a fucking war
Rat pack, rat pack

I got my pride, glory's on my side
Yes, I got my pride, glory's on my side

See you alone you start to run
Rat pack, rat pack
Take your chances one on one
Rat pack, rat pack

I got my pride, glory's on my side
Oh yes, I got my pride, glory's on my side
