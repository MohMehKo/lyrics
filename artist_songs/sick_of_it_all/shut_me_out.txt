Pressure cooker about to explode 
the ignorant ones are litenin' to fools 
radical factions add fuel to the fire 
to satisfy their hateful desire 

We as the innocent suffer the most 
paying for crimes we did not commit 
here to serve penance for history's sins 
detested for something we've never been 

All their grandstands, all their big plans 
didn't change a damn thing 
how could you explain 
I don't know your pain 
understanding how you shut me out
trust - is lost - we'll gain it back 
give us the chance 
look in our past and what do you see
history of violence for centuries 
the truth isn't written in history's page
this is the source of frustration and rage 
we have no rights to ask for your trust 
to gain your acceptance we'll do what we must 
we'll make a stand for whatever's right 
we'll make a stand equal and tight 

Shut me out don't you 
shut me out don't you 
shut me out don't you 
shut me out
