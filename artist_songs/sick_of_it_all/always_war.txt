We're the one - we're the only
We're the best - end of story
Fly the flag - feel the glory
We'll avenge past injustices
Always

Always war - god's with the righteous. always war
Always war - god's will would give them hell
Always war - god's stands beside us. always war
Always war - it's god's will - so give 'em hell

We're the blind - we're the nameless
Give some worth - to the aimless
And always
Always war

Always war
Don't you want revenge
Always war
Don't you want your god given revenge?

We're the one - we're the only
We're the best - end of story
