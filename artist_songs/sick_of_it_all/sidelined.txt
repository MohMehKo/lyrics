When I was distracted
and tricked to look away
Cowering from menace
I would capitulate

ONE BY ONE,
My freedoms slipped away
ONE BY ONE,
My senses dulled

I was sidelined, SIDELINED
Easy to be cast aside, Incorrect to accept
this captive position
I was sidelined, SIDELINED
Easy to be cast aside, Incorrect to accept
the thin veil of national pride

When I let my guard down
I heard the demagogues
Cunning with their language
I joined up with the mob

ONE BY ONE, I fell for clever threats
ONE BY ONE, I danced with demons

I was sidelined, SIDELINED
Easy to be cast aside, Incorrect to accept
this captive position
I was sidelined, SIDELINED
Easy to be cast aside, Incorrect to accept
the thin veil of national pride,
but now I'm opening my eyes

TRUTH AND GUIDANCE, made clear by outright lies
TRUTH AND GUIDANCE, two things we've been denied

TRYING TO FIGHT OUT OF THIS PAPER BAG
Trying to find my way and take this country back
TRYING TO FIGHT OUT OF THIS PAPER BAG
Trying to figure out how to throw around these
undervalued hands
