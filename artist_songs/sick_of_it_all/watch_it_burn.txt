Head straight for the edge
Same mistakes again
Lessons never learned
Strike the match and watch it burn

Burn myself once again
I ride it out to the bitter end

It’s easy to ignore writing on the wall
Block out all concerned
Head for the crash and burn

Burn myself once again
I ride it out to the bitter end
When will I ever learn?
I strike the match and watch it burn

Good intentions pave the road
A one way street and we all know where it goes
I see the warnings and how this ends
I block it out and fail myself once again

Burn, burn myself once again
I ride it out to the bitter end
When will I ever learn?
I strike the match and watch it burn
I’ll watch it burn

I’LL WATCH IT BURN
A constant battle that never ends
Against the prison walls I put myself in
I’LL WATCH IT BURN
Under the pressure, I start to fold
As this demon tears away at my soul
I’LL WATCH IT BURN
I won’t go out, no not that way
I steel myself and live to fight another day
I’LL WATCH IT BURN

Burn, burn, I’ll strike the match and watch it burn
