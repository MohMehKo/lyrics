What's better for you is not better for me
Fuck this abuse. I'll give it right back
What's better for you is not better for me
Fuck this abuse. I'll give it back

Living with manipulative lies - evil schemer
Acting like dysfunction is alright
But my life needs none of this perpetrating style
Evil skeezer
Master of deflecting guilt and turning shit around

I never imagined complete control
Could take a hold of me with such subtlety

Everything's a power struggle now - evil schemer
Every day's a tug war somehow
But my life needs none of this disrespect and doubt
Evil skeezer
There's no trust so why waste time trying to work things out?

Save the drama - save the act - save the drama
Stop before I fuckin' crack

Fuck this abuse - I'll give it right back
Fuck this abuse - I'll give it back
