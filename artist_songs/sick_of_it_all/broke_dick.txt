Oooh
It's plain to see
Why there's no harmony.
Arrogance at a glance
A mind that's bent on ignorance.
Desperate for reverance
Little king with no respect.
Spitting out rhetoric from the mouth of a broke dick.
A blind approach that leads to misery
Bitterness will let you down, and shut you out
Bar-b-que broke dick.
