Another time another place
I might have had a smile on my face
This could have been such a beautiful thing
But now it's just a fucking waste of time
We've said what had to be said
The issue's discussed already dead
We're clinging to something
What we don't know
It's about time we just let go!

What's the point, why do we bother
Just to try and hurt each other
Or to try and save part of what was there
Put on an act pretend like we care
Avoiding the outcome we both know
Cut the shit and just let go!

All this back and forth
Cheap shots no remorse
No chance wounds to mend
When is this all gonna end
All i ever wanted was some fucking peace!
