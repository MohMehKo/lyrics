Return to reality Avoiding the treachery 
Return to reality Witness against the fools of the world 
playing a game so cruel 
how long before the lesson is learned
will it be understood 

Witness against the fools of the world
caught up in their own trap see how they look
so insecure just holding their weakness back 

Suddenly stripped of focus in life 
suddenly faced with loss 
hitting just like a slap in the face bringin' it down to earth 
Channeling this aggression, 
confused how will it manifest keeping the sanity
without just keeping it all repressed 

In the end what presents itself is the truth and the ugliness 
never seen when the eyes are closed or blinded... 
The effect of the file world amplified upon return 
and so tempted to play the game so malicious... 

Witness against the fools of the world playing a game 
so cruel how long before the lesson is learned 
will they ignore the words 
Witness against the fools of the world caught up in their own trap
see how they look so insecure Fakely hard in their own act
