No fear or concern
Ready to take on the world
Not playing it safe
Gonna change everything

So blind in youth
To all the hidden truths
Reality hits
And puts out the fire within

You’ve got to fight the rising tide
Don’t let it win, don’t let it win - HOLD ON
Snuffs out the spark of life you have inside
Don’t let it die, don’t let it die…

No fear or concern
Ready to take on the world
Not playing it safe
Gonna change everything

You’ve got to fight the rising tide
Don’t let it win, don’t let it win - HOLD ON
Snuffs out the spark of life you have inside
Don’t let it die, don’t let it die - STAY GOLD

No way, no how, no compromise
You choose the path you walk in life
No way, no how, no compromise
Don’t let the fire inside die out

Hold on to your anger
Keep it inside
It’s your lifeline
Never let it go, never let it go - NEVER

Hold on to your passion
Keep it alive
It’s your lifeline
Never let it go, never let it go…

No fear or concern
Ready to take on the world
Not playing it safe
Gonna change everything

So blind in youth
To all the hidden truths
Reality hits
And puts out the fire within

No way, no how, no compromise
You choose the path you walk in life
No way, no how, no compromise
Don’t let the fire inside die out
