No - I won't be silenced, I won't give in
No - to the pressure of what's hip 
No - this simple lesson must be learned 
No - won't candy coat it, must be heard 

Bury your head, hoping it all goes away 
living state of apathy 
don't wanna know 
don't wanna hear what goes on 
can't ignore there's something wrong 

No - don't have time for fantasies 
No - can't escape reality 
No - won't shut my eyes, won't look away
No - from the truth and the pain 

Bury your head, hoping it all goes away 
living state of apathy 
don't wanna know 
don't wanna hear what goes on
can't ignore there's something wrong 
you close your eyes, try to deny 
you look away to shut it all out 

We'll defy - the candy coated lies 
can't accept - pretending it's fine 
can't survive - with blinders on our eyes 
seek the truth - reach the sublime 
we'll defy - the candy coated lies 
can't accept - pretending it's fine 
open up your eyes 
it's too late 

See what's goin' on and recognize it's too late
time is running out, it's running out 
it's too late
take a stand and see what it's about 
it's too late
