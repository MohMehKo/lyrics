Yes! it's right feel indignation
Stand and be heard - uprising nation
Seize control from the undeserving
Let's make our move - uprising nation

All of the elite and the biggest money
Use fear to make us strangers in our country
Media is locked by the deepest pockets
These immoral plots have got to be. got to be. got to be stopped

Foolish thoughts of rapture in the government
Shouldn't be supported or even entertained
Foolish thoughts of rapture can only create
An imminent disaster that we all have to face

It's disappointing to see another war
Like we didn't lear from all our mistakes before
It's disappointing - the gullible mob
This is not a land of revolution anymore

Death to tyrants. death to tyrants. send them straight to hell

Yes! it's right feel indignation
Stand and be heard - uprising nation
Seize control from the undeserving
Let's make our move - uprising nation
Yes it's right. yes it's right
All this frustration
Stand and be heard - uprising nation
Don't be blind. don't be blind
Don't defend their selfish lies
Rise up. rise up. uprising nation
Rise up
