Here it is, once again,
Tales of betrayal by the ones we call our friends
Took us long to get where we are
Now we're told what we've done is wrong

We all started with something to say
Was it our different views or jealousy in the way
Now you're the ones setting the rules
Just like the establishment you're so against
Lay down your laws, say what you will
Tell me I'm wrong and I'll defy you

Who are you to make up rules and put us down?
With our friends, we'll stay to the end
And if it comes down to it, we'll stand alone

Here it is once again, tales of conformity
By the ones who would be king
We never set out to impress anyone
It's just an outlet, our chance to be heard
At first you said we hated to much
Now you say we just can't hate enough
Now you're screaming that we've changed
We've grown up but our beliefs are still the same
It's still an outlet for anger and strife
But one more thing, it's also our life

(We) We don't need any help (stand alone)
Our beliefs are strong enough to (stand alone)
Our desire's burning deep, in our hearts
It's in ourheads, it's in our souls
(We) We defy your fucking lies (stand alone)
You question our beliefs (stand alone)
Our desire's burning deep, in our hearts
It's in our heads, it's in our souls (stand alone) [x2]

People from the past, they don't want to hear us
The ones they call our peers, they just fear us
Ain't handin' no lies but reality comes off as cold
What you hear from me comes from deep down inside us
This just ain't a song of defiance,
I'm just tellin' you how it goes

We stand alone!
