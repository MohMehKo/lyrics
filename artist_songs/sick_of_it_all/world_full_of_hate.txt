Living in a time when no one cares or gives a shit, 
the world now cold and hard 
Senseless killing, no apparent reason
Suffer the greed of what the others got 
Anger and hatred, the tension's always there
There is no relief in sight for this world full of hate

Nobody cries as the innocent die and the guilty go free in this world - full of hate 
Struggle and strive just to live out our lives as we try to survive in this world - full of hate
Nobody cries as the innocent die and the guilty go free in this world - full of hate 
Struggle and strive just to live out our lives as we try to survive in this world - full of hate

Stand with me, disregard is all I see 
Keep to yourself sheltered for no one else
I've got no respect for a world that can't take care of it's own

Living in a time when no one cares 
Or gives a shit, the world now cold and hard
Senseless killing, no appearant reason 
Suffer the greed of what the others got 
Anger and hatred, the tensions always there
There's no relief in sight for this world full of hate

Nobody cries as the innocent die and the guilty go free in this world - full of hate 
Struggle and strive just to live out our lives as we try to survive in this world - full of hate
Nobody cries as the innocent die and the guilty go free in this world - full of hate 
Struggle and strive just to live out our lives as we try to survive in this world - full of hate
