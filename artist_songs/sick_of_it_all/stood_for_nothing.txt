Desperate Little You
We've seen the act and it won't do
Helpless Pathetic you
It's always something, It's always something

Stood For Nothing [x4]

Show some pride, show something
You got no heart, you got nothing
Help me stay true so I'll never be like you

Stood for Nothing [x4]
(you stood for nothing)

It's all good I still believe in myself, humanity
It's all good I still believe - that's the way it's gotta be

Stood For Nothing [x3] - Piss in the dirt
