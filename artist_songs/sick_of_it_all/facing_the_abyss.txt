Our mistake is to put faith into those who lead astray
The voice of the common man is not the voice of reason

I'm dismayed by the disdain
simple minds can show
Glory goes against the grain
Glory overthrows

Despairing masses, ALL FEAR THE SAME THING
Few can raise, STRENGTH FROM WITHIN
Facing the vacuum, FACING THE ABYSS
Few can face, losing belief like this

Talking heads and shady news
will only serve to confuse
Talk of free society
is also talk of treason

I'm betrayed by the disdain and it makes me wonder
If the glory's not engrained
When will we go under

Keep that direction
Stay on the course
No motivation offered
and no rewards
Stay self-reliant if ostracized
Exchange that mass approval for inner light

Despairing masses, ALL FEAR THE SAME THING
Few can raise, STRENGTH FROM WITHIN
Facing the vacuum, FACING THE ABYSS
Few can face,
Losing belief like this

LOSING BELIEF
