Further. whatever gets me
Higher. whatever gets me
Richer. whatever gets me
All of the power I need

Clawing. pushing. ceating. stealing. using?
It doesn't bother me
See it. want it. grab it. hold it. never let go and
It doesn't bother me

Dirty fighting. openly lying. always conniving
It doesn't bother me
Callous. brutal. barely human. cold and cruel and
It doesn't bother me

I am your leader
I am your leader
I can't wipe the smile from my face because you trust me
I can't wipe the smile from my face - I'm sure you envy your leader
No mercy. no pity. no sympathy
I've got what it takes

I've got your life and I've got your fuckin' money
