All roads lead the same direction
we all see eye to eye 
won't stand for a bad connection 
we came to keep things tight 
prove this, prove that 
proving is nothing 
let's all just be ourselves
focused with the right aggression
turn to each other for help 
people merge on state of mind from all
different walks of life 
don't need any more stupid division
don't need to feel uptight 

Brother - I'll always look out for you 
if I feel it back 
Sister - we'll brave the outside world 
off the beaten track 
When it's us vs. them
you can always count on me When it's us vs. them
it's a global unity 

Open the extended family 
the family is growing fast 
friendship will transcend the borders
the world is shrinking fast 
Cities merge on state of mind 
there's nothing wrong with that 
don't need any more stupid division 
don't fall for their trap 

Brother - I'll always look out for you 
if I feel it back 
Sister - we'll brave the outside world 
off the beaten track 
When it's us vs. them
you can always count on me When it's us vs. them
it's a global unity
