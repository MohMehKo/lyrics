Go to work, go to school 
Get an education, so you wont be a fool
Be a doctor, PHD, all that shit, that's not for me

All my life people tell what to say 
This is my life live it my own way 

Was so blind could not see 
figures of authority, always standing behind me,
ready to come down on me 

All my life people tell what to say 
This is my life live it my own way
