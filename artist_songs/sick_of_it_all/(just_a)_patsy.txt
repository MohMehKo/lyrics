Put defenses to rest 
when justice becomes moot
defy - let others follow suit 
to start the uprise is to start the war
paranoid conspiracies galore 

What's the point to maintain your innocence 
what's the point to play into their game 
what's the use to even try and sway 
pigs that are out to put you away 

Just a patsy played for a fool 
crooked games are what they're playing
lying, cheating, self defeating 
crooked games are what they're playing
accusations so demeaning, played for a fool 
crooked games are what they're playing 
lying, cheating, self defeating 
crooked games are what they're playing 
accusations forcing you to put defenses to rest
