If you want to save me leave me alone
With your sick polluted soul
If you want to save me leave me alone
The future's mine!

It's such a waste of precious time, precious years
Precious feelings that are misdirected
And should be disconnected
It's such a shame to learn a lesson
After giving of yourself in all so many ways
To find it didn't pay

If you want to save me leave me alone
With your sick polluted soul
If you want to save me leave me alone - now!

Don't want to compromise myself
Low self image hasn't got the best of confidence
At least not yet it hasn't
Only the least affected can be the most respected
Just to escape is worth the temporary pain and hurt

If you want to save me leave me alone
With your sick polluted soul
If you want to save me leave me alone
I've had enough this time
The future is mine!

My friends objectively
Told me again and again
About the things that 
I refused to see
