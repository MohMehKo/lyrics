Don't be a prick in the roses!
No one's impressed with your lack of respect!
We're all black sheep and we know it
So don't fuck it up for the rest!

So good, so far, it's been alright
Could we be more blessed?
It's sad to see aggression
So misguided, so misplaced
Hands up, throw down and blood will spill.
We're only human here.
It's worth a thought
Not to be a slave to human fault

Don't be a prick in the roses
No one's impressed with your lack of respect.
We're all black sheep and we know it
So don't fuck it up for the rest.

We swear we're here just for the fun
And to release the angst.
From this we feel we deal
Don't deprive us of that right.
Stand up to those who think they're king.
Let them know they're wrong.
Stand up for things that'll
Keep this action going strong.

Don't make a name for yourself
By stressing out everyone else
And don't bring your personal war
Through these doors.
Don't make a name for yourself
By stressing out everyone else
And don't bring your personal war
Through these doors.

Don't be a prick in the roses
No one's impressed with your lack of respect.
We're all black sheep and we know it
So don't fuck it up for the rest.
Don't be a prick in the roses
No one's impressed with your lack of respect.
We're all black sheep and we know it
So don't fuck it up.
Don't fuck it up for the rest.
