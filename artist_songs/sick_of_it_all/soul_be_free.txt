Soul be free.
Not chained in any way be petty jealousy
Soul be free.
Not bound in any way by selfishness or greed
The bounds that were formed over the years.
Suddenly so flimsy and weak
So did they ever exist?
I just watched as my life was criticized so I could
judge who had my happiness in mind.

My best interest isn't your best interest.
Count me out it I'm to serve you further.
My best interest isn't your best interest.
Let me out if it's that one-sided.
Let them do what they do and make a list.
Check it out and see what friends amount to shit.
I want the best for the souls that are close to me.
I won't stand in the way of their happiness.
I want the best for the souls that are dear to me.
I won't stand in the way of their freedom
Their calling, their destiny.
