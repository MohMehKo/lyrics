My principles, good sense
Got shut down by ignorance
Thought I made myself really clear
But couldn’t overcome the L.C.D.

That’s what I said, GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD
The plain truth speaks for itself
It’s common sense, GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD
Nothing else speaks for me, I won’t bend

Not gonna join in, I won’t partake
The party’s over in many ways
I feel despondent, I feel confused
Saw nonsense win and logic lose

That’s what I said, GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD
The plain truth speaks for itself
It’s common sense, GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD
Nothing else speaks for me, I won’t bend

Repetition’s useless
The concept never grasped
We keep going on, over and over again
The same argument

What’s so hard to figure out?
What’s so hard to accept?
We’re on a tightrope, shake and lose your step
If we fall, it’s the end

It’s common sense
C’mon and get it through that thick head
It’s the means to an end
Nothing else speaks for me
Nothing else, I won’t bend

My principles, good sense
Got shut down by ignorance
Thought I made myself really clear
But couldn’t overcome the L.C.D.
L… C… D. - L.C.D.
