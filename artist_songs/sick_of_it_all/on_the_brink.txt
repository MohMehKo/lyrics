When we're on the brink
We'd kill for something to happen
When we're on the brink
We'd kill for something to do

Another day, another night that seems like an eternity
Another day, another night that someone might
Turn this boredom around
See the drugs, see the violence and the pure stupidity
The bad will, the malicious kind of thrill
Keeps the boredom down

Another victim, another crime
Misadventure, a tragic use of idle time
Another victim, another crime
The excitement of straying from the straight line
