Whose voice is loudest? What do they say?
What earns them positions of authority?
No one’s got the answers - NOBODY RULES
No one’s more than human - NOBODY RULES

These ancient words echo so much
Why has the modern world not had enough?
No one’s got the answers - NOBODY RULES
No one’s more than human - NOBODY RULES

Don’t pay filthy people to give praise
No one’s filthy hands wash clean
Don’t pay to be a slave

Don’t give these mortal words eternal life
Question every angle and possible side
No one’s got the answers - NOBODY RULES
No one’s more than human and NOBODY RULES

The killing fields speak for us
We value words before we value life
And we’re so willing and eager
The killing fields show what we’re made of
Where our conceit and cruelty converge
And we’ll stop at nothing

Pity, such a pity, how deadly simple words can be
People misguided, nearsighted, can be molded like clay
Pity, we can’t break free, this prison of the mind
It’s the fucking blind leading the blind

Bullshit righteous - NOBODY RULES
How dare they act so pious? - NOBODY RULES
No one’s got the answers - NOBODY RULES
No one’s more than human and NOBODY RULES
