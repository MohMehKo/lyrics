There it is
The smiling face, the kind expression
Bringing hope to the demoralized
GOOD COP
Could there be a useful change
A better future
Is it just a clever power game
GOOD COP

CHANGE ISN’T IN THE AIR
JUST IN WHAT WE HEAR
Still held down, but never fear
Least the bad one’s history
The good cop is here

Working for the same old man
Doing his bidding in his interests
For his heartless plans
GOOD COP
If you’re tempted to believe
Caught up in it, drink the kool-aid
You’ll also be deceived
GOOD COP

CHANGE ISN’T IN THE AIR
JUST IN WHAT WE HEAR
Still held down, but never fear
Least the bad one’s history
The good cop is here

A ruse, a hoax, a trojan horse
It’s the old guard with a new look
They’ve made good cop man of the hour
They won’t ever let go of power

Out of the fire that came before
We’re back in the frying pan once more
