Don't you jump in, it's not your fight
Your ideas mean shit to me
You ain't on my side

It's my revenge, it's my revenge

One last resort, my broken back
I have a reason and a cause to fight back

It's my revenge, it's my revenge

I won't stand for it anymore, you know my time has come
Gonna see some changes, won't stop 'till I've won

It's my revenge, it's my revenge
It's my revenge, it's my revenge
