Stand still- nobody move.
Don't look around, you'll ruin the mood.
Progress- a dirty word.
Same old shit, safe and secure
Shut out, shut down don't want to hear it.
Please don't take it away.

Stubburn- set in my ways
A limited life don't want to change.
Slow down it's not time to go.
Don't want to leave my little world.
What makes us afraid of progress that is made?
To really understand you've got to free your mind.
Can't let us get stuck in a generic rut.

With a narrow view you've got to free your mind.
Consistency can be such a wonderful thing
As long as you are open and you free your mind.
