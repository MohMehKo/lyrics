Thinking back on what we had 
want to give in, want to give up
despair washes over you 
where do you go, what will you do 
your mind is racing in a million directions all at once 
where will you turn 
you're not in this all alone 
just look around, and you'll see
the answers right before your eyes 
I'm here for you, and you for me 
It's hard to open up, just try and you'll see
True friends will always be there

Thinking back on what we had 
all those times we shared 
all those times good and bad 
our growing friendship has formed a bond 
Never ending

You were there through it all, now it's my turn 
there's no doubt, good lookin' out 
when life's not fair 
True friends will always be there
