Fly by night scenester, Fly by night hipster 
One more newjack wants to set the rules 
Fly by night scenester, Fly by night hipster 

Never suffered, never paid the dues living contradiction, 
live a lie oh so fashionable what a goddamn pitiful sight it must
be a great thing knowing it all spreading nausea with a brazen show of gall

Who sets the rules 
The snobby fools 
Who sets the rules 

The fascist who wants to rule 
Living independent what a joke those caught dipping in a trust fund won't go
broke all this rhetoric is so hard to bear when the fool assumes a high and mighty air
People come and go, only some can really know who is laughable 
who should be on a pedestal. 

Trendy we'll see in the future what'll be, who is obsolete 
The one who takes it to extremes.
