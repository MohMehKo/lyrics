Where'd go, how'd pass, when did we lose it
that was us, yesterday, runnin' 'round care free
never thought it would end, never thought about time
now we stand, stand alone, not by choice, by fate

In my mind I can see visions of what used to be
all the fun, the suffering, was it just for memories
as I reach out for my past, it disappears
the pain will last
anger builds, I'm holding on
it slips away / and / now / it's / gone

Tighter than family, nothing could get in
all but time, wore away, things went by too fast
ideals change, people change, friends are gone moved on
some of us, drift apart, and those hurt the most
