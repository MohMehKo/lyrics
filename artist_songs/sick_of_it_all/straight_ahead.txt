All the things you want
all the things you need
you got the power to choose
you got the right to be all the things you loathe
all the things you hate is what you will become
until you will go straight
all the things denied
the shit you can't believe
you don't blame your self you
blame society
all the things in life
that you've been waiting for
wait outside your door
All your problems won't go away
I guess this is the price you pay
your decisions you will soon regret
throw away your life
go straight ahead
I see you everyday wasting your time away
you got no respect
got nothing good to say
all the things you loathe
all the things you hate
see what you will become unless you will go straight
all the things in life
all that you wanna be
but you don't even try
you want it all for free
all the things in life that you've been waiting for wait outside your door
