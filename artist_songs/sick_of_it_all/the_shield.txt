Lowered my shield, lowered - defenses 
Happier now feeling - all senses 
Heighten my soul and my - awereness
Isn't it great being - defendeless 
A long time ago I was - protected 
The choice was mine and I - selected 
The joy and the pain were - connected 
Lowered my shield, now I'm not protected 

I never used to let it down
Never used to let it down 
I never used to let it down 
Never used to let it 
There's something I've got to see 
I never used to let it down 
Never used to let it down 
I never used to let it down 
Never used to let it 
I've got to see what's really inside of me

Now I understand that emotion 
Now I understand why there's commotion
All this time without - a notion 
All this time without - devotion 
Why waste time being - suspicious 
Come taste life it's - delicious 
Expose yourself to the - malicious 
Expose yourself, they're - so vicious 

All these years
will this shield disappear 
And will I stand
a stronger man
no shield in hand
I'll have to overcome the pain the best that I can
