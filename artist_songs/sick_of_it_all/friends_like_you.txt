Call me a friend but you stab me in the back
You pretend we get along it's all just an act
You always use people to get what you need
You take advantage of others to satisfy your greed

We don't need you, you fuckin' scum
Hope that friends like you will never come
When things turn bad for you don't count on me
Cause I'll turn my back on you as you did to me

We don't need friends like you!
We don't need friends like you!
We don't need friends like you!
We don't need friends like you!

Call me a friend but you stab me in the back
You pretend we get along it's all just an act
You always use people to get what you need
You take advantage of others to satisfy your greed

We don't need you, you fuckin' scum
Hope that friends like you will never come
