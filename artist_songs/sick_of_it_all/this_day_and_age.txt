A dog that has no heart
A dog that shows no heart
This day and age
That dog will have his day.
The ones who take your money
The faceless and the cunning. This day and age
We're all such easy prey.
They aren't worth the money that they earn
They don't deserve the money that they earn.
You fit the demographic
If cash burns a hole in your pocket.
This day and age the con men Have it made.
Dollar [5x]
Check the flavor hear me holler.
This day and age
Respect is what you're paid.
They aren't worth the money that they earn
They don't deserve the money that they earn.
Hey, hey don't support the over paid and
Please say what you think about them when your face to face
Pick your battles carefully and
Don't waste money that'll speak for you.
It's the voice that speaks the loudest in this day and age. 
They aren't worth the money that they earn
They don't deserve the money that they earn.
