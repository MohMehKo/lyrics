Living in this world that's full of hate 
I just try to keep to myself 
People gonna fuck with you anyway
They just can't leave you alone 
Giving you advice you don't wanna hear
Like their lives are so great 

All of their lies filled me with anger and hate 
There's always someone watching every move you make

Living in this world that's full of fools 
I just try to keep to myself 
People always throwing their opinions at you
Makes it hard to see things clear 
Just remember that in the end 
The final decision is up to you 

All of their lies filled me with anger and hate 
They had their greed and their dictations
I'm content to live a life in solitude
All I wanna be is left alone 
Disappointment was all you got from me 
All I wanna be is left alone 
All I wanna be is left alone 
All I wanna be is left alone
