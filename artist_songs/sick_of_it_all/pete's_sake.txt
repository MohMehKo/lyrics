I don't fucking understand you 
You always tell me to think for myself
But when I disagree with what you say 
You turn around and put me down 
I don't know why you have to play
These high and mighty power trip games

Your double standards are pissing me off 
You've got a set of rules for you and another for us
You're no better, you're no worse 
But it's time you stop acting like a fucking jerk

I don't fucking understand you 
You always tell me to think for myself
But when I disagree with what you say 
You turn around and put me down 
I don't know why you have to play 
These high and mighty power trip games
I really wish you would quit 
'Cause we know you're full of shit
