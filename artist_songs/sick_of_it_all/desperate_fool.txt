Crime, crime against the soul 
it does more damage than anyone
can know as the victims suffer, 
the secrets that they hold will eat away inside them 'till they finally explode. 

Desperate fool - unforgivable - We're gonna do away with you 
Desperate fool - unforgivable - Your kind won't stand a chance you call yourself a man? 
Let's leave your fate up to those who've been raped. 
You impose yourself a lot no means no, 
you don't know when to stop it's body, 
it's soul it's all humanity that's what's violated can't you see you're really hated 
Step up the plate you challenge fate you've earned a castration 
you're face to face with your victims rage you deserve this laceration
