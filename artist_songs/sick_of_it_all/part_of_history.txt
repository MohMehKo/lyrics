The greatest scam of all
Official tricks
can't change what we saw

Rats are in control
With no moral code
Now they have shown
They would gladly

EAT THEIR OWN

So much was laid
to waste
We fell in line to trade
eye for an eye

Rats are in control
With no moral code
Now they have shown
They would gladly

EAT THEIR OWN

Devoid of wreckage that you'd expect
A bogus premise made plausible to everyone

I've got to hand it to the fucking rats
EVERYONE'S BEEN SUCKERED
EVERYONE'S BEEN SOLD
And now it's part of history

Dark agendas are imposed
Shameful truths not exposed
Now it's part of history,
it's a taboo
Now it's a nation's burden
