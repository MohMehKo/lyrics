It's Clobberin' Time(!)

Yeah
When will you learn
To face up to your mistakes
you thought you had me,
you thought it was something fun
You didn't realize
That the time would come
For you to take responsibility for your actions
You were the one who acted so wise
You were the one who dared me to cross the line
Your choice
You pay the price
You were the one, who acted so wise
Now you're the one whose gonna have to pay the price
When will you learn
To face up to your mistakes
you thought you had me,
you thought it was something fun
You didn't realize
That the time would come
For you to take responsibility for your actions
You were the one who acted so wise
Now you're the one whose gonna have to pay the fucking price
