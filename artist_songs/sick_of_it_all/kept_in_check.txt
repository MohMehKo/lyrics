Listen, we won't give up on our freedom
Even as we're beaten to submission
Even as they want achievements on their terms
Rulings to be followed to the letter

What a joke, it's to chaotic
There's no control
It's so chaotic
We reject their law

They've paid for these things before
And still nothing's different
They've paid for these things before
And still nothing's different

Pity we don't qualify as equal
Pity we're not worthy of the same rights
Even as humiliation keeps us down
Honor makes us want a better life

What a joke, it's so chaotic
There's no control
It's so chaotic
We reject their law

They've paid for these things before
And still nothing's different
They've paid for these things before
Nothing's different, not at all

We're desperate and lost, helpless
And they want respect from us, helpless
As we're kept in check, helpless
We're kept in a living death, helpless
