We gotta stand up and fight
All this oppression
It's time to organize,
AND GET BRONX
We've lost sight of our needs
Misplaced aggression
You gotta wake it up,
AND GET BRONX

Get ready and hold steady
Lock it down cause here it comes
We'll get ready and hold steady
the day of freedom has come undone

Poisoned by greed
And power
Don't bend
To power
Set yourself free

We gotta stand up and fight,
All this oppression
It's time to organize,
AND GET BRONX
Divide and conquer a means,
To hold their power
Freedom through unity,
WE'LL GET BRONX NOW

WE GOTTA STAND UP

STAND UP / GET BRONX / STAND UP / GET BRONX

Who's gonna stand with me - STAND UP
Who's gonna risk it all - GET BRONX
Bleed for freedoms sake - STAND UP
GET BRONX
We're responsible - STAND UP
We preserve the flame - GET BRONX
Fight for freedoms sake - STAND UP
GET BRONX
We gotta stand up,
Stand up now
GET BRONX
