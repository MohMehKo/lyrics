Hidden like the squalor that we create 
Martin wants out of this 
but poverty keeps him in this place 
Scratching like the vermin between the walls
Martin needs a friend but the people the he meets
just give him shit and pretend, they're no good 
he's not blind, all he needs is a single ray of light 

Life's too short but seems too long 
when loneliness becomes the norm 
life's too short but seems too long 
and it may come as no surprise 
but the loneliness in martin's eyes 
was good enough 
and life itself was long enough 

Knowing full well, knowing what's going on
knowing for far too long, jealous 
he's so jealous of all the fun 
Martin needs a friend 
but the pricks that he meets
just give him shit and pretend 
Long enough, life itself was long enough
had enough, he laid down when he had enough
