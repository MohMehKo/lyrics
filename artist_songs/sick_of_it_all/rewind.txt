I saw red for a second, so frustrated
I'm not immune to pressure
Thought I could control it, but I buckled
Lashing out for no good reason at all

Wish I could take it back, wish I could just rewind
Wish I could take it back and just not lose my head
Wish I could take it back, wish I could just rewind
Wish I could take it back and just not lose my mind

Words could not make up for the things so stupid
How futile is the effort
So I make this promise and I'll keep it
I'll never hurt the ones I cherish so much

I took it out on the wrong person
I feel pathetic, guilty, and weak

I took it out on the wrong person
I feel pathetic, guilty, and weak
