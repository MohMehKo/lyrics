I watch as innocence is slaughtered 
can't stop the ringing in my head 
you can't see what I see, you can't feel what I feel 
Guilty - the time will surely come 
guilty - when I pay a heavy price - guilty
I search for love but find oppression 
can't stop the ringing in my head 
you can't see what I see, you can't feel what I feel
just when I've fought out of the corner 
I find my back against the wall 
my rules are far too hard to live by, they beat me down from inside
Guilty - my standards are pathetic 
guilty - I fail myself again
