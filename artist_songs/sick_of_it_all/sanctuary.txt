This is for the one who saved me 
accepts me for who I am, just me
and always gives back tenfold whatever I give
Respect was never ever questioned, every feeling reciprocated 
mutual ideals and passion straight from the soul, from my soul 

When I'm safely in your arms there I find my sanctuary 
help me weather every storm, you're my sanctuary, my true love

There are those who tried to use you 
even ones who would abuse you 
they never took the time to see what I see
how you're always waiting for me kept me sane while all was crazy
and so I give you what's dearest to me, my true love

When I'm safely in your arms there I find my sanctuary 
help me weather every storm, you're my sanctuary, my true love

The very first time you touched my soul
from that day on never want to let you go
