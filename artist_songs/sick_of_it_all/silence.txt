So I take that you thought
Some things are better left unsaid
You chose your inhibitions
Over what I should comprehend
What could have been done
To keep me from going astray
Begging for direction
But not pointed out the way

Silence, silence doesn't teach
Silence, silence doesn't lead
Silence, where did I end up
In a self-destructive rut

Do I think I'm stronger because I learned my own way
I just think I'm lucky to have made it out unscathed
Now I'm thinking I resent the counsel that I lacked
All the words I didn't hear could have saved my past

Silence, silence doesn't teach
Silence, silence doesn't lead
Silence, where did I end up
In a self-destructive rut

Silence is deafening
You don't say
Silence is deafening

The corrupt light shines
The corrupt light blinds
Time to shrink, time to hide
Time to guard what's inside

The street didn't gently take me under their wing
The street is so dirty and I feel unclean
Silence is deafening when guidance is sought
Silence is deafening, and now I'm haunted
