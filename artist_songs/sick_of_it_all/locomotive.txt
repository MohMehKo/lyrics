Trapped in a rut and I can't get out 
Don't see a way to be free 
Working at it everyday nothing that I do 
Or say can break my poverty 
My desperate eyes will close tonight 
And I hope I won't feel a thing 
Cause I know tomorrow I'll continue 
With my sorrow 
And my desperate eyes will sting 

I don't understand, is it some kind of plan 
To keep us in our places 
No matter how we try, no matter how we strive 
We just can't seem to get ahead 

Same old stuff all over again 
But necessity keeps me here 
Every week that passes 
I'm gettin' weaker, faster 
I'm living in constant fear 
Suffering is at an all time high 
And they tell me I'm a lucky man 
If lucky is to suffer, then I wish it on another 
And I really don't give a damn 

Day in day out, feeling the grind 
Someway, somehow, gonna leave it behind day in day out, feeling the grind 
Someway, somehow, gonna leave it behind 
Day in day out, feeling the grind 
Someway, somehow, gonna leave it behind
