I've got to take control of the problem
Before it takes control over me
I've got to change the way that I'm seen
And that'll change the way that I'm seen

I'm searching for that comfort zone, inside my head
It's hard to find, but if I relax, I'll be rewarded

I've got to break these thoughts
And see that I'm a friend
Got to accept my humanity
Put this war to an end

Take control, it's not a prison to me
Take control, and I'm a free man from here
It's not fair, but I've been living my life in chains
My whole fucking life in chains
I know that I'm to blame

I've got to take control, take control
Take control over me
I've got to change my way, change my ways
Change the way that I'm seen

But now I've made it
Now I've made it
But now I've made the change
