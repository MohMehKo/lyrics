No more, no more
The cries of the ones you
Serve go unheard, ignored
With patronizing smiles you move on, and on
An agenda all your own
While the pain and scorn
Are yours and yours alone to stop

It's been said all before
But you choose to ignore
And the ones that you burn
Will be the ones to see you fall

You test the innocent and watch them bleed
You test the innocent, we'll watch you bleed

What's right, what's just
The lines of right and wrong have been
Blurred and crossed
So many times the ideals are lost
Your voices numb our minds
And those who oppose are cast
Into a light of doubt

There's only so much they'll take
Before your grip starts to break
As the cracks start to show
It falls apart and explodes

What's there left to say
As all hope fades away
Our cries fall on deaf ears
With no hope, no fear

Warned you a thousand times
You just ignored
And now the faceless ones
Will see you fall

You test the innocent and watch them bleed
You test the innocent, we'll watch you bleed
