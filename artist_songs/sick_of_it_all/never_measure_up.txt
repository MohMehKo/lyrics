No one can see you, no one can see
No one can sense humility 
No one can hear you, no one can hear
Inadequacy's in the air 

The greatest fear for you to be 
Exposed for all the world to see 

Never-measure-never-measure-never-measure 
Never-measure-up 

I know they see me, I know they see 
I know they sense humility 
I know they hear me, I know they hear
Now I face my greatest fear
