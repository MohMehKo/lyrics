Ready to take on the world with
youthful anger and rage 
armed with only innocence we stand
poised to make a change 
blissfully naive we charge 
leading in with the chin 
reality steps right up and knocks 
us down for an eight 
we might never change the world

At least we had our say 
the wheels' been set in motion as we
slowly chip away 

Growing up not, not growing old 
the feeling is still the same 
over the years we've seen our peers
get jaded and turn away 
the next generation's here
and we're ready to pick up the pace 
side by side we wave the flag 
of discontent in their face 

We might never change the world 
at least we had our say
the wheels' been set in motion as we
Slowly chip away - Away

But now's the time to make it right 
we stand defiant - We can't be silenced

We might never change the world 
at least we've had our say 
with the power of expression 
they can't take that away 
we might never change the world 
at least we've had our say
the wheels' been set in motion as we
slowly chip away - away
