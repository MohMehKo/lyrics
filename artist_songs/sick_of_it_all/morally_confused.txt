Morally confused 'cause I'm faced with the scum 
the scum that keeps my emotions numb 
fight with the images, I fight with my thoughts
suppress all the violence & keep backing off 
Am I still good if I want to see it 
am I still sane if I want to feel it 
The love in my heart ain't the answer to it
blood on my hands and morally confused 
I feel the pain that I inflict 
there's a lot of baggage that keeps building up 
baggage that's always annoying as fuck 
annoying reminders of how it is 
frustrating shit that'll never change 
I can't be bothered with problem solvers 
all sound alike, they're all pantomime 
I can't be bothered with problem solvers 
leave me to stew here alone in my fuckin juice
I don't know, I don't know what's right 
I can't shut these images out
