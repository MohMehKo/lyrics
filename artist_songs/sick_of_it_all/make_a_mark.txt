It's so hard to make a mark when you wash away
It's so hard to be remembered when you've got nothing to say
How could there be influence with quality in short supply?
Forced to watch this impotence. a dozen for a dime

When the frauds are on the rise we wanna see them fall
When the frauds are flying high we wanna see them crawl
Never did pay any dues - they've got a lot to learn
When they come down with a crash we wanna see them burn

How can we deeply moved by their shallow words?
The message is expendable. cheap and mass produced
How could there be influence with quality in short supply?
Forced to watch this impotence. a dozen for a dime

Better enjoy success. cause it won't last
That kind of ego is just good for a laugh

The money machine will make it grow
Will hit a nerve and make it gold
If they have it to jam it down
Jam it down your throat
Jam it down your throat
It's so hard to make a mark
Jam it down your throat
It's so hard to make a mark
Jam it down your throat
Till it succeeds

Where they do come from
What do they mean
Some random kids from some random scene
What do they stand for
What do they mean
What are they saying
Nothing. nothing
