Give respect, get it back, my solid promise
To this private pact, to this honored oath
I pledged never to let them
Push you over the edge
Straight edge or not don't matter to me
You can be what you want to be
In your actions give me proof
What's inside, the real truth

Pure is what you are when you're born
Be positive of what you're gonna be
Hard is the life that you're thrown into
Stick it out like my brothers and me

Extend your hand, call your friend
I'll stand with you to the end
Forget mistakes of the past
If you're friendship's true it will last
Straight edge or not don't matter to me
You can be what you want to be
In your actions give me proof
What's inside, the real truth

Pure is what you are when you're born
Be positive of what you're gonna be
Hard is the life that you're thrown into
Stick it out like my brothers and me
