It's right, you know it 
can't you see you're just fooling yourself 
it's here, reveal it - all the feelings just lead you to blow it 
something special is undeniably run of the mill 

Who is accepted, who to reject, who is neglected
who can make the choice 
who is admitted, who is denied, who can discern with the human eye 

It's wrong, you know it 
your gut should be telling you why
avoid it, discard it 
avoid it, put it aside, now

So who is accepted, who to reject v who is neglected 
who can make the choice
who is admitted, who is denied 
who can discern 
filled with human error

elusive answers stay just one step ahead
useless effort, always one step ahead
Think about it 
the more you learn, the less you know 
the more you learn, the less you know 
You know

The more you look, the less you find 
the more you look, the less you find
who can say they're satisfied 
who can say they've found the answers
elusive answers stay just one step ahead
