He stares back, he glares back at the eye of the vicious storm 
he's holding on defiantly 'cause he won't give up his decency 
not sucked in by evil nonsense 
not weighted by a guilty conscience 
The quiet man leads a quiet life hoping for the day he sees the light 
his reticence was heaven sent and everywhere he turned 
he saw the ways of the world and they were hell bent 
he kept his virtue to himself 
peace of mind is a fleeting thing 
and he's not sure when he comes across it
peace of mind is a fleeting thing 
at least sometimes he can enjoy it, that's more than they can say 
'cause they don't change their evil ways more than they can say 
'cause they're trapped in the storm they created 
the quiet man could say he's seen so many lives decay
but he chose to never spread his word 
so when he's gone his virtue fades away
