There's only dirty money in this system we extol
Can we live with it?
How long 'till it implodes?
And our selfish wicked ways lavishly provide
For ourselves
A shameless love of wealth
On our bed of roses we wear a crown of thorns
We toss and turn and still want more

NICE AND STUFFED BUT STILL CAN'T GET ENOUGH
Living in the rat race, desperate for the cheese
NICE AND STUFFED BUT STILL CAN'T GET ENOUGH
Pushing through the rat race, rewarded for our greed
NICE AND STUFFED BUT STILL CAN'T GET ENOUGH
Urged to keep morality from getting in the way of the dream

We snatch at dirty money
Just as soon as it appears
Can we live with it?
We know that it's unclean
And our selfish wicked way places all the blame on ourselves
Cause we all play the game
They say "more money, more problems"
Even though we see it's a pretty good fix
Tortured by human aspirations
What we want
What we need
What's beyond
And in-between

NICE AND STUFFED BUT STILL CAN'T GET ENOUGH
Living in the rat race, desperate for the cheese
NICE AND STUFFED BUT STILL CAN'T GET ENOUGH
Pushing through the rat race, rewarded for our greed
WOAH-OH, WE'RE UNDER ITS CONTROL
The dirty money system rules the world
WOAH-OH, WE'RE UNDER ITS CONTROL
The dirty money system rules the world

WOAH-OH, WE'RE UNDER ITS CONTROL
The dirty money system rules the world
