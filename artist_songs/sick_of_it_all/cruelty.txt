Standing on the top of the world [4x]
Standing on the top of the world
Standing on the top of the world
Standing on the top it's a long way down.
It's too easy to feel conceit
Its too easy to feel elite
The propaganda that you're fed.
Don't think you can count on it
When you judge yourself.
Supremacy means there's no conscience here
Supremacy means there's no compassion here.
Tradition rules
Despite the rotten truth.
Despite the atrophy
Despite the waste and greed.
It's too easy to feel conceit
Its too easy to feel elite
The propaganda that you're fed.
Don't think you can count on it
When you judge yourself.
It's a risky thought reinforced from youth.
Everything's a resource that's fit for abuse.
Tradition rules in the hearts of stubborn fools
Tradition rules no matter how cruel.
It's just their arrogance
Arrogance that fuels their cruelty.
Arrogance
Arrogance that fuels their cruelty.
Arrogance is stupidity
When its surrounded in our frailty
Arrogance is stupidity
When its surrounded in our frailty
Knock them down, knock them down
