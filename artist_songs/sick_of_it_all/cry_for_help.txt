Find a fault!
Cut it down!
Criticize everything.
What may be
Wrongly seen
As a show of strength may be a
Cry for help!
Cry for help!
Cry for help!
Cry for help!

Cold and calm
Out of reach
Distant eyes, secret life.
What may be wrongly seen
As a show of strength is just unexitable
Far too fucking cool.
Unexitable
Feigning control with detachment.

Cry for help!
Cry for help!
Cry for help!
Cry for help!
Don't turn away it's a cry for help
Don't turn away it's a cry for help
Pride doesn't heal the pain that's felt.
A cry for help!
