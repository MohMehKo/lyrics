Disconnect, Disconnect your flesh

SEE YOU AROUND, WHEN YOU'RE DONE ZONING OUT
Busy with the bullshit,
When life is interrupted
SEE YOU AROUND, YOUR HEAD IS IN THE CLOUDS
Into the oblivion, and life is disconnected

Collective breakaway
Collective breakout
Fake wants, fake needs,
A fake obsession

The need to be involved,
The validation
A claim for fame,
From victims of the modern age

Disconnect, Disconnect your flesh

SEE YOU AROUND, WHEN YOU'RE DONE ZONING OUT
Busy with the bullshit, When life is interrupted
SEE YOU AROUND, YOUR HEAD IS IN THE CLOUDS
Into the oblivion, and life is disconnected

Adventure put on hold, Just going nowhere
Timing is in, another measure

The years will not return, For any replay
You say: "OK, Just keep that fleshiness away"

Disconnect, Severed, Disconnect

Disconnect from the boring material realm
It's an escape, a retreat, pulling back in a shell
Disconnect from your presence, your body and soul
It's an escape,
an escape from what's weighing you down
Time to disconnect your flesh
