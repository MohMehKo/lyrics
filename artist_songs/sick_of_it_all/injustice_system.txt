Freedom, a right I thought we had 
One that no one could take away 
But there are those who will try 
To rule the lives that you and I choose to lead

We must fight - injustice system 
Have no rights - injustice system 
We must fight - injustice system 
Have no rights - injustice system 

There are those who change the laws 
For gain and furthering their needs 
A small group possess the power 
A minority dictating what's good for the majority
Money has the real influence 
Without it what we say don't make a difference
I'm not telling you to give in 
But to me there's got to be a better way to fight for our rights
And to have our say 
To choose for ourselves 
And not be led around blindly on a short leash

We must fight - injustice system 
Have no rights - injustice system 
We must fight - injustice system 
Have no rights - injustice system

Freedom, a right I'll always have 
One that no one can take away 
No matter what it is they try 
Because the flame of freedom burns deep down inside of me
