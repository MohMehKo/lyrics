Hard times, is what we're in
and it ain't getting any easier my friends 
friends, search for the easy way out 
and they don't care how it comes about 
youth, they just wanna get paid 
they don't wanna end up working like slaves 
slavin', for nickels and dimes 
so they turn to the quick money of crime

Morals are gone, no respect for human life 
but what was it that you'd expect 
take a look around at this world we live in
tell me you wouldn't grow up cold and callous 
prejudice, is one of their tools 
and we fell for it like a pack of fools
fools, is what we are 
we follow their plans to the letter so far
each other, at the other's throat 
they sit back, to them it's all a joke 
joke, but now the joke is on them 
they can't deal with this generation so violent

We stand accused of the crimes 
the crimes that take place 
they point the finger 
but they're the ones that set the pace
they beat you down, to try to keep you in your place
they were the ones, they were the ones 
they were the ones that taught me to hate
