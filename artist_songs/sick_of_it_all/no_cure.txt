No cure, no end in sight
No cure for poisoned minds
No change, no change, after all this talk still living foul
Ignorant, Ignorant, you think we would've learned by now
Over and over same mistakes as before
No end, no end, look around no end in sight

When the damage done is to extensive
Everyone ignores consequences

Hatred, hatred, the only thing we give ourselves
Heartless, heartless, no regard for anyone else
Sickening, sickening, the way that greed rules our lives
No cure, no cure, for the disease called mankind

Look deep inside - for the cure to what ails mankind
Look deep inside - we've got to live a more righteous life
Look deep inside - can't change the world
but you can change yourself...
