Tough times will erode our conditioned, frail souls
Tough times will erode our conditioned, frail souls

This erosion will always be
An unwelcome reality
What's ahead is cut and dry
Looming like a blackened sky

How do you fight a losing war
The single encouragement is damage control
How do you fight a losing war
Improvise in trying times
Bending the rules

Tough times will erode our conditioned, frail souls
Tough times will erode our conditioned, frail souls

Wear erosion like a badge
Tune out the lousy effect it's had
An ironic victory
Consolation's bittersweet

How do you fight a losing war
The single encouragement is damage control
How do you fight a losing war
Improvise in trying times
Bending the rules as you go

What's been keeping us going this far,
These times

These moments,
The good life,
Remembrance, in tough times

What's been keeping us 'round this long,
These times

These moments,
The good life
Remembrance, in tough times
