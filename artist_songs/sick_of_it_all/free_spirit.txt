We've taken to much for granted 
the basis that some are denied 
some choose to ignore this right while others would give up their lives. 
For the chance to voice their opinions through all of the torture and crime 
lies and deception won't change the direction of will in it's fight to survive 
Freedom, not free, freedom

Even when kept in restraint the spirit continues to thrive 
lies and deception won't change the direction of will 
in it's fight to survive 

Figures of oppression breathing down our necks 
Free spirit continues to thrive 
Free spirit in the face of denial this oppression, 
the depression answer it with indignation
