Growing anger fills my head

Always trying to make things better
make things better with fantasy
Open your eyes and you'll see better 
see it's up to you and me

Make an effort, do what you can
anything's better than sitting on your ass
Sing a song, scream and shout
hoping that someone here is down

Always trying to make things better
make things better with fantasy
Open your eyes and you'll see better
see it's up to you and me
To fight for all the things we believe in 

Always trying to make things better

Open your eyes and you'll see better
see it's up to you and me
To fight for all the things we believe in
