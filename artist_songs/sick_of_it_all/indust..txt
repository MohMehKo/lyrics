Locked out, and alienated 
lost, soul, is feared and hated 
judged, scared, not comprehended 
waste, time, no more 

Everyone's responsible to take precaution - be aware 
research is our best defense 
if we ignore it we'll just fool ourselves

Your, lies, and misconception 
won't, help, in their affliction 
learn, know, what's fact or fiction
waste, time, no more 

There's no more time for talk, we've got to see 
the reality that surrounds us every day 
we can't ignore all the victims of the plague 
who've been fighting for a future 
that's looking pretty, pretty vague 
we can't deny it, we can deny it 
it just ain't right if we turn a blind eye
the truth will upset all of those 
who will let this apathy run their live, 'cause:

Silence equals death 
silence equals death 
silence equals death
