Can’t wait to fail. Can’t wait to quit.
Can’t wait to give up on any chance of greatness.
Where is the game? Where is the brick?
Where is the shred of anything respectable?

This could have been the time
This could have been the day
Where destiny meets history.
They chose the wrong day.

Can’t wait to fail. Can’t wait to quit.
Can’t wait to give up on any chance of greatness.
Where is the potential? Show me the heart.
Without the action, there’s no room for laziness.

This could have been the time.
This could have been the day
where destiny meets history.
They chose the wrong day.

They can’t wait to quit – just to give up and go.
Can’t show any pride cause there’s nothing to show.
They admit defeat cause it’s all that they know.
They can’t wait – wait to fail [x2]
Life by numbers.
