Always looking,
Always waiting anticipating
Fickle and jaded sometimes
Sloppy working the body
The pressure is in my head 
I won't falter

The hell with meeting expectations
Proudly displaying imperfections
Sometimes sloppy
Working the body
The pressure is in my head
I won't falter

It won't be the end of me 'cause
I won't let it get to me!
It won't be the end of me 'cause
I won't let it get to me!
It won't be the end of me 'cause
I won't let it get to me!
It won't be the end of me 'cause
I won't let it get to me!
