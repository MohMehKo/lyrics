Another cause, heed the call, everybody rally 'round
don't contemplate if it's right, just follow the crowd
but don't you dare disagree
'cause they'll question your loyalty
their idea of comraderie is to heed their call to arms
who appointed you the moral judge?
pointing your fingers at everyone
don't pull that guilt trip bullshit on me
nothing you say or do can decide for me
so go ahead, keep your rules, I'll choose my own wars
your accusations and harsh words can't do me any harm
'cause I don't believe in blind loyalty
that's just mob mentality
I will answer what's right for me
and not your call to arms
