We'll be waiting sixty years for the truth
Sixty years for the proof
Who of us will be around in
TWENTY SIXTY ONE

Trust is what we do without
A nation's honor put in doubt
It won't likely be absolved in
TWENTY SIXTY ONE

Names will not be named
Judgements won't be made
We can be assured
JUSTICE WON'T BE SERVED

No one wants to believe that they're
easily dispatched
No one wants to admit
they saw society collapse
Revolutions of evil will
worked to great effect
Devious new mind control
Turned the whole world on its head

We'll be waiting sixty years for the truth
Sixty years for the proof
Who of us will be around in
TWENTY SIXTY ONE

But they'll keep it from the light
Never to declassify
Keep the feast of blood alive past
TWENTY SIXTY ONE

Names will not be named
Judgements won't be made
We can be assured
JUSTICE WILL NEVER BE SERVED
