You're always screaming about unity
being open minded and honesty
What you might say will some people believe
but i really doubt your sincerity

If we really want this deal to work out,
we all got to rise above, we've got to stop
these petty arguments, don't you think it's time to cut the shit out

You're always screaming about unity
being open minded and honesty
If we really want it, we all gotta try
stop takin' behind eachother's backs
and spreading a bunch of lies

I ain't saying that i got a master plan
I ain't telling you to go out and hold eachother's hands
just saying that we're tired of hearing your shit 
and if you don't mean what you say then don't say it
