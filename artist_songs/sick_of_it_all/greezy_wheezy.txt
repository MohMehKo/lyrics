Grain whiskey on my breath 
baby left ain't feeling my best
slap of pork, can of greeze 
could've been a worthy champeen
wheezy let it bleed wheezy let it bleed 
wheezy let it bleed greazy wheezy 
grain whiskey soaks my brain 
shickhaus baby ease the pain 
roll of nickles on the back of my neck
shit in your sisters fuck let it bleed
