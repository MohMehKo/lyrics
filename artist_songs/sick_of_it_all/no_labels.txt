Open your eyes and you will see 
You've got a life, look at me 
Can't they do what they say 
Live your live in your own way 

No labels, no lies 
No fronts to hide behind
No labels, no lies 
No bullshit to hide behind 

....

No labels, no lies 
No fronts to hide behind
No labels, no lies 
No bullshit to hide behind

Open your eyes and you will see 
You've got a life, look at me 
Can't they do what they say 
Live your live in your own way 

No labels, no labels, no labels and no lies
