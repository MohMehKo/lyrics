Sometimes I don't want to know,
I don't want to know myself
Sometimes I don't want to love
cause I don't feel it for myself

How can I improve on something I don't know,
So come closer
Come closer, come closer, come closer
so I can drive you away

I'll manipulate the stupid game
with my own confusion
and I'll be bending all the fuckin' rules
with my own self doubt
and if I seem uncomfortable
do I seem uncomfortable
it's cause I am
My own mind
my peace is hard to find
secrecy in my mind
mysteries countless as the world outside
So come closer
Drive you away
