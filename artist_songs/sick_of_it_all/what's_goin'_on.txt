Does anybody realize what's goin' on
take a look around and you will see that we're destroying ourselves
does everybody out there have a chip on their shoulders 
or is it that we've got nothing, nothing better to do 

Beatings of five to one wasn't enough 
now we're using everything from chains 
to knives and guns 
how much more of this do we have to take 
before we realize it's such a senseless waste 

Does anybody out there hear the cries
of mothers who have lost their children 
to your foolish games 
when are you gonna realize
that it's all just, just a senseless waste

You think that it's just a game 
well, I've got one thing to explain 
someday your luck will fail 
then you'll wind up dead or jailed
