No matter what, I see what's real
Every imperfection is crystal clear
No matter what, I can't help but give a fuck
I can't be free and easy
I just don't work like that
I'm not like that

look into my eyes, it burns inside
when I view the world I see the lies
sometimes it can leave me hurt
the overly critical part takes over

No matter what, I see what's real
Every imperfection is crystal clear
No matter what, I can't help but give a fuck
I can't be free and easy
I just don't work like that
Like that, like that, not free and easy

Dumb me down so I can be happy
Dumb me down so I can be numb
Dumb me down 'cause I pick apart all my blessings
