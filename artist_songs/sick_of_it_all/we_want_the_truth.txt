Abused used the way we felt 
Dirt cheap the way you dealt 
Talk talk nothing's said 
Speeches promises don't mean a thing 
Empty words from your mouth 
Token actions gave you clout 
Time's now to end your luck 
No more talks cause we don't give a fuck 

About your alibis, about your lies 
and all your excuses 
Think we can't handle it 
Think we would cave in, why don't you try it 
No more stories, no more double talk 
and no more cover ups, we just want the truth! 

Abused used the way we felt 
Dirt cheap the way you dealt 
Talk talk nothing's said 
Speeches promises don't mean a thing 
Empty words from your mouth 
No one cares what it's about 
In the past give us proof 
No more talks, we just want the truth! 

And what about the youth 
Never told the truth 
Never told what it's all about 
It's all about the wealth 
There's no one there to help 
and everyone's looking out for themselves
Put our faith in you and our trust too 
Have you no conscience 
We know the story, it's money and glory 
Don't care who you step on 
No more speeches, no time for apologies 
We heard it all before 
All of your alibis, all about your lies 
and all your excuses 
Think we can't handle it 
Think we would cave in, think we can't take it
No more stories, no more double talk 
No more cover ups, we just want the truth!
