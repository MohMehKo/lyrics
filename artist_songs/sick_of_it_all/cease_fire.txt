I will never yield in my restoration won't look,
Won't look back though
I was torn to pieces nothing 
Will destroy my determination
I won't be surpressed my voice will now be heard

Cease fire
What did I say 
I didn't mean to blow the world away
Cease fire
What do you know my mouth 
Is like the barrel of a gun
Cease fire
What did I say, disarm

You're to cautious in the new day of this nation
it's so volatile words can cause an explosion so
I went to far so I shred up action
I had no idea the end would come so easy

Cease fire
What did I say 
I didn't mean to blow the world away
Cease fire
What do you know my mouth 
Is like the barrel of a gun
Cease fire
What did I say, disarm

Disarm, disarm, we're too far gone, we're to far gone
Someone please put out the flames
Yeah I know it's me to blame
Arrogance will never pay
Cease fire!
