All foreign feet down Oxford Street
Faces from places I've never been
All the shops and restaurants
Ask for money that I haven't got

It's just a fake make no mistake
A rip off me a new Rolls for them

Now you kids get to grips
Don't wanna buy or eat no more
Kings Road shopping makes us poor
Time is running out for us
