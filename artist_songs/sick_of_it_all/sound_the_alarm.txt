Listen! Oh you've heard it before
As they tighten the noose we still ignore
The truth, the proof as freedom dies
Or are we just being paranoid

THINK WE'RE SAFE
SAFE FROM HARM
STAND UP NOW
SOUND THE ALARM

Won't see the truth or open your eyes
Spent your whole life caught in their lies
Keep your nose clean, live by their laws
What will you do when they kick in your door
WHO WILL SAVE YOU

Comfort is what we crave
The truth is disturbing vile and brave
Chastise the ones who bring it to light
With your head in the sand you wait to die

THINK WE'RE SAFE
SAFE FROM HARM
STAND UP NOW
SOUND THE ALARM

Won't see the truth or open your eyes
Spent your whole life caught in their lies
Keep your nose clean, live by their laws
What will you do when they kick in your door
WHO WILL SAVE YOU WHO WILL SAVE YOU NOW

WAKE UP, We're all fighting to get by
WAKE UP, Locked in place and kept blind
WAKE UP, Break the hold break the norm
WAKE UP, Stand and fight sound the alarm

WHO WILL SAVE YOU NOW?
