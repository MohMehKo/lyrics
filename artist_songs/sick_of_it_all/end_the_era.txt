Should be the end of an era 
an era of control 
that keeps minds lost in their identity 

The power that exists alone, should be finished 
should be done 
the suffocation can't go on
choke on the world while just 
Staring at the sun 
a spoon fed zombie can't be discerning one 
never had the chance to be the thoughtful one 
never had the chance to break from being numb 
once and for all 

End the era - let it go
End the era - of control 
End the era - turn it off 

Reach the ones who aren't lost 
should be the end of an era 
an era of monopoly 
should be stripped of all authority
monopoly exists alone 
should be buried 
should be gone 
a real effort never made 
to get a special kind of look or thought or trait
the plain and obvious course is prearranged 
the opportunity to take the simple path 
without the knowledge that the straight - away
won't last, it just won't last 

End the era - let it go 
End the era - of control 
End the era - turn it off 
reach the ones who aren't lost
Let it go, let it go, turn it off
Reach the ones who aren't lost
