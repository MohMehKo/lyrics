My mouth,
Spouts these words of anger and spite
Toward the other man
I'm bent out of shape, I'm feeling irate
Feel that blood flow
The red thats in us all
Is confused with the black and white
The crowd's on its feet,
My message complete
Breed some hatred tonight

Save your insanity!
Use that for my needs
Bust them up now!

Rally your ignorant minds on my own
Take my knowledge
And breed the hate at home
The world wont be at peace
Until my brother's are alone

My mouth,
Spouts these words of anger and spite
Towards the devil man
The crowd's on its feet, my message complete
Breed some hatred tonight!
