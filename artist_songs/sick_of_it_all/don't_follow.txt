Thought enters your mind, something of a find 
too bad it's really trite and unoriginal 
this poor sap just wants to fit 
and couldn't give a shit 
if his actions stand 
for compromise 
wakes up, realizes too late
has to accept the fate of being 
the target to humiliate 

Givin' in control of your mind 
givin' in control of your life 
givin' in control of your mind 
givin' in control, better watch out

You could be handing your whole shit away 
better watch out 
nothing unique, just a pale imitation 

Don't follow, don't follow 
follow your instinct, follow what's right 
don't fall for fashion, don't fall for hype 
follow your viscera, follow your soul 
don't let the powers that be have control

Movements have the knack 
to give you what you lack 
too bad you joined the thought organization 
once you find yourself involved 
nothing's really solved 
mind control can do just what you let it

Givin' in control of your head 
givin' in control of your heart 
givin' in control of your head 
givin' in control, better watch out 

So much for cherishing what makes us different 
just watch out 
so much for cherishing what's so important 

Don't follow, don't follow 
follow your instinct, follow what's right
don't fall for fashion, don't fall for hype 
follow your viscera, follow your soul 
don't let the powers that be in control
