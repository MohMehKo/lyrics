Please don't be the sensitive one
Cause negative thruts are too damn funny
Don't freak out the words from my mouth
Are against everybody no one is singled out
Nobody's protected - nobody's safe

What stereotype is that
How can you help but laugh
Who's feelings are hurt again
This one with the thin skin
Who should learn to laugh at himself
At himself

Evil for yuks is never malicious
Just some bunk to raise the spirits
Every group and orientation
Is fair game for me to rip on
Thin skin - stay away
Nobody is safe

What stereotype is that
How can you help but laugh
Who's feelings are hurt again
This one with the thin skin
Who should learn to laugh at himself
And everybody else

Evil for yuks
Thin skin - you suck
Evil for yuks
Thin skin - you suck
