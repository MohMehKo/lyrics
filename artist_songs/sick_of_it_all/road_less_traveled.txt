It started on a Sunday five dollar matinee
that put us on our way, The road less traveled
All the friends we have made
and the families we have raised
all thanks and credit due, The road less traveled

We did not choose this, Passion drove us to it,
Hardcore is our life now
Born to walk on the road less traveled

Blood Sweat and not tears,
feast and famine thru the years
working hard keeps us here
On the road less traveled
Good or bad the choice is ours,
no one to put blame upon
take the gamble right or wrong,
On the road less traveled Down

Like those before us, breaking from the norm
Never fitting in, so we strike out on our own
Fight against the tide, go against the grain
Living every moment,
feeling all the joy and all the pain

Live your life, Live your life, Live your life
Make the choice to stand apart, Live your life
Push on thru and make a mark, Live your life
The only thing to fear is time, Live your life
Make the choice not just to live but truly be alive!

We did not choose this, Passion drove us to it,
Hardcore is our life now
Born to walk on the road less traveled

Were we right we will see
But you know our philosophy
"Be a doctor, PHDs, All that shit is not for me"
