My enemies lurk in the corner of my eye 
Falling apart 
Staring back from the dark shadows in my mind 
Falling apart 
My trust is like a crumbling statue 
Falling apart
I try to hide but find no refuge 
Falling apart 
They seem so threatening 
They all seem so threatening 
They're all coming after me 
The enemy's after me - that's a problem 
From what I see the land of the free is ready 
To arm me to the teeth - that's a problem 
We're free to cheat, free to steal 
Free to wreck each other at will 
They shock my chill, shock my senses
Never let down my defenses 
Kundalini's in a mess 
And I'm shattering from stress
They victimize, traumatize 
And I'm as vulnerable as a child
All the sounds I hear at night 
Is my alarm going off 
Are my windows shut and locked
As I fumble trough my keys 
You see me falling apart at the seams 
Falling apart 
The enemy's after me
