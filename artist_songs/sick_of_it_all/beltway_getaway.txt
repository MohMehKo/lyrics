Unaccountable - SCOT FREE
Your trouble is just our legacy
Unrepentant - SCOT FREE
A new world order is now unleashed

Where's the new foe
Where's the fall guy now

Who did we have to waste - BELTWAY
Who didn't know their place - GETAWAY
Who did we assassinate - BELTWAY
Boy those really were the days - GETAWAY

Not indicted - CARE FREE
We snubbed the world with our misdeeds
Not tormented - CARE FREE
Fulfilled, we laugh about the tears

Where's the new foe
Where's the fall guy now

You're high and dry
When our term is up
Up shit creek
and shit out of luck
