So rotten on the inside
In heart and soul and mind
So rotten on the inside
Guaranteed to die alone

Die alone - keep the money. keep it all
Die alone - a worthless pile of bones

So rotten on the inside
Where all the truth hides
The lie that's on the outside
Is worn like a disguise

Die alone - keep the money. keep it all
Die alone - a worthless pile of bones

So rotten on the inside - guaranteed to die alone
So rotten on the inside - guaranteed to die alone

There is no room left for things that we possess
There is no room to take it with you
The only thing left. emotion we possess
The feelings that would love or hate you

Die alone - die die
There is no room to take it with you
Die alone - die die
No one will care and none will mourn you
Die alone - die die
You have no room to take it with you
Die alone - die die
No one will mourn. they want to see you gone
They want to see you gone
Die alone
