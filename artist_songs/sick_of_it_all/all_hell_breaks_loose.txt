Walls start closing in around you 
My twins of evil 
They shake you by the collarbone 
Then snap you by the ribcage 

And broken bodies in a death rock dance hall 
Please be my partner 
Eyeballs pop, accelerated blood beat 
Veins a-shaking 

And all hell breaks loose 
Yeah, evil is as evil does and who 
Yeah, who but me could write this book of cruel 

I send my murdergram 
To all these monster kids 
It comes right back to me 
And it's signed in there parent's blood 

And all hell breaks loose 
Yeah, my heart is a-breaking loose 
Yeah, my whole world's breaking loose 
Yeah, and evil is as evil does ans who 
Yeah, but who but me could write this book of cruel 

I send my murdergram

Veins a-shaking 

And all hell breaks loose

I said my whole world's breaking loose 
Yeah, my whole world's breaking loose 
Yeah, my whole world's breaking loose 
Yeah, my whole world's breaking 
All hell breaks loose.
