From the day that you're born
they try to teach you right from wrong
put these ideas in your head
try to teach you good from bad
then they send you of to school
fill your head full of rules

it's all just lies what they said
just some shit to fill your head
they tell you to tell the truth
that's a lie in itself
it's all just lies what they said
just some shit to fill your head
don't ever ask them why
cause what they say it's all just lies
