A new direction, old approach
ideas are borrowed, bought and sold 
they take the credit, not the blame 
leading the blind in their game 
They want control with no truth 
the token phrases won't come thru 
Don't rest your hopes, on their backs
When their gone they won't look back 
They're on the outside and looking in 
for what can shape the latest trend 
they'll rape the substance with no return, and steal the credit not 
earned you think that we're the ones the ones who lost out when 
the rules were set to win at any cost we'll stand defiant, we'll stand alone 
Through years of disrespect that desecrates the soul 
The times are changing but not our minds 
The spirit strenghtens with the passing of time 
We'll stand defiant, we'll stand alone 
Through years of disrespect that desecrates the soul
