The pain strikes, the pain ascends 
Too much to comprehend 
Come down, remove the breath
Come down, remove what's left 
Loss of the will to live, the loss of everything

I know we'll say goodbye someday 
Goodbye said in an eternal way 
Too precious just to throw away 
It's a waste, such a waste, what a waste, you know
I can't believe it's happening 

The pain strikes, the pain's at hand 
Too much to understand 
Wind blow, remove the pain 
Wind blow, put out the flame 

You won't admit to the pain you've submit to 
You fight it every inch of the way 
You don't deserve this, it's such an injustice
Just watching you slip away 

You on the other hand - pathetic i reprimand 
You for all the things you believe 
Nobody wants to know what you're up to
When all you want to do is deceive
