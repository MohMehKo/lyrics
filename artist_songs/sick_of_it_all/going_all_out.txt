Right now, I don't care how shame feels
Don't care how pain feels inside
Right now, don't care what I hear
Don't care what I fear inside

So now I'm going it alone
It feels like me against the world
I can't allow for an ounce of inability
I may be tetched, but for now I'm going all out

Right now, I don't care how shame feels
Don't care how pain feels inside
Right now, don't care what I hear
Don't care what I fear inside

I can't make room for comfort
I can't make room for myself

I'll keep my cool, defiantly
My strategy is not too sound
But I'm going all out

If there's a barrier up
I'm pushing through it
A door slammed in my face
I'm kicking through it

I will silence the doubts
Even if it fucks me up right now
I'm tetched, but I'm going all out
I'm pushing my limits

Right now, I don't care how shame feels
Don't care how pain feels inside
Right now, don't care what I hear
Don't care what I fear inside

Right now, I don't care how shame feels
Don't care how pain feels inside
Right now, don't care what I hear
Don't care what I fear inside

Right now, I don't care how shame feels
Don't care how pain feels inside
Right now, don't care what I hear
Don't care what I fear inside

It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter to me
