You came off, you scared to fall
And you came off, keep on the armour every time
It's one hell of a performance
You came off, just keep the same there at the try
I can't fix you if you're broken
If you can't crawl then you can't teach me how to fly
I'm uncertain, I'm hoping
If they ask me, I still tell 'em that you're mine

We don't wanna fight, we don't wanna fall in
It gets hard to dive and I
We don't wanna fight, we don't wanna call it
I still wanna try and I
Could this be us?
Are we running from the same ghost?
Could this be us?
And we fall before the flame goes down

You can't blind me with your conscience
I gets harder to see the fear in your eyes
We can both win if you coming
It's as easy as pretending that we're blind
Never said I can't, never said I won't
So hard when there's a doubt
And we're drowning, we wanna be free
Hardest when you're having doubts

We don't wanna fight, we don't wanna fall in
It gets hard to dive and I
We don't wanna fight, we don't wanna call it
I still wanna try and I
Could this be us?
Are we running from the same ghost?
Could this be us?
And we fall before the flame goes down
Could this be us?
Are we running from the same ghost?
Could this be us?
And we fall before the flame goes down
Could this be us?
Are we running from the same ghost?
Could this be us?
And we fall before the flame goes down
Could this be us?
Are we running from the same ghost?
Could this be us?
And we fall before the flame goes down
