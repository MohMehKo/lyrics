I, I feel electric, feel it coming on
It's what we do
I, I've been waiting just to sing my song
Just for you
Keep it rising with the sun
Keep it rising
Make me feel like number one
Come inside it

You got me feeling like I'm in a cloud
We were meant to stand out from the crowd
And you know we're never coming down
Down, down, down

Elevate, yeah
'Vate, yeah
Elevate, yeah
'Vate, yeah

I, I've been holding onto us all night
Me and you
Move, move your body like you're supposed to
Supposed to
No use in fighting, we have fun
Be united
If we're not bringing no love
What we bringing?

You got me feeling like I'm in a cloud
We were meant to stand out from the crowd
And you know we're never coming down
Down, down, down

Elevate, yeah
'Vate, yeah
Elevate, yeah
'Vate, yeah

Keep it rising
Keep it rising

Elevate, yeah
'Vate, yeah
Elevate, yeah
'Vate, yeah

Keep it rising
Keep it rising
