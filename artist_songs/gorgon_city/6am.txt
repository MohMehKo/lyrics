6AM yeah, yeah

So drunk in the morning at 1AM
That I'm calling your phone at 3AM
On my bed tonight at 6AM
6AM, 6AM, yeah, yeah

So drunk in the morning at 1AM
That I'm calling your phone at 3AM
On my bed tonight at 6AM
6AM, 6AM, yeah, yeah

A million hearts
Here tonight
Find your way
Back to mine
Till you return
Baby, thank you for the things you've changed
In my heart
You will always, always remain, girl

So drunk in the morning at 1AM
That I'm calling your phone at 3AM
On my bed tonight at 6AM
6AM, 6AM, yeah, yeah

So drunk in the morning at 1AM
That I'm calling your phone at 3AM
On my bed tonight at 6AM
6AM, 6AM, yeah, yeah

Had to get away, had to break out
Now I'm looking for you like a stakeout
Turning off the phone, thinking don't call
But oh, I just really wanna hear your voice now
If I had a dime and a dollar
For every motherfucker tryin' to holla'
I'd probably make a million in an hour
I want, I love, I love
I need you this morning
I need you this morning, yeah
I need you this morning
I need you this morning, oh yeah yeah yeah
