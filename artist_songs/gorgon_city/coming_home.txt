[Verse 1:]
I want these streets an answer
So I keep calling heaven
Meant to be back home with you
My shining star, you got me
Miss like limbo inside me
Will you wait, I won't be long

[Pre-Hook:]
I won't let, I won't keep anything
Hold me back from you
I'm telling the
Truth I'm promise you
I'll be there soon

[Hook:]
I'm coming home to you
I'm coming home to you
I'm coming home to you
I'm coming home to you

[Verse 2:]
These days grow long and weary
And it takes it's toll, I'm dreary
Smell your fragnance in the air
So close I'm weak and tired
Was lost but now I found it
Hear your voice get loud and keep

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook x2]

[Break:]
Coming home
And I'll be back before you wake
See I'll be back before you wake, darling
And I'll be back before you wake
When I'm near you I'm alive
When I feel your love I fly
What I need is you and I
I'll be there soon

[Hook x2]

[Outro:]
Coming home
