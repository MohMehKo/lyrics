You are the man cause you wasted me
Ain't got no time cause you're chasing dreams
And you're all alone cause you ain't gotta step
You'll never go cause you know I'll be there

Your heart is mine, you're haunting me
And now it seems you love her
Your heart is mine, you're haunting me
And now it seems you love her

No no no
I can't do this no longer, I'm torn
No no no
I can't do this no longer, no more
No no no
I can't do this no longer, I'm torn
No no no
I can't do this no longer, no longer

I look in your eyes as you look to me
Look to the sky is what I feel
Turning away cause you know my pain
And you chose cause you cannot complain

Your heart is mine, you're haunting me
And now it seems you love her
Your heart is mine, you're haunting me
And now it seems you love her

No no no
I can't do this no longer, I'm torn
No no no
I can't do this no longer, no more
No no no
I can't do this no longer, I'm torn
No no no
I can't do this no longer, no longer

No no no, no no no
No no no, no no no
No no no, I can't, no no no
No no no, I can't, no no no

No no no
I can't do this no longer, I'm torn
No no no
I can't do this no longer, no more
No no no
I can't do this no longer, I'm torn
No no no
I can't do this no longer, no longer

No no no, I can't, no no no
No no no, I can't, no no no
No no no, I can't, no no no
No no no, I can't, no no no
