Face down on my chest
Wake up and you are there
Your touch takes my tears
But I'm lying here wondering if you are sincere

I pray that what you give me is real
I hate that it's the way I feel
Nothing seems too clear for me to see

And I can't dream for love with you
If I can't recognize the truth
I watch you as you rest
I'm so confused

'Cause I don't wanna be used darling it's too hard on me
And I don't know what to do darling but choose honesty
And I don't wanna be used darling it's too hard on me
And I don't know what to do darling but choose honesty

Brush your hair off your cheeks
And your smile as you're fast asleep
My fears tell me to go
But as you're whispering in my ears that I soothe
So I don't

I pray that what you give me is real
I hate that it's the way I feel
Nothing seems too clear for me to see

But I don't wanna be used darling it's too hard on me
And I don't know what to do darling but choose honesty
And I don't wanna be used darling it's too hard on me
And I don't know what to do darling but choose honesty

Oh please darling don't use me
Please darling don't use me
Oh please darling don't use me

So I don't know how I can take it
And I don't know how I can make it
And I don't know how I can take it
And I don't know how I can make it

Please darling don't
Please darling don't
