Let me take to a trip 'round the world and back
Everything disappears, the way you're movin' baby
Do me a favor, stay in this moment
Once I was shattered, once I was broken
It's coming together, my adventure
Oh, don't be scared, right here
Do me a favor, stay in this moment
Once I was shattered, once you were broken
We're coming together, oh don't be scared
I know, I'm right here

Kissing your scars softly,
Watching you giving me slowly
Fuck the pain away
Fuck the pain away!
Uuh, let me do that for you
Please let me do that for you
Fuck the pain away
Fuck the pain away!

Sure you wanna get, get to you
Let your body do talking, I'll be listening
I'll be listening!
Do me a favor, stay in this moment
Once I was shattered, once I was broken
It's coming together, my adventure
Oh, don't be scared, right here
Do me a favor, stay in this moment
Once I was shattered, once you were broken
We're coming together, oh don't be scared
I know, I'm right here

Kissing your scars softly,
Watching you giving me slowly
Fuck the pain away
Fuck the pain away!
Uuh, let me do that for you
Please let me do that for you
Fuck the pain away
Fuck the pain away!

I know it, ooh oh
I know it, uh baby
I know it, uh baby
I know it, uh baby
It wasn't me...

Kissing your scars softly,
Watching you giving me slowly
Fuck the pain away
Fuck the pain away!
Uuh, let me do that for you
Please let me do that for you
Fuck the pain away
Fuck the pain away!
