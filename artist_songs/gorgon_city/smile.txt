The trees are stripped back
And the skies are dark winds
Oh when the leaves hit the ground
They take flight
Oh little one, don't cry for the winter
I know you're cold for a little while
See the mist in the distance linger
And you smile

But you smile like everything's alright
Alright when you smile
Oh but you smile like everything's alright
Alright when you smile

Look at me in the cool breeze
Put my head high in the bright light
You know I pick up pace when I take lead
Another look in your eyes
Just us when the dust goes in
So keep close when the cold bites
Only wanna keep on holding
You smile

But you smile like everything's alright
Alright when you smile
Oh but you smile like everything's alright
Alright when you smile

(Smile)
I carry you away to a good place
I carry you
There's nothing in my way
Nothing in my way
But I carry you, oh, I carry you

But you smile like everything's alright
Alright when you smile
Oh but you smile like everything's alright
Alright when you smile

When you smile
But you smile like everything's alright
Alright when you smile
