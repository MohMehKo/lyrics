I'm not sure of what I'm thinking
maybe I think too much
swimming round inside my pitchball life
not reading all the books
I'll tell you what they say
one of them or all of them today

and no, she doesn't know the dates
she'd never know the weight
and I'd really like to see you one last time

all this time was wasted on you
so burn the lights and breaking bridges is what we're seeing
I didn't think this would
or could ever happen to me at all

now that I am the one
I'd really rather not be anything
anything at all
and you will call about the things
they don't matter at all, at all, at all
you will follow around the things
they don't matter at all, at all, at all

[x4]
and no, she doesn't know the dates
she'd never know the weight
and I'd really like to see you one last time
