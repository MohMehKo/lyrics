This whole thing started back 
two years ago
It seems like everything was
going great
And then one day I though
I saw a note
It said: "Hey, it was nice meeting you,
just give me a call"
And everything after that 
seemed so rough
It seemed like things were
changing oh so quickly
And right there before my eyes
everything changed tonight

Girl, you wanna run around
just gonna let me down
just like you do
I, don't wanna wait around
I need to stand my ground
and get out of town

And it was then that I knew
we were through
And she said something like:
"Boy your crazy, you'll never
ever get a girl like me"
That's fine, it's time
alright, I know - 
I'm doing just fine

Girl, you wanna run around
just gonna let me down
just like you do
I, don't wanna wait around
I need to stand my ground
and get out of town

Girl, you wanna run around
just gonna let me down
just like you do
I, don't wanna wait around
I need to stand my ground
and get out of town

It was over from the start
Now everything is in the dark
It was over from the start
and nothing's changing, changing, changing 
It was over from the start
Now everything is the dark
And nothing's changing, changing, changing

Girl, you wanna run around
just gonna let me down
just like you do
I, don't wanna wait around
I need to stand my ground
and get out of town

Girl, you wanna run around
just gonna let me down
just like you do
I, don't wanna wait around
I need to stand my ground
and get out of town
