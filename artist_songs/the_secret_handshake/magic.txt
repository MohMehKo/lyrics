Girl I wish you weren't with him wish we could be more then just friends maybe we go out on a limb just let me love you maybe we go out late one night see if we could get it just right maybe you would give me a kiss and my song will start out like this ohhh you

You lookin oh so sweet you'll sweep me off my feet this feels like magic (like magic) I could just touch 
the sky and you just come out right this feels like magic (like magic) I know I'm not always cool I can act like a fool but maybe if you can give me one chance just let me love you I know I'm talking to much and acting crazy and such just got to be in your life girl just let me love you 

You lookin oh so sweet you'll sweep me off my feet this feels like magic (like magic) I could just touch the sky and you just come out right this feels like magic (like magic)

You lookin oh so sweet you'll sweep me off my feet this feels like magic (like magic) I could just touch the sky and you just come out right this feels like magic (like magic)
