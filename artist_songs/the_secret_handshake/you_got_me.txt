This is a song
Songs about a lot of things, but
Really it's about
It's about love
Falling out of love

Someone like you
And someone like me
Were never meant, never meant to be
And that's why you
Gotta set me free
'Cause you got me wanting to be your little refugee 

And I said you got me (Got me) 
Upside-down 
I said you got me (Got me)
Spinning around
I said you got me feeling so let down it's true (It's true)
Because you never, ever see my point of view
And you even wouldn't be my dream come true

You never say
Nice things to me
You're always giving me the third degree
And I refuse, to let you walk
All over me, one more time
I think we need to talk

And I said you got me (Got me) 
Upside-down 
I said you got me (Got me)
Spinning around
I said you got me feeling so let down it's true (It's true)
Because you never, ever see my point of view
And you even wouldn't be my dream come true

And I guess this is the end
I know we used to friends
But things are gonna be alright
Cause we've been fighting like kids
It's something that I forbid 
But things are gonna be fine

And I said you got me (Got me) 
Upside-down 
I said you got me (Got me)
Spinning around
I said you got me feeling so let down it's true (It's true)
Because you never, ever see my point of view
And you even wouldn't be my dream come true
