When you left
I couldn't take it
Just one more time
It drove hole right through my heart
And now that your gone
I can't fake it
One more time
You left a hole right through my heart

[Chorus:]
So I, I watch you like a midnight movie
You, You act as if you never knew me
All this time
Yeah, yeah
And I, I watch you like a midnight movie

I'm staring at the screen
I'm wishing that could be you and me
Staring out my car window
I'm watching you watching you watching watching you

I'm staring at the movie
Wishing that could be you and me
Staring out my car window
I'm watching you watching you watching you watching you

[Chorus:]
So I, I watch you like a midnight movie
You, You act as if you never knew me
All this time
Yeah, yeah
and I, I watch you like a midnight movie

Baby I miss you
Cause Baby I miss you
Baby I miss you
Cause Baby I miss you
Baby I miss your love

[Chorus:]
I, I watch you like a midnight movie
You, You act as if you never knew me
All this time
Yeah, yeah
and I, I watch you like a midnight movie

I, I watch you like a midnight movie (I miss you)
You, You act as if you never knew me (Baby I miss you)
All this time (Baby I miss you)
Yeah, yeah (Baby I miss you )
and I, I watch you like a midnight movie

I, I watch you like a midnight movie (Baby I miss you)
You, You act as if you never knew me (Baby I miss you)
All this time (Baby I miss you)
Yeah, yeah
and I, I watch you like a midnight movie (Baby I miss your love)
