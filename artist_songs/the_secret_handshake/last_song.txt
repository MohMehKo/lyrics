All of my friends said that I should just wait a little
All of my friends said that you weren't the one
And to that I replied, 
Just worry bout your own life 
Because I knew that you were my love

I met you on a Sunday
And we got married on that Monday
And now life's looking so good
It's looking so good
And I wanted you to like me
But now you just surprise me
And now life's looking so good
It's looking so good
Oh

I'm so glad that I found you [x3]
In the silliest of ways
And I wanted you to like me
And now you just surprise me
I'm so glad that I found you
So glad that I found you
Oh
