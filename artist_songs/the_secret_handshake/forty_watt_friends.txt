It’s kind of sad 
to think about times that I left you
It’s kind of sad
To think about times you seen me off

As a kid I always knew that something wasn’t right

Counting the times that we’ve started over [X2]

I’ve let you go, so many times
I don’t deserve you
I’ve let your thoughs 
And it amazes me that you still want me here

Counting the times that we’ve started over [X2]

I’ve let you down so many times
You’ve seen me off but that’s alright

You are all I have
I’ve said its true
You wanna tell me I don’t need you
I don't need you

Counting the times that we’ve started over [X2]

I’ve said it’s right
I’ve said it’s true
I do need you
And I know what it’s true to me
I want you back
And I've said everything I’ve ever wanted here
