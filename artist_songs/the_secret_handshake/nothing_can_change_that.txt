'Cause all I've ever really wanted was to get out of this town and get away from our parents, baby cause they always kept me down. 
And all I've ever really wanted was just to move away with you and fall in love by the beach, the sun is shining.
I think that you'd like it too. 
I love you, I love you, I love you.
Nothing can change that fact.
I love you, I love you, I love you and every time I look in your eyes.
Nothing can change that. 
'Cause all I've ever really wanted is just to sing this song for you.
So you could know how I've been feeling lately and I think that you'd feel it too.
Let's get away from your parents and I'll get away from my own, 'cause where we're going nothing can stop us.
I'll never leave you alone. 
I love you, I love you, I love you.
Nothing can change that fact.
I love you, I love you, I love you and every time I look in your eyes.
Nothing can change that. 
I never wanted this to end.
Never want this to slow and every time I think that you should know how I really feel, how I really feel, how I feel. 
I love you, I love you, I love you.
Nothing can change that fact.
I love you, I love you, I love you and every time I look in your eyes.
