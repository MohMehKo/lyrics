Well I had nothing to prove, 
And I had nothing to lose, 
Just wanted to get beside you.
Well I had nowhere to be, 
And I had nothing to see, 
Just wanted to feel alive, yeah.

Well baby (baby), 
Yeah baby (baby)
Ever since the moment that I met you, 
I've been livin' (livin'), 
Just livin' (livin'), 
And I hope that things could stay the same between me and you.

'Cause every single time that I'm with you, 
I'm feeling so alive, 
Like I've got nothing to lose.
Things are just getting better now that you've come around.
I don't feel any pressure, 
I got my feet off the ground.
I'm feelin' something inside me, 
Is it happening to you?
Ooo I feel love takin' over.

Well baby (baby), 
Yeah baby (baby)
Ever since the moment that I met you, 
I've been livin' (livin'), 
Just livin' (livin'), 
And I hope that things could stay the same between me and you.

'Cause every single time that I'm with you, 
I'm feeling so alive, 
Like I've got nothing to lose.

'Cause every single time, yeah
Every single time, oh yeah.
I'm feeling so alive, like I've got nothing to lose.

'Cause I don't know what's happening to me; 
I'm just feeling so new, 
And I'm feeling so free.

'Cause every single time that I'm with you, 
I'm feeling so alive, 
Like I've got nothing to lose.

'Cause every single time that I'm with you...
