It's a little overwhelming
to think about how life isn't as easy as we hoped
while the bills keep pouring in
it's hard to fill you in
between the work place and dispair
we all know it isn't fair

It's not time to call it quits
'cause you know you got nothing to lose
'cause they're the ones who wont make it
and it's not cool
but it'll be over soon

And you wake up at six
with your eyes partially open
and stumble off to work
on the problems of your life
and when you stumble home
from the job that you despise
there's a place on the seat
where you once felt first love

Keep them at heart
cause they're the people who love you
and right from the start we all knew something was wrong

Lets all try to sing along
learn the words to this song
that we'll look back on

Lets all try to sing along
learn the words to this song
that we'll look back on
