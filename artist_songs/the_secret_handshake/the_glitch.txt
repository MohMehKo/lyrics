Do you miss me?
to the extent of separation
or is it just more of
the feeling in disguise
there's an army at your door
they're shouting out your name
wishing for you to come back
to the way things used to be

when everything's amiss
just remember
to call
'cause I'll be singing you to sleep
when everything's amiss
just remember
to call
'cause I'll be singing you to sleep

hope you get my postcards
hope it displays
an effort
'cause I love
may my words keep you warm
on a cold winter's night
it seems so overbearing

when everything's amiss
just remember
to call
'cause I'll be singing you to sleep
when everything's amiss
just remember
to call
'cause I'll be singing you to sleep

I wait for the start
she tells me not to speak
I waited for
she tells me not to speak
I wanted more
she tells me not to speak
