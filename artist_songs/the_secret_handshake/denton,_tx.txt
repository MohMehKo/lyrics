The party's getting old
And I'm afraid 
That this script seems 
Too played-out for me to come back
How careless can you get?
How reckless will you get?
Woah-oh-oh

'Cause I'm finding it hard
To forgive and forget
I wanna return, I wanna say "yes"

I think it's funny how the story changes
More and more and more
It keeps elaborating
And as it progresses, it just gets even worse
On and on, and on, and on

'Cause I'm finding it hard
To forgive and forget
I wanna return, I wanna say "yes"
'Cause I'm finding it hard
To forgive and forget
I wanna return, I wanna say "yes"

You're drunk and the room's a spinning blur
It seems like right here is where problems occur
And as the music stops, you blackout, you blackout

The party's getting old
And I'm afraid 
That this script seems 
Too played-out for me to come back
How careless can you get?
How reckless will you get?
Woah-oh-oh

'Cause I'm finding it hard
To forgive and forget
I wanna return, I wanna say "yes"
'Cause I'm finding it hard
To forgive and forget
I wanna return, I wanna say "yes"

'Cause I'm finding it hard
To forgive and forget
I wanna return, I wanna say "yes"
'Cause I'm finding it hard
To forgive and forget
I wanna return, I just wanna say "yes"
