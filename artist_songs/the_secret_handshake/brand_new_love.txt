Just pick up the phone
And tell me your name
I just need to know if you have a man today
Just pick up the phone girl
Don't turn me away
I got your number from a friend
Who said you were feeling me

I could be your man 
And be there for you
I would be around 
Baby be a dream come true
Just give me a chance girl
I'm really feeling you
I wanna tell you everything
This love is so brand new

Girl you know that I am your man
I've been feelin you, feelin you oh
I need you to feel me, thats the plan

So tell me you in girl
Cause I'm feeling you
I know I want you to be everything for me
And I'll take you out girl 
Baby have a good time
Make you forget everything
Only love is on your mind

I could be your man
And be there for you
I would be around 
Baby be a dream come true 
Just give me a chance girl
I'm really feelin you
I wanna tell you everything
This love is so brand new

Girl you know that I am your man
