I don't wanna be a lover
If your don't wanna be my friend
And I don't wanna be a lover
If you can't love me till' the end
It's like you've done this before
You love to do this to me
Push my head down to the floor
My knees are feeling so weak
I'm feeling outta control
This doesn't even seem real
To me whoaa

So how you gonna walk away from me when I'm talking to you?
And how you gonna walk away from me when I tell you the truth?
And how you gonna walk away from me when I'm talking to you?

I don't wanna be a lover
If you don't wanna be my friend
And I don't wanna be another
Relationship you brought to an end
It's like a try to ignore the things you sayin to me
Push my head down to the floor

My knees are feelin so weak
I'm feelin outta control
This doesn't even seem real
To me whoa

So how you gonna walk away from me when I'm talking to you?
And how you gonna walk away from me when I tell you the truth?
And how you gonna walk away from me when I'm talking to you?
[x2]

Hey girl your so wonderful, but you might be
Too crazy for me. So say girl
Your so wonderful, but you've got me, head over heals
[x2]

So how you gonna walk away from me when I'm talking to you?
And how you gonna walk away from me when I tell you the truth?
And how you gonna walk away when I'm talking to you?
