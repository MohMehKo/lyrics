What's it li-ike to give up on your dreams?
I hope I never have to find out
I'm feeling dow-ow-own (ooh, ooh)
I'm tearing at the seems
And here I am just singing out (singing)

But I fear I'm getting closer-er-er (getting closer)
I'm worried all the time

I'm calling you out
Like we did when we were kids
And you still had dreams of making it big
How can it be that you gave up?
It's all a show
You keep falling down just like a domino
(You keep falling down just like a domino)

You never tri-i-ied (ooh, ooh)
You never made it real
You never even bothered to shou-out (shout)
I'm making sou-ou-ounds (ooh, ooh)
I'm working on my dreams,
But here I am just singing out (singing)

But I fear I'm getting closer-er-er (getting closer)
I'm worried all the time

I'm calling you out
Like we did when we were kids
And you still had dreams of making it big
How can it be that you gave up?
It's all a show
You keep falling down just like a domino
(You keep falling down just like a domino)
(You keep falling down just like a domino)

No one knows (no one knows)
What's in store, (what's in store)
But you got to (got to)
Keep on (keep on)
Moving on
It takes time to grow (time to grow)
You never know (never know)
And you got to (got to)
Try to (try to)
Prove me wrong

I'm calling you out
Like we did when we were kids
And you still had dreams of making it big
How can it be that you gave up?
It's all a show
You keep falling down just like a domino
You keep falling down just like a domino
You keep falling down just like a domino
