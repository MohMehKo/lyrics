(Huh)
In one quick motion baby I saw that you turned away
Feelin like a girl whose not enough
Enough for today
And in that motion I thought
I thought that I heard you say
Never again love

What's wrong?
Your acting kinda strange
Ain't treating me the same
What's wrong?
Your acting kinda strange
Ain't treating me the same

She said
I don't wanna have a bad night
I don't wanna have a bad day
I just want to be loved
Have my problems fade
I don't wanna have a bad night
I don't wanna have a bad day
I just wanna have a good time

I never thought that I would
That I'd be begging you
That I'd be wanting you to
To stay just one more day
I never thought that I would
That i would have to do this
We've been together so long, love
And now it's the last day
And I know there's something you wanna say to me
About the way you've been feeling

What's wrong?
Your acting kinda strange
Ain't treating me the same
What's wrong?
Your acting kinda strange
Ain't treating me the same

She said
I don't wanna have a bad night
I don't wanna have a bad day
I just want to be loved
Have my problems fade
I don't wanna have a bad night
I don't wanna have a bad day
I just wanna have a good time

I know your gonna leave me
(leave me, leave me)
I know you've been deceiving
(deceiving, deceiving)
I know your gonna leave me
(leave me, leave me)
Tonight

What's wrong?
Your acting the same
Ain't treating me the same
What's wrong?
Your acting kinda strange
Ain't treating me the same

She said
I don't wanna have a bad night
I don't wanna have a bad day
I just want to be loved
Have my problems fade
I don't wanna have a bad night
I don't wanna have a bad day
I just wanna have a good time

What's wrong?
Your acting kinda strange
Ain't treating me the same
What's wrong?
Your acting kinda strange
Ain't treating me the same

She said
I don't wanna have a bad night
I don't wanna have a bad day
I just want to be loved
Have my problems fade
I don't wanna have a bad night
I don't wanna have a bad day
I just wanna have a good time
