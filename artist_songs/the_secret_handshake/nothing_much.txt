Your goodbyes seem a little uneasy
As of lately this month
And I'm beginning to wonder
If it's time for me
To write this song
To right this wrong
And that's alright

You know the one where I question our love
Question our fight
Then question myself

You know the one where I question our love
Question our fight
Question..

I just wanna be sure
I mean, maybe it's over
And I'm not real sure
I think too much

Cause I'm aware if I don't play my cards right
That this game could be ending
And that's alright
Cause I'm aware if I don't play my cards right
That this game could be ending
I'm leaving you tonight

P.s. just let me know what you're thinking about right now
P.s. just let me know what you're thinking right now

You know the one where I question, question our love
And then question, question our fight
And then question why I'm here

You know the one where I question, question our love
And I question, question our fight
And wonder..

Cause I'm aware if I don't play my cards right
That this game could be ending
And that's alright
Cause I'm aware if I don't play my cards right
That this game could be ending
I'm leaving you tonight

Cause I'm aware if I don't play my cards right
That this game could be ending
And that's alright
Cause I'm aware if I don't play my cards right
That this game could be ending
I'm leaving you tonight
