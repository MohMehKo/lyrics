Don't need no ordinary woman
don't need another waste of time
the traps been set
need some respect from you

I bet you never saw this coming (yeah)
you never thought it's just that I might love you
I'll make you sweat
make you forget your name

girl you're the one for me

I don't know what
don't know what is that I want from you
but I know that
I know that what you've got is feelin' true

So I'm right here holding on
feeling so far gone
for you

girl you're the one for me

An extraordinary someone (yeah)
maybe I'm crazy but I don't think it's too much
to tell her she's the only real one

maybe the one for me

I've tried and tried but didn't get far (yeah)
I never ever thought that I might find you, girl
don't be upset
there's no regrets when you're this far in love

I don't know what
don't know what is that I want from you
but I know that
I know that what you've got is feelin' true

I'm right here holding on
feeling so far gone
for you

girl you're the one for me

I've seen you in my dreams
that's why this feels so real
I need you on my team
it could be so surreal

You wanted something good
I wanted something new

cuz you got
what I want
cuz you got
what I need

cuz you got
what I want
cuz you got
what I need

come on baby now

I don't know what
don't know what is that I want from you
but I know that
I know that what you've got is feelin' true

I don't know what
don't know what is that I want from you

girl you're the one for me
