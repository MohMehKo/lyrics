Don't read what I say
Don't see me for now
For now at all
Don't read what I say
Don't see me for now 
For now at all
Don't listen to me
Don't see me for now
For now at all
At all

I started thinking how could this happen
How could this happen to me at all
Falling right into you
Into you

Don't read what I say
Don't see me for now 
For now at all
Don't listen to me
It doesn't come for free at all
I'd like you to be 
Something that's real
Something that's me
To be to be to be

I started thinking how could this happen
How could this happen to me at all
Falling right into you
Into you
I started thinking how could this happen
How could this happen to me at all
Falling right into you
Into you

Don't fall back on me
On your way down
Don't fall back on me 
On your wasted world

I started thinking how could this happen
How could this happen to me at all
Falling right into you
Into you
I started thinking how could this happen
How could this happen to me at all
Falling right into you
Into you
