I've been trying to write a song about you
I've been trying here but no such luck
And I've been trying to write a song that describes just how much
I need you tonight
And I've working at this song for ages
I wanted to make sure it came out right
I hope that it shows how things really are here 
And how I am feeling alright

I wanna write 
The soundtrack to your life and live it with you (with you)
I wanna write 
The soundtrack to your life and live it with you (with you, with you)

So first I started with this simple beat and
I even added a piano tune
But then I had to think of words that describe 
The things I really wanna sing to you
(OH)
So now I'm working on this melody and
I think I can add a harmony
I just want for this song to come together
Then maybe you'd see what you mean to me

I wanna write 
The soundtrack to your life and live it with you (with you)
I wanna write 
The soundtrack to your life and live it with you (with you, with you)
I wanna write 
The soundtrack to your life and live it with you (with you)
I wanna write 
The soundtrack to your life and live it with you (with you, with you)

So baby, just remember
As this song hits your ears
I'm trying to turn the way I feel for you
Into something that you can hear
But how can words and music
Explain what love is?
Nothing I can sing do it justice
And I don't know where to start
I just want you to hear the song in my heart
(OH)

I wanna write 
The soundtrack to your life and live it with you (with you)
I wanna write 
The soundtrack to your life and live it with you (with you, with you)
I wanna write 
The soundtrack to your life and live it with you (with you)
I wanna write 
The soundtrack to your life and live it with you (with you, with you, you you you)
