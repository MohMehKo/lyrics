Dear Friend I'm writing you this letter
To remind you of the promise you made
Dear friend I'm writing you this letter
To remind you of that summer
last summer

We held each other's hands
And said we'd fight the distance
The way the summer days and nights would last forever
We held no resistance

I am wishing that you would be here
Wishing that we'd fall we'd fall in love again
I'm wishing that we'd fall fall in love again

So I sit 
And wait for you
To write me back
It's all I've got
So I sit
And wait for you
To write me back
Cuz I know you're...
Because I know you're...

I'm wishing that we'd fall
We'd fall in love again
I'm wishing that we'd fall we'd fall in love again

Everything just needs to work breakin' up so slowly
I need to know
Everything needs to work and I'm praying loud 
Slowly [?] internal
I'm wishing that we'd fall
we'd fall in love again

I'm wishing that we would fall, we would fall in love again.
