You used to be so sweet to me
Now you've left me feeling so incomplete
I don't know what you've done to me
I've been lonely (I've been lonely)

So just last year you started acting weird
And I knew the things you said were insincere
But I played the part of the fool
I played that role for you

And Mama said to just give it time (but)

[Chorus:]
I (I) don't (don't) love (love) you (you), anymore (anymore) [X2]
And I've fallen out of love
Ya, I've fallen out of love

You used to be easy to read
Now it's hard for me to know what you mean
I don't know what you want from me
Say you're lonely
But you don't own me

But then you were so moody for about a year
And I thought it was just cuz' you were insecure
So I gave you a little ro-oo-oom
Thought it'd be good for yo-oo-oou

And Daddy said you're gonna be fi-i-i-ine

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Ooo, believe it or not
This was just part of the plot
I-I tried to just keep us going
But in the end I stopped

I guess we're done playing games
I'll try to forget your name
Cuz' in the end it's just the way it goes...

I (I) don't (don't) love (love) you (you), anymore (anymore)
I don't love you anymore
You're gonna be fi-i-ine

[Chorus]
