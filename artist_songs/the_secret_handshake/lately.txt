Can you turn the music up in the headphones?

Theres to many hours to count down to midnight
But you never wanted to let it go
when your talking for hours
You said you wanted, you want to know
Oh

When you wait for it to say
I'm not talking
You wait for it to say
I'm not walking
I don't know where it all went wrong

When you wait for me to say
I'm not talking
I wait for you to say
I'm not walking
I don't know where it all went wrong

But doesn't it seem alittle strange the way we've been treated lately
Doesn't it seem alittle strange to you, to you

But doesn't it seem alittle strange the way we've been treated lately
Doesn't it seem alittle strange to you, to you

Doesn't it seem alittle strange the way we've been treated lately
Doesn't it seem alittle strange to you, to you

But that all right
It's the way that we walking away
Because we waiting for the night to come to an end
It's just the way that we dancing so close
The way we walking nice and 
The way we waiting for the night to come to an end

Doesn't it seem alittle strange the way we've been treated lately
Doesn't it seem alittle strange to you, to you

Doesn't it seem alittle strange the way we've been treated lately
Doesn't it seem alittle strange to you, to you

Doesn't it seem alittle strange the way we've been treated lately
Doesn't it seem alittle strange to you, to you

Doesn't it seem alittle strange the way we've been treated lately
Doesn't it seem alittle strange to you, to you

Doesn't it seem alittle strange the way we've been treated lately
Doesn't it seem alittle strange to you, to you

But that all right
It's the way that we walking away
Because we waiting for the night to come to an end
It's just the way that we dancing so close
The way we walking nice and..
The way we waiting for the night to come to an end
