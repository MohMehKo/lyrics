The phone called ended in such a way
That I wasn't sure just what to say
Who to call, how to feel,
And won't someone tell me is this even real, oh
I'm such a mess
I'm such a reck, oh
I'm such a mess

Is there some extra space,
On your floor
Next to your bed
And if you let me stay so
I'll be there
Cause in the night time when your sleeping
I'll be there to say
That I loved you and I left you anyway

Is there some extra space,
On your floor
Next to your bed
And if you let me stay so
I'll be there
Cause in the night time when your sleeping
I'll be there to say
That I loved you, I left you anyway

I was lost as a latchkey child
And I saw more than I could handle
Left alone
In the lonely isle
Left to stare into you

The phone called ended with drop me a line
I though about it long, and hard.
Don't play me for the fool
Even though I'm just the fool for you
I'll turn into a mess
And and and when the snow comes down
And covers up the ground
To see you for what you really are

Play me for the fool
Even though I'm just the fool for you
I'll turn into a mess

And when the snow comes down
And covers up the ground
To see you for what you really are

The phone called ended in such a way
That I wasn't sure just what to say
Who to call, how to feel,
Won't someone tell me is this even real, oh
I'm such a mess
I'm such a reck, oh
I'm such a mess.
