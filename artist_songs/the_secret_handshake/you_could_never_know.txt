I'll tell you that I'm sorry.
I'll tell you it's all okay.
I'll tell you I'm sorry.
I'll tell you it's sad.

But you know, you know the truth.
I, I said I'd tell you the truth.
And you know, you know the truth
You know, you know me for
I'll tell you for grant
I'll take you for everything you might never be.
And you, you said it's alright.
And you, you said you'd take me back
And I see no harm in this
And I see the road less?
Tag their wives along?
Tell secrets to tongue?
No, no one will know
No one will know
No one will know
What we will plan
To move away
To see the pattern?

Said there's no one I would rather be with.
I said right.
I've known it all along
I told you there's no one I would rather be with
I told you you're right all along.

And no one will know of our secret thus far
And no, no one can know, no one can know
No one can know where

See you there
I'll see you there alone.
I'll see you there alone.
I'll see you there alone.
