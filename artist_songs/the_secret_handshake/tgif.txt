The year was 1995
And I was too young to drive.
I felt so stuck on the inside
Of my life.
Whoa Whoa
Just livin' out my life through my TV
With all my favorite shows.
Wanted my life to work out so easy
Don't care if anybody knows.
Yeah
But now I'm old enough to drive.
No one can keep me inside.
Now I've got the day on my mind.
It's my life.
Whoa Whoa
Step By Step, these are Family Matters
And why Boy Meets World, I'll never ever know
Who's the Boss here?
Its a Fresh Prince.
We got a Full House, let's get the show on the road.
Just livin' out my life through my TV
With all my favorite shows.
Wanted my life to work out so easy
Don't care if anybody knows.
Yeah
But now I'm old enough to drive.
No one can keep me inside.
Now I got the day on my mind.
It's my life.
Whoa Whoa
