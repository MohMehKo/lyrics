I can't stand,
That we're all connected.
And I miss the days,
When I only knew my friends.
The whole world,
Thinks they know all about me.
But they'll miss the day,
When they only knew without me.

I can't stand
Without seein' your
Pretty faces.

And I miss the days.
When I was excited,
About seein the new things.
It seems so long ago.
Now we're all,
Virtually connected.
And I miss the days,
When I only knew my friends.

I can't stand
Without seein your
Pretty faces.
Now we're all
Connected.
Seems so far beyond.

Seems so far.
[repeat x3]

Now we're all
Connected.
Seems so far beyond.

And it's time.
Yeah it's time,
That we knew.
We're all, it's all
That I have for you.
And it's time.
Yeah it's time,
That we knew.
We're all, and it's all
That I have for you.

I can't stand
Without seein' your
Pretty faces.
