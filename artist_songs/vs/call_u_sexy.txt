[Echo Chinyere]
I'm in the back room 
Listening to the girls 
Who saw u in the club & they want u baby, 
Can't blame them 
Kinda feel the same 
It's about to be a game & I got to win it, 
Wanna know u, before they do, 
& I got a little place we can go to, 
& u can show me some of your tattoos 

[Ryan]
Hey Mammi, Take it easy, 
Just looking at you can't please me, 
What can I say, Feel the same way, 
Let's go somewhere we can play 

[Chorus:]

[Chinyere]
Why do they call you sexy, I'll tell you why they call you, 
Cuz your pants be sagging & your smile be banging, 
A cool little gangsta style - baby 

[Marvin & Ryan]
Why do they call you sexy, I'll tell you why they call you, 
Cuz your hips be showing & your lips be singing, 
There's so many reasons to call you sexy 

[Chorus:]

[Jaime]
Yo it's the baggy jeans, teeth clean, (colgate lean) 
That got me keen, 
I gotta get to know you boy cuz every night you're in my dreams, 
Chest flex show off your pecs 
That's the way you impress, 
The things you do the sexy ways 
That grab the ladies interest 

[Marvin]
By the DJ Booth 
Talking to my boys 
Who saw you on the floor 
& they want you baby, 
But the way you looking over here, 
Just seems like you made your choice already, 
Now it's on you, 
Can I call you, 
Or do you have a little place we can go to, 
& you can show me some of those dirty moves - baby 

[Chinyere]
Hey Pappi, Take it easy, 
Cuz I know you know where you tease me, 
What can I say, Feel the same way 
Let's go somewhere we can play 

[Chorus]

[Blimi]
Tight clothes, lips connect with them eyes closed, 
& when I'm chillin & (billin) that's how the game goes, 
Bring on the (fur) to fix that colourful rainbow, 
& you ain't even interested in other players oh 

[Marvin]
What's the deal about you, 
That makes it feel so right, 
That's the reason why they call you 

[Chorus x2]
