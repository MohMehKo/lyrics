Mr. Merry cries in his coffin for days he says he can remember
And through the town some pallbearers sing old songs of a beautiful
and purple mountian
From every walk of life we've come to see the last great American 

So may I now present you the speaker
....friends he was a man of men, yeah a man of gold
....he had a (how to you say) ethical like sense
That's when the President started to giggle 

Then the children gave the blessing
though the service weren't half done
each of them sued the other one...for the last great American 

Wait...Time for my coffin
Wait...Time for my break
Wait...Time for my coffin 

Merry reaches up and we bow our heads
Pulls the lid on down and his stone is read 

Here lies our Merry
The man with the heart so spent
That in this day in age
is sick of living 

Still judges argue letters
And fabric comes undone
For every daughter...every son..of the last great American
