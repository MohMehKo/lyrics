Put away your tears and your sleepy eyes.
Put away your bullshit.
Big Boys they don't cry to their mammas.
She'll be back soon. 

Put away your rain coat and make your bed.
Take another bullet right to your head now.
We're going on a picnic
and we'll get there soon. 

And she says maybe it's over.
And he says, there's plenty more fish in the sea
But I say, don't go away...from me. 

So put away your dinner and have a snack.
Tie your little brother up in a sack.
We're moving to the country
And we'll get there soon. 

Pack up all the things that you don't deserve.
Take another swing, well here comes a curve ball.
I betcha can't hit it
Cause you'll swing too soon. 

And she says maybe it's over.
And he says, there's plenty more fish in the sea.
But I say, Don't go away...
Don't go away...
Please don't go away...from me 

But can you take it to heart...
I'll never leave... 

So take those damn pictures off of that shelf.
Put away your mommy. You don't need her.
I found you a new one.
And she'll be here soon. 

And she says, My God it's over.
And he says, I found another fish in the sea 

But I say, why me...why me
why...is it me?
