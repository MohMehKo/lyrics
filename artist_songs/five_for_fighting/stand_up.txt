If you write a tragedy
where you can't be saved
If your dreams put you asleep
Cause your bed is made

Stand Up Stand Up
Stand Up Stand Up
Cause you're falling down

If you have to paint your face
and you're not a clown
If you're naked lost in space
And all you wears a frown

Stand Up Stand Up
Stand Up Stand Up
Cause you're falling down
Stand Up Stand Up
Stand Up Stand Up
Before you hit the ground

There is no perfect man
We are just who I am
If you don't understand
Well don't give up

Cause one and one is two
Enough to get us through
If I can count on you
To just stand up

Can anybody out there hear me, hear me
Can anybody out there hear me, hear me

Stand Up Stand Up
Cause you're falling down
Stand Up Stand Up
Before you hit the ground

Stand Up Stand Up
Cause you're falling down
Stand Up Stand Up
Before you hit the ground

If you have to paint your face
And you're not a clown
If you're naked lost in space
And the world lets you down

If you write a tragedy
where you can't be saved
