Blood on the ground,
Sun turning red.
Head over heels,
Over our heads.

Trouble will rise,
And tears will be shed.
Wherever we go,
Whatever comes next.

We'll always-
We'll always be-
One for all,
And all for one.

Bridges we've crossed,
Battles we've had.
Love we have lost,
Dreams we have shared.

We'll always-
We'll always be-
One for all,
And all for one.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
All for one.

My brother, myself,
My saviour, my friend.
The fire we are,
The fire will end.
If I should fall-
Or you don't make it back-
Together we'll rise,
Together we'll stand.

We'll always-
We'll always be-
One for all,
And all for one.
We'll always-
We'll always be-
One for all,
And all for one.
One for all,
And all for one.
All for one.
