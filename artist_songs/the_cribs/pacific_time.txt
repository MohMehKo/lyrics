Forget this, this revery
It takes a foul to chop me
While most went unspoken
Pacific time's frozen

Maybe your silence will tell me what I need
Till I find what you're hiding from me
Maybe, the angels have got you too
I'm you can't say what you wanted to say
But we will always make it this way
You know
It's worth more than a heartbeat fades

A voice on, take all the
I recognise words for her
Not surprised though it's harder
Small shadow, and wasted under

Maybe your silence will tell me what I need
Till I find what you're hiding from me
Maybe, the angels have got you too
I'm you can't say what you wanted to say
But we will always make it this way
You know
It's worth more than a heartbeat fades

We're not found, sun it rise
Hate me, how should be
To make every woman me
We're not found, sun it rise
Hate me, how should be
To make every woman me
