I may be leaving, but it's okay
To say what you're feeling, but baby not for free
It's called direction
So many times I can see
That the way that you are is rubbing off on me
It's called direction

Did you realise it's not quite time
You look out the window, the trains keep rolling by
It's called direction

You're still in but then comes the evening
It's the best time of day, cause that's when you're on your own
It's called direction

Finding you face down I heard you say
No one needs to know anyway
The reasons why we're late
Finding you face down I heard you say
No one needs to know anyway
The things we did today

Holding on, but is that right?
You take me home but only on a night
It's called direction

Don't forget, we'll wait and see
They only ask because you are with me
Although we've got no direction

Finding you face down I heard you say
No one needs to know anyway
The reasons why we're late
Finding you face down I heard you say
No one needs to know anyway
The things we did today
