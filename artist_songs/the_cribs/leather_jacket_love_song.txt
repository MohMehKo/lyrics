10 years on and 2001 is long gone
So I didn't wanna write another leather jacket love song
But you were a drug I couldn't hide from
And I know, it's not the same for you

In truth you're a saving grace
But you never knew what
If I was born at all, I knew I was always born to lose.
But you were a drug I couldn't hide from
And I hope, it's not the same for you

In the dark of your city
I wonder if you ever call my name
And in boxes and drawers, I'll hide our memories
In case I need to live my life again

Of all the things I could've been spending time on
I didn't wanna write another leather jacket love song
But you were a drug I couldn't hide from
And I hope it's not the same for you
