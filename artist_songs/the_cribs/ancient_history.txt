Laid my cards on the table
So she could see the light
My efforts went wasted
Due to fallen night...
And I know
But by the end of the evening
I was in no doubt
Of all of the things
That you could live without
And i know...

I drag up ancient history
Hope that they'll forgive me

They had nothing but ego's
But they would multiply
All the reasons that i would try
That i know...
To be making it harder to be seen but oh,
Is it too much to ask for to be left alone?
Yeah i know

I drag up ancient history
Hope that they'll forgive me

Laid my cards on the table
so she could see the light
my efforts went wasted
due to fallen night
and i know...

I drag up ancient history
Hope that they'll forgive me
