All the meek you should rejoice
Now you've found your voice
If you can't beat them don't join them
Just post rumours on forums
And I heard that it's curtains
But I could not be certain
What's that? We're history?
Oh really, that's funny

And now, you think you're right
With your reluctance to accept us
But I know that will change
When it's cool to be an outsider

I've got problems with chancers
Like groupies with cameras
You come out like leeches
To bleed us, oh jesus
Oh yeah, and one more thing
Your tone is annoying
The city's got problems
Oh you do? Well come on

And now, you think you're right
With your reluctance to accept us
But I know that will change
When it's cool to be an outsider

And I get off my face
'cos I was always uncertain
But tonight, all that will change
I'll be a new person
