With your knife and your bottle and silver spoon
No one knows what you're going to do
So stay away from everything that isn't true
Cause when I hung around with someone else
Take your anger off the shelf
And arrange it in a way that no one else could do
But you

Cause if you're dying I'd like to know
And if you're on one I need to show
Cause you were saying you was alone
Well there's something you need to know

I'm sixteen and I'm really bored
"But we're not going to use you we're
just scared we're gonna lose you"
Things are better when you are on board
I'm sure

But if you're dying I'd like to know
And if you're on one I need to show
Cause you were saying you was alone
Well there's something you need to know

That you will always be my hero
With the way that you're letting go
And you were saying you was alone
Well there's something you need to know
