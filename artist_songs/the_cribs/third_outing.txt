What's the best thing about here?
It's not the place, it's the people!
But you wouldn't know, cause your people are not us
It's pretty funny what happened

And I wonder, if you'll remember
The time we spent together?
And I wonder if you liked us all the time?
And I'll move on to this next one
This next one is the wrong one
And I wonder what you see when you're blind?

Outside it's cold and it's warm
My favourite place so far is where I am
The best things in life are free but I've paid up
Because I forgot what it was I was on about

And I wonder, if you'll remember
The time we spent together?
And I wonder if you'll feel bad in time?
And you'll always find a problem
When I am locked in boredom
But that's the way my life tends to be

And here it comes
The bit we've already played many times
Here it is one more time again it's third outing
Yeah, Wooo

And this is the end
End of record
