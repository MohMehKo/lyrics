Well I've been drinking for days and I'm happy to say
That we've been leading you on so you'd do it our way
You've had a little success but you're too hard to impress
So raise your standards, change your number
It's for the best
And thought I don't want you to stay
There's something about the way that
You say the words that you've rehearsed, now
I think I should explain
Things aren't gonna change
And last October when it took over
The boy was grabbed by his new controller
I'm shifting all the blame
But I still I feel the same

I didn't know what to say when I saw you alone
You say you do what you want but you do what you're told
I fell in love with you gaze, I fell in love with your name
We need to know what to say if we're playing your games

And though I don't want you to stay
There's something about the way that
You say the words that you've rehearsed, now
I think I should explain
Things aren't going to change
And last October when it took over
The boy was grabbed by his new controller
I'm shifting all the blame
But still I feel the same, yeah

And although it makes no difference I still know that
It's got nothing to do with the way I'm without you
