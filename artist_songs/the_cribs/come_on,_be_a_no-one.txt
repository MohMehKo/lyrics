Come on, I'll be a no one
New way

Got you wrong, it's not your fault
Sometimes I'd rather be a cheat
You can't keep circling me
Case I'm trying so hard to win joy every minute
Serious we are really well
We don't need you like a hole in the head

Come on, I'll be a no one
New way
Pay all the greatest sorrow
New way

Shooting star, change of heart
Something that you rarely see
Smell the lilies on me
Oh yeah

Wrong side, color inclined
That calls be...
Serious we are really well
We don't need you like a hole in the head

Come on, I'll be a no one
New way
Pay all the greatest sorrow
New way
New way
