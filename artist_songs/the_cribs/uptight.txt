Tonight it seems unsure
If I’d made it up but then
We got nine hours or more
It makes no difference
Cos that thought drifts right in
On a Foehn wind
And tries to take me back
So I might have to go
Oh no

No-one has to tell me
I know I have to let it go
But it’s so nice
Being uptight
So sorry that I never will be
the kind of guy you’d like
but it’s so nice
Being uptight

Been treated like a sister
but here’s something she don’t know
In her basement hangs a picture
that fucked my heart up
A memory takes my hand
a real gentleman
in every way but one
that I don’t wanna know
Oh no

No-one has to tell me
I know I have to let it go
but it’s so nice
Being uptight
So sorry that I never will be
the kind of guy you’d like
but it’s alright
being uptight

Got a name, all that remains
some day you know this back will break
We’re not a million miles away
Some day you know this back will break
