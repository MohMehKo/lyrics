By the time they lost him,
They'd realised he was a good lad.
He no longer goes to parties,
ços last time hurt bad.
Yeah they were all laughing,
Talking behind his back.
They said he'd been asking strange things like this:
'Do you love me?' No
Well don't say that ços
shit on your doorstep and you'll lose us.

This drivers clueless, he stopped outside the station and said
'Let's be having you out, you can't do that son'
When I'm drunk I can be an arsehole,
But that don't mean I've got no class no,
Why can't we have something going on?

You think about others too much,
Well that's a strange put down.
ços no-one has the same opinions, so where's the harm in asking
'Do you love me?' No
Well don't say that ços
shit on your doorstep and you'll lose us.

This drivers clueless, he stopped outside the station and said
'Let's be having you out, put that back son'
When I'm drunk I can be an arsehole,
But that don't mean I've got no class no,
Why can't we have something going on?

And I dont know if anyone cares or not,
But I have never liked you idiots,
Why can't we have something going on?

You're gonna lose us
