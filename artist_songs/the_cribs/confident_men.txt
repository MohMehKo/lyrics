It was a purry scurry fruit
What did I do?
I signed all and more I didn’t approve
Although I move I

But that is something I just can’t pretend
I’m feeling better that I won’t confess
Our ways we need the end
Our ways

Burning two suns like you knowingly
More than I should

E-mail’s the trail we both receive
More than I would
They want excuses for the things I never did
I may have kissed but the moon will shine
What you know, I can
No way

It’s spinning with waltz and I find out something
That he wanted two of you
He was a go

The e-mail we drown and both receive
For your own good
I’ll tell you something I just can’t pretend
I’m feeling better that I won’t confess
What can we aim react
But wait
I wait
