Without love
Without hate
Oh without anyone who I even allowed
To find out all of the little things
I've been thinkin
It's too easy for folks to get by
There's no reason for someone to try
To put walls around our misery
And gently emasculate me

You were seen
On your knees
Oh breaking what was
Already half destroyed
Like your love and all of the pretty things
That went with it

Spent all this time chasing happy
But happy is boring to me
So put walls around our misery
And gently emasculate me
