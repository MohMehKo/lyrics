Waiting for my friend to wake up
So we can talk in the night
like the old days

Though you like the songs I sing to you
all the words they are untrue
but I'll promise, just like I always do
though you like the songs I sing to you
all the words are no longer true
but I'll promise, just like I always do

I need to see the world
through her eyes now
It seems she thinks
all leaves are butterflies now

Though you like the songs I sing to you
all the words they are untrue
but I'll promise, just like I always do
though you like the songs I sing to you
all the words are no longer true
but I'll promise, just like I always do
