The wrong time, the wrong place
Your talent scouts my lonely face
Of all the things i can't replace
Your talent scouts my lonely face
Yeah

Well it's alright, although i know you lied
I don't mind
It's alright, although i know you lied
I don't mind

The wrong time, the wrong place
Your talent scouts my lonely face
Of all the things i can't escape
Your talent scouts my lonely face
Yeah

Well i'm alright, although i know you lied
I don't mind
If my life flashed before my eyes
Do you think I'd mind?
No

And now, you don't need mine
You let us down
You watched us die
Now, I hang around
With people i don't even know
