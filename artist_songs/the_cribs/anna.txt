Anna, you ever wonder why I’m here?
To sit and call the girl queen’s man
Is it awkward?
Or our fake friends
Some of the spaces before
Ashore

And I was only asking for what I knew is mine
And I was only asking for what I knew is mine
But I could never ask for what is that not right
But I would always ask for

Anna, I know you worry
Whatever
I think I'll do it all tonight
You can’t play right
By the way
I’m kicking the signs off the stone
the stone oh oh

And I was only asking for what I knew is mine
And I was only asking for what I knew is mine
But I could never ask for what is that not right
But I would always ask for her

I’m right with who I’d wanna be
so what made you change?
Oh oh wait , I'm not yet who I want to be
So what made you change?
