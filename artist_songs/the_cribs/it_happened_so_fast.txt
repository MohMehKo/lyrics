Don't go home, fine by me
But you just lost your dignity
Living in the dusty room
Staying in and making moves
So someones had enough, someones had too much
Imagine being like that, it must be bloody awful
But I know that it's hard to see
You should stay away from me
'Cos

In your eyes, in my heart
I still need you
Like I always have
I know that
You don't have anyone but you

You always said once was not enough
Everytime we go for a second try
Now I know, that it happened so fast
You always said once was not enough
Everytime we go for a second try
Now I know, that it happened so fast

Living in the dusty room
Staying in and making moves
It'd be fun, just remember why
You live you die, you lie you die
You're right

In your eyes, in my heart
I still need you
Like I always have
Are you on, a side, or not

You always said once was not enough
Everytime we go for a second try
Now I know, that it happened so fast
You always said once was not enough
Everytime we go for a second try
Now I know, that it happened so fast
