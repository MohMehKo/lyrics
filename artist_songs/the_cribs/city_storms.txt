There's some powers on the slide
I've been on worry side
But the pressure always ends

We've gone for hours now
Where every second counts
Cause I won't be around
For too long, oho

I'm scared of the truth
Oho, never heard my call
Stuck in the city storms
Oho, stuck in the city storms

Do you remember what it was like?
To be electric in the night
And the tears at the dawn
And the moments of calm
I hold you in my arms
But you went close back on
And what can we do
But talk about what it might
Be like when we're there
We change our tune

I'm scared of the truth
Oho, never heard my call
Stuck in the city storms
Oho, stuck in the city storms

I'm scared of the truth
Oho, never heard my call
Stuck in the city storms
Oho, stuck in the city storms
