I was born in 'The Merrie City'
I've been trying to get out of it
Nothing's changed since the 1950's
I'm surprised all the time what I find out

There must be something more

Can't figure it out
Still missing something
and I've tried everything

Love is a lie
Attraction, an instinct
Believe what you like, you decide
But I still think that

There must be something more

Can't figure it out
Still missing something
and I've tried everything
Three months ago
I ran to Brighton
It didn't solve anything... no

I thought it would not be a problem
But I found out the night we rode the Circle Line
It had to happen sometime
I thought it would not be a problem
But I found out the night we rode the Circle Line
It had to happen sometime
And though you knew nowt about it
You could pick up on signs
Like being too polite
And unassertive 'cos I'm
Still missing something
and I've tried everything
