It's not easy
But it's harder to just admit it
So it's all go through
But I don't need this
Or the mess I make
But I don't believe it
Cause I know I'll be safe by my own

Hand in hand, we will never understand
That all along, I was always Mr. Wrong
But I want you to believe that it's alright
I'm believing it's alright, when we've met

Even all these words, I know we all mean it
Spending all this time, cannot remake
Oh there's something else, think it reset
So I know I'll be safe by my own

Hand in hand, we will never understand
That all along, I was always Mr. Wrong
But I want you to believe that it's alright
I'm believing it's alright, when we've met

Just can't seem to see myself
Sleeping in the face that's forever
Even though it's dark down there
I'm growing into something weaker
Living on the side of it

Hand in hand, we will never understand
That all along, I was always Mr. Wrong
But I want you to believe that it's alright
I'm believing it's alright, when we've met
