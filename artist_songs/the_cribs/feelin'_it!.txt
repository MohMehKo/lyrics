Feelin' it in the bathroom,
stumbilin' to the floor
and I'm finding it hard to tell you,
what my name is

and I'm wanting to recline

and the circumstances change
from the ones i know about
and you can't win

and I'm feelin kind of strange
just leave me on my face
with me and no one else

I think I should let you know
that I'll probably be a no show.
But you're gonna have to ring and let me know
if you're wantin me on the side

feelin' it in the kitchen,
somethings burning on the grill
and I'm finding it hard to tell you
where my flat is

and pictures always fade
and I don't remember it this way
and I cant win

I think I should let you know
that I'll probably be a no show.
But you're gonna have to ring and let me know
if you're wantin me on the side
