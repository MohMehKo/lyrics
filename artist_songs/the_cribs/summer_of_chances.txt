Forget the false
Experts with all the answers
Was there something you
Wanted to ask?
In the summer of chances

If you thought you'd hurt her
Would you take it back?
Never get a chance if something ever happens
Yeah
Nature versus nurture
Which one is the stronger?

We're all seeing differently
You've come back for me
In the summer of chances
Which one, how it used to be
We won't be what we
In the summer of chances

Fell in love
With the sordid starts
Even though they make you crazy
In time it's true
You'll get something back
Of the time you were the leading lady

If you thought you'd hurt her
Would you take it back?
Never get a chance if something ever happens
Yeah
Nature versus nurture
Which one is the stronger?
Are you living this way because you think you have to?

You've come back for me
In the summer of chances
Which one, how it used to be
We won't be what we
