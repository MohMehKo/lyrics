If you combine flattery
With a long history
Then there are no easy answers
You hid your face
You hid your face in a place
Where there are no easy answers

In the name of everyone who met me
Am I supposed to commit Hari Kari?
With sword in hand I face demands
Delivered with the best intentions
from the department of corrections
But who will tell my next of kin
That tomorrow stands for nothing?

It was years ago, it was years ago
Since you left us
Alone
It was years ago, it was years ago
And only time will show, only time will show
How much you mean to
The world
Only time will show
It was years ago

If you combine flattery
With a long history
Then there are no easy answers
You hid your face
You hid your face in a place
Where there are no easy answers

Somebody said you should have left her
I think it was an empty gesture
It's not as though they really cared, like
"It's a shame about the weather"
You left home on a stretcher
I remember cos I saw a picture of it

It was years ago, it was years ago
Since you left us
I know
It was years ago, it was years ago
And only time will show, only time will show
How much you mean to
The world
Only time will show
It was years ago
