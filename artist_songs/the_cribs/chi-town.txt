Meet me down in Chi-Town, in Logan Square underground
You know the one, we were always there.
Meet me down in Chi-Town, in Logan Square underground
You know the one, we were always there.

Forget the airport and cut my hair short
Eat cookies and cream from the store at the end of the street,
There's so much junk in my head, will I only be here when you're dead?
But I'll still think of you to take it out on myself.

Meet me down in Chi-Town, in Logan Square underground
You know the one, we were always there.
Meet me down in Chi-Town, in Logan Square underground
You know the one, we were always there.

At the end of the rainbow, I took a photo
At my [?] do you call that [?] show I want
These things, I was here and now I know I won't return
But still I think of you and to take it out on everyone else.

Meet me down in Chi-Town, in Logan Square underground
You know the one, we were always there.
