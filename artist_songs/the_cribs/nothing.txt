Lasted longer, well that's enough
Promises honoured, acting tough
Lasted longer, well that's enough

It's easy to feel strong about something
Of which no-one else knows a single thing
Who would remember a down turned mouth?

We start with next to nothing, why?
Just like we all had lost them, why?
When I die I'm leaving nothing, why?
We start with next to nothing, why?

I won't put myself out on show
And I won't dance round no maypole
No more chance than a cat in hell

We start with next to nothing, why?
Just like we all had lost them, why?
When I die I'm leaving nothing, why?
We start with next to nothing, why?
