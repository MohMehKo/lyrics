And I'm learning how to fight
kissing you goodnight
But I still can't really tell you why I'm blue
And I'm learning how to fight
Kissing you goodnight
And the reasons you'll never really find

You took me out to breakfast
I guess that means that's better
But in your room I still know what to do

And now I know I've got to
Do all these things without you
Although I don't ...
It still tells me what to do, yeah!

And I'm learning how to fight
Kissing you goodnight
But I still can't really tell you why I'm blue

And I'm learning how to fight
Kissing you goodnight
And the reasons you'll never really find

You took me out in the night too
I'd have to see what I'd do
because when I do it, then we do it all!
because that's what I'm like with you

And now I know you've gone home
Back to wherever you came from
And all I've got is a song
On a record I don't even own, aaaah!

And I'm learning how to fight
Kissing you goodnight
But I still can't really tell you bout my blues

And I'm learning how to fight
Kissing you goodnight
And the reasons you'll never really fi-i-ind
Find, find, fi-i-i-iind
