It came to me like a voice from above
Or like a message in praise of platonic love
And if you stand in the booth
Then you don't have to sit with a stranger
A perfumed gust drifts to my core
I give you one last look
Through a cross-hatched door
But I'm a messed up baby
Like the Berlin Wall
Tonight
It came to me like a voice from above
Or like a message in praise of platonic love
But I'm a messed up baby
Like the Berlin Wall
Tonight

You feel the rape in the city of bugs
Fill the hole with glass...
...Vessels burst after love
But don't go too long without letting them know
That you're there
A perfumed gust drifts to my core
I give it one last look
It was a cross-hatched door
But I'm a messed up
Baby I'm the Berlin Wall
Tonight

You came into reach
Like the Serpent and Peach
Came to me in the dream
That contractions set free
But it's never too late to admit to me
That you're worried
Never a choice
Don't remember your voice
I was born out of glass
I'll return there at last
In a shattering climax

The wall falls

It came to me like a voice from above
Or like a message in praise of platonic love
And if you stand in the booth
Then you don't have to sit with a stranger
You feel the rape of the city of bugs
So fill the hole with glass...
...Vessels burst after love
But don't go too long without letting them know
That you're there

Never a choice
Don't remember your voice
I was born out of glass
I'll return there at last
In a shattering climax
For left out children to carry
A world without sin is a laughable thing
So go out on a limb
Take a stone for a swim
In a shattering climax

The wall falls
