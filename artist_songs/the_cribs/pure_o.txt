Pure O
You had me hurting
You should know that
I was certain in my head
When you know, you know
I can’t change

God-damn the times I thought of nothing
but the things I couldn’t prove
So perfect in my devising
I load it all on you
and your lonely heart, under pressure
a petal in a book
I carry this around, for luck
Cos I’ve got something I can’t say

Pure O
You have me hurting
You should know that
I was certain in my head
When you know, you know
and that’s the main thing
You should know that
I was certain in my head

Protect me still my treasured secret
In ways misunderstood
She keeps me still with over-thinking
I’d love to hold you but
My hands were tied so the chance was wasted
the thousandth never took
I carry this around

Cos I’ve got something I cant say

Pure O, oh I have wasted
So many years just on the same trip
Late night favour
Yeah I was nervous
that she don’t know yet
if I was only part-time
