You knew what to make
But I’d listen to you’d say

Just like money in my wallet
I got bruises on my knees
Without your mad thoughts
The point
Was lost
Our jaded youth

To talk these words that they
So say you reach down at the end of my sleeve
The bird curse the days I’ve got her
It’s playing on my mind
If I went back to school
Would I feel peal?
I’ll go

Like the time that you were told
The young people fucked you hoe
Die in hell and fuckin’ basher
I’ve got nowhere to go
Since a long long time ago
Since I was looking for a piece of the action

You’d be the one to make
I never looked to a word you said

Just like money in my wallet
I got bruises on my knees
Without your mad thoughts
The point
Was lost
Our jaded youth

Like the time that you were told
The young people fucked you hoe
Die in hell and fuckin’ basher
I’ve got nowhere to go
Since a long long time ago
Since I was looking for a piece of the action
Our jaded youth, yea

And I need time
Or a tunnel walk these words
A sick song heard at the lost and found, yea
You would love them hard

Like the time that you were told
The young people fucked you hoe
Die in hell and fuckin’ basher
I’ve got nowhere to go
Since a long long time ago
Since I was looking for a piece of the action
Our jaded youth, fuckin’ whore
The truth, yea
