Why can't I be like the one who went over?
It's over, get over, woah-oh
Why can't I be like the one who went over?
It's over, get over, woah-oh

Thought it wasn't right to tease me
When no one was around
And you turned me up, and you broke my heart
And you said, yeah you heard every sound

Got really hot in the morning
So I went to blow me down
And you don't know when the lights went out
But the lights are out now

Don't know what you do, but oh

Why can't I be like the one who went over?
It's over, get over, woah-oh
Why can't I be like the one who went over?
It's over, get over, woah-oh

Supposed to connect some New York boys
Would have had to go way out of town
And I want no drugs, couldn't get the stuff
And you know what, I think they hate me now

Got really hot in the morning
So I went to blow me down
And you don't know when the lights went out
But the lights are out now

Don't know what you do, but oh

Why can't I be like the one who went over?
It's over, get over, woah-oh
Why can't I be like the one who went over?
It's over, get over, woah-oh
Why can't I be like the one who went over?
It's over, get over, woah-oh
Why can't I be like the one who went over?
It's over, get over, woah-oh
