Cut to the scene of a broken dream
On a day of long shadows
Tree lined streets, not even on the map
Summer early evening glows

Then ask your friends if you can learn to enjoy sorrow
See you told her once,
You told her twice,
And now she's found herself with no tomorrow

You see the truth's unfair
Home at last,
Is anybody there?
No.
There's been no proof, who cares
Alone at last,
Is anybody there?
No, no, no.

In the light's part of me
Don't lie,
That should feel/be/feel alright

Cut to the scene of a broken dream
On a day of long shadows
You went there once,
Never looked back
What's not right, I'll never know

Then ask your friends if they could learn to enjoy sorrow
You might be tough,
Yeah I know your type,
Until you find yourself with no tomorrow

You see the truth's unfair
Home at last,
Is anybody there?
No.
There's been no proof, who cares
Alone at last,
Is anybody there?
No, no, no.

In the light's part of me
Don't lie,
That should feel/be/feel alright

You see the truth's unfair
Home at last,

No.

No, no, no.

In the light's part of me
Don't lie,
That should feel/be/feel alright

Home at last,

No.
