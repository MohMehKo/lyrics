When I was young I came upon
A girl I met
Now she wakes up just to see
King's Cross scum beat down on me

Saturday night facts of life
At the knuckle, it's alright
It's you and me
You and me

Come down properly, out they came
Standing in the pouring rain
Wounded colours and battered knees
To see those things that I can see

Saturday night facts of life
At the knuckle, it's alright
It's you and me
You and me

Just can't feel alright (you know you can)
Just can't feel alright (you know you can)
Just can't feel alright (you know you can)
Just can't feel alright (you know you can)
