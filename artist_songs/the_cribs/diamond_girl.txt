Underneath your rainbow
You bring me too my knees
You keep me up at midnight
Till the end of the day at least
You don't have to hear the blood screams
Of those living out their dreams
So it makes no sense to you
How they end up like they do
Like they do

Sometimes I wonder if I got you wrong
You don't have to agree
We're all as straight as you want us to
Diamond girl how did you get so free?
You're not as straight as they want you to be
Always be you and I'll always be me
We'll never be as straight as they want us to be
Got you wrong, you don't have to agree

Find me in the city where no one knows my name
We can pick up where we left off
I'm so happy that you came
Even in this body, no stones in my mind
Still the same as always
And I'll always be where you are
Oh where you are

Sometimes I wonder if I got you wrong
You don't have to agree
We're all as straight as you want us to
Diamond girl how did you get so free?
You're not as straight as they want you to be
Always be you and I'll always be me
We'll never be as straight as they want us to be
Got you wrong, you don't have to agree

Diamond girl how did you get so free?

Foil wrapped in a blister pack
Gotta get my freedom back
Foil wrapped in a blister pack
I have gotta get my freedom back

Sometimes I wonder if I got you wrong
You don't have to agree
We're all as straight as you want us to
Diamond girl how did you get so free?
You're not as straight as they want you to be
Always be you and I'll always be me
We'll never be as straight as they want us to be
Got you wrong, you don't have to agree
