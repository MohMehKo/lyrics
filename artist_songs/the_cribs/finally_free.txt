The necklace that brought to be free
I sell myself, you change me
But we all moved on
And I did try to keep my will strong
So why do I still dream of your house?
I can't go, throwing up the side out
And the pavement, of the street looks all odd
It still feels it's the place I belong

Stand out while we're free
Well, it come back to me
Now I want it, again
It's what, it's what, it's what, it's what
It's what, it's what I want

Even that's wrong, the freedom
Watch the feel once pull
Before it falls
Been wrong for long
Convinced too that wasn't something
It was just my own

Now I'm finally free
But why all it comes back to me?
Now I want it, again
It's what, it's what, it's what, it's what
It's what, it's what I want

I don't know what to think
Just know it's everything
Plastic lets me, no matter where we're in
Just want you that show the person
Sat next to me, oho
That I never know, yeah!

Now I'm finally free
But why all it comes back to me?
Now I want it, again
It's what, it's what, it's what, it's what
It's what, it's what I want
