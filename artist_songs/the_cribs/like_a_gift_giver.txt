Little birds in a box of tea
just waiting to die
Like a gift giver I will change the way
that you see, or I’ll try

But I know, it’s not even
but try when you’re in Heaven
to call me up

It’s hard to believe in anything
that I’ve learned in my life
but whisper something trivial
that sounds good and I might

But I know, it’s not even
but try when you’re in Heaven
to call me up
