I went to bed the very first time
We talked the same
We were talking about the things
That really get her down 
Woah-oh, Woah-oh, I want you to remind me
Woah-oh, Woah-oh, I want you to remind me 

I went to bed but spent too long
Looking round
We were talking about the things
That really get me down 

Woah-oh, Woah-oh, I want you to remind me
Woah-oh, Woah-oh, I want you to remind me
Woah-oh, Woah-oh, I want you to remind me
Woah-oh, Woah-oh, I want you to remind me
Woah-oh, Woah-oh, I want you to remind me
Woah-oh, Woah-oh, I want you to remind me
Woah-oh, Woah-oh, I want you to remind me
Woah-oh, Woah-oh, I want you to remind me

Why does it always happen like this?
