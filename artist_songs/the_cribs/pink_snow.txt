But were you better on your own?
To all my sisters I promise you this that
I’ll try and be brave for you
I’ll try and be brave for you
You’re sitting behind those walls
No one to visit, head full of regret
And sometimes I forget too
And you don’t even have a clue
Were you better on your own?
To all my sisters I promise you this that
I’ll try and be brave for you
I’ll try and be brave for you...yeah

As someone you’ll never know
Do you picture me alone?
Now the bird that sung has flown
Do you picture me alone?
[x2]

But were you better on your own?
To all my sisters I promise you this that
I’ll try and be brave for you
I’ll try and be brave for you
And maybe I’ll never know
But something tells me that somewhere in Maryland
A cherry blossom grows
Bury me with pink snow
Were you better on your own?
To all my sisters I promise you this that
I’ll try and be brave for you
I’ll try and be brave for you...yeah

As someone you’ll never know
Do you picture me alone?
Now the bird that sung has flown
Do you picture me alone?
[x2]

But were you better on your own?
To all my sisters I promise you this that
I’ll try and be brave for you
I’ll try and be brave for you
Brave for you

Bury me with pink snow...
