You are far more likely to
Be devoured
Than empowered by your own
Sense of romance

Oh doleful girl
Alone in the world?
Where did true love go?
Well I'd like to know, ohhh-ohh

This means everything to me
Hope someone will see
That those yesterdays were a lifetime ago

You are far more likely to
Be devoured
Than empowered by your own
Sense of romance

Even the most gentle of folk
Will snap when provoked
I ain't scared no more
I've said that before

I sense it on your breath
You're frozen in your depths
Where'd the good guys go?
Well I'd like to know

Save your secrets for those who deserve it
But like the rice pounded out by a rabbit
I'm miles away from ever understanding
Why I had to be more of a man then
