It's a lie, it's fake, but it's the dream, living outside of your means
And all you want is that you'll never be
Tommorow always comes too fast, the first to leave still came in last
And how much longer till this time has passed? Oh no...

Cos you can't go taking it back - there's no time and no place for that
But don't you wanna be relevant? Oh no
It's a double-sided attack but that's all I had, don't make me laugh cos it's not

Fought so real, hard to beat, men that I see in the street
People I don't ever wanna be
The lovers, they're the lonely ones, they're lost and blinded by their day in the sun
How much longer til our war is won? Oh no.. wooo!

Cos you can't go taking it back - there's no time and no place for that
But don't you wanna be relevant? Oh no
Cos it's a double-sided attack but that's all I had, don't make me laugh cos it's not

Your onstage antics out in Leed were tailor-made to suit men's needs [x2]

Cos you can't go taking it back - there's no time and no place for that
But don't you wanna be relevant? Oh no
Cos it's a double-sided attack but that's all I had, don't make me laugh cos it's not
