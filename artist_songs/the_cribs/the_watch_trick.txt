And now I know in my mind
its time to feel round
cos that is the best way to deal this I find.
Oh I don't know
time goes so slow
and maybe its time to let go I don't know.
I know its not right
Now i must wake i know i must take you home.
How can I feel right
when you are the one
that I like to see and be with on a night
and all that I ask
dont give your self away to easy.
Dont give yourself to me
now I know its not right my friend
now I must wake i know i must take you home
now i must take you home
always i go alone
if you want to id like to stay
cos if you always insist
i will have to resist cos noone likes that anyway
