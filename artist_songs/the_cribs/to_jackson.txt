You're getting away from yourself
You're getting away, oh woah ohohohoh
You're getting away from yourself
You're getting away, oh woah ohohohoh 
I saw something pretty today
The sky was just running away, oh woah ohohohoh
I think I was supposed to be scared
But I'm feelin okay, oh woah ohohohoh 

It got to the time when you'd walk
Now it's late in the day
I look for cigarette butts you threw away
I never saw you looking behind
Now I know I don't mind 

You're getting away from yourself
You're getting away, oh woah ohohohoh
You're getting away from yourself
You're getting away, oh woah ohohohoh 

I'm thinking that you left me behind
So, I've nothing to say
But get yourself through the day, then fall away
I've missed out once in my life
Now I know I don't mind 

It got to the time when you'd walk
After only one day
I look for cigarette butts you threw away
I've missed out once in my life
Now I know I don't mind
