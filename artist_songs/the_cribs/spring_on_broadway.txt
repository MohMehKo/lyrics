I know I could be right
But it's worth more than my life
Had to leave some time
Though it's not done yet
Replaced by passers by
I'm sure you'll forget
Sure that she's right
I just walked past her

Like spring on broadway
It don't matter
Oh hey
In my door, now the way

Never want to guard you
Don't be sad baby
You need which one to be
Never want to guard you
Don't be sad baby
You need which one to be
Never want to guard you
Don't be sad baby
You need which one to

And all these things I've missed
In the years I did exist
Don't ask me why
I'm feeling presence
Factions of the sky
My head went
Never felt so fine
Though I'm in a safe place
Spring on broadway, as I search for your face
I guess I'm just too late

Never want to guard you
Don't be sad baby
You need which one to be
Never want to guard you
Don't be sad baby
You need which one to be
Never want to guard you
Don't be sad baby
You need which one to
