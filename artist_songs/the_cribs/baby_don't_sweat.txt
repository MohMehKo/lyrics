Now and again I've got a lot to say
And I can't afford you this one
Oh yeah, she asks me where I'm going
Now and again I'll find a friend who knows
She asks me where I'm going
Oh yeah, she asks me where I'm going
Well if you're always in debt
Baby don't sweat
I promise it will always be fine
I'll never forget
I'm always in debt
Baby you opened my mind

Now and again I've got a lot to say
And I can't afford you this one
Oh yeah, she asks me where I'm going
Now and again I'll find a friend who knows
She asks me where I'm going
Oh yeah, she asks me where I'm going

Well if you're always in debt
Baby don't sweat
I promise you it'll always be fine
I'll never forget
I'm always in debt to you
Baby you opened my mind

So if you're always in debt
Baby don't sweat
I promise you'll always be fine
I'll never forget you
I'm always in debt to you
Harder you blew my mind

Now and again I've got a lot to say
And I can't afford you this one
Oh yeah, she asks me where I'm going
Now and again I find a friend who knows
She asks me where I'm going
Oh yeah, she asks me where I'm going
