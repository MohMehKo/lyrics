She had a triple six tattoo,
kinda scared me for a minute.
She said "I really really like you"
before I knew it I was in it

She had a white smile, black hair,
took my hand and let me up the darkest stairs.
When I open up my eyes she is on top of me,
coming at for a bite.

Then she stopped and said
I love this life
But it only lasts a minute
And do you love this life?
Cuz if you do, 
I promise I can make it last forever,
forever
forever
forever

Woke up, it was daylight
when no one's hoping she was missing.
Something came up with me last night,
I think I'm falling for a vision.
And now I know I gotta have her,
even if it means I gotta live forever,
So I find her in the dark,
open up my heart, begging to be mine.

She pulled me in and said
I love this life
But it only lasts a minute
And do you love this life?
Cuz if you do, I promise I can make it last forever
forever
forever
forever
I promise I can make it last forever
forever
forever
forever

If you stay right here and live for the night,
we can light up the darkness together.
If you stay right here and live for the night,
if you fall in my arms and surrender.

I promise I can make it last forever!
hey!

I promise I can make it last forever
