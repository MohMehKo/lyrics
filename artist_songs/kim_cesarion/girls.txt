D'you wanna go home?
I said what you think?
She turned to the bar
She said one more drink, Pink
We're about to go down to this other place
You can come if you like, cause it's open late

Now she's dancing on the tables
Dancing out of reach
Kickin' all the bottles up
To the beat, yeah
D'you wanna come down?
I said what you think?
She said I think I'll be up here for a while

All the guys in the building
You might learn something
From the girls and the women
If you just let go
You should do it too

Girls!
All they wanna do is have fun
I'm watching them girls
All they wanna do is have fun
Wanna party, party, party
Party til' they die
Party til' the sun comes up
I'm watching them girls
All they wanna do is have fun

D'you wanna go back to a state of mind?
We can take something out and just chill at mine, fine
Get close on the couch, put my record on
She said maybe little later, I gotta meet someone

Now she's dancing on the tables
Dancing out of reach
Ordering another sex, on the beach
D'you wanna come down?
I said what you think?
She said I'm gonna get high as a satellite

Girls!
All they wanna do is have fun
I'm watching them girls
All they wanna do is have fun
Wanna party, party, party
Party til' they die
Party til' the sun comes up
I'm watching them girls
All they wanna do is have fun

Then she told me, she could want me
But only as a friend
Cause she's beautiful, with no make up on
And I want her more and then
Then she told me that the party never ends

All the guys in the building
You might learn something
From the girls and the women
If you just let go
You should do it too

Girls!
All they wanna do is have fun
I'm watching them girls
All they wanna do is have fun
Wanna party, party, party
Party til' they die
Party til' the sun comes up
I'm watching them girls
All they wanna do is have fun
I'm watching them girls
All they wanna do is have fun
