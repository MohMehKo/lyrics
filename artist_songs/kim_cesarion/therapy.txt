The past is the past
Could you be the future?
You're striking a match
You're making the darkness go
Don't even ask
You know what I'm here for
Baby, you can do whatever

Gotta take this slowly cause I'm broken
Shows up from the one who came before
Going with this feeling till it's over
Till it's over

I think I need your therapy
Just lay your hands all over me
Come on and set my body free
I think I need your therapy, your therapy

You know where to touch
I follow your fingers
You don't have to watch
To care on me all night long
Don't think too much
Just stay in the moment
Baby this could be forever

Gotta take this slowly cause I'm broken
Shows up from the one who came before
Going with this feeling till it's over
Till it's over (till it's over)

I think I need your therapy
Just lay your hands all over me (I think I need your therapy, yeah)
Come on and set my body free
I think I need your therapy, your therapy

Hey!
Your therapy, your therapy, ooh
Your therapy, all over me
(I need your therapy)
Your therapy, your therapy
Till it's over, till it's over

Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Gotta take this slowly cause I'm broken
Yeah-yeah
Going with this feeling till it's over
Till it's over

I think I need your therapy (hey!)
Just lay your hands all over me (all over me)
Come on and set my body free (set my body free)
I think I need your therapy, your therapy

Your therapy, your therapy, (your therapy)
Your therapy, all over me (all over me)
Your therapy, your therapy
Till it's over, till it's over (till it's over baby)
