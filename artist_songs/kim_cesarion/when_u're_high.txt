Ooooh

Girl I hate it, I hate it, and love it at the same time
You're so faded, so faded, so far out of your mind
All my feelings, my feelings, I threw them in front of you
But you feel nothing, sweet nothing

But still I wait for the sound of my phone in the dark, after the clubs are closed
And I wait for the screetch from the cab in the street cause I know

You only call me in the night
You know that I'd do anything with you
Don't wanna give me all your time
Cause you only, only, Call me when you're high

I try pretending, pretending, but I couldn't keep up with you
Cuz girl you're crazy, so crazy, like you got nothing to lose
Still you say what you mean but it don't mean a thing, speaking out there on your own
And I wouldn't mind if you let me inside, but you won't

But still I wait for the sound of the ring in the night, right when the clubs are closed
And I wait for the screetch from the cab in the street cause I know

You only call me in the night
You know that I'd do anything with you
Don't wanna give me all your time
Cause you only, only, call me when you're high

Ooh! ooh!

You only call me in the night
You know that I'd do anything with you
Don't wanna give me all your time
Cause you only, only, call me when you're high

Call me in the night
You know that I'd do anything with you
Don't wanna give me all your time
Cuz you only, only, call me when you're high
