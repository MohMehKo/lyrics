I was a player
So good at bad behaviour
Girls up and down the elevator
Wouldn't see any of 'em later

They used to entertain me
But none of them could tame me
Girls they were screaming "Ooh baby"
While I was off in some kinda daydream

Sometimes it hits me completely, when I get high
Sometimes you get me completely, you got me

Hot damn, your mind's so beautiful
I'm struck dumb, don't know where my shit's at
Hot damn, you're intellectual
I'm struck dumb, how we gonna fix that?

Now that you got in my head,
Why don't you get in my bed?

Hot damn, your mind's so beautiful
I'm struck dumb
I wanna love your brains out

Uh uh oh no!
Can't believe I'm begging "Don't go"
But there's so much more I wanna know
Like everything about you

The clever words that you say
Every one does something new to me
Of all the girls that I used to call "baby"
You're the only one that gets through to me

Sometimes it hits me completely, when I get high
Sometimes you get me completely, you got me

Hot damn, your mind's so beautiful
I'm struck dumb, don't know where my shit's at
Hot damn, you're intellectual
I'm struck dumb, how we gonna fix that?

Now that you got in my head,
Why don't you get in my bed?

Hot damn, your mind's so beautiful
I'm struck dumb
I wanna love your brains out

I wanna love your brains, I wanna, I wanna love your brains out [x6]

You got me

Hot damn, your mind's so beautiful
I'm struck dumb, don't know where my shit's at
Hot damn, you're intellectual
I'm struck dumb, how we gonna fix that?

Now that you got in my head,
Why don't you get in my bed?

Hot damn, your mind's so beautiful
I'm struck dumb
I wanna love your brains out
