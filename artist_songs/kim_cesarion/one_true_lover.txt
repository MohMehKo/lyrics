Oh oh,

Butterfly kisses, kiss you all the time
Trace your silhouette all through the night
I can't help but touch ya, I'm never satisfied
Only to go deeper, alright
You do something to me, I just can't describe
There are thing that get me going out of my mind
All my seven senses you turn them up to ten
All over my body, never again

Don't wanna be your friend or your brother
We know how to touch one another
When we get under the covers
You're my one true lover
Of broken hearts, I've felt the pain
I know I'll never win again
When we get under the covers
You're my one true lover

I made a lot of mistakes the way that people do
Love the lot of faith on the way to something true
Some girls got to the doorstep, others turn a key
Lead you to that other part of me

Don't wanna be your friend or your brother
We know how to touch one another
When we get under the covers
You're my one true lover
Of broken hearts, I've felt the pain
I know I'll never win again
When we get under the covers
You're my one true lover

All my searchings through (through and through)
Ended here with you (yeah)
All my searchings through 
Leaded here with you

Don't wanna be your friend or your brother
We know how to touch one another
When we get under the covers
You're my one true lover
Of broken hearts, I've felt the pain
I know I'll never win again
When we get under the covers
You're my one true lover

Oh oh
