Breathe, breathe me in
Taste my words
Let me blow your mind
I'll take you far, far away
I'll make you feel alright

If there's a gun, you're the trigger baby
If there's a run, you're my leading lady
But you got me over, over here waiting
Girl you got my body cold, mind racing

I just wanna fly into the sky
With your angel wings
Baby then I wanna dive into the sunrise
Between your angel wings

Don't mind me I'm just lonely
And alone
Calling all night hoping you look at your phone
Don't judge me I'm just lonely
So come alone
You're the only one I want on my throne

Cause it ain't like I ain't got one
It ain't like I ain't got one
It ain't like I ain't got one
It ain't like I ain't got one
So take me within
Give me your sin

Breathe, breathe me in
Taste my words
Let me blow your mind
I'll take you far, far away
I'll make you feel alright

We got our moment so unfinished baby
Goes on forever
Cause it's measure daily
See my revolver dare to aim and shoot
Girl you got me floating
Where's the parachute

Baby I just wanna fly into the sky
With your angel wings
Baby then I wanna dive into the sunrise
Between your angel wings

Don't mind me I'm just lonely
And alone
Calling all night hoping you look at your phone
Don't judge me I'm just lonely
So come alone
You're the only one I want on my throne

Cause it ain't like I ain't got one
It ain't like I ain't got one
It ain't like I ain't got one
It ain't like I ain't got one
So take me within
Give me your sin

Breathe, breathe me in
Taste my words
Let me blow your mind
I'll take you far, far away
I'll make you feel alright
