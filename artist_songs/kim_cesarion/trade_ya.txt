We started out caught in 95
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
Tell me, tell me something I like
Cause baby you're gold, baby you're gold, oh oh

In the spotlight, the girls they're steamin'
It's a hot night, ooh-ooh-ooh
It's like head high, just being in the room witcha
Girl you got that asset that money can't buy

I wouldn't trade ya for a million, billion, trillion
I wouldn't trade ya for a million, billion, trillion
I wouldn't trade ya for a million, billion, trillion

Girl get up on the pedestal
I'm watchin' you now, watchin' you now
Cause your body's so medical
It ain't comin' down, ain't comin' down, oh oh

In the spotlight, the girls they're steamin'
It's a hot night, ooh-ooh-ooh
It's like head high, just being in the room witcha
Girl you got that asset that money can't buy

I wouldn't trade ya for a million, billion, trillion
I wouldn't trade ya for a million, billion, trillion
I wouldn't trade ya for a million, billion, trillion

I just need to tell ya I would never trade ya
I just need to tell ya I would never trade ya
I just need to tell ya I would never trade ya
I just need to tell ya I would never trade ya

Would never trade ya, would never, would never trade ya, baby

I wouldn't trade ya for a million, billion, trillion
I wouldn't trade ya for a million, billion, trillion

Look at you, look at you, look at you go
Look at you, look at you, look at you go
Look at you, look at you, look at you go
Look at you, look at you, look at you go...
