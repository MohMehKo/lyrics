I don't have the answer
Got a mind full of questions
A couple of confessions
And I wonder "What could you say today?"

See, I've got this problem
I know you've probably been there
I needed an opinion from you
What could you say today?

I want you to come down... tonight
I want you to come down... to me
Cause you're still a part of me

See, I had sex with
Sex with a girl that I never should've messed with
I didn't know at the time
There's another guy and he's a friend of mine

And he's in love with her
But everytime I see her, we fall a little deeper
It's a fucked up situation
And I need your guidance now more than ever

I want you to come down... tonight
I want you to come down... to me
Cause you're still a part of me
Cause you're still a part of me

You're still a part of me
You're still a part of me
But oh you're still a part of me
Ohh, ohhh...
