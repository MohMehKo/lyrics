Please don't get offended
The new F word, is forgive
I'mma say it again, The new F word, is forgive
Now that said, do me a favor, touch your neighbor and say: 'F you!'
Do me a favor, touch your neighbor and say: 'F you!'

If anybody here, has ever done it dumber than a dumb thing
If anybody here, has ever called a lover by the wrong name

You need an Amen (Amen!)
I think I fucked it up again (Amen!)

If anybody here has to have it all, talkin' 'stead of listening
If anybody here has ever threw your future off a building

You need an Amen (Amen!)
I think I fucked it up again (Amen!)

Everybody gets high, everybody gets low, everybody, if you feel me, let me know
All I want is some forgiveness from a girl I know
For the love, For the love
You need an Amen
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low, everybody, if you feel me, let me know
All I want is some forgiveness from a girl I know
For the love, For the love

You need an Amen (Amen!) [3x]
I think I fucked it up again

Has anybody here forgot to call when they promise they would check-in

Has anybody here been an idiot instead of been a best friend
Has anybody smell of perfume, after they been working
Has anybody hurt someone then felt like a piece of nothing

Everybody gets high, everybody gets low, everybody, if you feel me, let me know
All I want is some forgiveness from a girl I know
For the love, For the love
You need an Amen
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low, everybody, if you feel me, let me know
All I want is some forgiveness from a girl I know
For the love, For the love

You need an Amen (Amen!) [5x]
I think I fucked it up again
