I'll never find another I loved like you, 
You can't imagine all the pain I'm going through without you
I thought I had it all baby with you (yeah)
Everyday it's killing me that you're not my lady
Now that you've found some better for you
I miss the way it used to be back when you were my baby
Now that you've found some better for oohh
Yeah 

Can't love nobody fucked up over you
I Can't love somebody all night, all night no
I can't help it honey, tell me what to do?
Can't love nobody all night, all night no

Now I'm trying get you back in my bed
Without your love I can't go live it off
I'm better off dead
I thought we had it all I'm out of my hand

Cuz everyday it's killing me, that you're not my lady (not my lady)
Now you've found some better for you

Can't love nobody, fucked up over you
I can't love somebody all night, all night long
I can't help it honey, tell me what to do?
Can't love nobody all night, all night long
Can't love nobody, fucked up over you
Can't love somebody all night, all night long
