I know she love it when she touch my fir
And I'm so smooth I know it hurts
At the bar with the g's not the jerks
With the t's jeans and my crease
With the thousands ice in the mouth with the platinum mounts
and then after the club push the engines to the house with it
Nation wide

Out the H2 drivin like I'm in a hurry
Off the hypnotic ice ice like blurry
Got the back drivers seat chicks like worried
Hit the suites after arm rest play some blueberry
Relax ya mind let ya concious be free
Your now listenin with the sounds of the J-A-C
20 rounds under my shirt nobody knows
Cop the pose In my d-boy stance the girls froze tho
They love ya boy cause I come from the yay
A-R-E-A yeah boy that's where I'm from
Never sold a million records but my time will come
Gi-girlie in my whip and she kinda dumb
