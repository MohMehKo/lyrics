I control the yay but I can't control the day carry ya soul away when u cross the jack
Your soul u'll have to pay I control the K (AK-47) u want to control the bay but we not listenin
We can't hear u when u whisperin speak louder uz a coward u ain't out here nigga
We been out since the winter we'll be here when it returns in the hood all the time that's
A place u not concerned mayne we had it with u & ya career when u come back homie
We won't be here where did u go seems like forever since u been gone hop in my super coop
All I did was shoot the truth all my life real nigga misled youth I was breezing thru believed in u all my life
Saprano wata is there a heaven for a mobster prolly natta so nigga stand back
And watcha killa knockin chopper straight into the cop car standin by allah with the nation of islam
Mix alot with are guns keep a hunid in the drum niggas stranded in the slums

It ain't never been easy
For me it jus been crazy
Look wat the world gave me
But it will never break me
Da underworld outside ya home
That's where I came up on my own
This wat I'm dealin with all the time
This where a nigga fell in love with crime
That's place ain't never been easy
For me it jus been crazy

All I'm doin is getting rich ride thru mob figaz cause my momma still smoke & knock cigarettes nigga
My niggaz blind as a bat & I'm livin it with cha the crime was bigger than our city
I committed it with cha mu-ham-a-dallah man the angels come kiss us glow jus left us
Man I swear I miss her derek jus left us man I swear I miss him nigga
Angel stuck in prison and swear I miss him used to gettin paid tinted and exported black
All he ever gave his niggaz was guns, cornerz & crack the street designed u
But assigned a trap so read between the lines erase ya crime & ya gap
So scrape the gun off the wall with the strap

It ain't never been easy
For me it jus been crazy
Look wat the world gave me
But it will never break me
Da underworld outside ya home
That's where I came up on my own
This wat I'm dealin with all the time
This where a nigga fell in love with crime
That's place ain't never been easy
For me it jus been crazy

For the last two weeks it been crazy my cuddy hus locked up I'm to the neck
It kind of mainey me but like jack say I can't let it break me so I'm solo when that SL
Y ya girl wanna date me I move dumb ass moves so these suckas wanna hate me
At the same time I'm with yo girl she want to rape me but lately I'm seein how light
It showin different signs how u handle the road cuty the choice is mines
So I'm prayin on the daily puttin in his hands cause all this crime & this war is all part his plans
R.I.P MD & free Hus all my real niggaz stand up it's all on us

It ain't never been easy
For me it jus been crazy
Look wat the world gave me
But it will never break me
Da underworld outside ya home
That's where I came up on my own
This wat I'm dealin with all the time
This where a nigga fell in love with crime
That's place ain't never been easy
For me it jus been crazy
