I know you see me right here everytime you drive by.
But truth to admit you don't ever ask why.
You know I got paper cus I'm a D-Boy.

The color of ma sneaker is the color of my face.

My rapstyle freak got one up in the chamba.

I know you see me right here everytime you drive by.
But truth to admit you don't ever ask why.
You know I got paper cus I'm a D-Boy.

Rocks on the wrist big things nice car.
You wana live life with a rich rockstar.
Everybody know us, everybody know ya'll.
I think I'm a a rush so I probly never call.
