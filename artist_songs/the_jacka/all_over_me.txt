Everywhere I go girl girlies scream my name

On the dance floor with a hoe and she stupid thick

Yank em to the party all you see is paint drippin

Got so many one me but I'm focused on a thick one
Bout to go get her, rock star life forever
In the club stuie, big bottle of louie
Tryna dip with a model, out here fuckin with it truly
Got the place poppin, now that I walked in

Give it to me, then pursue me, cause they all like him

Baby do this shit, slap it in reverse
Wind them hips, I know you feel that dick

Comin out your speakers, you get weaker as you hear this shit
Let me be your teacher, I'll reach you, I'll show you this
