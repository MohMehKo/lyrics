I get up in the morning with a cock-a-doodle-do,
I get myself together if and when I chose.
I'm just buckin time, without a reason or ryme,
Oh what a wonderful way, 
to spend a carefree country day
I got to have it that way.

I best get all my chores done, got some friends a commin' by.
There's a lot of country livin in just trying to get by,
I'm just buckin time, without a reason or ryme,
Oh what a wonderful way, 
to spend a carefree country day
I got to have it that way.

I make myself a livin' off a haulin' on junk,
A man can live on thrivin from searchin' the dump.
I'm just buckin time, without a reason or ryme,
Oh what a wonderful way, 
to spend a carefree country day
I've got to have it that way.
