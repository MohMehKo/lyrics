Well I heard the story once before
And I know what the tears are for
That's a lie and I just can buy
You came for me so don't try 

And I see another man in your eyes
Yes, and you're old enough to know you can't live lies
Yes, and so I'm telling you just exactly what to do
'Cause you can't have two tastes of advice
Pay the price

And if on another time or place
Another day, another face
I'm telling you babe it's all you know
That one of us should have to go

Listen I know you hate to see me cry
But I have to go and I tell you why
Without your love I can't go on
It's easy and itâ€™s wrong
