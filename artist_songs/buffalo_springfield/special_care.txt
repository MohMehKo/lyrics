Ou' there in the window,
Lookin' at me, do you think I'm,
Blowing' my cool, playin' the fool?

You there on the corner,
Starin' at me, do you think I'm,
Trouble? Would you like to shoot me down?

And it's time for all that Special Care to be taken,
To make you aware of the forsaken,
If you don't care then we'll come and burn your house down.

Come on over sometime and talk about how all men are created equal,
Only some they mo' equal than others.
