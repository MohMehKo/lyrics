Like the ghost of someone near
She comes to haunt me in my sleep
Still unable to sincerely 
Get her heart away for keeps

Pretty Girl why?
Pretty girl why not love me?
Pretty girl why?
Pretty girl why?

There she leaves me twice as lonely 
As I was but yesterday
Keeping such a hold upon my thoughts
So near yet far away

Pretty Girl why?
Pretty girl why not love me?
Pretty girl why?
Pretty girl why?

The minstrel boy has gone to war now
Burdened with his father's sword
Still she doesn't see how she can
Give him peace amidst the horror

Pretty Girl why?
Pretty girl why not love me?
Pretty girl why?
Pretty girl why?
