Nobody knows, nobody sees
That what you can do
We know it please
But in most of the time
Not me

Yeah hear, quiet please, please

Go away, to stay
Get out of my life
You've been my wife
I've been a Jew
To be

Yeah hear, quiet please, please

You will be sorry
When you'll wake up to morrow
And you leave a lover
Won't leave a love
You won't accept the fact
That I'm not ready for the days above 
Forever long

By the look, on your face
Is that you're make it
To another place
I see you around
My sweet

Won't you please hear, quiet please, please
