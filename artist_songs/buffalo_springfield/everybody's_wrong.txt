Listen to my song
It isn't very long
You'll see before I'm gone
That everybody's wrong

Those of us who run
To catch a moment in the sun
Seem to find the when we're done
That we weren't supposed to run

And there's to many words going down
Babe wrecking against the walls with the hollow sounds
All about what it's going to be
Yes, you know what it was you see
It ain't million, you and me not a crown

Finding what you sought
After all the time you fought
Sometimes leave's you with the thought
That perhaps you just been caught
