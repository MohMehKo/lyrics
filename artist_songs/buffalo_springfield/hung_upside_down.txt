Look what's happening to me,
I'm going blind, please help.
There I sat until three,
gettin' further behind myself.
Bymyself.

And I'm hung upside down. [x2]
Hung upside down, said I'm
hung upside down, c'mon, c'mon.
Hung upside down.

Someday I will be free,
and there'll be times, you just wait.
I will come to you, see,
what I'll bring you when I get straight,
Oh it's too late.

And I'm hung upside down. [x2]
Hung upside down, said I'm
hung upside down, c'mon, c'mon.
Hung upside down.
