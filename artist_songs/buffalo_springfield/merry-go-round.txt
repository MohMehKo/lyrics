Upside down on a merry-go-round
Now just look at me
Spreading your eyes to see you standing for me
It's a lover you see

Not just to anyone
Not just to fee
Someone you can come maple leave

What in the world did you do
To make me love just you?
What did you do to me?
What you did to me

This time next time
Which ever let be
There's something I can't deny
I'm telling you now
Your love is something to me
It's like a sweet lullaby
A melody that could only imply
Loving you seems to me worth a try

What in the world did you do
To make me love just you?
What did you do to me?
What you did to me
What did you do to me?
