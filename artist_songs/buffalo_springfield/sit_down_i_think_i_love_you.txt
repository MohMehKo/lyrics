Sit down I think I love you
Anyway I'd like to try
I can't stop thinking of you
If you go I'll know I cry

Can't you see that I'm a desperate man
I can hide, just being around
You want to know
What they say about the bird in my hand
And that's why I ain't leaving without you

So if you want someone to love you
Pretty babe I'm your guy
It's not much I'm asking of you
Just please give me a try
