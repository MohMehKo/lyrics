It's great to be alive
Expect the world
You know to avoid
And who to stand up for

I don't know what to do
You're moving fast
A mind of your own
Until you fall flat
The people you adore
Will go for that

My God
It's murder
I don't know how you stand it
I get down, down, down

Games on TV
And girls in swimwear
There's so much to see
And to believe in
I could watch all night
I feel wanted

My God
It's murder
I don't know how you stand it
I can't
But God damm
It's all so sad
I don't know how you stand it
Your might get

Down, down, down

Don't know how
Don't know how

Don't know how
I don't get you
Still I don't get you
You might get

Down, down, down

It's great to be alive
Expect the world
