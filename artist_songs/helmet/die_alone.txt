Seeing is believing
Now you got that look in your eye
Baby, take a deep breath

D-Die alone
Honey, you don't need them
Now you got it

Last to first
People they're the worst
Anything it takes
Catching all the breaks

D-die alone
Honey, you don't need them
You're bored to death
And you start believing
Believing, believing

D-Die alone
Judging everybody
Did you clear your name
Did you take their money
Their money
D-die alone
Honey, now you need them
Die alone
And you start believing
Believing, believing
