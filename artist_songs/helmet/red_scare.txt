Replaced, removed, retired
It's time to clean up
Wiped out by friendly fire
A minor hiccup
Don't ask, don't tell, don't see
The sun is shining
Don't let it bother me
It's just bad timing

Red sand, red sea, red scare
All you need is fear

Now all this air I breathe is 
Contaminated
We want, we take, we need
Don't keep us waiting
Tell them it's only words
We are united
That godless scum deserves
What we decided

Red sand, red sea, red scare
Are you so afraid?
Red sand, red sea, red scare
Now you waste away

Red sand, red sea, red scare
Are you so afraid?
Red sand, red sea, red scare
Now you waste away
