Nobody knows you've
Been holding up the sky
Earth, moon and tide
Move the way you move
Darling look alive

Hey look alive
You're spotless on the outside
Darling I won't be surprised
You get what you need

Nobody sees you
You start noticing
It's where it begins
Face, mouth and throat
In every headline
There's an opening
For murderers

Hey look alive
You're spotless on the outside
Darling I won't be surprised
You get what you need

Hey look alive
Hey look alive
Hey look alive
Hey look alive
