[Verse: Big Boi]
Five o'clock, but I stopped at 4:59
Twist a date and some haze, got a car from Sleepy Brown Brown
See it's going down downtown at the lounge
It's definately crowded with that happy our crowd
Drinks for a dollar, everybody buzzin couzin
Spitting like a major league pitcher trying to cut something
Only throwing balls, no strikes for tonight
So walk into the Chevy for some heavy petting let's ride!
To my underground bungalow, approach the mound
Baby I'm the "head" coach now, wow! baby need a cold wet towel
Pharrell's on the way so stay and play a while
Yeah.. uh, Sleepy Brown, Pharrell, Big Boi

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I been working all day, now I'm done so see ya!
It's time for play, name the place I'll meet ya!
We can do the bar, sip Margaritas
Stay on the floor, go when we feel right
Aren't you feeling nice? Doesn't it feel nice?! Is everybody HIIIGH?!

[Verse: Sleepy Brown]
Go on baby, do your thing now
Sitting at the bar, where were you hanging?
I wonder if, you know I want you
Cause everything you do is so good too
Like the way you run your fingers (over that glass)
Ooh the way you look over (your shoulders when you dance)
I'm trying to get the nerve, to talk to you
So maybe we can, find something to do

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I been working all day, now I'm done so see ya!
It's time for play, name the place I'll meet ya!
We can do the bar, sip Margaritas
Stay on the floor, go when we feel right
Aren't you feeling nice? Doesn't it feel nice?! Is everybody HIIIGH?!

[Verse: Sleepy Brown]
Don't worry baby, I'm here my lady
Starin at your eyes, trying to read your mind
Don't you realize? I'm right for you
That type for you, one - that - makes
All your dreams reality baby (we'll go as planned)
Then we'll turn this thing into a (serious romance)
I'm - here for you my babe, what do you need?
You're every wish, ooh girl I would need

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I been working all day, now I'm done so see ya!
It's time for play, name the place I'll meet ya!
We can do the bar, sip Margaritas
Stay on the floor, go when we feel right
Aren't you feeling nice? Doesn't it feel nice?! Is everybody HIIIGH?!
