Well ever since the first time i saw you, 
never been so intreeged that my thoughts are filled with you, 
breakin' my neck to get cute and go out with my friends to all the parties hopin' 
maybe i'm gonna see you, don't wanna do anything to loose this opportunity, 
gotta be a gift from GOD he sent down just for me, 
got lost but now i'm back cuz all i wanna do is just be where you at.

[Chorus:] 
mmmmm you, what you gonna try to make me proove suga, 
mmmmmm you, wanna have your children 3 or 4 of for you, mmmmmm you.

So ghetto but fly, classy your manhood is all that, 
make me feel all shy & shit around you, 
but whatever i need daddy you take care of that (knoow how to take care of that) 
just tell me what i need to do to be your number one, 
everything you need everyday after your work is done, 
don't even wanna date i'm already twisted up, not tryna do nothin' to ever fuck this up.

[Chorus:] 
mmmmmm you, mmmmmm you, mmmmmm you, (whatcha gonna do to try to make me prove it) 
mmmmmm you (wanna have your children 2 3 or 4 for you)

Your love puts me on a thrown, i could touch the sky babe, 
& i'm drifting on a cloud cuz i'm satisfied,
Your love is like a fix and i need to stay high, yeah, 
one dose of your affection & i'll never come down 
(ya don't gotta worry cuz you got me boy) you, you, you
Your love put s me on a thrown, 
i could touch the sky & i'm drifting on a cloud cuz i'm satisfied 
(your loves got me goin' babe)

one dose of your affection & i'll never come down 
(truth surely wanna be ya lady)

[Chorus:] 
mmmmmm you mmmmmm you.
