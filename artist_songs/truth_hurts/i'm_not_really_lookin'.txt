Oh

Tonight I want to get started
Do what I came to do
I see you checkin'
But see, I'm not really checkin' for you, no

I want to sit back
Join baby, have a drink or two
(That's what I've come to do)
So don't come spit ‚ö‚Rcause that's not what I'm about
Not tonight, I'm cool, yeah, yeah

No, I'm not really lookin' (Mmm)
Just came to have a good time (I'm not)
Don't wanna get too serious (No, hey)
That's not what's on my mind (Not what's on my mind)

No, I'm not really lookin' (Hey)
That's not what's on my plan (Not my plan)
Don't wanna be with you tonight (Hey)
Not lookin' for no man (No man, no man, no man)

Another day in the nightlife
In a club, tryin' to get away from my wife
With my ladies, introduce them to a mad world
And I saw you side step ‚ö‚Rem, you's a bad girl
Look at you sittin' on a stool at the bar, you's a young star
With your own crib, own chips, and own car
But you're starin' at my nephew R
Like you're makin' me jealous, but you ain't knowin' me
Fellas, what you gonna tell us
You must be thinkin' that my mack ain't tired
I'm pimpin', you're turnin' your back, baby, you ain't right
You better ask this bartender
That be holdin' a platinum American Express Corporate
with stars in them
With that Cris' in your clutch
Fooled by the bull, by the bull too much
How come we can't get into some bubble s***
Some of that old get naked, get in trouble s*** (Mmm,mmm)

Oh, no, I'm not really lookin' (‚ö‚RCause I'm not)
Just came to have a good time (No, no)
Don't wanna get too serious (No)
That's not what's on my mind (That's not what's on my mind)

Yes, I'm not really lookin'
That's not what's on my plan (No)
Don't wanna be with you tonight
Not lookin' for no man

Come this party and I'm not tryin' to stop
Ho, beggars don't be wylin', make 'em shut down the spot, oh, no
So baby, just cool out, that's not what this is about
Come feel me on this flow, I'm not just sayin' no

No, I'm not really lookin' (No)
Just came to have a good time (Good time)
Don't wanna get too serious (Hey, oh)
That's not what's on my mind (On my mind, yeah)

No, I'm not really lookin'
That's not what's on my plan (Not my plan)
Don't wanna be with you tonight
Not lookin' for no man (No man)

No, I'm not really lookin' (I'm not)
Just came to have a good time
Don't wanna get too serious (‚ö‚RCause it's a party)
That's not what's on my mind

No, I'm not really lookin' (I)
That's not what's on my plan (I)
Don't wanna be with you tonight
Not lookin' for no man

(No man)
No, no man
No, no

F***, where's my drink?
