[chorus:]
i think i'm ready now, think i'm ready ready for love
i know what to do 
i think i'm ready now, think i'm ready ready for love
you know what to do 
i think i'm ready now, think i'm ready ready for love
i know what to do 
i think i'm ready now, think i'm ready ready for love
you know what to do 

i been holdin on so damn long, but now i'm quittin the game
see i was thinkin that i could be wifey if i made you wait
unless you know every woman has piece and mine are overdue
im open if you wanna get all up inside of truth

[chorus]

you make me so high in expericence with you
cant believe that you teachin me things that i thought i already knew
don't think i ever wanted somethin so bad i'm willin to just blow the time
oh, wanted to call someone my own like this, tell them other niggas in line

[chorus]

throw me on the counter (by the kitchen door)
lets do acrobatics (make my body soar)
make the neighbors jealous (and ill make you scream)
my legs around your pelvis (ain't got no other things)

(chorus)

oooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
by the candlelight
oooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
you know what i like
