Let me tell you a story
Of a little boy who had lost his way
In search for something to make it a better day

But all he seemed to find
Was a world of hurt and pain
And a place that didn't seem to care
That he'd lost his way

So the boy began to cry
Yes, the boy began to cry

Does anyone love me?
Does anyone care?
Is anyone out there
That finds me lovely?
That finds me lovely
That finds me lovely

Just when the little boy had lost all hope
Well, along came a man that ushered him in
He held him to his chest
And He said "Little boy, it's time that you rest"

He opened up His arms
And said, "I've been searching for you for sometime
Now, little boy, you have found a home
And now longer shall you roam"

Then the man began to cry
Yes, the man began to cry

Don't you know I love you?
Don't you know I care?
And I will always be here
And I find you lovely

Yes, I find you lovely
Yes, I find you so, so lovely
I find you lovely
Yes, I find you lovely

Find you lovely
Yes, I find you lovely
Yes, I find you lovely
I find you so lovely

Yes, I find you so lovely
Find you lovely
