Face down lying there on the pavement 
Your head’s spinning and you wonder where your faith went
Your heart’s heavy and you don’t what to say
I know it’s hard ‘cause you’re trying to believe it
So close your eyes and maybe you can see it
There’s a blue sky just beyond the gray

You were born to fly
Like a firefly, like a firefly
Lightin’ up the sky, lightin’ up the sky
You were made to soar
You were made for more, you were made for more
You were born to fly, you were born to fly

I know the tears are weighing you down
It’s hard to breathe, but you just gotta let it out
Don’t fear love is here when you cry

Right now in your moment of weakness
Right now as you’re falling into pieces
Right not you only gotta realize

When your heart breaks
You’ve had all you can take
Hold on, hold on
The darkest moment comes
Just before the dawn
Hold on, hold on
