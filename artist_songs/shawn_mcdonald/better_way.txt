Everybody wants, not everybody needs
Everybody hurts, not everybody bleeds
Everybody has words, sometimes is just talk
Everybody tries, not everybody walks
You got to redefine your mind

[Chorus]
I believe there's a better way
Something's out of place
I believe there's a better way
Something's got to change

So many things that are running around in you
So many things pulling and tugging you from what is true
Fight, give, stand, and live for love
You got to redefine your mind

[Chorus]
I believe there's a better way
Somethings out of place
I believe there's a better way
Somethings got to change

Man, these things they just ain't fitting
Like pretty politicians, hoping he can fix what's missing
By taking out the competition
They like to yell and such
I like the softer touch
All they do is talk so much when all we need is change
Not monetarily, the end of the world is approaching scarily
Well, not to be personally
But to a friend, I mind this terribly
Caught off guard, when he realized that our love is hard
Then he realized that day to day, he could find a better way

Sing it
There's got to be a better way you see
How bout the way it's supposed to be
A better way you see
How bout the way it's supposed to be
Everybody now
