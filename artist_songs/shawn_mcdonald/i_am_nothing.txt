I am nothing without You
Only a fly upon the wall
Listening in, hoping to find something about You
That will keep me from this fall

And sometimes I catch a glimpse
And my heart begins to beat
Day by day awaken me
You put the wind beneath my feet

I don't follow water
That brings life to me
'Cause I don't follow truth, oh
That sets man free

I am nothing without You
Only the dirt beneath Your nails
My heart is bruised and it's broken
And my soul is very frail

Please give me a reason
I need to name this man
And no longer this broken treason
Only on You I will stand

I don't follow water
That brings life to me
'Cause I don't follow truth, oh
That sets man free

I don't follow water
That brings life to me
'Cause I don't follow truth, oh
That sets man free

Please mend these broken wings
And take the scales from my eyes
Without You I am nothing
I will not survive

And please mend these broken wings
And take the scales from my eyes
Without You I am nothing
I will not survive

I don't follow water
That brings life to me
'Cause I don't follow truth, oh
Sets man free

'Cause I don't follow water
That brings life to me
'Cause I don't follow truth
That sets man free
