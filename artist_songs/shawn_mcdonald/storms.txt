I feel like I'm caught in the middle of a hurricane
Standing in the eye of the storm
The water's deepening and the waves are crashing in
And I, I'm losing, I'm losing my way home

[Chorus]
But I will not fear
When the storms of life appear
Cause You're holding me holding me tight
Your keeping me alive
When the storms of life arise
And You're helping me helping me to fight through the night

When life is not what I thought that it would be
The pain is sometimes more than I can stand
And I have had to learn a lot the hard way
But I'm trusting that my life is in Your hands

[Chorus]
But I will not fear
When the storms of life appear
Cause You're holding me holding me tight
Your keeping me alive
When the storms of life arise
And You're helping me helping me to fight through the night

And You're holding me holding me
And You're finding me finding me
And You're guiding me guiding me
Through the night

[Chorus]
I will not fear
When the storms of life appear
Cause You're holding me holding me tight
Your keeping me alive
When the storms of life arise
And You're helping me helping me to fight through the night
