Welcome to the search for meaning
If you’re alive, then you’re feeling 
what it is to be happy, lonely, broken
To be human

We’re all the same when it all comes down to it
All looking for hope when we’re going through it
At the end of the day it’s not far away

Hope is anywhere, any place we are
There’s nothing you need to fear
Because His love is reminding us
Hope is right here, hope is right here
Hope is here

You are not alone in the moments
When you’re afraid
He holds them in His hands
So you can rest in the promise

This world may not be home
But that don’t mean we’re on our own
Because His love is reminding us
Hope is right here, hope is right here

This world may not be home
But that don’t mean we’re on our own
Because His love is alive in us
Hope is right here, hope is right here
