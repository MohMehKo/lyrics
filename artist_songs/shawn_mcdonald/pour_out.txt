Pour out Your water
That I might take a sip
Your love consumes me
Every drip

It is like honey
On my lips
So pour out Your water
That I might take a sip

Your words are a lamp unto my feet
When I walk down these
Dark and lonely streets
You are all I need

Pour out Your mercy
And clear this busy mind
Your love is like eden
A slice of apple pie

It is like sugar on my tongue
So pour out Your mercy
Clear my busy mind

Your words are a lamp unto my feet
When I walk down these
Dark and lonely streets
You are all I need

Your words are a lamp unto my feet
When I walk down these
Dark and lonely streets

You are all, You are all
You are all, You are all
You are all, You are all
You are all I need
