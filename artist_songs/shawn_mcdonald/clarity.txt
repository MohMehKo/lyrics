Well, I'm just a simple man with a simple plan
Trying to find my way home
And this dusted way with nothing left to say
I stagger and I roam

And I'm tired and I'm worn and my clothes are kinda torn
From this long hard road
My arms and legs are weak, I continue to seek
And leave behind this load

I need clarity and truth to be
And peace to make me whole
I want freedom to come and hate to be done
And love to guide my soul

I want love, yeah, I want love

Standing on the battle line
I fight for my mind aching to be free
This war that I face as I long to embrace
And be with my King

And this fire in my soul, desire to be whole
Is deep within my bones
And I long to be near as I cast away my fear
Running for Your throne

I need clarity and truth to be
And peace to make me whole
I want freedom to come and hate to be done
And love to guide my soul

Yeah, I want love, I want love
I want love, I want love
Yeah, I want
I want

I want clarity and truth to be
And peace to make me whole
I want freedom to come and hate to be done
And love to guide my soul

Yeah, I want love, yeah, I want love
Yeah, I want love, yeah, I want love
Yeah, I want love, yeah, I want love
Yeah, I want love, yeah, I want love
I want

I don't know
I don't know
