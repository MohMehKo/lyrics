Sometimes it is hard to go on
It's hard to see the reasons
For breathing, living, letting love guide the way
But you must hold on

[Chorus]
Don't give up
Don't give up
Hold on for one more day

Sometimes we fall down
We get ourselves in trouble
But it's OK
Cause we still have another chance to get it right
To get it right

[Chorus]
Don't give up
Don't give up
Hold on for one more day

I've come too far
I've seen so much
I've heard the call and felt the touch
I've tasted love that I cannot deny

[Chorus]
Don't give up
Don't give up
Hold on for one more day
