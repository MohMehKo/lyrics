I've heard it said that a wise man
Does not live on bread alone
But off the everlasting words
Dripping from the Almighty's tongue

And I've heard it said that a wise man
Does not look at himself in the mirror
Then turn away and walk
Forgetting what he looks like standing there

Oh, men like these
They are just like trees
Planted near streams of water
With roots that grow
Deep, deep into the ground

I've heard it said that a wise man
Ignores the call from the corner
Even with her seductive eyes
He turns away, he doesn't listen to her lies

And oh, men like these
They are just like trees
Planted near streams of water
With roots that grow
Deep, deep into the ground

Into the ground
Into the ground
Into the ground

Into the ground
Into the ground
Into the ground

And oh, men like these
They are just like trees
Planted near streams of water
With roots that grow
Deep, deep into the ground

Into the ground
Into the ground
Into the ground

Into the ground
Into the ground
Into the ground
