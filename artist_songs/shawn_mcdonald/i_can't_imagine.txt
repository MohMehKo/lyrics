Sometimes I don't like who am
But you push a little harder, and you see a little farther
From where I stand
Tell me again what you see in me
‘Cause I know I'm not alone, but it’s hard to breathe

Won't you take my hand, letting fear go
Let's let love take control
Fight for our heart this is the start
I can't imagine my life apart
From you, from you, from you

I know we are not there yet
But we'll dream a little deeper, for this love is more tender
From where we stand
Let me love you in the here and now
And the mystery of tomorrow will soon be found

I don't know the answers of tomorrow
Let's fly away and we'll shine through the sorrow
And grow like a flower in the sweet surrender of the morning sun
Throw away the keys I don't need another option
Look to the heavens and we’ll fall into the ocean
Blow up the bridges behind us and we won’t ever turn around
