Some might say that I’m a dreamer
‘Cause I believe love can change the world
I sit in the middle of what seems hopeless
I wanna live to be the hope
I wanna live, I wanna live

To be the man I’m meant to be
You’ve got the best of me
All I’ve got is today and tonight
I don’t know what tomorrow may bring
Jumpin’ in with all my heart
I won’t wait another day to start
Trying to see a smiling face
At the end of the day
At the end of the day

I want my heart to beat with passion
I want my motive to be pure
I want the legacy that I leave
To affect the life You gave me
In everything I do, I wanna choose

To be the man I’m meant to be
You’ve got the best of me
All I’ve got is today and tonight
I don’t know what tomorrow may bring
Jumpin’ in with all my heart
I won’t wait another day to start
Trying to see a smiling face
At the end of the day
At the end of the day
At the end of the day
At the end of the day

Never stop fighting, never stop dreaming
Never stop giving, never stop speaking
Heart set on what matters
Love keeps us together
Never stop fighting, never stop dreaming
Never stop giving, never stop speaking
Heart set on what matters
Love keeps us together

To be the man I’m meant to be
You’ve got the best of me
All I got is today and tonight, so I’m
Jumpin’ in with all my heart
I won’t wait another day to start
Trying to see a smiling face

Never stop fighting, never stop dreaming
Never stop giving, never stop speaking
Heart set on what matters
Love keeps us together
Never stop fighting, never stop dreaming
Never stop giving, never stop speaking
Heart set on what matters
Love keeps us together
