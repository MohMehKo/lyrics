My heart is losing control over You
My heart is losing control over You

Lost in everlasting Love's amorous glow
Set aflame despite the rain and seven seasons of snow
I got accustomed to white knuckles from all the time I spent alone
When I gave away my heart I was neglected and disowned
And then You came to me and took the time to speak in poems
And whispered that You'd like for me to make with You a home
And now from the ashes, like a Phoenix, this new love has flown
Despite the greatest hearts
I'm afraid to lose control

[Chorus]
My heart is losing control over You
My heart is losing control over You
My heart is losing control over You
My heart is losing control over You

I sing Selah my love, and Hallelujah, let go
Of the plans and demands that will maintain control
Of your heart and your head and your spirit and soul
I'm a lovesick man and my love makes me bold
And I'll crawl through the wire, through the fire and the cold
And I'll whisper Your Name down every desolate road
Until I find You again and I make sure you know
That my love will never die, I love you

[Chorus]
My heart is losing control over You
My heart is losing control over You
My heart is losing control over You
My heart is losing control over You

Every time You get close to me, I feel my heart skip a beat [x2]
Every time I get close to You, I feel my heart skip a beat [x2]
