Slow down, baby, slow down
Slow down, darling, slow down

There ain't no reason
You got to be moving around like that
There ain't no reason
You got to be moving so, so fast
Slow down, slow down

Sitting here in this living room
Waiting for you to come home soon to me, to me
Thinking about the times that
We used to rap and rhyme about life

Slow down, baby, slow down
Slow down, darling, slow down

There ain't no reason
You got to be moving around like that
There ain't no reason
You got to be moving so, so fast

Slow down, slow down
Slow down, slow down

Slow down, baby, slow down
And slow down, darling, slow down

There ain't no reason
You got to be moving
There ain't no reason
You got to be moving

Slow down, baby, slow down
