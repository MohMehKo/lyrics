The ways of this world are grabbing a hold
Won't let me go, won't let me fly by
It taken it's toll down on my soul
'Cause I know what I need in my life
Don't let me lose my sight of You
Don't let me lose my sight

[Chorus:]
I don't want to fall away from You
Gravity is pulling me on down
I don't want to fall away from You
Gravity is pulling me to the ground

This world keeps making me cry
But I'm going to try, going to try to fly, going to fly high
Don't want to give into the sin, want to stay in You 'til the end
Don't want to lose my sight of You
Don't want to lose my sight

[Chorus]

I want to fly
Into the sky
Turn my back on this old world
Leave it all behind
This place is not my home
It's got nothing for me
Only leaves me with emptiness
And tears in my eyes

[Chorus 2x]
