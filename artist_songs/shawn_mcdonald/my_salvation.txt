I run for dear life to You my God
And I never live to regret it
Do what you do so well and do what you do so well
Get me out of this mess

Upon to my feet

You, my salvation
You, my fortress
And You, my salvation
With whom I trust

Put Your ear to the ground and listen
Give me space for this salvation
And be a guest room where I can retreat
You said, Your door was always open

It's always open

You, my salvation
You, my fortress
'Cause You, my salvation
With whom I trust

You, my salvation
You, my fortress
'Cause You, my salvation

My God, free me
From the grip of the wicked
From the clutch of the bad and the boogie
Oh, my God, free me, free me

'Cause You, my salvation
'Cause You, my fortress
'Cause You, my salvation
With whom I trust

'Cause You, my salvation
'Cause You, my fortress
'Cause You, my salvation
With whom I trust

'Cause You, my salvation
'Cause You, my fortress
'Cause You, my salvation
With whom I trust
