Blessed are the poor
For theirs is the kingdom
Blessed are those who mourn
For they will be comforted

Blessed are the meek
For they will inherit the earth
And blessed are those who hunger and thirst
For they will be filled

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Blessed are the merciful
For they will be shown mercy
Blessed are the pure in heart
For they will see God Almighty

And blessed are the peacemakers
For they will be called His children
And blessed are the persecuted
For they will inherit the Kingdom of Heaven

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Rejoice and be glad
For great is your reward
Rejoice and be glad
For great is your reward

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
