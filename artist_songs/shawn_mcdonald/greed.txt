Well, take a look around and tell me what you see
We are consuming everything
And I must confess that I fall
Oh, isn't this the story of us all?

Falsely advertised
Into believing that we need this stuff in our lives

'Cause what we got is what we need
And everything else is only greed
It's greener on the other side
Oh, why can't we be satisfied

Oh whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

And I've seen some with a little
And they seemed like they were doing just fine to me
And I've seen some with a lot
And they don't seem like they ever want to stop

Falsely advertised
Into believing that we need this stuff in our lives

'Cause what we got is what we need
And everything else is only greed
It's greener on the other side
Oh, why can't we be satisfied

Oh whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

'Cause what we got is what we need
And everything else is only greed
It's greener on the other side
Oh, why can't we be satisfied

Oh whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
