Awaken me from my sleep
And open up my weary eyes
Move me from my complacency
And bring my soul back to life

Won't You take this heart and mind
And help me to believe?

In the fire that ignites my bones
It's in the water that brings life to my soul
It's in the blood that washes me clean

Consume my wandering thoughts
And renew my mind
And remake and recreate
And interrupt my life

Won't You breathe Your breath on me
And help me to believe?

In the fire that ignites my bones
It's in the water that brings life to my soul
It's in the blood that washes me clean

Won't You help me to believe?
Won't You help me to believe?

In the fire that ignites my bones
It's in the water that brings life to my soul
It's in the blood that washes me clean

It's in the fire that ignites my bones
It's in the water that brings life to my soul
It's in the blood that washes me clean

It washes me, washes me
It washes me clean
