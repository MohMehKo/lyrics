You are a lighthouse when I'm lost at sea
You are the language that I'm trying to speak
You are the taste that keeps me thirsting
You are the courage running through my veins
You are the compass pointing to a better way
And You are the whisper beckoning me

[Chorus]
Hope is rising
Hope is on the move
In the air and on the ground
In my head and all around
Hope is rising

You are infectious, You're spreading through me
And You are the melody that I want to sing
You are the tempo beating within my chest

[Chorus]
Hope is rising
Hope is on the move
In the air and on the ground
In my head and all around
Hope is rising

[Bridge]
It is rising, it is rising, it is rising up [x2]
Hope is on the move

[Chorus]
Hope is rising
Hope is on the move
In the air and on the ground
In my head and all around
Hope is rising
