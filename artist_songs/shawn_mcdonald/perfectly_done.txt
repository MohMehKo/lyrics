Hey, little sister
Why do you cry?
Holdin' your head so low
May I ask you why?

And don't you know that He loves you?
And don't you know that He cares?
And He will never leave you, no
And never leave you there

'Cause you are perfect
You are perfectly, perfectly done

And hey, little brother
I know life has been rough
But I believe in you
'Cause in God, you are tough

You must stand tall
And leave it all
Never let this whole world
Take away your soul

'Cause you are perfect
You are perfectly, perfectly done
You are perfect, yes, you are perfectly done
