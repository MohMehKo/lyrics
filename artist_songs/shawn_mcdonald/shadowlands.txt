The Lord thy God is my Shepherd
And in Him I shall not want
He leads me beside still water
And He restores my soul

And even though I walk through the valley of the shadows
I will fear no evil
And even though my enemy is camped upon my chest
I will fear no evil

The Lord thy God is my Shepherd
And in Him I shall not want
He leads me into green fields
Lays my head down to rest

And even though I walk through the valley of the shadows
I will fear no evil
And even though my enemy is camped upon my chest
I will fear no evil
I will fear no evil

And even though I walk through the valley of the shadows
I will fear no evil
And even though my enemy is camped upon my chest
I will fear no evil

I will fear no evil
I will fear no evil
I will fear no, fear no, fear no
Fear no evil
