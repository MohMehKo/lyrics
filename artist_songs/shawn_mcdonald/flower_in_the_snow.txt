Tell me what you dream
When you fall asleep
Wondering what you feel
Is hiding underneath
Watching your feet on shaky sand
And I just want to help you understand

Heaven’s going to shine through
And your world is on fire
Love is going to cover you
And carry you away, carry you away

Heaven’s going to shine through
And the sun will grow brighter
If you’re lost I am going to find you
‘Cause apart of you is a part of Me
Yeah, a part of you is a part of Me

A flower in the snow
A ship out on the sea
Contradicting words
That’s not how it’s supposed to be
Caught in a battle that’s not your own
And nothing matters now unless you know

Even when you’re broken
Your name is still engraved upon my heart
You are not forgotten
I know you, I see you where you are
And the fear you might love
Will never let you go
