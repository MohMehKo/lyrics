What will cause a man
To climb the highest mountain in search for more
And will cause a man
To swim the vast blue sea in search for more
What will cause a man
To soar through the clouds in search for more
Yes what is he looking for

[Chorus]
Now I'm sailing on the sea of Mystery
And I'm floating on the ocean of unknown
And I'm going to come ashore until I find what I'm looking for
I'm not coming back til I find love

What will cause a man
To wage the wildest storms in search for more
What will cause a man
To explore the darkest jungles in search for more
What will cause a man
To fly to the moon in search for more
Yes what is he looking for

[Chorus]
Now I'm sailing on the sea of Mystery
And I'm floating on the ocean of unknown
And I'm going to come ashore until I find what I'm looking for
I'm not coming back til I find love

Now I'm sailing on the open open blue
In hopes of someday finding You

[Chorus]
Now I'm sailing on the sea of Mystery
And I'm floating on the ocean of unknown
And I'm going to come ashore until I find what I'm looking for
I'm not coming back til I find love
