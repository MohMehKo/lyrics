I'm still up, and it's 3 in the morning
I try to sleep but my mind keeps going
Am I awake cause You're trying to speak to me
Lying here with my ears wide open
Can You fix what I know I have broken
There's a hole in my heart where I need You to be
But I'm right here, and You're right there
Will You take this wall I built and tear it down

[Chorus:]
And do what You always do
Making the old so new
Taking away the space between us
Filling it up with more of You
You do what You always do
Cause You're my rescue
Taking away the space between us
Taking away the space between me and You

Never really meant to be so distant
Should have known that it made no difference
You were holding my hand when I walked away
And You were there in the middle of the night
You were there when I lost my sight
And You're still here with me today

[Chorus:]
And do what You always do
Making the old so new
Taking away the space between us
Filling it up with more of You
You do what You always do
Cause You're my rescue
Taking away the space between us
Taking away the space between me and You
