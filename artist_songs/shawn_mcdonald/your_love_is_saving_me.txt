You’re the cure to the pain
You’re the heart when I am frail
You’re the life in my veins, the air that I exhale
You’re the reason that I am breathing
The reason that I have this life within my lungs
You’re the reason that I’m running
The reason that I’m running
The reason that I’m running home

Your love was my departure into the great unknown
You are my hearts contender
You are my home

Your love is saving me
Your love is the air I breathe
Your love consumes my soul
Your love is bringing me home

You’re the train on the track
You’re the parachute when I fall
You’re the wind at my back when I soar like a cannon ball
You’re the melody I’m singing, the melody I’m bringing
The backbeat of this song
You’re the reason that I’m running
The reason that I’m running
The reason that I’m running home

Your love the sweetest venture
The reason why I roam
You’re heart is my surrender
You bring me home
