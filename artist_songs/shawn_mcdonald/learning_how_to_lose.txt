Said a lot of words
Cried a lot of tears
Too many years
I've been running

Holding onto pride
Living out of fear
If I stay here
I’ll start crumbling

Nothing left to say and nothing left to prove
Hearts get rearranged but can't escape the truth
A life of letting go is always hard to choose
‘Cause learning how to love is learning how to lose

Spending all my days
Trying to get it right
Putting up a fight
It’s just not worth it

I could never fix
What I can't break
What’s it going to take
It’s just not working

And holding on to all the hurt and bitterness inside
Only leaves you lonely like a fading star at night
So open up your eyes
