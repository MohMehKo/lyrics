I feel like the weight of the world is all
Crashing down on me
And some how I just don't believe this how
It is suppose to be

And all this expectation on
The way I'm suppose to live
Becomes my minds distraction
With nothing left to give

You said your burden is light
And your load is no more
You said your ways are right
And in you I will soar

I want to be free
Free to dance and free to sing
Free to live and love and free
Oh, free to be me

I feel like my heart is being beat
Down into the ground
In you I'm longing for some peace
To be found

I know the heaviness that's
Making me cold
Is stealing my youthful soul and
Making me old

You said your burden is light
And your load is no more
You said your ways are right
And in you I will soar

I want to be free
Free to dance and free to sing
Free to live and love and free
Oh, free to be me

I want to be free, yeah
Free to dance and free to sing
Free to live and love and free
Oh, free to be me

Wanna be free
Free to dance and free to sing
Free to live and love
And free to be me

Wanna be free, yeah
Free to dance and free to sing
Free to live and love and free
Oh, free to be me
