Can I sing You a song?
About what happens when You're gone
My whole world seems to fall
And I don't feel like myself at all

I must confess that it's true
That I'm nothing without You
We're two souls turning to one
'Cause without You I feel undone

Can I sing You a song?
About what happens when You're gone
Everything around comes crashing down
I find myself on the ground

I must confess that it's true
That I'm nothing without You
We are two souls turning to one
'Cause without You I feel undone

I must confess that it's true
That I'm nothing without You
We are two souls turning to one
'Cause without You I feel undone
