Jumped in the car slammed on the gas
Got to get away from here real fast
The enemy is breathing down my neck
Trying to grab a hold and make my wreck
Hot on my tail trying to make my fail
Trying to take the wind up out of my sail
Trying to run me off this road

[Chorus]
Eyes forward
Don't look at whats behind
Eyes forward
Don't take your eyes off the prize

Well the pressure's bleeding in
Giving me some blurry vision
Fogging up my intellect
Where love and hate they intersect
Keep the path of the mission
Never going to lose my ambition
Got my eyes up on the prize

[Chorus]
Eyes forward
Don't look at whats behind
Eyes forward
Don't take your eyes off the prize
