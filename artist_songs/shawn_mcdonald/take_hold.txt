There is no hope up in your eyes
As if the blue had left your skies
Sadness fills your cheeks of stone
Maybe you believe you are alone

Your face is shone with quiet despair
As if this was what you chose to wear
Your sin you strap upon your chest
As if there was no longer rest, longer rest

Take hold, don't give up
You gotta make the best of what you got
Give it all your best shot

Take hold, don't give up
You gotta make the best of what you got
Give it all your best shot
Take hold, don't give up

Your heart seems to have hit the floor
But I do believe you're meant to soar
The enemy's wounds, they must go deep
But I pray, the Lord, your soul to keep

There is no taking back those days a gone
But now it's your chance just to move on
Make the best of the life you live
'Cause before Him you soon will give
You soon will give

Take hold, don't give up
You gotta make the best of what you got
Give it all your best shot

Take hold, don't give up
You gotta make the best of what you got
Give it all your best shot
Take hold, don't give up

Take hold, don't give up
You gotta make the best of what you got
Give it all your best shot

Take hold, don't give up
You gotta make the best of what you got
Give it all your best shot
Take hold, don't give up
