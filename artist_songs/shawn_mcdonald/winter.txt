Sometimes I feel like winter, cold I feel
Icicles are forming
It's hard to tell what is real
Cold winter, cold winter day

Frost is on the windshield and it's hard to see
Air is like slivers
It's hard to breathe
It's a cold winter, cold winter day

Warm me up inside
And let Your face from me not hide
'Cause You are what I long to find
To melt this cold heart of mine
'Cause when You are around I am found

Sometimes I feel like the prodigal, a wandering weary son
Gone in search of something beautiful
Something to make me one
It's a cold winter, cold winter day

The world is full of lies that will only rob you blind
Hit ya' when you are not looking
And steal away your time
It's a cold winter, cold winter day

And warm me up inside
Let Your face from me not hide
'Cause You are what I long to find
To melt this cold heart of mine
And when You are around I am found

Warm me up inside
And let Your face from me not hide
'Cause You are what I long to find
To melt this cold heart of mine
'Cause when You are around
'Cause when You are around
And when You are around I am found
