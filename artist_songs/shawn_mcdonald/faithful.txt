It's been so cold I can see my breath
Feeling like Winter inside my chest
Hope that I can make it through today
It's so easy to just forget
The troubles that You've brought me through and yet
I find it so hard to trust that You will stay

[Chorus]
And I need to I need to remember
Oh I need to I need to remember
You're Faithful, even when I fall down
Even when I go South You will always be
Faithful, and I need You now, oh I need You now
Every part of me
You're Faithful, You're Faithful
You're Faithful, You're Faithful

What if I choose to just let go
And let You take full control
What if I finally trust that Your love remains

[Chorus]
And I need to I need to remember
Oh I need to I need to remember
You're Faithful, even when I fall down
Even when I go South You will always be
Faithful, and I need You now, oh I need You now
Every part of me
You're Faithful, You're Faithful
You're Faithful, You're Faithful

Sometimes I feel like I'm way over my head
And I lose You
But I'm gonna do whatever it takes to stay

Faithful, You're Faithful
You're Faithful, even when I fall down
Even when I go South You will always be
Faithful, and I need You now, oh I need You now
Every part of me
You're Faithful, You're Faithful
You're Faithful, You're Faithful
