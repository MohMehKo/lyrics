Sometimes I wanna jump from
This tree that I've climbed up in
And trust that You will catch me
And keep me safe from harm

Oh, I want to let go
And trust that You are in control

Won't You take me and make me
Beautiful, beautiful?
Won't You take me and make me
Beautiful, beautiful?

Sometimes I feel like I am
Stuck in a hot air balloon
Floating through the open
And longing to be down with You

Oh, I want to let go
And trust that You are in control

Won't You take me and make me
Beautiful, beautiful?
Won't You take me and make me
Beautiful, beautiful?

Won't You take me and make me
Beautiful, beautiful?
Won't You take me and make me
Beautiful, beautiful?
