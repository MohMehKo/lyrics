I just want something real
So tired of hiding how I feel
I can't take another step
Cause I'm already out of breath

And the weight of it all is pulling me under
And the weight of it all is making me wonder

[Chorus]
How can we know so much
Yet still be so out of touch
And how we miss the point
When its all about, all about love

Can You show me something new
Can You show me what is true
I need more than just religion
Cause I'm religiously unmoved

And the weight of it all is pulling me under
And the weight of it all is making me wonder

[Chorus]
How can we know so much
Yet still be so out of touch
And how we miss the point
When its all about, all about love

Does anybody feel this
Does anybody feel this way
Does anybody feel like they don't belong
Does anybody see this
Does anybody see this way
Does anybody see this way is wrong
I just want something real

And the weight of it all is pulling me under
And the weight of it all is making me wonder

[Chorus]
How can we know so much
Yet still be so out of touch
And how we miss the point
When its all about, all about love
