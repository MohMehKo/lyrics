Just the other day went walking
Down to the corner and I saw a man
Sitting with a cup in his hand
Saying, "Hey won't you give me something
Won't you give me something to eat?"

I took a look into his eyes and
I saw he had a story to tell
But I walked away with my pockets full
Full of change
And I said, "I got nothing for you"

It's time to confess
That I need a little more
Jesus inside of me
Jesus inside of me

Don't you see, Jesus was homeless
Walking from city to city
Teaching people how to love
Giving them grace and mercy
Giving them grace and mercy

Now, Jesus was a friend to the friendless
Loving on all the outcasts
Teaching them that there was more
More than what they're living for
More than what they're living for

It's time to confess
That I need a little more
Jesus inside of me
Jesus inside of me

Don't you see, if you do not learn love
Then you will be completely nothing
You could be absolutely amazing
But you would be nothing

It's time to confess
That I need a little more, little more
It's time to confess
That I need a little more, little more

Jesus inside of me
Jesus inside of me
Jesus inside of me
Jesus inside of me
