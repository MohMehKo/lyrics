And I will be the lighthouse in your sea
That's guiding you home
And I will be the lamp unto your feet
When you roam

Just cling to Me
And I'll set you free

I will be the light
When the world is blinding out your sight
I will be the light
When it's all getting blurry and covering up your eyes
I will be the light
I will be the light

I will be the sun up in your sky
That's keeping you alive
I will be the headlights in your night
When you drive

Just cling to Me
And I'll set you free

I will be the light
When the world is blinding out your sight
I will be the light
When it's all getting blurry and covering up your eyes
I will be the light

I will be the light in your night
When you lose your way, you lose your sight
I will be the light in your night
When you don't know which way to go
I will be the light in your night
When you lose your way, you lose your sight, oh

I will be the light
When the world is blinding out your sight
I will be the light
When it's all getting blurry and covering up your eyes

And I will be the light
And I will be the light
And I will be the light
When the world is blinding out your eyes
I will be the light
