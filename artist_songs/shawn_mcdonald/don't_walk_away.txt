And when I look into your eyes
I see the hurt and the confusion
The pain as it rolls down your face
And the questions in your mind
And I know, 'cause I've been there
Yes, I know, 'cause I've been there, time and time again
And don't you walk, don't you walk away
'Cause He will never desert you
He'll never let you down
Don't walk away from Him, no, no, no, no, no
You're always telling me that you don't need to change
That you're fine with who you are
When I look at you, I see you filling your life with all that you can find
Hoping and wishing this world can bring you
A little peace of mind
Well, stop looking, 'cause He's right in front of your eyes
'Cause He will never give up on you today
No, don't walk away
'Cause He'll never let you go
No, no, no, no
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
'Cause He'll never let you go today
Don't walk away from Hi
