I'm on a hunt and the hunt is after You
For You are the love that keeps me in pursuit
I'm tracking Your steps, and I'm following Your ways
All through the night and into the day

[Chorus]
I will not shake, I will not break
Til I get to You
I'm hot on Your trail
I know very well what I got to do
Oh, You feed my soul
Oh, You feed my soul

My hunger has grown from the distance of You
Satisfaction is knowing that You are my pursuit
I will not stop even though I might tire
For You are the drive that is like a raging fire
Fire burns bright
Fill my heart tonight
Well the passions burning within my soul
And I can not let this go

[Chorus]
I will not shake, I will not break
Til I get to You
I'm hot on Your trail
I know very well what I got to do
Oh, You feed my soul
Oh, You feed my soul
