Trust me
Is the skyline sliced up into pieces and broken steel and mesh
Or is the progress of process that's a natural people quest
Metal and the workings, dark and lurking in my mind
Branded neon red and blue flashes
The view from the flats is nice
I see Alice in Wonderland
I see malice in Sunderland
Mouse to house, I am this land
The were without, it's Thumberland
Smoke to a karma coma
Jamaicans do yard and roamers
Shake Bacardi's and Coke and make me laugh and
Trust me

So much stuff and many people
The future is not evil
The future is not fish and it's simple, it's efficient
Now that things are costing nothing
Is any of it good?
Come and love me, read my nothings
Blogging river floods
Dead plant planted on the window ledge
Shadows dance, glint and blend
Glance slow at the night outside
I'm God in the game
Sound rumbles in 5.1 round some corner to fight with guns
Play God in games but nothing in
Trust me

Dub step, club sweat, come get rubbed red
Play the playlist
Play the playlist
I see Alice in Wonderland
I see malice in Sunderland
House to house, I love this land
The were without, it's Thumberland

Do the wrong thing, joke it right
Span the longings and the fights
For all the oil and the toil
And the spoils of the royals
We are nothing if not nice
We are coughing if we are wise
Roll me up like a leafy spliff
Fuck that, roll me up and
Trust me

Why is there so much noise
Reading info, buying toys
We all fear of company
But we are fierce anonymously
Enter shit on the internet
Clashing people, chatting evil
But we are cheery social sorts
With the pleasing photo forward
Pass the love around and back to me
Walking down a madman's street
The music in my ears is fleeting
Struggle to shuffle to the same beat
We are nothing if not nice
We have a pretty buttered knife
Is the skyline sliced up into pieces and broken steel and strife
Anything you tell me
Yes, yes, I will believe
But again and I suspect
Again and I will leave
Slow burn a little heaven
Roaming yearnings for devon
Coburn '67
Don't work for them
Trust me

Dub step, earth run, red club sweat
Put up chests and freeze, freeze
Is the skyline sliced up into pieces and broken steel and mesh
Or is the progress of process that's a natural people quest
