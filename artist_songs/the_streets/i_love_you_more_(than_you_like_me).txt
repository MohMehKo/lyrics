We haven't even started and it's almost the end 
We never talked it over fact we never said anything 
Two of the same kinda sorts hiding thoughts 
As the small talk ebbs away the silence is awkward 
You hardly even know me and I'm starting to show that 
I hardly even know you but I like what I know 
I want to talk about it but I quake in my skin 
It'll only push you further into making decisions 
You want to like me but you are likely undecided 
The voice inside is always right which is why the awkward silence 
Not gonna risk losing you 
Which is why I'm never gonna woo-oo you 

[Chorus] 
I think I love you more, 
Than you like me 
Although I'm never sure and maybe I should want to be blind 
I think I love you more, 
Than you like me 
Because this is even crossing my mind 

Any other day and you'd have not looked twice 
The joking went along with my roll of the dice 
Purely by a chance I happened on feeling 
Really confident around the place and people 
You caught a no-hitter hitting winning strokes 
I never am a winner, I'm a lonely bloke 
Acting exciting like a man for a while 
Until you realise I can act like a child 
Eternal optimism is spurring me on to think 
That acting on your ins like this 
Might lead me to learn a secret 
But I don't really know 
Or why I think so 
It's just a good hunch 
Hunches are always right though 

[Chorus] 

I drew a drawing of you after last time I saw you 
I never felt to draw a picture like that before 
I learnt a lot about myself drawing all morning 
It was absolutely shit, I'm awful at drawing 

[Chorus x2]
