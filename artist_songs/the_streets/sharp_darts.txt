Sharp Darts Spitting Masters 
Spitting darts faster 
Shut up I'm the driver, you're the passenger 
I'll reign superior 
The pressure blows the dial on your barometer
Do you understand? 
Or do you need an interpreter? 
Now my style is distinguished 
All fires are extinguished 
Ask yer girl to sing and she'll sing this 
I'm a scientist 
Have no prejudice, that's my hypothesis 
Make your analysis, ever heard a beat like this? 
I walk the beat like a policemen 
No karma pedestrian 
In 500 years they'll play this song in museums 
I'm the bold adventurer 
UK's ambassador 
Holding up Excalibur 
Your beats are inferior 
Don't wanna embarrass yer 
So call yer solicitor 
The jury voted unanimously against ya!

Do you understand? 
Or do you need an interpreter? 
This one's fat like yer mother 
Contains enough calories 
Resonating all your favourite frequencies 
I've got a worldwide warranty 
Satisfaction guarantee 
If you ain't happy then just 
Send it right back to me 
'Spec to BC 
It's time to fuck loyalty 
One day I hope to earn some hard royalties 
From a bit of sample robbery 
Rook burglary, noise thievery 
Or wholesale piracy 
So watch yer back, I'm inclined to sample 
I'll dismantle and make you all examples
