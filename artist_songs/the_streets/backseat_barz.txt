its a fact not phoney that the tracks not pony,im attacked with desire and go higher, throw everything in on a unknowing whim,before showing our cards to the stars,

in a white room with a nice plume,night fumes, im quite new to this, light a candle, fight the angle, bought a new car and then pranged it,

bob hoskins pushed past ya, upset he lost the oscar, for mona lisa lonely geezer, when youre hot they want ya, like your a cock they block ya, knocked down, ginger hustle,whisk the game your at the door

so go get checked axel foley upset, too bad lifes drags his polio legs, but i never block heads,i can only respect, the mark round above us has suffered when go to success, allowed half of my cerebral
force the kind of people, more be nice than evil, for the rights of people more be guys deceitful, talk with lies to cheat you, crush double act, walk a mile and leave you,

crude innudendo, i might laugh, on my mood it depends though, i write bars,while you dudes play nintendo or xbox, guess what the answer is, yes what,
shadows of chess boxer,pianos eclipsed watch them played out i stay louder,and do my press ups, say iv got a filthy mouth,so f what, until i clean up my act as well as my desktop.
just let me get this dress that is on my chest off, cos my head a mess like jolie and lescot, some police are pricks only on lets stop, some gâ€™s to bitch only on lets what,
i prefer the latter, but i return to ladders, got them cos of problems, iv been hurt by adders, snakes in the grass, wont refer to rappers, names in my bars, im alert to matters, getting out of hand
like slippery soap, trying to keep a grip, no prison shit jokes, cos arts a reflection, can mirror these books,lyrically im visibly killing it though, with skinner in tow, mean feat feeling the flow, im an east london artist and im still in the stow (waltham waltham)
