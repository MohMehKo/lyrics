All these walls were never really there, 
Nor the ceiling or the chair. 
I'm eking weeks of peace at the beach 
I see the breezes weave the trees, 
These walls, you'll find, are yours and mine 
Defined not by them, I 
I'm in times that lie behind my eyelids, 
The sunset still the rising silence, 

[Chorus]
I'll not feel no fear 
Cos' I'm not really here 
I'm nowhere near here 

There's no rain on roof that grates and beats me 
My favourite tree breaking light to pieces 
Sprinkling, sharded light on me 
Throw a stone as hard as you can 
And hearing with hand not here at land 
Nothing taxi, dusting sand 
My window world spins and twirls, 
The walls then fall, I recall the sort 
White clouds white wash faded spotless 
The weighty shadows, ranges of rocks 
The cold is all illusion thought up 
Stroll on the shore, snooze and explore 
All possibilities in each new morning, 
'til satisfied reaching out, yawning 
Fish in a big dish, some rice and spice, 
Salt over shoulder, never salted so tight 
The truth I have told was silence sometimes 
But who's soul does not hide any crimes 
Wrapped in walls, encircled by work 
The walls fall - the story occurs 
No barrier, no boundary or 'low us ID's 
The freedom to stay off straight 
Be fiend or friend, cause no harm but charm - the peaceful end 

[Chorus x2]

Pale, ancient woods, strew white sandy bays 
This ugly room pales away today 
I'm swimming in the ocean 
I sink slow motion 
Fingers, toes, floating 
Every year 'til yesterday 
I see the eternal setting sea 
I compare all this to me, 
It's all fleeting momentary me 
I blink my eyes, this is reminding me 
Life lies in the blink of an eye 
The old die for reasons, new tides for seasons 
New life born is like teasing 
All these walls were really never there 
Nor the ceiling or the chair 
I'm eking weeks of peace at the beach 
I see the breezes weave the trees 
I am not here at all, 
You are dearly fooled, 
I see bristling trees, the shush at the sea 
Mischievous 
Fluttering seagulls 
No. 
I'm not trapped in a box, so I am glancing at rocks 
I'm dancing off docks 
Since this stance began 
That's where I am 

[Chorus x2]

So done.
