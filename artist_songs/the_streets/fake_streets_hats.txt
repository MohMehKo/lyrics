Two days before i finally snap from (?) a gig
I was being a twat the bass player behind the (?) cap he's belgium another bright screaming gang
Johnny drums see peeps leaving trailing gaps putting face cream on between the breaks and tracks
I needed to stop this, draw the last of my ways 
20 minutes to go the floor manager says
Been a long summer (?) band's an age i wanna dry my eyes and all the band on the stage 
(I wana see the whole crowd in Belgium)
dead silence not very nice to feel so depressed and violent
(He's fuckin' puttin moisturiser on, he's fuckin moisturisin' his face... i know YEAH)

(Some cunt is bringin up a load of fuckin shithole streets hats)
Oi, oi, (?) down the day before the crafts the hats were bought by warner staff thought they were fakes,
not thought to ask
so i (?) the audience found under the stage but i'd only just spoken ted mayham has never seen me so
darn broken
the very next day in bed in London 
with a girl i have little memory of
unable to feel anything much which was the reason why i bought my first suit
wasn't thinking at that bit on stage 
the fake streets hats were actually not fake!
