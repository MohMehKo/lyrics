look i used to love you like friday, now youre boring like sunday, we used to meet up on a monday, she knew she’ll be wifey one day, without foul we’d eat food on tuesday, somewhere like nandos,
truth is i dont wanna make big plans though, cos i know how pear shaped they can go, so i said i loved you on wednedsay, and i dont care what your friends say,cos youre my girl and your my life and your my world

not a lot i can really er, the reality of magics actually tragic, just a hand and a rabbit in a hat and some tricks, when its only the aroma of the polish on the stage, tradgedy and comedy painful creation,
a guy takes it takes it, and then he dont, your voice seems to come from way off in the smoke, but thats fucking safe with me , thats fucking safe with me, push pineapple shake the tree.
