Oi oi oi Lee Satchell you bastard
Stop trying to shag the birds and fight the geezers
Mines a Kronenberg mate
The streets

Who got the funk?

Geezers geezers geezers
Who got the funk?
Original pirate material
Day in the life of a geezer
Crispy, rosco, englands glory
Uniq, locked on, andy lewis

All Birmingham geezers
All London heads
Barnet, Brixton, Beckenham
You're listening to the streets
Original pirate material

Day in the life of a geezer
Day in the life of a geezer
This is just a groove
Just a groove.
