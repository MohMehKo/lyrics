Some people live their lives by a little red book 
The points for right lying out and guides them good 
They never really mimic every word by eye 
'Cuz if they did they'd be in a whole world of strife 
The book's quite old school, but then it was tough 
It contains some quite experimental justice 
The thinking people are thinking that without this book 
That without these verses we'd pillage and murder but, 
Following this red book word for word 
Leads you to actually pillage and murder 
Could it be so what we think to be right, 
Is simply the opinion that survived? 

Do what you think's right, and you will feel alright 
'Cuz when you're bad you will feel sad 
That's the religion I live by 

There's a bloke in the book who made everything 
He knows every individual and every trick in them 
Way above emotion, never getting stressed 
But when men choose against him, gets jealous 
People fight for him in crippling wars 
But since he has the power of infinite awe 
We're merely itching on futilities floor 
Should we really be needing to assist him at all? 
If he loves us all, knowing all we think 
Should he only like people with faith in him? 
Given I can't control what I truly believe, 
Can I be forgiven for only believing who I see? 

Do what you think's right, and you will feel alright 
'Cuz when you're bad you will feel sad 
That's the religion I live by 
Do what you think's right, and you will feel alright 
'Cuz when you're bad you will feel sad 
That's the religion I live by 

Could it be time to avoid this bush? 
So we wouldn't be blind when joining up coulds 
Could we see both sides of the coin for the good? 
Breed less strife on our voyage for good? 
Getting threatened by men with questions 
We'll never get anywhere rejecting evidence 
Could we test everything instead of betting, 
On alleged legends? 
If we teach that it's right to blindly believe 
If we reach to the sky to define our meaning 
Well I agree what's right will keep driving people to fight with people 

Do what you think's right, and you will feel alright 
'Cuz when you're bad you will feel sad 
That's the religion I live by
