Stop for a minute, dont make a move
Like you dont have much to prove
Standing there hands in the air
Like you dont have much to care

A you cant say what you B
I dont C what you see
I hear a meloDy
To drop with a mellow E
Hell not, never give an F
Never shit a G
Never dinged the H
Why you lying to my I
DJ be careful with the K
Before everyday blaze L
The condemned will all condem and theM theN remember O
I used to want the P but I'd rather do not Q
I dont wanna hear R 
I dont wanna hear S too
Sit back and sip T
It starts but not U
Or I'll give you straight V
Single me double you (W)
No stress life from your X
Dont angle to no Y yes
Its only ever the way with your sket from A to Z

Stop for a minute
