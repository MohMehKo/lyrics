its envy, mike skinner
yo, the robots are taking over, the robots are taking over,
stop
catch the light of understanding learn the night is underhanded, on the grass the fall of blossom ,all alone and lost, we are not progressing but technology does, by that definition it will plod on by us
reliance on science and the compliant as the highest until china decides on defiance with fire, and takes out our science with a virus outside the one sight in the sky giving a right old blinding
automated ways may be lazier than late,assisted by the crunching of the things we used to lunch on,taxi to the airport, packed up in a flare up,whacked out say a prayer for,sat with all that hair at zero cost to build,now on distribution bills clever algorithms selling things that might appeal.
slip off your shoes, trip on some glue,slip off your muse give us a clue

look these days lifes so treacherous,coalition toon sketching us and if they take it all whats left for the rest of us seems like theres no hope left in us, cos theyve been watching us testing us, now theyre at the airports undressing us,giving out signals and we dont know how its affecting us- nah

look, i dont wanna be an outcast, but my emails spam 3000 downcast, im about to blast off, feeling like a cast off, with all of this rap stuff,even with venom im pissed off,trying to make protest, talk to many im like (unable to hear)
i make it look easy peasy please believe in capital f to r i am the s making the money like stevie, dont give a shit abotu the rest im easy, peasy, done no, too much styling for one flow,so trying to up my income and you get more kicks than drum roll.
whoever invented them saved the day, and i dont wanna rain on they parade to pave the way but its never gonna stay the same, but for the jobs tailor made, my mind used to be as sharp as a razor blade,now they know my password, and my pin code, my favourite colour and my mums maiden name.

we used to control it but now we let it control us, made it to connect us but it turns it into loners, now they double check our names and act like they dont know us and f one day they turn then they will certainatley dethrone us.
