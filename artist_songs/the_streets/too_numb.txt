You sneak in when i am asleep, too numb to be afraid,tiptoes creep, the first heartbeats, i may never wake

one of those mornings when the cars colder than the street, pour the kettles contents on the old windscreen, grilling bacon on foil,
you may as well fry it, the good that its doing for you boy.exhaust fumes and the frost look no different to your breath,but for the blueness and the thickness and a depth,
the scraping goes through me vibrating my shoes, but happy i am as i pause for the thought, only two moments i was dreaming,toasty and slowly i showed up in realism
the day will be bright, and the days less figting, when the sun becomes uppermost skybound and light, i meet with my love and we talk about presents and the present, presented with bevvies and scent of the plesant,
tapping technology and the lack of all knowledge, i tap into age old romance novels,

cold will blow through the doors but only make it to the unlucky first table, cold will blow through the doors but i will not pause from the fable that im uttering baby, cold will blow through the doors,

you sneak in when i am asleep, too numb to be afraid, tiptoes creep, the first heartbeat, i may never wake, yeah the more that i fight the more that i like i know,its not really here its all in my head and i know

blinking thoughts, thinking how i felt for you, shrinking like the stomach of a corpse, but were alive,just, stuck in a vibe that hides behind the mind of a negative force.of course im sure
as i go back for more, sealed wityh a kiss while our lips talk drunk from liqeur,wake up head sore back to where we were before,blood splatted up the walls, highs and lows, turning myself into one of those social networking pros
not concerning my emotions aint hurting im cold numb as im waiting for this story to unfold, like gum i pop non stop until the flavours all gone, thinking like a mathemetician two minus one,add suspicion then im gone
its like i like him thinking that im out doing something wrong, im sorry baby, im lazy,i dont like working when a job underpays me, then i open the door, let the cold blow in. i let the cold blow in , me and him,and then im gone in the wind, gone in the wind , gone in the wind.

you sneak in when i am asleep too numb to be afraid, tiptoes creep te first heartbeat, i may never wake, yeah the more that i fight is the more that i like and i know, its not really here its all in my head and i know.
