I wish I could read what his eyes are sayin' 
Staring straight and not blinking 
He's not giving anything away 
What is he thinking? 
I wish I could read what his eyes are sayin' 
Staring straight and not blinking 
He's not giving anything away 
What is he thinking? 

Can't seem to do anything but stare 
My C.P coat is lyin' just there 
Draped over the edge of that dusty chair 
All fits into place suddenly 
Yeh my coat was hangin up under my stairs 
But one day it went leaving the cupboard bare 
The facts all click in and become square 
He stole it while I was unaware 
But why's he denying it when it's so bate 
Looking at the telly, won't look over straight 
Why's he not flappin' and explaining away? 
To one very fuckin' frustrated mate 
Dan's been trustin' every word Scott says 
He believes in mates so fair play 
But Scott's story is too far outweighed 
And I'm gonna act before its too late 

I wish I could read what his eyes are sayin' 
Staring straight and not blinking 
He's not giving anything away 
What is he thinking? 
I wish I could read what his eyes are sayin' 
Staring straight and not blinking 
He's not giving anything away 
What is he thinking?

This must all look a bit weird 
It's Mike's C.P coat sittin here 
Draped over the chair 
So that it appears to all fit me up suddenly 
And clear i'm gonna have to just try and volunteer 
An answer 'bout the man who left the bomber here 
He must've picked it up from Mikes dear 
Girls house When the weather wasn't clear 
The man must've thought it was Simone's coat 
We didn't think it was Mike's coat though 
I can't just deny it cos my face shows 
Lookin at the telly's not aidin', no 
I can't tell Mike this man didn't know 
And innocently borrowed the coat at Simone's 
Cos then Mike would demand to know 
Why this man was even at Simone's 

[Mike] That frown could mean anything 
[Wayney G] What the fuck am I gonna do now? 
He know's I'm lyin' 
[Mike] I wish I could read his mind 
[Wayney G] It's written all over my face 

I wish I could read what his eyes are sayin' 
Staring straight and not blinking 
He's not giving anything away 
What is he thinking? 
I wish I could read what his eyes are sayin' 
Staring straight and not blinking 
He's not giving anything away 
What is he thinking?

What the fuck's he saying she had the garm' 
Either he has gone John Barnes 
Or he's tryin to spin me a con's yarn 
He think's he's the fucking don gar 
How long have I undergone his smarm? 
Shruggin' it all off as fun charm 
If he don't stop lookin' at the TV though 
I'm gonna wrap the cable round his wee throat 
Hang on Scott says Simone had the coat 
Where did he see her on the d.low 
What is it I don't need to know? 
Is he scheming to be near Simone? 
In the club I wondered what was on the go 
Dan was tryin to keep Scott from being close 
And Scott teefed me money and his teefed me coat 
And he's trying to steal me girlfriend from under me nose 

I wish I could read what his eyes are sayin' 
Staring straight and not blinking 
He's not giving anything away 
What is he thinking? 
I wish I could read what his eyes are sayin' 
Staring straight and not blinking 
He's not giving anything away 
What is he thinking?

Right I can't be bothered with this no more 
I'm gonna have to tell him I owe him the score 
I wish I could tell him about the dough on the draws 
That's somethin' I don't know, I swore 
The coat thing will look dodgy loads more 
If I don't throw it down as the crow soars 
I'd better put the video on pause 
Face up toe-to-toe over the floor 
He really needs to know how his jacket 
Miraculously appeared round my gaff, here 
And the man that left it's been shagging 
Mike's girl behind Mike's back and thing 
This shit's all got a bit out of hand 
There's no options I'm all down on plans 
I'm jus' gonna have to split it now, man 
Tell Mike the person that bought the coat round 
Was...................Dan
