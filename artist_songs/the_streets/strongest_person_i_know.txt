One of the first things about you I did see 
Is that you verse your views quietly 
When nature verses truths I get violent feelings 
But softly time will reply that's wise 

A delicate gesture of why you see 
The best route through this being right through here 
But met with a cute blind snide of fear 
Best to go along with their idea 

But, you gently take things slowly 
You softly bowl them over 
That's the delicate way you've shown me 
You're the strongest person I know 

You gently take things slowly 
You softly bowl them over 
That's the delicate way you've shown me 
You're the strongest person I know 

After taking the worst route, blatantly 
Bang on cue we manage losing way 
But in a squirmy backed and screwed up way 
They actually managed passing you the blame 

With that mad man wrapped with rage 
Even then your temper stays exactly the same 
And in that manner is the manner you stay 
Beautiful person that's happily unchanged 

You gently take things slowly 
You softly bowl them over 
That's the delicate way you've shown me 
You're the strongest person I know 

You gently take things slowly 
You softly bowl them over 
That's the delicate way you've shown me 
You're the strongest person I know 

In the heat of speech 
Your words improve 
Right out of reach in my stirred up words 
But every time they f**king blurt out drool 
I'm noticing they're all learning from you 

Cos even though they know they cursed you 
They should've admitted that they were fools 
The next time they're wanting to work things through 
The very first person they turn to is you 

Cos you gently take things slowly 
You softly bowl them over 
That's the delicate way you've shown me 
You're the strongest person I know 

You gently take things slowly 
You softly bowl them over 
That's the delicate way you've shown me 
You're the strongest person I know 

You gently take things slowly 
You softly bowl them over 
That's the delicate way you've shown me 
You're the strongest person I know
