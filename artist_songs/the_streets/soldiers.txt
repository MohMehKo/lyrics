We line the streets like soldiers daily
To let them know that we ain't fading
This is a beat, you can see it in my eyes
It's gonna stay like this, it's gonna stay like this

We line the streets like soldiers daily
To let them know that we ain't fading
This is a beat, you can see it in my eyes
It's gonna stay like this until they realize

Eighty thousand people in a state of rowdy fever
There will never be a sequel to this evening
Singing in the rafters, in the wings and over galleys
And then after all the laughing, just a draught

From the wings and over galleys 'til I'm in a lonely alley
If a feeling from my childhood comes to me then I will rally
With all the cloves and all the rose tinted rows that go and sully
Soak up that moment, woe is the finale

Lonely, I am sinking in and over thinking it
Looking at the goal, only slowly it is shrinking
Hesitate, hesitate, hesitate, wait
Any day, any day
(Too late)

We line the streets like soldiers daily
To let them know that we ain't fading
This is a beat, you can see it in my eyes
It's gonna stay like this, it's gonna stay like this

We line the streets like soldiers daily
To let them know that we ain't fading
This is a beat, you can see it in my eyes
It's gonna stay like this until they realize

The cheapest throwaway shades are my deepest stowaway aid
I'm up with the angels but keep a toe in the trade
Known these folks since I was little but only through this ritual
It's a pity they don't know me but what is there else than this?

Sweeping and sweeping, the speaking unceasing
From steeple to steeple, the people are shrieking
Soon we parade through the fence, absolutely Dame Judy Dench'd
And then stop, tell them to score and they flop

I don't think I like this, I'm only ever nervous
I'm a fighter, I'm a fighter but tonight I'd like to flight
Hesitate, hesitate, hesitate, wait
Any day, any day
(Too late)

We line the streets like soldiers daily
To let them know that we ain't fading
This is a beat, you can see it in my eyes
It's gonna stay like this, it's gonna stay like this

We line the streets like soldiers daily
To let them know that we ain't fading
This is a beat, you can see it in my eyes
It's gonna stay like this until they realize

The past isn't over, last minute grow
Ask me to show you, ask me to go
Or stab me in the throat
Hesitate, hesitate, hesitate, wait
Any day, any day
(Too late)
