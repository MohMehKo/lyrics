Everybody do the dodo
Everybody do the dodo
Everybody do the dodo
Everybody do the dodo
Everybody do the dodo
Everybody do... everybody's gotta do the dodo!

[Hook:]
It's not Earth that's in trouble
It's the people that live on it, no no
Earth'll be here long after we've all gone the way of the dodo
[x2]

I can't imagine the day when things have actually faded away
But the day I may not be able to pay my way could be today
It's not that I don't care, just that I'm way too caught up with breathing air
To grieve for the trees and air or how breathable air is
You go first, I'll follow suit
Make the mistakes I'd probably make
I'm right behind you but don't expect me to ride like it's a race
Cause you'll be back there picking scraps while I'm Mr. Mug, do-gooding around
And I've lost my rank and base
I've got to manage my little space

[Hook x2]

I'm not a stereotypical give-you-what-I-want-when-I-want-it with a big cherry on it
Just another brother trying to love my son and mother
Providing for my wife is the vibe I'm on in life
I might well starve, that's what would happen if I started off this march
It's not my world but I'm in it to win it
Put it in the bin if you push it, listen
Let's all start at the same point
Following rules equally losing tell me if it does
I wish it be true, but never gonna happen, we are not equal
For the kids let's make the rules
But I saw the film and hated the sequel

[Hook x2]

Everybody do the dodo

You and me are family
Pass the love round, then back to me
Two and three, that's the feeling
Scramble for the top, for the bottom of the ceiling
Conspiracy theories, we all hear these
We will seal the deal
We will seal the deal
If you don't know where you're going then any road will take you there
If you don't know where you're going then any road will take you there
If you don't know where you're going then any road will take you there
We do not know where we're going
Any road

[Hook x2]

These are my wings, this is my beak
