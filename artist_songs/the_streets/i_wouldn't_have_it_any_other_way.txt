I should be standing at the bar
Waving a ten pound note around
But I sit here on the sofa at my girl's house
I should be chatting shit as I'm nubbing out another snout
But I'll roach a spliff watching the TV for now

I should be watching the fruit machines
For which one will pay out
But I sit on the sofa at my girls
Any how

I should be legging it from a cab
Like a mad little lout
But I'll roach a spliff watching the TV
Throughout

I know I never tell her
But every single day man
I'm always thinking loads about her
She's the best thing that ever happened to me
And I don't know what I'd do without her

I should actually go out and about
Flip some beer mats
Instead of sitting her at my girls gaff
Because all I seem to do is sit in this habitat
Just roaching a spliff, watching the TV and that

And the TV at my house is a bit broken on the back
So I use my girls TV to watch the match
Yeah, I might head out later
To get off this beaten track
Of watching the TV, roaching up
On the same old mat

I know I never tell her
But every single day man
I'm always thinking loads about her
She's the best thing that ever happened to me
And I don't know what I'd do without her

But on second thought
I won't do shots
No, I think I'll sit on the sofa
And eat my TV meal
I would actually much prefer to just sit here and chill
Roaching a spliff, watching East Enders or the Bill
Because basically I love her
And I love being here still
And I love sitting on the sofa
With my girl
For real
I don't want to knock my mates
But there it's the same old drill
Roaching a spliff and watching the TV is my will

I know I never tell her
But every single day man
I'm always thinking loads about her
She's the best thing that ever happened to me
And I don't know what I'd do without her

No fuck that
I might ask my mates where they'll be drinking
From the sofa, giving them a ding
Tell them
I will go three's on that gram
Later on this evening
Instead of roaching a spliff, watching the TV again
And then go out whilst back at her's
She does her thing
Sitting on the sofa at her end
But as I watch the big screen
I know I will quite miss
Me and her roaching a spliff
Watching the TV again

I know I never tell her
But every single day man
I'm always thinking loads about her
That's exactly what I'm talking about
She's the best thing that ever happened to me
I wouldn't have it any other way
I'll tell you this
And I don't know what I'd do without her
I know I never tell her
There's a whole world out there
But every single day man
A whole world
I'm always thinking loads about her
She's the best thing that ever happened to me
But do I give her
Do you know what I mean
And I don't know what I'd do without her
There's a whole world out there

I've got one packet
Of rizzler over there
but it's nearly run out
I've got bits of cigarette
All over the place
Mmmmhmmm
The clipper needs a shake
The ashtray needs emptying
But I wouldn't have it any other way
I said I wouldn't have it any other way
I said I wouldn't have it any other way
I wouldn't have it any other way
I wouldn't have it any other way
I wouldn't have it any other way
I wouldn't have it any other way
oooohoooo
No I wouldn't
No I wouldn't

I said the ashtray needs emptying
I said the clipper needs a shake

But I
Need the same thing as yesterday
Hey hey
Ho ho
I wouldn't have it any other way
I wouldn't have it any other way
