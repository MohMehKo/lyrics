I had a funny dream and I came to screaming 
That I was in a funny house but it was kind of mine
And I was with you only it wasn’t you
It happened in the past but it was somehow now

It put it into focus, things became clear
I had to plan something I handed in my notice
Even though to most it looked random
My heart had left I was just going in tandem

[Chorus:]
(I smoked one too many cigarettes
I heard one too many lies
And I’ve gambled on too many bets
I lost it all to this life)
I’m packing up my desk I’ve put it into boxes (...to this life)
Knock out the lights, lock the locks and leave

I’ll leave one evening be seen off
At a party for my parting in a bar
It starts on the early side and ends in a gutter
With a fumble with a colleague in a car

No more alarm that barks in the dark
With the beeping like darts to the heart
Yes, the maze it does look deep
And days are over for dozing on my cheek

(I smoked one too many cigarettes
I heard one too many lies
And I’ve gambled on too many bets
I lost it all to this life)
I’m packing up my desk I’ve put it into boxes (...to this life)
Knock out the lights, lock the locks and leave

Read the funny card signed by all
That was purchased by the person I will always recall
Lock away my labors, steel stationary
A kiss on the lips or a grin in a grip

I had a funny dream and I came to screaming 
That I was in a funny house but it was kind of mine
And I was with you only it wasn’t you
It happened in the past but it was somehow now

I came to it noon through the tune of a spoon
In a mug in a room, but I knew very soon
That the mug in the room, was the mug yours truly
Because I never stood up for what I wanted to do

(I smoked one too many cigarettes
I heard one too many lies
And I’ve gambled on too many bets
I lost it all to this life)
I’m packing up my desk I’ve put it into boxes (...to this life)
Knock out the lights, lock the locks and leave

(I smoked one too many cigarettes
I heard one too many lies
And I’ve gambled on too many bets
I lost it all too this...
I smoked one too many cigarettes
I heard one too many lies
And I’ve gambled on too many bets
I lost it all too this life)
I’m packing up my desk I’ve put it into boxes (...to this life)
Knock out the lights, lock the locks and leave (...to this life)
