that girl on the floor, said she came through the door, make me want more

she talked me through the motions while she walked me through the emotions.
caught the line and showed up like a stork that brings the baby
caught me looking ravey so she took me to the tap
walked me down from craziness and bought me one more can,
i ought to maybe praise thee on your walking and your tan
but its awkward in this raving you have saved me from the madness
pass me the throw now pass til go rasta run so blast it on broken blast to this showjump blast through control

she bought me brandy and baileys til i started feeling wazy
i thought it was the dj playing biggy babe baby but i was on the never high but her plan was to take me to the sun,
shes on the page 3 but she buys the mirror daily,her eyes pierce me and daze me, saving a fortune for the baddest lady,thinking i called her the a team
i got girls in the north, girls in the south,she caled me all silly but really i aint no peter andre, had about two that i took to a rendez- vouz

the girl on the floor said she came through the door make me want more

more than a look more than a snog,more than a ting a little bit want a sneak peek at the clitoris,that might lead to the bedroom lights dimming it
clap clap like the movies ,groovy

the girl on the floor said she came through the door make me want more

more than a kiss more than a hug, more than a  teeny little bit head to weed clash,pour sinner in and i know boys like girls like der de der de der der
but where there is more for the thrill of it its different

girl the reason i feel funny, is the season to have fun see, is the season to spend money

girl the reason i feel funny, is the season to have fun see, is the season to spend money.
