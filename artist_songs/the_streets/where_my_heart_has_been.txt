It's time to go low, It's time to go low
Is this space where my heart has been?
It's time to go low, It's time to go low
Is this space where my heart has been?

Don't give them what they think they want just give them what they need
I don't wanna want what I want but I know that your heart bleeds

It's time to go low, It's time to go low
Is this space where my heart has been?

From my heart that is defective passed my bark that says I'm weak
I never parked on art for sex, I parked with what's effected
part of that is what is gone before, shards of my own law
shattered so they can't say I ever parked up for the score
I make music that's what I'll do with it, we'll hang together ruefully
but to a ruthless melody I'll hang these boots on me
I ran with the best but panned on the test that is for yes
And when the lights go out we run the plight that we're about
Don't give them what they think they want just give them what they need
I don't wanna want what I want but I know that your heart bleeds
We all happen to hang our heads here, I lost sight of that fact in fear

Is this space where my heart has been?

Don't underestimate me friends, we don't know who's ahead til the end
I might spend all day with it and then pan the night away and make
nil and none and nan, so Jill and John and Jen can kill and con with Ken
for their fill and fun with friends
For all your pills and pons and penny I'm still stunned but sunny
over the hill - honey, anyway you've willed it one but when will it spill what we spon and span
I have skill with skunk and skanks
We still not act ABEND - don't underestimate me friend
Didn't I make it easy, didn't I make it free
loyality is free when all the people see the dream
I've started so I finished even if the start is the beginning,
they aren't in this, they partied willing

It's time to go low, It's time to go low
Is this space where my heart has been?
It's time to go low, It's time to go low
Is this space where my heart has been?

Don't give them what they think they want just give them what they need
I don't wanna want what I want but I know that your heart bleeds
Take your flunky and dangle, fake your funk and handle it
I make funk on any angle, and get some kind of age old fangul
time put down can be irrelevant of gain
that's the element of pain - for the blessing of the game
I might spend all day praying - pannying every kind of way
tapping the pencil henceforth - forever in a day
and suffer for nothing - that's the glough - I fucking love it bruv
what goes in don't come out, joke jump in a shout

It's time to go low, It's time to go low
Is this space where my heart has been?
It's time to go low, It's time to go low
Is this space where my heart has been?

You and me forever walking

It's time to go low, It's time to go low
Is this space where my heart has been?
It's time to go low, It's time to go low
Is this space where my heart has been?
