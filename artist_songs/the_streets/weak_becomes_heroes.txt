Turn left up the street
Nothing but grey concrete and dead beats
Grab something to eat
Maccy D's or KFC
Only one choice in the city
Done voicing my pity now lets get to the nitty gritty
Tune reminds me of my first e
polite, unique, still sixteen and feeling horny
Point to the sky feel free
A sea of people all equal smiles in front and behind me
Swim in the deep blue sea cornfields sway lazily
All smiles all easy where you from, what you on and what's your story
Mesmerizing tones rising pianos this is my zone so stop cloning
Pick paper scissors or stone
Cause me and you are same i known you all my life i don't know your name
The names European Bob sorted anyway
Gonna have dance now see you later please to meet you
Likewise a pleasure

[Chorus (x2):]
We were just standing there minding our own
And it went on and on
We all smile we all sing
The weak become heroes then the stars align
We all sing we all sing all sing

The night slowly fades and goes slow motion
All the commotion becomes floating emotions
Same piano loops over
Arms wave eyes roll back and jaws fall open
I see in soft focus
Chattin to this bloke in the toilets
Dizzy new heights blinded by the lights
These people are for life its all back to his place at the end of the night
They could settle wars with this
If only they will imagine the worlds leaders on pills then imagine the morning after
Wars causing disaster don't talk to me i don't know ya
But this ain't tomorrow and for now i still love ya
Hours fly over sail round diamonds and pearls never seen so many fit girls
Discover new worlds look at my watch can't focus
Last two hours i lost every move fills me with lust
All of life's problems i just shake off
Mad little events happen things map out and a few blue maddens alight the toilets
Big beefy bouncers out to reveal us geezers on e's and first timers kids on whizz darlins  on
Charlie
All come together for this party
All races many faces from places you never heard of
Where you from what's your name and what you want
Sing to the words flex to the fat one
The tribal drums the sun's rising we all smile we all sing

[Chorus x2]

Then the girl in the cafAÂ© taps me on the shoulder
I realize five years went by I'm older
Memories smoulder winters colder
But that same piano loops over and over and over
The road shines and the rain washes away
The same Chinese takeaway selling shit in a tray
It's dark all round I walk down same sight same sounds new beats though
Solid concrete under my feet
No surprises no treats the world stands still as my mind sloshes round
The washing up bowl in my crown
My life's been up and down since i walked from that crowd

[Chorus x2]

Out of respect for Johnny Walker,
Paul Okenfold, Nicky Hollaway, Danny Rampling,
And all the people who gave us these times,
And to the government I stick my middle finger up
With regards to the criminal justice bill,
For all the heroes I met along the way

[x2]
The weak become heroes and the stars align
We all sing, we all sing, sing,

[Chorus x2]
