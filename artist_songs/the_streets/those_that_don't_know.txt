There's those that don't know
Those that don't know that they don't know
There's those that don't know
Those that don't know that they don't know

From the north to the south, from the east and west
London town is busy at best
With the kicks to the chest and the dips and the crests
(Fall asleep)
Fall asleep past your stop, creeping
Past 11 o clock in the morning, no dawn's ever boring

Sometimes I lie in the bath 'til it's cold
Nothing but a laugh to the front in the back of my soul
I wanna live forever, give my best guess
'Cause that's the best you'll get is a guess, but no less

Smoke in the chest, hold it in, 'til it's in your skin
Inhale this hardly smoke, that's a hardy toke
Flip flops and your shorts or the big dogs on the porch
'Til the night on the scorch, I light like a torch

There's those that don't know
Those that don't know that they don't know
There's those that don't know
(Two stoned)
Those that don't know that they don't know

Hunky dory all evening, at a 140bpm
'Til it's done sort of in the a.m. or you've done talkin' or it's mayhem
At the cornucopia, doped up, the local shops a mere toe-tap
Vocal in focus on the buying your papers and fire drill
And the brightest shades of milk, we look a mighty shady ilk

Memories of a long lost eon
Millions of stars out there, which one might you be on?
It's like Jupiter's moon in this room get the heat on
I need a  stencil to follow my pencil, pensive and sensing
Smoke in your chest, hold it in 'til it's in your skin
Inhale this hardly smoke, that's a hardy toke

There's those that don't know
Those that don't know that they don't know
There's those that don't know
Those that don't know that they don't know

You know me, I always detest the dawn
The grass always looks like it was left on the lawn
You talk around events and from side of your sight
The Benson burns, it reflects in your eyes

There's those that don't know
Those that don't know that they don't know
There's those that don't know
Those that don't know that they don't know
