It's his lucky day, thats a given 
He'll tick the box on the slip, and then just watch and learn 
He's not addicted, he can stop anytime 
But this is gonna pay, he feels it this one'll be fine 
This time I know Im gonna smash the bet 
I foresee it smacked in the back of the net 
Men grip slips, wipe their hands that sweat 
The camera pans the away fans end 
Twenty quid for blues to thrash the reds 
Then cash that cash, when the ref has said 
My mates out, his pads a mess 
Its getting late, I've not dashed yet 
The question I have to ask myself 
Is can I see us not battering them? 
If I cant see that, happening then 
Im gonna put all my money down on one fat bet 
Now I dont know the first thing about football 
But my instincts tell me this is my windfall 
It's his lucky day, thats a given 
He'll tick the box on the slip, and then just watch and learn 
He's not addicted, he can stop anytime 
But this is gonna pay, he feels it this one'll be fine 
This time I know I woulda cashed the lot 
I woulda held in my hand the whole jackpot 
The games won, the ends have a swap 
2-0 up they're getting mashed up 
But I wont win now, the chance flopped 
Cause I couldnt make it to the damn shop 
Might aswell put tea in that pot 
Ive got nowhere else I have to bop 
The question I have to ask one 
Is how I managed, not to manage the trot 
Maybe I could phone in and slap it on 
Put all my money on a mid-match one 
Yes, I dont know the first thing about football 
But my instincts tell me this is my windfall 
It's his lucky day, thats a given 
He'll tick the box on the slip, and then just watch and learn 
He's not addicted, he can stop anytime 
But this is gonna pay, he feels it this one'll be fine 
Shit, I'm mad glad I didnt back that match 
Suppose to be an unproblematic catch 
Full time the whistle blasted after 
The last passer, passed the last pass 
Would you believe how we fell back 
Three goals lost in the last half 
So glad I was stranded back at the flat 
Wincing at every goal we let em have 
The question I now have to ask 
Is how the fuck did we get smashed that bad? 
I just very, very nearly, nearly 
Lost every penny of all my cash 
Yes, I dont know the first thing about football 
And my instincts almost led me to a pitfall 
It's his lucky day, that was barmy 
He didnt tick the box on the slip, and what a relief 
He's not addicted, he can stop anytime 
But next time he will be more lucky, next time he'll be fined 
[x2]
I need to rethink the technique of my betting shit 
Maybe change the parameters a little bit 
Instead of betting on to win the football 
I'll bet to lose the cricket
