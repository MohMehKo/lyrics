minding my own

im just minding my own, as you do, im just minding my own as you do, i got a mind of my own, so im just minding my own, just minding my own as you do.

look i got a peace of mind, cos i know i can walk on the streets at night, now i had a dark past, but now i got a bright future, some dont want me to see the light,
it seems alike, why, cos they got their mind on mine,now i dont mind, but my clocks ticking, i got my mind on time,im not spitting for the lime or light ,im spitting cos i decide to write the rhymes i write
i ride the track,
im underground, mind the gap, im a gold mine, and im so grime, but you, you got bars and flow, minus fans, minus drag, look i dont mind you , fly your flag, they say two minds are better than one, but who minds im better than one.

im just minding my own, as you do, im just minding my own as you do, i got a mind of my own, so im just minding my own, just minding my own as you do.

from starry eyes to far up starry skies, satellites high above make day and night quite alike, for the eagle eyed theres many legal highs, since the old legal guys made the old highs illegal,
straight as the seagull flies, paint your pallet blue and grey, but rain has the habit of doing away with any delay,in the stars we lie, twinly eyes, link the scene with smiles

im just minding my own, as you do, im just minding my own as you do, i got a mind of my own, so im just minding my own, just minding my own as you do.

now i understand what you try to say to me, take my shaking hand and try and take the lead, im in a million places scattered all around my brain, a thousand little sensations all sayign the same, i see voices in my head is what aristottle said, or maybe it was plato,
it dont matter there all dead, to the grey matter in my head.

im just minding my own, as you do, im just minding my own as you do, i got a mind of my own, so im just minding my own, just minding my own as you do.
im just minding my own, as you do, im just minding my own as you do, i got a mind of my own, so im just minding my own, just minding my own as you do.
