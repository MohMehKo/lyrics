the inkling to think could bring me to the brink, why do i fear because it keeps me here, alone in the multiplex i think my fate, i drink my fizzy post mix too quick,
the green man glowing at the exit sign, ice cream that will melt before the feature flicks, films arent as good as tv anymore, theres so many shows that i know i want to score,
but films from the trailers these days look waste, like a gun in the hand of a desperate character, fun in the land of disparate savages, like all your natural movements however habitual become seperate acts of action, teary sarges and burned up sears
weary marchers return to cheers, i want to speak to the preacher middle men riddle me, two hours in the dark is something like a shower, solitude is excelllent for sorrow like bolllywood set peices that borrow from hollywood,
wherof we cannot speak therefore we must be slient, why would i be hungry for a younger year, cos im nineteen hundred and seventy eight years younger than the current year.

yo, i was born a winner, born again sinner, eating gravy, three course dinner,im on a rap with skinner,no chinchilla, mc serial killer,illa, you better know boy better know better, original pirate materials better
sarge on the streets dont get no better,double o one i was locked in a cellar, locked in a dungeon locked in a basement, forget the beat ill spit accapella,bring other mcs sound better,come through start changing weather
smoking cheese, make it cheddar, eating great i aint no better,you aint so solid, you dont know mega,mc get rolling up that cellar. bust them away with the current, jump on a guy thats eating blackcurrant, everyone hates murkel who doesnt, but boy better know im always burrent
always coming and always here,new mcs that are always there mcs want to get away always there but i swear on my life its always air,i tell them do some work, im the captain call me kirk, play the beat rude boy and murk, im on the mike MC from bath
i tell them do some work, im the captain call me kirk, play the beat rude boy and murk, im on the mike MC from bath
