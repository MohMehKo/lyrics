Everybody

I sleep with one eye open, sometimes I might close them
But if immediate action is required, I'm fucking loaded
I know my exit strategies and I never plan anything
So in fifteen minutes, I can be absolutely anywhere
Within radio contact, for once I'm on point
And the contacts are noisy, we go dark

'Cause life goes pretty slow
If you don't even show up for the show, you might never know

I'll go out without a blink, out without a blink
I'll go downtown without thinking and shout over a drink
I'll go out without a blink, out without a blink
I'll go downtown without thinking and shout over a drink
All the people in the place
All the people in the place

Any hesitation, anything tying you to the bed where you sleep
You're dead on your feet
There's nothing on my person but money in a shirt
In case any unexpected fun shit should occur
Where I have to think on my feet and plan it on my own
Hand to hand solo or tab it back home

'Cause life goes pretty slow
If you don't even show up for the show, you might never know

I'll go out without a blink, out without a blink
I'll go downtown without thinking and shout over a drink
I'll go out without a blink, out without a blink
I'll go downtown without thinking and shout over a drink
All the people in the place
All the people in the place

Take time in any new environment to relax
But if fenced in advance, the best defense is attack
Piss-poor planning proceeds any corporate party
Where you don't know you're out out 'til you're shouting
Don't hang back like a bore, bags packed by the door
Rags in a black backpack and the dashed in passport

'Cause life goes pretty slow
If you don't even show up for the show, you might never know

I'll go out without a blink, out without a blink
I'll go downtown without thinking and shout over a drink
I'll go out without a blink, out without a blink
I'll go downtown without thinking and shout over a drink
All the people in the place
All the people in the place

I'll go out without a blink, out without a blink
I'll go downtown without thinking and shout over a drink
I'll go out without a blink, out without a blink
I'll go downtown without thinking and shout over a drink
