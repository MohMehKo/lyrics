I lay right there once 
On the edge of the rock 
I was ready to jump 
I was ever so lost 
But this gentlemen stopped 
And said something I never forgot 

For billions of years 
Since the outset of time 
Every single one of your ancestors survived 
Every single person on your mums and dad's side 
Successfully looked after and passed onto you life 
What are the chances of that like 
It comes to me once in a while 
And everywhere i tell folk 
It gets the best smile 

And then the old man walked away 
And out of sight 
Till the sound of him hiking 
Turned to the sound of silence 
I juss froze in a profound surprise 
And from down on my pride 
I found a smile to my eyes 
And for many days again 
I would be passing the same cliff 
And on many occasions 
I would chance on the same thing 
Laying in the moss 
In the same way I was 
Would be another man 
Looking like he needed a change of luck 
So I'd say I lay right there once 
On the edge of the rock 
I was ready to jump 
I was ever so lost 
But this gentlemen stopped 
And said something I never forgot 

For billions of years 
Since the outset of time 
Every single one of your ancestors survived 
Every single person on your mums and dad's side 
Successfully looked after and passed onto you life 
What are the chances of that like 
It comes to me once in a while 
And every where i tell folk 
It gets the best smile 

For billions of years 
Since the outset of time 
Every single one of your ancestors survived 
Every single person on your mums and dad's side 
Successfully looked after and passed onto you life 
What are the chances of that like 
It comes to me once in a while 
And everywhere i tell folk 
It gets the best smile
