The fine art of hotel expressionism
And the sentiment with the kettlent condiments
Compose your mood using the soap and a shoe
The minibar can be part of the art

In the early hours of a blurry hotel you need guests of (?)
My word is word if you yearn success in hotel expressionism
stay away from small boutique hotels so when wrecked there's no victim
I've been ejected from hotels that then when I'm checking in will swear to be with them (swearin')
Man, I'm not some crank vandal swinging the TV about at random
Attached to the lampstand for a handle is the art of action prove (?)
Tediously mischief from (?) is why we hide from enemy pages
Throwing the TV out the window mate is nothing clear of weak clichés
It's vandalism and expressionism we keenly disassociate it
I'm talking incontrovertible structural damage human injury, real mayhem

Fill the iron with minibar brandy and blam see you have a brandy iron
Sweet boozy steam moves freely and is in no manner mindless fun
Express yourself in anyway say anything you may and anyway that man (?)
That's fucking (?) fucking cunt the fucking damage is a minor... fucker
But loud trashing is fucking drill spelling through the death of rock and roll
Rap and roll are separate to some acid trip 'cause rock and roll is fucking old
The group of girls you zone in on have to be on there oh their own there and piss
But you have a problem with the man they're with he's a dealer but there's a rift
You need to get him fucked up on his own shit take his gear he disappears
Leave him there his hand in a bucket of water gaffer taped to a chair in a lift

I'll tell you
Expressionism is his own form of art
Because with normal art someone usually the artist they pour out their heart
But it's worth is decided by committee and has to obey the law and sharks
I tell expressionists walk out the lift mind checkin' out pay for their art
Real art should be nothing but love shouldn't be about the money or fashion
I make these crap rap rhythms to pay the hotel bills that fund my passion

It's tedious the mischief from (?) is why we hide from enemy pages
Throwing the TV out the window mate is nothing clear of weak cliché
It's vandalism and expressionismists keenly disassociate to
I'm talking inconvertible, structural damage, human injury... well mayhem basically
