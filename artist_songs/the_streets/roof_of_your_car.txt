[Intro] 
Gaze up to the skies 
Truth you've open up my eye (eyes) 

[Verse 1] 
One day they're gonna make electrical implants in the brain
that simulate raving type sensations away 
I just can't imagine living without things we live with, 
can't imagine not knowing what science has learned 
One day they'll lie on the roof of their rides, 
thinking we're as stupid as we think of people before this time 
We make pains to stay sane but waste days on games, 
Online against some fucking whining little child 

[Chorus] 
On the roof of your car at the stars 
On the roof of your car at the stars 
On the roof of your car at the stars 
Through to the star 

Gaze up to the skies 
Truth you've open up my eye (eyes) 

[Verse 2] 
The things you think of when you're drinking on a bonnet 
Like how war telepathic headsets inview getting on it 
Imagine a girl at work gave you her number she wanted to flirt, 
but all thoughts to her mind are blocked until she gets off after work 
Die young stay pretty, 
try once try living 
But don't fade me up son, to the maid I love 

[Chorus] 
On the roof of your car at the stars 
On the roof of your car at the stars 
On the roof of your car at the stars 
Through to the star 

Gaze up to the skies 
Truth you've open up my eye (eyes) 

[Verse 3] 
So remind me what I said when you find me in bed 
Which I even on death lying up many men 
May I be laid out clean 
May my beats fade me green 
May I lie I may obscene 
Maybe I Maybelline 
Don't paint me black man 
Blame the sat-nav 
My way was mad man, but we made it back 

[Chorus] 
on the roof of your car at the stars 
on the roof of your car at the stars 
on the roof of your car at the stars 
Through to the star 

[Verse 4] 
On the brink of a list of insistings with a fist 
One blink and that kiss 
Is a sinking bliss 
Hats off all you 
have a blast on full view 
Things written on my wrist 
So I might think after I'm pissed 

[Chorus] 
On the roof of your car at the stars 
On the roof of your car at the stars 
On the roof of your car at the stars 
Through to the star 

On the roof of your car at the stars 
On the roof of your car at the stars 
On the roof of your car at the stars 
Through to the star 

Gaze up to the skies 
Truth you've open up my eye (eyes)
