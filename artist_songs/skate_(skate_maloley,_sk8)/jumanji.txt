[Jaxon:]
Mixin' mango in that muddy
Yeah we moving' across the country
Tell 'em sorry for the wait
But we really on the wave
I got the grass and the bubbly
I got these diamonds up on me
I'm on a wave like tsunami
And my bitches wild like jumanji [x8]

[Skate:]
These bitches wild'n for paper
These bitches for fame
These bitches in the cut
But my bitches, they know I didn't do anythang
And really I've been on my "nice guy"
But everybody wanna kill the vibe
I swear they think I'm ridiculous, getting conspicuous
I'm in my right mind
Talking this shit cause I'm so mad
I got the shit that they don't have
I can feel it in my veins
I got the passion most rappers, they don't have
Swear I'm coming up, I'm independent
Swear I'm coming up, I'm independent
Girl I'm 'bout my business so I guess Ima have to holla at you in a minute

[Jaxon:]
Mixin' mango and that muddy
Yeah we movin' across the country
Tell 'em sorry for the wait
But we really on the wave
I got the grass and the bubbly
I got these diamonds up on me
I'm on a wave like tsunami
And my bitches wild like jumanji [x8]

[Skake:]
You the type of bitch to take a molly then I see you throw up at a party, uh
You the type of bitch to pull up on me when your man is acting hella funny
We get to fucking
And we get to sexing
And we get to rocking the bed
That bitch be rocking the bed
That bitch be rocking the bed, hold up
Did I forget to mention?
I was in detention
Teacher talking, I ain't even listen
I was on a mission
Make a lil money, put momma in a mansion
That'll be the goal for the rest of the life
Rest to the peace to the rest of the life
Dance to the mike and the dress kinda tight
And they swag on a wave and they down for the fight
Hold up

Bitches want money
And bitches want paper
Bitches just wanna go out with they friends
Pour up and pour and pour up again
I can tell them one thing

[Jaxon:]
Mixin' mango in that muddy
Yeah we moving across the country
Tell 'em sorry for the wait
But we really on the wave
I got the grass and the bubbly
I got these diamonds up on me
I'm on a wave like tsunami
And my bitches wild like jumanji [x8]
