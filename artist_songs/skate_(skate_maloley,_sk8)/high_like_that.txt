Uh
Hit the mall I don't care what is cost me
Ima spend it all on my instrumental softly
This is different than the shit that I've been doing lately
For the ass hoes, dudes hating on me daily
The kid is working hard really tryna find his placement 
Spending time alone writing bars in my basement
I just wanna prove to the industry, everyone got enemies
And if so then you is not a friend of me
I drop bars make the hater respect that
I take her down and later don't text back
Always on the move, got a show where the next at?
Little bit a cash but I'm like where the rest at?
Cuz I'm never satisfied with nothing
Climbing to the top, good herb what I'm puffing
No girl cuffing
I'm tryna turn nothing into something
Hope the game is ready cuz I'm coming

Ain't ready for me
I try to tell them they ain't ready for me
Got my, whole squad in the building
Love the shit that I be feeling

Oh I, I get high like that 
I be in the club looking fly like that, oh
Looking fly like that
They ain't seen a motherfucker get high like that, oh
Oh, get high like that 
I be in the club looking fly like that, oh
Looking fly like that
They ain't seen a motherfucker get high like that, oh

I'm in the club with my fake ID
I just tip the bartender tell 'em drinks on me
Independent everything freshlee 
Got the girls tripping on me like LSD
First off I been taking flights outta Vegas
Lately a lot a people been asking what my name is
Yeah, its Skate with a capital S
Not the best but I'm coming up lot a success
Hollywood what they calling me
I don't know an apology
I been giving em all of me
Only giving em quality
Making our in economy
And I want to be a top notch star, no astronomy
Just made a deposit, bank transaction
Nothing gives you more satisfaction
Break it down, split and switch it like a fraction
Honestly I made this wanna see the fans reaction

Ain't ready for me
I try to tell them they ain't ready for me
Got my, whole squad in the building
Love the shit that I be feeling

Oh I, I get high like that 
I be in the club looking fly like that, oh
Looking fly like that
They ain't seen a motherfucker get high like that, oh
Oh, get high like that 
I be in the club looking fly like that, oh
Looking fly like that
They ain't seen a motherfucker get high like that, oh
