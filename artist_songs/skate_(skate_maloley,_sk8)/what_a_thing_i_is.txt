Work all night, sleep all day, sleep all day
Work all night, sleep all day, sleep all day
We stay real, money to make, got money to make
We stay real, money to make, got money to make

Money to make, blue hunnids in the safe
Double cuppin' for the pain, swervin' in and outta lanes
Rollin' up a blunt and kill, put some diamonds in my grill
Make sure that pint got a seal, crack it open and get trill

Play that shit, nigga, play that shit
If I'm runnin', never say that shit, never say that shit
I'm fuckin' models, never pay that bitch, never pay that bitch
I do what I want and they hate on this, yeah, they hate on this
What a thing I is

Work all night, sleep all day, sleep all day
Work all night, sleep all day, sleep all day
We stay real, money to make, got money to make
We stay real, money to make, got money to make
Work all night, sleep all day, sleep all day
Work all night, sleep all day, sleep all day
We stay real, money to make, got money to make
We stay real, money to make, got money to make

I call my dealer, bring a damn pound
So late, he tell me to turn down
Young and came up from a small town
That pressure on me, need to calm down
I take nothin', I'm offended
Dirty soda for the thirst
Got me slurrin' all my words
Take advantage of the bird
Take advantage of the time you got it
Go and live it up
Makin' movies like a cinema
Cameras everywhere, we turnin' up
Let's go make another Spike Lee
Put the autotune in the right key
If the bitch down then she like D
Then I give it to her, make her like me

Play that shit, nigga, play that shit
If I'm runnin', never say that shit, never say that shit
I'm fuckin' models, never pay that bitch, never pay that bitch
I do what I want and they hate on this, yeah, they hate on this
What a thing I is

Work all night, sleep all day, sleep all day
Work all night, sleep all day, sleep all day
We stay real, money to make, got money to make
We stay real, money to make, got money to make
Work all night, sleep all day, sleep all day
Work all night, sleep all day, sleep all day
We stay real, money to make, got money to make
We stay real, money to make, got money to make
