I been gettin' gone
I been gettin' gone

I been gettin' gone, kush is gettin' strong
Roll me up a cone, money gettin' long
Take your main girl, dick her down, send her home
And I hit the crib, roll some weed and make my song
[?], yeah
Yeah, bitch, hold up, yeah
Put my team up on the map, yeah
Wildest shit I ever had, yeah
Don't play with my money, don't play with my patience
Remember grindin', flippin' ounces for paper
I used to turn for them special occasions
But lately I been in my zone

And I been gettin' gone, I been gettin' gone
I been gettin' gone, I been gettin' gone, gone, gone
I been gettin' gone, I been gettin' gone
I been gettin' gone, I been gettin' gone, gone, gone, gone
I been gettin' gone

Rollin' dank in the crib, rollin' dank with your bitch
TCH when I piss, pullin' up to the Ritz
Poppin' bottles in the suite, [?] the weed
Air Jordans on the feet, fuckin' shawty, then I leave
And there a lot of people hittin' my phone
But I been swervin' and chillin' at home
Faded too long, I might pull up in the morn'
'Cause lately I been in my zone

And I been gettin' gone, I been gettin' gone
I been gettin' gone, I been gettin' gone, gone, gone
I been gettin' gone, I been gettin' gone
I been gettin' gone, I been gettin' gone, gone, gone, gone
I been gettin' gone
