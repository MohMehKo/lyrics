Right now I ain't worried 'bout it

Mama told me all them drugs is killin' you
But right now I ain't worried 'bout it
They tried to tell me that I need to follow rules
But right now I ain't worried 'bout it
Right now I ain't worried
Tell 'em bring my drugs in a hurry
I'm speedin' 80 in a 30
To tell the truth, man, I ain't worried
Right now I ain't worried 'bout it
Right now I ain't worried 'bout it
Right now I ain't worried 'bout it
Right now I ain't worried 'bout it

I ain't worried 'bout a damn thing
Poppin' bottles of the champagne
Stayin' high, gotta maintain
Ain't nobody on the same thing
'Nother shot of the cognac
She'll be tellin' me she want that
You know we never worried
Ballin' out, I'm like I'm Curry
Bringin' 'em through, I'm with the crew
We finna 'ford the tool
Nothin' to lose, don't follow rules
Got a lighter, we approve
I ain't never been worried
Wrist game, McFlurry
Need Xans, hit nearly
Pour up, get dirty

Mama told me all them drugs is killin' you
But right now I ain't worried 'bout it
They tried to tell me that I need to follow rules
But right now I ain't worried 'bout it
Right now I ain't worried
Tell 'em bring my drugs in a hurry
I'm speedin' 80 in a 30
To tell the truth, man, I ain't worried
Right now I ain't worried 'bout it
Right now I ain't worried 'bout it
Right now I ain't worried 'bout it
Right now I ain't worried 'bout it

Late to the party, we rollin' up
Split the swisha, then I roll the gas
Tell her, shawty, she ain't old enough
21 and over on the bus
Faded, headed to the function
All my boys bring bunches
Baggin' hoes by the bunches
Smokin' weed, gettin' munchies
I'm feelin' free, that's how it be
Off the damn GG
She sniffin' coke off the ki'
Nothin' to see, that's how it be
That's how it be when you ballin' out
Me and my bitch had a fallin' out
Pop a pilly then I pipe down
'Cause I ain't worried 'bout it right now

Mama told me all them drugs is killin' you
But right now I ain't worried 'bout it
They tried to tell me that I need to follow rules
But right now I ain't worried 'bout it
Right now I ain't worried
Tell 'em bring my drugs in a hurry
I'm speedin' 80 in a 30
To tell the truth, man, I ain't worried
Right now I ain't worried 'bout it
Right now I ain't worried 'bout it
Right now I ain't worried 'bout it
Right now I ain't worried 'bout it
