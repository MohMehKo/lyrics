For all the Fathers out there

[Chorus:]
Father, Father
Forgive me 
(Oh, Father, Father)
I know that when I'm gone you're still with me
(You're still with me)
Father, Father
Forgive me
(Oh, Father, Father)
You gave me all the guidance that I need

Uh,
This the perfect time to address
Everything I did was for the best
And I might've messed up a couple times, but
Every single day I was tryin' to impress
And I know it gets hard
Havin' a son
Watch him grow up
Now he's out havin' his fun
Sippin' liquor and you can't believe that he 21
Taught him to walk
All he wanna do is to run
I'm sorry dad
I'm sorry for the B.S.
But I think it's comin' to an end like a P.S.
The life I'm livin' 
I always wanted to be this
And I'm glad that you and momma here so you could see this

[Chorus]

Yuh,
Speakin' of guidance
Thanks to the Lord
Father forgive me cuz lately 
I think I'm sinnin' more
And even though you're not good at bein' presentable
Good God your blessings have been so plentiful
All this music I've been doing is really for you
This could be my only shot
Imma follow through
Is you listenin'?
Lately I been callin' you
Didn't hear back
I don't wanna bother you
I just wanna an answer
Come through and save us
From all this cancer
But look oops
There I go again
Beggin' for somethin'
When I really need to b showin' him love

[Chorus]
