I don't wanna go back, back, back
Look at where I'm at, at, at
Stop livin' in the past (stop livin' in the past)
Stop livin' in the past (stop livin' in the past)

I don't wanna go back to the life that I was livin' (nah)
Focused on the future in my brain I had a vision
Ever since my circumcision I was made for television
Mighta ended up in prison if I wasn't a musician
K-k-keep it 100
I roll the el and I'm bluntin'
For all the haters that fronted I got 'em now
When they wanted (they really wanted)
They wanted all
Yeah they wanted all
If your boyfriend lame girl you know who to call
Hit me on twitter @skatemaloley (yup)
I-I be gettin' cheese ass no ravioli
Everyday I wake up to a pre-rolled stogie (damn)
L-Light it up and watch the room get real smokey

I don't wanna go back, back, back
Look at where I'm at, at, at
Stop livin' in the past (stop livin' in the past)
Stop livin' in the past (stop livin' in the past)

I don't wanna go back, back, back
Look at where I'm at, at, at
Stop livin' in the past (stop livin' in the past)
Stop livin' in the past (stop livin' in the past)

I don't wanna go back, back, back
Look at where I'm at, at, at
Stop livin' in the past (stop livin' in the past)
Stop livin' in the past (stop livin' in the past)

Get your money up, get your money up though
I be reppin' Taylor gang by my chucks low (by my chucks low)
Ex-girl left didn't take her stuff though
Now I do my own thang I don't ever cuff hoe

Old life and we keepin' it there
It's the past so forget it, yeah we leavin' it there
Playin' ball on the courts I was 19 years
But now I'm something that your girlfriend likely hear

He ain't goin' no where if he ain't a little bit cocky
Killer mentality ain't nobody that can stop me
If you startin' trends thet everybody tryna to copy
You gone be the next makin' bills more than cosby

I don't wanna go back, back, back
Look at where I'm at, at, at
Stop livin' in the past (stop livin' in the past)
Stop livin' in the past (stop livin' in the past)

I don't wanna go back, back, back
Look at where I'm at, at, at
Stop livin' in the past (stop livin' in the past)
Stop livin' in the past (stop livin' in the past)

I don't wanna go back, back, back
Look at where I'm at, at, at
Stop livin' in the past (stop livin' in the past)
Stop livin' in the past (stop livin' in the past)
