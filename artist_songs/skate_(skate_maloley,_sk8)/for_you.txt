I pull up
Let's get it

I pull up in the same Nissan that I've been driven'
Nothin' ever scripted so I'm always improvisin'
You look good 'lil mamma
You know you bad
And I can't forget the times that we had
But really it's something special, what we got
Used to cruise down to the parking lot
Roll pot
And you got scared
I told you "baby girl, settle down, no cops here"
Then guess what?
I see the cops roll up
She looked at me said "Nate, why you always fuck up?"
Story of my life, I heard it plenty times
So I can put it on any of my raps at any time
And I ain't gon' mess up no more
Chasin' after dreams I go for it
Grindin' for something more and I'mma figure out for sure

There is not a time
When you ain't on my mind
I just wanna sing it for you, baby
Yeah, I'm doin' fine
But listen to this rhyme
'Cause I just wanna sing it for you, baby

I wake up
Thank God for everything that I been given
Man it's hard bein' humble with the way I'm livin'
I fight pressure, fight pain
And it's hard to realize that people know my name
Got a lot of friends that I miss, friends that don't exist
Friends that started fuckin' with me way before the shit
Got more pride and I got more love
Yeah, I'm like the truck
Man I'm built ford tough

There is not a time
When you ain't on my mind
I just wanna sing it for you, baby
Yeah, I'm doin' fine
But listen to this rhyme
'Cause I just wanna sing it for you, baby

This time it's all about the fans that been supportin'
So listen up closely 'cause really this is important
Shout out to the fans, you my written plan
On the stage, when I stand, make me feel like I'm the man
So rock with me and I'll rock with you
Now let's rock together with the music, too
So rock with me and I'll rock with you
Now let's rock together with the music, too
Bounce

There is not a time
When you ain't on my mind
I just wanna sing it for you, baby
Yeah, I'm doin' fine
But listen to this rhyme
'Cause I just wanna sing it for you, baby
