Look
Go and tell that man to ease up
Before he go and hit the stage about to freeze up
And I ain't bangin but I gotta keep my B's up
Omaha, you really think that I would leave ya?
Nobody believe ya
When you first starting off
Rhyming in ya bedroom, always pissed off
Who is telling that everything will be easy?
Nobody, so go ahead and roll another bleezy
Roll another L for ya family
Pour another cup no Stanley
Ima get a grammy
Talk about it and than you go and get with it ya team
I swear it's easier than what it seems

Some will be legends
Some will never die
And some will make it to the top
And some will even fly
And some will wake up and make a killing to inspire
And some will talk a lot while the rest stay quite

I'm trynna find my calling in life
What do it be god?
Lots of ups and downs like I'm on a seesaw
But I'm in Santa Monica chilling seaside
Rollin up another doobie on the beach side
This the sweet side
Sweet 16
I used to be the shooting guard
Now I'm assisting
I had a dream to make it possible
Fuck all the obstacles
Now I'm living tropical
I'm on the west coast chilling
Now my team about to make a killing
For real though

Ain't nobody got nothing on the fam
They gon' be here till the very end (yeah)
And ain't nobody got nothing on the man
Making sure this shit'll never end
We gon ride wit em that's fosho [x2]
We gone ride with em [x2]
