Go and get it I don't ever wanna wait 
Time fly by when you're spending all your K 
When you work hard they be on your case
Cause everybody wants a little piece of the plate
Yea we all want a little bit of success
And we all wanna shine
And we all wanna know what is up next
And we all wanna find
And we all wanna find 
Another opportunity in life where we can shine 
Wanna shine harder than the Carter
Wanna shine harder than another motherfucker that's smarter
They be like go to college do your homework
Never tell you anything to do if it don't work
So I did my own thing in my own way
Now they comin' at me sayin' Nate shoulda told me

I be in the penthouse 
Get a ticket to the penthouse 
We can kick it in the penthouse
[x2]
I be in the penthouse
We can kick it in the penthouse
Yea get a ticket to the penthouse

Money has the power to change
Put you in a all black Lamborghini switchin' the lanes
Kush on deck and a bottle of paint
As a boy I saw the lifestyle calling my name
It wasn't bout the drugs that I'm using 
It was bout the love of the music
It was bout the path that I'm choosing
It was bout the termination all the creation that I was makin' in my basement not the weight that I was moving
Sippin' it slow
Hit it like a drive thru man I get it and go
At the parties they asking if I'm hittin' the blow
And I'm like nah man I ain't even into the snow
But I'm into the flow
So I'm smokin' an oh 
Got the game by the neck and I'm choking it slow
Not like any of these cats that be hoping to go
No suicidal really I got something to show

I be in the penthouse 
Get a ticket to the penthouse 
We can kick it in the penthouse
[x2]
I be in the penthouse
We can kick it in the penthouse
Yea get a ticket to the penthouse
[x2]
I be in the penthouse
We can kick it in the penthouse
Yea get a ticket to the penthouse
