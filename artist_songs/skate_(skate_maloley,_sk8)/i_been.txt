Don't tell me I 'ont need it Imma be the judge of that
Let me get another cup of that
Let me get another puff of that
Cuz you know I'm all fuckin' straight love and that
So throw it I been turnin' up
Light another one I'm burnin' up
Listenin' to nobody tryna tell me what to do think I hearf enough
Cuz I been all up in my thoughts and I'm seizing the moment for one time in life
Balla on a budget I'm workin' so hard
Cuz I gotta stay Ron Paper Right
Sippin' a double cup I'm all alone but I'm feelin' like I'm in ma zone
I been so caught up in life that I don't even bother to answer my phone

Imma ride slow with the windows down I 'ont care I do anything I want
Life's so short so I gotta keep a right hand chick to do anything I want
I ain't talkin' bad on these hoes
Really they be runnin' this shit
This girl got a dick so hard that I might fuck around and just cum in this bitch
Wake up in the mornin' I be still honry
So I had to ask if I could hit it in the mornin'
Takin' off my Polo Ralph Lauren
Dark skin in the light look foreign
I been all up in ma thoughts and I don't
Really know what to do with this shit
Everybody want to fuck with me now
Cuz they see what I'm doin' it big
