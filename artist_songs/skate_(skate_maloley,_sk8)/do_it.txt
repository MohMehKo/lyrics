[Skate:]
I wake up to get my cake right
I stay up to work them late nights
Lord knows that I've been sinning
But I can't help the way I'm living
I do it for my squad
I do for the team
I do it for the ones that didn't want me to succeed
I do it for my squad
I do for the team
I do it for the ones that didn't want me to succeed

[50:]
I dab, swag
I been getting lots of cash
Fuck a bag
I don't ever check the tags
Brand new raft
Without the tag
Make the haters mad
She ain't fucking
Kick huh out the pad
Feels like I hit the lotto
Backwood full of hard-co
I be places that you can't go
Safe to state
I keep a bankroll
Bad bitches move when I say so
Number hunnids like a bank vault
I'm killing shit off like Adolf
Swag off the rectal scale
Mix and match
I do it very well
No fairy tales
I just pray my niggas wish me well
Just glad I'm here
Most niggas dead or in jail

I wake up
To get my cake right
Yeah
I stay up
To work the late night
Yeah
And lord knows
That I'm sinning
Yeah
But I can't help the way that I'm living
I do it for the squad
I do it for the team
I do it for the one's who didn't want me to succeed [x2]

[Skate:]
I do it for the fam
I do it for my pops
I do it for the young-ins out here grinding on the block
I do it for my city
I do it for my state
I do it everyday to keep the food up my plate

I was looking at the bank
And it was getting low
Hit my homie swazz
I tell em book a show
And we fly out to east
And we come back with racks
[?]
I'm shopping I'll call you back

All a that shit that you talk
It don't mean nothing at all
Walk in the building
And roll up a raw
Don't get involved
I am a problem you never can solve
[?]

Back on my pimping [x2]
I'm back on my pimping, shit
I'm fucking these women [x2]
I'm fucking these women, shit

I wake up to get my cake right (yeah)
I stay up to work the late night (yeah)
And lord knows that I been sinning (yeah)
But I can't help the way that I'm living
I do it for the squad
I do it for the team
I do it for the one's who didn't want me to succeed [x2]
