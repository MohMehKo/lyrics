[Skate:]
Like damn Daniel look at them Van's.
Pop a Xan while I do a damn dance.
I got J's on my feet,
If hip hop was a class I'm gettin' A's on the beat.

[Massey:]
Yeah, it's me and skate on the beat.
We walk up in the club throw a thousand a piece.
You ain't know nigga? I got a crib on the beach,
Fuck around leave a nigga head in the streets.

[Skate:]
Got that, yeah we got that
Bag full of weed in a Louis backpack.
Molly for the women 'cause I know they like that
Take another one and throw that ass right back.

[Massey:]
Throw that ass right back, ain't no telling where we going.
I pull up to show and I get bands for performing.
I pull up with some hoes and they all get it going.
I pull up with some hoes and kick 'em out in the morning.

[Skate:]
Jeans stay ripped, diamonds on the wrist,
Hundred dolla' tips, now that bih know I'm rich.
Money in the mattress, money on the shelves.
Shawty fell in love with a hundred dollar bill.

[Massey:]
How you ain't gon' fuck? Bitch I'm me,
I'm the God damn reason you in VIP.
CFO bitch it ain't nothing to me
Niggas say they getting money but they bluffing to me.

[Skate:]
We the new gen, Cal fucking it up
And if you ain't strapped yet, better buckle it up,
You know my hometown really fuck with' tough.
I gotta lot of homies tryna make it out of the rough.

[Massey:]
Made it out of the rough, when we ride to the top
And my paraphernalia up in my car is a lot
And I'm a fuck the DA lady in the fuckin twat
So I can get a lightened sentence on this DUI.

[Skate:]
Jeans stay ripped, diamonds on the wrist,
Hundred dolla' tips, now that bih know I'm rich.
Money in the mattress, money on the shelves.
Shawty fell in love with a hundred dollar bill.
