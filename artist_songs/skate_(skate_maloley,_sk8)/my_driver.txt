Run fast in a race though
I've been movin' at a slow pace though
Steady countin' pesos
I've been on my lay low
Homies on my payroll
Every meal I eat a appetizer chips and queso
Just picked up the bookies from the bay (from the bay)
Harvest club top shelf supreme quality
Don't act like you know
What the young boy takin' about
If you don't smoke good kush
Then we croppin' you out
I got butt on deck (on deck)
So light yt up motherfucker don't trip (don't trip)
Aye cuz bring the treat and we could roll another one up in a bleek (in a bleek)

Everything I do is raw like my papers (like my papers)
So high find me with the skyscraper (so high)
Back in school I was another trouble maker
Sippin' on the purp rockin' gold no laker (nah)
Got it butin' feelin' real tight bad bitch rollin' up
That's a real sight
How we headed to a movie at the starlight
After that take her to the crib hit it all might
When I wake in the mornin' take a quick piss
Rollin' up a quick splif light it with a flick bic
Then a take a quick pic with that lip bitch
Pass joint over to her hold on baby hit this
