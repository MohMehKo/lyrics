Too many outfits, too much swag

Coming through the crib you don't even know me
But damn baby, it's okay you can show me
You came through with your homie
And he'll be leaving here lonely
And I don't wanna front
But we with the team and we roll around and stunt

On a jet plane so I'm flyer than you, you
