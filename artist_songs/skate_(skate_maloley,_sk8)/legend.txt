Walk up in the club and I roll weed in my section
Hennessy whats popping is on the top it's impressive 
All my homies in here getting drunk we aggressive 
Pour me up a shot and then I toast to my blessings

Underpaid underrated
Bottles of the Chardonnay getting faded
Industry is telling lies and they all wrong
Told me that ahead of time I would've been on
Tryna smoke where the grass at (yeah, yeah)
Puff twice then I pass that (yeah, yeah)
Ziplocks in my backpack (yeah, yeah)
Setting trends like a hashtag (yeah, yeah)

If I ain't got it then you ain't got it and we ain't got it
It's in sighted I don't flight it's autopilot 
I hit my tattoo artist up on the phone 
And he gon' roll up to the crib and he gon' tat me some more 

Please don't worry bout the shit that we on
I'mma be a legend by the time that I'm gone
If I never make it then I guess it's my bad
But I'm motivated and I gotta get that (turn up, turn up)
