[Chorus:]
West coast, west coast, west coast
Headed to the west coast
It's the best coast baby
West coast, west coast, west coast
Headed to the west coast
Got the best smoke baby
[x2]

[Sammy:]
We in the west coast
Chillin' with the best folk
Smoking on the best smoke
But we are repping the big O
LA is where we are heading
And it's just the beginning
Give us some time to continue the time
At the blink of an eye
We are the veterans
Na it's much more than that
Taking shots we quarterbacking
Laid back before the tackling
Came in the game with a bat
Like a magnum
We started a new life
They don't believe us but despite that
We're gonna be waving down on a new flight
Above the ground, it's time to slow it (all the way down)
You say we should just give up
While we stacking up the thou's
Cause it's two Omaha, Nebraska white boys
And we moving out to LA so we can make some noise, man
That's unheard of, wait I take that back
Watch me yung Skate, my day one's, Jack & Jack
We gonna pave our own way, make a new style
We made a few bucks and we did it with a smile
(so cheese, so cheese, blow trees)

[Chorus x2]

[Skate:]
All these rappers stay affiliated to the west coast
So it's only fair that me and Sam pack our bag, homie let's go!
Sun say shining, the ocean stay blue
And the rumor was that the women look good, and they do (they do, they do)
I'm with the bay crew, out in California, independent, no label
I don't need it, no I don't need that
Cause I got my haters and my fans for feedback
It ain't common for a nineteen year old, entrepreneur
Making it out of the midwest, yeah we started from the sewer
And I'm tryna find all of the words that I need to finish and put in the song
So that all of my fans and can vibe out and dance
And sing the lyrics along
Going up to the top, next floor, next floor
And the question that I'm asking is how much the check for?
Cause I'm all about the money, no I ain't
I just like to stack a lot all inside my bank

[Chorus x2]

The west coast, got the best smoke
And I'm chillin' with the best folk
[x4]
