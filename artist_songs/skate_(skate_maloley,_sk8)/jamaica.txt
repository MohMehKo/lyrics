[Jack J:]
Girl you're the one I can't deny it
I had these crazy dreams of me and you flyin' private
Overseas hopin' that we don't crash and burn on the island
But if it happen
I wouldn't mind
Cuz you be by my side and yeah out phone's would be silent
Along with the lack of service 
We'd be surfin' with Poseidon
No lookin' at our screens
We look into each other's eyes and
That's just how it's supposed to be when you are young and so alive
And I just want to
Stay here with you
Stay here with you
You and your fragerance, perfume
We could live off the land like some caveman would do
We could just sing and dance while they playin' this tune
C'mon

[Chorus - Jack J:]
I just wanna take a trip to Jamaica
Hips move in unison 
Lips get a taste of one another
When we wake up in the covers
We'll be kissin' by the oceanside
[x2]

[Skate:]
I'm rollin' reefer with a baddle on the beach and i
I got the fire make you never wanna leave and i
I go to church on a Sunday 
I'm yellin' preach
Bowin' down on my knees and passin' it to the priest
There's a lot of things in life
I'm tryna figure out
And what's the reason 
All these cops are pullin' triggers now?
And what's the reason we can't even seem to keep the peace?
We take the government and then we put 'em in the streets
That's why I hit the herb just to ease the mind
And I hit the swerve when she need my time
But I'm right back up on the island
Forget about the bullshit 
I put it to the side then chill
Put it to the side then chill
I put it to the side then chill
To the side, to the side then chill
I put... put... put... put

[Chorus x2]

And I just wanna get away from the world
And I just wanna get away
Yeah I just wanna get away from the world
Cruise down the interstate
And I just wanna get away from the world
And I just wanna take away
Yeah I just wanna get away from the world
Cruise down the interstate

[Chorus]
