Late night conversations with my puff
He tellin' me to never stop
Ride round the neighborhood and hot box in my whip
Me and my hood, we be lit
They don't understand all the shit that I be on
Higher than a plane, catch me in my zone
I ain't hella good then I mix with all the bad
Flyin' through the clouds hopin' that I never land
Sometimes I be gettin' gone
You know, like drinkin' and smokin' and shit like that
I know I be in the wrong
Or at least I feel that way sometimes
Lately things been changin'
I like to think that every single day amazin'
But that ain't true
Some days blue, some days red
Some days you just hand your head
Some days you just toughen up
Some days you gon' be the best
Take a chance, let's take a pole
Let's take a Perc', we movin' slow
I'm off the shits, they know I'm lit
Yeah, I'm with this bitch, she sober-ish
We fuckin' at 1, we'll be done by 1:30
I would let you stay but tonight I'm in a hurry
Toppin' off the bottle, now my vision gettin' blurry
Speech a lil slurry, but I ain't never worry

Roll it up, light it up, take puff
Roll it up, light it up, take puff
Roll it up, light it up, take puff
Roll it up, light it up, take puff
Roll it up, light it up, take puff
Roll it up, light it up, take puff
