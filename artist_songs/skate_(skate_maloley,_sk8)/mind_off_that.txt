I pull up to Vegas, she say she from France
We get hella faded, let's do it again
Get your mind off that
Get your mind off that
Get your mind off that
Get your mind off that
Get your mind off that
Get your mind off that

I just took a bone real
And I laid this song quick
Took a Uber to the party
Calabasas, you know that I don't whip
I got the antidote
She stay in Mexico
I'm on the west coast
Pour up a bottle and let's toast
Pardon my set, pardon my bitch
I know she wild, she can get lit
I'm on the same level as her
Drop it down when I say that
Havin' sex in the Maybach
All the other bitches way whack
Takin' time just to say that

I pull up to Vegas, she say she from France
We get hella faded, let's do it again
Get your mind off that
Get your mind off that
Get your mind off that
Get your mind off that
Get your mind off that
Get your mind off that

Even when they hate me, I'ma stand my ground
I been smokin' daily, I been vibin' right now
I know I could get you in the back seat of my Benz
Ridin' round with all your friends, we get lit up off this Hen'

Might not, might stop
Might not make it, might not make it
But you know about the lifestyle
Might not make it, might not make it
But you know about the lifestyle
Might not make it, might not make it
But you know about the lifestyle
Might not make it, might not make it

I pull up to Vegas, she say she from France
We get hella faded, let's do it again
Get your mind off that
Get your mind off that
Get your mind off that
Get your mind off that
Get your mind off that
Get your mind off that

Lifestyle
Might not make it, might not make it
But you know about the lifestyle
Might not make it, might not make it
But you know about the lifestyle
Might not make it, might not make it
But you know about the lifestyle
Might not make it, might not make it
