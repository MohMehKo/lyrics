I fell in love, with this girl from the bay, happens to go by the name of Mary Jane,
man I think I fell in love, she makes my problems go away, she's so fine I might just hit it everyday, got no shame,
I'm in love, yeah, I'm in love, said I'm in love, yeah I'm in love. 

Oh god, I think I fell in love, young kid getting romantic with the bud,
yeah the rush she give me got me dancin' in the tub, nah I can't seem to get enough,
I met her way back as a freshmen in high school, peer pressure it's what all the cool guys do,
I felt like I was ready I knew it was time to meet her for the first time with the rest of my crew,
so we found a spot in the neighbourhood, in the woods, Sam's like "man this shit is crazy good",
when I hit it felt like I was jumpin' off an 80 foot buildin', but I wasn't goin' down I'm elevatin', look,
look around at the world so scenic, I rub my eyes man I must be dreamin',
love at first sight, no, I never quite believed it, man I mean it.

Leggo, 
J called up, said "hit in 16", so I hopped in the whip, and I roll another splif, and I hit in 16,
man I love my girl, everyday nice and tight, MJ, you got me all in my feelings when I hit it right,
I hit it right, everyday and every night, we never fight, that's what I like,
baby let's keep it that way, and I love it that you're wit me when I'm on the mic,
without you girl, I get lost, if it's bout you, I don't care what it costs,
we ain't get a zip, get a bag, I'mma lay you in a zag, you could smoke with a boss, you could smoke with a boss.
