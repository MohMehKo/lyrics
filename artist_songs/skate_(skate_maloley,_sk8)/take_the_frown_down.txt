You and me can never be the same, yeah

iPhone ringin' off the chain
Bottle of champagne up on the plane
You and me can never be the same
Ain't no way you a loser in the game

I'm drippin' this sauce, sauce, somebody come and get it
It's hot like a furnace and I'm the one that lit it
If I get in the lead then there ain't no catchin' up
I'm a different breed, that's a diamond in the rough

Did you really get what you came for?
Diamonds in the crib and the bankroll
I'm turnin' up for J, he my brother
Got a tattoo for him and my mother
And I gotta hit the gas when I'm in the ride, in the ride
Take a poor how I feel inside, feel inside
Hotel livin' life, we post a pic, post a pic
Smokin' Charlies like a [?]

I, I wouldn't take it for no
I wouldn't take it for no
I, I wouldn't take it for no
I wouldn't take it for no

I'm drippin' this sauce, sauce, somebody come and get it
It's hot like a furnace and I'm the one that lit it
If I get in the lead then there ain't no catchin' up
I'm a different breed, that's a diamond in the rough
I'm drippin' this sauce, sauce, somebody come and get it
It's hot like a furnace and I'm the one that lit it
If I get in the lead then there ain't no catchin' up
I'm a different breed, that's a diamond in the rough

I, I wouldn't take it for no
I wouldn't take it for no
I, I wouldn't take it for no
I wouldn't take it for no
