I've been gettin' high just to forget the lows
People come round me and beg for the dough
When they need money, they know where to go
The see me winnin', my pockets on fold
Went and bought a new car, new crib
Same swag with a new fitted
Never cared 'bout that school shit
I was out every night kickin' it with all the cool kids

On some cool shit, never thought I'd do shit
Doin' drugs and my mama wasn't cool with it
Papa could hit the stool shit, came up cruel shit
'Cause my crew lit, tripped and fell into a new hit
Ooh shit, I'm ruthless with the music
They clueless when they say I couldn't do this
You foolish, I been livin' in the booth, bitch
Now we take the elevator where the roof is where the views is
I did it on my own to be the man
I did it for the fam, got the city in my hand
Blue hunnids stretchin' out my rubber band, man
And lately I been stressin', so I hit the Xan, man, like

I've been gettin' high just to forget the lows
People come round me and beg for the dough
When they need money, they know where to go
The see me winnin', my pockets on fold
Went and bought a new car, new crib
Same swag with a new fitted
Never cared 'bout that school shit
I was out every night kickin' it with all the cool kids

Okay, we changed up, damn straight
Sorry for the wait, we been gettin' to the cake
I apologise in advance if you tryna hit my phone
I been workin' 'til like 6 up in the morn'
Gettin' down for my bitch, she up the sheets
She come to the crib, shawty know just what it is
Pull up to the Ritz, valet to assist
Smokin' up the sweet, everybody gettin' lit
We pull up like the dream team, my squad lit
Yeah, we be some green fiends, we all lit
I feel like it's my time now to get on
I gave my shawty hard dick that she can sit on
But it gon' never be enough
Where my homies that gon' ride when the times get tough?
Got my shorties in the Bay
Strip club gettin' bud, throwin' money on they ass
This the shit they ain't used to and won't get
My lifestyle so damn different than you kids
Never had a problem with bein' too real
Got more pride than a football field

I've been gettin' high just to forget the lows
People come round me and beg for the dough
When they need money, they know where to go
The see me winnin', my pockets on fold
New car, new crib
Same swag with a new fitted
Never cared 'bout that school shit
I was out every night kickin' it with all the cool kids
Cool kids, cool kids
Yeah, cool kids, yeah, the cool kids, yeah
I never cared 'bout that school shit
I was out every night kickin' it with all the cool kids
Cool kids, cool kids
Yeah, cool kids, yeah, the cool kids, yeah
I never cared 'bout that school shit
I was out every night kickin' it with all the cool kids
