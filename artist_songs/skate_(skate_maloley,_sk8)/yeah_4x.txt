Whole life I've been patient
But it's time to bring the noise up
I ain't even wanna say shit
But you know I end with the boys up
And you know when it goes up
Puster with toes up
Hoes fly when I pull up
'Cause I stay fresh from the toes up

Why you talking about a bitch, uh
We've been talking about a brat, uh
Stop thinking with your dick, uh
Start thinking with your head, uh
First time I got bread, uh
Put it back into the raps, uh
And I've never seen the laps, uh
Young boys spitting fast, uh

Every new day, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
New city new play, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ten down for the shows
Cristal for the hoes
Livin' life on the coast
Gettin' high for the lows
[2x]

Yeah the world is really so cold
But it's time to bring it back, uh
I've been sippin' on my solo
But the team is on attack, uh
People pressing for the promo
Ey but I want a rap, uh
I ain't never been a brat, uh
That's a shoutout to my dad, uh

Roll up the lighter, let's get in the flow
I'm from the o, do wanted mo
We bout' to blow, taking it slow
We wanted bronze, here for the gold
Gotta make sure that we're doing it right
Ain't no telling what we're doing tonight
I'm a just mix a little rupp with the spite
That's been a lie, bitch a good type

I'm faded, thought a little bit jaded
Whole life I've been waiting, please don't call me when I made it
And I'm like, wow, it's time I work hard and get mine
I play smart, don't shine and if my fam good than I'm fine

Everyday new day, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
New city new play, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ten down for the shows
Cristal for the hoes
Livin' life on the coast
Gettin' high for the lows
[4x]
