I'm on the road, 
I'm at a show,
I'm getting turnt up,
You already know,
It's about to go down,
It's about to go down,
It's about to go down,  
It's about to go down,
It's about to go down,
It's about to go down, 

Look, 
When I'm on the road I got options,
Hit the bong and I'm coughin',
Better recognize I'm not stoppin',
I was a colonel,
Now I'm straight poppin',
We out west one, we in the guest son,
We on the guest list and no stress son,
But now I'm flexin' in this bitch
Me and my team, my boys are my clique
New boy, new style,
Gettin' buckwild,
Do it for awhile,

Do a little dance,
Saggin' my pants,
Rappin' like chance,
Do it with a smile,
Long Tee with a dogs and a snapback,
And a lot of women hit me on my snapchat,
Late night studio sessions, 
Man I'm a lab rat,

Hear about my life and I ask can I have that,
Can I have that life,
Can I have them benz,
Can I have dem friends,
Can I have that sight,
Can I have dem fans,
Can I have that chance,
To make it all right,

Right now I'm tryna have some fun,
Work hard til' the day is done,
And even though it seems big right now,
Shit just begun,

I'm on the road, 
I'm at a show,
I'm getting turnt up,
You already know,
It's about to go down,
It's about to go down,
It's about to go down,  
It's about to go down,
It's about to go down,
It's about to go down, 

Stayin' up, but it's goin' down,
Got trees on deck,
Enough to go around,
Never use to fuck with me,
Now they realizin' that a young boy straight throwin' now,
I got swag,
I'm lookin' like a million bucks,
'Member when they wasn't feelin' us,

But, I don't even care about it,
Ain't nobody really care about it,
Right now let's turn up,
Roll another one, Burn up
And I ain't givin' up,
Until everyone around here heard us,

Now what is ya doin'?
On a rule straight coolin',
We dem boys in the LA streets,
Messin' around with them straight foolin'
Let me tell you 'bout a real one,
It all depends how you feelin'
So turnt up and I'm never comin' down,
Higher 'den the ceilin'
Right now I'm just tryna get away from soba,
Imma holla at 'chu when the party's over,

I'm on the road, 
I'm at a show,
I'm getting turnt up,
You already know,
It's about to go down,
It's about to go down,
It's about to go down,  
It's about to go down,
It's about to go down,
It's about to go down,
