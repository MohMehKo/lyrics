I got a lot of proof
I got a lot of weed
I got a lot of drink in my cup
I got a lot of bad bitches that love to suck dick for a man while I'm rolling up
Kush in my lungs, and security wanna pop off when I go and sell out a show
I'm gonna make sure that I let 'em know
Gotta make sure that I let 'em know
No discussion I'm the man
Come to your city and run up these bands
Come to your city and fuck up these commas
That minimum wage that you got all from my fans
Never stressing cause I love my job
Pussy bitches on the menopause
It's the greatest thing I've ever got
Middle finger to the Webster Hall
I just came here to party, shit
I just came here to dance, shit
I just came here to turn up but
Then all of that changed when I see you pushing on a fan
I remember pushing weight
I remember all the hate
I remember every single person
Trying to tell me nothing was the same shit
But I got my money up, uh
Then I lost it all again, shit
Taking chances and lose it all
Came back 100% and I win
Win for my family
I win for my brothers
I win to put money in all they pockets
We never stopping, that money be talking
The time that we clocking they finding it shocking
Overpowered by the throne
They been hacking all the phones
I'm here to tell what's wrong
I'm here to tell you the system is wrong, (what?)
I'm here to educate
I'm here to medicate, I'm here to celebrate
I'm here to tell you the truth and
Nothing but the truth so I guess what I better say
I better say it's hard to lose (yeah)
I better say I'm with my crew (true)
I better show and then improve
I better go and make a move
I better tell 'em that I'm old
I better tell 'em that I'm gone
I bet I'm smoking on that strong
I bet you listened to this song
It's my year, it's my year
I got a lot to say
It's my year, it's my year
I gotta lot to say
It's my year, it's my year
I got a lot to say
It's my year, it's my year
I got a lot to say
