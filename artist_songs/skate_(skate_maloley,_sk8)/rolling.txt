Look...
What it is what it be
To the O to the G
Lot of people looking up to me
But they older then me
Lot of women on their bullshit
And they know what it mean
Ima take a bad bitch to the crib
Hit it all damn night and she know when to leave
But I gotta get back to the basics
Lot of people got a dream don't chance it
Lot of people work don't make it
Given up no patience

Not a lotta time
I been on my grind
Do it for the money, while they do it for the vine
I just wanna shine
Prove it to the people I can rhyme
Gotta put it all over the line

I'm rollin' thou'
Got me out here rollin' thou'
I'm riding for my family like there's no tomorrow
I'm rollin' thou'
Got me out here rollin' thou'
I'm riding for my family that shits protocol

We rolling thou' [x2]
It's a party and my homies and we going thou
We going thou
We rolling thou
My team got the juice and we ain't showin' off

[Derek Luh:]
Just a life in a day
From the East to The Bay
Got a J in my face
Roll it all in my waist

Show it down and speed it up
Hold it down, till we eaten bruh
Makin' moves and [?]
Sippin' and smokin that purple
Actin like I ain't at work hoe

My shit bang no kurt co
If there's a problem we all rollin' up
My skin tone gone throw them off

You say you ain't a pussy but we know it cuz
