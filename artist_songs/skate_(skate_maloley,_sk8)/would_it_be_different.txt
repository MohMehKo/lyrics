Later tonight I'll roll a smith and get high
Mix in the drugs with a sprite
My mama right I can't take care of myself but you know that I'm missing your smile
Missing the crib missing the fam never forget
You my number one fan
What is a fan?
This is reality man
Tripping all trills in the sand
I'm just a man
Born in this world
Brought up on nothing but diamonds & pearls
Two on the wrist one on your bitch
Rappers all in the booth talking 'bout this
Talking 'bout nothing important
Who is reporting?
All the TV channels saying that shit affortion
Who is reporting?
When I'm recording

Would it be different
If I wasn't pimping
If I was a regular dude getting bitches
No more permissions
No more intentions
I will just roll, go to the show
Turn up with all of my bros and
You know, you know how it go
You know that we smoke

Would it be different?
If I wasn't famous
If I wasn't famous, would it be different
If I ain't get payments
If I ain't get payments, would it be different
Would it be different?
Would it be different?
Would it be different?
Would it be different?

If I wasn't famous
If I wasn't famous, would it be different
If I ain't get payments
If I ain't get payments would it be different
Would it be different?
Would it be different?
Would it be different?
Would it be different?

Gotta stay up 
Gotta stay up
Gotta stay up
I gotta stay fly
I gotta stay fly
They watching my every move I don't know why?
I guess I know why
Cuz they think I'm famous, I think they brainless
No superhero, you know I ain't painless
That's why I made this
Tell all these people that nothing is something and something is nothing it all even outs in the end 
You can't be something if you wasn't something before the time you was all in
Would it be different?
If I hadn't wrote all my goals on a paper the young kid was planning a mission 
Would it be different 
If I was broke
If I ain't rap
If all these bitches I said that were bad
Were nothing but trash
Would you be mad or would you be glad
Or would you be glad?
Cuz I couldn't couldn't tell
I knew that from the start you couldn't help it
You couldn't help it

Would it be different?
If I wasn't famous
If I wasn't famous would it be different
If I ain't get payments
If I ain't get payments, would it be different
Would it be different?
Would it be different?
Would it be different?
Would it be different?

If I wasn't famous
If I wasn't famous, would it be different
If I ain't get payments
If I ain't get payments would it be different
Would it be different?
Would it be different?
Would it be different?
