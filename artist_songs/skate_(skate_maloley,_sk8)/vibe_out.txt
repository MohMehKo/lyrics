Never do too much,
I ain't got time for the BS,
Honestly I got a lot of family, and friends, and I'm happy that we all get to see this,
Young boy, and I'm coming in harder than a lot of other rappers in the game right now, (it's true)
Haven't blown up yet, so we can start it off with a bang right now, (bang, bang)
Living on my own, I miss mama,
I don't date girls, that's drama,
But I guess I can always make an exception, so holla at me, Yovanna,
Goddamn, you so fine, (so fine)
But I probably won't pay no mind, (no, no)
I'm a little bit tipsy, but I turn up like Lindsay Lohan, (Lindsay Lohan)
And this my life, I just vibe out, (vibe out)
But I pray everyday, I'm blessed, (everyday I'm blessed)
2015, double xo, Freshlee,
We'll just say I'm next,

Kick back, roll that, you know that, we vibe out [x2]
You know that, we vibe out [x4]
Kick back, roll that, you know that, we vibe out [x2]
You know that, we vibe out [x4]

We ride by, we roll up, we ride out, it's,
Time to stop wasting our time like the time's out, and do our own thing,
Running LA like we supposed to,
You know we rose to this new life, so we gon' take advantage and cruise by,
With the windows on my eyes following close behind (close behind),
The time divide by roll up and just catch a hike (catch a hike),
Stop playing these games, you need to learn to get it done,
So sit down back and take a sip, or take a seat and do like us we,

Kick back, roll that, you know that, we vibe out [x2]
You know that, we vibe out [x4]
Kick back, roll that, you know that, we vibe out [x2]
You know that, we vibe out [x4]

Kick back, roll that, (roll that, roll that), roll that, vibe out, (vibe out, vibe out) [x4]
Kick back, roll that, roll that, vibe out [x4]
Vibe out [x10]
