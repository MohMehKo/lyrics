Yeah,
I been on the road for too long
She been with her friends while I'm gone
They tellin' her lies about me
To make sure she despise everything around me
I been gettin' bread on my own
She lives on the west
Well I don't
Beggin' me to move where she at
All the good I do but you never see that

We sip a bottle and leave no regrets
Body like models, she knows what is next
We keep our relationship on the low
Outta Town Pussy, I get on the road
She my...

Outta Town Pussy for real
She comin' thru in a Lyft
Already lit off a pill
That's how I feel
Now that we home, we all alone
We get it on, silhouette's strong
We on the strong, til 6 in the morn
Finally we faded, feelin' amazing
I get to blazin', she entertaining
Shawty been waiting, ain't no debating
We get it on, we get it on
I should've know
Distance was long
Xan got me gone
Don't answer my phone

We sip a bottle and leave no regrets
Body like models, she knows what is next
We keep our relationship on the low
Outta Town Pussy, I get on the road
She my...
