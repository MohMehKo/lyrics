I still think about you when I am all alone
Takin' trips out of the country and flying back home
I say girl
Where have you been?
(Where have you been?)
Are you fuckin' with that nigga or is he just a friend?
I say girl
Where have you been?
(Where have you been?)
I can admit I made sure you was a perfect 10
You went to Vegas again
What happened?
Tought you were sick of niggas
that be claimin' they ballin' they rappin'
Girl
We didn't fuck enough
We didn't love enough
Something's up
Hold up, we both need the other still
Then made the summer tough
Seein' you in the club
Made me say 'fuck the club'
Along with other stuff
You was there when I would bag it up
Double up
Then I would bring it back
I was the king of that puss
(Damn)
I wish we could leave out this section
And slide to my truck
Cause sometimes I just reminisce about all of the

Girls
That I used to fuck
(That I used to fuck)
You light up my world
I ain't thank you enough
(I ain't thank you enough)
Talki' 'bout
Girls
That I used to fuck
(That I used to fuck)
So sorry that you fell in love
But I had to do other stuff
(do other stuff)
Girls
That I used to fuck
(That I used to fuck)
You light up my world
I ain't thank you enough
(I ain't thank you enough)
Talki' 'bout
Girls
That I used to fuck
(That I used to fuck)
So sorry that you fell in love
But I had to do other stuff

(do other stuff)

Girl I ain't playin', it's real
Everything that we had, that was for real
Why you been closin', I take of your meals
Had me caught up, I was feelin' so ill
Stop
I didn't need ya
You saw it comin' but really I didn't think that I would leave ya
Back and forth arguin'
It was so botherin' I couldn't keep ya
What was your worth?
Was it this verse?
Right now I'm feelin' no pain
So I don't know what hurts
What was your worth?
What is your role on this earth?
We didn't fuck enough
We didn't fuck enough
I didn't bust enough
I didn't talk about us enough
I never love enough
I swear that I never love enough
You could just ride with me
Take your time with me
Wake up in the mornin' get high with me
(high)
Take you to all of them beaches
Pull up a lil' somethin' and we could get islandy
What was your worth?
(What was your worth?)
Was it this verse?

Last one might end up to first
End up to first

Girls
That I used to fuck with

You light up my world
I ain't thank you enough

So sorry that you fell in love,
But i had to do other stuff
