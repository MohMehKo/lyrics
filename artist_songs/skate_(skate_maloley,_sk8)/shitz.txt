They really tryna catch up
Just gon' keep doin' this

Livin' the life, livin' the life, feelin' the vibe
Feelin' the vibe, feelin' the vibe, livin' the life
Livin' the life, livin' the life, feelin' the vibe
Feelin' the vibe, feelin' the vibe, livin' the life

Naked bitches in my hotel
Rollin' weed on a roll tray
People think they know me so well
Got me up at the party
Blowin' the bag, run up a tag
Buy me some denim to sag
I got the swag, some may lack
Put my city on the map
We time independent
We time independent, yeah, I been sinnin'
But I been winnin', ice on my pendant
Windows stay tinted
We on top, be alive
And the mean turn to alibi
Mama told me never tell a lie
Every single day I pray to God

When I come around, she be down with the shitz
We gon' smoke a pound, she be down with the shitz
If I'm in her town, she be down with the shitz
Down with the shitz, down, down with the shitz
When I come around, she be down with the shitz
We gon' smoke a pound, she be down with the shitz
If I'm in her town, she be down with the shitz
Down with the shitz, down, down with the shitz

If she down, we gon' take her to the hotel
Gon' pop a bottle, baby, this somethin' you don't tell
I'm fresh as hell, I get to fuckin' with my ice on
You know we listenin' to my song
I roll one up, I think she down with it
She take that ass and toss around with it
We hit the club up on the Tuesday
My camera man gon' make a movie
Take a pic with your bitch
She a fan, it's okay
Lot of young girls fuck with Sk8
Don't ever let it get in the way
I might just go out and make a play
I don't never fuckin' hesitate
And I'm drinkin' all the Hennessy
Young boss what they tellin' me

Livin' the life, livin' the life, feelin' the vibe
Feelin' the vibe, feelin' the vibe, livin' the life
Livin' the life, livin' the life, feelin' the vibe
Feelin' the vibe, feelin' the vibe, livin' the life

When I come around, she be down with the shitz
We gon' smoke a pound, she be down with the shitz
If I'm in her town, she be down with the shitz
Down with the shitz, down, down with the shitz
When I come around, she be down with the shitz
We gon' smoke a pound, she be down with the shitz
If I'm in her town, she be down with the shitz
Down with the shitz, down, down with the shitz
