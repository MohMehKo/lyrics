I bring out the weed and she gon' roll a blunt
We been kickin' shit just like a fuckin' punt
Drugs and alcohol, we like to have some fun
Money on my mind and I can't get enough
Drugs and alcohol, we like to have some fun
Money on my mind and I can't get enough
Drugs and alcohol, we like to have some fun
Money on my mind and I can't get enough

I'm faded, I'm focused and faded
I pray that I make it, I'm whippin' Mercedes
Come fuck with the greatest
I hop out the latest
Pour up a fifth and take me a sip
As a youngin' I knew I had a gift
So I'm finna rep and count up a grip
Yeah, spendin' money just to make it back
Run a bill up like a fuckin' track
Cameras on me, I don't even Act'
'Less it's purple stuff and I'ma take it back
Take it back and I'll be hella gone
She got a friend, bring another one
Litty, I'm litty, the kettle won
Got a vibe, you can come and get up on it
I'm on a vibe, I'm on a vibe, we gettin' high
Feelin' alive, hands in the sky, wave 'em around, yeah
I'm on a vibe, I'm on a vibe, we gettin' high
Feelin' alive, hands in the sky, wave 'em around, yeah

I bring out the weed and she gon' roll a blunt
We been kickin' shit just like a fuckin' punt
Drugs and alcohol, we like to have some fun
Money on my mind and I can't get enough
Drugs and alcohol, we like to have some fun
Money on my mind and I can't get enough
Drugs and alcohol, we like to have some fun
Money on my mind and I can't get enough

Like a DM, I'ma slide in
That pussy wetter than Dacadi
She lookin' bad when she ride it
Gettin' that chick excited
Gettin' money like a ransom
Go and make another anthem
Doin' doughnuts in the Phantom
Fake bitches, can't stand 'em
Them fake bitches, can't stand 'em
Tell 'em miss me with the bullshit
I play my cards on folded
Bitch, I'm like denim loaded
Them fake bitches, can't stand 'em
If you a freak, better show it
See you lyin' and I know it
Come and fuck with a poet

I bring out the weed and she gon' roll a blunt
We been kickin' shit just like a fuckin' punt
Drugs and alcohol, we like to have some fun
Money on my mind and I can't get enough
Drugs and alcohol, we like to have some fun
Money on my mind and I can't get enough
Drugs and alcohol, we like to have some fun
Money on my mind and I can't get enough
