(Yo, yo I'm in the booth right now let me call you back
ooohhh god damn yeah, god damn yeah, uh)

All the hatin' homie
I don't care about it
I keep my headphones in 
So I don't hear about it 
Always movin' to the top,
I'm a tree climber 
I used to beg for twenty dollars 
cryin' "please momma"
I need a little bit of cash
got a date momma
Cuz when she ask me for the check 
what I'm gon' say momma?
Do I tell 'er that I'm unemployed?
or do I tell 'er that I'm makin' music for the joy?
cuz ain't no woman want a man without a plan 
That's exactly what I was but they didn't understand
I don't think they saw the vision
Blessings I was given
Life turned 3-6-0,
Love the way I'm livin'
Let's get it, yeah

Pour up, let's toast
To what we love the most
This life, is exactly what I dreamed 
So I had to go and get it with my team
So fresh, this life 
So clean, this life
So fresh, this life
So clean, this life
So fresh, this life
So clean, this life
So fresh, this life
So clean, this life

So fresh
Breathe in, breathe out
No reason to freak out
I calm myself I'm chillin'
Tellin' myself I don't need help, nah 
Yeah I can do this on my own, no problem, true
I'm workin' hard and burnin' like a roster
WHO is gonna tell me otherwise
and day I had to choose
If I would go to school 
or if my dreams would get pursued
and trust me that decision's hard to make
but when I thought about it 
really what's my life without a risk or two?
I'm tryna be the greatest of this generation
I put in work no way I'll do this without dedication
I used to have a dream but I replaced it 
with one that's twice as big and twice as crazy 
now I chased it 
I'm out, yeah

Pour up, let's toast
To what we love the most
This life, is exactly what I dreamed 
So I had to go and get it with my team
So fresh, this life 
So clean, this life
So fresh, this life
So clean, this life
So fresh, this life
So clean, this life
So fresh, this life
So clean
