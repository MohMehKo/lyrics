Oh my God we on
On another level I ain't thin we'd ever be on (uh)

Yeah, you motherfuckin' right if I said I ain't with you tonight
Puttin' hours in the studio I'm rippin' the mic
No time for the bullshit I'm holdin' it down
Cuz you'll me all over my dick when I'm holdin' the crown
Got my eyes on the prize it ain't hard to tell
If you not great son bet your father will
and I ain't cuff no chicks cuz it ain't my scene
You're fallin' short with these hoes like promethazine
Don't think about it only time will tell
Never check the inbox gotta lot of mail
I don't like to read shit but we list some more
And if you need a little drank we can get some more
I thank God firts
Thank God this
You the only reason I be droppin' this (drop)
Pour another cup we can cheers to that
Hit a punchline 100 let me hear that back
Look

On my God we on
On another level I ain't think we'd ever be on
Got me like oh my God it's true (I'll tell you it's true)
On another level I'ont think you'll ever got to
Cuz I'm on another level
On a whole 'nother level (we on a whole 'nother level)
Cuz I'm on another level
On a whole 'nother level (we on a whole 'nother level)
Got me like oh my God it's true (I'll tell you it's true)
On another level I'ont think you'll ever get to

Look
Look too turnt (too turnt)
Good Lord (good Lord)
I need to light up a bit more
I'm gone (I'm gone)
What's new? (what's new?)
Don't be anybody that's not you
But uh, think 'bout how my life it changed
Fan base with the life it came
Had a break thought and I pray for that
And got a little buzz and I'm takin' that
Got some levels to this shit I'm on one
And I hope I'm at the top when it's all done
Hollywood blud you could see me there
When I'm in Omaha you can come and get your cd there
I'm a white boy with a dope style (with a dope style)
Rollin' blunts in the so-cal
Got the kush call blowin' kush smoke
When I leave the scene they askin' 'where the kush go?'

On my God we on
