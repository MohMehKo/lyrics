Man I gotta get it
there ain't no selling 
I'm putting no limits
I gotta make sure they never forget it
They fucking with it 
so Ima be home in a minute 
I'm in LA and I'm stackingy my pages
down in Miami I'm pulling them bitches 
that is the business
I'm branding my image
So I can go out and just make me a living 
Make me a living to take care of the fam 
make me a living to feel like the man
Make me a living so I can go off to the party
and they double take cause the know who I am

Ima roll one maybe two
take your clothes off
We can do anything we wanna do
We, we can do anything we wanna do
We, we can do anything we wanna do
We, we can do anything we wanna do
We, we can do anything we wanna do

Faz down looking swaz down 
we be in the pad now
take another dab now
then we hit the lap down
that's the way I've been living
I ain't ask for it 
all this should've been given

Bless to the fam
bless to the people who been rocking with the man
bless to the weed
that shit get me high
bless to the girl on her knees getting tried
blessin on blessin on blessin I'm counting them up and I'm learning my lesson
I'm proving them wrong
and I never be flexing
I'm making the course but I'm not in the refining sometimes I

Maybe I just wanna ride round down town gone gone get a room at the W

We, we can do anything you wanna do 
We, we can do anything you wanna do

Maybe I just wanna ride round down town gone gone get a room at the W
