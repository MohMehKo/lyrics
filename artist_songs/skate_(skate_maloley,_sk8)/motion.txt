On this 2017 shit

Roll me up some dang, roll me up some dang
Put it into motion, put it into motion
Roll me up some dang, roll me up some dang
Put it into motion, put it into motion
I just buy the bottle, let's get fuckin' lit
Put it into motion, put it into motion
We skrrt off the lot up in a foreign whip
Put it into motion, put it into motion
Put it into motion, put it into motion
Backwoods, better roll it, backwoods, better roll it
Go and catch a vibe, go and catch a vibe
Put it into motion, put it into motion
I reup, S reup, S reup, S reup
I reup, S reup, S reup, S reup

Okay, put that turnup in the blunt
Mama told me you look like your daddy's son
Let's gon' kill some bottles, let's gon' kill some bottles
Let's fuck on some models, let's fuck on some models
Let's go get a bag, let's go get a bag
Let's go run it up, let's go make it back
I'ma be the leader, yeah, the one you follow
Spin it like a vinyl, put that in throttle
Yeah, okay, black ain't my skin tone
Real stone like the Flintstones
And we fuckin' right when she get home
'Cause I love that, love that bitch

Roll me up some dang, roll me up some dang
Put it into motion, put it into motion
Roll me up some dang, roll me up some dang
Put it into motion, put it into motion
I just buy the bottle, let's get fuckin' lit
Put it into motion, put it into motion
We skrrt off the lot up in a foreign whip
Put it into motion, put it into motion
Put it into motion, put it into motion
Backwoods, better roll it, backwoods, better roll it
Go and catch a vibe, go and catch a vibe
Put it into motion, put it into motion
