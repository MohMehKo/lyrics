Uh
This the realest shit I ever wrote
Nah I'm playin' but my eyes are getting hella low
I've been smokin' hella dope
Life has been incredible
Travelin' around the country doin' things unforgettable
When it comes down to it, shit I'm still a kid
Younger brother, older sister I was just the middle kid
The middle child
But I had a little style
My friends told me I had something special so I spit a while
Spit a couple verses for my fans
Spit a couple verses for my fam
Spit a couple verses for the ones that knew for certain that if I continue workin' the dream would become a plan
Never seems real 'til it hits home
And I been on the road so I been gone
I remember comin' home from school and gettin' lifted
While I searched the internet for any beats that I could spit on

I don't know what's happenin'
I don't know what's wrong
All I know is nothing's promised and one day it could all be gone
While I'm here I wanna live my life for what it's worth
Some days good and some days bad
Cuz that's just how it is on earth so
A little bit of sunshine
Little bit of rain (yeah)
A little bit of sunshine
Little bit of rain (yeah)
Little bit of sunshine
Little bit of rain
Little bit of sunshine
Little bit of rain

Look, hop in my car and head to work
Feel like I'm fallin' head first
Into the ocean, man
Some days I don't wanna fuckin' go again
Cuz work, man I can't do it
There was somethin' special out there for me and I knew it
I didn't wanna be the same as everyone
So I thought it was me that savin' everyone
But that's too much pressure on a young boy
Can't do it myself so I rallied up a convoy
We know two's better than one person
But two don't work if actually one's hurtin'
See reality
Took away our mentality
Tried to show us morality
All they brought was brutality
And that's the reason why we still sittin' right here
Searchin' for the answer but it's never gettin' here
Keep the peace

I don't know what's happenin'
I don't know what's wrong
All I know is nothing's promised and one day it could all be gone
While I'm here I wanna live my life for what it's worth
Some days good and some days bad
Cuz that's just how it is on earth so
A little bit of sunshine
Little bit of rain (yeah)
A little bit of sunshine
Little bit of rain (yeah)
Little bit of sunshine
Little bit of rain
Little bit of sunshine
Little bit of rain
