Things are changin'
Out in Cali and I'm entertainin'
Smokin' weed like it's my occupation
And we higher than the population

I'm from the mid, that's middle west
I'm sacrificin' all my time, had to invest
I take a trip up to the Hills to smoke and chill
I'm workin' my way to the top, shit, that's how I feel
Yeah, okay, I remember when my pockets low
Senor J's, I ain't coppin' no
Whole life had to [?]
Now you see me postin' livin' tropical
I got my own swag, got my own team
I got this lil bitch from the OC
Know we smokin' on the OG
Yeah, this charged up like I'm morphine

Things are changin'
Out in Cali and I'm entertainin'
Smokin' weed like it's my occupation
And we higher than the population

I really am, I really am on the road
I really am, I really am gettin' hoes
I really am, I really am with the shits
I really am, I really am gettin' rich

Things are changin'
Out in Cali and I'm entertainin'
Smokin' weed like it's my occupation
And we higher than the population

And they ain't recognisin' the work
Been on, I been on, yeah
This rappin' shit, I got on it first
Been on, I been on, yeah
See I been up, I been down
Causin' trouble in your town
Like 30 rounds
Drippin', drippin' and you see where the money at
I been gamblin' all the time, I'ma love you yet
And we take 1 shot, 2 shot, 3 shot and 4
Got a best friend with a Rolex and another one with the fro
Yeah, we roll up, it's smoke thing everywhere that we go
Everywhere we go, yeah, we be settin' the tone

Things are changin'
Out in Cali and I'm entertainin'
Smokin' weed like it's my occupation
And we higher than the population

I really am, I really am on the road
I really am, I really am gettin' hoes
I really am, I really am with the shits
I really am, I really am gettin' rich

Things are changin'
Out in Cali and I'm entertainin'
Smokin' weed like it's my occupation
And we higher than the population
