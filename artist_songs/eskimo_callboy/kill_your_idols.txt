Sometimes I feel like nobody cares, 
when I’m sitting alone on the hallway stairs. 
I need a friend, a love, a life to fit in. 
But I am to weak to get out of my skin. 

I was down on my knees and I never felt release 
from the pain that is hiding so deep inside. 
I have fought my heart, so full of delusion. 
But now I see it clearly right in front of my eyes. 

Woohooho, you’re not alone. 
Kill your idols! 
Together we are standing strong. 
Woohooho, we’re not alone. 
Kill your idols! 
Together we are strong. 

Tonight we’re breaking down these walls.
Though you never believed us. 
Tonight we learn to live again 
and we never let you down. 

I will never back down, now it’s my time to sin. 
I’ll make you eat the dirt that you put me in. 
I was a coward to not stand up for myself. 
I got a beaten in the face first when I was twelve. 

And now I have more than I ever had before 
‘cause I Just stand up and I make it mine. 
The fear of always being rejected 
turned out to be just a ghost in my head. 

Woohooho, you’re not alone. 
Kill your idols! 
Together we are standing strong. 
Woohooho, we’re not alone. 
Kill your idols! 
Together we are strong. 

Tonight we’re breaking down these walls.
Though you never believed us. 
Tonight we learn to live again 
and we never let you down. 

I’m not a fucking misfit in your perfect world. 
I just wanna break out as long as I can. 
I wanna break out, ou never let me in. 
I’ll never back down on the way to myself. 
Never back down, just let met go. 

I wanna be part of the fun. 
I got 99 talents but you ain’t see one. 
I need a chance to show you what I’ve got. 
I just wanna be me cause I’ll die if I’m not.

Woohooho, you’re not alone. 
Kill your idols! 
Together we are standing strong. 
Woohooho, we’re not alone. 
Kill your idols! 
Together we are strong. 

Tonight we’re breaking down these walls.
Though you never believed us. 
Tonight we learn to live again 
and we never let you down.
