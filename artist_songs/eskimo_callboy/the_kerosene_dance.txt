I tell you a story
I swear it is true
I never met a girl
I despise more than you
day by day it is hard to handle
this fucking mess inside my head
a dance on the edge of the heart
so ugly
so starved
and if this curtain falls
you’ll be nothing more than a fuck
I’ve given up and always too much
what you’ve given to me?
nothing less than a touch
you try to drag me down
but I’m so much stronger today
you’re goddamn worthless
like…
the cig’s in your ashtray
do you remember?
I’ve given up myself
don’t want to feel this way again
fuck you whore
say goodbye
do you remember?
my world turns into a lie
don’t want to feel this way again
fuck you whore
say goodbye
with every step you changed your face
your greatest pleasure was
my moments of disgrace
the hell with you
you mentally retarded whore
I’ve tried my best again and again
always cursed the moment
where it began
so many times you made me feel
that I’ve been the mistake in your life
thank you for nothing
for all your lies
you try to drag me down
but I’m so much stronger today
you’re goddamn worthless
like..
the cig’s in your ashtray
do you remember?
I’ve given up myself
don’t want to feel this way again
fuck you whore
say goodbye
do you remember?
my world turns into a lie
don’t want to feel this way again
fuck you whore
say goodbye
fuck you whore, you’re nothing to adore!
fuck you whore, you’re nothing to adore!
and if this curtain falls
you will be nothing but a…
and if this curtain falls
you will be nothing but a…
FUCK!
