Good times on polaroids
sleepless the nights
moments gone with a smile
turn from pale into white
and it turns around in my head
a movie scene of feelings we’ve had
don’t forget me
and don’t forget us
when I say goodbye
waving till you’re gone
wishing this moment could last
forever
when I say goodbye
for the last time
thinking of you and me
forever
and since you’ve been gone
the memories so breakable
they don’t let me forget
feelings are a gift
but always untouchable
and it turns around in my head
a movie scene of feelings we’ve had
don’t forget me
and don’t forget us
when I say goodbye
waving till you’re gone
wishing this moment could last
forever
when I say goodbye
for the last time
thinking of you and me
forever
take my hand
I try to catch these moments
that dash along so fast
I hold these folded hands
they’re praying for the past
I try to catch these moments
that dash along so fast
I hold these folded hands
they’re praying for the past
And I try to catch these moments
that dash along so fast
I can’t even figure out
whats happening to me
and now it’s only you
the memory in me
