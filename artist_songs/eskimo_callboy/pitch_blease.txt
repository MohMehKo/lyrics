I call my homies, call my hoes, 
‘cause that’s the only way it goes. 
I know that party’s gonna be just fine. 
I’m coming! 
Tonight we’re dancing to the beat, 
I move my hips for you. 
So baby can you feel the heat? 
Let’s do it one more time. 

We’re getting fucking hammered,
we’re getting fucking drunk! 
Tonight we’re gonna party, 
tonight I’ll spread my spunk. [x2]

Have you seen the girl that rocks to the beat? 
Everything she’s got is all that I need. 
Have you seen the girl that rocks to the beat? 
Party all night long! Party all night long! 

And that’s the way it goes, you are all that I need. 
My party overdose, all night long. [x2]

Let’s party, get naughty! 
So baby rock your body! 
Let’s party, get naughty! 
And that’s the way it goes. [x2]

So raise your middle fingers up 
to show that we don’t give a fuck. 
And all the single ladies wait in line. 
I’m cumming! 
I share the liquor with my friends, 
I know this party never ends. 
And all my people scream out loud. 

‘Cause now it’s time to break the rules. 
Now it’s time to break the rules. 
Just hit it! 

And that’s the way it goes. 
And that’s the way it goes. 

Have you seen the girl that rocks to the beat? 
Everything she’s got is all that I need. 
Have you seen the girl that rocks to the beat? 
Party all night long, party all night long. 

And that’s the way it goes, you are all that I need. 
My party overdose, all night long. [x2]

Let’s party, get naughty! 
So baby rock your body! 
Let’s party, get naughty! 
And that’s the way it goes. [x2]

You are all that I need, you’re all that I need. 
I wanna confess myself tonight. 
You are all that I need, you’re all that I need 
Until the end of the night. 

Look me in the eyes while I rip you apart. 
I need a hole from your cunt to your heart.
