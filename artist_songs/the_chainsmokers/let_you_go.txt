You end up alone, after all that you've done
All that you've paid for
Did you get what you wanted?
You loaded a gun with all you were made of
When you're alone,
People don't think you know what you're made of, oh

Are you better than me?
It's not up to say, it's all that you wait for
Now I'll find a way, I'm seeing it through can you not be hateful.
While we're alive, can we relax, isn't that what are mates for?

You were there for me
And I was there for you
How will I let you go?
You will always be the one
That I regret
How will I let you go?

You're here in the way
How could you stay with all that I paid for?
Leave any time, won't let you wait
How could you be sure?
You're holding out hope
I'm seeing it too, I'm trying to follow, oh

I've been through hell and back again
I've come to understand that when
You tell me that I can't pretend
I either care about your stuff
Make the most of the things that might be rough
I let you go

Oh, holding out hope for you
Holding out hope,
Holding out hope for you

You were there for me
And I was there for you
How will I let you go?
You will always be the one that I regret
How will I let you go?
Let you go
Let you go
Let you go
Let you go

Oh, holding out hope for you
Holding out hope,
Holding out hope for you

You were there for me
And I was there for you
Oh oh, I remember times like that!
You will always be the one
That I regret
Ho-ow will I let you go?

Let you go
Let you go
Let you go
Let you go
