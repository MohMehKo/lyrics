You make me wanna take off all of my clothes
You make me wanna show you where that thing goes
You make me wanna dive into all that snow
You make me stay out all night and catch a cold

Never felt so sweet, never ride no skiis like this before
Never been fucked up, never lined it up like this before
Never felt so sweet, you pass the key, unlock my heart
Don't know who you are, but I love you on that Escobar

Powder my nose I'm going out tonight, out tonight, out tonight
Powder my nose I'm going out tonight, out tonight, out tonight
Me and my best friend go wild in the West End
You and my best friend, we cowboys and angels
Red lights stay blinking, we movie stars, movie stars

Beautiful faces, cartilage wasted away
Tell me you love me, baby quit asking my name
Washing regret and adrenaline swept down the drain
Lovely, lovely, lovely, floating away

Never felt so sweet, never ride no skiis like this before
Never been fucked up, never lined it up like this before
Never felt so sweet, you pass the key, unlock my heart
Don't know who you are, but I love you on that Escobar

Powder my nose I'm going out tonight, out tonight, out tonight
Powder my nose I'm going out tonight, out tonight, out tonight
Me and my best friend go wild in the West End
You and my best friend, we cowboys and angels
Red lights stay blinking, we movie stars, movie stars

I'mma bring a white girl, always do it right girl
Keep coming back for more
Keep coming back for more, keep coming back
I'll still be ya brown girl, never let you down girl
You come back for more, dreaming, feigning more
I'mma bring a white girl, always do it right girl
Keep coming back for more
Keep coming back for more, keep coming back
I'll still be ya brown girl, never let you down girl
You come back for more, dreaming, feigning more

Powder my nose I'm going out tonight, out tonight, out tonight
Powder my nose I'm going out tonight, out tonight, out tonight
Me and my best friend go wild in the West End
You and my best friend, we cowboys and angels
Red lights stay blinking, we movie stars, movie stars
