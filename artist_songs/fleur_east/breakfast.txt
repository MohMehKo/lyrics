If I get too drunk, would you take me home?
Or would you leave me in this club on my own?
I don't know nobody, these are all your friends
But a couple look nice, nice enough to buy my breakfast
I wasn't even 'bout to come tonight
But I look way too good to stay inside my house
There ain't nothing left on Netflix
When I'm restless I get reckless
But don't worry 'bout me, don't worry
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry

When I'm restless I get reckless
But don't worry 'bout me, don't worry
Don't worry 'bout me, 'bout me
Alright, alright, alright
Don't worry 'bout me, 'bout me

Don't worry 'bout me, I'm all good
I'm a full grown, I can hold my own
If you're going home, don't take me with you
More friends are coming, I'm taking pictures
Oh, they all look delicious, they own me
So cold I need a Zamboni
You're buying round, you're so Mike Tyson
I'm taking shots, you're still going

No end of day, just drop your cake
We're seventeen in this school bar
Brown bag and set turn swagging
Just let the rhythm run through ya
Sounding off for my check list
My squats are 'round, so sexy
We turn up, no empty cups
We won't be home before breakfast

Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry

Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry
Yeah yeah
Don't worry, don't worry
Alright, alright, alright
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry
Yeah yeah
Don't worry, don't worry
