Start the déjà vu
Every time I walk into the room
Like the smell of my perfume
It goes on and on and on, on and on and on
No one can stop me now
Cause I'm in the mood to shut it down
All night long, it goes
On and on

Did it ever cross your mind
That I could be one of a kind?
Did you never wonder why
I'm forever on a high

[Chorus x2:]
Turn the lights on
Let your body go, uh, let your body go, uh
Everybody get it up, get it up
Get it up, get it up, get it up

Stop the night too soon
Suddenly I start to lose my cool
I'm crying for the moon
It goes on and on and on, on and on and on
No one can hold me back
I've lost my way, I'm way off track
All night long, it goes
On and on

Did it ever cross your mind
That I could be one of a kind?
Did you never wonder why
I'm forever on a high

Did you ever take the time
To really see what's on the inside?
Will you ever recognize
My sorry eyes? It's no surprise

[Chorus x2]

The lights are on but there's no one home
I need to make sure that you're with me when I'm in my zone
You won't see me all until the next morning
Drop a text, calling up my ex, balling
It's appalling, I don't know when to stop
It's like before the night's over I reset the clock
And I don't own a watch, cause I don't watch the time
We'll take it down a notch, because the night is mine
You can go go hard or you can go go home
So before the night's gone, turn the lights on

[Chorus x2]
