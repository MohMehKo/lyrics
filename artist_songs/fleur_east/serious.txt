C'mon! My love!

Fire rewind, this is the time
We cross the line, we came to fetch your love
The past is behind, future's aside
The whole world is our to cover the nature
What I'm feeling right now
Is loving, no doubt
You got my heart caged, [?]

Whatever you want do
That's what I want to do
Whatever you're going to
That's where I'm going to

You're my love, you're my joy
I'm your girl, you're my boy
Is that enough to call it serious?
In my hopes and your dreams
Got no difference between
Is that enough to call it serious?

Somebody says I'm in over my head,
You're just too good, and we both know it's true
The life that I lived I don't regret
Every step that's brought me back
What I'm feeling right now
Is loving, no doubt
You got my heart locked
You won't let me out

Whatever you want do
That's what I want to do
Whatever you're going to
That's where I'm going to

You're my love, you're my joy
I'm your girl, you're my boy
Is that enough to call it serious?
In my hopes and your dreams
Got no difference between
Is that enough to call it serious?

Say love is blind
But I see better with you
I see through it all
Try after try, you're the one who proved you
Deserve to
Yeah yeah yeah
(Your love, your love
your love so good

Your love, your love
your love so good
Your love, your love
your love so good
Your love, your love
your love so good)
You're my love
You're my joy

I'm your girl, you're my boy
Is that enough to call it serious?
In my hopes and your dreams
Got no difference between
Is that enough to call it serious?
(Your love, your love
your love so good
Your love, your love
your love so good
Your love, your love
your love so good
Your love, your love
your love so good)
My love!
