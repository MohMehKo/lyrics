I've lost my way
Looking in a broken mirror
I've lost my way
Looking in a broken mirror

[Chorus:]
I've changed so much
I don't know who I am
It's like looking in a broken mirror
A broken mirror
I've lost my way
Don't know where I began
It's like looking in a broken mirror
A broken mirror, get-get-get-get over

Gotta get over you
Get-get-get-get

[Chorus x3]

Looking in a broken mirror
Looking in a broken mirror
Looking in a broken mirror
Looking in a broken mirror
