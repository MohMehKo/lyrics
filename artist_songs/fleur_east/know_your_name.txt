Now listen!

I already miss you, I ain't even met you
Well, I guess that's the thing about love
It's out there for finding, it's everyone's diamond
And I'm still here digging my numb
I sing all the no sent messages in a bottle I left to drift out to sea
No, don't you be drowning, I like to imagine
That you're out there swimming to me.

I'm so tired of waiting,
I'm running out of patience
I'm throwing all my pennies down a wishing well
I've been going round in circles like a carousel
I'm so tired of waiting,
I'm running out of patience
I've been looking in the city every Friday night
I've been searching through the faces on the subway light

Oh, I'm just tryina find my babe
Hop me on a high speed train
To where, to where you are right now!
I just want to know your name!
Oh, mama said you won't be late,
But I know that you're worth the wait
Yeah yeah, I turn around
'Cause I just want to know your name

I know that you will be six foot three and sexy
But hey, it's okay if you're not
My dad's gonna love, my mom's gonna hug you
The day that you give me the rock!

I'm so tired of waiting,
I'm running out of patience
I've been looking in the city every Friday night
I've been searching through the faces on the subway light

Oh, I'm just tryina find my babe
Hop me on a high speed train
To where, to where you are right now!
I just want to know your name!
Oh, mama said you won't be late,
But I know that you're worth the wait
Yeah yeah, I turn around
'Cause I just want to know your name

My heart is on a mission,
I'm tryina???
The words to fix the puzzle
You're the only piece I'm missing
For you, I'd go the distance
Dream you into my existence
Safe and sounding in my wishes
In my mind I'm taking pictures
To put in the frames
I'm just tired of the game
And I know it sounds insane
'Cause I don't even know your name
I'll take a bus,
I'll take a train
Our love will fly,
I'll take a plane
You're everything I want
So, I'll do anything that I can to find you!

I'm just tryina find my babe
Hop me on a high speed train
To where, to where you are right now!
I just want to know your name!
Oh, mama said you won't be late,
But I know that you're worth the wait
Yeah yeah, I turn around
'Cause I just want to know your name
