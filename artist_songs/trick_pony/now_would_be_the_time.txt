Deep inside I know that you've been hurtin'
And your bitter words were brought on by the pain
I said it's over
Now I'm not so certain
Baby if I knew you felt the same

Now would be the time
To wrap your arms around me
To look me in the eye
Get down to the truth
Well my heart is on the line
Just reach out and take it
If there ever was a chance to change my mind
Now would be the time

Word out on the street is you still want me
There's been a lot of talkin' goin' 'round
And right here at this moment you can show me
We could save this love from goin' down

Now would be the time
To wrap your arms around me
To look me in the eye
Get down to the truth
Well my heart is on the line
Just reach out and take it
If there ever was a chance to change my mind
Now would be the time

Now would be the time
To wrap your arms around me
To look me in the eye
Get down to the truth
Well my heart is on the line
Just reach out and take it
If there ever was a chance to change my mind
Now would be the time

If there ever was a chance to change my mind
Now would be the time
