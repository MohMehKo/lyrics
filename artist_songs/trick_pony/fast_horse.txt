Just a dot on a road map
Nowhere is where we're at
My daddy worked nearly all his life
Just to get here, imagine that
I love you baby and I always will
But please make no mistake
Watchin' paint dry on a Friday night
Is just a bit more tha I can take

I need a fast horse
I'll take a slow train
Gimme a window seat on an airplane
I need a ticket somewhere
And it needs to be far away
They say a wild heart
Will get you so far
And I'm thinkin' that you need a head start
So if you're comin' with me
Baby you're gonna need a fast horse

Tick-tock of the town clock
Never slows down and it don't stop
You only get one time around
And there's not time for a second thought
If you're gonna keep up with somebody like me
Who's way past thinkin' that it's time to leave
If you wait around I'll be gone
On the first thing I get my hands on

I need a fast horse
I'll take a slow train
Gimme a window seat on an airplane
I need a ticket somewhere
And it needs to be far away
They say a wild heart
Will get you so far
And I'm thinkin' that you need a head start
So if you're comin' with me
Baby you're gonna need a fast horse

I need a fast horse
I'll take a slow train
Give me a fast horse
A fast horse
