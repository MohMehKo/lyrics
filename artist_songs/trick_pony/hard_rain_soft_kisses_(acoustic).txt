Listen to that tippin' tappin'
Old tin roof that rain is slappin'
It's been coming down like cats and dogs
Dark grey clouds have settled in
That weather man was wrong again
But I don't care if it lasts all night long
Let it come down all night long...

Hard rain, soft kisses
Porch swing, my wishes
You ain't going anywhere (hear the sound of distance thunder)
Let's stay right here, as long this (feel this spell we're under)
Hard rain, soft kisses

I can hear that distant thunder
Here's a blanket slide on under
Let it take it's own sweet time to stop
We'll make some lightning of our own
Until that summer storm is gone
I've got a kiss for every single drop
And I mean every single drop

Hard rain, soft kisses
Porch swing, my wishes
We ain't going anywhere (hear the sound of distance thunder)
Let's stay right here, as long as this (feel the spell we're under)
Hard rain, soft kisses

Rain drops dancing on the ground, feel the magic coming down

Hard rain, soft kisses
Porch swing, my wishes
No, you ain't going anywhere (hear the sound of distant thunder)
We'll stay right here as long as this (feel the spell we're under)
Hard rain, soft kisses
(Hard rain) hard rain, soft kisses
(Hard rain) hard rain, soft kisses
(Hard rain) hard rain, soft kisses
