To me twelve months is a long, long time.
Someone suddenly changed their mind,
You were sendin' out,
Now it's just too late.
But I won't lose one night of sleep,
Worrying about what was mean't to be.
Yeah, 'cause leavin'
Is just a reason to celebrate.

I'm on a mission, I got a cause.
I'm gonna hit every rockin' little honky-tonk bar,
An' the way I'm thinkin',
It oughta be against the law.
Gonna see what kinda trouble I can find,
I'm on a head-on collision with a real good time.
I'm on a mission,
And it's all about forgettin' tonight.

Forty-hour week and I'm out the door,
Seems like all I've been workin' for,
Is that time when I can finallyjust cut loose.
I got a few good friends and they're waitin' to go.
Just gimme some time to change my clothes.
Till Monday mornin', there ain't nothin' I gotta do.

I'm on a head-on collision with a real good time.
I'm on a mission,
And it's all about forgettin' tonight, that's right.

Ain't worried 'bout a five-day, no sleep, business week, no escape, workin' girl blues.
Yeah, I'm a-just doin' what any other modern-day, American woman might do.
