I woke up this mornin'
With a feelin' that was gone for quite some time
Your long gone face has been replaced
With better thoughts now runnin' through my mind
When you left you cut my heart in half
Just took some time but now I'm makin' my way back

I feel more like me
I've let go of your memory
Now the hands of time have been so kind
And finally set me free
I feel more like me

She compromised and justified
No matter what the cost
Inch by inch became a mile until she just got lost

There was a time when I was strong
Wild and free and runnin' with the wind
But now the chains are finally gone
And I know I'll be that way again
You took my soul and tore it clean in two
But ever since I saw that open door and walked right through

I feel more like me
I've let go of your memory
Now the hands of time have been so kind
And finally set me free
I feel more like me

I compromised and justified
No matter what the cost
Inch by inch became a mile till I just got lost
But there's no more cryin'
'Cause I'm flyin' and today's a brand new day
Just look at me go now
I'm on a roll now
And I think it's safe to say that

I feel more like me
I've let go of your memory
Now the hands of time have been so kind
And finally set me free
I feel more like me
