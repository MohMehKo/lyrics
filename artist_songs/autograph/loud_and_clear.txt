Celebrate the boys who win
Turn it all the way to 10, uh
Do you know what I'm trying to say
Got to give it all away, wooooh

Loud and clear
I want to hear it
Loud and clear
Give it to me
Loud and clear
I gotta have it
Loud and clear
Yeah

One thing that you should know
If it's too loud
You're too old, too old
If you want to turn it down
Better get out of town

Loud and clear
I want to hear it
Loud and clear
Give it to me
Loud and clear
I gotta have it
Loud and clear
Yeah

Cheers for the play
Cheers for the rock
We're working our way
Up to the top, top

Yeah
(Loud and clear)
Loud and clear
(Loud and clear)
Loud and clear
(Loud and clear)
I said, Loud and clear
(Loud and clear)
Yeaaaahh
