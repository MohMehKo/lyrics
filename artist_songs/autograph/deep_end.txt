Yeah, alright, I'm at the bottom, lookin' up
Been there before but once ain't enough
I tried to quit but there ain't no way
I can't live by the light of day

I'm goin' down on a sinkin' boat
I'm off the deep end, throw me a rope

Well, I'm off of the deep end
Yes, I'm off of the deep end
I'm off of the deep end
Somebody throw me a rope

Third strike and I just can't win
I'm a victim of a life of sin
I tried to quit but there ain't no way
Got this guitar and I got to play

I'm goin' down on a sinkin' boat
I'm off the deep end, throw me a rope

Well, I'm off of the deep end
Yes, I'm off of the deep end
I'm off of the deep end
Somebody throw me a rope

I'm goin' down on a sinkin' boat
I'm off the deep end, throw me a rope

I'm off of the deep end
I'm off of the deep end
I'm off of the deep end
I'm off of the deep end
(Somebody throw me a rope)

I'm off of the deep end
(I'm goin' down on a sinkin' boat)
I'm off of the deep end
(Somebody throw me a rope)
I'm off of the deep end
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Alright children, I'm goin' down
