She lies waiting for another kill
Hiding her evil behind her thrill
Another victim, another night
Weaker heart don't even fight

Well, I didn't realize
But Evil's in her eyes

Angel, angel in black
She took me down to hell and back
She's coiled and ready to attack

She's a
Angel in black
Angel in black
She's an angel in black

It's temptation, I can't resist
I'm just a number on her list
[?] good, she always win
Like a segregated dog, she'll take you in

Well, I didn't realize
But Evil's in her eyes

Angel, angel in black
She took me down to hell and back
She's coiled and ready to attack

She's a
Angel in black
Angel in black
She's an angel in black

Helpless, there's no escape
She's in my blood, my heart won't wait
Hopeless, I'm on my knees
There ain't no cure for this disease, oh, oh

Well, I didn't realize
But eye's in her eyes

Angel, angel in black
She took me down to hell and back
She's coiled and ready to attack

She's a
Angel in black
Angel in black
I know she's comin' back

Angel, angel in black
She took me down to hell in back
She's coiled and ready to attack

She's a
Angel in black
Angel in black
She's an angel in black
