Wooh, hey what's that?
Blondes in black cars, yeah
Burning up the boulevard, ow
Blondes in black cars
And they're here for me, yeah

Blondes in black cars, wooh
Burning up the boulevard, yeah
Blondes in black cars
And they're here for me

It was a regular Saturday night
Bored to tears I was feelin' uptight
I needed somethin' to change the scene

So I found a corner to call my own
I struck it plain in the crusin' zone
I was ready to find the American dream

Then from the distance I saw a light
Just like a vision breakin' through the night
All I could see was this beautiful sight

It was blondes in black cars, wooh
Burning up the boulevard
Blondes in black cars
And they're here for me

Blondes in black cars, alright
Burning up the boulevard, ow
Blondes in black cars
And they're here for me

It's like a picture from a magazine
Everybody's trying to make the scene
I gotta get into the game

I can imagine how it's got to feel
With a beautiful blonde in my automobile
I know I'd never be the same

Then from the distance I saw a light
Just like a vision breakin' through the night
All I could see was this beautiful sight

It was blondes in black cars, ow
Burning up the boulevard, wooh
Blondes in black cars
And they're here for me, I can't believe it

Blondes in black cars, ow
Burning up the boulevard, yeah
Blondes in black cars
And they're here for me

Wooh, hey take a look at that one
Hey baby, hey come on over here one time
Hey what's happenin' baby
Wait, hey, hey where you goin'

Blondes in black cars, ow
Burning up the boulevard, yeah
Blondes in black cars
And they're here for me

Wooh, blondes in black cars, yeah
Burning up the boulevard, ow
Blondes in black cars, well alright
Burning up the boulevard, oww

Blondes in black cars
Burning up the boulevard
Blondes in black cars
Blondes in black cars
