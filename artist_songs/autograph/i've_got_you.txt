Maybe once in a dream
Someone walked through the door
And you know your whole life
You've been waiting for her
Like a falling star
It can happen so fast
You know this is the one
That will last forever

You give me life
You're blood through my veins
Every beat of my heart calls out your name

If the world crumbles at my feet
Falls into the sea
It's alright, I've got you
Sky comes fallin' down
Tumblin' to the ground
It's alright, I've got you
I've got you

When the road gets so rough
And I can't take no more
Like a prayer from above
Baby you're my shelter

Love lifts you up
Won't let you down
When it's all said and done
You'll still be around

If the world crumbles at my feet
Falls into the sea
It's alright, I've got you
Sky comes fallin' down
Tumblin' to the ground
It's alright, I've got you, oh yeah

Got a wish on a star
Got an angel of mercy, oh yeah
Like a light in the dark
Baby you're shining on me, yeah

If the world crumbles at my feet
Falls into the sea
It's alright, I've got you
Sky comes fallin' down
Tumblin' to the ground
It's alright, I've got you

I've got you...
