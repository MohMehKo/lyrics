Like a chill on a summer day
I try to run, but I can't get away
Don't need the, the lock is broken
And all of our words have been spoken

I understand, I understand
She's changin' hands, from me to you
There's nothing left that I can do
She's changin' hands, she's made her plans
And somehow I must stand and face the truth

Half past ten, quarter of the moon
Time's run out, one night too soon
Won't read the book, I know the ending
There is no use, in our pretending

I understand, I understand
She's changin' hands, from me to you
There's nothing left that I can do
She's changin' hands, she's made her plans
And somehow I must stand and face the truth

And the memory of her stare
Seems to haunt me everywhere
It's a mark I can't erase
It's a fact that's hard to face

She's changin' hands, from me to you
There's nothing left that I can do, no no
She's changin' hands, she's made her plans
And somehow I must stand and face the truth, yeah

Changin' hands, yeah yeah yeah
Changin' hands, yeah
I know she's changin' hands
Changin' hands
