Listen to this

I live a life that
Some can't figure out
Finding excitement
Before it gives out
Oh I like my women
And I like my fun
Well I ain't gonna stop
Til I've had one

Cause I'm a bad boy
Nothing but a bad boy
I'm a bad boy
I'll always be a bad boy
Yeahah woooh
Ain't that the truth

I can't get a job
Can't get out of bed
Last night's still
Ringing in my head (woooh)
I like to party
Til I get my fill
Well spent all my time
Trying to get me a pill

Cause I'm a bad boy
Nothing but a bad boy
I'm a bad boy
I'll always be a bad boy
Yeahah
Bad boy
I'm nothing but a bad boy
Yeeaahh

Listen to this

I've made a career
Out of breaking the rules
And I've learned all the lessons
They don't teach you in school
I used to think
That my life was unfair
But I stayed out there
Cause I just don't care

Bad boy
Nothing but a bad boy
Yeah I'm a bad boy
Always be a bad boy
Woooh
I'm a bad boy
I'm nothing but a bad boy
Yeah I'm a bad boy
Always be a bad boy
Aaaahhhh
Bad boy
Bad boy
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Bad boy
Bad boy
Woooh
Bad boy
Alright
Bad boy
Bad boy
Bad boy
Bad boy
Bad boy
Bad boy
