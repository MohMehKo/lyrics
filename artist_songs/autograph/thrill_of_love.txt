Two hearts on a hot night
And the sting of cupid's bite
Sweet words and loose lips
Desire born with fingertips

This is the magic moment
Chemistry at it's best
Try not to lose the feeling
Try not to lose 
Your precious thrill
Feel the thrill, thrill of love
You gotta feel the thrill
Thrill of love

It's an ageless recipe
Human equation A plus B
At the touch of skin on skin
A chain reaction does begin

This is the magic moment
Chemistry at it's best
Try not to lose the feeling
Try not to lose
Your precious thrill
Feel the thrill, thrill of love
You gotta feel the thrill
Thrill of love
Come on and feel the thrill
Thrill of love

Feel the thrill, thrill of love
You gotta feel the thrill
Thrill of love
Come on and feel the thrill
Thrill of love
Ooh feel the thrill
Thrill of love
