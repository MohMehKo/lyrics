She's the dangerous type
With a powerful spell
Yeah she took me
From heaven to hell
She went right for my heart
And I couldn't resist
Just to taste
Of her poisonous kiss

Now I face from her race
Heart attack
I could feel the dagger in my back
Heart attack
Never ever, no time to react
Heart attack
And I know she's never lookin'
Never lookin' back
She give the heart attack

With a wink of her eye
I was in the eclipse of the light
That she flicked on her lips
Such a beautiful thrill
When she did me at last
Well she used me
And left me for dead
Overrun, I need 9-1-1

Heart attack
I could feel the dagger in my back
Heart attack
Never ever, no time to react
Heart attack
And I know she's never lookin'
Never lookin' back, nooo

She's the mesmerizing kind
With a hypnotizing mind
And she gets inside your head
When she gets you into bed

Now I face from her race
Heart attack
I could feel the dagger in my back
Heart attack
Never ever, no time to react
Heart attack
And I know she's never lookin'
Never lookin' back
She give the heart attack
She give the heart attack
