I know a place where we can go
Where we can let our feelings show
It's like a dream inside the brain
Once that you're there (or) (once the truth ends)
Your life will change

Oh you walk down the avenue
Holding your head high feeling cool
Cause you know the score
In the game of life
It's not who's on top
But who holds the knife

Cloud 10
It's a rough neighborhood
Cloud 10
It's not enough being good
Cloud 10
If you can find the time
It's just one step up from Cloud 9

Ooh every eye is right on you
Thinking they know
What you've been through
But you don't stop
It's what you see that counts
And not what you say
But what you leave out

Well I know you had a good time
And I know you've been to Cloud 9
But I want to take you
Where you've never been
Let me take you
Cl-cl-cl-cl-Cloud 10

It's a rough neighhorhood
Cloud 10
It's not enough being good
Cloud 10
If you can find the time
Cloud 10
It's just a step up from Cloud 9
Cloud 10
Yeahah
Cloud 10
I want to take you
Cloud 10
Yeahah, come on
Cloud 10
Everybody
