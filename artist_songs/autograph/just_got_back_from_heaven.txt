I never gave myself away
Love was not a word worth sayin'
Never stayed more than one night
That's the game that I was playin'

But everything just changed...like a revelation
I'll never be the same, 'cause I

Just got back from heaven
Heaven is in your arms
I just got back from heaven
And heaven is where you are
I just got back from heaven

Never let my feelings show...no
I just put them all behind me
Lived a life of hit and run
I thought that love could never find me

But everything just changed...like a revelation
I'll never be the same, 'cause I

Just got back from heaven
And heaven is in your arms
I just got back from heaven
Heaven is where you are
I just got back from heaven

Well, I just got back today...wooooh

I-I-I
Just got back from heaven
Heaven is in your arms
I just got back from heaven
Heaven is where you are
I just got back from heaven
Heaven is in your arms
I just got back from heaven
Wooooh
Well, I just got back
Yeah, yeah, yeah
