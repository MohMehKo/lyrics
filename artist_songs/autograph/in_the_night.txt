She sits alone, just starin' at the telephone 
Another night she waits, for her imaginary date 
The same old story's got her in a trance 
Just like her books of Harlequin romance

In the night 
When she's all by herself, oh 
That's the time 
She'll be cryin' for help, oh 
In the night 
When there's no one in sight 
And no one to hold her tight, yeah 
She'll be cryin' in the night

She hopes someday, love is gonna come her way 
With each year that goes by 
It's harder hidin' all the hurt inside 
She hopes her story has a happy end, oooh 
Just like she reads in books of Harlequin

In the night 
When she's all by herself, oh 
That's the time 
She'll be cryin' for help, oh 
In the night 
When there's noone in sight 
And noone to hold her tight, yeah 
She'll be cryin' in the night

J-J-Just another lonely night 
J-J-Just another lonely life 
Another victim of and endless fight 
For love...yeah, yeah, yeah

In the night 
When she's all by herself, yeah 
That's the time 
She'll be cryin' for help, oh 
In the night 
When she turns out the light, oh 
That's the time
