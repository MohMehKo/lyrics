Temptation

Temptation
Sweet Temptation

I feel the flame
Burnin' within me
I smell the smoke
From the fire below
I feel the lust
Growing inside me
And people who eat flesh
Consuming my soul

I start to shake
Hooked on desire
I need the rush
Of the magic inside
I feel the kiss
Sweat on my body
I burn with the breath
From the heat of the night

I've tasted sin
Can't help giving in

Sweet temptation
Sweet temptation
Can't resist
Temptation
Sweet temptation
Oh no
Won't let me go

Skin to skin
Simple seduction
Tasted blood
Now I've got to have more
No way out
Can't find the power
It cuts like a dagger
I just can't ignore
It's easy to tell
I'm under a spell

Sweet temptation
Sweet temptation
Can't resist
Temptation
Sweet temptation
Oh no
Won't let me go

I've tasted sin
Can't help giving in

Temptation
Sweet temptation
Temptation
Sweet temptation
Temptation
Sweet temptation
Can't resist
Temptation
Sweet temptation
Oh no
Temptation
Sweet temptation
Couldn't resist
Temptation
Sweet temptation
Oh no
It won't let me go
