Na nana na nana...
Ohhh
Oh yeah

I feel a shiver
Soaring through the air
I never hit and run
One night affairs
Yeah yeah yeah
I hear the animals
Start to howl
Nobody's safe
When the wolves are
On the prowl
On the prowl

I'm looking for some shelter
I'm reaching out my hand
A little peace and passion
Understand
Understand

Na nana na nana
I need a little sanctuary
Na nana na nana
Give me some sanctuary
Na nana na nana
Give me your sanctuary
Be my peace
Be my peace
Yeah ow ow

I see the signs
Flashing in the sky
I know it's gonna be
A long and lonely night
A lonely night
I've got the cure
For the weak at heart
Skip a beat
You're dead
Before you start
Before you start

Don't want to play with fire
I only need some heat
A little peace and comfort
In the sheets
In the sheets
Yeah

Na nana na nana
I need a little sanctuary
Na nana na nana
Give me your sanctuary
Na nana na nana
Give me my sanctuary
Be my peace
Be my peace

Been looking nowhere
For what I can't dream
The blind are leading the blind
But such a feeling
For what I'm hoping to find

Yeah yeah
Come on come on

Na nana na nana
I need a little sanctuary
Na nana na nana
Give me your sanctuary, yeah
Na nana na nana
Come on and be my peace
Na nana na nana
Come on and be my peace
Na nana na nana
Yeah yeah yeah
