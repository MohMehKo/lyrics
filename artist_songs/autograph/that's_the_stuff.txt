I know that anything can happen
And nothin's over `till the end
If everyone's created equal
Then we both got a chance to win

(And nothin's out of reach) oh, no
(It's what they always teach)

That's the stuff
That's the stuff
That's the stuff, that dreams are made of
That's the stuff
That's the stuff
That's the stuff, that turns me on
That's the stuff
That's the stuff
That's the stuff, that dreams are made of
That's the stuff
That's the stuff
That's the stuff, that keeps me hangin' on

I always see it on the T.V.
I always read it in the news
Someone's becoming rich and famous
Another fairy tale comes true

(And nothin's out of reach) oh, no
(It's what they always teach)

That's the stuff
That's the stuff
That's the stuff, that dreams are made of
That's the stuff
That's the stuff
That's the stuff, that turns me on
That's the stuff
That's the stuff
That's the stuff, that dreams are made of
That's the stuff
That's the stuff
That's the stuff, that keeps me hangin' on

I see a lot of a good life
And I want a piece of their pie
Don't say it ain't gonna happen, no
Cause I'm gonna shoot for the sky, yeah

That's the stuff
That's the stuff
That's the stuff, that dreams are made of
That's the stuff
That's the stuff
That's the stuff, that turns me on, yeah
That's the stuff
That's the stuff
That's the stuff, that dreams are made of
That's the stuff
That's the stuff
That's the stuff, that keeps me hangin' on
That's the stuff
That's the stuff
