She's got nice wheels and a ponytail
She's qualified and on the trail
Just like the speed of light
It's happenin' at first sight
She's hungry for a male
And when it comes to us
She'll leave you in her dust

Lady's built for speed
Lady's all I need
Lady's built for speed
Lady's all I need

Zero to sixty in a glance
She's like a hotrod for romance
She always looks so fine
Don't need no starting line
She'll put you in her trance
She's got four on the floor
She'll leave you wanting more

Lady's built for speed
Lady's all I need
Lady's built for speed
Lady's all I need

Lady's built for, Lady's built for
Lady's built for, Lady's built for
Lady's built for, Lady's built for
Lady's built for, Lady's built for speed

Lady's built for speed (yeah yeah yeah)
Lady's all I need (that girl is all I need)
Lady's built for speed (ow)
Lady's all I need (ah, she's all I need)
