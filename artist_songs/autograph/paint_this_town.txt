Well I'm all dressed up with somewhere to go
I got money in my pocket, I'm primed, it shows
And I've got no problem findin' friends...no
We gonna do it and hope that it never ends

Well we're pullin' out the stops
And we're turnin' back the clocks
You better hope you gotta piece of the rock

Paint this town
Hey bartender I'm buyin' the rounds
Paint this town
Flip on the jukebox, don't turn it down
Paint this town
We're gonna rock this place into the ground

I gotta tank of gas and a shiny car
I gotta rope around my lucky star
And I don't have a single doubt, no
That tonight we're gonna blow it out

Well we're pullin' out the stops
And we're turnin' back the clocks
You better hope you gotta piece of the rock

Paint this town
Hey bartender I'm buyin' the rounds
Paint this town
Flip on the jukebox, don't turn it down
Paint this town
We're gonna rock 'till the moon goes down
Paint this town
We're gonna rock this place into the ground

'Hey, drinks are on me'
'Hey, come on over here'
'Check it out dude'
'Brand new credit card'
'Hey, double shots for everybody'

C'mon
Paint this town
Hey bartender I'm buyin' the rounds
Paint this town
Flip on the jukebox, don't turn it down
Paint this town
We're gonna rock 'till the moon goes down
Paint this town
We're gonna rock this place into the ground

Paint this town
Paint this town
Paint this town

'Feels like a party'
