You can see us comin' if you open your eyes
Know we got our foot to the floor
Get up against the wall and drop your disguise
`Cause we're stayin' till there ain't anymore

Take, take, take no prisoners
Take no prisoners
We're gonna take no prisoners
We're gonna break a few hearts and be on our way, yeah

There's a hundred glasses lifted up in the air
And no one's headed for the door
There's a hundred faces and they ain't got a care
Singin' "party till we're on the floor"

Take no prisoners
Take no prisoners
We're gonna take no prisoners
We're gonna break a few hearts and be on our way, yeah

Life is too short for the 9 to 5
Gotta blow it all away
If you need a lesson, I'll show you my way
If you take a minute, I'll give you a day

Take, take, take no prisoners (no)
Take no prisoners (no, no)
Take no prisoners
Take no prisoners
Take no prisoners (breakin' those hearts)
Take no prisoners (liftin' those glasses)
Take no prisoners (breakin' those hearts)
Take no prisoners
