Friday evening on the boulevard
All the boys hoping 
That they'll met
All the girls
Standing on the street
Friday evening when 
The lights come on
Everyone's in their Sunday best
Putting their purchase to the test

Friday evening on the boulevard
You can forget about the day
And you can be anyone to play
Friday evening when
The lights come on
Everyone gets their hopes up high
Reaching for the pie up in the sky

I can't wait til Friday evening
I can't wait til Friday
When the hope they live on
Becomes so bright (oh so bright)
I'll drink a toast to every Friday
(I'll drink a toast, yeah)
Friday night, whoaaoh Friday night

Friday evening on the boulevard
Everyone's wearing their disguise
Hiding the truth 
That's in their eyes
Friday evening on the boulevard
When the lights come on
That's when the drink 
Begins to flow
That's when the truth
Begins to show

I can't wait til Friday evening
I can't wait til Friday
When the hopes they live on
(Ba-ba-ba) Becomes (oh) so bright
I'll drink a toast to every Friday
(I'll drink a toast, yeah)
Friday night, whoaaoh Friday night

Friday [whispered]
I'm a good boy
Friday [whispered]
When the night gets hot
Friday [whispered]
On the boulevard, yeah
Friday [whispered]
I'm gonna take my shot

Friday evening on the boulevard
(Friday on the boulevard)
Friday evening on the boulevard
(Friday on the boulevard, yeah)
Friday evening on the boulevard
Whoaaoh, I'm gonna take my shot

Friday evening on the boulevard
When the night, when the night
When the night gets hot-ot-ot
Friday evening on the boulevard
Whoa
Friday evening (yeah) 
On the boulevard
