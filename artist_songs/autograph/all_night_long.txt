Sitting there staring
Do it right on cue
Some girls know just what to do
We got so sweet in the sheets
You really knocked me off my feet
Uh
Yeah yeah yeah

Popping that colt
Too loud today
Some girls know just what to say
One shot in the slot
Shoot that pistol til it's hot
Uh
Yeah yeah yeah

All night long
Baby I want you
All night long
Do you want me too
All night long
Baby I want you
All night long
Do you want me too
Ooh yeah

Rapping their lines
Hit the bottom stair
Some girls know just what to wear
One night dynamite
Grab that pole
And hold on tight
Yeah yeah yeah

All night long
Baby I want you
All night long
Do you want me too
All night long
Baby I want you
All night long
Tell me, do you want me too

All night long
Baby I want you
All night long
Do you want me too
All night long
Baby I want you
All night long
Tell me, do you want me too
Oh, all night long
Yeah yeah
I want, I want
Baby I want you, you
Again, come on
Now tell me
Do you want me too
Oh yeah
Come on baby
I want you
Come on
Well I want you
Ooh
All night long
Yeah
