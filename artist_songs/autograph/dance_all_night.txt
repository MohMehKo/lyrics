Coast to coast, there's a brand new line, yeah
Coast to coast, there's a brand new crime
Everywhere, there is something in the air
All the people say

Shake it up don't stop
Take it up to the top

Dance all night, to your heartbeat (heartbeat)
Dance all night, to your heartbeat (heartbeat)
Dance all night, to the beat on the street
Dance all night, to your heartbeat (heartbeat)
Dance all night
Gotta do it 'till we get it right, oh yeah

All night long, hear the call of the wild, yeah
All night long, feelin' free as a child
All around, you can listen to the sound
Hear the people say

Shake it up don't stop
Take it up to the top

Dance all night, to your heartbeat (heartbeat)
Dance all night, to your heartbeat (heartbeat)
Dance all night, to the beat on the street
Dance all night, to your heartbeat (heartbeat)
Dance all night
Gotta do it 'till we get it right
Dance all night

Dance all night, to your heartbeat...yeah
Dance all night, to your heartbeat...c'mon
Dance all night, to the beat on the street
Dance all night, to your heartbeat..ahhhhhhh
Dance all night, to your heartbeat...wooooh
Dance all night, to your heartbeat
Dance all night...everybody
Dance all night...yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dance all night...ahh
Dance all night
