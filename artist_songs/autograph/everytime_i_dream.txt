Shadows are falling
Moon's getting bright
Feeling's getting stronger
Closing in with the night
I know it's coming
Everynight's the same
Wake up in a cold sweat
Reaching out and calling your name

Can't stop the night time
I try and I try
Run from my slumber
But there's nowhere to hide
Love is a nightmare
Tear me apart
Well I know you're out there
Waiting like a shot in the dark

Everytime I dream
Everytime I dream
You know I only dream of you
Everytime I dream
Everytime I dream
I know there's nothing I can do
I only dream of you

Cold in the morning
Clouds are in the sky
I hear a voice come thru the wind
And you're still on my mind
See you out of nowhere
Reach the hole you try
When I look into your eyes
I wake up in the dead of the night

Everytime I dream
Everytime I dream
You know I only dream of you
Everytime I dream
Everytime I dream
I know there's nothing I can do
No no no

If I could get you here with me
I know that I could make you see
And if I ever get you face to face
I know you'll never ever
You'll never go away

Everytime I dream
Everytime I dream
You know I only dream of you
Everytime I dream
Everytime I dream
I know there's nothing I can do
Everytime I dream
Yeah everytime I dream
You know I only dream of you
Everytime I dream
Everytime I dream
I know there's nothing I can do
