She got the moon in her hand
And the stars in her eyes
She lights up the night
As she turns on the sky
It's ol' Angela
Got the world at her feet
And you can find her
Where the east and west meet
I gotta call out, gotta call out

Angela
Can you hear me, yeah
Calling out your name
Angela
If you touch me
I'll never be the same
Angela
I can't see you
You're always in my dreams
Angela
Don't you know
That you're everything to me

Yeah

She got the world on a string
And it's under control
She turns on the fun
And everything below
It's all about her
It's just a part of her plan
And she can change you
With a wave of her hand
I gotta call out, gotta call out

Angela
Can you hear me, yeah
Calling out your name
Angela
If you touch me
I'll never be the same
Angela
I can't see you, yeah
You're always in my dreams
Angela
Don't you know
That you're everything I need

Angela
I need you
Angela
I need you

Angela
Can you hear me, yeah
Calling out your name
Angela
If you touch me
I'll never be the same
Angela
I can't see you, yeah
You're always in my dreams
Angela
Don't you know
That you're everything I need

Angela
I need you
