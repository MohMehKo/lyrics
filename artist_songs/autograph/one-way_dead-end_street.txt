Ooh, my life, gonna do just what I like
Ooh, my past, spend it like I want
I don't need advice, tellin' me what I should do
Well, I'll make my own mistakes before I'm through

Oh yeah, I'm headed for the flame
Got my feet right on the edge
Oh no, nobody left to blame
If I fall right off the ledge

(Living on)
A one-way dead-end street
(Living on)
Salvation avenue
(Living on)
A one-way dead-end street
(Living on)
A dangerous attitude

Ooh, my life, got to live it for myself
Ooh, my dream, gonna chase it if I want
I don't need somebody bitten my some other man
I don't need help in taking my own stand

Oh yeah, I'm starin' at the sun
But I lay it on the ground
Oh no, gotta know that I can run
If the sky comes fallin' down

(Living on)
A one-way dead-end street
(Living on)
Salvation avenue
(Living on)
A one-way dead-end street
(Living on)
A dangerous attitude

Oh yeah, well, I'm headed for the flame
Got my feet right on the edge
Oh no, nobody left to blame
If I fall right off the ledge

(Living on)
A one-way dead-end street
(Living on)
Salvation avenue
(Living on)
A one-way dead-end street
(Living on)
