Been drivin' down that
Lonely highway for so long
Just waited for the
Right one to come along
Too many nights sittin' all alone
Without a reason why
I tell a friend that there's
Nothing wrong but I know it's a lie

I've done time
Trying to make it right
I found out there's
No need to fight

Love comes easy, yeah
Love takes control
Love comes easy, yeah
Love only knows

I know the sound of an
Empty heartbeat, it's so clear
I know the dream of a
Thousand nights, I feel it so near

No one knows
How to make it right
You can try
But you just can't fight

Love comes easy, yeah
Love takes control
Love comes easy, yeah
Love only knows

I was waiting so patiently
And when I least expected
Love came 'round for me

Love only knows, yeah
Love takes control, oh oh

Love comes easy, yeah
Love only knows
Love comes easy, yeah
Love takes control, yeah
Love comes easy, yeah
Love only knows, oh oh
Love comes easy, yeah
Love takes control, yeah
Love only knows, oh
Love takes control, yeah
Love only knows, oh
