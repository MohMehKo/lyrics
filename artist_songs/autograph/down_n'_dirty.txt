Wooooh
Alright

Hey you, get up on your feet
Hey you, feel the big bad beat
Hey you, how could you be blue
Hey you, now's your turn to groove

[Chorus:]
Get down
Down
Down
Down and dirty
Hey kid hear the news
Everybody's got loot to lose
Down
Down
Down and dirty
Hey kid feel the groove
Gonna watch this place
Begin to move
Down
Down
Down

Hey you, listen to the call
Hey you, it's a free-for-all
Hey you, take her to the top
Hey you, we're never gonna stop

[Chorus]

Take a breath
Don't say no
Ready, set
Here we go
Take a breath
Don't say no
Ready, set
Here we go

[Chorus]

Down (down)
Down (down)
Down and dirty
Down (down)
Down (down)
Down (down)
Down and dirty
Down (down)
Down (down)
Down (down)
Down and dirty
Down
Down
Down
