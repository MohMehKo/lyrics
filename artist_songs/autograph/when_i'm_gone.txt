Cold rain, cold heart
I felt it comin' from the start
One touch, one feel
I knew it just wasn't real

So clear, to see
You wanted something but it still wasn't me
So long, goodbye
My turn to leave, it's your turn to cry

Who you gonna reach for in the morning
Who you gonna reach for in the night
When I'm gone
You'll be left with all the loneliness around you
Who you gonna get to hold you tight
When I'm gone

One dream, one night
Feel it fading with a glimmer of light
So close, so far
A love that could have been ours

No room, for me
Well you can have all the freedom you need
'Cause love comes and love goes
Where I'm goin', you'll never know

Who you gonna reach for in the morning
Who you gonna reach for in the night...oh
When I'm gone
You'll be left with all the loneliness around you
Who you gonna get to hold you tight
When I'm gone

I remember the night that we met, oh
And the moment I looked in your eyes
When you touched me I started to sweat, yeah
My heart started to beat from the heat in the night

When I'm gone
Who you gonna reach for in the morning
Who you gonna reach for in the night, oh
When I'm gone
You'll be left with all the loneliness around you
Who you gonna get to hold you tight
When I'm gone

When I'm gone (when I'm gone)
