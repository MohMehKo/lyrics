Everyday I'm watchin'
People everywhere
Walkin' down that red line
Ain't no time to care

It's a pressure cooker
Livin' for today
It's a Ouija future
Getting' in our way

When you live life on the edge
It's a very narrow ledge
It's the way of life today
Somethin' we can't change

(Crazy boy) crazy boy
(Crazy girl) crazy girl
(Livin' in) livin' in
A crazy world
(Crazy me) crazy me
(Crazy you) crazy you
(Can't you see) can't you see
We're crazy too

It's an occupation
Tryin' to stay alive
Drinkin' down the courage
Helps us to survive
Life's a ring of fire
You can fall right through
For the ones who make it
Here's a toast to you

When you live life on the edge
It's a very narrow ledge
It's the way of life today
Somethin' we can't change

(Crazy boy) crazy boy
(Crazy girl) crazy girl
(Livin' in) livin' in
A crazy world
(Crazy me) crazy me
(Crazy you) crazy you
(Can't you see) can't you see
We're crazy too

(Crazy boy) crazy boy
(Crazy girl) crazy girl
(Livin' in) livin' in a
A crazy world
(Crazy me) crazy me
(Crazy you) crazy you
(Can't you see) can't you see
We're crazy too
