So it didn't work out like you'd planned
Baby that's how it goes
You gave all you had to that man
Honey, even your clothes

You're feelin' used
And you're feelin' abused
So you took a fall
Well it happens to us all

You'll get over it
Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose
You'll get over it
Everybody's got to pay their dues

So you thought it was love at first sight
Well I guess you were wrong
And you didn't give much of a fight
After waiting so long

You made your mistake
You have to live with your heartache
Yeah, you took a fall
Well it happens to us all

You'll get over it
Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose
You'll get over it
Everybody pays their dues
You'll get over it
Yeah, you're gonna get over it

Maybe it's your turn, to play the fool
Maybe now you'll learn, love can be so cruel, yeah

Wooh, c'mon girl

You'll get over it
Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose
You'll get over it
Everybody pays their dues
You'll get over it, I know you're gonna get over it
You'll get over it
You'll get over it, you're gonna get, you're gonna get
You're gonna get over it
You'll get over it
