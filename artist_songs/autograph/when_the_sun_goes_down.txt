Alright

Checked out of work today
Bought'em in an uptown spree
The night's coming on
And we're all getting
Ready to leave
Black silk stockings
Like an Audi on the avenue
Feel it breaking out of the dark
Like a dream come true
Living in the heart of the night
With a party due

When the sun goes down
That's when the music
Starts to play
When the sun goes down
We can forget our time today

Yeah

Open the door at midnight
That's where we'll be
On the moonlight highway
Daytime never sees
We're riding on the night shift
Train rolling right on through
Every sundown
Til the daylight falls on you
Living in the heart of the night
With a party due

When the sun goes down
That's when the music
Starts to play
When the sun goes down
We can forget our time today
When the sun goes down
That's when I start to come alive
When the sun goes down (woooh)
That's when I shift to overdrive

When the sun goes down
That's when the music
Starts to play
When the sun goes down
We can forget our time today
When the sun goes down
That's when I start to come alive
When the sun goes down
That's when I shift to overdrive
Yeah
When the sun goes down
Ooooohh oh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
When the sun goes down
Aaaaahhhhh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
When the sun goes down
