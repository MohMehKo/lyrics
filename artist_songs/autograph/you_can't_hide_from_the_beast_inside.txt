There's an evil lurking in the night
and it gets inside of you.
There's a terror with a fatal bite;
nothing's left when it gets through.

It can hypnotize with its evil eyes,
no one hears your cry when it gets hold of you.

[Chorus:]
You can't run from the beast inside of you,
you can't hide from the eyes that see right through.
You can't run, you can't hide,
There ain't nothing you can do
Can't get away from the beast inside of you.

It can change before your very eyes 
like a nightmare coming true.
With a touch of death you're paralyzed, 
and it controls your every move.

It's inside your soul
Taking all control
Hear the bells that toll
there calling after you.

[Chorus]

You can't run from the beast inside of you,
you can't hide from the eyes that see right through.
You can't run, no no
you can't hide, no you can't hide!
You can't run,
You can't hide.
