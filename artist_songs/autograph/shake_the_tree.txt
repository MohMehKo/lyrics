Some people like to leave it all up to fate.
This life is too short. Ain't got a minute to wait.
Ain't gonna step back too shy. Come what may.
I never could let it go.
I gotta make it, take it all away.
The only thing I know.

Shake the tree. (shake the tree)
Only way to see what's coming down.
Shake the tree. (shake the tree)
I ain't gotta try to wait around
No, no, no

So hard to change it
Once you're caught in a rut
You got to kick it, if the door's been shut.
Ain't gonna lay back, just lack, let it be.
I never could let it go.
I gotta stand tall, do it all.
That's just me,
The only thing I know.

Shake the tree. (shake the tree)
Only way to see what's coming down.
Shake the tree. (shake the tree)
I ain't gotta try to wait around, no no no.

When you get the chance, do it.
Don't mess around. Just cant chew it.

Shake the tree. (shake the tree)
Only way to see what's coming down.
Shake the tree. (shake the tree)
I ain't gotta try to wait around.

Shake the tree. (shake the tree)
Only way to see what's coming down.
Shake the tree. (shake the tree)
I ain't gotta try to wait around.

Shake the tree
You gotta shake it.
Shake the tree.
But don't you break it.
Shake the tree.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
