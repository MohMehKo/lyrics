Hey kid, wake up
It's waiting for you under the sun
Hold it, learn it
What you want's already begun

Don't let regret start a party in your head
Nowhere compares to the places you'll be left
(Close your eyes and don't forget)

Hey, you know that you're alright
Hey, you know that you're alright now
After the dark, it will burn bright
Hey, you know that you're alright now

Ooh Ooh alright
Ooh Ooh alright

Breathe it, be it
Feel it running through your veins
Driving forward
Constantly changing lanes
(Nothing ever stays the same)

Hey, you know that you're alright
Hey, you know that you're alright now
After the dark, it will burn bright
Hey, you know that you're alright now

Ooh Ooh alright
Hey, you know that you're alright now
Ooh Ooh alright

Your one and only
Your one and only
You're feeling lonely cause we're all alright

Your one and only
Your one and only
You're feeling lonely cause we're all alright tonight

Hey, you know that you're alright
Hey, you know that you're alright now
After the dark, it will burn bright
Hey, you know that you're alright now

Ooh Ooh alright
Hey, you know that you're alright now
Ooh Ooh alright
Hey, you know that you're all alright tonight
