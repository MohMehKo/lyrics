You’ve been outta touch and we’re on and off
Feeling like a ragdoll
Our love is missing soul and I gotta know
Baby this is last call

I know I know I know a you bring me down
‘Cause we go we go we go we go we go round

You’re a little bit yesterday
But I’m kickin’ it here today
You’re dope at the game you play
But I’m not your boomerang
You’re a little bit fire show
I’m a little bit H2O
It’s time that I let you go
I’m not your boomerang

Oh ohh ohhh
Hey hey
I’m not your boomerang
Oh ohh ohhh
Hey hey
I’m not your boomerang

If we were building Rome
And you carried stone
We’d be done tomorrow
You gotta give it up
Just to get it back
That’s the way the heart goes

I know I know I know a you bring me down
‘Cause we go we go we go we go we go round

You’re a little bit yesterday
But I’m kickin’ it here today
You’re dope at the game you play
But I’m not your boomerang
You’re a little bit fire show
I’m a little bit H2O
It’s time that I let you go
I’m not your boomerang

Oh ohh ohhh
Hey hey
I’m not your boomerang
Oh ohh ohhh
Hey hey
I’m not your boomerang

How long how long
Can we go round in a circle
How long how long
Don’t wanna let you go
How long how long
Can we go round in a circle
How long how long

You’re a little bit yesterday
But I’m kickin’ it here today
You’re dope at the game you play
But I’m not your boomerang
You’re a little bit fire show
I’m a little bit H2O
It’s time that I let you go
I’m not your boomerang

Oh ohh ohhh
Hey hey
I’m not your boomerang
Oh ohh ohhh
Hey hey
I’m not your boomerang
Oh ohh ohhh
Hey hey
I’m not your boomerang
Oh ohh ohhh
Hey hey
I’m not your boomerang
