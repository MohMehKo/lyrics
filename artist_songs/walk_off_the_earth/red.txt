Saw you looking for a light
Face painted cigarette white
You asked the cleanest boy you found
You couldn't see me turned around
His fingers stretched across your empty gaze
But I just cant escape

As the red fades from your wrinkled dress
Picture all the people you've impressed
Hangs on a wall around here
Vision starts to crawl when I'm near
And the evening waits
While you get caught up to your own mistakes
Made up of different lines
I wouldn't wanna keep in my mind

I wondered why you'd come around
Remembering your little girl frown
Your answers kept the crowd at bay
With compliments unwilling to pay
I had some things id like to say to you
But they just cant be true

As the red fades from your wrinkled dress
A picture of the people you've impressed
Hangs on a wall around here
Vision starts to crawl when I'm near
And the evening waits
While you get caught up to your own mistakes
Made up of different lines 
I wouldn't wanna keep in my mind

As the red fades from your wrinkled dress
A picture of the people you've impressed
Hangs on a wall around here
Vision starts to crawl when I'm near
And the evening waits
While you get caught up to your own mistakes
Made up of different lines
I wouldn't wanna keep in my mind.
