Rip the earth in two with your mind
Seal the urge which ensues
with brass wires

I never meant you any harm
Now your tears feel as warm on my forearm

Close my eyes for a while
Rip from the world your patient smile

How can you say that your truth
is better than ours?
Shoulder to shoulder, now brother,
we carry no arms

A blind man sleeps
in the doorway, his home
If only I had enemies bigger than my
apathy I could have won

But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all

Close my eyes for a while
Rip from the world your patient smile

But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all

And you rip it from my hands
just to say it's all gone
And you rip out all I had
just to say that you've won

And you rip it from my hands
just to say it's all gone
And you rip out all I had
just to say that you've won

You've won
And now you've won

I gave you all
I gave you all
