Everybody just have a good time
And we gon' make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gon' make you lose your mind
We just wanna se ya
Shake that

In the club party rock
Lookin' for your girl?
She on my jock
Non stop when we in the spot,
Booty movin' weight like she own the block.
Where's the drink
I gots to know
Tight jean's, tattoo 'cause I'm rock and roll,
Half black
Half white
Domino
Gane the money out the door

I'm running through these hoes like drano
I got that devilish flow
Rock and roll no halo

We party rock
Yeah!!
That's the crew
that I'm reppin
On the rise to the top
No led in our zeppelin

Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gon' make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gon' make you lose your mind
We just wanna see ya
Shake that!!

Everyday I'm shuffling

Step up fast
and be the first girl to make
me throw this cash
We get money
don't be mad now stop... Hatin' is bad
One more shot for us
(Another round)
Please fill up my cup
(Don't mess around)
We just wanna see
(You shake it now)
Now you home with me
(You're naked now)

Get up get down put your hands up to the sound [3x]
Put your hands up to the sound [2x]
Get up [9x]
Put your hands up to the sound, to the sound
Put your hands up! [4x]

Party rock is in the house tonight 
Everybody just have a good time 
And we gonna make you lose your mind 
Everybody just have a good good good time

Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up

Shake that!
