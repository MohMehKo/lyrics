Rock me away
I don't know what I see in your eyes
If you want to rock, rock me baby
Rock me right
If you're gonna smoke, smoke me baby
Roll me tight

Way down low, way down low, you better go
Way down low, way down low, you'd better go
You'd better go, ohh

Girl's got me down, work's got me down
Nothing gets me up until that girl at work goes down...
Girls got me down, work's got me down
But nothing gets me up until that girl at work g-g-g-g-goes

Rock me baby, rock me right
Smoke me baby, roll me tight
Way down low, you'd better go
Way down low, way down low, you'd better go
