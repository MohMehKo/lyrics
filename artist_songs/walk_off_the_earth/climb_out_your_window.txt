You never hear it on the radio
You never see it in the video
They never play it at the disco
So watch out we play it everywhere to go
They try and change our ways
Our love, our faith, our home, our heads
We play it everywhere we go
We play it everywhere we go
Can't coming in the studio
You can't get it with the logo
You can't ride it at a rodeo
So watch out we ride it everywhere to go
Don't try and change our ways
Our love, our faith, our home, our heads
We play it everywhere we go

Wake up, wake up now, today
There's nowhere we can't go
Wake up, wake up now
Hey people, climb out your window
We sing it everywhere we go
We sing it everywhere we go
Wake up, wake up now
Let's go, climb out your window

You can eat it like an oreo
You can lay it like a domino
You can love it like a Romeo
Watch out, we love it everywhere we go
Come out we'll make out way, our love, 
our faith, our home, our heads
We play it everywhere we go

Wake up, wake up now, today
There's nowhere we can't go
Wake up, wake up now
Hey people, climb out your window
We sing it everywhere we go
We sing it everywhere we go
Wake up, wake up now
Let's go, climb out your window
Let's go it's time you climb out your window
Let's go it's time you climb out your window

You never hear it on the radio
Watch out we play it everywhere we go

Wake up, wake up now, today
There's nowhere we can't go
Wake up, wake up now
Hey people, climb out your window
We sing it everywhere we go
We sing it everywhere we go
Wake up, wake up now
Let's go, climb out your window
Let's go it's time you climb out your window
Let's go it's time you climb out your window
