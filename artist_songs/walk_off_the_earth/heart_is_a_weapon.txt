First hit, cool like shit, thought you were it
I was blinded by flawless
Things got a sticky yeah
And they got a tricky one
Same shot, thinking of the block
Got your eyes on my knot
Watch my cat on the night drop
Things got a lot sticky yeah
Cause I know you were a tricky one

I wished somebody told me
Your heart is a weapon
It cuts like a sword
Your heart is a weapon
Can't take it anymore!
Change your direction
Stop banging at my door
Your heart is a weapon
Can't take it anymore

Please stacks out, what you're all about
Believe you from the now that you'll never come back
Did you get your super-mission for?
So you'd better take a little rough
You're tryina twist like a twistler
I smoke you out like a twizzler
Though the situation's critical
So you'd better take a little rough

I wished somebody told me
Your heart is a weapon
It cuts like a sword
Your heart is a weapon
Can't take it anymore!
Change your direction
Stop banging at my door
Your heart is a weapon
Can't take it anymore

Oh, she's a devil
Swims you in circles
You look like its level
But when you descent her
She boils your blood
She blows all your whistles like candles
Like struggle, she used to be numb
But now she causes you trouble
Somehow you unbuckle
She makes you to dare, but you're the devil

Your heart is a weapon
It cuts like a sword
Your heart is a weapon
Can't take it anymore
Change your direction
Stop banging at my door
Your heart is a weapon
Can't take it anymore
Your heart is a weapon
It cuts like a sword
Your heart is a weapon
Can't take it anymore
Change your direction
Stop banging at my door
Your heart is a weapon
Can't take it anymore
