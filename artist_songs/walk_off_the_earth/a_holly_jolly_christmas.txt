Have a Holly Jolly Christmas!
It's the best time of the year.
I don't know if there'll be snow
but have a cup of cheer.

Have a Holly Jolly Christmas!
And when you walk down the street,
say Hello to friends you know
and everyone you meet.

Ho Ho, the mistletoe
hung where you can see,
somebody waits for you,
kiss her once for me!

Have a Holly Jolly Christmas,
and in case you didn't hear.
Oh by golly
have a Holly Jolly Christmas this year!
