That CD in your place
That poster on your wall
That label on your face
But it don't bother you at all

You sold out for that tree
And I'm playing here for free
I'm playing here for free

Just a picture on my wall
(And it's coming down)
I'm not loving you at all
(And I'm coming down)
[x2]

That movement in your feet,
That swagger in your hips,
I've seen this sh*t before,
It's when your music finally slips

You sold out for that tree
And I'm playing here for free
I'm playing here for free

Just a picture on my wall
(And it's coming down)
I'm not loving you at all
(And I'm coming down)
[x2]

Just a picture on my wall
(And I'm coming down)
[x4]

Just a picture on my wall
(And it's coming down)
I'm not loving you at all
(And I'm coming down)
[x2]

Just a picture on my wall
(And I'm coming down)
[x4]
