From the day of birth
As we walk off the earth
Lion style
It's the Dogg, yo
We gon' put somethin' in the air one time
Summa dat sticky icky icky

Put your lighters up!
Get high with me, fly with me, ain't no dividin' us
Eastside, Westside, Northside, Southside
Unified, come on and ride with us
Lighters up!
Get high with me, fly with me, ain't no dividin' us
Eastside, Westside, Northside, Southside
Unified! (High!)

Unison, we come together
Undivided, brave the weather
My team is tough like leather
I got the people on my left
And they with me everyplace and step
My people on the west, got the best
Fillin' up my chest
All the mass of trouble's what'll keep us whole
Unity is vitamin for the soul
I sing the words of one love as applicable
You got to get up. Stand up. Spark up. Change the world!

Put your lighters up! (Change the world)
Get high with me, fly with me, ain't no dividin' us
Eastside, Westside, Northside, Southside
Unified, come on and ride with us
Lighters up! (LIGHTERS UP!)
Get high with me, fly with me, ain't no dividin' us

Ain't no denyin' I am swingin' off o' dem trees
My destiny, am I fresh to be?
And I best'd be on my bitch, yeah
Love and unity alone can get to me
Or if a girl, wanna meet me
So if you know a lot of love we spread put your lighter up
Hope to live a better day for Lion, get a brighter love
Ghetto yutes stop the war make no shots no buss
Buss a vato, make the cops turn up! Yeah!
