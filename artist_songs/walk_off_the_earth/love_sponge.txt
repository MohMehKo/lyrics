Lord you are lovable, kissable
Desire the inevitable
Without your sweet caress im so damn miserable
Touch your finesse, feel the fur of your coat
Seen you walk away saying my eyes in smoke
You are dressible, lookable
All the man dem after yuh
They claim you do something they just cant explain
To the brain
Your man shouldnt have no complain
Oh no

Hey slow motion is the way for us to enjoy the day
Always taking time to listen what she got to say
She thinks I be spending too much time on the beat
I try to make her overstand thats how we eat
Darling don't quarrel with me, It hurts too easily
Dont be messed up by silly tendency
No no way

She mek a caan forget about the huging and squeezing
Ah feel as if im upside down in the ceiling
Confess, this girl is the ultimate thing
What it means to be loved, no need asking
Swing baby swing, while I continue sing
Your favourite song
Let's go dancing
Hey, chuh
