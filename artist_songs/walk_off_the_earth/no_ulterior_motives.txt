No ulterior motives, all my focus on you
Well I can't hide the way I'm feeling girl
Who's kidding who, yeah

Well we just met but girl there's something that I like
I'll get right to the point, I will not waste your time, I said,
I'd like to get to know you inside out and backwards, then I'll know

I like your smile but I love the way you laugh
I keep on thinking that I know you from my past, I said,
I'm giving what you need
Well I should gain control but I can't stop thinking

Girl I wanna drink from your cup
You got me goin' girl, I can't get enough
Wanna taste you on my lips, girl I'm in lust
You got me goin', you got me goin'

No ulterior motives, all my focus on you
Well I can't hide the way I'm feeling girl
Who's kidding who, yeah

I like the way you talk, I love the words you choose
You keep surprising me with all your thoughts and views, I think,
Is she too good to be true?
Cause I don't think I ever met a girl like you

And I won't wait or waste your time
And I'll tell you what's on my mind
I need you and you need me
Well I am here to fulfill all your needs

Girl I wanna drink from your cup
You got me goin' girl, I can't get enough
Wanna taste you on my lips, girl I'm in lust
You got me goin', you got me goin'

No ulterior motives, all my focus on you
Well I can't hide the way I'm feeling girl
Who's kidding who
