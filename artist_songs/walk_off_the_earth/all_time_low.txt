[Ryan Marshall:]
I was the knight in shining armor in your movie
Would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me
You're the reason I'm alone and masturbate

[Ryan Marshall & Sarah Blackwood:]
I (I, I), I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie I tried to hide
But now you know it

[Ryan Marshall:]
That I'm at an all time
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

[Gianni Luminati & Sarah Blackwood:]
I was the prototype like 3 Stacks on that CD
An example of the perfect candidate
Now all your girlfriends say that you don't want to see me
You're the reason that I just can't concentrate

[Gianni Luminati & Sarah Blackwood:]
I (I, I), I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie I tried to hide
But now you know it

[Gianni Luminati:]
That I'm at an all time
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

[Sarah Blackwood:]
I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie, lie, l-lie and try to hide
But now you know it
That I'm at an all time
Low, low, low, low, low, low-low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low-low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low
Lie, l-lie, I try to hide
But now you know it
That I'm at an all time...

LOW
LOW
LIE, Lie, l-lie I tried to hide
But now you know it
That I am at an all time low
That I am at an all time low
That I am at an all time low
That I am at an all time low
That I am at an all time low
That I am at an all time low
That I am at an all time
