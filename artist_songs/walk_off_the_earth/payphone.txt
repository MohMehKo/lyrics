I'm at a payphone tryin' to call home
All of my change I've spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

Yeh, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me

You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in the time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now, I'm paralysed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in Paradise

I'm at a payphone tryin' to call home
All of my change I've spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If 'happy ever after' did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fuckin' love song, I'll be sick
Yeahhhh, yeh

You turn your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away

You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralysed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in Paradise

I'm at a payphone tryin' to call home
All of my change I've spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If 'happy ever after' did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fuckin' love song, I'll be sick
Yeahhhh, yeh

Man, fuck that shit
I'm pretty sure that payphones don't even exist
When I was trying to call home
You were leavin' me alone in Bliss
You should change the words in the song
Let these people know all the shit you did wrong!
Listen boy I ain't gonna answer the phone
So, you can leave a message after the tone
Beeeeep!

I'm at a payphone tryin' to call home
All of my change I spent on you

If 'happy ever after' did exist

All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fuckin' love song, I'll be sick

Now, I'm at a payphone
