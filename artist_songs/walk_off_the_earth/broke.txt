I've been broke
I've been broke

I could drop a piece of sand
Portray a different man
Bring peace across the land
Give souls to all the damned

But you kick me when I'm down
Throw stones when I'm around
A jester for your crown
In this fallacy I've found

I've been broke throughout these shades of grey
I've been broke throughout these shades of grey

Yeah you don't know about my friends
You may have to worry
'Cause then I'm full pretend
Yeah you don't know about my friends
You may have to worry
And

I could drop a piece of sand
Portray a different man
Bring peace across the land
Give souls to all the damned

I say fuck to Uncle Sam
Say fuck to contraband
'Cause we never took Japan
It's a fallacy of man

I've been broke throughout these shades of grey
I've been broke throughout these shades of grey

Through all
All these shades
Through all
All these shades

Yeah you don't know about my friends
You may have to worry
'Cause then I'm full pretend
Yeah you don't know about my friends
You may have to worry
Don't make this world

Yeah you don't know about my friends
You may have to worry
'Cause then I'm full pretend
Yeah you don't know about my friends
You may have to worry
Don't make this world
And

I could drop a piece of sand
Portray a different man
Bring peace across the land
Give souls to all the damned

But you kick me when I'm down
Throw stones when I'm around
A jester for your crown
In this fallacy I've found

I've been broke throughout these shades of grey
I've been broke throughout these shades of grey
I've been broke throughout these shades of grey

I've been broke throughout these shades of grey
(And now my life is saved)
I've been broke throughout these shades of grey
(And now my soul is saved)

I've been broke
