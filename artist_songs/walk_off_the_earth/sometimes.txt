If only you could love me sometimes
We'd rule the world together sometimes
You know we'd fight forever sometimes
And end our wars together sometimes

You're at the top of my list
Higher than milk and eggs
Higher than Huey's fist
You keep my temperature hot
Like I was feverish
I'm not a business man,
But let's do business, chick
I'm like a ceiling fan,
I keep you cool 'n sh*t.
I dismiss promiscuous misses
like Jehovah Witness does to Christmas

Together as one, our lives are the wickedest
Apart, our lives are hideous

If only you could love me sometimes
We'd rule the world together sometimes
You know we'd fight forever sometimes
And end our wars together sometimes
[x2]

I got you, I got you, boy

Sometimes the love tries to be the only friend to ya
It causes stress to ya, but gets you out of bed like a rooster
Like a rooster - cut!
Forgetting all my worries like I'm high
You make me feel taller than the sky

Together as one, our lives are the wickedest
Apart, our lives are hideous

If only you could love me sometimes
We'd rule the world together sometimes
You know we'd fight forever sometimes
And end our wars together sometimes
[x2]

I got you, I got you, boy
Sometimes the love dies,
And that's the only end you see
But not for you and me,
I got you till the ending
If you call out in distress or need
I'll be there more than a Mormon marries

Together as one, our lives are the wickedest
Apart, our lives are hideous

If only you could love me sometimes
We'd rule the world together sometimes
You know we'd fight forever sometimes
And end our wars together sometimes
[x2]

I got you, I got you, boy
I got you, I got you, always.
