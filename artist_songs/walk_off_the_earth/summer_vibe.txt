Eh-oh, eh-oh, eh-oh bop bop away-o
Summer vibe, summer vibe

I'm looking for a summer vibe
Got me turning on the radio
I gotta kick these blues
Working all day
Trying to make pay
Wishing these clouds away
I want to feel the sunshine
Hit the sand
Take a walk in the waves
With nothing else to do
But sipping on suds
Working on a buzz
Keeping my drink in the shade
Taking my time

With you by my side
A Cadillac ride
Jammin' with the boys
Bonfire at night
Summer vibe
Looking for a summer vibe
I paid my dues
Got nothing to prove
Laying on the dock
Just talking to you
Summer vibe
Looking for a summer vibe

I'm Jonesing for a good time
Hitting beaches all down the coast
I'll find a place to post
Gonna somehow
Find a luau
Dance this old night away
I'm drinking something blue from a coconut
Music all up in the place
Under the moonlight
Taking my time

With you by my side
A Cadillac ride
Jammin' with the boys
Bonfire at night
Summer vibe
Looking for a summer vibe
I paid my dues
Got nothing to prove
Laying on the dock
Just talking to you
Summer vibe
Looking for a summer vibe

And the sun goes down
But it'll rise again tomorrow
Ohâ€¦
Eh-oh, eh-oh, eh-oh bop bop away-o

With you by my side
A Cadillac ride
Jammin' with the boys
Bonfire at night
Summer vibe
Looking for a summer vibe
I paid my dues
Got nothing to prove
Laying on the dock
Just talking to you
Summer vibe
Looking for a summer vibe

Eh-oh, eh-oh, eh-oh bop bop away-o
Summer vibe, summer vibe
Eh-oh, eh-oh, eh-oh bop bop away-o
Summer vibe
