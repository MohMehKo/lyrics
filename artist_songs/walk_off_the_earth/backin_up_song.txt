I'm backin' up, backin' up, backin' up, backin' up
Cause my daddy taught me good
I'm backin' the hell outta there
And I'm like oh my God, oh my God, my God

I'm backin' up, backin' up, backin' up, backin' up
Cause my daddy taught me good
And I think maybe I should faint. But I don't. (NO.)
My daddy taught me good.

I was putting one more type of coffee in my coffee cup
And outta the corner of my eyes I saw two guys come in
One with a black hoodie, one with a white hoodie.
Black hoodie. (White hoodie!)
White hoodie. (Black hoodie!)

They said, "WE WANT YOUR MONEY EVERYBODY DOWN!"
And I'm like, "Oh UGH! Why did I need coffee now?!"
And soooooo
The guy in black starts comin' down,
comin' down down down down

I'm backin' up, backin' up, backin' up, backin' up
Cause my daddy taught me good
I'm backin' the hell outta there
And I'm like oh my God, oh my God, my God

I'm backin' up, backin' up, backin' up, backin' up
Cause my daddy taught me good
And I think maybe I should faint. But I don't. (NO.)
My daddy taught me good.

So I backed farther and farther away,
And I'm like, don't look don't look don't look.
And he comes right to me and he goes,
Get down now! Get down now!
And I just drop to my knee,
see my little knee.

And, and then when I figure I'm safe
I'm like, countin' to two thousand.
And I don't hear nothin'â€¦ Nothin!
Then I hear:
BOOM BOOM BOOM!
I'm like, Ohhhmigod they're dead!

I'm backin' up, backin' up, backin' up, backin' up
Cause my daddy taught me good
I'm backin' the hell outta there
And I'm like oh my God, oh my God, my God

I'm backin' up, backin' up, backin' up, backin' up
Cause my daddy taught me good
And I think maybe I should faint. But I don't. (NO.)
My daddy taught me good.

And I'm like I'm gonna have to find all my friends dead,
And then they were laughing (ha ha),
They shot the robber!

Hero of the day, saved my life, saved my life!
They shot the robber!
Hero of the day, saved my life.
Hero of the day, saved my life, saved my life!
They shot the robber!
Hero of the day, saved my life.
Mi amigos, he's a hero.

I'm backin' up, backin' up, backin' up, backin' up
Cause my daddy taught me good
I'm backin' the hell outta there
And I'm like oh my God, oh my God, my God
I'm backin' up, backin' up, backin' up, backin' up
Cause my daddy taught me good
And I think maybe I should faint. But I don't. (NO.)
My daddy taught me good.
