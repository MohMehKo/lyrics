I'm taking time to live my life
Nothing's been changing
everyone's saying
"My tune make you feel alright,
cause I've got somethin everyone's chasing."

I know you've heard it all before
small town man tryin to make a big stand.
My friends say

I gotta make this right but I'm makin it hard cause.
Just tryin to lay low (low, a little bit harder, little bit),
lay low (low, a little bit harder).
Just tryin to lay low (low, a little bit harder, little bit),
lay low (low, a little bit harder).

It's late night the tune feels right,
familiar faces,
nothin needs changing.
The melody and the beat's so tight,
a dozen face and we drop it the bass in.

a small town man tryin to make a big stand.

Just tryin to lay low (low, a little bit harder, little bit),
lay low (low, a little bit harder).
Just tryin to lay low (low, a little bit harder, little bit),
lay low (low, a little bit harder).

The sun will shine,
and rain will fall.
The fire burns inside us all.

Just tryin to lay low.

I know you've heard it all before,
a small town man tryin to make a big stand.
My friends say, "you gotta make this right,"
so I'm bringin it harder (just tryin to lay low).
