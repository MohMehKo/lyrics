Two steps forward, one step back
With you on my shoulders it's not fast
But I will get there someday
Might be slower, but we'll have stories
When we're older!
Hard days, but we got one another!

That's the thing about us
We got love love love
That's the thing about us
We got love love love
If you think you might break,
If you think you might fall
If you think you've got nothing at all
But you got us, we got love love love
Oh, we got love love love

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

We've got questions that don't have answers
We tell our tales and we talk for hours
Ain't that something you hold on to?
That some few days at the end of summer
Hard days, but we got one another!

That's the thing about us
We got love love love
That's the thing about us
We got love love love
If you think you might break,
If you think you might fall
If you think you've got nothing at all
But you got us, we got love love love
Yeah we got love
Na na na na na na
Yeah we got love
Na na na na na na

With time goes by, it makes it hard to see
Hearts get broken like fairy dreams
But if we'll try I know that you'll agree
Our love is something that can change the world

That's the thing about us
We got love love love
That's the thing about us
We got love love love
If you think you might break,
If you think you might fall,
If you think you've got nothing at all
But you got us, you got love love love
I only got love

Na na na na na na
Yeah, we got love
Na na na na na na
That's the thing about us
Na na na na na na
We got love
Na na na na na na
You and me,
Na na na na na na
That's the thing about us
Na na na na na na
We got love
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
