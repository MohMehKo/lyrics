[x2:]
One day baby we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
Think of all the stories that we could've told

No more tears, my heart is dry
I don't laugh and I don't cry
Don't think about you all the time
But when I do, I wonder why

Had to go out of my door
Leave just like you did before
I know I said that I was sure
But rich man can't imagine poor

[x5:]
One day baby we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
Think of all the stories that we could've told

One day baby we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old

One day baby we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
Think of all the stories that we could've told

One day baby we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old

Little me and little you
Kept doing all the things we do
They'd never really think it through
Like I can never think it true

Here I go again the flame
The guilt, the pain, the hurt, the shame
The founding fathers of our plane
That's stuck in heavy clouds of rain

One day baby we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
Think of all the stories that we could've told

One day baby we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old

[x2:]
One day baby we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
Think of all the stories that we could've told
