I used to write on cocaine
I used to ride with marilyn
I used to rock n roll with all the ones you know
But now I suffer from all my sins

I know I'll see you around
Must've been back in my hometown

Your love was all that I asked for
But it was blowin in the wind
Diamonds and rust turn lonelyness to lust
But now I suffer from all my sins

I know I'll see you around
Maybe back in your hometown
And if I go drive through there 
I know I'll see you standin with your long brown hair

I know I'll see you around
Maybe back in your hometown
And if I go drive through there 
I know I'll see you standin with your long brown hair

Your love was all that I asked for
But it was blowin in the wind
Diamonds and rust turn lonelyness to lust
But now I suffer from all my sins

Now I suffer from all my sins
Now I suffer from all my sins...
