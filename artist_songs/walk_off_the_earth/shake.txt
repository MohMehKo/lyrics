It's getting darker, darker than a coal mine
I'm feeling broken, broken like the street lines
So what about it, maybe we should get high
Cause all I need is temporary sunlight

A remedy to take away the pain

You gotta shake, shake, shake it outta me!
We gotta fuck with the laws of gravity!
You gotta shake, shake, shake it out of me!
Oh oh ohhh, shake!
Oh oh ohhh, shake!

I'm sinking deeper, faster than an anchor
I'm moving slower, crawling like a cancer
If I could cut through, graceful like a dancer
I'd find the core and strike it with a hammer

A panacea, take away the pain

You gotta shake, shake, shake it outta me!
We gotta fuck with the laws of gravity!
You gotta shake, shake, shake it out of me!
Oh oh ohhh, shake!
Oh oh ohhh, shake!

When I see the sun, when I see the sun
That'll be the day, the darkness goes away
When I see the sun, when I see the sun
That'll be the day

You gotta shake, shake, shake it outta me!
We gotta fuck with the laws of gravity!
You gotta shake, shake, shake it out of me!
Oh oh ohhh, shake!

I gotta run this rage right outta me!
I gotta run this rage right outta me!
You gotta shake, shake, shake it outta me!
Oh oh ohhh, shake!
Oh oh ohhh, shake!
