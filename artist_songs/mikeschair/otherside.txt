I've medicated lies for far too long
I've been living in a place that's not my home

Ive painted layer on layer to cover it all
But just a taste of your glory is never enough
Just a taste of your glory is never enough

Cause I want to live on the otherside
I want to live on the otherside
I want to live on the otherside
And swim in the Jordan

With an eye to the heavens
I've been counting the days
Impatiently waiting preparing the way

And when I finally see you, your face in the clouds
I'll hear the tongues of the nations, singing aloud
I'll hear the tongues of the nations, singing aloud

Cause I want to live on the otherside
I want to live on the otherside
I want to live on the otherside

I can feel it washing over
I can feel it washing over, over me
