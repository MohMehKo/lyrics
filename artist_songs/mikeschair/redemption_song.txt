People are singing in the streets
Singing a timeless melody
Of how love came down, the lost were found
Here the sound of Christmas
Come celebrate the King

Everyone sing along
This is our redemption song
Love has come, love has come to save us (to save us)
Emmanuel, is here now
Go and tell the broken hearted
Love has come, love has come to save us
So sing along

(Hallelujah) This is our redemption song
(Hallelujah) Yeah!

This is the time to stop the noise
Lay down your burdens, lift your voice
And praise this Son, the Holy One, who rescued us
It's Christmas let the world rejoice!

Everyone sing along
This is our redemption song
Love has come, love has come to save us (to save us)
Emmanuel, is here now
Go and tell the broken hearted
Love has come, love has come to save us
So sing along

(Hallelujah) This is our redemption song
(Hallelujah) Yeah!

(Hallelujah) Emmanuel
(Hallelujah) He is with us
(Hallelujah) Emmanuel
(Hallelujah) Ooooohhh!

Everyone sing along
This is our redemption song
Love has come, love has come to save us (to save us)

(Hallelujah) This is our redemption song
(Hallelujah) Yeah!
