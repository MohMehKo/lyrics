I've got the strength to walk a thousand miles
I'm not gonna stop till I reach You
You give me peace when the storm keeps ragin' strong
I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on

You're pullin' me, You're pullin' me, oh, oh
You're pullin' me, You're pullin' me straight to Your heart
Straight to Your heart, straight to Your heart, straight to Your heart
Oh, oh, woah, You're pullin' me, oh, oh, woah

I feel Your love push me forward as the wind pushes back
I'm not gonna stop till I reach You
I'll do whatever it takes, no, I'm not gonna break
I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on

You're pullin' me, You're pullin' me, oh, oh
You're pullin' me, You're pullin' me straight to Your heart
Straight to Your heart, straight to Your heart, straight to Your heart
Oh, oh, woah, You're pullin' me, oh, oh, woah

Pullin' me, oh, oh, pullin' me, oh, oh
Pullin' me, oh, oh, pullin' me, oh, oh
Woah, woah, oh, woah, woah

Straight to Your heart, straight to Your heart
Straight to Your heart, straight to Your heart
Oh, oh, woah, You're pullin' me, oh, oh, woah
