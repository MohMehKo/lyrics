With just a word night becomes the day
I hear Your voice and I'm forever changed
You bring my soul life

You tell me things I never knew before
And hold me close, I know that I am Yours
You've always been there
And You'll always be there
And that won't ever change

You have saved my life
Hallelujah
You set my heart on fire
And oh how it burns for You

In the dark I reach out for Your hand
You're waiting there to pick me up again
You never leave me

You come with hope, a love worth my pursuit
And now my heart only beats for you
You are the one I need
You'll always be the one for me
And that will never change

You have saved my life
Hallelujah
You set my heart on fire
And oh how it burns for You

You have saved my life
Hallelujah
You set my heart on fire
And oh how it burns for You

Hallelujah
Hallelujah, I sing
Hallelujah
Hallelujah, I sing
Hallelujah
Hallelujah, I sing
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

You have saved my life
Hallelujah
You set my heart on fire
And oh how it burns for You

You have saved my life
Hallelujah
You set my heart on fire
And oh how it burns for You
