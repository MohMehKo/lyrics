Something here is wrong
There are children without homes
But we just move along
To take care of our own

There's so much suffering
Just outside our door
A cry so deafening
Oh, we just can't ignore

To all the people who are fighting for the broken
All the people who keep holding onto love
All the people who are reaching for the lonely
Keep changing the world

Take a look around
Before the sun goes out
What's lost can still be found
It's not too late now

It only takes one spark
To make the fire burn
So reach inside your heart
And let this be the start

To all the people who are fighting for the broken
All the people who keep holding onto love
All the people who are reaching for the lonely
Keep changing the world

To all the people who are fighting for the broken
All the people who keep holding onto love
All the people who are reaching for the lonely
Keep changing the world

I see you changing the world, I see you changing the world
Every boy, every girl, step up, step up
I see you changing the world, I see you changing the world
Every boy, every girl, step up, step up

See the sun coming up, it's a brighter day
Share the world right now, it's a better way
So lend a hand, join the fight, 'cause time is ticking away
I'll keep changing the world

See the sun coming up, it's a brighter day
Share the world right now, it's a better way
So lend a hand, join the fight, 'cause time is ticking away
I'll keep changing the world

To all the people who are fighting for the broken
All the people who keep holding onto love
All the people who are reaching for the lonely
Keep changing the world

To all the people who are fighting for the broken
All the people who keep holding onto love
All the people who are reaching for the lonely
Keep changing the world

Keep changing the world
(I see you changing the world, I see you changing the world)
Keep changing the world
(I see you changing the world, I see you changing the world, step up)
