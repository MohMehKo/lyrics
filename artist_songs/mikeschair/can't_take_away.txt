All around
All of us
Fear has come and so we must
Ask ourselves
In who we trust
What we have here
Is not enough
So let it ring
In freedom sing

You can take away
Everything that I've been holding
You can take away the sun
You can take away the very air that I've been breathing
But you can't take away my God
Oh, my God, my God

Waves will come
And winds will blow
But it's not here I've found my hope
My beating heart
My weary soul
Is held by one who won't let go
And so I'll cling
To You my King

You can take away
Everything that I've been holding
You can take away the sun
You can take away the very air that I've been breathing
But you can't take away my God
Oh, my God, my God

A hope that can't be lost
A love that can't be bought
You can't take away my God
Nothing high or low
Nothing you can control
You can't take away my God

You can take away
Everything that I've been holding
You can take away the Sun
You can take away the very air that I've been breathing
But you can't take away my God

No you can't
No you can't
Take away my God
No you can't
No you can't
No you can't
Take away my God, Oh My God, My God.
