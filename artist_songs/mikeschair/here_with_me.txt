God, I'm desperate for a sign
That I'm not praying to the night sky
Let me know I'm not alone
That you will never let me go
'Cause everything I've held on to is slipping away

When my world is crashing down
Left in pieces on the ground
I will stand knowing you are here with me
With my hands reaching for the sky
I can feel you holding tight
I'm stepping out on water knowing you are
Here with me

You take the broken and the weak
And use them for your glory
So help me to believe
That you will do the same for me
When everything is going wrong
I will trust in you

[Chorus]
