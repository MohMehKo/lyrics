I'm not gonna let gravity hold me down, oh, oh, oh
I'm ready for my life to turn around, oh, oh, oh
Cause I've seen a greater love,
And nothing else can be enough
I'm gonna give everything I have,
And I'm not holding back!

[Chorus:]
All or nothing, I'm done wasting time
Love is calling me to be the light
I wanna shine in the light like a skyline
All or nothing, all or nothing, ohhh
All or nothing, all or nothing!

I'm gonna run this race till you say, well done!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Be the beat of my heart, and breath in my lungs
Oh, oh, oh,
Inside the fire burning bright
Inside of me like city lights
I'm gonna give everything I have,
And I'm not holding back!

[Chorus:]
All or nothing, I'm done wasting time
Love is calling me to be the light
I wanna shine in the light like a skyline
All or nothing, all or nothing, ohhh
All or nothing, all or nothing!

I wanna lose myself in graces ocean
Find my heart in your hands.
Every piece I give it over
Nothing else, you are everything I am!
Oh, oh, oh I am!

[Chorus:]
All or nothing, I'm done wasting time
Love is calling me to be the light
I wanna shine in the light like a skyline
All or nothing, all or nothing, ohhh
All or nothing, all or nothing!
