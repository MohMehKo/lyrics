I try to control my destiny; I wanna believe I know what I need
But I keep coming up empty
And now I see, I see the way it works, I hold on tight and then it burns
So I give it all to you, to you

[CHORUS]
The more I hold on, the more it all comes undone
The more I let go, I’m caught beneath your overflow
And there’s more of you, more of you, more of you

I’m not the fool I was before; I’m done with pushing down the doors
‘Cause I keep coming up empty
And now I see, I see the way it works, I’m letting go until it hurts
To find it all in you, in you

[CHORUS]

My all in all, be everything
You fill my cup beyond my dreams
My all in all, be everything
You fill my cup beyond my dreams, my dreams

[CHORUS]
