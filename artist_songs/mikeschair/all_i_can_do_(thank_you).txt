I could write a love song
Tell You what I think You wanna hear
But it wouldn't be good enough, no
Yea I could try so hard
To give it everything I've got
But I'm not ever gonna measure up

All I can do is thank You
For this life I never deserved
Wanna thank You for the grace
I know I don't have to earn
You love me, You love me
Your mercy is proof
All I can do is say thank You
All I can do is say thank You

It would have been easy
But I'm glad You never walked away
Cause Your love runs deep for me
And I see this beautiful world
And it brings tears to my eyes
And I think it's beautiful to be free

All I can do is thank You
For this life I never deserved
Wanna thank You for the grace
I know I don't have to earn
You love me, You love me
Your mercy is proof
All I can do is say thank You
All I can do is say thank You

(Thank You)
For hope, for love, for all the ways You move
(You)
For everything You do
(You)
What else can I say but thank You
Thank You

I could write a love song
Tell You what I think You wanna hear
But it wouldn't be good enough

All I can do is thank You
For this life I never deserved
Wanna thank You for the grace
I know I don't have to earn
You love me, You love me
Your mercy is proof
All I can do is say thank You
All I can do is say thank You

All I can do, all I can do, all I can do
Is say thank You
All I can do, all I can do, all I can do
Is say thank You
