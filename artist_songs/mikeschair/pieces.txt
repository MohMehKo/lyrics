Oh Ohh ohhhhh
In the starlight
The ground's shaking
And I don't know what to do
I try to run in
But I'm breaking
Will I ever make it through?
My pride, my weakness, the lies I tell
I still hide, my disguise can make me well

Will You tear my world apart, rebuild it completely?
Will You reach for my breaking heart and hold it together?
Lord, come make me new
I give the pieces to You

I never realized
What I was missing
When I had nothing to lose
Never lived life
'Til I listened
And I really heard the truth
Through my lies
Through the weakness
My pride fell
I can't hide my life
You know me too well

Will You tear my world apart, rebuild it completely?
Will You reach for my breaking heart and hold it together?
Lord, come make me new
I give the pieces to You

In Your hands
You're making me closer to free
And I believe
You put love in Your plans for me

You tear my world apart
Will You reach for my breaking heart, yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Will You tear my world apart, rebuild it completely?
Will You reach for my breaking heart, and hold it together?
Lord, come make me new
I give the pieces to You
Yeah
I give the pieces to You
Yeah
I give the pieces to You
To You
I give the pieces to You
To You
I give the pieces to You
