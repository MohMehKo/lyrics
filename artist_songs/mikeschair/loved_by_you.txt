Sometimes it's hard to believe
You're arms are open for me
That grace has set me free
And I'm a child of the king
I can't begin to describe
The joy I'm feelin' inside
Wanna let the whole world know
What it feels like

My heart is spoken for
God I am always yours
I can't escape the truth
It's so good to be loved by you

I'm never on my own
Forever yours alone
I can't escape the truth
It's so good to be loved by you (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
It's so good to be loved by you (oh oh oh oh oh oh)

Not just another face
Lost in a sea of names
There's not a single doubt
You know me inside out
I can't begin to describe
The way you're changing my life
Yeah I [?]
For the first time

My heart is spoken for
God I am always yours
I can't escape the truth
It's so good to be loved by you

I'm never on my own
Forever yours alone
I can't escape the truth
It's so good to be loved by you (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
It's so good to be loved by you (oh oh oh oh oh oh)

I'll take everyday and give it all away
It's just the least I can do
'Cause I'm loved by you
[X2]

My heart is spoken for
God I am always yours
I can't escape the truth
It's so good to be loved by you

I'm never on my own
Forever yours alone
I can't escape the truth
It's so good to be loved by you (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
It's so good to be loved by you (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh oh oh)
It's so good to be loved by you
