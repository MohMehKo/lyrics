You can feel it in the air
It's that time of year
The season we've been waiting for
Is finally here

Looks like the tree is
Covered in a million lights
And everyone is joyful
On this silent night this holy night

It's Christmas, reminds us of the promise
And His name is Jesus
Rejoice 'cause God is with us
It's Christmas

Every December we remind ourselves
Christ is come the sotry of Emmanuel
How Shepherds who were guided the starlight
Found a Savior in a manger
On a silent night a holy night

It's Christmas, reminds us of the promise
And His name is Jesus
Rejoice 'cause God is with us
It's Christmas

Let every weary, broken soul
Remember you are not alone
The Creator of the world is here

It's Christmas, reminds us of the promise
And His name is Jesus
Rejoice 'cause God is with us
It's Christmas
