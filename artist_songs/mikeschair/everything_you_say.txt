Words fly, bye bye
speaking lies about my life but I don't hear a thing
The world can't understand
try to tell me who I am but I'm not listening

No one can lay on me
all my identity

I'm hanging on everything You say
I go alive when You call my name
I know it's true when You say I'm saved
'cause I believe everything, e-everything You say
everything, e-everything You say
everything, e-everything You say
everything, e-everything You say
everything, e-everything You say

You've come bitters done 
I belong to the only one who has the right to me  

You bought me with Your life
so now I give You mine

I'm hanging on everything You say
I go alive when You call my name
I know it's true when You say I'm saved
'cause I believe everything, e-everything You say
everything, e-everything You say
everything, e-everything You say
everything, e-everything You say
everything, e-everything You say

[2x]
Set free, redeemed, I am everything that You call me
Holy, beloved, I am everything that You call me

I'm hanging on everything You say
I go alive when You call my name
I know it's true when You say I'm saved
'cause I believe everything, e-everything You say
everything, e-everything You say
everything, e-everything You say
everything, e-everything You say
everything, e-everything You say

everything, e-everything You say
everything, e-everything You say
everything, e-everything You say
everything, e-everything You say
