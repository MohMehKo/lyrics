This time, this place is set apart
I stand amazed at who You are
I'm overcome by what You've done
Oh

I'm here right now, I need You now
I lift Your name above the doubt
This is my offering for You
For You

'Cause it's all for You, all for You
Every heart will proclaim
Every tongue will shout Your praise
All for You, oh, oh, oh
All for You, oh, oh, oh

I leave my burden at Your feet
In You I find my victory
There is nothing You can't do
Oh

I'll live my life in Your renown
I'll give it all and lay it down
'Cause I owe everything to You
To You

'Cause it's all for You, all for You
Every heart will proclaim
Every tongue will shout Your praise
All for You, oh, oh, oh
All for You, oh, oh, oh

All will hear, all will see
Love came down and we are free
All will hear, all will see
Love came down and we are free

'Cause it's all for You, all for You
Every heart will proclaim
Every tongue will shout Your praise

All for You, all for You
Every heart will proclaim
Every tongue will shout Your praise

All for You, oh, oh, oh
(All will hear, all will see)
All for You, oh, oh, oh
(Love came down and we are free)

All will hear, all will see
Love came down and we are free
All will hear, all will see
Love came down and we are free

All will hear, all will see
Love came down and we are free
