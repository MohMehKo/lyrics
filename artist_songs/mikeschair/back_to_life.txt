I feel stuck in the life I'm living
There's so much I know that I am missing
Can you help me, can you help me?

Come on I need to breathe again
Come down and move me from where I've been
Reach inside and bring me back to life

I'm so tired of going through the motions
More empty words of devotion
Can I break free, can I break free?

Come on I need to breathe again
Come down and move me from where I've been
Reach inside and bring me back to life

I'm only half alive
without You in my life
Well, I'm only half alive
So bring me back

Come on I need to breathe again
Come down and move me from where I've been
Reach inside and bring me back to life

Come on I need to breathe again
Come down and move me from where I've been
Come on I need to breathe again
Come on Come on
Come down and move me from where I've been
Come on Come
