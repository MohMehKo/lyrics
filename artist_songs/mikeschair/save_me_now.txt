I couldn't see what I've become
I was blinded in my weakness
Feeling numb, too far gone
On my knees, you're all I'm seeking
Here at the bottom I can't help but lift my hands and look to you
Can you hold me where I am?

Come and save me now
I'm drowning on my own without you here
See me reaching out
I'm crying out to you
Lord draw me near
Save me now
I'm longing to be found
Only you can save me now

I'm done with living my own way
With every step, it's you whose leading
Do what it takes to walk by faith,
Even when my world is shaking
When the water's rising and it's hard to take a breath
I'll look to you, when I have nothing left

Come and save me now
I'm drowning on my own without you here
See me reaching out
I'm crying out to you
Lord draw me near
Save me now
I'm longing to be found
Only you can save me now

You heal the weak and broken
You break my heart wide open
Only you, yeah
You take the doubt and all my shame away

Come and save me now
I'm drowning on my own without you here
See me reaching out
I'm crying out to you
Lord draw me near

Save me now
I'm drowning on my own without you here
See me reaching out
I'm crying out to you
Lord draw me near

Save me now
I'm longing to be found
Only you can save me, can save me now
