Life is moving faster than I thought it would
So I close my eyes trying to slow down the world
But then I took my head from the pillow bed
I rub my eyes see a silhouette
See You standing there
I feel the sun touch on my skin
I watch the sky be born again
As if I'm right there
And its all for me

I can see
I can see
I can see You reaching out for me
I will sing
I will sing
That love has come to rescue me

When I woke up I heard Your voice echoing
Quietly reminding how You came to me
And how I took my head from the pillow bed
Of how I rubbed my eyes see a silhouette
See You standing there
I felt the sun touch on my skin
I watched the sky be born again
And I was there
And its all for me

I can see
I can see
I can see You reaching out for me
I will sing
I will sing
That love has come to rescue me

You never give up
You never give in
You never let go of what you promised
You never give up
You never give in
You never let go of what you promised

I can see
I can see
I can see You reaching out for me
I will sing
I will sing
That love has come to rescue me

That love has come to rescue me
That love has come to rescue me
