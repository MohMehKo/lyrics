This is our moment
This is our moment

Do you believe
Something is happening
That could change everything?
Can you see
More than the typical,
All of the miracles?

Let's open our eyes,
See outside of the lines,
Arms open wide.

Life is now,
This is our moment,
Hear the sound
Of hope that is calling.
No more waiting,
The door is open,
This is our...
This is our moment,
This is our moment.

We are free,
Free to be so much more,
Anything's possible right now.
What we need,
Everything we are not,
Found in a living God.

So let's open our eyes,
Draw outside of the lines,
Arms open wide,
Arms open wide.

Life is now,
This is our moment,
Hear the sound
Of hope that is calling.
No more waiting,
The door is open,
This is our...
This is our moment,
This is our moment.

To move, to reach
To rest, believe
To use our hands and feet.
To love, to change,
To live, to chase,
To give everything.

This is our moment,
This is our moment.

Life is now,
This is our moment,
Hear the sound
Of hope that is calling.
No more waiting,
The door is open,
This is our...
This is our moment,
This is our moment.
This is our moment,
This is our moment.

Do you believe
Something is happening
That could change everything?
