You won't accept all the things you can't see
You say a mind can't conceive
A beautiful creator
But in your heart you know, you know, you know

You can't fight the feeling
Running deep inside your soul
Just give in to healing, ohh
You can't fight the feeling
Of the lover of your soul
Of how He'll never let you go
You can't fight the feeling

You run away but you never get far
Wearing heavy bruises and scars
You try and hide but your eyes still show
You know, you know you know

You can't fight the feeling
Running deep inside your soul
Just give in to healing, ohh
You can't fight the feeling
Of the lover of your soul
And how He'll never let you go
You can't fight the feeling
You can't fight the feeling, ohh ohh ohh
You can't fight the feeling, ohh ohh ohh
Oh You can't fight the feeling, ohhh

You can't fight the feeling
Running deep inside your soul
Just give in to healing, ohh
You can't fight the feeling
Of the lover of your soul
Of how He'll never let you go
You can't fight the feeling
You can't fight
You can't fight
You can't fight
You can't fight the feeling
