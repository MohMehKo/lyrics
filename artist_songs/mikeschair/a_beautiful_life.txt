I want you to know, I’ve seen your wounded heart
You’re looking for hope, but it always feels so far
I want you to know that I made you who you are
And I can’t wait for you to see what tomorrow’s gonna bring

[CHORUS]
A beautiful life is unfolding before my eyes
Just like the sun will rise to fill the empty sky, so shine
Oh, your beautiful, oh, your beautiful, oh, your beautiful life

I want you to see that you’re the one I love
And I will complete the work that I’ve begun
Oh, could you believe that the best is yet to come?
And I can’t wait for you to hold what I already know

[CHORUS]
Oh, your beautiful, oh, your beautiful, oh, your beautiful life

If you could see what I see, you were made to rise
If you could see what I see, you were made to shine

[CHORUS]
Oh, your beautiful, oh, your beautiful, oh, your beautiful life
