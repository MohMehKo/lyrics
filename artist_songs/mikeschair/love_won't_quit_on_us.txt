You've been hurt and you're jaded
You're telling me that your faith is fading fast
You wonder what it's even worth

You've got doubts and I get it
'Cause I've been in the place you're living
Scared that love will only get you burned

Don't quit on love 'cause you're broken
Don't quit on hope, you're not hopeless
You know the sun will rise again
This is not the end, yeah

I know this complicated world gets you down
But don't give up, don't give up, don't quit on love
'Cause, oh, love won't quit on us
Oh, love won't quit on us

He's felt what you're feeling
Feeling like you'll only be defeated
If you choose to let Him in this time

But do you really wanna have control
When everything's telling you to let it go?
And give Him
Your plans, your dreams, your life

Don't quit on love 'cause you're broken
Don't quit on hope, you're not hopeless
You know the sun will rise again
This is not the end, yeah

I know this complicated world gets you down
But don't give up, don't give up, don't quit on love
'Cause, oh, love won't quit on us
Oh, love won't quit on us

Hold on, hold on, be strong, hope is coming for you
Hold on, hold on, don't stop believing
Don't quit on love
'Cause He won't quit on you, on you

Don't quit on love 'cause you're broken
Don't quit on hope, you're not hopeless
You know the sun will rise again
This is not the end, yeah

I know this complicated world gets you down
But don't give up, don't give up, don't quit on love
'Cause, oh, love won't quit on us
Oh, love won't quit on us
Oh, love won't quit on us
Oh, love won't quit on us
