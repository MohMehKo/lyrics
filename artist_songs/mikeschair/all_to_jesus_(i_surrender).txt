All to Jesus I surrender
All my life I live for you
Lead my heart to never wonder
In your presence I will stay

I surrender, I surrender
I will bless your holy name
I surrender, I surrender
I surrender all

All to Jesus I surrender
Humbly on my knees I bow
Worldly pleasures only hinder
Take me Jesus, take me now

I surrender, I surrender
I will bless your holy name
I surrender, I surrender
I surrender all

All my dreams, all my plans
All my hopes, all I am
All my dreams, all my plans
All my hopes, all I am

I surrender, I surrender
I will bless your holy name
I surrender, I surrender
I surrender all

I surrender all, all
All to Jesus I surrender
All
