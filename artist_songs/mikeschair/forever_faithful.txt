Oh, oh, oh
I'm trying hard to walk by faith
Cause on my own I'm lead astray
You always prove your faithfulness
But just as quick I forget.
So if I'm too scared to walk,
The road ahead show me who you are!
Remind me

[Chorus:]
Through every season changing, you'll still remain
Oh, oh, oh, forever faithful!
Time and time again you're counting to the end
Forever faithful!
Oh, oh, oh!

I'm finding lust in your promises
You'll be the strength in my weakness
I'm not alone, never on my own,
Now I can see clearly!
That I am never far from arms of love,
I am who you are, and I trust you!

[Chorus:]
Through every season changing, you'll still remain
Oh, oh, oh, forever faithful!
Time and time again you're counting to the end
Forever faithful!
Oh, oh, oh!

In death, in life,
Forever faithful
In death, in life,
Forever faithful
You'll be by my side,
When I walk through the fire
You are, you are forever faithful!
Forever faithful!

[Chorus:]
Through every season changing, you'll still remain
Oh, oh, oh, forever faithful!
Time and time again you're counting to the end
Forever faithful!
Oh, oh, oh!

You are, you are, you are forever faithful
You are, you are, you are forever faithful
