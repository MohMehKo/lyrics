What if I told you
What would you say
Would you stand by me
Would you walk away
What if my walls came down
And you saw everything

All of my weakness
All of my scars
All that I've hidden
Deep in my heart
For so long
And I'm scared to set it free

[Chorus]
Show me a life that's broken
Can be redeemed
Show me that you can handle my honesty
And help me to know
You'll never let go
Your love won't ever leave
Show me that grace was made
For people like me

You say I'm forgiven
Being restored
But it's hard to feel it here in this storm
Torn between who I've been and who I want to be

Ohhh
Jesus I need you
Need you to be
Hope in the darkness searching for me
All of this doubt
Lord, help me to believe

[Chorus]

Oh my weak heart
And your strong arms
Give me faith when mine is gone
Help me trust in
Your mercy can set free
People like me

Show your arms are open
Your blood redeems
Show me that you can love
Even me

[Chorus]

...For people like me, Yeah
