There's no making sense of you, I can't explain it
How do you love the way you do and never change it
You are good, you are strong, you are everything I'm not
You are hope, you are love and your mercy never stops

[Chorus:]
How many times have you been faithful,
and How many times have you carried me
I run, I fight, I try to hide
But you stay here by my side
You carry me still no matter how many times

You are my god when I was lost deep in the shadows
And I've been yours all along so I will follow
Every step that you take, every move you wanna make
In my heart, in my life, oh I'm not afraid

[Chorus]

You know who I am, still you love me
And I don't your arms holding on to me, you carry me

[Chorus]
