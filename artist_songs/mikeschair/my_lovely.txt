Lonely you were, when I called your name
Tempted you were, when I saw your shame
See how I rescued you, see how I reach for you now

Homeless you were, when I sheltered you
Naked you were, when I covered you
See how I ransomed you, see my delight in you now

So come, so come, so come, so come

Come as you are, come as you are my lovely 
I'm not very far, I'm not very far
[x2]

So come, so come, so come, so come

Come as you are, come as you are my lovely 
I'm not very far, I'm not very far
[x3]

I'm not very far...

Homeless you were, when I sheltered you
Naked you were, when I covered you
See how I ransomed you, see my delight in you now
