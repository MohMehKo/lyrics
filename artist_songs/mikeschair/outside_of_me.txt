Give me something meaningful to say
Give me something wonderful to give
Give me something beautiful to sing, yeah
Give me something, something outside of me

All I need is You
All I need is You
All I need is something outside of me

Give me something meaningful to want
Give me something wonderful to love
Give me something beautiful to see
And give me something, something outside of me

All I need is You
All I need is You
All I need is something outside of me

All I need is You
All I need is You
All I need is something outside of me

'Cuz your words give life when my own won't fly
You offer love when my own runs dry
You open blinded eyes
To behold what I can't describe

All I need is You
All I need is You
All I need is something outside of me

All I need is You
All I need is You
All I need is something outside of me

Give me something meaningful to say ...
