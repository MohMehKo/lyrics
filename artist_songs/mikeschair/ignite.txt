Ignite a heart that's burning for You
Come change my point of view
And draw me closer, draw me closer

Revive a soul that's yearning for You
Filled with passion for Your truth
It's pouring over, pouring over

We're coming alive
We're coming alive with our hands in the sky
Then our voices unite singing whoa, oh
Can you hear us tonight with the fire inside
Let our blazes ignite, singing whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

Refine the plans I made for my life
The dreams I've kept inside
I give them over, give them over

To start over again with everything I am
I'm reaching for Your hand
I'm desperate for You, desperate for You

We're coming alive
We're coming alive with our hands in the sky
When our voices unite singing whoa, oh
Can you hear us tonight with a fire inside
Let our blazes ignite, singing whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

Ignite my heart, come draw me close
Revive my soul until it's pouring over
Refine my mind
Refine my life

We're coming alive
And can You hear us tonight?

We're coming alive with our hands in the sky
When our voices unite singing whoa, oh
Can You hear us tonight with a fire inside
Let our blazes ignite, singing whoa, oh, oh

We're coming alive with our hands in the sky
Then our voices unite singing whoa, oh
Can You hear us tonight with a fire inside
Let our blazes ignite, singing whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
