Oh, the night is dark and the road is hard
Lord, my heavy heart is about to break!
I'm face to face with a need for faith
Give me eyes to see past today.

[Chorus:]
Cause it's no easy out
Gravity hurts when I get knocked out
Don't need to know why,
You give me the faith
To know you're on time,
Not a second late!
So I can wait, I can wait,
I can wait,
You're right on time, not a second late!
I can wait!

Lead me by your truth that will never move
Cause I need a light that will never fade (that will never fade!)
The Lord true plans are for me
Even when I can see the whole story
Give me lies to see past today!

[Chorus:]
Cause it's no easy out
Gravity hurts when I get knocked out
Don't need to know why,
You give me the faith
To know you're on time,
Not a second late!
So I can wait, I can wait,
I can wait,
You're right on time, not a second late!
I can wait!

Through the fire, through the wind
Through the joy, through the pain
Give me all, I can't wait
Cause nearby your love remains.

[Chorus:]
You see, is no easy way out
Gravity hurts when I get knocked out
Don't need to know why,
You give me the faith
To know you're on time,
Not a second late!
So I can wait, I can wait!
I can wait,
You're right on time, not a second late!
I can wait!
