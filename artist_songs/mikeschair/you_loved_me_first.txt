Was it my broken heart that led me straight to You?
Was it your broken hands that I cannot refuse?
Was it my emptiness or was it Your empty tomb?
That pointed me home, pointed me home to You

I should've known all along, You're the one who loved me first
And if I had to save myself, this never would've worked
I wouldn't be in Your arms, I wouldn't know where to start
But You gave Your life to prove to me what I was worth
You loved me first

You were pursuing me, before the world began
Before there was anything, I was in Your plan
What did You see in me? Help me understand
The depth of your grace, God, I'm amazed, God, I'm amazed

I should've known all along, You're the one who loved me first
And if I had to save myself, this never would've worked
I wouldn't be in Your arms, I wouldn't know where to start
But You gave Your life to prove to me what I was worth
And You loved me

When I was wandering, when I was hiding
Jesus, You found me and You loved me first
God of all mercy, take all the glory
Jesus, you found me and You loved me first
And You loved me first

I should've known all along, You're the one who loved me first
And if I had to save myself, this never would've worked
I wouldn't be in Your arms, I wouldn't know where to start
But You gave Your life to prove to me what I was worth
You gave Your life to prove to me what I was worth
You loved me first, oh, You loved me first, yeah, yeah

You loved me first
