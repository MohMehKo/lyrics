You might be the wife waiting up at night
You might be the man struggling to provide
Feeling like it's hopeless

Maybe you're the son who chose a broken road
Maybe you're the girl thinking you'll end up alone
Praying God, can You hear me?
Oh, God, are You listening?

Am I more than flesh and bone?
Am I really something beautiful?
Yeah, I wanna believe
I wanna believe that

I'm not just some wandering soul
That You don't see and You don't know
Yeah, I wanna believe, Jesus, help me believe
That I am someone worth dying for

I know you've heard the truth that God has set you free
But you think you're the one that grace could never reach
So you just keep asking
Oh, what everybody's asking

Am I more than flesh and bone?
Am I really something beautiful?
Yeah I wanna believe
I wanna believe that

That I'm not just some wandering soul
That You don't see and You don't know
Yeah, I wanna believe, Jesus, help me believe
That I am someone worth dying for

You're worth it, you can't earn it
Yeah, the cross has proven
That You're sacred and blameless
Your life has purpose

You are more than flesh and bone
Can't you see, you're something beautiful?
Yes, you gotta believe, you gotta believe
He wants you to see, He wants you to see

That you're not just some wandering soul
That can't be seen and can't be known
Yeah, you gotta believe, you gotta believe that you are
Someone worth dying for, oh

You're someone worth dying for, oh
You're someone worth dying for
