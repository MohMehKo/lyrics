Life can be so hard
Leave the deepest scars
Life can break your heart
No matter who you are

In such a fallen place, so in need of grace
Waiting for that day
When light breaks the dark
Your light will break the dark

We're gonna see a day
When no more lives are getting broken
We're gonna see You take our pain
And throw it in the ocean

Every lonely heart, all this sorrow
Fading away
We're gonna see Your love come
Wash it away
We're gonna see Your kingdom

We are busted souls
Longing to be whole
Every part of us
Holding on to hope

The day when tears are gone
And we have overcome
And You'll come back to us
And take us home

And when You take us home

We're gonna see a day
When no more lives are getting broken
We're gonna see You take our pain
And throw it in the ocean

Every lonely heart, all this sorrow
Fading away
We're gonna see Your love come
Wash it away
We're gonna see Your kingdom

And Your creation whole
You can see it in the often sighs
Hearing them in lonely cry

And Your creation whole
And You're coming back for us
You're coming back for us
To take us home

We're gonna see a day
When no more lives are getting broken
Gonna see You take our pain
And throw it in the ocean

Every lonely heart, all this sorrow
Fading away
We're gonna see Your love come
Wash it away
We're gonna see Your kingdom

Oh, oh
We're gonna see
Oh, oh
We're gonna see Your kingdom

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
