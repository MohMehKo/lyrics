Standing still
The world shuts down
I can hear your voice much louder now
You feel so close
To where I am
Like a river slowly rushing in

[Chorus]
You come alive and we're here together
You come alive and I know you never left
You're right here beside me
You come alive in this very moment
I close my eyes and almost see your face
I can feel you come alive

Things you've done
Words you've said
How easily how just forget
I tried to be so strong
On my own
But when I let my walls come crashing down
Crashing down

[Chorus]
You come alive and we're here together
You come alive and I know you never left
You're right here beside me
You come alive in this very moment
I close my eyes and almost see your face
I can feel you come alive

[Bridge]
When I need your love the most
You can hear me
You can hear me
Oh I can feel you

[Chorus x2]
You come alive and we're here together
You come alive and I know you never left
You're right here beside me
You come alive in this very moment
I close my eyes and almost see your face
I can feel you come alive

Standing still
The world shuts down
