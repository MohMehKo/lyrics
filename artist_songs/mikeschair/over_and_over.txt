Over and over I've said I'll follow you till the end
Only to turn and walk away from your hand
I've been the runaway, I've been the runner straight
I've been so desperate for grace, yeah!

[Chorus:]
Over and over, you call my name
Would you, over and over, love me the same?
Even when I break your heart, you show me open arms
Pulling me closer, over and over

This feeling I've never known, this love awaking my soul
That you would look at me and call me your own
You've been so faithful, the only one who's able
To turn my broken in whole

[Chorus:]
Over and over, you call my name
Would you, over and over, love me the same?
Even when I break your heart, you show me open arms
Pulling me closer, over and over

[x2]
You are good, you are good, you are savior
Got over, got over, my own daemon

[Chorus:]
Over and over, you call my name
Would you, over and over, love me the same?
Even when I break your heart, you show me open arms
Pulling me closer, over and over
