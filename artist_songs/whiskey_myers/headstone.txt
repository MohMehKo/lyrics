Every morning and every night I prepare for what I do
Every morning say every night nothing ever reins true
Every morning and every night it ain’t gonna change
From the crack of dawn to the break of day
Till they lay me in my grave

Wild as a cyclone
I’m smoother than homegrown
Short lived and long gone
Chiseled on my headstone

Every morning and every night I prepare for what I do
Every morning say every night I end up black and blue
Every morning and every night got no one left to blame
From the dirt floor dives to the lows and highs
I’ll always be the same

Wild as a cyclone
I’m smoother than homegrown
Short lived and long gone
Chiseled on my headstone

I’m a bad man
I guess that’s something that will never change
Blood shot eyes and twisted lies
I got one foot in the grave

I’m a bad man
I guess that’s something that will never change
That way I’m feeling right now
I got both feet in the grave

I’m a bad man
Guess I better get on my knees and pray
Because it won’t be long
No it won’t be long
Till I’m 6 feet in the grave

Wild as a cyclone
I’m smoother than homegrown
Short lived and long gone
Chiseled on my headstone

Wild as a cyclone
I’m smoother than homegrown
Short lived and long gone
Chiseled on my headstone

Chiseled on my headstone
