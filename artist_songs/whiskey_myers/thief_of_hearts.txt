Well I was a bad boy
Who thought I'd been around
I was a madman
Who'd been from town to town
It was a good girl
That brought me down to size
She was a devil
In a soft southern sky
She drove me crazy
Damn near drove me insane
One touch to your lips
I bet she'd do the same

& she said she'd never go away
But she haunts me til today

She was the finest damn thing that I'd ever seen
Standin right there in her cowgirl jeans
A genuine dixie belle comin at me with a rebel yell
& oohwee cold as ice
Thought I'd take a chance cause she looked kinda nice don't ya know that looks can deceive
She had a hold of me

She had me twisted
Trapped inside a web
With those lies of passion
That spun right thru my head
Just like a cold chill
On a hot summer day
She was the poison
That'd swim right thru my veins

& she said she'd never go away
But she haunts me til today

She was the finest damn thing that I'd ever seen
Standin right there in her cowgirl jeans
A genuine dixie belle comin at me
With a rebel yell
And oohwee cold a ice thought I'd take a chance cause she looked ekinda nice don't ya know that looks can
Deceive she had a hold of me 

She was the finest damn thing that I'd ever seen
Standin right there in her cowgirl jeans
A genuine dixie belle comin at me with a rebel yell
& oohwee cold as ice
Thought I'd take a chance cause she looked kinda nice don't ya know that looks can deceive
When you give your heart to a thief
