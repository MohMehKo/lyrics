Dancing on the creek bank
Blue eyes and auburn hair
It was the best years of our lives
We didn’t have a care
Going 90 miles an hour
A truck and an old dirt road
Two young ass kids
Back where the dogwood flowers grow

Then graduation came
You was big city bound
I was going nowhere fast
So I just hung around
By the next time I seen you
Your love had grown cold
So I guess you broke my heart
Back where the dogwood flowers grow

White on the bloom
That April moon
It could have been forever darlin’ had we stayed together
But you had to go 
Time don’t slow
It took further from your home
Back where the dogwood flowers grow

So I took to drinking
I guess you wouldn’t recognize me
My souls torn and twisted
Like an old dogwood tree
We used to talk about forever
That was a million miles ago
So I’ll see it if I see
Back where the dogwood flowers grow

White on the bloom
That April moon
You ain’t dead set on leavin 
When you miss the one you need
Just getting real
Hell remember when
You had that hand to hold 
Back where the dogwood flowers grow
