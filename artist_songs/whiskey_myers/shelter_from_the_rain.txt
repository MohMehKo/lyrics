When I gave my heart to you
It was the only thing I had left to lose
Storm clouds broke and the sunshine came
You rode the storm and broke the chains
Yea, you broke those chains
Took me in out of the cold
I curse the man that says nothing gold can stay

You’re my shelter from the rain
Aw, the rain

When you gave your heart to me
There’s always a take out on your sleeve
Keep it steady and hold on, hey
This simple love will never change
Yea, it’ll never change
Yea, it’ll never get old
I curse the man that says nothing gold can stay

You’re my shelter from the rain
Aw, the rain
The rain

Yea, you broke those chains
Took me in out of the cold
You were there through my rough and rowdy days

You’re my shelter from the rain
Aw, from the rain
The rain
From the rain

When I gave my heart to you
It was the only thing I had left to lose
