Same old song on the radio tonight
One about wine and roses and candlelight
But I'm getting all from you with every town that i play
Maybe this distance is more than we can take

Some where in east texas your out alone
But I cant dry tears on the telephone
But I'm coming back to you I swear
I'll make it right I'm making my way back home on a red eye midnight flight

Ew baby here I'm comin' home
Cause I can't love you on the telephone
Ew darlin I Swear I'll make it right
No more lonely east Texas nights
No more lonely east Texas nights

2, 3, 4
Ew baby here I'm comin' home
Cause I can't love you on the telephone
Ew darlin I Swear I'll make it right
No more lonely east Texas nights
No more lonely east Texas nights

Ew baby here I'm comin' home
Cause I can't love you on the telephone
Ew darlin I Swear I'll make it right
No more lonely east Texas nights
No more lonely east Texas nights
