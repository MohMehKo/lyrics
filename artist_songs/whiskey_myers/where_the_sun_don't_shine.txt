Stretching that fence all day long
Post hole digger and a come along
Sweating out a living in the Texas heat
My money’s running thin and life ain’t cheap

This hard work ain’t cutting it lately
Repo man calling all the time
This honest wage ain’t savin us abby
So I’m setting up shop where the sun don’t shine

Where the sun don’t shine gonna take my time
Headed back to the holler gotta make a dime
With some corn, pressure and copper line
Gonna make a better living where the sun don’t shine

Where the sun don’t shine
Where the sun don’t shine

Single mom back against the wall
Child support ain’t paid at all
Shakin them bones from 7 to 3 
Doing what it takes to make ends meet
Miss minimum wage wasn’t cutting it lately 
Down and out had to draw the line
Waiting tables wasn’t raising a baby
Now she’s swinging on a pole where the sun don’t shine

Where the sun don’t shine gonna lose her mind
Dancing on the stage in the neon lights
With a swing, a shake, a shimmy to the side
Gonna make a better living where the sun don’t shine

Where the sun don’t shine
Where the sun don’t shine

Used to have a good job at the factory
Until he lost his legs to an IED
Worries al day about the lights staying on
His wife took off when the money was gone
And his real life ain’t cutting it lately 
Never was the fightin kind
And Uncle Sam ain’t saving your papers
So he’s cookin it up where the sun don’t shine

Where the sun don’t shine let the red smoke climb
Battery acid, bathtub kind
Shootin and scoopin them Sudafed lines
Turnin powder into cash where the sun don’t shine

Where the sun don’t shine
Where the sun don’t shine
