And I left Dallas for Birmingham
And I hit the ground, you changed your plans
I caught a train, oh, these ain't [?]
You jumped a plane and back to Arkansas

How far do I have to go to get to you, babe?

Swam in the river and I sailed the seas
Climbed up the mountain, all the tallest trees
I'll shoot the moon, swing from the stars
I'll take a rocket ship all the way to Mars

How far do I have to go to get to you, babe?
And how far do I have to go to get to you?

You don't mean to tease me, baby
To take me for a ride
It ain't your fault that you hooked my heart
And you left me on the line

You reeled me in from my bed
And it ain't right to do me like that
Body talks and I hear you say
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

(How far?)
No, I won't or that I should
(How far?)
The way I need you, oh, it ain't good

(How far?)
You got me weak, you took control
(How far?)
You twist my heart and confuse my soul

How far do I have to go to get to you, babe?
And how far do I have to go to get to you?

How far do I have to go?
How far do I have to go?
How far do I have to go to get to you, babe?
