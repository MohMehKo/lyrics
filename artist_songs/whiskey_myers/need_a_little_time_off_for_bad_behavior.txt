I need a little time off for bad behavior
Yea the devil in me done been asleep too long
I need a little time off for bad behavior
Yea it looks like I’ve been too good for too long

Well I’m up and gone at the break of dawn
I’ve been working like a regular dog
Keep my woman and the lights 
And the water and the phone turned on

I’ve been saying sir all day at work 
I’ve been saying yes ma’am at home
I’ve been storing up cuss words 
Keeping them under my tongue

I need a little time off for bad behavior
Yea the devil in me done been asleep too long
I need a little time off for bad behavior
Looks like I’ve been too good for too long

Well I’ve had this number on my mind awhile
I’ve been fighting out the urge to call
A pretty little strawberry blonde with a southern drawl
Some good ol boys from Alabama
Said the fish have been missing me
And I need to renew my friendship with Jim Beam

I need a little time off for bad behavior
Yea the devil in me done been asleep too long
I need a little time off for bad behavior
It looks like I’ve been too good for too long

Need a little time off for bad behavior
Yea the devil in me done been asleep too long
I need a little time off for bad behavior
Looks like I’ve been too good for too long

Yea it looks like I’ve been too good for too long
Yea it looks like I’ve been too good for too long
