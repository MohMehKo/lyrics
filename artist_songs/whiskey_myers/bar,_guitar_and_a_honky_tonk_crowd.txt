End post floatin' on a southbound breeze,
Somewhere between heaven and tall pine trees,
Heartland I'm missin' you,
Guitar playin' through the night, 
It felt pretty good yeah I'm feelin' alright,
As good as one for the price of two.

Its been along time gone,
Since the truths been told,
And I've seen my home,
Hey Curtis Loew,
Come on save my soul,
With a bar, guitar and a honky tonk crowd.

Buy me a ticket Lord put me on a train,
Don't matter how I go I'll even walk through the rain,
Southland I'm missin' you,
Well the sky is high and the moon is low,
I found some country tunes playin' on the radio,
And I know that I'm there, Lord I know I'm there. 

Its been a long time gone,
Since the truths been told,
And I've seen my home,
Hey Curtis Loew,
Come on save my soul,
With a bar, guitar and a honky tonk crowd.

Its been a long time gone,
Since the truths been told,
And I've seen my home, 
Hey Curtis Loew,
Come on save my soul,
With a bar, guitar and a honky tonk crowd
With a bar, guitar and a honky tonk crowd.
