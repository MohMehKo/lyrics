Clear skies, 
weatherman said how are we to know,
how are we to know.

Clouds lie with the man upstairs,
and the wind began to blow,
the wind began to blow.

Split second is all it takes,
and our time on earth is gone,
our time is gone.

Stormy night in a warm September,
a young mans soul moves on,
a young mans soul moves on.

Hopes and dreams fall to the ground,
for-granted life forsakes me know,
can't believe you're gone,
know how slowly time moves on.

My mind takes me back,
to when we were young,
when we were young.

Playin ball almost every fall,
those were the days,
always a smile on your face.

Smiles they come,
rain or shine,
never was a better man,
never a better man,

Caring heart and a buffled mind,
no one could understand,
no one could understand.

Hopes and dreams fall to the ground,
for-granted life forsakes me know,
can't believe you're gone,
know how slowly time moves on.

Been a year now,
since you passed,
where have the days gone,
where have they gone. 

Your time on earth, 
was spent to fast,
but your spirit won't live alone,
God has called you home.

Hopes and dreams fall to the ground,
for-granted life forsakes me know,
can't believe you're gone,
now I know you've just moved on.
