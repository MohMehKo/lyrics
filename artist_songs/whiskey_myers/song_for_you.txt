So many ways to say I miss you
But I couldn't count no matter how I try
They wouldn't fill the hole you left gaping
Only drive it deeper, farther down inside
I never blame you, never blame you for leaving
You didn't have a choice, nor did I
Struggling with the fact, the fact I'm no longer having
My rock to lean on, a shoulder to cry

Holidays couldn't get much longer
If only those memories could be more real
And I wish I could say, you left me stronger
Lying to myself wont change how I feel

Trying like hell to more forward
Empty bottles seem to lend a hand
Staying up 'till dawn, drinking whiskey
Can't drown my pain or make a better man

Holidays couldn't get much longer
If only those memories could be more real
And I wish I could say, you left me stronger
Lying to myself wont change how I feel

I took after you since I can remember
Look, walk, and talk nearly just the same
I don't think I'm ready for the burden 
Of carrying on our family name
I know for a fact how much you loved me
Never missed a chance to tell me so
I can only hope soon enough I'll realize
You raised me up to not fall but grow

Holidays couldn't get much longer
If only those memories could be more real
And I wish I could say, you left me stronger
Lying to myself wont change how I feel
