Summer is comin', to an end
Just like the good times you'll be gone once again
Out of my life and out of this, one-horse town
Just like a bird you fly so high above the ground

But you're gone away and you left me far behind
You're gone away, can't get you outta my mind
You're gone, away, and I am here to stay
Away

Fall is so cold without you here by my side
I'm still in the same damn town and hell yeah I'm probably high
The clouds are so lonely and the sky it is so blue
And until you return my love is still for you

But you're gone away and you left me far behind
You're gone away, can't get you outta my mind
You're gone, away, and I am here to stay
Away

But you're gone away, you left me far behind
You're gone away, I can't get you outta my mind
You're gone, away, and I am here to stay
Away, yeah
Yeah

Yeah
Yeah-oh
Whoa
