A couple of pretty flowers
Is what I brought I to you
I saw you through a broken window 
With a different point of view

You had signs of depression
From a long line of sin
And your face tells a story 
Bout the places you have been
I love you so,
I thought you should know

And that muddy waters flowin
As you take my hand
Past the creek down by the holler
Through your daddies land
I could buy you a diamond
But I cannot change your world
Cuz I ain't got no money
You'll never be my girl no no
I thought you should know

You was gonna be a singer
Or be a movie star
But you cant catch no breaks baby
And Hollywood is hard

Now you work down at the time out 
Off 155
And you're dancing for your dollar
Just tryin to stay alive 
It hurts me so
I thought you should know

You feed your addiction
With your crystal meth
And I plea for your life 
as it takes you to your death

You make your deal with the devil
As your looks begin to fade
I saw you laughin through the tears 
As you slowly slipped away
I watched you go
I thought you should know
Yeah I watched you go
I thought you should know

That cold rain is pourin 
As they lower you in a grave
I can barely recognize you
In your fragile state

No more signs of depression
From a long time ago
I throw in a pretty flower
As they slowly laid you low, it was a rose
I thought you should know
Yeah it was a rose 
I thought you should know

A couple of pretty flowers is what I brought to you
I saw you through a broken window
With a different point of view..
