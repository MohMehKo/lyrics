Hear the blast from a shotgun
Seemed to disappear into the night
Ain’t no two-bit lawman
Got a chance in hell of takin’ my life

Spend most of my nights down by a campfire
Light up the stars with my game
Left home at only fifteen
Started out to make my name

[Chorus]
And we were american outlaws
Ridin’ across the plain
From Montana down to Mexico
Tryin’ to find a better way

I see our names on railroad posters
Sayin’ we’re wanted all around this land
Got ambushed by 16 enemy soldiers
At the creek just north of Choctaw Canyon

Bullets spread out over the horizon
There was no fear in our eyes
Hear they sent 16 in to get us
Word is that only two survived.

[Chorus]

Headed down south to hangouts in Mexico
Gonna to let the smoke clear for a while
Taking that low down dirty tequila
Them senoritas sure make us smile

Some say we’re no longer livin
Half a million voices took our lives
If you hear the blast from a shotgun
Might see us reappear into the night

[Chorus]
