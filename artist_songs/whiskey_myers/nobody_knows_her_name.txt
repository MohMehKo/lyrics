She sits alone in a motel room
Watchin the sun lay low
In a western sky
It's a long way to nashville
It's all uphill
Maybe she'll make it this time
A travellin man in a beat-up van
Playin for hopes & dreams
Maybe some gasoline
& blood from her calloussed hands
Flows across the strings
But tonight she sings

& nobody knows her name
(nobody knows her name)
Feels her pain
(nobody feels her pain)
Won't ya sing her one more song
(sing her one more song)
Sing it loud
(won't ya sing along)
Won't ya sing along
Na da da da
La da da da da da
(la la la)
La da da
(la la la la)

She sits alone in a motel room
Watchin the stars shine bright
In a southern sky
She hasn"t seen her family in half a year
But her memories
Tell her they're still here
Well openin a show up outta town
She looks into the crowd
They're all singin loud
The feelin she gets when she's up on stage
Is worth the price she's paid
Cause tonight she plays

& nobody knows her name
(nobody knows her name)
Feels her pain
(nobody feels her pain)
Won't ya sing her one more song
(sing her one more song)
Sing it loud
(won't ya sing along)
Won't ya sing along
Na da da da
La da da da da da
(la la la)
La da da
(la la la la)

& nobody knows her name
(nobody knows her name)
Feels her pain
(nobody feels her pain)
Won't ya sing her one more song
(sing her one more song)
Sing it loud (won't ya sing along)
La da da da
