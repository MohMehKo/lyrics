There's a special place nobody knows
Way up on the hill
Where the moon shines through the tall pines
And the whole damn world stands still
I'm gonna take you there where you can't be found
Put a blanket down and melt away

There ain't nothing on this mountain but us, lightning bugs and rain

Girl I think I love you
Barefoot and soaking wet
You're the prettiest thing this mountain's ever seen
A picture I can't forget
With your sparkling eyes and these fireflies
A river in a frame

There ain't nothing on this mountain but us, lightning bugs and rain

Never saw the view from here get any better
But you're dancing 'round the fire
Like you control the weather
And here in the clouds
There's a storm on the way

There ain't nothing on this mountain but us, lightning bugs and rain

There's a special place nobody knows
Way up on the hill
That's where we'll make our babies
In that Cadillac De Ville
And we'll sit out on the porch
Just growing old
Giving all the stars new names

There ain't nothing on this mountain but us, lightning bugs and rain
Lightning bugs and rain
