Old man is walking down memory lane
His piercing stare tears out through the rain
You can see in his eyes
Ain’t too much life left in them veins
He tells his son “I’ll be out on the run if I ever get out of this chair”
And if you don’t mind, I’ll be out of my mind
Thanks for the time you could spare

Cause I know you’re leavin
Don’t leave me believing I might
Your smile is misleadin
Your eyes are deceiving my fight
Cause I can’t hold on
And I can’t move on

Young man is walkin down Faith Avenue
Can’t understand what he’s fixin to lose
You can see through his tears a moment of fear come creepin through
He tells his father he wouldn’t even bother
If I could ever get over you
And if you don’t mind, I’ll make up for lost time
I swear on my life this is true

Cause I know you’re leavin
Don’t leave me believing I might
Your smile is misleadin
Your eyes are deceiving my fight
Cause I can’t hold on
And I can’t move on

Cause I know you’re leavin
Don’t leave me believing I might
Your smile is misleadin
Your eyes are deceiving my fight
Cause I can’t hold on
And I can’t move on
