'05 came around & our friends they all went off to college
Said they were gonna do somethin with their lives
Well me & kyle hope stayed dumbasses in our home town
Out fillin ourselves up on keystone light
Well I hope they're havin a good time down there in college station
Down at the chicken playin dominoes

Well me & kyle hope still back here in palestine, texas!
Out gettin drunk out on some ol backroads...

& we had the stereo up & the beer iced down
We were tossin em back & burnin em down
& that's the way it goes
When your friends all leave & it's only you & me
We were headed back down to brushy creek
Til the mornin rolled around
Back in our hometown
Back in our hometown

A good cold beer & bow season
Ya know it sure made us smile
Even tried to go to tvcc for a while
Althought I tried, everytime I got myself near
Kyle hope would meet me in the parkin lot
With a case of cold beer

& we had the stereo up & the beer iced down
We were tossin em back & burnin em down
& that's the way it goes
When your friends all leave & it's only you & me
We were headed back down to brushy creek
Til the mornin rolled around
Back in our hometown
Back in our hometown

& we had the stereo up & the beer iced down
We were tossin em back & burnin em down
& that's the way it goes
When your friends all leave & it's only you & me
We were headed back down to brushy creek
Til the mornin rolled around
Back in our hometown
Back in our hometown

Palestine, texas!!
