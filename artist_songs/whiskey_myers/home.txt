Take me home to where I know
That place I’ve come to love so
Sugar sand and red clay hills
Tall pine trees and whippoorwills

I know there’s a place
When this damn city is more than I can take
I’ve got to get away
When I’m low I know I can take it back home

I live on a lost highway
Mass confusion and misery
Set me free that’s where I’ll be
Between the Neches and the Trinity

I know there’s a place 
When this old world is more than I can take
I’ve got to get away
When I’m low I know I can take it back home

There’s a girl who stole my heart
From where I am we are miles apart 
Well she’s all mine
She tastes like wine
Wild as a honey suckle vine

I know there’s a place 
Where she gives me more than I can take
I’ve got to get away
When I’m low I know I can take it back home

Back home
