Broke down in Stone Mountain Georgia
Many miles from my home
A trail of tears that I've left searchin
Some of yours and my own
So I'm out here prayin to Jesus
For a ghost in the night
Cause all they want is a simple dollar
A song I won't write

Mama, Let it be
Ain't no man gonna take it from me
Hard times, I carry on
They've only seen the calm before the storm

Her faith and a bottle of bourbon
I seen truth on the road
There ain't a man in this world that ain't hurtin 
All carrying a load
So roll on I'll see you sweet mama
When their day is done
With some strength and love from family 
Your oldest son

Mama, let it be
Ain't no man gonna take it from me
Hard times, I carry on
They've only seen the calm before the storm

Let it storm
I've got a few things on my mind
They wanna take it and break it
And make it their own
And it's time I keep mine 

Mama, let it be
There ain't no man gonna take it from me
Hard times, I carry on
They've only seen the calm before the storm
Calm before the storm
