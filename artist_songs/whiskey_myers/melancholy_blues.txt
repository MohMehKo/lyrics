Old guitar is what I choose
Empty pack of smokes says man sing the blues
Got your foot out the door and you head to the hole
Close your eyes you see me no more

Ah see me no more
Ah see me no more

Down on the corner for a ride 
I drop to my knees when you pass by 
The street is wet and so are my clothes
Thought you were mine but no one knows

Ah now no one knows
Ah now no one knows
Ah now no one knows
Ah now no one knows

Thinking of you keeps me up all night 
So I went with some friends but it wasn't right
I wish you were here, so do I
They ask me about you so I tell them a lie

Oh I tell em lies
Oh I tell em lies 
Oh I tell em lies
Oh I tell em lies

So pour me a drink or two or three 
And toss them back till I stop begging please 
You know my stomach hurts and my brain is dead
Now sleep wont come but I lay in bed

Oh I lay in bed
Oh I lay in bed 
Oh I lay in bed 
Oh I lay in bed
