Earthquakes and Hurricanes
And slow movin’ freight trains
Girl that’s how,
You make me feel sometimes

But you were gone away from here
So far my dear
Up by that northern state line

[Chorus]
Virginia
Lie in all my broken dreams
You pick me up
And you sure make me smile
Virginia
And I would give anything
To come dance around
My memory for awhile

[Solo]

Off in the moonlight,
Sweet southern moonlight
A billion stars,
Bare feet in the sand

I’m countin’ down the summer days
Smiling at our reckless ways
You was my girl
And I was your man

[Chorus]

[Solo]

That’s the way the story goes
Of broken hearts and sad souls
You left me here,
Not saying goodbye

Said you headed with your paw
North Arkansas
But that was back before, 1975

[Chorus]
