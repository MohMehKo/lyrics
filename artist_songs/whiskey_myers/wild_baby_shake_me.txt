Can’t nothing ever break me
From this ball and chain
Not even a gail force wind from cat 5 hurricane
She’s hot as a delta summer, sweet as a Georgia peach
Yea she’s fire on all 8 cylinders keeps that motor clean

Wild, wild, wild
Wild baby shake me

Love that drips like honey
I’m buzzin like a bee
And them bedposts get to rockin
When she shakes it down on me
Barefoot in the kitchen
Catfish in the pan
She’s dancing around the fire in nothing but her camo pants

Wild, wild, wild
Wild baby shake me

Wild baby shake me

Wild baby shake me

(you gots to hold on)
(you gots to hold on)
(you gots to hold on)
(...onto me)

Oh that love it just takes me away
Don’t worry ‘bout a damn thang
I’m here to stay
Yeah ya got that love
Oooo it’s all that I need
Don’t worry ‘bout a damn thang, mama
Just hold on tight to me

(you gots to hold on)
(you gots to hold on)
(you gots to hold on)
(...onto me) [repeat 5 times]

Yeah you got to hold on

Ohhhh hold on
Hold on, hold on
Yeah you got to hold on
Hold on

You gots to hold on
You gots to hold on
On to me
(you gots to hold on)
(you gots to hold on)
(you gots to hold on)
(...on to me)
