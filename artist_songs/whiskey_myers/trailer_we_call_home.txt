Two young kids and diamond ring
Little white church south of Palestine
Baby bump and pretty bouquet
Yeah, I went to work the very next day
Punching that clock working that line
Double shifts and over time
My hands are numb and body's sore
Getting by and wanting more

So many dreams that I ain't showing
So many lives that I can't live
Oh, the years just keep on rolling
And I wish I had so much more to give

Yeah, times get tough but love is strong
Here in this trailer that we call home

She got one on her hip and one on the way
Grocery list and bills to pay
Momma by day and school at night
I tried so hard to get it right
I got dreams. What can I say?
Sometimes life gets in the way
Well, getting by and wanting more
Baby, there ain't no shame in being poor

Yeah, times get tough but love is strong
Here in this trailer that we call home
Yeah, times get tough but we carry on
Here in this trailer that we call home
Here in this trailer that we call home
Here in this trailer that we call home
