Losing myself further and further it seems
Hell I’m burnin a hole
I’m killin all my dreams
You came along helped me find my way
Oh but I’m so far gone now
Don’t know if I’ll ever be saved

Cause there’s lightning in the bottle
I’m bound to ride away
That lightning brings my hard times
That lightning brings my pain
But I cannot fix it no matter how hard I try
I’m stuck here in misery 
The wreckage of my life

Yea I’ve hit the bottle but not like this before
Half drunk running around every town
Every pretty little whore
More and more I love you
More and more I hate you just the same
Oh and I fill you up just to know my pain

Cause there’s lightning in the bottle
I’m bound to ride away
That lightning brings my hard times
That lightning brings my pain
But I cannot fix it no matter how hard I try
I’m stuck here in misery 
The wreckage of my life

Yea, there’s lightning in the bottle
I’m bound to ride away
That lightning brings my hard times
That lightning brings my pain
But I cannot fix it no matter how hard I try
I’m stuck here in misery 
The wreckage of my life

The wreckage of my life

Losing myself further and further it seems
Hell I’m burnin a hole
I’m killing all my dreams
