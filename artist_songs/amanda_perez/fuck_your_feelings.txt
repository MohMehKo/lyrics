I think this shit funny
A pocket full of money
But you fuck with a broke bitch who lives up in the projects
Tell her how you got it
And tell her how I copped it
And if it weren't for me you wouldn't have shit up in that closet
You wont really wanna fuck wit me
Cause I go below the belt
Ima put some shit up in yo life that you ain't never felt
And I don't like to hold no grudges
But I'm thinking to myself, myself

Fuck your feelings
Cause you didn't give a damn about mine
Fuck your feelings
I don't wanna hear none of that crying
Said you hurting now and you want me back
But I can't fix the pieces to this broken glass
You know what you done to me
Ain't no feelings your my enemy

You had it all
Put my heart into your hands
Forgave you once
And then yo ass did it again
Tried to take my kindness for weakness
Now you the only one up on that weak shit
And you know
You know that you did me wrong
So tell that bitch that she can have yo ass
Cause I ain't never coming back

Fuck your feelings
Cause you didn't give a damn about mine
Fuck your feelings
I don't wanna hear none of that crying
Said you hurting now and you want me back
But I can't fix the pieces to this broken glass
You know what you done to me
Ain't no feelings your my enemy

I put a roof over your head
Food up in yo mouth
Took that bitch to the crib
You cheated in our house
Ain't no talking bout it
I will never work it out
So you can save them words
That are coming out ya mouth
Cause you know

You know what you've done to me
Ain't no need to sneak around
Bitch you finally free
I'm done with this emotional rollercoaster
I think by now you know this shit is over

Fuck your feelings
Cause you didn't give a damn about mine
Fuck your feelings
I don't wanna hear none of that crying
Said you hurting now and you want me back
But I can't fix the pieces to this broken glass
You know what you done to me
Ain't no feelings your my enemy
