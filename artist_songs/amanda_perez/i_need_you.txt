Every night that I'm with you,
I can see each day, that our love is true.
From all the long fights in the middle of the night.
To all the hard work to try to make it tight.
You're the one I want for the rest of my life. 

[Chorus:]
I need you by my side babe,
I need you in my life babe,
I need you here babe.
You're so sincere babe.
I can never give you less babe,
good lovin' babe, from the best babe
I love you boy, you're all i need.
Want to give you all of me.
You fill my heart with all your soul,
I don't need to look
for love no more.
You fill my dreams,
you always make good love to me, to me.

[Chorus]

Up down move your body around,
don't stop cause i'm feeling you now.
Push pull I love what you do.
Believe in you but i'm
no fool, you give me nothing, but love and respect.
Especially when we're soaking wet, baby

[Chorus 2x]
