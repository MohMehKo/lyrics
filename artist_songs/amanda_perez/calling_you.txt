I keep calling you.
Tell me, was it something I said?
Calling you.

Woke up this morning and you told me,
you're tired of the way we're livin',
and it's time for you to leave.
How could you do this to me?
Whatever I had I gave you my last,
now you tell me that you wanna leave,
and all your stuff is packed.
How you gonna do me like that?

[Chorus 2x]
I keep calling you,
but you ain't picking up your phone.
Can you tell me whats going on?
Was it something I said?
Was it something I did?
'Cause I need to know if there's an us anymore.

Sitting here and I'm losing my mind,
'cause I gave you all of my love,
I gave you all of my time,
gave you all my time.
Now you wanna turn and walk away,
you tell me you dont want to stay.
I thought you were my man and I was your lady.

[Chorus 2x]
I keep calling you,
but you ain't picking up your phone.
Can you tell me whats going on?
Was it something I said?
Was it something I did?
'Cause I need to know if there's an us anymore.

Why couldn't you tell me the truth,
if you didn't want me to kick it with you.
Now I'm sitting here all alone,
'cause you couldn't be a man
and pick up your phone.

[Chorus 4x]
I keep calling you,
but you ain't picking up your phone.
Can you tell me whats going on?
Was it something I said?
Was it something I did?
'Cause I need to know if there's an us anymore.
