Oh Oh
In my life, my life
Everytime I see you I lose my cool
Goin out of my mind cuz i can't stop thinkin' bout you
looking at your sexy body
everynight i go to sleep want you to be the one right beside me

[Chorus:]
Boy I need you in my life
I need you
i'll be the one thats down to do or die
wipe away the tears when you feel the need to cry
loving you without no lies
cuz i need you in my life

everytime that i'm with you
all i wannna do is touch you
and if you let me i'll promise
i'll always love you
cuz i need to you in my life

[Chorus]

Boy i need you in my life
boy i need you
Need you in my life

[RAP:]
I need you in my life
you can be my man i can be your wife
show you things that you never seen before
turn off the lights close the door
kiss you all on your neck
where nobody oughta check
never let em disrespect
boy you ain't seen nothin' yet
be the one that'll be by your side
loving you till the day that i die
giving you good loving that'll make you cry
i can be bonnie you can be clyde
jump in your ride hit your switches side to side
cuz i need a man like you in my life
now you tell me what it be like
tell me, tell me what it be like
lets ride
cuz i need you in my life

need you in my life

boy i need you in my life
boy i need you [repeat till close]
