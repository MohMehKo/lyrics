Caught my eyes
From a distance
Don't be shy
Beginners listen
Can read your lips
So there's no reason for that whisperin
Your body telling me it's fiendin for a fixin
So who you with
Where is she
I'm used to pay the bills
If she should ever ask me
I'm only here for the weekend
So all I wanna know is can I

Can I be the one who's gonna lay you down
I'm not gonna stop until you make that sound
Freak for the weekend (gonna be your)
Freak for the weekend (lemme be your)
Freak for the weekend (gonna be your)
Gonna be your freak for the weekend
Oh
Can I be the one who's gonna lay you down
I'm not gonna stop until you make that sound
Freak for the weekend (gonna be your)
Freak for the weekend (lemme be your)
Freak for the weekend (gonna be your)
Gonna be your freak for the weekend
Oh

Imma lay you down
Wanna lick you out
Taste so good
I just wanna eat you out
I'll fulfill all your fantasies
I ain't met nobody that can really handle me
Bet your girl
Bet your bitch
Wish that she was bad as me
Call me [?]
Cuz I'm something like a battery
I keep going and going
And I can't be stopped
When I'm in the bedroom you say you like it when I'm on top

Can I be the one who's gonna lay you down
I'm not gonna stop until you make that sound
Freak for the weekend (gonna be your)
Freak for the weekend (lemme be your)
Freak for the weekend (gonna be your)
Gonna be your freak for the weekend
Oh
Can I be the one who's gonna lay you down
I'm not gonna stop until you make that's sound
Freak for the weekend (gonna be your)
Freak for the weekend (lemme be your)
Freak for the weekend (gonna be your)
Gonna be your freak for the weekend

I [?] the deuces up
Cuz I am loving single
If we are not on the same page
We are not equal
You gotta get up on my level
Cuz if I'm thinking about you
Than you better be a headful
Sitting at the bar
And you giving me those eyes
And your girl looking [?]
Ripping off to your type
But if you come over the night
Imma give you what you like
You be ripping on my sheets
And on my pillow you gonna bite

Can I be the one who's gonna lay you down
I'm not gonna stop until you make that sound
Freak for the weekend
Freak for the weekend (lemme be your)
Freak for the weekend
Gonna be your freak for the weekend
Can I be the one who's gonna lay you down (I wanna lay you down)
I'm not gonna stop until you make that sound (baby baby be the one)
Freak for the weekend
Freak for the weekend
(gonna be your)
Freak for the weekend
(lemme be your)
Freak for the weekend
