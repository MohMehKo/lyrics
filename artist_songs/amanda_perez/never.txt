You walked into my life, when i was down and out
Took away my pain and gave me your smile
And at the time, still lovin someone else
But not knowing why 'cause they were the reason why I felt the way I felt
And then one day I realized you were the one for me
I was so blind, but baby now I see

And I'll never let you go, no, no, no
I love you so
And I'll get on both my knees and I'll beg you please
Will you spend the rest of your life with me
Cause I'll never babe
Want to let you go, oh
And I'll never play, no, no, no ,no, no, no, no

I wish that I could turn back the hands of time
Cause if I wouldv'e knew your love was like this
Back then I wouldv'e made you mine, oh yeah
If I had to die a thousand times a day
I would do it for you, just to take
The pain that I have given you away
Cause I love you and I never want to

And I'll never let you go, no, no, no
I love you so
And I'll get on both my knees and I'll beg you please
Will you spend the rest of your life with me
Cause I'll never babe
Want to let you go, oh
And I'll never play, no, no, no ,no, no, no, no

[Bridge:]
I'm sorry (oh yes I am)
I'm sorry (I'm so sorry baby)

And I'll never let you go, no, no, no
I love you so
And I'll get on both my knees and I'll beg you please
Will you spend the rest of your life with me
Cause I'll never babe
Want to let you go, oh
And I'll never play, no, no, no ,no, no, no, no
