Lately I know me and you been going through some hard times
But I will climb the highest mountain,
swim the deepest sea just to keep you mine
And you don't really know what I feel when I feel your touch
It makes me wanna get on both my knees and tell you take all my love
Baby take all my love

Baby please don't leave
I know I said a lot of things
But I'm so, I'm so sorry (I'm so sorry)
I'm begging you, begging you not to go
I couldn't stand to wake up each morning
and not see your face anymore
Baby please

A feeling real deep down inside it makes me wanna cry
I ask myself why did I
Do those things that I didn't mean
It's not too late baby we still can see if it was meant to be
me and you and you and me, baby please

Baby please don't leave
I know I said a lot of things
But I'm so, I'm so sorry (I'm so sorry)
I'm begging you, begging you not to go
I couldn't stand to wake up each morning
and not see your face anymore
Baby please

Everybody makes mistakes
But baby please don't let this wait
I can spend my life without you
I wouldn't know what to do
Life's like a rollercoaster up and down
when you go through this
I wanna be around (be around)
I wanna feel you next to me
Oh baby, please don't leave

Baby please don't leave
I know I said a lot of things
But I'm so, I'm so sorry (I'm so sorry)
I'm begging you, begging you not to go
I couldn't stand to wake up each morning
and not see your face anymore
Baby please
