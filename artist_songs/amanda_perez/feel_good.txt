Let me bite your lip
All over your chest is where I wanna kiss
Don't be afraid, let it all go
Turn off the lights and take off your clothes

Close the door and just relax I've got a plan and that's a fact
I'll fulfill all your fantasies

Where you find yourself with me in the bed
Pull my hair touch on my back
