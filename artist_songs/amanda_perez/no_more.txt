wipe away my tears cuz there aint

see all you wanna do 
is play game with my mind
but boy i don't play games
for the simple fact that 
I don't have the time
I kept it real with you
but you didn't keep it real with me
so here's the keys to your car
I think it's time for you to leave

[Chorus]

but you aint ever home
tell me hit you on your cellular
but your cellular aint ever on

who would be by your side
but i got sick and tired 
of all your lies

[Chorus]
