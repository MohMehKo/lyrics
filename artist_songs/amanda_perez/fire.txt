Yeah, you so fire.
You so fire.

Come on in and take off your coat.
It's rainin' outside and all your clothes are soaked,
all your clothes are soaked.
Would like me to get you a drink?
Would you like me to put your shirt and your pants
in my washin' machine, in my washin' machine?
Don't worry I got a top that you can have.
Make yourself at home boy, just relax.
Give me 5 minutes and I'll be back,
so I can hit that, hit that, hit that.

[Chorus 2x]
I'd be a liar, if i said that you wasn't fire.
You know I keeps it real,
showin' you what's the deal,
'cause you the only one that I feel.

Five minutes is up, so I head back.
I can't see a damn thing, 'cause it's pitch black.
So I turn to my left, 'cause I hear a noise.
Comin' close to my ear, I hear a voice.
A voice that says, if I move he gon' make it hurt,
so I lift my arms, while he takes my shirt.
You do it hard, but you never make it hurt.
It's like havin' a seizure, while you put in work.

[Chorus 2x]
I'd be a liar, if i said that you wasn't fire.
You know I keeps it real,
showin' you what's the deal,
'cause you the only one that I feel.

You in all my thoughts 
and all my dreams.
You the only man in my life,
that's made me cream, that's made me cream.
When you hit my spot,
you make me shake.
From my fingertips, all the way to my legs.
It's funny, 'cause I can't even move.
I can't understand how you do the things you do.

You so fire.
You so fire.

[Chorus 2x]
I'd be a liar, if i said that you wasn't fire.
You know I keeps it real,
showin' you what's the deal,
'cause you the only one that I feel.
