[verse 1:]
This be the day that i never forget driving in my bentley
sipping on my way bangs in the trunk and i heard my
my chest blinged all out and its all on my neck
I went to the crib about 2:00 forgot my keys so i had to knock
noone came to the front so i went to the back checked out the shit
that just happened i caught my man in the pool with a girl nice
skinny chick with Sherley Temple curls she got it in easy she tried to
cap **** and i told the little girl to keep ur hand on these

[chorus:]

and if you get a * the gone fill your throat
i could care less if you joked

[verse 2:]
See you tryin to be a playboy
but got caught up in the game now you noy
matter fact you could go upstairs and you could pack
try to love you but you dont know how to act try
to hit me from the front and not from the back
picking up chicks in my bens in my trunk
this the cadillac this aint the way that it goes
cause i sure aint your trick and i aint you hoe
so things dont last forever so you gots to go
jump in your ride put the medal to the floor
dont leave nothing behind take all your clothes
take the bloody towel you used for your bloody nose
this right here the case is close if you didnt know then boy now you
know you up for a biz so now your sold uh uh uh uh uh

[repeat chorus:]

[verse 3:]
better not make an excuse to come to the crib
dont try to beg for a home cause you aint got no where to live
sorry little daddy thats the way that it is and right now i gotta handle my biz
cause you the type of man that i gotta shut down cause you the type of man that
i dont
need around i caught you creeping
for all this time it was you that was peeping on all your late night calls
breaking my laws sliding off panties and unsnapping braws
dont blame it on me you did it just because dont try to say you didnt like the
way that
i was you so fake pleeding with me that it was a mistake boy you was in a dream
but
now your awake tell your girl friend to come pick up her snakes so
i can go to sun set boulevard and get me a drink, find a true man faster than
you can
blink what made you think that your shit didnt stink you think that you silk but I'm smoother than mink
