Ooh I dedicate,
ooh I dedicate.

Lately I been thinking 'bout 
all the things we been going through,
and how you break my heart.
You think that I don't love you, 
but if you look deep inside your heart,
you know that I really do care,
so when you need me,
I'll promise I will be right there.

[Chorus]
I dedicate this song to the love of my life,
'cause lately I know things haven't seem to be going right,
but you know I'm the one for you and you're the one for me,
that's why I sing this song,
to tell you that I love you, 
'cause you're my one and only.

Lying in my bed,
tears falling down my face,
praying to god,
that our love dont fade away,
'cause it's ok, 'cause we can work it out,
'cause with you I can't live without.
These words I need to say,
'cause to you I dedicate.

[Chorus]
I dedicate this song to the love of my life,
'cause lately I know things haven't seem to be going right,
but you know I'm the one for you and you're the one for me,
that's why I sing this song,
to tell you that I love you, 
'cause you're my one and only.

Oh you're the one that I adore,
and no matter what we go through,
I'll love you forever and more.
So, you say that you never miss a good friend til they're gone.
Well if you love me like you say you do, 
you'll show me the way back to your heart, and that's right.

[Chorus 2x]
I dedicate this song to the love of my life,
'cause lately I know things haven't seem to be going right,
but you know I'm the one for you and you're the one for me,
that's why I sing this song,
to tell you that I love you, 
'cause you're my one and only.

I dedicate.
