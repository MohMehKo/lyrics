Tell me have you ever loved someone so much that it makes you want to cry
Tell me have you ever loved someone that no matter what they did you needed them by your side
O I'm losing my mind, steady thinking about you all the time
O I'm telling you this is it, I can't live with out your kiss

Baby I know that I can't live without you in my life
But baby why can't I just do all the things that's right
O baby I know that I can't live without you in my life
But I can see it when I look at you
I can see it now that I don't deserve you

So many nights I sat and fooled with you
Not even realizing that I might lose you
Never admitting that I make mistakes.
Not having no more of them tears falling down your face
But sometimes love is hard to recognize, even when you see it with your own two eyes
Why do I feel this way in my life?
Why can't I just run and hide from all the blame that I've given you.
Tell me why because I don't deserve you

Baby I know that I can't live without you in my life
But baby why can't I just do all the things that's right
O baby I know that I can't live without you in my life
But I can see it when I look at you, I can see it now that I don't deserve you

I don't deserve to feel your touch...
O I don't deserve to feel your love
I don't deserve to feel your lips, to have your kiss
But baby I don't deserve you, I don't deserve you
O baby I know that I can't live without you in my life
But baby why can't I just do all the things that's right
O baby I know that I can't live without you in my life
But I can see it when I look at you, I can see it now
That I don't deserve you

Tell me have you ever loved someone so much that makes you want to cry
Tell me have you ever loved someone that no matter what they did you needed them by your side
