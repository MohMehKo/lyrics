Oooooooooooooo

Tried to hide my tears
Hoping they can't see
What I feel inside
all the real shit about me.
I'm that flower that can't even grow
What I feel inside I hope they never know oh. All by myself no where to go oh
I'm like that child locked in a cold dark room. See the sun has gone away 
now I can't wait for the day to see that rain fall and wash my stress away.

[Chorus 2x]
Rain come fall down on me
take away fall the things that I can see
rain come fall down on me 
wash away all my pain and misery

Can't seem to run can't seem to hide
I hate that money
The only way I can change my life
How could I let it get this far
why things are the way they are now
the only thing I'm left with is a broken heart
How could I ever said the things that I've say
How could I ever pushed my family away
Now I'm begging for the cha-ange
Oh I'm praying for that rain. 

[Chorus 2x]
Rain come fall down on me
take away fall the things that I can see
rain come fall down on me 
wash away all my pain and misery

Rain (rain,rain)
On me (on meeeee)
Rain on me (rain on me, rain on meeeeee)
Rain (rain,rain)
Oooooooonnnnn meeeeeeeeeeeee
Rain on me (Rain on me, Rain on me, Rain on me)
Rain on me (Rain on me, Rain on me, Rain on me)

[Chorus 2x]
Rain come fall down on me
take away fall the things that I can see
rain come fall down on me 
wash away all my pain and misery-yy
