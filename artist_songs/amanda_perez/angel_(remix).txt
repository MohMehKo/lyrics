It's been five months since (Ohhhh) you went away
Left without a word and nothin' to say
God send me an angel

God send me an angel from the heaven’s above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
Cause all I do is cry 
God send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes

Amanda: See it’s been five months since you went away
Left without a word and nothing to say
Want to wil’ out want to up and leave
See it’s all about you it’s not about me
Break me down from in and out 
See I knew from the jump you had some doubts
Should have known then you would never stay true
Should have known then that I could never change you
Now I’m on my knees and I’m begging god please
Take away this pain that I’m feeling cause it’s just too much for me
And I try to open up my eyes I sure do try to see
But this man got my heart in a box and I can’t even find the key god please

God send me an angel from the heaven’s above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
Cause all I do is cry 
God send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes

Preemo: Come on that’s right come on 
No matter what I do it stays the same
Told me I got to leave cause I wouldn’t change
Still I couldn’t see I was stuck in the game
Told me to leave my key or the locks gonna change
You want a new day one without me
But I’m stuck with this pain while she’s yelling get out Pre
What happens when your ride or die chick is living every night with some good bye ish
Inside I’m dying 
Just want to kiss your eye lids
Help the pretty green eyes stop crying
One more chance take a trip to Hawaii
She just looked at me and started sighing
I guess this is good bye still not realizing what it all means
Still got the dreams that included you and me
Got me on one knee willing to do anything to make it right
I’m trying to get doctor Phil’s number for advice

Amanda: I never thought twice when I rolled the dice
Never thought so many times you’d make me cry
Deep down in my heart I used to believe that I was meant for you and you was meant for me
But without trust there is no love
And I’m sure gonna miss them kisses and hugs
Got to let go or I never will 
Can’t wait for the nights where I can’t stay still
Love ain’t for free got to pay the bills 
Say that you won’t but I know that you will
Deep in my heart I know you’ll never change
And everything that you do I’ll always be the blame

God send me an angel from the heaven’s above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
Cause all I do is cry 
God send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes 

God send me an angel from the heaven’s above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
Cause all I do is cry 
God send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes

Oh god...send me an angel 
Send me (Oh baby) an angel 
Send me an angel from the heavens above 
Send me an angel to heal my heart from being in love 
Oh god...(Amanda Perez...Preemo) send me an angel
