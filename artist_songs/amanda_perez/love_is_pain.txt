Why is love so much pain ?
Sitting on the roof starring at the stars 
Thinking to myself how could i have fell for someone so hard
When all i was told was lies
Now that i think about it ,it makes me cry

[chorus]
To know someone i gave my heart to 
Just tore my heart apart
A love that is endless
Why did this love have to start
Feeling the love i have for you 
Just rushes through my veins
Why does love have to be so much pain

Memories no one can take away
The pain that i feel each and everyday
And it is going to be hard ,but i will pull myself through
Or else I'll never get over loving you

To know someone i gave my heart to 
Just tore my heart apart
A love that is endless
Why did this love have to start
Feeling the love i have for you 
Just rushes through my veins
Why does love have to be so much pain

So much pain . ..
So many nights so many tears i've cried (cried)
No one to be by my side
Stuck with misery and pain you are the one to blame
Cause it hurts to know ...

To know someone i gave my heart to 
Just tore my heart apart
A love that is endless
Why did this love have to start
Feeling the love i have for you 
Just rushes through my veins
Why does love have to be so much pain

(Why does love have to be so much pain)
So much pain (so much pain)
Oh so much pain
