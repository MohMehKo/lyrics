[Verse 1:]
You don't know what you've done to me
Are you that blind to where you can't see?
I done climbed the highest mountains
I done swam the deepest sea
Only in return for you to take the air that I breathe?
I was your girl
I gave you my world
Now I'm surrounded by clouds
I can feel the hurting now

[Chorus:]
Oh Momma (Ooooh Ooh)
Tears running out my eyes
So sick of the light
Oh Momma (Ooooh Ooh)
Learn to love what I can hate
My heart is broke and it's too late

[Verse 2:]
Like pedals falling from a rose
Without the sun how will it grow?
I can feel, I can feel my heart don't wanna beat
I'm like that angel that's lost its wings
I've tried and I've tried
Asking God why
Does this have to be my life?

[Chorus:]
Oh Momma (Ooooh Ooh)
Tears running out my eyes
So sick of the light
Oh Momma (Ooooh Ooh)
Learn to love what I can hate
My heart is broke and it's too late

Momma (Oh momma)
Tears running out my eyes
So sick of the light (ohhhhhhh)
Oh Momma (Ooooh Ooh)
Learn to love what I can hate,
I'm running back and it's too late
Oh momma (Momma)
Take me away (Take me away)
Can't sleep (I can't sleep)
I can't shake the pain
I'm so alone (So Alone)
Wish I would've known (would've known)
That he was so cold
