It's Friday night we was geared from head to toe,
we was lookin' so tight.
The moment I leave your side
she tries to creep up from behind,
I seen her with my own eyes.
Why you tryna lie?
Theres plenty of other guys,
why you gotta fuck with mine?
See hoes like you get fucked up.
After the club it's on and that's what's up.

[Chorus]
Go ahead and look, yeah I know he's fine.
Try to run up, but he's already mine.
When he looks at you, he laughs in your face.
Silly hoes, you should know you can never take my place.
Go ahead and flaunt, and drop it like it's hot.
No matter what you do, he'll forget me not.
Don't try to be sneaky and keep it on the low.
You should already know, to him you're just another hoe.

She said what you mean,
I came to the bar to get me a drink.
Shit you was on my man faster than I can blink.
Watch you think I'm a fool?
Do you think he's gonna leave me to be with you?
You an average chick,
stop ridin' him like he was your shit,
'fore i cock back my hand and bust your lip.
It'll be a one way trip.
It's your last and this is it.

[Chorus]
Go ahead and look, yeah I know he's fine.
Try to run up, but he's already mine.
When he looks at you, he laughs in your face.
Silly hoes, you should know you can never take my place.
Go ahead and flaunt, and drop it like it's hot.
No matter what you do, he'll forget me not.
Don't try to be sneaky and keep it on the low.
You should already know, to him you're just another hoe.

All my ladies out there,
you know what I'm talkin' about.
If you gotta good man, you better look out,
'cause what you got is what they want.
Tell them hoes they better push on.
They on a mission.
Better listen to what I say,
'cause these hoes get around every day.

[Chorus 2x]
Go ahead and look, yeah I know he's fine.
Try to run up, but he's already mine.
When he looks at you, he laughs in your face.
Silly hoes, you should know you can never take my place.
Go ahead and flaunt, and drop it like it's hot.
No matter what you do, he'll forget me not.
Don't try to be sneaky and keep it on the low.
You should already know, to him you're just another hoe.
