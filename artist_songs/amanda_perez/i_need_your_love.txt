I need your love baby.
You been giving me so much lately.
Oh, I love the way you make me feel.
For you boy, I fell head over heels.

You make me wanna say,
[2x] ooohh baby baby.

Oh the way you make me feel inside,
your love I'll never deny.
The way you hold me tight,
the way you feel so right,
your love oh I like.
Baby, I'm yours.
You can give me your lovin' every day,
and I'll still need more.

Oh you make me wanna say,
[4x] oooohhh baby baby.

I'm just about at the end of my road,
but I can't stop trying,
I can't give up hope,
'cause I feel one day I'll hold you dear,
whisper I still love you,
until that day is here.

[4x] oooohhh baby baby
