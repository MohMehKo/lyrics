Yeah, oh you make me feel.
You make me feel good inside.
You look into my eyes.
I always try to hide my tears,
but you always see my cries,
always see my cries.
Just one kiss on my lips
and this love I know this is definitely it.
This is definitely it.

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I need
to be lovin' you holdin' you feelin' you next to me.
You make me feel so secure,
your love is so pure,
it makes me feel like I need more.
You make me feel so safe,
I couldnt ever let no one come and take your place.
You make me feel, you make feel.

Sunshine, you're finally shining over me.
Unconditional love I finally see.
See a world with a whole new place.
I see his love and it's written all over his face.
This has got to be real, 'cause you make me feel.

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I need
to be lovin' you holdin' you feelin' you next to me.
You make me feel so secure,
your love is so pure,
it makes me feel like I need more.
You make me feel so safe,
I couldnt ever let no one come and take your place.
You make me feel, you make feel.

Sometimes I sit and I think about
what my life would be with you without,
without love and affection. 
Without you my life has no direction,
direction to stay on my feet.
Without your love my life has no meaning.
If you were gone, I'd be so alone.

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I need
to be lovin' you holdin' you feelin' you next to me.
You make me feel so secure,
your love is so pure,
it makes me feel like I need more.
You make me feel so safe,
I couldnt ever let no one come and take your place.
You make me feel, you make feel.
