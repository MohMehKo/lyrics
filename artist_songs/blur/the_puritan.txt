Are we institutionalised
By the demands of today?
In our regalia are we ok?

Because the flash of a blade
Is one less getting paid
There in the line
And the ice and gold
Is just a double code
It's a paradigm
For every little thing
That fashion gives you
Yeah

So the puritan
On a Monday morning said
Happy sad melody
I'm waltzing
On an amazing pulse
In a pornographic sea
Where the absent blade
Is one less in parade
To throw overboard
And the ice and gold
Is just a double code
It's a metaphor
For every little thing
That fashion gives you
Yeah

I'm falling into something
That plays upon the metronome
In your heart
It's smoke and it's mirrors
Until the auto cue starts
Then the dry ice comes
And we start sucking our thumbs on the TV
And the joy of people
Spirited away so merrily
Is part of every little thing
That fashion gives you
Yeah

Here we go

La la la, la, la la la, la
La la la, la la
Hey puritan, hey puritan
La la la, la, la la la, la
What you gonna do about it?
La la la la la
It's all smoke and mirrors
La la la, la, la la la, la
What you gonna do about it?
La la la la la
Hey puritan, hey puritan
La la la, la, la la la, la
What you gonna do about it?
La la la la la
La la la, la, la la la, la
What you gonna do about it?
La la la la la
La la la, la, la la la, la
