I love the aspects of another city
The representatives are alright
In circulation the snake and the tiger
Waking up and shaving in industrial life

I broadcast
Buzzing on another day now
All for a cold sore
Something out of nothing

I love the airspace of another city
It's got your number and your blood type
They've been in cages I need some focus
The apparitions of another prodigal night
Right?

I broadcast
Buzzing on another day now
All for a high score
Something out of nothing

I'm running
I'm running
I'm running

I broadcast
Buzzing on another day now
All for a cold sore
Something out of nothing

I broadcast
Buzzing on another day now
All for a cold sore
Something out of nothing
