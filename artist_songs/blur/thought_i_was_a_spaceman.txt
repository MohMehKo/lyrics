Thought I was a spaceman
Digging out my heart
In some distant sand dunes
In a carpark

Cause the desert had encroached upon
The places where we live
People like me find it
To keep the day upset

But we never succeeded
We never succeeded
In fact we failed

Thought I was a spaceman
Digging out my heart
In some distant sand dune
In a car park

By the empty harbor
Where the junkball phantoms flow
The fight for happy valley
Sadly, the line wrote

Thought I found my black box
Washed up on the shore
All outlying islands
What's the land for

Thought I thought I'd found it
But that was not true at all
I'd walked into a bar
Raised hell

Cut the cast without me
Always and always the same
But the ghost in writing
And let it be you again

Thought I was a spaceman
Digging out my heart
In some distant sand dune
In Hyde Park

Thought I was a spaceman
Digging up my heart
In some distant sand dune
You again

Thought I was a spaceman
Digging up my heart
In some distant sand dune
You again

You again
You again
