I remember flashbacks lighting up magic whip
Eight o'clock, Kowloon emptiness, handle it
The wide old sea image I had to view 11 seconds ago
I didn't send you, so you will never know

I got away for a little while
But then it came back much harder

Swinging on the cable line to Po Lin
Climbing down the ghostly wine in a battery
That light in your eyes, I search for religiously
Oh, when it's not there, oh Lord, it's hurting me

I got away for a little while
But then it came back much harder

Till I ever hold you back there again
Will you be mine
Cause I'm on a ghost ship driving my heart
In Hong Kong
It's the last ride boarding here tonight
Out in the bay (out in the bay), I need a lightning in you to shine out
Bright race

Feelin' outta body here, what can I do?
It's up to the top everyday to join here with you

I had to get away for a little while
But then it came back much harder
