And the bright rings we got in summertime
Seemed like a breath of fresh air back in the summertime
When we were more like brothers, that was years ago
So if it doesn't sing like a broken chord

I'm running out of heart today
I'm running out of open road to you
When I know you are emoting and you're dazed
Is something broke inside you, cause at the moment
I'm lost and feeling that I don't know
If I'm losing you again

And when we fly tomorrow over the Java seas
And my younger match will be there with me
Cause they remind me of swimming out too far one day
When the coral was gone, but I didn't care anyway

I was running out of heart that day
I was running out of open road to you
And I know I was emoted, I was dazed
Is something broke inside me, cause at the moment
I'm lost and feeling that I don't know
If I'm losing you again

I'm running out of heartache
Just sitting out the constant doubt in my day
But I don't know what it is
I'm sweating out the toxins
Is my terracotta heart breaking? I don't know
If I'm losing you
If I'm losing you again
