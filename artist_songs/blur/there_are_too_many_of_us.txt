There are too many of us
That’s plain to see
We all believe in praying
For our immortality

We pose this question to our children
That calls them all to stray
And live in tiny houses
Of the same mistakes we make

‘Cause there are too many of us
In tiny houses here and there
Passing out somewhere
But you won’t care

There are too many of us
That’s plain to see
And we all believe in praying
For our immortality

For a moment I was dislocated
By terror on the loop elsewhere
Flashing lights advocate it
On the big screens everywhere

‘Cause there are too many of us
In tiny houses here and there
Just passing out somewhere
But you won’t care

There are too many of us
In tiny houses here and there
All looking through the windows
On everything we share

We pose this question to our children
It leads them out to stray
And live in tiny houses
Of the same mistakes we make

‘Cause there are too many of us
That’s plain to see
All living in tiny houses
Of our immortality
