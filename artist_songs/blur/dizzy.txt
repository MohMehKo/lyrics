I pump poison into my body
To forget that I am me
It felt good
Wonderful
I forget I have feelings at all

You're dizzy
You're dizzy

I floated up, fifteen miles high
Stuck my head through all the holes in our sky
I looked out across the universe and thought of you

You're dizzy
You're dizzy

And I am dizzy too

I became lunatic with rolling eyes
Squirming on the ground
Frozen in ice
Called to my mother
Said "Mother, please
Feed me before the sky falls in on me"

You're dizzy
You're dizzy

You're dizzy
You're dizzy
You're dizzy
You're dizzy
Dizzy
Dizzy
Dizzy
Dizzy
