THE PAY-ME GIRL HAS HAD ENOUGH OF THE BLEEPS
SO SHE TAKES A BUS INTO THE COUNTRY
ALTHOUGH SHE GOT HERSELF ROSY CHEEKS
SHE DIDN'T LEAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY THE RENT
THE LANLORD SAYS THAT SHE'S OUT IN A WEEK
WHAT A SHAME SHE WAS JUST GETTING COMFY
NOW SHE'S EATING CHOCOLATE TO INDUCE SLEEP
IN A CHEMICAL WORLD IT'S VERY, VERY, VERY CHEAP

[CHORUS]
AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU
THEY'VE BEEN PUTTING THE HOLES IN, YES YES
IT'S BEEN A HELL OF A DO
THEY'VE BEEN PUTTING THE HOLES IN, YES YES

PEEPING THOMAS HAS A VERY NICE VIEW
ACROSS THE STREET AT THE EXHIBITIONIST
THESE TOWNIES THEY NEVER SPEAK TO YOU
JUST STICK TOGETHER SO THEY NEVER GET LONELY
FEELING LEAD, FEELING QUITE LIGHT-HEADED
HAD TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE SOME SUGARY TEA
IN CHEMICAL WORLD, IN A CHEMICAL WORLD IT'S VERY, VERY, VERY,
CHEAP.

[CHORUS]
