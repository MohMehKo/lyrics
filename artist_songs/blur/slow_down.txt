It's up to you
You know it is
I can't convince you
All you have to do is
Slow Down
I've always said
It will never change
All you have to do
Just to be you
I think that's all I want to say
All these things
That I told you
I didn't mean at all
I'd forget you
So if you come here
If you come here
All you have to do
Just you be you
I think that's all I need to say to you
