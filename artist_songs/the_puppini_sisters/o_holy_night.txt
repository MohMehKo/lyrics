O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the Soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, oh, hear the angels voices
O night divine, o night when Christ was born
O night divine, o night, o night divine

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains, shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease

Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name
Christ is the Lord, o praise His name forever
His power and glory ever more proclaim
His power and glory ever more proclaim
