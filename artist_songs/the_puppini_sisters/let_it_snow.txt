Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

And when we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home, I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbying
So long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home, I'll be warm

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
Sad, my dear, we're still goodbying
So long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But my dear's so delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stopping, no
And I've got some corn for popping
Turn those lights down low
Let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow

When we finally say goodnight
How I'll hate to be in the storm
But if you'l really hold me tight
All the way home, I'll be warm

Oh, the fire is slowly dying, it's slowly dying
And we're saying goodbye
Just turn my love down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
