Who's the lovely daddy with the beautiful eyes
What a pair of lips, I'd like to try them for size
I'll just tell him, "Baby, won't you swing it with me"
Hope he tells me maybe, what a wing it will be
So, I said politely "Darlin' may I intrude"
He said "Don't keep me waitin' when I'm in the mood"

First he held me lightly and we started to dance
Then he held me tightly what a dreamy romance
And he said "Hey, baby, it's a quarter to three
There's a mess of moonlight, won't cha share it with me"
then I answered "Baby, don't cha know that it's rude
To keep my sisters waitin' when I'm in the mood"

In the mood, that's what he told me
In the mood, and when he told me
In the mood, my heart was skippin'
It didn't take me long to say "I'm in the mood now"

In the mood, for all his kissin'
In the mood, his crazy lovin'
In the mood, what I was missin'
It didn't take me long to say "I'm in the mood now"
