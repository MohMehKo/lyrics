Of all the boys I've known and I've known some
Until I first met you I was lonesome
And when you came in sight, dear my heart grew light
And this ol' world seemed new to me

You're really swell, I have to admit you
These are the expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bei Mir Bist Du Schon, please let me explain
Bei Mir Bist Du Schon, means you're grand
Bei Mir Bist Du Schon, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the la-a-a-and

I could say bella bella, even sir-ir wunderbar
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are
I've tried to explain, Bei Mir Bist Du Schon
So kiss me and say you understand

Bei Mir Bist Du Schon
You've heard it all before but let me try to explain
Bei Mir Bist Du Schon, means that you're grand
Bei Mir Bist Du Schon
It's such an old refrain and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand

I could say bella bella, even sir-ir wunderbar
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

Re-dee, re-dee, re-dee, re-dee, re-dee, re-dee

I could say bella bella, even sir-ir wunderbar
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are
I've tried to explain, Bei Mir Bist Du Schon
So kiss me and say that you will understand...
