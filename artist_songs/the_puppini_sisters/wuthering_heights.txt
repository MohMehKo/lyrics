Out on the wiley, windy moors
We'd roll and fall in green.
You had a temper like my jealousy...
Too hot, too greedy.
How could you leave me,
When I needed to possess you?
I hated you. I loved you, too.

Bad dreams in the night
They told me I was going to lose the fight,
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering
Wuthering Heights.

Heathcliff, don't you know that it's me, it's Cathy, I've come home.
I'm so cold, let me in-a-your window.

Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy, I've come home.
I'm so cold, let me in-a-your window.

Ooh, it gets dark! It gets lonely,
On the other side from you.
I pine a lot. I find the lot
Falls through without you.
I'm coming back, love,
Cruel Heathcliff, my one dream,
My only master.

Too long I roamed in the night.
I'm coming back to his side, to put it right.
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering
Wuthering Heights,

Heathcliff, don't you know that it's me, it's Cathy, I've come home.
I'm so cold, let me in-a-your window.

Heathcliff, don't you know that it's me, it's Cathy, I've come home.
I'm so cold, let me in-a-your window.

Ooh! Let me have it.
Let me grab your soul away.
Ooh! Let me have it.
Let me grab your soul away.
You know it's me--Cathy!

Heathcliff, don't you know that it's me, it's Cathy, I've come home.
I'm so cold, let me in-a-your window.

Heathcliff, don't you know that it's me, it's Cathy, I've come home.
I'm so cold, let me in-a-your window.
Let me in-a-your window
Let me in-a-your window
Let me in-a-your window
Let me in-a-your window
