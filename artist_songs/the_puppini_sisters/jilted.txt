I bought another dinner for one
I sit and watch some pointless re-run
And the tears fall down
'Cause this is not what I had planned

I stare at all the books on the shelf
On how to help or better myself
Lot of good they've done
Another one's gone to hell

Hmmm I've been jilted again
He packed his bags and left whistling a happy song
I jumped through hoops to keep that man
Oh how did I get it so wrong?

I tried new positions
I learned his friends names
I made myself sit through football games
Oh, Been jilted
Been jilted again

So this is when self pity sets in
And ominous predictions begin
Will I end my days alone and reaching for the gin?

Talking to myself and the cat
Weeping at the drop of a hat
Oh for goodness sake
I can do better than that

Hmmm I've been jilted again
He packed his bags and left whistling a happy song
I jumped through hoops to keep that man
Oh how did I get it so wrong?

I tried new positions
I learned his friends names
I made myself sit through football games
Oh, Been jilted
Been jilted again

[Scat]

Well things are gonna change from now on
I think those self help books are a con
So be sure next time my geisha ways will all be gone

Oh, try to please and always be nice
Oh, trust the Cosmo quiz for advice
I'll just be myself
And see if that will suffice

Hmm I've been jilted again
But hey, good riddance I don't think that he was meant for me
I jumped through hoops to keep that man
But now he's gone I'm finally free

To try new ambitions
And learn new friends names
And wash my hair through those football games

Hmmm, been jilted
Good riddance
Been jilted again
