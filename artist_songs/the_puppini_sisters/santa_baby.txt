Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree for me
Been an awful good girl
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellows that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
Been an angel all year
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, there's one thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my chirstmas tree
With some decorations bought from Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
So let's see if you believe in me

Santa baby, fill my stocking with a duplex and checks
Sign your x on the line
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring
I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby and hurry down the chimney tonight
And hurry down the chimney tonight
And hurry... tonight
