Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,
Right down Santa Claus lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
Pullin' on the reins
Bells are ringin', children singin'
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say your prayers
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight!

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,
Right down Santa Claus lane
He's got a bag that's filled with toys
For the boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle,
Oh what a beautiful sight
Jump in bed, cover up your head
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight, tonight!
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight!

Happy days, happy times
Listen to the bells and chimes
As Santa Clause comes your way, today

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,
Right down Santa Claus lane
He doesn't care if you're rich or poor
He loves you just the same
Santa Claus knows that we're God's children
That makes everything right
Fill your hearts with a Christmas cheer
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight, tonight!
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight!
Santa Claus is coming tonight, Santa!

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,
Right down Santa Claus lane
He'll come around when the chimes ring out
That it's Christmas morn again
Peace on earth will come to all
If we just follow the lights
Let's give thanks to the Lord above
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight!

Happy days, happy times
Listen to the bells and chimes
Here Comes Santa Claus!
