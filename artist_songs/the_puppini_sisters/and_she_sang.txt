There was a girl who thought the world
Was filled with gold and pearls
She smiled with the bright eyes
Of those who trust in life
She had been taught she should believe
In all that's good and fair
And and the end of each day
She sat contented in her chair

And she sang; lalalalalala

He was the type who thought he had a right
To everything he liked
He had an easy air, was confident
And pleasing to the eye
They met by chance at a cafÂ©
He thought that she looked fine
And as they kissed she felt the bliss
Of love for the first time

And she sang; lalalalalala

She gave herself without reserve,
With eagerness and joy
He took her with indifference
Then cast her off like a broken toy

There was a girl who thought the world
Was filled with gold and pearls
She smiled with hazy eyes
And lips that barely curled
She had been taught she should believe
And so her life went on
And through the years she still could hear
The echo of her song

Lalalalalala
