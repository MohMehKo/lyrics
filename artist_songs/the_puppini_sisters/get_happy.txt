Forget your troubles, come on get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy
Get ready for the judgment day
Get ready for the judgment day

The sun is shinin', come on get happy
The Lord is waitin' to take your hand
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy
We're going to the promise land
We're going to the promise land

We're headin' across the river
Wash your sins away in the tide
It's all so peaceful on the other side

Forget your troubles, come on get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy
Get ready for the judgment day
Get ready for the judgment day

The sun is shinin', come on get happy
The Lord is waitin' to take your hand
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy
We're going to the promise land
We're going to the promise land

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
All you sinners, gather 'round
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
All you sinners I have found
Found a land where, where the weary
Forever are free
Come you sinners, come you sinners
Come you sinners and just follow me

Forget your troubles, come on get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy
Get ready for the judgment day
Get ready for the judgment day
Get ready for the judgment day
Get ready for the judgment day
