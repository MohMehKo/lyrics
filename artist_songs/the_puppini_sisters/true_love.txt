Sun-tanned, wind-blown
Honeymooners at last alone
Feeling far above par
Oh, how lucky we are!

While I give to you and you give to me
True love, true love

So on and on it'll always be
True love, true love

For you and I
Have a guardian angel on high
With nothin' to do

But to give to you and to give to me
Love forever true

For you and I
Have a guardian angel on high
With nothin' to do

But to give to you and to give to me
Love forever true
Love forever true
