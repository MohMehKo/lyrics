But then his number came up and he was gone with the draft.
He's in the army now. he's blowin' reveille.
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B.

They made him blow a bugle for his uncle sam.
It really brought him down because he could not jam.
The captain seemed to understand,
Because the next day the cap' went out and drafted the band.
And now the company jumps when he plays reveille.
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B.

A root, a toot, a toodlie-a-da-toot.
He blows it eight to the bar in boogie rhythm.
He can't blow a note unless a bass and guitar
Is playin' with him.
And the company jumps when he plays reveille.
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B.
