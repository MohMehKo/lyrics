You'll find the fame
If you leave what's behind you
How you gonna be
How you gonna feel
When you're in Hollywood

Lights, camera, action
Double take on camera star
How you gonna play
What you gonna say
When you're in Hollywood

If you don't know
You won't know
Things will awake you
Play it safe or take the part

Hollywood mon amour
Hollywood don't don't go
Hollywood, Hollywood
Hollywood ooooh
Hollywood mon amour
Hollywood don't don't go
Hollywood drama
Hollywood needs
Hollywood everything I want to be

Don't be afraid
You can have all you always dreamed of
If you only say
What you gotta say
When you're in Hollywood

Remember forever
Your name in the walk of fame
If you only say
What you gotta say
When you're in Hollywood

If you don't know
You won't know
Things will awake you
Play it safe or take the part

Hollywood mon amour
Hollywood don't don't go
Hollywood, Hollywood
Hollywood ooooh
Hollywood mon amour
Hollywood don't don't go
Hollywood drama
Hollywood needs
Hollywood everything I want to be

Are you ready to shine
Can you handle the light
Don't be scared of the height
You can fly

Are you ready to shine
Can you handle the light
Don't be scared of the height
You can fly

Hollywood mon amour
Hollywood don't don't go
Hollywood, Hollywood
Hollywood ooooh
Hollywood mon amour
Hollywood don't don't go
Hollywood drama
Hollywood needs
Hollywood everything I want to

Hollywood mon amour
Hollywood don't don't go
Hollywood, Hollywood
Hollywood ooooh
Hollywood mon amour
Hollywood don't don't go
Hollywood drama
Hollywood needs
Hollywood everything I want to be
