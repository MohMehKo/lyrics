Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out, I had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Much mistrust, love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon turned out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Much mistrust, love's gone behind

In between
What I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you
It's just no good, you teasing me like you do

[First verse]

Lost inside
Adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using, please don't push me aside
We coulda made it cruising, yeah

Riding high on love's true bluish light
