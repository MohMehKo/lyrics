Spirits move me, everytime I'm near you
Whirling like a cyclone in my mind
You are my lifeline, angel of a lifetime
Answer to all answers that I could find

Baby, I want you, come, come
Won't you just come into my arms?
Let me feel the wonder of all of you
Could it be magic now, now
Now and hold on fast?
Could this be the magic at last?

Baby, take me high upon the hillside
High up where the stallion meets the sun
You won't believe me but I know I could love you
Build my whole world around you
Never leave you till my life is gone

Baby, I want you, come, come
Come into my arms.
Let me feel the wonder of all of you
Could it be magic now, now
Now and hold on fast?
Could this be the magic at last?
