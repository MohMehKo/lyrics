Far beyond was a time of fame, a time of joy
But for now, only dark days and nights spent cold and shivering
Working the corner at a quarter to three
With nothing but an old friend and some long memories
She sits by the roadside with a cup in her hand
She'll never stop living the life

It's not over, so don't give up the fight
It's not over, some day you'll see it right
Though the times you were loved and adored by the crowd
Are all gone, it's not over, so don't give up the fight

There's no past time that overcomes the fantasies
Of a girl, with the world in the hands of her sweet melodies
All those who loved her have forgotten her name
A shadow of a person in some novelty game
But now her sole possession brings her nothing but strife
She still can't stop living the life

It's not over, so don't give up the fight
It's not over, some day you'll see it right
Though the times you were loved and adored by the crowd
Are all gone, it's not over, so don't give up the fight

Far beyond was a time of fame, a time of joy
But for now, only dark days and nights spent cold and shivering
Cold winter nights begin to play with the mind
No source of warmth but only her companion besides
It's death or the toy piano burns in the flames
She's got to stop living the life

It's not over, so don't give up the fight
It's not over, some day you'll see it right
Though the times you were loved and adored by the crowd
Are all gone, it's not over, so don't give up the fight

It's not over, so don't give up the fight
It's not over, some day you'll see it right
Though the times you were loved and adored by the crowd
Are all gone, it's not over, so don't give up the fight
