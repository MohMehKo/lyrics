I don't care what the weather man says,
When the weatherman says it's raining,
You'll never hear me complaining,
I'm certain the sun will shine,
I don't care how the weather vane points,
When the weather vane points to gloomy,
It's gotta be sunny to me, when your eyes look into mine; oh
Jeepers Creepers! Where'd ya get those peepers?
Jeepers Creepers! Where'd ya get those eyes?
Gosh all git up! How'd they get so lit up?
Gosh all git up! How'd they get that size?
Golly gee! When you turn those heaters on,
Woe is me!
Got to get my cheaters on, Jeepers Creepers!
Where'd ya get those peepers? On! Those weepers!
How they hypnotize!
Where'd ya get those eyes?
