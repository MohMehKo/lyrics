The French are glad to die for love
They delight in fighting duels
But I prefer a man who lives and gives
Expensive jewels

A kiss on the hand may be quite continental
But diamonds are a girl's best friend
A kiss may be grand... but it won't pay the rental on your humble flat
Or help you at the automat

Men grow cold as girls grow old
And we all lose our charms in the end
But square cut or pear shape these rocks don't lose their shape
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

Tiffany's!
Cartier!
Black star Frost Gorham
Talk to me, Harry Winston, tell me all about it!

There may come a time when a lass needs a lawyer
But diamonds are a girl's best friend
There may come a time when a hard boiled employer
Thinks you're awful nice
But get that ice or else no dice

He's your guy when stocks are high
But beware when they start to descend
It's then that those louses go back to their spouses
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

I've heard of affairs that are strictly platonic
But diamonds are a girl's best friend
And I think affairs that you must keep liaisonic
Are better bets if little pets get big baguettes

Time rolls on and youth is gone
And you can't straighten up when you bend
But stiff back or stiff knees you stand straight at... Tiffany's

Diamonds... diamonds...
I don't mean rhinestones but diamonds
Are a girl's best friend
