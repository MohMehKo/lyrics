Welcome to my Christmas song
I'd like to thank you for the years
So I'm sending you this Christmas card
To say it's very nice to have you here

I'd like to sing about all the things
Your eyes and mind can see
So hop aboard the turntable
You gotta hop aboard the turntable
You gotta hop aboard the turntable

You gotta oh, oh, oh, oh
Step into Christmas with me

Step into Christmas, let's do it together
We can watch the snow fall forever and ever
Eat, drink and be merry
Come, come along with me
Step into Christmas, the admission is free

Take care in all you do next year
And keep smiling through the days
If we can help to entertain you
Oh, we will find the ways

So merry Christmas one and all
There's no place I'd rather be
Than asking you if you'd oblige
Than asking, asking you if you'd oblige
Than asking, asking you if you'd oblige

You'll have a oh, oh, oh, oh
Stepping into Christmas with me

Step into Christmas, let's do it together
We can watch the snow fall forever and ever
Eat, drink and be merry
Come, come along with me
Step into Christmas, the admission is free

You gotta step right up, gotta step right in
Step into Christmas with me
