Hear me when I say
Girl Get Out
Baby, you can't stay
Ayy, Girl get out
Ayy
Ayy

Wouldn't try to trip,
Enough for you to dip
You used to be a nympho,
But now I can't hit
Sorry, silly rabbit but these Trix right here for kids
You're living in a dream world like Dorothy off the Wiz

[Bridge:]
And I
I bet you thought you really had it made
Leave my house
You thought that you were fucking with a lame
Trick it out
I must admit this shit was entertaining
But you can't win the game
If you the only one playing

[Chorus:]
Gave you what you want
Yeah
Get you out the street
Yeah
I've been grindin too hard to listen to you complain to me
Got you poppin tags
Yeah
Gave you everything
Yeah
[?] star but you gone Hollywood
What about what I need
This ain't what I want [x3]

Now you tryna flip
Talking bout what if
If this was a fifth girl
We'd be drunk as shit
But I ain't drink a lick
Girl you think you slick
I'm Standing at the front door
Pack them bags quick, let's go

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Nanananana
Hey hey hey
Good bye [x2]

Go ahead and leave the keys to the tip
That number nine bus is your new whip
Don't let the door go and hit ya
Where the good Lord split ya
Promise you that this is really it

[Chorus]
