It's so erotic, watching you wind,
Ooh the way your handling
Your fingers start turning me on (me on) [x4]

And it's amazing what you do with your...
I can tell it can be even better when your clothes come off (come off) [x4]

Now I know you a winner and I can't lose
Cause I've been set up in this corner
Watching you do what you do
And I don't wanna waste time
Girl I'm ready to move come on
Tell me your with it (with it) [x4]

I wanna see you take it all off for me
Take it all off for me
Take it all off for me [x2]

I want to keep you for the rest of the night
If u got plans later on then go ahead and free up (free up) [x5]
And I was thinking we could take a ride
And you could come into my crib and give me some...

Ooh baby ooh
I wanna see u take your time
Show me everything u can do
If it's cool baby
Tell me your with it (with it) [x4]

I wanna see you take it all off for me
Take it all off for me
Take it all off for me [x2]

One shot two shot three and four
Shawty tell you girls that you gotta go
Cause we ready n u ready
So we heading out
I got the tequila in me
So tonight it's going down

I wanna see you take it all off for me
Take it all off for me
Take it all off for me [x2]
