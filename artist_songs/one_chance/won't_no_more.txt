All day yesterday, couldn't help but think about,
If I caused you to leave me girl
All at once it came to me, that I just can't live without
You being all up in my world.
You been better to me than anybody else.
I know I deserve to be left here by myself.
From this day on I swear I'm turning things around
Baby just come back in this house
And let's work it out

I know I told you that I wouldn't lie before
And I won't no more
(Won't no more, no more)
Sometimes when I get busy I ignore your calls
But I won't no more
(Won't no more)
See I wouldn't understand it, but finally I get it
I don't want you leaving, baby please believe me.
No more, no more, no more, no more
Girl I swear I won't no more.

Acting like a fool, nearly pushing you away
What the hell is wrong with me
Breaking all the rules, always gotta have my way
What the hell was wrong me
You been letting me slide, giving me a pass
Know I couldn't survive, if I lost that ass
This time I mean it, I'm a turn this thing around
Please just come back in this house,
And let's work it out

[?]
And I won't no more
Sometimes you [?] and I don't show respect
And I won't no more
See I wouldn't understand it, but finally I get it
I don't want you leaving, baby please believe me
No more, no more, no more
Girl I swear I won't no more

I know it ain't been easy, for you to put up with me
And all the things I've done wrong, no apologies
But right here right now, promise I'm a be a better man
And baby you gone see a change
And no matter what I gotta do
I'm a do it just to prove, baby girl no matter what it's all about you
So no more fighting and no more crying
No more doing like I used to do

[?]
And I won't no more
I took for granted that you'd always be with me
But I won't no more, I promise that I won't no more
See I wouldn't understand it, but finally I get it
I don't want you leaving, baby please believe it
No more, no more, no more
Girl I swear I won't no more

I won't do it no more baby...
