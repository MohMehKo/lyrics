[Intro:]
I should've known the deal
Didn't think it was real
But now I know how it feels

I should've known the deal
Didn't think it was real
But now I know how it feels

[Verse 1:]
Yeahh Oh
She said she's leaving
She ain't give me a reason she just walked out the door
And I ain't been sleeping no
Trying to figure out why
Why she don't love me no more
I can't take the pain
I, don't like the change
I, said I moved on but things just ain't the same
I, I love her and I don't want to hurt no more

[Hook:]
I want to take this time
To apologize to every women that I ever hurt
Cause lord knows I told a lot of lies
I cheated and I did a whole lot of dirt

[Chorus:]
But now I know how it feels
To lose a lover
Someone that truly loves ya
I wish I didn't have to go out like that
But now I know how it's feels
To love somebody
To really love somebody
And find out they ain't loving you back
But now I know how it feels
And I ain't ever felt this way before
And I don't want to feel this way no more
But now I know how it feels (More)
I knew it was real, yeah
But now I know how it feels

[Verse 2:]
I walked her into the mansions
And introduced her to Hollywood
Put her on the red carpet
But I guess it didn't do a lot of good
Because the money didn't mean nothing (she needed love)
I, put her in front of cameras
And now everybody is saying that
We look so good together
But that ain't gone bring my baby back yeah
Because she ain't my girl no more

[Hook:]
Sooo, I'm gonna take this time
To apologize to every women I ever hurt, hey
Cause lord knows I told a lot of lies
I cheated and I did a whole lot of dirt, yeah

[Chorus:]
But now I know how it feels
To lose a lover
Someone that who loves ya
I wish I didn't have to go out like that, eh
But now I know how it's feels
To love somebody
To really love somebody
And find out they ain't loving you back, yeah yeah
But now I know how it feels
And I ain't ever felt this way before
And I don't want to feel this way no more
But now I know how it feels (More)
I knew it was real, ohh
But now I know how it feels

[Outro:]
If I'm man enough to say I'm sorry
You should be women enough to take me back
If I'm man enough to say that I'm sorry
You should be women enough to take me back
I lied, but you cried
But you tried to heal the hurt inside
I knew that she was real
But know I know how it feels
