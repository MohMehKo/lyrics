[Verse 1:]
I know we ain't talked in a while give me a minute,
I got something on my chest to get off I need u to listen (like),
It got me trippin' like, even got a nigga sippin like, can't get it off my mind (mind),
Can't even sleep at night.I tried talking to my momma, my friends and the paster.
No one gave any good advice so I'm getting at ya,
Because I'm so confused, I don't know what to do.
Like comparing a bently to a Honda can't compare the 2,

[Bridge:]
I don't know how we got like this,
But I know that is serious,
Choosing who to be with,
Living being sleepless,
So can u help me, better yet tell me

One girl is my jump off one girl is my wife,
But I have fell in love with both and I can't decide,
So tell me what to do, cause I don't know which one to choose
I just don't know
One girl is my jump off one girl is my wife,
But I have fell in love with both and I can't decide,
So tell me what to do, cause I don't know which one to choose
I just don't know

[Verse 2:]
I was scared I was falling to deep off in my pimpin',
If I can't play Russian roulette with all of these women like,
I guess I broke the rule, cause I ain't play it cool,
But that ain't no excuse, that's just what I do,
I even think u was tryin to teach me a lesson,
I don't appreciate what I got or recognize a blessing,
If so I see it now and plus I'm bleeding now,
If you are show me a sign to help me figure out.

Stuck, stuck between the two cause I can't pick one,
