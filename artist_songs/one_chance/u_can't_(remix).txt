And it be slantin, the phantom be bammin and I step up out that bitch like I just landed
Cause I'm flyer than everybody in your damn family, now girl shake that booty meat and I'm a make a sandwich
Ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, syrup and crunk juice

My name is weezy baby, and don't forget the baby.
If you forget the baby, I'm a forget you baby.

[Chorus till song fades]
