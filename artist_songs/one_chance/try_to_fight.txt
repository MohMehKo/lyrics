The more that I try to fight the more I start to bruise
Said it's beating me up I ain't tryna lose
The longer I stay with her worse it is for me
I'm not the type to love cause loving ain't easy
I tried to look at her and tell myself I'm done with her
You see I'm lying cause I know that I'm the one for her
Cause she's just like me and I just might be
Might be sinking in this love that I'm in

I guess I gotta go somewhere that I've never been
Cause I've tried to fight and get back up but she keeps pulling me in
Her love's like quick sand
It keeps pulling me in, it's just pulling me in yeah
It keeps pulling me yeah, she just keeps pulling me yeah
It keeps pulling me yeah, yeah

Every time that I talk to her feels brand new
And when she touches to me it's like I can't move
It's crazy how her smile erases my memory
And it makes me forget everything that was stressing me
I tried to look at her and tell myself I'm done with her
You see I'm lying cause I know that I'm the one for her
Cause she's just like me and I just might be
Might be sinking in this love that I'm in

I guess I gotta go somewhere that I've never been
Cause I've tried to fight and get back up but she keeps pulling me in
Her love's like quick sand
It keeps pulling me in, it's just pulling me in yeah
It keeps pulling me yeah, she just keeps pulling me yeah
It keeps pulling me yeah, yeah

And I don't know what I ever did to deserve this
I can't stop the feelings even if I tried
I'm tryna run away now but I'm scared to lose her
Know it would be worse if I fell deeper in love

The more that I try to fight the more I start to bruise
Said it's beating me up, I ain't tryna lose
The longer I stay with her, worse it is for me
I'm not the type to love cause loving ain't easy
I tried to look at her and tell myself I'm done with her
You see I'm lying cause I know that I'm the one for her
Cause she's just like me and I just might be
Might be sinking in this love that I'm in

I guess I gotta go somewhere that I've never been
Cause I've tried to fight and get back up but she keeps pulling me in
Her love's like quick sand
It keeps pulling me in, it's just pulling me in yeah
It keeps pulling me yeah, she just keeps pulling me yeah
It keeps pulling me yeah, yeah
