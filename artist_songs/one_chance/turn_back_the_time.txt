I was never meanin to do it
How could I ever be so foolish
To throw away what was proven
Never really thought about living my life without her
There's no excuse cause I knew it
And now I'm starting to lose it
I'm becoming unravel influent
I would do anything to have never put you through it
But it's too late now
How I ask myself why did I not believe in you
And I'm feeling way down
Cause I'm thinking about the days in my life of receiving you

If I could turn back the hands of time
Baby I'll rewind every clip of you
I would of never lied to you
Tears in my eyes for you
I know that I should of cherish you
I look at my life
In a different light
And I gotta change cause it just ain't right
Wanna turn back time(turn back time)
I should I turn back time

And now that I'm looking back on the other days
I realize precious time is slipping away
Never knew just what would become of me
I wasn't half of the man I was supposed to be
And it hurts to even think of myself
What I did, how I did, if I would of, should of
Taken back all the pain I be done to you
What do I gotta do to bring it back to you

If I could turn back the hands of time
Baby I'll rewind every clip of you
I would of never lie to you
Tears in my eyes for you
I know that I should of cherish you
I look at my life
In a different light
I gotta change cause this just ain't right
I wanna turn back time(turn back time)

And now I lost my eyes and I drift away
To a place where I reflect all the major space
I revenge in on my life only what I pray for
To be blessed of you once more
Oh baby, only you
You kno I wanna be I wanna be I wanna

If I could turn back the hands of time
Baby I'll rewind every clip of you
I would of never lied to you
Tears in my eyes for you
I know that I should of cherish you
I look at my life
In a different life
And I gotta change cause it just ain't right
Wanna turn back time(turn back turn)
I should I turn back time
