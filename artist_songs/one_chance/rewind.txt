When I saw you round the way girl,
I didn't know your name so I just say (hey),
That's when you started walking closer,
Girl I didn't know what to say,
And I ain't ever met a girl like you before,
Pretty in the face with a body like (hey),
Now let me whipser in your ear,
I got something I think you should hear,

You ain't never ever have it like this before,
Not bragging girl I'm stating facts,
Girl I got what your looking for,
That shit that keep you coming back,
Saying do it again and again and again,
She wanna do it again and again and again, [x3]
She want that rewind,

After I done lay it down now,
She call me in the middle of the night like (hey),
Tellin me that she feein',
And how bad she needs it,
She wants it again,
Can I tell you a secret,
It's better girl to take your time,
Let me put it in your life,
And give it to you just the way you like it,

You ain't never ever have it like this before,
Not bragging girl I'm stating facts,
Girl I got what your looking for,
That shit that keep you coming back,
Saying do it again and again and again,
She wanna do it again and again and again, [x3]
She want that rewind,

I'm not talking if I can't back it up,
Baby I'm good to go,
When I get you in the room no talking,
Baby just back it up,
We can do it fast or slow,
I know them other guys can't do it like I do,
Let me know if you don't feel the same,
And girl I'm gonna give you the best,
Put you to the test,
Over and over til I hear you say,
She want that rewind,

You ain't never ever have it like this before,
Not bragging girl I'm stating facts,
Girl I got what your looking for,
That shit that keep you coming back,
Saying do it again and again and again,
She wanna do it again and again and again, [x3]
She want that rewind,

You ain't never ever have it like this before,
Not bragging girl I'm stating facts,
Girl I got what your looking for,
That shit that keep you coming back,
Saying do it again and again and again,
She wanna do it again and again and again, [x3]
She want that rewind
