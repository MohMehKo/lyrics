Girl forget about him [x2]

Baby come and tell me what's exactly on your mind
Amd if you want my answer first, then girl it's your behind.
See girl I wanna take you where no other man can,
Your my Tinkerbell, and I'm your Peter Pan.

Let's go to Neverland,
Baby come run away with me.
Whisper in my ear, tell me all your fantasies.
Let's go to Neverland,
Girl I know I turn you on.
I don't like the way you're looking girl, what's wrong?

If you say you got a man (girl forget about him)
If he ain't put that ring up on your hand (girl forget about him)
If you up in the club with them single ladies,
You should. Oooh girl. Oooh girl.

Girl forget about him. Girl forget about him. Girl forget-get. forget about him
If you say you got a man. If you say you got a man.

Baby I don't know why you keep putting up with his lies.
But we can talk about it when we sippin' on some wine.
Cause girl I wanna take you somewhere that you can only go in your dreams,
Just you and me...

Let's go to Neverland,
Baby come run away with me.
Whisper in my ear, tell me all your fantasies.
Let's go to Neverland,
Girl I know I turn you on.
I don't like the way you're looking girl, what's wrong?

If you say you got a man (girl forget about him)
If he ain't put that ring up on your hand (girl forget about him)
If you up in the club with them single ladies,
You should. Oooh girl. Oooh girl.

Girl forget about him. Girl forget about him. Girl forget-get. forget about him
If you say you got a man. If you say you got a man.

If you say you got a man (girl forget about him)
If he ain't put that ring up on your hand (girl forget about him)
If you up in the club with them single ladies,
You should. Oooh girl. Oooh girl.

Girl forget about him. Girl forget about him. Girl forget-get. forget about him
If you say you got a man. If you say you got a man.
