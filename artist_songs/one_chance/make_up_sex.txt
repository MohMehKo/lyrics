[Verse 1:]
Baby Wait,
Before you get the cussing and we fight
Tell me what's on your mind
What I do now
Yea I know you saw me grin but you couldn't know how sexy you is
Right Now you looking mean and you trying to be so mad
But the only thing I see is my baby is so bad
I wanna stop her before she next the word
Grab her and get to touching on her
Hold her and get the rubbing on her
In the minute I gonna put some loving on her

[Bridge:]
Cause sexy to me when she be acting up
Then she get to fussing and screaming
While she cussing at me
I'm only watching her breath and the her sweat roll down her body
So mad she reaching her peak
And we making up in the sheets
Because

[Chorus:]
Ain't nothing better then
Make Up sex
When she be buggin I let her
Then Make up sex
After the fussing and the fighting
Make up sex
Turn off the lights and take off her clothes and
Make up Sex girl
[Repeat]

[Verse 2:]
So baby stop before you finish girl
I gotta cut you off before you even say another word
Baby all the tension is only turning up meter girl
And from the look in your eyes you feel the temperature rise... I'm bout to beat it up
Baby grab me by my belt, as I pull on your hair
You show me how you really felt
No it's not bout romance
Cause now it's time for putting in work
Grab her and get to touching on her
Hold her and get the rubbing on her
In the minute I gonna put some loving on her

[Bridge:]
Cause sexy to me when she be acting up
Then she get to fussing and screaming
While she cussing at me
I'm only watching her breath and the her sweat roll down her body
So mad she reaching her peak
And we making up in the sheets
Because

[Chorus:]
Ain't nothing better then
Make Up sex
When she be buggin I let her
Then Make up sex
After the fussing and the fighting
Make up sex
Turn off the lights and take off her clothes and
Make up Sex Girl

She giving me the eye when she looking at me
And even though she mad she so ready and
But it's the best when it's make up sex baby

[Chorus:]
Ain't nothing better then
Make Up sex
When she be buggin I let her
Then Make up sex
After the fussing and the fighting
Then Make up sex
Turn off the lights and take off her clothes and
Make up Sex
