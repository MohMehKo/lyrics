No ohh ohh no ohh oh
Why, why you at home crying every night
Why you let him [?]
Why you let him cheat ya
Why you let him beat ya
Why you staying with him
Girl why

Why you hiding what you feel inside
Why you don't deserve better
Girl why
You put up with the games
You let him do his thing
Baby I just gotta know why baby

Why do you let him disrespect you
Like you're not a woman
Oh baby why
And why do you let him put his hands on you
Like you a rag doll
Oh baby girl why
Why you let him do it
Why you go through it
Baby I just wanna know why
Why you let him degrade you
And act like he made you
Baby ask yourself why

Oh why'd you let him go and black your eye
Why don't you even put up a fight
Why'd you have his baby
And why you still his lady
And why not take the kids and just ride
And why you stay at home alone at night
While he go run the streets, that ain't right
Why you live like a child
He's tearing you down
Oh baby I just wanna know why

Why do you let him disrespect you
Like you're not a woman
Oh baby why
And why do you let him put his hands on you
Like you a rag doll
Oh baby girl why
Why you let him do it
Why you go through it
Baby I just wanna know why
Why you let him degrade you
And act like he made you
Baby ask yourself why

And I know there's a feeling
Of obligation in a relationship
But you don't wanna get to the point
Where you're just foolish (hey)
I know it's gonna hurt
When you think about the good times in the past
But you can't let a man mistreat you
Even if you feel he's all that you have
Tell me why
Why why why

Why do you let him disrespect you
Like you're not a woman
Oh baby why
And why do you let him put his hands on you
Like you a rag doll
Oh baby girl why
Why you let him do it
Why you go through it
Baby I just wanna know why
Why you let him degrade you
And act like he made you
Baby ask yourself why

Why you let him do it
Why you go through it
Why
Why you let him do it
He don't deserve you
No no
Why you let him do it
Why you go through it
Why you let him do it
Why
