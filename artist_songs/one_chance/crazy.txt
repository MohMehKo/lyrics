[Verse 1: Rob]
What if I cheated on you?
And risk everything for a little,
Temporary piece of something that,
Doesn't come close to you.

What if I broke your heart?
And just threw away all the loving,
Your trust, your belief in us.
Though you know I'm not a fool.

[Pre-Chorus: Adlibs-Rob]
You know that I willing never leave you.
And We've both know that I need you. (Need, Aye)
And That ain't gonna change. (Listen Baby)
So let me explain I'll be...

[Chorus: Adlibs-Rob]
I'll be Cra-zzzzzzzy, (Crazy to let you go)
Crazy to let you go.
Cra-zzzzzzzzy,
Crazy to let you walk away.
And take my love away, (And take my love a)
With nothing else to say (With nothing else to)
Girl there ain't know way (Heyyyy)

I'll be Cra-zzzzzzzy, (I'll be crazzzzzzy)
Cra-zzzzzzzzy, (Oh yes you did)
I just can't do it, (No!)
No I can't do it, (No!)
No I'm not losing you (No!)
I'll refuse that's Crazy (Yes)

[Verse 2: Mic]
See sometimes I made you cry.
And deep inside I died,
With every tear that drops from your face.
I just wanna wash the pain away.

I'd rather hurt myself.
And I'll never love someone else,
And I refuse to let you go.
Girl you know I'll be...

[Chorus: Adlibs-Mic]
I'll be Cra-zzzzzzzy, (Crazy)
Crazy to let you go.
Cra-zzzzzzzzy, (Crazy)
Crazy to let you walk away. (Walk away)
And take my love away, (No)
With nothing left to say. (Heeeyyy)
Girl there ain't know way

I'll be Cra-zzzzzzzy, (I'll be Crazzzzy)(Oooooooh)Cra-zzzzzzzzy, (I just can't do it)
I just can't do it, (Hey!)
No I can't do it, (Hey!)
No I'm not losing you (Hey!)
I'll refuse that's Crazy

[Bridge: Adlibs-Courtney]
Baby can't you see that (Can't you see)
I could never be that (Crazy)
Oh No (Oh No), Not Me (Not Me)
Never, never, No, No baby

I can never,
No never
Not me, I'm not (Crazy)

Girl I'll have to be crazy.

[Chorus: Adlibs-Courtney]
I'll be Cra-zzzzzzzy, (Crazy)
Crazy to let you go. (Oh)

Crazy to let you walk away, (Walk away)
And take my love away, (away)
With nothing left to say. (to say)
Girl there ain't know way (I'll be crazy)
