[Interlude:]
Why you looking so sad baby? (Woaaah...Ye-Ye-Yeaaah)
What you really need to do, 
Is let me take you on a date (Woaaah) (I'll show you everything)
You know, matter of fact I gotta show you better than I could tell you
(And I wanna know, and I wanna know, and i wanna know...)
So, c'mon let's take a ride (oh baby...)
(Let me take you on a, take you on a, take you on a...)

[Verse 1:]
I see you walking with your high heels on baby girl,
Yeah you set the world on fire (Aaaye...aaaye) (No-oh no no...)
I see you moving down the street with your swag just steppin'
Head's turned around can't nobody tell you nothin'
Yeah I know you gotta do it how you do it
Runnin' like you flew with, the stupid!

[Bridge:]
(But I wanna know...)
If you doin' alright
(And I wanna know...)
If you havin' fun tonight
Coz the first time I looked at your face,
I didn't see you smilin'

(And I wanna know...)
If you feelin' all good
(Girl, I wanna know...)
If you'll love it like you should
Girl! I wanna be there for you,
To show you something different

[Chorus:]
Let me take you on a date (date, date...)
Show you how a real man's supposed to be
Girl I won't be late (late, late...)
I'll show everything you're supposed to see
Let me take you on a date (date, date...)
Show you how a real man's supposed to be
I wanna be there for you (I'll show everything you're supposed to see...)
Let me take you on a...

[Verse 2]
(No, no...) 
No need to worry 'bout tomorrow
I've got it all locked-down (Ooh, breakfast in bed...)
I gotta do it my style, Yeah-yeaaah! (Ooh)
No need to worry about the future baby,
Coz I'm thinkin' 'bout your dreams 
Twenty-f-four-seven-seven-ninety-three-eleven, girl...
I've got it all locked-down!

[Repeat Bridge]

[Repeat Chorus]

[Ad lib:]
So, I told you I could show you better than I can tell you
Yeah, I see you smilin' baby, it's all good
But check this out, this day ain't gotta end
It can last forever so, just know, it's okay
Smile and...

[Repeat Chorus]

[Ad lib:]
Baby, I just want to let you know,
Before I let you go, can I get a kiss goodnight?!
One Chance!
