Could, Could, could this be love
Could, Could, could this be love
Could, Could, could this be love

[Verse 1:]
The first time I saw you girl
I knew that
You'd be the one to change my world
I'm so into you
And everything I had before

[Hook:]
Everything I had before
Was nothing more
Than infactuation (oh yeah yeah)
But when you came through that door
I became sure
Of what I was to do

[Chorus:]
Could this be love
Cause I never ever felt this way
Could this be love
Could it be love
And if so I want this feeling to stay
Could this be love

[Verse 2:]
I tried, I tried to walk away
From you,
But my heart controls the things I say and do
I'm so into you
And everything I had before

[Hook:]
Everything I had before
Was nothing more
Than infactuation
But when you came through that door
I became sure
Of what I was to do

[Chorus:]
Could this be love
Cause I never ever felt this way
Could this be love
Could it be love
And if so I want this feeling to stay
Could this be love
Cause I never ever felt this way
Could this be love
Could it be love
And if so I want this feeling to stay
Could this be love

[Bridge:]
I think that you might be the one
(think that you might be the one for me)
I think that you might be the one

[Chorus:]
Could this be love
Cause I never ever felt this way
Could this be love
Could it be love
Cause if so I want this feeling to stay
Could this be love
Cause I never ever felt this way
Could this be love
Could it be love
And if so I want this feeling to stay
Could this be love

Could, Could, could this be love
Could, Could, could this be love
Could, Could, could this be love
Could, Could, could this be love
