It's tearin me apart
Everytime I realize
What we used to have is finished
And what I wouldn't give
To rewind the past
I'm tired of walkin around
With my head hanging down
Beatin myself up about it
Gotta make my mind up
Before it's too late

I can't blame you
After all the xxxx I put you through
Even gonna lie to you
I've got some issues
I must admit that I was wrong
I've got some issues
Didn't know what I had
Til it was gone
And I don't know if I deserve
For you to come back home
Cause I got issues
Girl, I got issues
Don't hold it against me

And I just can't walk away
(Just can't walk away)
Cause my life is faded (faded)
I'm trapped in 2 different worlds
Without you
I've been tracing my footsteps
But keep going in circles
And you say your done with me
Girl I can't try

I can't blame you
After all the xxxx I put you through
Not even gonna lie to you
I've got some issues
I must admit that I was wrong
I've got some issues
Didn't know what I had
Til it was gone
And I don't know if I deserve
For you to come back home
Cause I got issues
Girl, I got issues
Don't hold it against me

Inspite of my own issues
Atleast I'm man enough
To tell y'all
You can't nudge me for being honest (no)
I see you actin like you wanna leave
But don't turn your back on me

I've got some issues
I must admit that I was wrong
I've got some issues
Didn't know what I had
Til it was gone
And I don't know if I deserve
For you to come back home
Cause I got issues
Girl, I got issues

It's tearin me apart
Everytime I realize
What we used to have is finished
And what I wouldn't give
To rewind the past
