I never meant for you to leave and go far away
And I hate that I caused you so much pain
I'm hurting now
Everywhere I go, I'm facing dark clouds
Barely holding on, I'm fading out
I pushed love far away
It has traveled further than I can go

I committed suicide
Ever since she left me it feels like my life is reckless out of control

I committed suicide
I'm cursed without a conscience and I'm dying cause my guardian angel is gone
I've committed suicide

I don't know, I don't know
I've committed suic... (whoo-oh)
I don't know, I don't know
I've committed suic... (whoo-oh)
I don't know, I don't know
I've committed suic... (whoo-oh)
Committed suicide (whoo-oh)

I just jumped off a bridge and lost the better half of me
Turned my back on love
And I feel like a bird without a wing (who-ooh)

Oh I'm hurting now
Wish I could go back and slow time down
I would turn that frown into a smile
I wish I could show you how much I've changed
I'd do anything to get it back

Committed suicide
Ever since she left me it feels like my life is reckless out of control

I committed suicide
I'm cursed without a conscience and I'm dying cause my guardian angel is gone
I've committed suicide

I don't know, I don't know
I've committed suic... (whoo-oh)
I don't know, I don't know
I've committed suic... (whoo-oh)
I don't know, I don't know
I've committed suic... (whoo-oh)
Committed suicide (whoo-oh)

I regret the day she left me behind
Why did I waste our precious time
How can I betray the gift that god has given to me (oh no)

Committed suicide
