[Verse 1:]
I was runnin after women, women all the time
Hittin it and quitin it that was me
Settling down never crossed my mind
It was all about me havin two or three
And the fact that you got me got me opened up
And da homies askin what's up
Cause my conversation only be bout you
Girl I don't know what to do but

[Chorus:]
Don't stop
Baby keep it comin come on
Don't stop
Got trippin baby you got me gone
Don't stop
I need it girl don't take it away
Cause I can't start my day without the way that you play

Don't stop
You know how I like it
I be so excited
Oh oh
Baby girl I'm tellin ya
I need it on the regular
You just keep it hot keep it hot
Baby don't stop

[Verse 2:]
It's crazy how I always always think of us
When all I use to think bout was me
When from spendin all my doe up in da club
To spendin it on anything you need

[Bridge:]
Ain't never been like like this before
Can't never go back back not no more
I'm tryna fight but I can't (no no)
Cause girl I ain't got nothin left but

[Chorus:]
Don't stop
Baby keep it comin come on

[Verse 3:]

If you wait in the bed with me

Got me doin all them things that a player suppose to
(you make me change my ways)
And it don't matter what nobody go and say (oh no)
Cause the only thing I'm thinkin bout is you (thinkin bout is you)
So don't stop doin what you do (doin what you do)

[Chorus:]
Don't stop
