See my days are long
And the nights they seem to never end
Got me feeling numb
And it's hard for me to get out of bed

I'm trapped inside the memories
So hard to erase them
Try to hit the forwad botton
But I'm still on play back

How do you dare
Try to heal or even joke with
When your time was invested
And the wounds are wide open

Trusted you with my heart
I should have kept guarded
Before I played my part
That's when the problem started

Acted like it was right
It was the opposite
More I try to defy
That's why I gotta quit

Never thought I'd be so full of regret
Cause in my eyes you never make a mistake
Now to think of you just gets me upset
So sick to my stomach

I wish that I could undo rememberin'
Undo the time we spend
Undo me saying I love you I love you
Undo take it back
Undo matta fact
Wish I could stop it before it started
And undo ever knowing you
(You you you you you you) undo
(You you you you you you) u-undo
(You you you you you) u-u-undo
Wish I could stop it before it started
And undo ever knowing you

Walls are closing in
And it's hard for me to get out this space
You'd be out with him
And you come home and lie straight to my face

What you wanted you never had
I wonder what could have been
Can't tell there was nothing left
And nothing's what you've given me

Why didn't I see
That your love came with a limit
Then the truth finally comes out
That your heart was never in it

Never thought I'd be so full of regret
Cause in my eyes you never make a mistake
Now to think of you just gets me upset
So sick to my stomach

I wish that I could undo rememberin'
Undo the time we spend
Undo me saying I love you I love you
Undo take it back
Undo matta fact
Wish I could stop it before it started
And undo ever knowing you
(You you you you you you) undo
(You you you you you you) u-undo
(You you you you you) u-u-undo
Wish I could stop it before it started
And undo ever knowing you

[Talking:]
It's Like I gave you everything
And what did you really deserve in the end
And I know when we began this
I wanted to put my heart in this
And I really wish that I could just

(I wanna bring that back)

Never thought that I would be so full of regret
Cause in my eyes you never made a mistake
Now the thought of you baby just gets me upset
So sick to my stomach
Wanna stop remembering all of the time we spent
Me saying that I love you
Undo Undo Undo

Never thought I'd be so full of regret
(Cause in my eyes you would never make a mistake)
Now to think of you - now to think of you
(You you you you you you) undo
