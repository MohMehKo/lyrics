[Pre-Verse:]
I can't understand what I'm going through
It's like every morning when I wake up
I think of you
I got you on my mind all the time
You're a dime
And I got to have you right by my side so
Listen up to what I gotta say
I need you in my life
Wouldn't have it any other way
And if you don't know my name
It's time that you get acquainted
Let's go ah!

[Verse 1:]
I know you ain't looking for a man tonight
Cause everytime I'm in a relationship
Things just don't go right
Emotional rollercoaster's up & down girl that's life
You ain't alone I promise you
I swear I've been going through some things too
Sit down right here
And let me, your dear, let's talk for a minute
So I can tell you how
I love your style, perfect smile
I must admit it
You're a dime, and u got to be mine
Your life girl I wanna be in it
I don't want nobody but you...

[Chorus:]
Looking for love in all the wrong places
Staring you right in the face
Bet you... you noticed it if he touched you
Got to be in the right place
Just take a chance
I'll make it all worth it
Your life will never be the same
If you can trust me girl I will show you

[Verse 2:]
I know that you already heard every word that I'm saying
And boo...
You think I run a game
We're all the same
But I wanna show you that ain't true
We can take it slow
Let me know
Cause baby girl it's up to you now
What you wanna do now
Listen girl...
I know a place we can go
And no one has to know
Just me & you
We can do anything you wanna do
Don't say no (don't say no)
Just roll with the flow (just roll with the flow)
Cause I can't see myself without you, ooohh... yeh!
Ooohh

[Chorus:]
Looking for love in all the wrong places
Staring you right in the face
Bet you... you noticed it if he touched you
Got to be in the right place
Just take a chance
I'll make it all worth it
Your life will never be the same
If you can trust me girl I will show ya

[Rap:]
Come and walk with me...
It's alright ma
Come and talk to me
I ain't trying to rush you
Just come walk with me... eyy!
And we can do whatever you want to do
Hop in the convertible
And get yourself comfortable girl!
Just let you know I'm feeling your whole vibe
I'm feeling your whole style
And I'm trying to get inside you
Just take a ride with your boy to the sky ma
You in the club and you looking so fly ma
You with a darn-arm shining like a rock-charm
You hear the song
You know we gonna get it on... ah!
Till six in the morning
We gonna keep going
Till the kids yawning
Till the kids snoring
Here let me show you
Ride with me shorty
We rolling on the floor
This you know your boy balling
Hit the mall dawling
Give me your number
Get in the right place
And I'm gonna call you
We on yeh!
