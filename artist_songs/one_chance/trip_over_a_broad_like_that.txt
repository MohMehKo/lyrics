[Intro: talking]

[Chorus:]
You can blame a nigga for it ain't my fault she came around,
She said she wasn't with you from the go I put it down,
Me and you go back how you gon' trip over a broad like that,
You can hit the strip and get some mo' they come a dime a dozen cause a hoe gon' be a hoe,
Nigga stop lovin stop kickin these hoe's,
Me and you go back how you gon' trip over a broad like that.

[Verse 1: Courtney]:
Aye listen playa there's somethin I gotta tell ya it's about ya main chick, (go head man)
That ya been blabbin bout maybe settlin down with or claimin ya wifey, (what)
It's cool and all and I ain't tryna knock on what ya'll been buildin, what you talkin bout)
But I got value info it's so much you don't know,
It's a guarantee you lose it when you hear what's goin on.

[Talking: Jon]
Now here we go with that he say she shit,
Another nigga tellin me about my main chick,
But go head and speak your mind,
I hope this shit legit before you waist my time,
Because I done heard this shit before,
Another nigga tellin me my girl's a hoe,
But if I ain't see it with my own eyes,
I'm only gon' assume that yo ass a liar

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Mic]
Don't sweat it playa yes what I'm bringin you should appreciate, (nigga hold up)
But look on the bright side least you found out before it was too late, (this some bull shit)
You can't be serious you shoulda known better hoe can't be a housewife, (aye)
Ya might as well charge it to the game and leave it in the past,
And except it for what it is.

[Talking: Jon]
First of all I'm a grown ass man,
And I don't need anotha nigga tellin me my plans,
In life yeah that's right,
Take ya bitch ass home nigga we ain't tight,
And what you mean how I'm gonna trip,
You got a lot of nerve askin me that shit,
But I'm cool if you cool,
Cause the same thing just happened to you.
