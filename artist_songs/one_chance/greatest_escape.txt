Whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah

Have you ever been down on your luck
And you felt like you wanna give up, give up, aha
Plus you feel like the world's on your shoulders
And no one cares enough
So you close your eyes, you drift away
To the perfect place
Where your fantasies become reality
The greatest escape, yeah

I wanna go where the sun shines bright and
Everybody feels alright, yeah
If you wanna live life stress free then
Put your hands in the sky and help me say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeah

Have you ever had a perfect day and you didn't want it to end
Plus you had the time of your life and you didn't
Have to pretend
So you tried to find a way to freeze your time
Can't let it slip away, yeah
Cause you're worry free, just how you wanna be
The greatest escape

I wanna go where the sun shines bright and
Everybody feels alright, yeah
If you wanna live life stress free then
Put your hands in the sky and help me say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeah

Everybody has a dream, a dream
It's where you wanna be, be
And get everything you need, need
Just to tell and... everybody say yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah, say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I wanna go where the sun shines bright and
Everybody feels alright, yeah
If you wanna live life stress free then
Put your hands in the sky and help me say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I wanna go where the sun shines bright and
Everybody feels alright, yeah
