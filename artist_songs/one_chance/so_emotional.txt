Shuld I Have Known That This Wuld Happen Once Again Was There Something I Culd Have Done To Make Her Stay An Watch Her Turn Around An Find The Freedom To Walk Out Another Day
I'm Sick Of This Love
I'm Caught Up In My Fears
An It's Tearin Me Up

[Chorus:]
I'm So Emotional
Ever Since The Situation My Mind Is Telling Me I'm No Good
Ever Since U Been Gone
Life Just Ain't The Same Thereâs No On E Else To Blame But Love

I'm Crying Even Tho The Tear Neva Fallin 4rm My Eyes
I'm So Emotional (So Emotional)
I'm So Emotional (O0o0o0o0o0o)

[Chorus:]
