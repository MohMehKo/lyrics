Hey there
What you doing
Why you looking so down
Instead of showing your smile
That I love
On you ay
It's so good to see
How our love has proven
To stand the test of time
See you keep my mind on you
Always and I'm so lucky
I'm fortunate

You know I see the sunrise in your eyes babe
Your eyes babe
So bright
You drive my rain and clear the clouds babe
I don't ever need an umbrella, say
Noone could ever take your place
Cause you mean the world to me
Believe it when you hear me say

[Chorus:]
You're everything in me
You're all I ever need
The air that I breathe
You are
Everything
You are
The only face I see
You are
The song I love to sing
Woahhh
Yeah you're the perfect melody
Ohhh
We're in perfect harmony

I can't help
Keep looking
At your beautiful face
You never cease to amaze
Your skin
Says glowing
You're gorgeous to me
Now come
A little closer
I wanna give you a kiss
You know I love them lips
Forever
Always and
I'm so lucky
Still fortunate

You know I see the sunrise in your eyes babe
Your eyes babe
So bright
You drive my rain and clear the clouds babe
I don't ever need an umbrella, say
Noone could ever take your place
Cause you mean the world to me
Believe it when you hear me say

[Chorus]

I need you
In my life
Forever more
Baby you are
My star
I will adore you baby
Always forever

[Chorus]
