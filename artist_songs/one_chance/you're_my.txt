You can be my homie, my ace, my friend and
You can be my start, my middle, my end
You could be my pillow, my cover, my bed
Or you could be my drink that I'm sippin'
Girl it's' not enough just to have you here with me
And it's' not enough just to call you my baby
Cause you're more than a diamond ring, More, than a pretty face
I can't take it girl you're too much

It will take a lifetime to explain
You're my, you're my

When they ask me I tell em' your name
You're my, girl you're my
There ain't' no reason just to keep playin' around
Ain't no reason cause I'm good with what I found
You're everything I need, everything to me
You're my, you're my

You could be my food, my water, my pill
You could be my kinky, my sexy, my thrill
You can be my focus, my prize, my goal
You could be the one I care for when we're old
Girl it's' not enough just to have you here with me
No it's' not enough just to call you baby
Cause you're more than a diamond ring, more, than a pretty face
I can't take it girl it's' too much

It will take a lifetime to explain
You're my, you're my
When they ask me I tell em' your name
You're my, girl you're my
There ain't' no reason just to keep playing around
Ain't no reason cause I'm good with what I found
You're everything I need, everything to me to
You're my, girl you're my

And if I lost everything baby
I'd be ok cause I know that you'd stay with me
I'd go for days without eating, drinking and sleeping
Cause you got what I need baby and that's enough
I'd have to be a fool to let you go
Ooo Girl Feeling like I just won the lotto
No more looking around
Cause I finally found everything I need in you

It will take a lifetime to explain
You're my, you're my
When they ask me I tell em' your name
You're my, girl you're my
There ain't' no reason just to keep playing around
Ain't no reason cause I'm good with what I found
You're everything I need, everything to me to
You're my, girl you're my

You're My
You're My
You're My
