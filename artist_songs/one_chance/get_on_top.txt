[Plies: Talking]
Ay What's Happenin' Baby
This ya Lil Woo Plies man and One Chance
Just was sitting down with the big homies having a big boy conversation dog
They was telling me how they just had a nice Chi-town shawty on top
But I was just telling them about my story,
But the lil homies story was more impressing than mine.
Let me tell ya'll about it

[One Chance:]
Shawty what's up(Up)
Let me know(Know)
Whatever it is you need
Cause I'm gonna get this party(Party)
Started for you(You)
Make sure you catch you one(one)
Maybe even two (I'm cool)
Baby my purpose is to make you feel good(Feel good)
And put you on this lovin' straight up out the hood (Out the hood)
Baby I know you love to ride(Ride),
Let's switch it up this time(Time)
Sit back and relax and let me... (Oooh)

[Chorus:]
Get on top...
If you got one coming
Shawty I'm gon gun it
Back to back and non-stop...
I can make you feel right
I can do this all night
Just as long as I...
Get on top...
Doin' too much moving
I don't want ya to lose it
Back to back and non-stop
I can make you feel right
I can do this all night
Just as long as I

[Plies:]
Want you to lay on your back
I'm a make you feel special
With my mouth tonight
That's how I'm gon undress you
If you throw it back to me
Makes it even better
Let lick my fingers until she gets it wetter
I'll ease up off if you can't take the pressure
Let me kiss you down there
Baby dats how I bless ya
Trying to make you moan at all different levels
Want you to get on top of me
So I can look at ya
Gon pace yourself
Cause tonight it's whatever
Want this feeling to end
Want us to get stuck together
Let me get you out the bed
And sit you on the dresser
When you feel it coming
Tell me, so we can cum together
Got you where I want
Cause now I can look at ya in the mirror
Pull you closer to me now
So now I can hear you clearer
Can tell you almost there
Cause I can feel ya shiver
When you on top of me baby
That's when you the most serious

[Chorus:]
Get on top...
If you got one coming
Shawty I'm gon gun it
Back to back and non-stop...
I can make you feel right
I can do this all night
Just as long as I...
Get on top...
Doin' too much moving
I don't want ya to lose it
Back to back and non-stop
I can make you feel right
I can do this all night
Just as long as I...

That's our story
One Chance

We the future
