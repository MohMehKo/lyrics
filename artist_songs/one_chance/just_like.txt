It's been a couple months since I've seen you smiling, babe
I've been trying to figure it out, girl
Could it be because you ain't seen that much of me?
Cause I'm in and out of town, girl
Oh, OOO oh
I know this music playing is so brand new and
It's rough sometimes
It can be hard on you
But baby, I'm your soldier
Can't wait til I can hold ya
Just in case, you forgot
I'll say it once again

[Chorus:]
Just like
You're missing me
I'm missing you
And everytime
You're without me
I'm without you
The days go by
It only brings me closer to coming home
Don't wanna leave you alone, baby
Just like the perfect fit for hand and glove
And more like the best of friends, I fell in love
The days go by
It only brings me closer to you
Baby, I want you to know
I'm just like you

I know sometimes I don't call like I'm supposed to
Don't mean I don't wanna hear your voice, girl
And you say my actions don't show I'm missing you
But sometimes I don't have a choice, girl
I know you think that I'm out doing wrong
But none of these girls can gimme what I got at home
Baby, you're the reason why I'm doing what I'm doing
Don't trip, we'll make it through it

[Chorus:]
Just like
You're missing me
I'm missing you
And everytime
You're without me
I'm without you
The days go by
It only brings me closer to coming home
Don't wanna leave you alone, baby
Just like the perfect fit for hand and glove
And more like the best of friends, I fell in love
The days go by
It only brings me closer to you
Baby, I want you to know
I'm just like you

Girl, I understand how you feel
Cause I've been there before
But you gotta know
Don't act like I ain't never coming back again
Girl, trust me
I'm your man, baby

[Chorus:]
Just like
You're missing me
I'm missing you
And everytime
You're without me
I'm without you
The days go by
It only brings me closer to coming home
Don't wanna leave you alone, baby
Just like the perfect fit for hand and glove
And more like the best of friends, I fell in love
The days go by
It only brings me closer to you
Baby, I want you to know
I'm just like you

I'm just like
Just like you [x3]

Oh, somebody help me say
Oh, girl

I'm just like
Just like you [x3]

Oh, babe, yeah

[Chorus:]
Just like
You're missing me
I'm missing you
And everytime
You're without me
I'm without you
The days go by
It only brings me closer to coming home
Don't wanna leave you alone, baby
Just like the perfect fit for hand and glove
And more like the best of friends, I fell in love
The days go by
It only brings me closer to you
Baby, I want you to know
I'm just like you

Just like
I'm just like you
