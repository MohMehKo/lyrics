Girl picture this
You and me
On a G5 flight to heaven
This is where
You wanna be
Just a .. and the loving
I’m gone
And I need
The best party girl you ever seen
First class with me
Don’t be scared to go up and away with me
Up and away with me

[Chorus]
Cause I’m gonna blow you up your world baby
I’ll fly you anywhere that you wanna go
Up and away [repeat]

Now picture this
No turbulence
..
You can’t resist
These complements that I’m whispering in your ear
See you with me
It’s like snow on a mountain peak
We can be like the sun is kissing the see
Let’s go up and away
Up and away

[Chorus]

Take a trip to Mexico
Watching you spend my pesos
Where gonna make love on the sand
While whispering
I don’t say a word
Cause .. got you going crazy
And we won’t stop baby until we’ll reach the sun
.. my heart got beating like a drum
And I’m gonna introduce you to the ,, club
I’ll fly you any way any way you want to go

[Chorus]
