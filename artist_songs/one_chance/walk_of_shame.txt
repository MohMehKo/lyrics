I crawl two thousand miles, walk a million feet
Baby, I know I’m not perfect, I can admit it
That I ain’t good enough for you
And you’re too good for me

I know you’ve been hurt
So I should know what you don’t deserve
And I don’t wanna do something stupid
So I’ll go ahead and do it
And walk away on that walk of shame
On that walk of shame

Baby, I know we would never be the same again
So I’ll walk away cause maybe we were meant to be friends
Girl, I’ve never meant to hurt you
When I know I don’t deserve you
I’ll walk away on that walk of shame
On that walk of shame

Love, just to be a man
Oh no
Barefooted on desert sand
Oh dear, I don’t care the sun is hot
I’d rather do that and not get in your way
Get in your way

You’re much too special to me
No, us break up, I don’t wanna see
Even though we’ve just got started
I think I should part and go our separate way
On that walk of shame

Baby, I know we would never be the same again
So I’ll walk away cause maybe we were meant to be friends
Girl, I’ve never meant to hurt you
When I know I don’t deserve you
I’ll walk away on that walk of shame
On that walk of shame

Baby, I know we would never be the same again
So I’ll walk away cause maybe we were meant to be friends
Girl, I’ve never meant to hurt you
When I know I don’t deserve you
I’ll walk away on that walk of shame
On that walk of shame
