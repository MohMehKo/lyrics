[Verse 1: Rob]
Imagine this mhmmmmmhmmmm yay
(Imagine this)
Lights down low
Rob big show you with no panties on (imagine this)
Beast in the sheets when I reach my peak
No one can stop me in my zone
R-kells on blast bumping and grinding
I know that's your favorite song (imagine this)
But I gotta know if your down with me
Cause I don't wanna feel crazy (no)
If I give you all of me
Loving ya baby if ya really ain't in it oh my lover
@ my love twitter your love
Let's make it world wide
But please let me know if your down baby

[Chorus: Courtney]
Look me in my eyes
Tell me what your feeling
Is it me and you
I need to know if your willing
To go all the way way
I don't wanna look crazy (don't)
(Wanna look) look crazy (I) (don't)
(Wanna look) look crazy

[Verse 2: Mic]
(Imagine this)
Foldgers in ya cup
Breakfast in bed
How ya like ya sausage and eggs (imagine this)
All filled up
Let's hit the shower
[?]
Let's call ya boss
You taking off
Tell him [?]
But I gota know if your down with me
Cause I don't wanna look crazy (no)
If I give you all of me
Loving ya baby if you really ain't in it oh my love
@ my love twitt ya love let's make it world wide
But please let me know if your ready

[Chorus]

[Rap: Dough Boy]
Keep it real baby
Don't play with me
Get ya night clothes
Come stay with me
Ignore all them calls cut ya phone off
Get rid of that bra take ya thong off
Late night rondezvou we on fluid
Like brand new box of nike
Me and you just do it
12 play baby bump and grind to the music
Shawty you a cutey man I swear I'm bout to lose it
Open up and let the drive in like a movie
Got you goin dumb
Cause my sex game stupid
Uhaul booty baby girl just move it
And you only get one chance to prove it
I can't wait for that sexual contact
Bedroom war gang sexual combat
I only got one night in town
Break down or be clowned
Baby call are you down?
