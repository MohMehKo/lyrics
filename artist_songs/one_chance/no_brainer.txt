[Verse 1:]
How could you see a girl so fine and
Not push up
How could you finally win her heart and
Messed that up
How could you blow a whole time of beautiful love
For a couple of hours of tossin it up
I don't understand girl loving you seems easy
How could you not think banquet hearts engagement ring
And How could you not just go all out in Vera Wang
How could a body that be bangin be waitin up under the sheets
And you be gettin mad be fallin asleep
I don't understand it cause loving you seems easy

[Hook:]
See all the things that you need your man to do
When it comes to you is second nature
No second thoughts about what you want I gotta it
It's not up for question

[Chorus: x2]
And there ain't no second guessing bout us
It's a no brainer
Me and you
It's a no brainer
If I got you I know I got enough
It's a no brainer
Just being with you
It's a no brainer

[Verse 2:]
Why would he go out his way avoiding you
Why would he even bother taking you from dude
Why would he break the G-code tuslter and roll
To bring you home now he lettin you go
I don't understand it girl loving you is easy
How many lame excuses can he conder up
How many more before she calls you bluff
How could he slip up in fall through the booty club
And then lie bout where he was
I don't understand it girl loving you so easy

[Hook:]
See all the things that you need your man to do
When it comes to you is second nature
No second thoughts about what you want I gotta it
It's not up for question

[Chorus: x2]
And there ain't no second guessing bout us
It's a no brainer
Me and you
It's a no brainer
If I got you I know I got enough
It's a no brainer
Just being with you
It's a no brainer

[Bridge:]
Girl it's simple to me
So simple to see
A girl like you comes onces in a life time
I'm not tellin you to leave
But if it's was me
You never have to worry because I swear I will act right
I will never hurt you
And I will never let you go
Girl it's just a No Brainer

[Chorus: x2]
And there ain't no second guessing bout us
It's a no brainer
Me and you
It's a no brainer
If I got you I know I got enough
It's a no brainer
Just being with you
It's a no brainer
