Hello, yeah it's me... no no... don't hang up... listen... listen... listen...

[Verse 1:]
I convinced to let your gaurd down for me
U put your trust in me I broke it unintentionally
Now baby don't lay it on me cause I'm only human
But if u take me back maybe I can change my ways
I can guarentee you anything
I'm right here

But I can give you my word

[Chorus:]
This is my word
I'll make my way back into your heart
Babe because
That's my word... yeah

[Verse 2:]
I can't blame u if u knock my crediblity
I admit that I've done some damage wasn't thinking of you

All the times we speak we fell in love
You must have forgot
Girl I promise that I'll change overnight for you
