My hearts starts to beat a little slower
Every time shes walks out
I know it might be the last time
I ever see her face again
When she showers I wonder what shes thinking
Is her mind stuck on the fact that I don't bring her
Flower no more
Lights out Love ain't living here no more

Cause lately we ain't even speaking
And we sleeping in the same damn room
The girl would rather watch the tv
So I feel like she will be leaving me soon
And she ain't even tryin to make love
So I guess I must have really messed up
Now ever time I hear that
Uhhh I hear that
Uhhhh I'm looking at my heart slip away
Listen to my heart go
Thinkin she about to go
Listen to my heart go
[Breathing]
Flatline
Listen to my heart go
Thinkin so about to go
Listen my heart go
Flatline

Everyday She comes home a little later
All of sudden she be caring bout the things shes wear
But before she worn sweats and tied her hair up in ponytails
I'm trying not to sweat it but I can't
Help to think my baby riding shotted with another man
Time Out
I'm doing this the best way I can

But we ain't even speaking
And we sleeping in the same damn room
The girl would rather watch the tv
So I feel like she will be leaving me soon
And she ain't even tryin to make love
So I guess I must have really messed up
Now ever time I hear that
Uhhh I hear that
Uhhhh I'm looking at my heart slip away
Listen to my heart go
Thinkin she about to go
Listen to my heart go
[Breathing]
Flatline
Listen to my heart go
Thinkin so about to go
Listen my heart go
Flatline

Do you know I made another mistake
I'm sitting here thinking bout all the choices that I made
She wanna leave me but I don't wanna see her go
Shawty said she don't need me
But only inside I know

But we ain't even speaking
And we sleeping in the same damn room
The girl would rather watch the tv
So I feel like she will be leaving me soon
And she ain't even tryin to make love
So I guess I must have really messed up
Now ever time I hear that
Uhhh I hear that
Uhhhh I'm looking at my heart slip away
Listen to my heart go
Thinkin she about to go
Listen to my heart go
[Breathing]
Flatline
Listen to my heart go
Thinkin so about to go
Listen my heart go
