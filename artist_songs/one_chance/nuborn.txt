Damn
You no I did you wrong and everything but I
I just want u to know that I need you back by my side and there ain't nothing like to do now I just want u back with me you no what I'm saying
One chance

One more one more one more chance [x3]
Oh yeah

[CHORUS:]
Just give me one more chance
Girl you are my everything
One more glance, at your face
Cause you no you are my queen
Now I feel you, you no my heart will see u in my dreams just come back to me

I did my dirt to make you hurt in the past
But this time I promise I will make it last
Cause when u left girl why am I gonna support my soul
How is self esteem and on the down low
Thinking you will no, you thinking I'm faithful
Til the truth unfolds and u told me you're done and u had to go
Left me all alone, when I took the phone
Cause I did u wrong
And I'm trying to be strong, never meant to ever let you go
Cause you no you're the one that brings me up sounds like the sun and now I'm down the road and can't see no more my nights are gone

One more one more one more chance [x3]
Just give me one more chance.

[Chorus]

I'm feeling so shamed cause I was playing games
Who else is there to blame no not, you
But myself girl having you wasn't enough for me you did so much for now I couldn't see
Now let me breathe ah ah ah no oh
Never want to have another reason for you to leave
I'll do anything for you to get you, you deserve what I need
So come back to me just come back to me
Cause if I didn't have you in my life my life would end
Not only are you my lover but my friend

My my my my my my friend my my my my my my friend (no oooohhhh yeah yeah yeah) [x2]

[CHORUS:]
Just give me one more chance
Girl you are my everything
One more glance, at your face
Cause you no you are my queen
Now I feel you, you no my heart will see u in my dreams just come back to me
