Another year has come and gone
I thought I had to make it all alone
It’s been so long but God above
Gave me the strength to find someone to love

So girl I’m kind of glad 
You walked into my life
I finally found love 
Though I had to sacrifice

I’m truly glad to know you 
Baby soon you’ll want to go
Hey but now 
I’m king on a throne

Girl I’m kind of glad (so glad) 
You walked into my life (pretty little angel)
I finally found love (yes sir) 
Though I had to sacrifice

I’m truly glad to know you 
Baby soon you’ll want to go
Hey right now right now right now
I’m king on a throne

Once knew a girl who broke my heart
Ten-thousand love affairs I played the part
Come rain or shine I’ll never be 
The fool I was until your love found me

So girl I’m kind of glad 
You walked into my life
I finally found love 
Though I had to pay the price

Girl I’m truly, truly glad to know you
Maybe soon you’ll want to go
Whoa but right now I said I’m king on a throne
Give me my crown hey

Girl I’m kind of glad (well well well well well) 
You walked into my life
(Oh) I finally found love (my love) 
Though I had to pay the price

I’m truly glad, truly glad to know you
Maybe soon you’ll want to go, whoa
But right now yeah I’m king on a throne
I don’t want to be left alone

Girl I’m kind of glad (baby I’m glad, I’m glad) 
You walked into my life (yeah--)
I finally found love (I finally found someone) 
Though I had to pay the price (though I had to sacrifice)

And I’m truly glad to know you
Maybe soon you’ll want to go, oh
But right now 
I’m king on a throne, oh

Girl I’m kind of glad (yes sir) 
You walked into my life (pretty little thing, pretty little thing)
I finally found love (yeah)
Though I had to pay the price

Girl I’m truly glad to know you
Maybe soon you’ll want to go 
But little girl, little girl right now 
I’m king on a throne…
