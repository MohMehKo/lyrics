I think too many would be the loves
go slipping through my hands.
And hopes and plans go wasting like some ashes in the sand.
I wonder if I'll ever know the right from wrong.
When I'm thinking, thinking, thinking. A good thing comes along.

Are you a pipedream like all the ones before?
Just some pipedream, a wish and nothing more.
Girl a pipedream be as wonderful as you
Pinch me, am I dreaming you?

I learned from all those yesterdays the tricks my mind can play.
It might be when the morning comes I find you've gone away.
I fall in love so easily and reach such fantasies.
That I can't be, can't be, can't be, sure to fall I should believe.

Are you a pipedream like all the ones before?
Just some pipedream, a wish and nothing more.
Girl a pipedream be as wonderful as you
Pinch me, am I dreaming you?

Oh I'm hopelessly romantic, so I wouldn't be surprised,
if my dream of tonight (is) what I'm seeing in your eyes

Are you a pipedream like all the ones before?
Just some pipedream, a wish and nothing more.
Could a pipedream be as wonderful as you?

Are you a pipedream like all the ones before?
Just some pipedream, a wish and nothing more....
