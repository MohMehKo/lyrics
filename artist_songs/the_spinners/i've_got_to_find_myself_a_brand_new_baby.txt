Mmm, hmm

The love I thought would never die
Came to a sudden end
She broke my heart in two
When she said we'd just be friends

Oh, I did all I could
I tried to make a stand
(Make a stand)
But she said,Â ?Later, later
I'm gonna leave you anyway?

I've got to find
Myself a brand new baby
I've got to find
(Oh yes, I am, have)
Myself a brand new baby

(Yeah, yeah, I've got to find)
Whoa, someone to hold me tight
(Yeah, yeah, I've got to find)
Yeah, yeah, someone to treat me right, oh baby

Ooh, hoo, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Mmm, hmm
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Oh, I guess I loved that girl, Lord
A little bit too much
Oh, how I needed, needed
A sweet and gentle touch

Her ears were deaf
To my every word
(Every word)
And my cry for love
She never, never, never heard

I've got to find
(Oh yes, I am, have)
Myself a brand new baby
I've got to find
(Oh yes, I am, have)
Myself a brand new baby

(Yeah, yeah, I've got to find)
Oh, someone to kiss goodnight
(Yeah, yeah, I've got to find)
Yeah, yeah, someone to love me right, oh baby

Ooh, hoo
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, baby, baby, baby
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Oh, life's such a lonely road
When you walk alone
(You walk alone)
I need someone
To give my broken heart a home

I've got to find
Myself a brand new baby
I've got to find
(Yeah)
Myself a brand new baby

(Yeah, yeah, I've got to find)
Searchin' here and there
And I'm searchin' everywhere
(Yeah, yeah, I've got to find)
I know there's really got to be a girl
Out there somewhere for me

(Yeah, yeah, I've got to find)
Oh, I'm lookin', oh, I'm lookin'
(Yeah, yeah, I've got to find)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh
(Yeah, yeah, I've got to find)
