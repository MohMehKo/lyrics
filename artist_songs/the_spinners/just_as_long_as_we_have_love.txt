We may not have a mansion on a hill
Mink coats and diamonds by the score
But the things we have no man could ever take it
Just the two of us now who could ask for more?
We may not have a payment stashed away
No one knows what tomorrow brings
But as long as I have you there’s no mistaking
That the world is ours to do most anything

Baby just as long as we have love
Two shoulders we can lean on if we fall
Baby just as long as we have love
We’ll have it all

We may not have a change of clothes to wear
The price of love is all we pay
We can show the world where two hearts meet together
We don’t even to know the time of day
Let other people keep their wealth and fame
Fine clothes and fancy diamond rings
There’s a price to pay for treasures felt between us
We can share the world ‘cause we have everything

Baby just as long as we have love
Two shoulders we can lean on if we fall
Baby just as long as we have love we’ll have it all (we’ll have it all)
Baby just as long as we have love 
Two shoulders we can lean on if we fall
Just as long as we have love 
Two shoulders we can lean on (oh yes we can now) if we fall 
Baby just as long as we have love 
Two shoulders we can lean on (ooh we can lean) if we fall
Baby just as long as we have love
