So you think your mind’s made up
‘Cause he sold you a bill of goods
Now you think he’s everything
And to fall for his lines as you would
His standards of living his social rating 
Girl there’s nothing he can’t afford
He made you think I ain’t it 
But when it’s love I can give you more

He won’t love you he can’t love 
He’ll never love baby like I do
He won’t love you (he can’t love you) he can’t love baby
No no no no no no no no no no no (He’ll never love baby like I do)
Whoa (like I do) like I do yeah yeah
Baby (like I do) umm yeah yeah 

Diamond rings excite you 
Expensive furs warm you through and through
But all of these put together 
Can never thrill you as much as I do
Now he can make you a movie star 
He can put your name up in lights
But these things do no good 
When you need good lovin’ at night

He won’t love you he can’t love you
He’ll never love you baby like I do
He won’t love you (he can’t love you) man can’t love you baby
He’ll never love you baby like I do 
Diamond rings and all those things (like I do)
Social rating ain’t nothing baby

Well well well

I can promise you love and with help from above (he won't love you he can't love you)
I’ll make you happy girl (he'll never love you baby like I do)
Well well well well whoa
By you diamond rings give you pretty things (he won’t love you he can’t love you)
But no baby he’ll never love you he’ll never love (he’ll never love you baby like I do)
Social rating ain’t nothing if you can’t get good loving (he won’t love you he can’t love you)
Oh baby I just want to tell ya (he’ll never love you baby like I do) he can't love ya like I do
Don’t let him blow your mind (he won’t love you he can’t love you)
With his fast talking lines
When you need somebody (he’ll never love you baby like I do)
I’ll be there...
