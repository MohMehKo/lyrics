Whenever you feel your world is falling down
Love just can't be found to help you make it through
Nothing will do
Whenever you feel like turn a back on you
And all you wanna do is sit at home and cry
My ooh my
I'll be your friend and lover
Comfort you in every way (oh baby)
I'd never thought I'd ever love someone the way that I love you

Honest I do need love and you do too
Honest I do need love and you do too (ohh)
honest I do need love and you do too

Whenever you toss and turn all through the night
No your love life just ain't right
Cause it follows you (ooh girl)
Whenever a day goes by
That you don't cry
Oh why don't you just dry your eyes
I'm here to end your sorrow and wait till tomorrow baby
I'll be your friend and lover
Comfort you in every way
I'd never thought I'd ever love someone the way that I love you

Honest I do need love and you do too
Honest I do need love and you do too
Honest I do need love and you do too

Honest I do need love and you do too
Honest I do need love and you do too
Honest I do need love and you do too

Honest I do need love and you do too
Honest I do need love and you do too
Honest I do need love and you do too
