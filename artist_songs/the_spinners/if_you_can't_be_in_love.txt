(oh, baby)
Dreams are closer than the skin
you wear
Love gleaming eyes and hair
Ever close, but, oh, so far away
Just as soon as you think that
you're there
Sketches drawn right out of
fairy tales 
Jar of happiness for sale
Slumber dreams are mere reality
All the best things i think you
are to me

If you can't be in love (baby)
Then just be what you are
Dreams are not far away
If you can't be in love (baby)
Then just be what you are
Dreams are not far ...

Kiss the truth away and then
you sigh
Over love you think is just
a house of joy
How can you find your joy with
no home

If you can't be in love (baby)
Then just be what you are
Dreams are not far away
