To whom it may concern, dig it
Each time we love we learn how to be sure
Knowing is trusting, these were your famous lines
"Don't live a life of lying"

I gave you all my time, dig it and in return I find
One hopeful dream that tends to wonder
Hanging beyond the cloud
You spoke these words out loud

You made a promise to me, you'll never go
(Go)
Eo nide undri my
You made a promise to me, you'll never go
(Go)
Then you walked out, left me in doubt

What makes you think it's right
To play around in spite of what I say
You just defy me, did you trade love for fame
The shrew cannot be tamed

My love for you is strained
Your love has seemed to change
Just like the bee, roses attracts you
They lead you on your way when flowers fade away

You made a promise to me, you'll never go
(Go)
Eo nide undri my
You made a promise to me, you'll never go
(Go)
Then you walked out, left me in doubt

You made a promise to me, you'll never go
(Go)
Eo nide undri my
You made a promise to me, you'll never go
(Go)
Eo nide undri my

You made a promise to me, you'll never go
(Go)
Eo nide undri my
