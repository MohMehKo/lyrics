When I was a child, I found out
To make it in this world, there’s no doubt
You got to be
Real strong, you see

I didn’t want my papa’s handout
So mama had to make me get out
To prove, yes prove
He was wrong, he was wrong

Oh, I got to make it (Make it on my own)
I’ve got to make (Don’t want to die a man alone)
Can’t you, can’t you, can’t you see (Life’s too short to waste it)
And oh (I’ve got to make it on my own)
Yes I have (Don’t want to die a man alone)
Lord have mercy, tell ya
I’ve got to make it on my own, yeah, on my own

I worked very hard, I did try
To find a piece of life that was mine
It seemed to me
Too long to see

I didn’t want to wait a lifetime
I’ve said I have to prove I’ll do fine
It’s proof, yes proof
He was wrong, he was wrong

I’ve got (Make it on my own)
I’ve got to do it myself (Don’t want to die a man alone)
I don’t need any kind of help (Life’s too short to waste it)
Oh no, no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no (I’ve got to make it on my own)
Oh, yes sir (Don’t want to die a man alone)
It seems life is short
Just too short to make it, gotta make it on my own

(My, own, my own, my own)
Oh, have mercy on me now

(I’ve got to make it on my own) I was down and out
(Don’t want to die a man alone) He told the nation ‘bout me
(Life’s too short to waste it) How he supported me, I gotta do it, can’t you see, hey
(I’ve got to make it on my own) We got, here we come again
(Don’t want to die a man alone) I’ve got to do it myself
(Life’s too short to waste it) I’ve proved that right or wrong, I’ve got it all together
(I’ve got to make it on my own) I see my name under the lights, yeah
(Don’t want to die a man alone) It’s been so long since mama, I just gotta move it, prove it
