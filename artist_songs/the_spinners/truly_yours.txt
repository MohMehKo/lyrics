...truly yours
...that's what the letter said

As I read the words, written in your letter. the tears began to rise
I could read between the lines, though you thought it better not to use the word good-bye
And I struggled to hold my pride, finally I broke down and I cried
Your letter ended truly yours. but you're no longer truly, truly mine
And though you signed it truly yours, you're no longer truly, truly mine. I'm left behind.

Now it's painfully clear, that you've been concealing your feelings behind lies
And I feel so foolish to have ever believed you and to think I even tried
But the one thing I'll never understand, how'd you find the nerve to take a pen in your hand
And sign the letter truly yours, when you know that you were never truly mine. 
How did you sign it truly yours, when you know that were never truly mine, just merely lying

Truly yours, oh yeah, that's what the letter said; Truly yours, saddest words I ever read

Although you're gone and I'm ma left all alone and we are far apart
The shell of a man that took his scars behind you, to love you with all of his heart
But the one thing I'll never understand, how'd you find the nerve to take a pen in your hand
And sign the letter truly yours, when you know that you were never truly mine. 
How did you sign it truly yours, when you know that were never truly, truly mine.
Truly yours but you're no longer truly, truly mine  
Though you signed it truly yours, you're no longer truly, truly mine.
