If you're livin' in a bubble and you haven't got a care
Well, you're gonna be in trouble 'cause we're gonna steal your air
'Cause what you got is what we need and all we do is dirty deeds
We're the Spaceballs! Watch out, 'cause we're the Spaceballs
We're the masters of space
Hey, don't mess around with the Spaceballs.
Uh!

Going cruisin' in a spaceship, we're so good at being bad
We'll destroy your little planet if you ever get us mad
We're mothers of the galaxy
You better scatter when you see
The Spaceballs! Watch out, we're the Spaceballs
We're the masters of space
Say what? Don't mess around with the Spaceballs.
Watch out!

We're mothers of the galaxy
We're gonna take the air you breathe
Hahahahahaha!
Oh! Spaceballs!
Watch out!

We're the Spaceballs
We're the masters of space
Do-do-do-do-don't mess around with the Spaceballs.
Yo! Watch out!
We're the Spaceballs!
We're the masters of space
Hey, don't mess around with the Spaceballs.
Watch out!

We've got a bossin' little ship
So you better watch your lip
'Cause we're the Spaceballs.
Watch out!

You may think that you are bad
But believe you can be had
By the Spaceballs!
Watch out!

We're the Spaceballs!
Watch out!

We're the Spaceballs!
We're the masters of space
Don't mess around with the Spaceballs.
We're so bad and mean
We make nightmares out of dreams
We're the Spaceballs!
We're the Spaceballs.
You better watch out!
Hehehehahahahaha!
