Ever since I meet ya, seems I can't forget ya.
The thought of you keeps running through,
the back of my mind.

Everytime I'm near ya.
I get that urge to feel ya.
Just touching you and loving you, makes everything right.

(tell me how you feel baby)

I've never knew love before, then came you, then came you.
I've never knew love before, then came you, then came you. You!

Now that I have found ya. How did I live without you?
(I don't know baby)

It's plain to see, you're all I need, to satisfy me.
I'm so darn proud of you. I want to sing about ya.
(sing it, sing it, sing it baby)

You're all I know, You made love grow, by touching my hand.

I've never knew love before, then came you, then came you.
I've never knew love before, then came you, then came you.
Hey, then came you.

Oh-Oh I've never knew love before, then came you, then came you.
I've never knew love before, then came you, you. then came you.

(with your loving touch).

You know that I never knew love before, then came you, then came you.
I've never knew love before, then came you, then came you.

(I've got to hand it to you baby, you got the power of love, got the power of love baby)

I've never knew love before, then came you, then came you.
