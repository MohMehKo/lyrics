[Verse 1]
It's a blessing to have your hand to hold it
and it's so wonderful knowing that you care 
how could I make it through the day without you baby
you are the light that showed the way 
when darkness clothed around me you found me

[Chorus]
And honey your the love of my life,
baby you're my sweety my sugar and spice 
you're the love of my life
I'm living for your loving but I can't get enough [x2]

[Verse 2]
Sometimes we have a fight but then we make up 
and love is stronger than than it ever was before
just you and me against the world together baby 
you are my jewel my precious pearl 
a treasure true forever and ever

[Chorus]
And honey you're the love of my life 
baby you're my sweety my sugar and spice 
you're the love of my life 
I'm living for your loving but I can't get enough no...
I'm living for your loving but I cant get enough 

You're the love of my life [x2]
I'm living for you're loving but I can't get enough 
you're the love of my life 
baby you're my sweety my sugar and spice
You're the love of my life
I'm living for your loving but I can't get enough 
You're the love of my life 
baby your my sweety my sugar and spice 
you're the love of my life 
I'm living for you're loving but I can't get enough
