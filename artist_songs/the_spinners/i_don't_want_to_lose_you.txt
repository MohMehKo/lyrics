Who do you think you, are who do you want to be
You’re the only one that really knows
Maybe you’ll be surprised after your search is through
When you find you’ve just been chasing you
Believe me I understand the vision of your mind
But I’m so afraid that the girl you’ll find
May not need a man like me

I don’t want to lose you, I love you as you are
I don’t want to lose you, I couldn’t love you more, more
Tell me love will remain though we may change

I really think that you have little faith in me
You’re the only one I’ll ever need
If you really understood how much you mean to me
All your doubts would fade and disappear
Maybe you’ll never find the secrets of your mind
But you’ve got to try, that I realize, and I’ll help you all I can

I don’t want to lose you, I love you as you are
I don’t want to lose you, I couldn’t love you more, more
Tell me love will remain though we may change

I don’t want to lose you, I love you as you are
I don’t want to lose you, I couldn’t love you more
I don’t want to lose you, I love you as you are
I don’t want to lose you, I couldn’t love you more
I don’t want to lose you, I love you as you are
I don’t want to lose you, I couldn’t love you more
