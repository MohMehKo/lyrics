I close up the curtain
And I pull down the blinds
Took a sleeping pill
To help sleep come to my mind
Cause it's 3 a.m.
And I'm wide awake
Thinking of you again
How you said goodbye like suicide
My love life came
To an unexpected end baby

It's one two three four
I'm just counting sheep
Oh lord I wish I could sleep
It's five six seven eight
And I'm still counting sheep
Oh lord I wish I could sleep

I felt happy Friday
When I heard you say
That you'd like to be the girl
That I marry someday
Now it's 4 a.m.
And it's Tuesday night
Life is filled with gloom
I can't understand
How my lifetime plans
Could end so fast
Only just one afternoon

[Chorus:]
It's one two three four
(Oh what's wrong with me?)
I'm just counting sheep
(I'm trying to close my eyes)
Oh lord I wish I could sleep
(But I just can't sleep)
It's five six seven eight
(it was Friday baby)
(And love was so sweet)
And I'm just counting sheep
(Now it's Tuesday night)
Oh lord I wish I could sleep
(Oh lord and I just can't sleep)

Oh lord I wanna sleep
To escape from reality
Cause in my dreams
I can make believe
That you're still hear with me
Oh baby!
The way it use to be!

[Chorus]
