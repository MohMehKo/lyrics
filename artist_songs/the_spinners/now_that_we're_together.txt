Where are the smiles, the laughter and fun?
Something is bugging almost every one
The pressure and fear can turn very clear
There must be some way to escape

This mean ol' world can get on your nerves
So many headaches that you don't deserve
So if you don't mind, I'd like to prescribe
An old remedy for you, for you and me

Now that we're together
We're gonna sing and try to make it better
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, now that we're together
Forget your cares and think about it later

Singing a song is good for the heart
Once you get started, it's quite hard to stop
You're such a great crowd, why don't you sing loud?
Oh, sing out for me, for you, for you and Me

Now that we're together
We're gonna sing and try to make it better
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, now that we're together
Forget your cares and think about it later

Now that we're together, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Now that we're together, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Now that we're together, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Now that we're here

Now that we're together, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Now that we're together, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Now that we're together, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Now that we're here, now that we're here
