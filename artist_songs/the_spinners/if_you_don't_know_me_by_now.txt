[Chorus]
If you don't know me by now,
You will never, never, never know me. Ohhhh.

All the things,
that we've been through,
You should understand me, 
Like I understand you.

Now baby, I know the difference, 
between right and wrong.
I ain't going to do nothing,
to upset our happy home.

Ahhhh
Don't get so excited,
When I come home a little late at night.
Because we only act like children, 
When we argue, fuss, and fight. 

[Chorus 2x]

We all got our own funny moods,
I've got mine.  
Woman you've got yours too.

Just trust me,
Like I trust in you.

As long as we've been together,
that should be so easy to do.
Just get yourself together,
Or we might as well say good-bye.
What good is a love affair,
If we can't see eye to eye?

[Chorus repeat to fade]
