Just say that I'm the one who
You will live and breathe for
And tiny buds will bloom, then
We would grow to love those

Sometimes our troubled world will
Come tumbling down
I still have you
We're going through

When all the winds have blown
You’ll  never feel a thing 'cause
Love has no special way of
Making bells to ring, so

Let's just move on to love and
We'll make up our minds
We're going through
There's me and you

Smile, we have each other
Sometimes I don't know where you go
But love has made us one
Come on smile, we have each other
If you're for me, we'll never be alone

Although no wealth is ours
We never feel so bad 'cause
We only miss the things that
Gave us what we have, so
If there is anything I can do for you
The way is made, the price is paid

Smile, we have each other
Sometimes I don't know where you go
But love has made us one
Come on smile, we have each other
If you're for me, we'll never be alone
Come on smile we’ll have each other
Sometimes I don’t know where you go
But love has made us one
Come on smile we’ll have each other
If you’re for me in love will be 
‘Cause love has made us one
Come on smile we’ll have each other
Sometimes I don’t know where you go
But love has made us one
Come on smile we’ll have each other
If you’re for me in love we’ll be
‘Cause love has made us one
Come on smile we’ll have each other
Smile we have each other

Smile.
