Before you say a word
Before you turn away,
There's just one thing I gotta know, 
are you still who you claim to be?

I've been told were all the same
Only difference is in the people that you wear

Growing up I thought Id never change
No apologies, always stayed the same
Now I don't look back

Ideals
And Blind devotion
Kiss loyalties goodbye
And Its growing what's inside that counts
Twisted, true and without a doubt

I've been told were all the same
Waiting for something that already came
Mind of confusion with no one to blame just waiting

Behind, locked inside your emotions
Caging, Releasing, It feeds your motives
Growing, Changing, is something you don't know, 
Makes you feel you're losing ground

Growing up I thought Id never change
No apologies, always stayed the same
I'll never look back.
