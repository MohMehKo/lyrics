I want your misery
I want you to be what I hate in me
I make you twist your mind
so you can be just like me
you got a lot that you try to hide
you need a hand
to reach deep inside of you
I don't think I like you now
but I will when you're someone else
Metamorphosize wanna make you ride inside my eyes
I wanna make you play those games with me
this perversion waits inside for you
tortured visions of yourself here on display
gotta moment and I'll tell a lie
gotta secret that can't deny
I don't want somebody else
wanna make you destroy yourself
then I want you to take it out on me
I don't care about the things that make us different
I'm gonna make you change
and you'll see yet
that I can do all this cuz I got no self esteem
I'm not gonna tell you lies
I'm unhealthy and dysfunctional
it's no surprise that I can't wait to make you
just like me
