Look at me and say to me
without guilt or compromise
that you care about anything
that doesn't jump right in front of your eyes
We got a problem you got a problem
the mesmerizing truth
We all want the life
no one is supposed to really own

Tell me what is worth dying for?
I ask with the assumption I'll get no reply

Breathe in breathe out
sometimes I get lost within a stare
I look around and I ask myself
"Why the fuck should I even care?"
this affliction repetition
it's all been done before
while I'm sittin' here just killin' time
as the world goes along for more

Tell me what is worth dying for?
Would you give up everything to make one lasting point?

We all believe we have the right
to make believe we know what's right
but how much will it take
to make you stand and be heard?

I am the reason you are the reason
to abandon everything we have become
my eyes are wide open my heart is wide open
is your mind wide open to see?
