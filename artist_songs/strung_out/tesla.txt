All alone on this battleground
Like dying roses in the face of our decay
I'll be the one voice that opposes
I'll raise my head so you can see my eyes
And know that you were not alone
When the  storm took up these skies
And how do I explain it all
As it passes here before my eyes
With gravity on my back
And you turn and whisper

We found a way to forget ourselves and just walk away
We found a way to leave it all behind
Promise me if I become the worst of anything I've done 
You'll show me the road home again 
Underground pressed against your cold dead skin

Disappearing time
And the space you build inside my mind to
Fortify a place where you can hide away 
So speak the line
And I'll give you an ear to bend
Fake a sigh of relief and we can all pretend 
That our decay defines who we are
And there's nothing left in this world but our desire
And the arms of the ones who we betray

We found a way to forget ourselves and just walk away
We found a place where we won't ever be found
Promise me if I become the worst of anything I've done 
You won't let 'em know how close we all came
To getting what we're dying for

The light on your face
Illuminates what once was a cage
For all the ghosts behind your eyes
We live forever as the wind
Our voices are the weight of time
Like a whisper in a bottle let it turn to poison wine

We found a way to lose ourselves and just walk away
We found a way to leave this love behind
We found a way to forget ourselves and just walk away
We found a way to leave it all behind
How do I explain it all
As it passes here before my eyes
Promise me I won't become everything we're running from
We're exactly where we wanna be
In the arms of the ones that we betray
