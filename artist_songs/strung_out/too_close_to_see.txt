A cup of two-day-old coffee
You're feeling like yourself again
You're still on your own; you've survived another night
In this dingy room with these same four walls

Looking in the mirror is getting easier these days
That old friend anger is losing its hold on you
The key to survival in this crazy world
And it's good to see you're still standing strong

Not too long ago, you were tearing at a world
That would never let you in
Strung out, outcast, turned away
You kept your face to the ground and fought the world with your silence

And so the seasons change and the people change
And the good times come and the good times go
You've found yourself in a winless race
Fighting for a cause you never believed

It's easy to regret, not so easy to forget
All the stupid things that used to hold you down
You gotta break that chain and move on
'Cause I know I've seen it in your eyes before

To surrender now, to throw it all away
Is to sacrifice but you can't repay
In a world that don't owe you shit
You gotta think for yourself and fight for every bit

Of that piece of mind that keeps you going on
Gets you out of bed and out that door
Step back, take a look around
And soon you'll find there's something more

That'll come your way with a little patience
It'll all work out for you in the end
This is my song to a friend
That never needed anyone until now

Sometimes you get too close to see
The different side of what life could be

And if you stare too long, it all becomes a blur
And it's easy to forget just who we are
Don't stare too hard; take a look around
