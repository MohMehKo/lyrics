We're alive in the modern world so far out of reach
Desperate souls in this electric sea
Well city lights won't guide my way and I'm running out of time
There's wreckage all around me in every passing car and freeway sign
It's a tale about the end of the world,
Encrypted in the heart of us all
We are the dark we are the light
We are the voice you hear at night
We are the architects of void
Inmates here are running the asylum all the time
The kingdom has been poisoned but nobody here can see the signs
I don't wanna hear I don't wanna say
I don't wanna know I don't wanna pray
I don't wanna be the one to let you down, let you down
I don't wanna be the one to take it all away
We are the dark we are the light
We are the voice you hear at night
We are the architects of void
We write the wrongs we build the bombs,
We put the heavens in the sky
We are the keepers of the unknown
Don't wanna hear, don't wanna say,
Don't wanna know, don't wanna pray,
Don't wanna let you down
Here where we hide
From City Lights!
