Where have you gone and run to, where have you been
I've been doing some hard thinking and I've been growing thin
Well I've slept in storms and alleyways and broken princess hearts
Assassinated kings on Christmas day, I watch the world fall apart

Well I betrayed the world I sang
The freedom to the ones I left behind
And I ain't never going back
Empire, don't cry for me anymore

Now who have you gone and become, who are you now
Cause the home you left so easily is a memory now
I'm a stranger you have always known and never will forget
I'm the trigger on your trigger finger
I'm the only ride you got

I drank the wine, I parted seas and walked the mile
I betrayed you all with the promise I'd come back
Empire, don't talk to me anymore
When dust and ash will be all you are
You will know I was never really left for you

You hold me in your heart
As you raise hell in my name
Dissect me, tear me apart
For all you know are names
All you know is pain
All you know is what you've lost

Empire, don't cry for me anymore
When dust and ash will be all you are
You can let go

One thousand armies, one grain of sand
One whispered prayer, one burning hand
In black heart fields of gold
One people's shattered history
One people's blind faith in me

The king that would never
Could never, ever
Show them all, be salvation
