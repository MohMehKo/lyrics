Curfew tonight in Hollywood
As the insurgents drawing near
Helicopters and ecstasy
And the shot heard round the world
The camera shines for channel zero
As the cool kids running scared
The army has got a brand new toy
And they're just waiting for the word

Tonight it begins so lock your doors up tight
Blackhawks over Los Angeles

The civil strife between the left and right
As the occupation falls
The homeless have taken Beverly Hills
And there's smoke from city hall

We never have seen it coming down this way before
Blackhawks over Los Angeles

And on and on they drone
In the spotlight glare, this is crazy
All broken glass and panic attacks
Silicone and pillbox hat
There's panic in the streets tonight

Curfew tonight in Hollywood and all the sirens drawing near
Gonna call down an air strike as the shock reins clear
There's panic in the streets there's a calling on the wire
And the cameras got it all as we walk on through the fire
As a crowd begins to gather...a shot rings out

We never have seen it coming down this way before
Don't really know where else to hide

And on and on they drone
In the spotlight glare, this is crazy
All broken glass and panic attacks
Silicone and pillbox hat
There's panic in the streets tonight
