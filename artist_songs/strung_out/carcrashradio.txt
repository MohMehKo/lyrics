Little black rose, don't blow away.
Yeah, slide right over, let me hear you say,
"I got the heart! I got the bombs!
A full tank of gas and nowhere to be with you.

With you.

Step into my ride
And I'll let you drive all over me."

Crash right into me and take me down.
I'm not going anywhere, please come and scrape me off the ground.

Dig, dig, dig, dig a little deeper,
I'll tell you anything you wanna know.
Show me what it's like to pull you closer.
Show me what it's like to burn this place...

To the end of the last broken bottle,
The end of the night all alone,
All alone with you.

Crash right into me and take me down.
Show me how you dance alone when there's no one else around.
Show me a secret, tell me something no one else would know
As we lose our minds and we're getting high to radio.

Silence,
We're all alone.

Like a heartbreak all the time; for the glory, for the wine.
Scratch the meaning in my arm.
Little promise, say my name, we could never be the same.
Little black rose, don't blow away.

Crash right into me and take me down.
Show me how you dance alone when there's no one else around.
Show me a secret, tell me something no one else would know
As we lose our minds and we're getting high to radio.
