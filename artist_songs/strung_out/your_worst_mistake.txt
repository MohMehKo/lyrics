Shotgun kiss from me to you and nothing more
its strange to hear you sound like you don't need me anymore
but hearts and thoughts in the cradle fall apart and melt away
no time for a reaction just the honesty...to say
once again I've done my job of pushing you away
its the rise and fall of the beginning and the end of another day
the traps I set the risk I bet the one that got away I sit,
down to wonder why
the weight of the world
is all I ever have to give
so write me off
as just another mistake 
that you once made
digging to get nowhere, I surround myself with good luck charms
useless and intangible, I keep it moving straight ahead
assess the situation, make a decision, execute and crawl
Aching to move on
the weight of the world
is all I ever seem to give
so write me off
as just another mistake
