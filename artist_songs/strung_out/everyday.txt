I'm preaching life 
I'm preaching thought 
cause I see it all around me 
as it struggles to unfold on a world 
born afraid

I don't need science, no reason 
to calculate what's here inside 
no answers won, no questions asked 
will chase this feeling away 

I know about hate 
I've been in love 
and I've seen everyone around me 
close their eyes and turn to stone
I've seen hope in disguise

Well I'm not trying to save your soul 
don't wanna show direction 
don't wanna take control 
I've been a lie 
I've told a lie but I'm trying to get it better each day I try

Life shot in the vein 
pumped in the heart 
awaking my soul 
knocked down 
kicked in the face 
shown the easy path is the hardest way down 

I've drawn to one conclusion 
that no one really understands anything 
we're all grinding gears 
don't know which way is up
once the soul is dead the mind ain't far away 

Arhhhh!? Everybody Shutup!

On the steps of my mind one thousand thoughts decline away
