Now I already know which way the wind blows
By the sound of machine hearts blotting the horizon
And I no longer feel the weight of consequence
My actions prove futile
My deliverance a waste of wine
I feel like I've been hypnotized a lifetime waiting to awake
And offer something more
One screen showed me to the sea
The other flashed the drums of war
And everybody sang

I no longer wanna see what you're showing me
It doesn't mean a thing at all
It doesn't change the way I feel
It's all white noise expensive toys
Gimme mine or I'm taking yours
It's you and I along the great divide

We're never gonna see eye to eye
When the distance is measured in a lie
I already know without light there is no shadows
I'd leave it all behind
I'd walk into the setting sun
Just to burn away
The illusion that I'm living free

One screen showed the worst of me
The other tried to sell me more
Now I got all I can take
We've been to hell and back
We've seen the great divide and wanted more
Now it's coming around again

I no longer wanna see what you're showing me
It doesn't mean a thing at all
It doesn't change the way I feel
It's all white noise expensive toys
Gimme mine or I'm taking yours

And if you saw me now
Would you recognize yourself
We're all going somewhere
We're all going to Nowheresville

It's all white noise expensive toys
Gimme mine or I'm taking yours
I no longer wanna see what you're showing me
It doesn't mean a thing at all
It doesn't bother me at all
I no longer want to feel what you're too afraid to reveal
And all the signs that guide my way
Left me stranded on my way to Nowheresville
Stranded on my way to Nowheresville
It's all white noise expensive toys
Gimme mine or I'm taking yours
Stranded on my way to Nowheresville
