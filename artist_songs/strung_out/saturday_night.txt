Brand new ways of suicide too brilliant to perceive
Of broken speakers and satellites
They dance inside, they dance inside
Set the world ablaze with the gasoline from your pretty car
You buried all your lovers now
You're gonna bury me, you're gonna bury me

Dreams and reality collide within our head
Hot enough, this never walks, the blood beneath the rest
Burn away, the chemicals on flesh
A Saturday night apocalypse tsunamial eclipse

Through the mazes of your heart,
Through every single thing you crush
I can feel the leaves I trail of destruction and unrest,
Rippling the atmosphere of everything, of everything

Dreams and reality collide within our head
Hot enough, this never walks, the blood beneath the rest
Burn away, the chemicals on flesh
A Saturday night apocalypse tsunamial eclipse

Roses withered, nothing lives here anymore
Caskets and razors, nothing lives here anymore
There's nothin' but ghosts, behind your eyes

Dreams and reality collide within our head
Hot enough, this never walks, the blood beneath the rest
Burn away, the chemicals on flesh
A Saturday night apocalypse tsunamial eclipse

A saturday night apocalypse
Tsunamial eclipse
