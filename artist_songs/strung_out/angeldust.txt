Broken angel you sway helpless through the desert wind
As your enemies they come to pick your bones 
You're an anomaly so graced to be a lie you told in leisurely 
A passing fascination with obituary eyes 
So long to go 
Before these alabaster hands ever let go 
Meticulous in ritual you made a science of your pain 
Where all your bleeding hearts and hungry minds divide along the way 
So in love with all you could not be forever doomed to wonder aimlessly 
Never really knowing all the pain you're gonna find 
So long to go 
Before these alabaster hands ever let go 
Swayin' in the California haze
In angel dust we all do blow away 

We bleed this love alive 
Straight faced to suicide 
When all these words mean anything? 
What good will come of you and me? 
Just growin' old and none the wiser 
Fall apart and then your time to fall again get up again and on and on 

Wasted breath in blackened lung and shortness of belief 
Exercise your demons when you dream 
The secrets that you keep inside are all you've ever known 
Pay to ride and fuck to die reinvent another you 
But that never stops that march right off the cliff in a single file 
These angel wings will never take the weight of the fall 
A question lost in time a tasteless joke a secret smile 
To fall apart an' get up again and on again and on again

We bleed this love alive 
Straight faced to suicide 
When all these words mean anything? 
What good will come of you and me? 
Just growin' old and none the wiser 
Fall apart and then your time to fall again get up again and on and on
