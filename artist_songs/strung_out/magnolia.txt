In cruise control to the wreck of me
I lay my head up against the wheel and dream
Highway forty five O nine
Stretches across this wicked dream of mine
Abated only by the engine drone
The silence takes hold then I'm home

Phantoms and shadows take control of the wheel
The smell of gasoline sex and steel
Somewhere I lost my way and you got brave
And now here I lay

Somewhere in this highways moan
The Angels dare to guide my way
Strychnine and broken spine
The engine wanes
Seat belt tightens across my chest
Broken glass and plastic finally come to rest
And all my senses come alive and start to shake me
Broken bones and the smile that you left

Magnolia don't pray for me
All the warning signs I never cared to see
Magnolia all direction lost
I took the ride and I paid the cost

No illustrious collaboration somewhere outta time alone
You're the one that made it out
You're the shadow and the doubt
A lonely ambulance is heard across the highway
With sirens screaming out your name

Magnolia don't pray for me
All the warning signs I never cared to see
Magnolia all direction lost
You're the one that's moving
Razor steel collapse and burn away 
Crosses line and Angels prey
Cruise control to the very wreck of me
The warning signs I was too blind to see
Magnolia all direction lost
You're the one that's moving on
