Imagine a place where freedoms just a word on the wall
surrounded by the wreckage of towers that could never fall
the company will avenge 

imagine the lies like bombs turn the shock and the awe
for justice in time and a land for justice never was one thief
to rule them all along the Potomac and west toward the sea 
through the ghettos past the monuments we all built to house the weak
it's the blueprint to the fall of our place in history
the end to what we all believed to be the hope to save this place 

and I walk among the flagstones through the graves 
an apocalypse is blooming in the sage 

dead presidents lined coffin text in biblical unrest 
the blind pride home genocide and the secret wars we all missed
it's the blueprint to the fall of the entire human race 
the end to what we all believed would be the hope to save this place

and I walk among the flagstones through the graves
