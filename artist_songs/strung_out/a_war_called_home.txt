We are the last remains
We are bridge over troubled water
We are the renegades
We are awake to what's going on

I was the son of a promised land
Whose father's youth was lost in Vietnam
One nation believed all the TV said
Killed Kennedy and screamed "God is dead!"

Come sing along with me our song it can't be wrong
We are the last remains that carry on

We are the bombs that rain
Upon the ones that have done no wrong
We are the oil fields
That'll burn till all hope is gone

So raise a flag and prey on everything gone wrong
In CEO we trust to carry on

We are the breakdown, come on and get down
Forever young, gonna tear this shit down
To write a story, our own story
To be the ones that'll change direction
Cause I've been asleep too long
And I can't remember how I got so numb
To what's going on

We need no hand grenades
No machine guns to make us strong
We are the every day
They got armies well we got ours

So sing along with me we are the beating heart
That pumps this blood through veins that carry me on

So put your flag down, come on and get down
We are the ones that'll tear this shit down
To write our story, our history
Without bombs or religious glory
Cause we've been asleep too long
With no real answer how it got this far

Tonight I will not close my eyes
How can we ever sleep again
How can we ever sleep the same
How can we ever sleep the same
