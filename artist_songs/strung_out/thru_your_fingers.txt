My happiness crawling in the bottom of this pool 
just another day throw your prayers away
your not alone thru your fingers your life just slips away 
I fight my personal war 
in the end there is no score my life just slipped away 
another ounce of heaven a waste box of twisted love trembling hands 
lift me to a world far above taking on a whole new shape 
my whole world drifts away now I feel the orders and I must obey 
drunken ass all day to a bar the more things change 
the more things stay the same this drug is just another game I play 
with my soul to lose all control 
and wait for death to take me away
