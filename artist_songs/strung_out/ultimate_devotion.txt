One o one point one Fahrenheit
To some it's a fever, to her it's just right
And I can't hold her, and it's bringin' me down
Her blood runs hot but her heart beats cold
she's a devil with an angel's face I've been told
I think I'll push my luck next time you're around

Well I'd walk through fire for you
I'd burn in hell to make it all true
But I never loved anyone else in this world but you
A thousand reasons why I try to prove to you
I'm not the other guy
I don't give a damn what other people think

A flare for the strange and a temper like a whip
A soft hand clutches a riding crop grip
Smell of latex rubber it drives me insane
Beat him once then send him on his way
There's no room in your life for anyone to stay
Engrave your moniker in welts of pain

There's nothing I wouldn't do to prove
To make these words I promised true
I'd rather live my life alone than without you
You know I'd rather die then to fuck this up
Wouldn't get another try
Got one chance there's nothing I wouldn't do

You be my master, I'll be your servant
On my knees I beg to be abused
You can take the skin right off my back
With a riding crop or a leather strap
I'd take it all just to be with you

Well I'd walk through fire for you
I'd burn in hell to make it all true
But I never loved anyone else in this world but you
You know I'd rather die then to fuck this up
Wouldn't get another try
You're my goddess and I worship you.
