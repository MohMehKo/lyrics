I stand upon your sunrise
I set upon the early skies
Sent em off the edge
As you said goodbye

Hookers like you come and go
That's what I try and tell myself
That you walked out of my life
Thought that forever
You (pawned all we saved[?])

(Look out[?]) forever is today, yeah

When the (dry mark on your face)
(It got green in your eyes)
You walked to the lie
(Better off to have one better)
You (pawned all we saved[?])
(Look out[?]) forever is today, yeah

Tempers, I'm all alone
I pick yourself up off
What you used to say yeah
You think we're never (that something)
The shadow on this wall no
Now I'm running out of places to hide

Strung out, left in the rain
When shit came down I was always alright
Now you're gone I guess forever

Forever is today
Today
Today
Today

Some things that I might get control
So am I disturbing you
As I try to raise a [?] to my reality

Today
Today
Forever is today
Today
Today
Today, yeah
Today
Today, yeah
Today

Forever is today my friend
(Forever my friend[?])
