Underneath the moon in a place far away 
I know a place where we can run away. 
If you believe in me and you let me lead the way. 
I take your pain, I'll wish it all away. so far away. 
I'll take you by the hand, tell you never to fear 
In a world where we can be one so far away from here 
We'll kiss the sky together among the stars 
We will play they'll never ever find us in our castle, 
So far away well I just can't seem to forget the places 
That I've been why don't you help me 
Understand the things I really fear when the words, 
They never come out right 
And the things you say never mean a thing thing, 
When you look me straight in the eye and say everything's alright.
