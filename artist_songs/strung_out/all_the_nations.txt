In London, in Brooklyn 
By the side of the road in the rain
This airport, this ghost town
Another set of eyes breaks me down again
I know there's something going on with my perception
I see the same face in every new direction
And every set of eyes tells me something
I know about myself but never seemed to wonder

This place my heart has never seen a wound that I don't know
And all the nations tell me is we're all the same way

In Berlin, in D.C.
Going south on a cocaine train
A churchyard, your backyard
Keeping on 'til we find our way home again

To all of the nations and two light towns
In the airports and gutters the eyes shout all the same

This place my heart has never seen a wound that I don't know
And all the nations tell me is we're all the same way

Together we've been through it all and
We've seen it all and we ain't going nowhere
In life we can never try to break us down and
Get along

Together we sing along
In life we'll never be alone
In life we'll never be alone
And celebrate the space that keeps us from ever getting it
From ever getting it

This place my heart has never seen a wound that I don't know
And all the nations tell me is we're all the same way

Together we've been through it all and
We've seen it all and we ain't going nowhere
In life we can never try to break us down and
Get along
