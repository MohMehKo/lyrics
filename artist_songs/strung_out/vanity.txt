Did you leave a light on for me, did you pray I'd find my way?
Did you call out to me from the dark, did you really think I'd stay?
Did you feel me when the hurt rolled in, did you roll your pretty eyes?
Did that feeling rise up from within, did it take you by.. take you by surprise?

You know you're better off without me.
Eyes like yours could always give you away.
There were times when I needed you to be on my side.
Through these eyes that world just died, and a new one's born.

Well you murder me with pink and blue, a possession in a box for you.
Valentines and hand grenades, secret words and serenades
Symbionic mass destruction, we're directionless in vain.
Can you feel it when it comes around?
Can you feel it when it takes you by surprise?

You know you're better off without me.
Eyes like yours could always give you away.
There were times when I needed you to be on my side.
Through these eyes now I sit and watch the end of the world.

At the bottom of the ocean I sit and wait alone 
for the chance to breathe the life into my lungs.
Now I.. feel like.. myself again. 
As I beat myself against you one more, one more time.
Surprise.

You know you're better off without me.
Eyes like yours could always give you away.
There were times when I needed you to be on my side.
Through these eyes now I sit and watch the end of the world.
The end of the world.
The end of the world.
The end of the world.
