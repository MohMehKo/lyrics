Happiness finally comes to an end 
Suspicion and convictions rule my mind 
Waiting for assault or a threat 
Of another kind 
Run so far and I felt so much pain 
Hoping for [?] I tried to regain 
You always knew how to bring me to my knees 
[?] like a bad, bad disease 
I tremble and shake from the memories of your lies 
The whole worlds falling I can see it in your eyes in your eyes
So sorry it had to end this way 
Maybe I'll see you again on another day 
You told me that you loved me and I cloud not respond [?]
I follow my mind to lead you away 
Cause I fall and my heart lead me astray 
The time has come for me to say goodbye 
Grow a little older and begin to die 
[Chorus]
Yesterdays a memory a memory of pain 
I must forget what you, you meant to me
