I lie awake again no sleep tonight
I find no peace in the quiet absence of the light
A million whispered thoughts floatin' through my head
A million seconds has passed me by in my bed

One two three now it's four in the mornin' 
As the emptiness swallows me on more time
I grow a little older with every second that passes
I die a little every time I close my eyes

No sanctuary in my dreams
No quiet place to hide
Every night I swear it's the same
And I don't know where I'll be tonight
But I know sleep will come if I walk all night

It's been a thousand hours maybe even more
Since I fell victim to all the thoughts I tried to ignore
Nameless faces and sounds, voices screamin' in pain, 
Huddled shadows and sirens voices calling my name.

Well I can't sleep but I'm not awake 
To this hazy dim version of reality
Hypnotized by everything I can't control
Desensitized by everything that controls me

No sanctuary in my dreams
No quiet place to hide
Well I can't sleep so it's here in the dark
I'll make my peace with all that I've learned
Sanity's just another dream away
Maybe with time it'll be alright

Every night I swear it's the same
I walk all night and never ever get anywhere
It's taken all my strength
It's taken all the life 
That used to flow deep inside of me

All my dreams are filled with no peace
All of my days are filled with no rest
Maybe with time it'll be alright
