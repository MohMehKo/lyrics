Well I don't want to make you angry
Don't want to talk about it
when you call and I pretend I'm not around
And I don't make good company
And one of us has got to leave
cause this is getting boring by now

Now I don't know
what I'm supposed to say
when I really want to do is try to run away
Gotta get away
from this showdown I know I'll never win with you

I don't want to feed the fire
And I don't to be the liar
but something's gotta give before I'm gone
Now I'm wrong if I don't say enough
And I'm wrong if I give in too much
So I'll take a bow and get out while I can

Now I don't know
what I'm supposed to say
when I really want to do is try to run away
Gotta get away
from this showdown I know I'll never win with you

Now here I go again
just like before I'm going down
I try to practice what I wanna say
but you won't listen anyway
Like every time before
one of us is out that door
Don't bother waiting for me
cause I'll be on my way
thinking of you
