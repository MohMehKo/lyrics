I never had a reason to believe in anything
I never had a cause that I could fight for
I never had too much of anything to call my own
A drunk mother and father of four

All my life, I grew up watching others' dreams come true
And how I waited for my days in the sun
Every day, I worked harder and I got farther in debt
I realized that day wasn't ever gonna come

Written off, lost cause
Sold us down the river, got no hope to offer us
Tore down without grief
What's a generation without a reason to believe?

They tore down all my walls and then they made my hatred a crime
Debilitating us with their complacency
Our thoughts become mundane; our generation thinks the same
Our minds anesthetized by apathetic TV

No wars to fight, steel bridges won't burn
The beliefs we uphold are lies; we never learn
The only hope for the future leaves us reason to grieve
What's a generation without a reason to believe?

A reason to believe

No wars to fight, steel bridges won't burn
The beliefs we uphold are lies; we never learn
The only hope for the future leaves us reason to grieve
What's a generation without a reason to believe?
