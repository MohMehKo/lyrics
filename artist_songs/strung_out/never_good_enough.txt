She's a big girl and she knows just what she wants
She's gonna get her shit together and get out of Hollywood
Daddy's little angel won't be coming home tonight.
When you're nowhere to be found I'll know you've giving up the fight.

She can't hold her own, she says she's gotta run away from here
The city's gotten the best of her just one too many times.
When everything's been said and done and the dust has finally cleared
I'll be your fool just one more time I'll be waiting by the phone.

[Chorus:]
Cause I don't know
And I don't care
I'll do anything you want
Never good enough for you.

Well she don't need nobody anyway.
That's cause no one understands her, she's somewhere in outer space
Knock knocking at my head again, this time you won't get in
She's in orbit now and I'm underground just waiting by the phone

[Chorus]

Everything she wants 
is everything she sees
There's a riddle in her eyes 
sometimes I try to figure it out.

She's got a mountain of toys 
reaching to the sky
doesn't keep her high
Well the needle and the spoon 
the bottle and the pills 
ain't gonna make you feel alright

[Chorus]
