Grey sky man is talking to the sidewalk once again 
your perfect vision of the world it goes unheard 
as the rain falls down on your head 
it slips inside the cracks of another fruitless day 
here in the land of King Alvarez 

you're losing once again it's getting harder to survive 
when the world that's all around you just don't seem to care 
and the universe you've built for yourself is caving in right on you 
and the streets are getting colder then they used to be these days and now 

I see you walkin' down the boulevard alone 
and your screaming at the top of your lungs all night 
and I wonder to myself how did you get to be this king without a throne 
its just another sunny day here in the land of Babylon 

to see the things that no one sees 
to hear the lies that no one tells 
its getting lonely in this place 
getting tired of it all 

I've wondered to myself how many times he's cracked inside 
Screaming at the top of your lungs and now 
The voices in your head keep getting louder 
With the passing of each day 

It's getting harder to go on 
I don't know what you don't know 
You wouldn't play that game the same 
You wouldn't play that game at all 

as the rain falls down on your head it slips 
inside the cracks of another fruitless day here in the land of Alvarez
