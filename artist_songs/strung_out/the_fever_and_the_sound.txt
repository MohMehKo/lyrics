This portrait of reality, the fever and the sound.
Our place in this gravity is nowhere 'til we hit the ground.
Electrical and alkaline, rhetorical and less divine.
Impulses activate, receptors drawn to stimulate.

As the girls walk by then fade away.
As an old man dies a little everyday.
The lonely poor and arrogant all make their graves.

So stand up brave and kiss goodbye any chance we'll live forever.
My sweet black Maria surrender.
Never let this place go without a fight.
Before we all go down forever.
Hold on tight now dance with me.

The stories of these empires, they echo through these halls.
And the shadows that used to play along these lonely streets won't save you now.

As the girls walk by then fade away.
As an old man dies a little everyday.
The lonely poor and arrogant all make their graves.

So stand up brave and kiss goodbye any chance we'll live forever.
My sweet black Maria surrender.
Never let this place go without a fight.
Before we all go down forever.
Hold on tight now dance with me.

Charlatans and the kings of men and the songs that we sing.
Holy watchtowers and skin machines, vacant minds and lucid dreams.
Collisions of a life in story, make believe and allegory.
So dance with me just one more time.
Dance with me and don't look down.

So stand up brave and kiss goodbye any chance we'll live forever.
My sweet black Maria surrender.
Never let this place go without a fight.
Before we all go down forever.
Hold on tight now dance with me.
