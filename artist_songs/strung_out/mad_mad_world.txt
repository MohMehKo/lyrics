A friend is dead you look so hard 
But you can't find a cause what does it mean? 
In one brief moment a life is lost what does it a life of hurtin, 
A life of chore, what does it mean? when all we leave is just a memory, 
It's a mad mad world we're all doing time in a mad mad world, 
We're all left behind in a mad mad world, 
And all we leave is just a memory I think about the things you said 
"live each day like it was your last" I think about your life, 
And how it went by so fast 
When you lose a friend it hurts so fuckin bad inside. 
Especially when that friend commits suicide. 
A friend is dead you can look so hard to try a find a cause 
What does it mean in one brief moment a life is lost... 
All I have is your memory
