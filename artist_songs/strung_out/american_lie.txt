Can you see it in their eyes
The madness and the pain
A state of mind could rip the fearing face 
Off one man and conform 
They tried

The new division of obedience
A plan for all to heed
They make the laws and preempt the debt
We don't question how they do it

Well I can slowly feel this riddle come undone
As I stand upon the face of regret and I realize what we've done
Addiction among the artificial bliss, it's a false reality
And all along and I'm so alive

Lack of cheer with shaded eyes
The great American lie
To believe we're ancestors of obedience
Until the day you die

Well I can slowly feel this riddle come undone
As I stand upon the face of regret and I realize what we've done
Addiction among the artificial bliss, just a false reality
And all along I'm so alive
