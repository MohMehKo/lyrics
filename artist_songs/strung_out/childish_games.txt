Now I can see through the games that you play and why the
Games you play them with me I don't understand if you love
Someone [?] such agony another time another place would
Maybe be different but right now it's far to late right here,
Right now, right away [?] my feelings I just can't escape so
Tell me, just tell me why don't you know how hard I try just
Tell me where I went wrong just tell me and I'll be gone I don't
Care about society in general I know now we're all built the
Same but society can make you hurt another person I hear
The cries of your pain you tell me truth, you tell me lies your
Different so I'm blind [?] and I got left behind you play your 
Games you play with me to make others think your cool the
Only real thing you ever knew you threw away, your a fool
[Chorus]
And I don't care about society in general I know now
We're all built the same but some of us grow up faster than
Others while others play childish games
