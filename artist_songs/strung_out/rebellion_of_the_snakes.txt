Collapsing global void economy
Erecting chaos to the heart of me
Race and faith aligned in vertigos
There are no atheists in these rabbit holes
Televise the rebellion
So we can feed 'em to the dogs

Phosphorous and secret holy wars
Hieroglyphic radio and sacred doors
Eradicate the shadow of a doubt cuz
The morphine drip is gonna see you out

We are devoid of religion
We are the science of it all
We are the sin of the song
We are the end of it all
As we give in...

To the forces that pull you along
The science of never really living at all
The right or wrong
The sin in the song
The perfect ending to your war
Warning shadows lead me along
For right or wrong we all carry on

The past is dead don't exist anymore
The present is passing quicker than before
Emancipation to the end of the line
I will not follow where I've been before
The only weapon we got is our song
The only way we could stand up at all 
We scream together, we die alone
In the end your story is all you own

We are devoid of religion
We are the science of it all
And when forever came calling
We never thought that we'd give in...

To the forces that pull you along
The science of never really living at all
The possibility of going home
The rebellion we start to save our own
This will be broadcast on the nation's door
It's the perfect ending to your war

The past is dead it don't exist anymore
The present is passing quicker than before 
The past is dead I don't wanna anymore
So I will not follow where you've taken me before
