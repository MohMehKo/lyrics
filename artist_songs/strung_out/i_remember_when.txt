I stand alone listening to the sound that you offered me
Having such a power shine for all of us to see
Leave me hangin' on to the things that could have been
And leave me lonely with this note till I remember when
I remember when my childhood fears did subside
I remember when the adult killed the child inside
I remember when yes I remember when
I remember when yes I remember when
All my nights are lonely, and all the cries that were never heard
All taught me a big lesson that love is a very big word
Always told me look, be honest, see the upper hand
What those words did to me is put a bullet in my head
I remember when my childhood fears did subside
I remember when the adult killed the child inside
I remember when yes I remember when
I remember when yes I remember when
So many things we soon forget
The many things we all regret
Should've known to let you go
You should've known to let me go
Many times that we would fight
The way you keep me up all night
Should've known to let you go
You should have known to let me go
Let me go!
I remember when yes I remember when
I remember when yes I remember when
I remember when yes I remember when
I remember when yes I remember when
