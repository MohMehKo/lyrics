No miracles gonna save you now
No profound word's gonna show
You how
No revelation's gonna change the way
You live
No wise man's gonna come
And take your hand
No awakening lies in store for you
No effort you submit will deliver you.
No picture worth a million words
No Salvation worth a million lives
Will ever open your eyes so that
You could really see
You've come this far doin what
You do so why change now
Your doin fine
I'll candy coat another rhyme for you.
You're on a speedball
And it's goin' straight to hell
And I don't wanna get in your way
You're on a rocket and it's goin'
Straight down
You've lit the fuse set
The fire now there's no one
Left to save you.
Someone pulled the chair right
Under you, now you're swingin' by the
Neck and still you continue to smile
Step right up and get your fix
Climb back to your crucifix
We're burnin' the world down tonight.
No new improved better lookin' god
No antiestablishmentariant?
Punk rock song will save the world
Tonight
We're on a speedball goin' to hell
A one-way trip to Candyland and you
Ain't got no reason to fight
You don't have the answers
You don't have the solutions
Somehow it always ends up
Working out.
