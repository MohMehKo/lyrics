When I was young, America meant to me
- land of the beautiful and land of the free. 
now I look around and all I see are Americans in poverty. 
we're all lost without a trace we can't keep up, 
can't find our place we're all lost without a clue
and our leaders never know what to do. 
taking things slow--one step at a time, making sure we get left behind. 
dreams of success, well they're all gone. 
this American way of life I've been robbed! 
we're all lost without a trace we can't keep up, 
can't find our place we're all lost without a clue 
and our leaders never know what to do.
