Wouldn't understand if I told you so
Wouldn't care to see if I tried to show
Wouldn't know what to do if I made you feel
Like I feel today so don't bring me down

So don't bring me down
Cause the world keeps turning

A little stranger than fiction in life
Everybody's got their own world to live through
We've all got our song to write
It starts a dirty little secret that won't stay quiet

Silhouette against the angry sky
These skyscrapers a mile high
Won't hide me long enough to get by
These troubles of mine are never that far behind

And what's coming to the helicopter sound
All this shit's going down
In the world right in front of me
I'm a suicide cause
With a sidewalk soul
I got somethin' in my head
And I'm going for a walk around

A little stranger than fiction in life
Everybody's got their own world to live through
We've all got our song to write
It starts a dirty little secret that won't stay quiet tonight

I got nothing but time
To take a walk and find
What I never could explain
Or make you understand
There's nothing in here you'd be interested to hear
So ignore me if this doesn't rhyme

I swear there won't be
I swear there won't be a next time
So walk on by if you see me in your way
Cause you wouldn't understand if I told you anyway
You wouldn't even care if I tried to explain

A little stranger than fiction in life
Everybody's got their own world to live through
We've all got our song to write
It starts a dirty little secret that won't stay quiet

A little stranger than fiction in life
Everybody's got their own world to live through
We've all got our song to write
It starts a dirty little secret that won't stay quiet tonight

Won't stay quiet tonight
