This goddamn car is broken down again
Looks like I'm sleeping in the back and I'll be dreaming of a better place
Only to call you in the morning with the same excuse again
By the side of the freeway, watching all the cars go by

I think that tomorrow will be the day
I get my shit together and give up this crying game
I've been here before and I'll be here again
I don't know why but it don't feel the same

For one moment, I can see clearly
The weight of the world don't seem so bad
Then I find myself here, right back where I started from again

Indecision's no solution to the days that lay ahead
So I begin to scramble in my head for the answers
Only to find myself shut down by the same mistakes again
Looking over my shoulder for the things that pass me by

I know that tomorrow will be the same
I'll find a new excuse to make the same mistakes again
I've been here before, I know I'll be here again
So many wasted hours, so many wasted intentions

For one moment, I can see clearly
The weight of the world don't seem so bad
Then I find myself here, right back where I started from again

I beat myself up to survive
I got a bulletproof plan to stay alive
If I could only find a job, if I could only find the means
If I could only learn this lesson the first time around

I wouldn't be stuck in another mess
In another rut with the same old stress

For one moment, I can see clearly
The weight of the world don't seem so bad
I think tomorrow will be the day that
I get my shit together and give up this chaos

'Cause I've been here before
And I know that I will be here once again
