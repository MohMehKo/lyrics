This day we dance away through our obsession
cut away the pain with surgical precision
A static flash to burn your minds eye
emotionless in doubt
now you don't ever have to feel anything anymore
Anything anymore....

As the skeleton dance, for another chance

Another day alone with our perversions
To eat away ourselves is our religion
If you get me high I'll be right where you are
Just like everybody else, aching for a better view 

You and I will scream for more
We can make this so much more

Kill the body and the head'll thrive along
Kill the body and the head'll lead you on
All the coward souls in this place we live
Reside me to wonder if this is really where we all belong

Skeletons dream of touch this close
Curiosity pushes the nail deeper
Fingertips dream of touch this close
Curiosity pushes the nail deeper

Here and now we'll scream for more
We can make this so much more
Kill the body and the head'll thrive along
Kill the body and the head'll lead you on

As the skeleton dance
