This is the alter of my downfall 
a symbol of this glorious demise
Well I'm in flames and getting deeper
all contact lost is no surprise
I'm sitting here alone
the silence heavier than me tonight
A lost soul found and sold again
A broken stride reborn again
Here among these gilded pages
Now its sanctuaries one last stand

To never have to speak again
To never say your name again
To never tell another lie 
to live in the honesty of the eyes

Create your own defence
and keep a secret tight 
Tonight there will be no sound 
In golden silence we'll be found

To never have to say goodbye
when it hurts too much to just get by
honesty will be a glace away

We're not far, don't say anything

When all the words of the poets lie meaningless
When all the trivial delusions 
all lose their place in the arms of those who wonder why 
nothing really matters 

Tonight all be no sound 
in silence we'll be found 
a little less exaggerated
To never say goodbye
To never tell a lie
To never come across so jaded

To never curse your name again
To never take the blame again
To never get the last word everytime we've got nothin' good to say
