Scarlet you got everything I want
You're my pistol my pollution
And my secret alibi
We got no music but we can dance around this death
Cause nothing moves you like extinction
and you know I'm always game

So let's forget the small talk
On this eve of destruction baby
hollowed be our name
this hell is where we hide
Drown with a lost soul and maybe
the eerie glare of neon will last all night

we drone on we persist without an end 
we destroy all life around us
we are the beauty from within
and I been tortured by my place in all of this
but you assure me of my purpose 
what we are we've always been

So lets embarace the downfall
on this eve of destruction baby
hollowed from within
we got no where to hide
Damned with no secrets and maybe
the eerie glare of heaven will shine all night

And now I watch your shaking hands 
embrace the window as you stare into the light
We both know theres no escaping what we are
but we still persist and fight

On this eve of destruction baby
hollowed be our name 
we are the end of days
Drown with a lost soul and maybe
the eerie glare of heaven will go on forever
