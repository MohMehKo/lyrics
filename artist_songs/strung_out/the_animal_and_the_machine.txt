For every bullet in your gun we’ve got plan
To change the world and make it better 
This song’s for everyone screaming from the pit 
We are the soundtrack
We bleed together strong 
Nobody here's pretending that we got this figured out 
Some things are better unknown 
We all got something that we feel better let it out 
Before the whole thing blows 

We've all 
Been down this road before 
Our history 
It shows exactly what we're headed for 

Can't save the world but you can always tend the neighborhood 
I wanna live and die for something good 
Emancipate the soul
Tell your brother he's not alone 
Cuz life's too fucking short to become victims of each other 

We are the story of the animal and the machine 
We are more than just life
We are serrated by the things we always hated 
So what's the point of all 

The dogs 
Layin’ at our feet 
These battle songs 
Playing on repeat 
Ocean tides
Crashing at our knees
As the stranger in us all finds comfort 
Somewhere in the heart of the machine

Gutter angels played guitar when you couldn't sleep
You’re the reason you’re the consequence
You howl cuz you’re goin’ mad 
In the chaos of this consecration a room without a view
Time will only take from us 
What we knew we’d always lose 

We are the story of the animal and the machine 
We are more than just life
We are serrated by the things we always hated 
So what's the point of all 

The dogs 
Layin’ at our feet 
These battle songs 
Playing on repeat 
Ocean tides 
Crashing at our knees 
As the stranger in us all finds comfort 
Somewhere in the heart of the machine
