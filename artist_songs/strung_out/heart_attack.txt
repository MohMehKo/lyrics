Cities burn and fall into the sea.
When all faith is lost you believe in me?
When the darkness falls never to be seen again by anyone.

When my heart attacks will you stand by me?
Will you guide me through the end?

All these broken things we leave behind 
will be the only beauty you will find 
on this island lost under red November skies.

When my heart attacks will you stand by me through the seasons in my head?
We just need to build communication so I can feel where you're comin' from.
I don't have to hear a word you say to know how it's goin' down.
This life'll kill us before we ever get it right.

This weight of gravity pushin' on my mind, 
every heartbeat just a beat in time.
This distant star what does it really mean at all?

When it all collapses down to the root note, when the sun begins to fade away.
I don't have to hear a word you say to know exactly how you're feelin'.
Your expression betrays and life's too short run away.
Let the sun come up burn us away.

What does it mean to a world without an end 
when the heart won't heal and the body won't pretend.
And all these things and all these lies 
become the weight that finally gets us in the end.

When my heart attacks will you stand by me through the seasons in my head?
We just need to build communication so I can feel where you're comin' from.
Now you can see where I'm comin from, so we can become something else.
I don't have to hear a word you say to know how it's goin' down.
This life'll kill us before we ever get it right.
Your life's too short run away.
Let the sun come up burn us away.
