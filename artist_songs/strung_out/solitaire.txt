I hurt myself again today,
Feeling a little numb I could use the pain.
I always find myself in this little bind.
It's been a few weeks since you've been around,
So here I sit with my hands strapped down 
Patiently awaiting our secret games we used to play all alone, 

So here I sit all tied up,
All alone with all my thoughts,
I do not mind if this goes on.

I think about about what I'll say to you
When you finally decide to come my way,
I'm sitting around all painted like a fool,
And I don't know how I got this way, 
And I don't know how much more I wanna take.
But I know you'll shoot me down, and bury me before I get too high.

So here I sit all tied up 
All alone with all my thoughts 
When will I learn to walk away
From the things I do that make me feel the way, 
I feel when I'm with you? 
Tonight it's me, myself and I

All this pain I seem to put myself through, 
All the ways I find to submit to you
Cat o' nine tails getting old
And I don't know how I got this way 
I don't know how much more I wanna take.
A million ways to tame myself and a million nights to try

So here I sit all tied up 
All alone with all my thoughts 
When will I learn to walk away
From the things I do that make me feel the way, 
I feel when I'm with you? 
Tonight it's me, myself and I

When you come around
Do the things you do to me
I hate this game of solitaire
