No one knows where I buried my sweet Virgina Madison
The winter chill falls over me and keeps me numb inside
Under the moon, by the edge of town, she'll quietly wait for me
I promised it wouldn't be too long till I returned to sleep with her

She said she don't wanna live no more
Well I don't mind; no, I don't mind
So now I'm waiting for the crack of dawn
To head on back there to the place where me and her will always be

Now I got my Sunday vest and I'm headed out that door
I dig my fingers deep in soil just to get to her
All dressed in black and she's so pale, she's waiting there for me
A blanket of soil covers us to fall asleep in eternity

And now I close my eyes

When I awake with a snap, it was all a dream
I got an empty bottle of something under me
I got a really bad headache, my clothes are soaking wet
It's times like this I wish I hadn't slept

Star-locked gaze, uneasy hands
Then the dream fades away and leaves my head
Another riddle, another dream, another fucked-up fantasy
I gotta learn to stay away from all this TV

She said she will always wait for me
Well I don't mind; no, I don't mind
So now I'm heading to the place where I
Buried my sweet Virginia Madison
