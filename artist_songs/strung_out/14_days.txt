My day begins with a sigh as I slowly feel awake. 
Then it's off to work thinkin how much shit I have to take
It's been two weeks since I've had a smile upon my face. 
I miss the days when all I know fits in it's place
14 days I killed myself alone, 
Tried so hard to understand
I'll never forgive you my world came crashing down
As if I stood aside 
And watched all the monsters in my head
Control everything I feel 
I can see the door that traps me in this place 
I can see my way outta here
But I just can't find the key.
