I'm not asking for that much
I only want the truth
when you tell me how you feel
I'm not gonna play the games
that make you feel like shit
I'm not asking for the world
How many times must we tell each other
lies and separate our lives
I wonder what went wrong
I'm not askin' for the world
when were young it's only fun
it's just the chances that you take
now we're grown up and we're fucked up
and we make the same mistakes
we keep repeating the same beating
like it's not a choice to make
and then we're lying and denying
what we won't refuse to change
I feel like I've been through so much shit
so many dysfunctional relationships
that I don't know what to feel anymore
I'm not asking for that much
just be real with me
I'm not asking for the world
