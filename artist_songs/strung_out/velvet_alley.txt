You can't make me see what you think I should know
you don't understand where I'm coming from
we're passing through worlds no perception in time
I'm not the same as when I began

Show me don't tell me 
what's going on inside your little world
You say we never landed on the moon,
you heard we never reached the sky
then shed some light I'll lend a patient ear

Don't let me down I gotta know
if something good could grow out on this rock
save me one more time
and I'll be free from the way I think it ought to be

Babble on
Could I be wrong

A silhouette of you and me
just negative space and time
just reference to a simpler history
I'd sacrifice a million nights for a moments peace with you
reflections to dissect reality

It's all in what we hold as being real
when the symbol kills the substance then we've lost
save me one more time
and I'll be free from the alleyways of my heart

(you can't make me see what you think I should know)
I'm going nowhere
I'm going nowhere inside this head of mine.

(you can't make me see what you think I should know)
we're going nowhere
we're going nowhere inside this head of mine.

sit and stay awhile
talk to me about the things that make you real
let's forget about all that make you and me surrender
surrender
