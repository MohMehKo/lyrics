There's a blood stain on the floor 
By the door where your whole world fell and died. 
There's a silent chair in the corner of the room 
Where you sat alone and cried. 
Well she got something to say to you, 
But the words never mean a thing, 
So she took that needle to her pain and set herself free. 
Burn! burn it to the ground. 
When times got tough you got a little tougher 
Then you slowly fell behind. 
Running to catch the things you could not see, 
Running to catch what you could not find. 
Well I never wanted to need you, now it's time for you to see, 
This forgotten pain that you tried to hide, buried in your apathy. 
Burn! burn all to the ground...
