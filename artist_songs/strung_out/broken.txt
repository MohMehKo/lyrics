The secret, kept safely hid in your mind,
Betrays you when you look into my eyes. 
Broken are the bonds that used to bind you and I. 
Broken like a promise bred from your world of lies. 
Broken are the dreams, the ones you let slip away. 
Broken, broken, broken
Trust me: two words I've heard once before. 
Shelter your eyes from all that is real. 
Broken and distorted, your reality within, 
Your fucked up little world's a shame of need and denial. 
I can't, stand by, and let, you lead me through this path it's broke, it's broken.
Noises - the ones you hear in your mind. 
They lead you away from something that's real
Broken are the bonds that used to bind you and I. 
Broken like a promise bred from your world of lies. 
Broken are the dreams, the ones you let slip away. 
Broken, broken, broken.
Broken and distorted, your reality within, 
Your fucked up little world's a shame of need and denial. 
I won't stand by and let you lead me through this path it's broke, it's broken.
