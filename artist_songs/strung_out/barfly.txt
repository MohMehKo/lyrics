One more fix just a little bit of that 
Heaven I found crawling in the sun
Sitting, waiting, calling me 
To indulge in this game that'll set me free

Another wasted night and here I am again
Promises remain just promises and I don't know why
A moment of weakness is a moment of clarity
I know what I want
Why fight the temptation when it's all you've got
When it's all I've ever known

So I give in to the ways of the past and start to suck
Once again I drown myself delivering from all I've gained
Lies to myself always seem to justify the means
I've got no time to listen to your good advice
I'm doin' just fine
Down on my own down here

I know one day this dance will bring me to my knees
It's only a matter of time before I fall again but that's alright
It's the little things in life that always mean the most to me anyway
So what if I go with a little piece of heaven to take the edge away

Just like the living dead that walk around this place
It's not so bad here in the closet, found the peace of mind I never had
Call it escape from reality, I call it looking at the world
With both eyes open wide to the truth, yeah

I wanna be found smilin' when I die here
I wanna burn my eyes out on the sun
In heaven's basement you're the one that killed me first
Another endless night goes down

One more fix just a little bit
Of heaven I found crawling in my sun
Sitting, waiting, calling me
To indulge in this game that's gonna set me free
A moment of weakness is all I got and it's all I've ever known
Another wasted night and here I am...
