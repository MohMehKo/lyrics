Here I can hold em off for a while 
at least till I think of a way 
to make them see what I gotta show
and to make them feel what I already know now
pour the gas all over me 
light a match say a prayer and set me free 
turn your cameras on this burning boy 
I'll be the life of an image you can't destroy 
to see me here is to pass me by
and to watch me live is to watch me die 
your conscience ignored your panic spread 
you're whimper in the wind that no one said 
you crucify what you fear hold up to the light make it shine 
the desperation in my eyes is no dim reflection I won't disguise 
but you never listened too afraid to give 
now I'm giving up on you
to save face and deny you've lost your chance for a better way 
assassinate the threat 
immortalize the corpse 
write a book about the show 
and sell it to the source 
riddle me this and I'll share your world around
hang me on your wall and I'll bring your hurt down
