Think that I'm a loser
'Cause now my pants are too low
Think that I'm a slob
'Cause I got holes in my shoes
Think I'm Strung Out 
Just like my dirty shirt
Well you can fuck off
'Cause I'm working sixty a week
You think that life is really tough
When your daddy won't buy
You a brand new car
Take a girl out she won't fuck you
You just brought her a gram of coke
Spend all your money on shitty drugs
I'm not a loser! That's right,
I'm not a loser!
Cruise down the boulevard
Wasting Mommy's gas while you're
Looking for kicks on Friday night
You're only goal in life
Is to smoke a joint
And decide how you're gonna get
Laid tonight
You are a fucking son-of-a-bitch

You arrogant asshole
Your pants are too tight
You fucking homo
You suck, Mr. Butt fuck
You don't belong here
No away you fucking gay
I'm not a loser!
