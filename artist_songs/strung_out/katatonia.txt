Impoverished and bleeding
hope here something fast receding 
dead light holocaust
I check this body in tonight 
cross my heart and hope to die
to never leave this place alive
I'm burning right in front of you
I break myself against you I lay still

Your penetrating glances 
dead stop all my vain advances 
to another place 
where I can truly be myself
respirators kicked on high
life support keeps me alive
to forgive I will never do
one last kiss is all I need from 

(You ride)
Salvation going under
(They say)
They say I won't survive you
I wish I never knew you
your name is katatonia

(You ride)
Salvation going under
(They say)
They say I won't survive you
(Your name)
Your name is sanctuary
I call you katatonia
