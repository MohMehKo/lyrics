Tell me what you want from me
Cause I don't know exactly
What you want me to be
There's no place left for me
To go now so why don't you
come kick me around for a while
Down here you won't see me cryin'
Ain't got no time for that
I've planned a million ways to
Sacrifice myself now
Seems every time I try to gain a
Little ground-I wind up right back
Where I never thought I'd be
Down here it feels alright
Plenty of time
To find another way.
Self-destruction's the only way
I know how to
Maybe another time, maybe another
Day, I'll be strong enough to leave
This place behind me
Like a clown I'll raise my glass
To the sky and toast another night
Serenadin' my reflection
[Chorus]
Plenty of time to find another
Way to seize the day without this bottle
of redemption
So tonight I'll stumble my way
Home, maybe tomorrow I'll find
Myself a job
But tonight I got the moon
And the stars I got a song in
My head and a pocket full of nothin'
Well I got no plans got
No peace of mind
I gotta find a may outta here
Took a little more than I gave away
Now it's up to me to get up and
Try to get it right.
