At times I sit and wonder what's it all mean 
Violence and suffering [?] everyday [?]
But progress has destroyed us [?]
I ponder more, I better of buy myself 
Think about the dusty bible sitting on my shelf 
Used to believe their was a father 
So bright but he's not there 
It's just a lie we're not going to heaven 
We're already in hell we're all damaged here 
And I wish you well I wonder where you are now 
And why you had to leave but my bloods so cold 
And my heart is cold and I have not time to breath 
I ponder more, I'm better off by myself 
Think about the dusty bible sitting on my shelf 
Used to believe their was a father 
So bright but he's not there 
It's just a lie I've [?] too many times to even bother to write
Don't tell me what's wrong don't tell me what's right 
Take your hopes and dreams and walk ahead of me 
Cause in the end [?]
