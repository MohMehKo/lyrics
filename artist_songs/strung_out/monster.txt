Time it makes you old, experience makes you wise.
And it's only a fool who judges life by what he sees in other people's eyes.
The decisions that you cast effect the outcome of your game the
Only person who's gonna think about you is the one that's standin' in your shoes

Live by the sword die by the sword I'm a weapon of my set.
The only family that I've ever known is the gun that's by my side

Little big man he's not alone now, 
He's all grown up his stories
Written all along these city walls.
Found unity, he's gained a brotherhood as they gather to beat you down
The fists reign hard, the fightin' never stops.
There's no mercy in this town

And I don't know when it's gonna' end for me
This side of town is all I know it's all I see
If I go on like this I'm gonna'
End it all myself one day
It's my destiny it's my reality
It's society.

I wear colors proud but stare me down
I've got a million scars to prove my pain
You think you know who I am
Try walking a mile in my shoes.

Quick on the draw never walk alone
Know your enemy never be afraid, 
It's what they always say
Till they come around for you.

Ghetto birds light the evening
Sky as the sun begins to fall
Another night he'll spend in this
Jungle with his back up against the wall

Little big man he's not alone now, 
He's all grown up his stories
Written all along these city walls.

Quick on the draw never walk alone
Know your enemy never be afraid, 
It's what they always say
Till they come around for you.
