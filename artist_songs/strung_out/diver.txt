There is a place I know through misery and stone
Under myriads neglected and cold
Where sadness blossoms overgrown

There's a shadow in the garden where we sit and wait alone

There is a grave beneath the shadow somber with neglect
No roses have been granted no prayer has been sent

There's a shadow in the garden where my love and I await
Silent as the day we left it all behind my little

Diver, we'll rise again 
Diver, we'll live again
Diver, and the cities we once dreamed will open for us

And the ruins of another time another world
Will greet us on our way at the end of it all

There's a shadow in the garden where my love and I await
Silent as the day we left it all behind my little

Diver, we'll rise again 
Diver, we'll live again
Diver, and the cities we once dreamed will open for us

Like a dream in darkness reaching out for you
Bone and dust in shrouded velvet me and you

To feel the sun against my back
You know I'd do it all again
You know I'd live it all again
You know I wouldn't change a thing
To walk out of this place and live

You know I'd do it all again
You know I'd do it all again
You know I'd do it all again
You know I'd do it all again

I wouldn't change a single thing
Just like a dream, we'll live again
We'll live again
