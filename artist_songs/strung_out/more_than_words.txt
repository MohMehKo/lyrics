What's the point of asking if you know why
What's the point of caring if we don't try
What's the point of fighting if we never understand

Give a little just to show you're out there
That will stand for something more than words
I'm admitting to myself its something I ain't getting
I've been lying to myself its something I don't want

In just a moment it can all change
With just a promise I will never be the same

I'm so sick of wasting time
Throwing things away
Are you with me or are you against
Together but always alone

Why does everything we care for wither
Into a question we cant answer
Are we getting better are we growing all the time
Or have we reached the end of all we'll ever find

Another heartache, another question
Another moment we will never be the same

I'm so sick of wasting time
Throwing things away
Are you with me or are you against
Together but always alone

Are you there
Cause I cant see you anymore
All I see is anger as you turn around and tell me
This will be the last time

I'm so sick of wasting time
Throwing things away
Are you with me or are you against
Together but always alone

More than words
Together but always alone
More than words
Together but always alone
