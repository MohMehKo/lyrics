My distant morning shines mute witness
To another sleepless night
Reminds me I've been awake for days
With silence in my chest
My bloodless empty veins remind me nothing stays the same
It's like waking dream
A possibility fleeting like a memory
How do I explain this life as it passes and changes before my eyes

Another day of breathing, waking next to you
The world could end and I'd be fine right here where I am

You're a witness to these words I breathe
You'll never have to go it alone
You sleep and on I drone
The madness here it only grows
While you maintain and unify
The darkest part of 'I
From the valley in my heart I sing this melody

Another day of breathing, waking next to you
The world could end and I'd be fine right here where I am
To paint the world a little more blue and show you how
My distant morning shines without you

In golden hues of disorder
As I suffocate through another line 
You sleep and I drone on
Well there ain't no hell like the one inside
In every breath of mine
We live in moments we can't define

Another day of breathing, waking next to you
The world could end and I'd be alright where I am
To paint the world a little more blue and show you how
As the distant morning shines through me
You'll never have to go it alone

The days move on and leave behind the remnants of the love we find
And the silence in my chest resolves that I'll never make it here alone
