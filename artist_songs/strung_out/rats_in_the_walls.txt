It was written I should be loyal to this nightmare that we're in
But something about all the sorrow in your heart that won't let me in
Like the hands of a fool with money to burn
In the breath of one last dying wish
We hear the call and it sounds like there's

Rats in the walls 
It's like the dark side of the moon
Serenade me with a whisper and let this nightmare in us bloom

Where do I send all my money?
Who'll deliver the nails through my heart
When I've gone and set it all up burning like the walls
In the ghetto of this reckless love
Bow down with a whimper to pass the time
Or hold me down and take what's mine
Put my head under water and drink my wine
And watch me take it all way too far
Lip service to the one that gave you your crown
You're holding your breath as you're waiting to drown
The echoes in your head bounce around like

Rats in the walls
It's like the dark side of the moon
Serenade me with a whisper and let this nightmare in us bloom
Tonight I'm all dressed here in black I got your monkey on my back
We are not what we say we mean everything we do
And tonight I'm gonna kill another part of you

Stimulation hollow transmission ill defined
At the center of our hearts a signal too obscure to find
Acoustic shadows sex and chaos and the sound of you and me
Here all roads defy your gravity

I have been here all along with the rats in the walls
It's like the dark side of the moon
Serenade me with a whisper and let this nightmare in us bloom
Tonight I'm all dressed here in black I got your monkey on my back
We are not what we say we mean everything we do
And tonight I'm gonna kill another part of you
