I can feel the murky grip of a cold depression coming down
I can feel her hands around my neck shake me to the ground
Ice burn of the soul, in light, in sickness and in death
Infected every word and every thought and every single breath

Twisted by design, the creeps deep inside of me
Feeding off this hunger, rage and the insecurity
Tempted by the rage, I feed off nothing but myself
Thirsty for the things that make me do this to myself

My pen is dripping the words along to scrape the smile off my face
Every detour leads me here to shower in this waste

You are my friend
But now you're just living all over me

You watch me when I get it right, you watch me when I fall
Watch me every single day, listen to every word I say
I swear I never wanted you; I never needed anything from your
Twisted, fucked-up, lying words, asleep at the wheel

My pen is dripping words the along to scrape the smile off my face
Every detour leads me here to shower in this waste

You are my friend
