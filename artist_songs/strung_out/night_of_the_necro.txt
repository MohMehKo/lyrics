No time, coming down, burning up the sky
The hero was waiting and all hope had been lost
There came a shape of twisted metal, proclaiming astral-murder
Pushing a never ending darker age

They came and took you away, now half the battle has been lost
I drove around up and down this burned out town

It started in the graveyards rectifying what was left 
Of who recently deceased, it gives them life
This plague condemned the cities, killing armies with him where they stood
Infection and destruction, no one had a chance

They came and took you away, this subliminal hymn has been sent
He walks all the way, "So this is hell?" he asks
Postmortematic shock, troops marching up and down, reality

Electro-magnetic pulse of radiating corpses 
Started emanating, knee-jerk resistance
Moving through defenses, but severed at the base
In the ashes of the cities we'll build another race

To grow, to bleed, this blood's a flood
To rise and take what belongs to us
To grow, to defeat, to burn
To finally crush and take away

They came and took you away, now half the battle has been lost
