You crows, you carried me through another night
To get back down and I'm going crazy
I'll be starving at your feast tonight
Taking all my cues from the city light
Where we are just barely holding on

Now we sleep underneath the freeway bridge
We belong nowhere and to no one
Not knowing where we got lost

With California at my back
And the whole world in a paper bag
Another state of mind might do me alright
We do desolation style, murders, hope for the mile
Never really knowing what we've got
So we lose it to an afterthought
Do we deserve this life?

And in everywhere, I've seen my share
Of the ways that we all let each other down
And I wonder why

Not all who wander here are lost
Not all who seek that peace of mind
Wonder where they're going
We know exactly where we've been
And we know this ain't a game you play to win
You can find yourself on an even trade
Down familiar roads

Never gonna make it out alive
Whatcha gonna leave here when you die
Take a chance on me and meet me at the darkest road
We've done just enough to get us by
No more than just barely alive
We ain't sleeping no more
With hearts too deep to drown

Not all who wander here are lost
Not all who seek that peace of mind
Wonder where they're going
We know exactly where we've been
And we know this ain't a game you play to win
You can find yourself, on an even trade
Down familiar roads

You crows, you carried me through another night
And I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy
I'll be starving at your feast tonight
Taking all my cues from the city lights
Where we are just barely holding on
Just barely holding on
Just barely holding on
Just barely holding on
Just barely holding on
Just barely holding on
