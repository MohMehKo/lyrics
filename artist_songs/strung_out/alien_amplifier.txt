Just one more verse I swear
Just one more line to rhyme with the last one
I didn't really mean to write at all

And its all my fault
I'm wasting precious time
On words that never seem to get through to anybody else

Here alone I don't know what I want to say
When you're around I got a lot to write about
And words are lies
Convienice in disguise
Communication scratched down and overanalyzed

When its all your fault
I've broken everything
I own unable to spit out
While you're standing there waiting for me

Here alone I don't know what I want to say
When you're around I got a lot to think about
And words are lies
Convienice in disguise
And we'll never really let each other in

And we're all dead
Communications dead
And I'm no better than the worst I speak about
Give me sound
Some frequency in line
To you understand what you really want to say

Here alone I don't know what I want to say
But when you're down I got a lot to write about
And words are lies
Convienice in disguise
And we'll never really let each other in
