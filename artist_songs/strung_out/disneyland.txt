I want something more 
From this misery called life 
It's hard to keep my dreams alive 
There's all this pain and strife 
I dream of a place where all of us can hide 
A world where my answers can never be denied 
[?] I want to move to Disneyland 
And forget about this place 
What better way to get away 
From the fucked up human race 
I want to go to a world [?]
No way to make believe [?] to Disneyland 
And I never want to I never want to leave [?]
