One more time then I'll know 
one more lie then I'll go away 
pour another drink 
and I'll ease myself into the comforts of your philosophy
try to understand your friend in need and I'm here to make it easier 
you and I are one in the same 
we're built alike in so many ways 
you can't understand and you won't accept 
your secrets are all safely kept here
inside we're so lost 
I can be the one to find you 
everything that you deserve 
no request will ever go unheard 
you're better off without me now 
but without me here you're just better off alone 
just wait and see 
you're just like me 
conversation's getting stale 
a penny for your thoughts 
one small betrayal
does no man know what he's good for 
does no man want what he's asked for 
it takes our design 
I've spent a lifetime waiting for the chance to chase these devils away
but they always come smiling when you need 'em the most 
so I'll end this night alone again
with nothing to offer and nothing to give conversations spoken in vein alone 
so go away it's easier if I stay so go away it's easier this way
