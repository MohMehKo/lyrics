Some say in the darkest places, love can grow
This solitary romance we'll never know
Well it's this coffin break I'm staging to the road that leads me back to you
Will be the miracle I gave up everything to only be with you 
Can't seem to shake the loneliest curse of all 
Eternity with just a memory 
I've seen your picture a million times three sixes and a melody of 
Singing vice and a varice in the chains you chose to be our dress for
My funeral for two a carnival in blue
Can't seem to shake the loneliest curse of all 
Eternity spent chasin' what I shun 
All is ghost in memory and poison in the sun 
In the sun...na na na they bury us in the sand 
na na na together hand in hand
I can't seem to shake the loneliest 
Curse of all eternity spent chasing what I was
All is ghost in memory and poison in the sun
