Your democracy has become a tattered vision of truth, 
corporate sponsorship, rapin' & ruling the land, 
do you think what you say will make it any better, 
it's been this way two hundred years, 
will stay this way forever! you made promises of health 
care still my teeth rot in my head.
you once seemed so concerned now you left us all for dead. 
the unemployed, the uninsured, the homeless in the street, 
we're the ones that put you there, buddy you've got promises to keep. 
we won't survive, this road to power led by all your kings. 
it's time to wake up and take back what you have lost. 
and when it all falls from this malady spread from within, 
it's happened once before, my friend, well here it comes again. 
this state we've built is a sick reflection of 
all that we've become we've closed our eyes, 
been fed these lies do you know what your country's done. 
in the land of mad consumers free to spend at their own will, 
we're losing sight of what it means to be a free america. 
i cannot stand by, and watch them as they fuck up my life. 
believe these lies, they'll lead you to a path in harm's way!
