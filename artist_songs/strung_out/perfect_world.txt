Who needs peace when we've got the bomb 
Who needs to love when you got the bowl 
Who needs money when you've got your credit 
You got your plastic paying all your bills 

Who needs books when you got tv 
You don't need to read with the vcr 
Who needs to cook we got the microwave 
You don't need to walk when you've got a car 

We be livin in a perfect world [?]
A system helpless by itself [?]

Who needs to get up and change the channel 
When the remotes can do that for you 
Who needs children when you've got abortion 
You can kill your babies if you want to 

Who needs books when you got tv 
You don't need to read with the vcr 
Who needs to cook we got the microwave 
You don't have to walk when you've got a car 

[Chorus]
