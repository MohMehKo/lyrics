Your darkness falls against your radiated skies
Night shades flicker, pulse and drone inside your eyes
It reminds me how we used to play
Before we found these modern drugs

Take one last breath and hold you in
Lock the door and let you win
Cuz inside you know my god
It's shaking under me
It's giving head and burning beds
It's holy wars and jealous dead
It's Suicidal radio 
Echoes where we should not go

Somewhere through the hurt we know we survive
This love is just expensive drugs
And we're getting to high to drive

In ritual in all we live
In the chemicals we take to give
On your knees before the fall
Nail you to the wall
No poetry to quote the end 
So I'll hold my breath and keep you in
Rot me out and name your sin
Cuz there's nothing left to win

Somewhere through the hurt we know we survive
This love is just expensive drugs
And we're getting to high to drive
It's in the ritual in the habitual
The longing to want it all
With no frequency electricity we're all addicted to the fall

These antidotes that take the soul
Only erase it all away
Till there's nothing left for the heart to realize
Then vacant and hollow we become a means to an end
And the space between each other gets farther every day
I'm not the one
Gonna make you feel

Somewhere through the hurt we know we survive
This love is just expensive drugs
And we're getting to high to drive
It's in the ritual in the habitual
The longing to want it all
With no frequency electricity we're all addicted to the fall
