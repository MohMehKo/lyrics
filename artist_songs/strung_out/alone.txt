I'm alone, but you point your finger and laugh at me 
And thank god that you are nowhere 
Close to me because we're different and you try so hard to hate me, 
To go home I'm alone and I cannot stay, 
What do you know about being alone 
Has life ever had a suicidal tone, 
No one wants to know me 
For they slip me out, I'm outside looking in think 
I'm under pressure while I'm here today 
But we only know the right words to say 
That has come and gone if they had only known 
They couldn't go through life alone. 
Help me two words I don't know how to say 
I'm in pain but that's a message you can never convey, 
Hear me and I've tried to make you understand without love, 
Life'll kill the strongest man.
