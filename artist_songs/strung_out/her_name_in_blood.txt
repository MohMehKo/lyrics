Mother Mary, bury me in a place they'll never find 
I kill only what I love and what I love was never mine 
Suffocate you outta me, you're the darkest of my sins 
You're burning through my head, don't know where I begin and where you end 

Your breathless violence open veins in silence and devotion, 
sacred and divine 
In this love that makes me it's the hurt that moves me to betray you 
every time you pull me near 

Give it away, give it away, ride this bitch to hell 

And blow a kiss 
When you only think of me 
Hold my hand and fuck away this blankness of expression 
And all sorrows in between 

Her name in blood and her eyes on me 
Her deepest secret lies in front of me 
A whisper now is all that remains of me 

You're the center of my unholy shrine 
Scar tissue in time you're all mine 
You're the last hint of self-control 
My last chance just walked out the door 

Drown out your artery, straight through a love that would never be 

Her name in blood and her eyes on me 
Her deepest secret lies in front of me 
A whisper now is all that remains of me 

This sacrament is our punishment 
I am the worst part of you 
You are the only thing left to burn
