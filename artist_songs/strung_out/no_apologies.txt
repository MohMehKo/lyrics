I wonder if I left this place today
If something went wrong and I couldn't be around to say
All the things I kept from you till you got old enough
Would you hold the world against me or would you understand
So show me something that I used to know
In another life before I grew to where I had to let it go
Now we'll never walk alone

Through fields of time we tow the line
Through all the hurt and damage we find
And every day's another shot to show me everything I've got
We're reckless with no apologies

Would you listen to me and not mistakes that I've made
As I watch this world slowly chip away
That innocence behind your eyes
The beauty in your heart
I look you in the eye to remember all that I forgot

Now every day's a little more than just surviving
As the person that you grow to be is stronger than the best of me
And the possibility and all the space between you and me

Through fields of time we tow the line
Through all the hurt and damage we find
Will it come to be that you're the brightest part of me
We're reckless till the end with no apologies

Now every day's another chance
To find a part of you in me to realize the best in me
Through fields of time we tow the line
Through all the hurt and damage we find
And every day's another shot to show me everything I've got
We're reckless till the end with no apologies

Would you listen to me and not mistakes I've made
As I watch this world slowly slip away
