I spent time alone in a cage just staring at the wall
She has to have been a savior, see, just to have heard the voices call
Excess is just a brutal type thing, she's fucked up in the brain
When she gets that look in her eyes 
You know that mother's gone insane

Daddy won't you please take me home
Cause momma doesn't love us anymore
She did her own killing, more than willing
Now it's time for her to move on

Through places I have hid from momma loves to hide away 
She'll fight for all the kids that come on down with her and play 
I've seen the young, I've seen the old, I've seen the neighbor's wife
I've seen the agony in their eyes, human sacrifice

Daddy won't you please take me home
Cause momma doesn't love us anymore
She did her own killing, more than willing
Now it's time for her to move on

The place by the woods where the children loved to play 
My mother stalks her victims, my mother stalks her prey
Do you know where your children are at
Do you care where they're at tonight
Never look for mercy in her eyes
Human sacrifice 

Daddy won't you please take me home
Cause momma doesn't love us anymore
She did her own killing, more than willing
Now it's time for her to move on

The less I feel my sacrifice my mom is a queen
Gashes are from a thorn, the cut wouldn't bleed
I don't want this anymore 
I can't take this anymore
What have we done 

Naked and alive her flesh soaked with murdered souls
She dances to the voice, it sings sweetly in her ear 
The emptiness is out tonight, the moon is full of life
Don't look for mercy in her eyes
Human sacrifice

Daddy won't you please take me home
Cause momma doesn't love us anymore
She did her own killing, more than willing
Now it's time for her to move on
