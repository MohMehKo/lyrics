And now I think I know
what's on your mind
Your eyes melt through me and it's no surprise
I can become you
and through your eyes I'll watch you
Lie to me
step right over me
as I fall to my knees

Like a movie star
like kerosene
Your burning arrows sinking into me
You're my favorite ache inside
So put down that knife and come lie
Down with me
Step right over me
You can do anything your heart pleasures
You can do anything you want

Just like before
she'll bring me down into that place
We come together and erase
each other one more time

Step back as I set myself up for the kill
I might shoot myself in the foot while I swallow that pill
Stand right above us to unbreak my fall
Your sex with a razor and my blood tells all
Step back as I set myself up for the kill
Shoot myself in the foot while I swallow that pill
Stand right above us to unbreak my fall
Your sex with a razor and my blood tells all

Like a movie star
like kerosene
Burning in my eyes
I can feel you now
here I leave myself wide open now
I leave myself wide open now
It's all I ever knew
