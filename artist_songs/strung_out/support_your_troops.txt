Were gonna pay for russian sand 
Painted with the blood of a fellow man 
Mr. president said theres nothing to fear 
But the look in his eyes say the end is near 
But the bombs they'll fall 
Falling down on me 
Falling down on me 
Falling down like rain 

Support your troops but not their cause 
Your leaders a desperate man 
The tears have passed and now at last 
Were gonna finally take command 
Starting to make him want 
This years re-election for another term 
What a better way to make fun 
O swing guarantee of safe return 

Bet you I'll only loose a few thousand men 
Well that's just the chance I'll have to take 
To get my public off my back 
Battle this domestic crap 
And eveding the mess I will create 

Disappear the diskdrive 
Ignorance on display 
George Bush and the calvaries 
Will blow it all away 
Loyalty will stand up 
And receed in utter black 
The war is that it's over now 
There's no turning back 

The war is that it's over with for now 
Help my people now by stand and wait 
It's just a matter of time 
Before they may make up they're minds 
And will ignore it all some way.
