There's something I can't figure out 
There's something that I can't let go 
It's here it's real and it's staring me in the eye 
It's all I see now 
Growing into something new 
Becoming what I always knew 
Would change me if I let it go 
would turn on me if I let it show now 
If I let it show 
And you always got the best of me 
While bringing out the worst of me 
I found myself again and I didn't like this thing that I've become now 
So I gotta do this right now 
Cause tomorrow I ain't looking back 
This is my last chance to come clean and make it right 
And show you what I know 
Sinking ever further 
Concrete shoes keep me around 
It's getting way to late to change tonight 
Shudder to think I may be wrong 
It's easy to lose when you're the king of loss and everything slips by 
Taken a chance making a change 
For better or worse 
I can't let go 
and I know what I want 
Is what we think of ourselves inside 
The same as what we really are 
Is what you see in me 
really what i wanna be? 
Is this all for me 
Is this all for you? 
Is this all we see in ourselves?
