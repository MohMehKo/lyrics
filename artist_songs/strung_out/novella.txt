My dreams are cold and crawl with regret
Black and white, there's still us shouting out
We might not make it through

This chapter covers time without you
You are a ghost within these pages I call home
That's nothing new

Cause I'm inclined to say I don't mind
That you still come around this place
Survive me every time

Every scar and all the pain that we find in between
All the words are like razorblades
Well it all seemed far, the distance we are
Another world, another time
Like another life we left behind

It's not enough to say I know you
It's like you have all your secrets
I don't know and never will
Like a riddleated pages, nothing new
A silent gesture, screaming out my name
You know this one's for you

Cause I'm inclined to say I don't mind
That you still keep me guessing
Every chapter, every time

Every scar and all the pain that we find in between
All the words are like razorblades
Well it all seemed far, the distance we are
Another world, another time
Like another life we left behind

Well I got my wings and all my good luck things
Pressed between a single page in melodrama
Well this binding's not at all what it used to be
Can't hold this page any longer
Any longer

This story I too shall breathe
The chapters four, five, and three
We done it all with every start
The rest is human, dark and bleak
With fiction, fodder, and disbelief
And somehow we always make it through
