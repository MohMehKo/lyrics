The other day, I swear to God, I got a letter in the mail
That said register with us or you're gonna go to jail
You'll be put inside a cage, then forced to enlist

Well I laughed out loud and said, I won't comply
To be labeled as one of those who qualify
To be shipped off to fight your fucking wars

'Cause war's not about policy
Or religion; it's about economy
And I'm not dying to set your country free

I'll never bow to your expectations; I never have, I never will
I'm not a puppet, pawn or figurehead; I'm a man of my own free will
Our freedoms are slowly surrendered as they take more than their fill
How much power is ever enough for the men, the men on Capitol Hill?

They're cutting back on welfare, illegalizing homelessness
Am I the only one to see there's something wrong with this?
I don't have the answers; won't pretend to say I will
But to put my trust in government; I think, I think I'd rather kill

Oh, mighty word democracy spells freedom for you and me
The books have all been written and the prophets denied
Little by little, watch this state begin to fall
As we awaken from this dream and find ourselves nailed to the wall

Oh, firecracker, patriotic lie
You were burning bright the day the country died
In all your glory, in all your pride

Light the way, torch of Liberty
Light the sky for the whole world to see
In all your glory, in all your pride
