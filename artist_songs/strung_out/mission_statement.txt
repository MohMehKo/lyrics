I believe you earn your soul
Gotta feel the pain and grow
Our best intentions blowin' in the wind
I got trouble on my mind
You've got a little on your mind
We both ain't runnin' but we don't belong

I still believe in the changes
I still believe in the sound
Of all voice is screaming out
We are forever bound (forever bound)

I still believe in all that we can do
When the valley gets too dark
We'll lead each other to the mark cause
I still believe

I heard a word: Sincerity
You've got your then sing with me
We are the change that we've been screamin' for
Who's gonna help us now
Who's gonna show us how
We got our story now
Lets write our song

I still believe we can make this
There's something bigger than what breaks us
All voices screaming now
So now don't let me down
Forever bound

I still believe in the song of the underdog
In the bottom of the heart along the railroad tracks
I still believe

I got the world on my mind
Do I have you by my side?
There's more to this than meets the eye
There's more to life then we can buy

Forever bound
I still believe in all that we can do
When the valley gets too dark
We'll lead each other to the mark cause
I still believe
That we still got a chance

Along this lonely road
We're never who we say we are
I heard the word
I feel the change
And I see something in the way
