We're farther than we've ever been

In dreams I navigate to the space inside my heart
Where I find grace among these souls that only live to hate
So lost and on the run
Headed for a light that we all see
Beyond the ragged framework of our loneliest skies
We're all lost and on the run
Tending fires that we made that we lost control of
So these black maps will lead me on my way tonight
Through valleys hidden in between the darkness of your eyes
Pythagorean skies to lay claim philosophize
A shadow on your face as you completely lose your mind
It seems this path
Has led me straight to you

I believe there's a place where you and me can find our way
Here we go to hell and back hold sway
It's a place we never let 'em see
A place designed for you and me
X marks the spot you'll always know exactly where to find me

It's deeper than our hearts allow 
Deeper than the sea we drowned
A shadow on your face as you completely lose your mind
Through valleys hidden in between the darkness of your eyes

We're farther than we've ever been before
The terrain here is desert dry
And the drugs you find won't get you high
Here the sum of the hole
Is deeper than the hearts it stole

I believe there's a place where you and me can find our way
Here we go to hell and back hold sway
It's a place we never let 'em see
A place designed for you and me
X marks the spot you'll always know exactly where to find me

We're all lost
And on the run, tending fires that we make
We're all lost
Can't get control of the fires that we make
