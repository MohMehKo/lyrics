Slipping in and out of reason
and I don't mind
Side effects are expected
with this experiment of mine
I wanna be reborn
breath smoke
think black and call it a night
A temporary eclipse outshines me for a moment
I see no end in sight now

And still I wait
for this stranger inside of me
to show himself and let me be

Slowly I increase the dosage
one more try and I'll get it right now
Feel my head expanding outward
I've arrived at a place
I haven't been before yeah

Something in the atmosphere
is speaking what I wanna hear
The walls have started breathing
the colors I am seeing
The sign ahead reads welcome neighbor
give up all your fears and enter
step on through no hesitation

No disguises
my eyes are wide open
and I can see for the first time
How did we get this far down
How do I find my way back
from this head I've let unkoil

No disguises
