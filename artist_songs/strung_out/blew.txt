I paint myself a window 
In this world of your conception 
Where it all comes down to you 
You knew if you conceived it 
You knew I would believe it 
You knew that you would paint me into your world of blue 

I got a one track mind
Cant get you out of my mind

You call it something to say 
You call it nothing to lose 
You call it anything but the truth 
Suffocation in words 
Your isolation disturbs 
I can hear your voice as it echoes on 

So bury over and over 
The songs you sing inside my head 
I don't wanna lose 
What you left inside of me cause it's all I own of you 

The red disguises 
Secrets lies 
And the blue belongs to you 
Alone the gold 
Is time wasted 
In lines of indecision dragging onward 

So bury over and over 
The light in you that won't stay dead 
I don't wanna lose 
What you left inside of me 
Cause it's something real 
Pulling me under 

I hear the warm hum of your voice washing over me 
A blue light melody of sound 
Shines across my back and now 
Its pulling me down 
Pulling me under to where hide yourself alone 
Gagged and tied to the weight of ourselves 

Underwater... 
Well I won't forget this loss 
The shame of regret turn 
Out the lights and sit in 
Darkness while I try to make it through 

Silence! 
There's a monster growing strong 
Silence!
Conspire to bring me down 
Silence!
I wont forget this life
Silence!
Its all I own of you

This is the beginning, this is the
beginning of the rest of the future now and from now on
there will simply be all these robots walking around, feeling
nothing, thinking nothing, and there will be nobody left almost
to remind them that there once a species called a human
being, with feelings and thoughts and that history and
memory are right now being erased and soon nobody will
really remember that life existed on the planet.
