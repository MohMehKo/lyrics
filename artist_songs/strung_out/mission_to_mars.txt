Countdown initiation 
sequence the course is set 
all systems functioning in check 
all preparations have been met 
brain function at full engagement 
body locked in vigilance 
awaiting contact with a destination far inside of me 
sling shot across the sky 
a million light years to the other side 
reality's a distant hazy dream 
exiting the atmosphere of my mind body and chemistry 
my body separates itself from me 
approaching our destination 
heart and mind have reached ascension 
no response to signal sent 
we are unable to respond to the remaining threat
crews incapacitated vital signs have clearly stated 
something's gone wrong with the ship
collision course is imminent slingshot across the sky
a million light years to the other side 
no one could have imagined anything like this
ascending to another state can't stop and think 
or hesitate the reality of the situation has reached control.
