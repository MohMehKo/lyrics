This engines revving
And the tires are burning
The smell of asphalt lingers in the air
My head is spinning 
And my thoughts are burning
The ground is shaking with every stare

Tell me where just tell me how
Tell me where I'm supposed to go
A thousand miles down this one way street
Where it stops I don't know

Hallucinations feeding desecrations
Never bargained for a ride like this
Lying disgrace has locked me up
My fate down and out but not alone

So

Tell me where just tell me how
Tell me where I'm supposed to go
A thousand miles down this one way street
Where it stops I don't know

[Spoken:]
A one way trip to the center of my spine
To the desert I call my mind
And in my rearview I'm watched by the same set of burning eyes
Will you assure me I'm home-free?
So I shift into neutral and I let it ride

I've dug my grave and locked my door
No prayers gonna save me now
This machines superficial fate just awaits
I've lost all control of my world

Tell me where just tell me how
Tell me where I'm supposed to go
A thousand miles down this one way street
Where it stops I don't know

Bridge of ASHES

Burn all the things that you feel inside
You gotta watch your fucking war cause your gonna die
Burn all the things that are slipping away
And watch the fall of society
Ash to ashes dust to dust
Outside the temple where we used to burn
Burn all the things that are slipping away
Burn everything thats fucking up society
Burn all the dreams that you keep inside
Ya burn them all back to the ground.
