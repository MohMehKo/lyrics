You gave in to your vice so quickly. 
Now I die alone among these people I don't know. 
And faces I've not seen - your masquerade it made me blind 
Well now I see what I must do. don't know where I must go, 
To run from tonight. we're gonna drag each other down again, 
Gonna bring each other down. to make believe made it alright, 
To turn our heads the other way 
Made it seem like we could try to hide from all. 
Well I'm sorry and I know 
This hole we dig for ourselves will bury everything we feel, 
Then bury us tonight. we're gonna drag each other down again,
Gonna bring each other down. I cannot ignore, 
I cannot deny, I cannot feel at all, I cannot hide - 
Just another day, just another war, 
Just another time I must kill another part of me.
