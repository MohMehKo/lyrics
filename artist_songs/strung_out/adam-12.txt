[?] by the police local papers call this justice I call it murder [?] with a club in his hand [?] I watched you beat my friend to the ground let you get away without a sound intimidation is won with the weapons you possess you walk the streets a soldier with the masses you oppress if your a public servant then who the fuck are you listening to preach [?] but there's a point that can't get through to you badges, your mind, the shield you all hind behind courage [?] our lives, our live kiss them goodbye no longer a servant of mine our lives, our lives kiss them goodbye no longer [?] you beat and you kick us we can never run away nothing gonna stop me know until I've had my say [?] the 12 gauge I'm just getting started I can't begin to express my rage [?] and that means nothing
[chorus]
