As above then so below we celebrate the wounds that make us whole 
connect the dots, divide the truth, profit from the beasts complexity 
new terror new stage new end new race new face economy 
program a president the model of the manufactured proof 
How did we get to be so hated gather 'round the tube and wonder why 
economy, spirituality, together are void of harmony 
create a god and brush the skin with the oil of a bleedin' tanker ship 
life's just a matter of who is willing to deliver the blow that'll strike you down 
Chrysanthemums and steely atom bombs arise! And shape the landscape of my heart 
and mind...Destruction to this hurting world 
How do you want to be judged in the face of your complacency 
I already know my times runnin out 
So ...burn the flag of every nation state, flood the palaces with the peoples hate 
and all will be one.
