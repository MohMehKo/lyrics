Well I feel stupid writing this
Cause it's almost like I'm getting ready
For something I'm not ready for
I guess I just wanna let you know
Wish I could be face to face with you
And tell you how I feel

I wasn't gonna write this, you see
My buddy and I had a deal
I just hope and pray that
Neither one of us has to deliver
As it comes down to it

I will always be with you
I will always be watching
I miss you all
Tell my girl that I love her
I'll be dreaming of her

And I don't wanna fight anymore
And I'm still not sure what I'm doing here
I'm praying and praying, who are we praying to
That might understand
And if you get this letter I'm sorry I didn't make it back

I will always be with you
Always watching
And now I know that I'll never die alone
No matter where I am

Hold on, please don't forget me when I'm gone
Cause I forgot why I ever left at all
These times take the best of them
And leave nothing for the rest of them
And I judge myself in every way
And I can no longer look at myself in the same way

And I don't wanna be a coward
But does any of this mean a thing
The sacrifice, whose sacrifice

I will always be with you
I will always be watching
And now I know that I'll never die alone
No matter where I am
Hold on please don't forget me when I'm gone
Cause I forgot why I ever left at all
Why I ever left at all
Why I ever left at all
I just had to let you know
