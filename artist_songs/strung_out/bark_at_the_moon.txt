Screams break the silence 
Waking from the dead of night 
Vengeance is boiling 
He's Returned to kill the light 
Then when he's found what he's looking for 
Listen in awe and you'll hear him 

Ha Ha Ha Ha 

Years spent in torment 
Buried in a nameless grave 
Now he has risen 
Miracles would have to save 
Those that the beast is looking for 
Listen in awe and you'll hear him 

Bark at the moon! 

They cursed and buried him 
Along with shame 
And thought his timeless soul had gone 
In empty burning hell - Unholy One 
But he's returned to prove them wrong, So wrong 
Oh, Yeah Baby! 

Howling In shadows 
Living in a lunar spell 
He finds his heaven 
Spewing from the mouth of hell 

Then what he's found what he's looking for 
Listen in awe and you'll hear him 

Bark at the moon! 

oh, Yeah Bark at the moon! 
woah, Yeah Bark at the moon! 
woah, oh oh yeah Bark at the moon! 

[Howl]
