There are those that I took everything
There are those that I gave everything I had
We don't wanna die in vain
We don't wanna live in chains
Screaming till the end of days
For the madness of this love

Does anybody know what they want
Has everybody gone insane
When all the lonely places we haunt
Echo everything we want
We're just borrowing what we can't own

So show yourself
All the pretty things they sell us out
So bury me deep in the hole that I bought
Suck me off and make me real
Plug me in and do what you feel
A metaphor for letting go
To show yourself there's something more

Does anybody know what they want
Has everybody got what they deserve
When all the lonely places we haunt
Echo everything we want
We're just borrowing what we can't own
So show yourself there's nothing more

As it washes over me in silent grace trajectory
Am I a prisoner because I choose to be?
Does anybody know what they want
When everything is made to break 
Is anybody really there 
When all the world is mine to take
When all the lonely places we haunt
Echo everything we want
We're just borrowing what we can't own
So show yourself

Am I a prisoner cuz I choose to be?
Raise you up to where you belong
Nobody ever stays around too long to get it right
When all the world is mine to take
And everything is made to break
