Here I am today it seems I'm stoned once again 
Wait for the people and things that ruin my day 
As I sit away and take another hit I smoke another bong 
Load and it seems I'm really lit 
Talk about the things that no one ever wants to hear 
Talk about the things in life that seem so unreal as I sit away 
And take another hit I smoke another bong load 
And it seems I'm really lit hey I can't take no more of it, 
Now I'm stoned. these highs never last so I can never hear the phone 
Rather sit here and think about these things here all alone as I sit away, 
I take another hit, I smoke another bong load 
And it seems I'm really lit hey I can't take no more of it, 
Now I'm stoned. now life is so cold once again, now I'm stoned. 
So stoned. woowowow.
