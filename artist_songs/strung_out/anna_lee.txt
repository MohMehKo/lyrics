You hold this place inside my head you're a symphony of hurt
The daylight passes through me To another crippled verse 
Been here once before and I know exactly where it ends;
Right back where we started pain dead flowers on the bed
Anna Lee don't you cry for me 
You're not as strong as you wanna be 
In the dark we all see what we know 
It's the space that scares us so 
You lead me to your garden where only dead things dare to grow
You convince me I deserve the thorn you've tried so hard to show 
Normalness escapes me to the point of no return 
The memories around this place keep us from movin' on
Anna Lee don't you cry for me 
You're not as strong as you wanna be 
In the dark we all see what we know 
Its the space that scares us so The endless balmy air we breathe 
This city's startin' to get to me tonight 
I'll take the metro anywhere that isn't here 
I find the comfort in the pain I always cause...all night 
She says she might wait around for me 
To come along with a promise and a dream
