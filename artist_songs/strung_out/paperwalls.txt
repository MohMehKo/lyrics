A look of discontentment fills your hazel eyes
As I ask for the millionth time what's going on
You seem to be confused about just where you stand with me tonight
As we tear apart all that wasn't lost to another fight

And so we turn against each other once again
You run and I go hide
Talking to myself again about all the things I should've said
And I wait for you

I sit and wait for you

I wanna know where this is going and do we
Still have a chance to save what we haven't lost again?
I made a promise to myself not to let this go
But now I need to see this through to burn these paper walls of doubt

And so we turn against each other once again
You run and I go hide
Talking to myself again about all the things I should've said
And I wait for you

I sit and wait for you

My fucked-up head is spinning 'round and all my thoughts just keep me down
Here on your doorstep, I'm drunk again
I know you're sick of all my shit and I know you want an end of this
So tell me right now, where do you stand?

I know you're tired of this waiting game and I know you're tired of all my ways
I know you're tired of it all; just tell me now

I wanna know where this is going and do we
Still have a chance to save what we haven't lost inside?
All these paperwalls we build and all the ashes that have spilled
Get in the way, get in the way

And so we turn against each other once again
You run and I go hide
Talking to myself again about all the things I should've said
And I wait for you

I sit and wait for you
