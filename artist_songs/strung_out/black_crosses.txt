Vapour trails chase down the setting sun
And the silence comes in dreams of everyone.
Hieroglyphic prophecy in digital display,
Racing to the end of time, we don't really wanna know the way.

Illumination, my divine right.
I'm separation of earth and state.

Black crosses in the sun, waiting for us
Down lonely horizons.
We're wasting away, we're down on our knees,
Awaiting prophecy from someone else's dreams.

Empty eyes stare through the blackened sun.
We can rise only to become undone.
One thousand fathoms deep below the darkest ocean depths
To radiated heavens floating just beyond our reach.

We are the light that fuels the sun,
To burn no more and cave in on us.

Black crosses in the sun, waiting for us
Down lonely horizons.
We're wasting away, we're down on our knees,
Awaiting prophecy from someone else's dreams.

I hear the rapture now.
We are dead space in time.
The signal's coming in and out.
We are the lonely ones.

We are the lonely ones.

Black crosses in the sun, waiting for us
Down lonely horizons.
Black crosses in the sun, we're wasting away,
Down lonely horizons.

Black crosses in the sun, waiting for us,
Awaiting prophecy from someone else's dreams.

We're wasting away, we're down on our knees.
