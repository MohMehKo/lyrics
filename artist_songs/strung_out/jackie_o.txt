A warm Dallas breeze floats naked through the air 
As a million hungry faces watch the king 
And his parade on show for the world to see 
Prime time America nineteen sixty three 
And you were by his side 
I still remember pictures, that look on your face 
The king had been forsaken and his country died 
In three seconds that would last an eternity 

O Jackie-O
I wonder what you could be thinking 
Now your mixed up little head has been left alone 
In a world so cold 
Just a foot note in history book full of lies 

You're such a good girl 
Keep smiling make 'em happy 
All is well in the land of make believe 
As soon as the bullet left the chamber 
On that calm November day 
You knew the world would never be the same 
The killer in us all 
Just victims of ourselves looking for the perfect death 
Trigger happy patriots running from ourselves 
You knew it would never be the same again 

O Jackie-O I wonder what you're thinking
Now you've been left here all on your own 
In this land a world of make believe 
You get back what was taken from you and go moving on

O Jackie-O
I wonder what you could be thinking 
Now your mixed up little head has been left alone 
In a world so cold 
Just a foot note in history book full of lies
