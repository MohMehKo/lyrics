I'll understand if you're not feeling well enough to write
I'll understand if you've got way too many things to do
you see I've been sitting here for an hour trying to finish what I started
Now it seems every line gets harder and never really write out what I wanna say
So I hope this letter finds you well
It's taken me a little while to sit and spell out everything I wanna say
But I think I'm ready to convey
You're the reason that I play at all
You got me thinking how a song can change it all
If there's any wonder how I made it through
Well I tell them that's between me and you, well
Someday I'll thank you if I see you around
But for now I'll just keep this letter to myself
And a song I'll probably never sing for you
Like a satellite
Spinning 'round my head in sound
When you're sixteen and you're full of pain
Yeah nothing matters much but the sound of broken bottles and hearts
And the ties that bind you to what you can't ignore
In a world where I had no control I used my voice as a weapon that I could own
I screamed and shouted until I bled
I meant every single word I said
You're the reason that I care at all
You got me thinking how a song can change it all
If there's anyone that I want to hear
Well nothing's ever been so clear
Someday I'll thank you if I see you around
But for now I'll just keep this letter to myself
And a song I'll probably never sing for you
Like a satellite
Spinning 'round my head in sound
Like a song I won't forget
Oh satellite spinning 'round my head
Like a song I won't forget
When we're all grown up and looking for that anger nothing matters much
But the reassuring sound of your voice buzzing through the stereo
All this imagery and sound
With words that bite and tear out
So watch me find myself
Again now I found my voice again now.
