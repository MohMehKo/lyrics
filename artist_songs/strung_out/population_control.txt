I kneel to you when you preach to me 
you're my god you're my TV 
you control what I say you control what I hear 
you control what the fuck 
My whole existence revolves around this cable to my mind.
it's thought parole, population control 
it's slavery of mankind. 

Under their control! 
You're loving their control! 

Oooo

Don't question the forces that govern your miserable life.
don't seek out the answers that void your empty life. 
cause this melancholy vision is just a brief episode 
in this game called reality. 
It's something I've been trying so hard to figure out.
