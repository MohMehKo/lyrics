Silent in the dark
Waiting for the spark
The wood soaked in their blood
Their hands joined in the mud
The ember gently glowed
The spark took to their clothes
The flames kept on rising higher

They stood in the fire
They burn with desire
With love and emotion
They dance with devotion
They stood in the fire
They burn with desire
With love and emotion
They dance with devotion
They stood in the fi-
Stood in the fi-
(Love and-)

Tighter than before
They still want something more
The heat dries out the skin
As their patience grows thinner
Thinner than before
Cause they want even more
Cause they share in this fire

They stood in the fire
They burn with desire
With love and emotion
They dance with devotion
They stood in the fire
They burn with desire
With love and emotion
They dance with devotion
They stood in the fire
They burn with desire
With love and emotion
They dance with devotion

They stood in the fire
They burn with desire
With love and emotion
They dance with devotion
They stood in the fi-
Stood in the fi-
(Love and-)
