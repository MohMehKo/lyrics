We don't care what they say
We will be here all day
We'll stay here till it's over

Till the world's out of sight
We will stand, we will fight
It's not over till it's over

As I fell to the ocean floor
Fading light through an open door
Saw myself rise with the water

They thought they could keep me down
Hold their breath and watch me drown
But all they did has pushed me higher

We don't care what they say
We will be here all day
We will stay till it's over

Till the world's out of sight
We will stand, we will fight
It's not over till it's over

Through the nights in the rain
Through the time and the pain
We'll stand, we'll never fall

And then at the end of it all
We will win, we will chant
It's not over till it's over
