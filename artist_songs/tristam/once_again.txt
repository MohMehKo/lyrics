As the sun steps down and escapes the day
We'll calmly walk away, walk away from the fray
When the structure falls and all else fails
We will build it once again

When the colors fade and it turns to gray
We'll calmly walk away, walk away from the fray
When the structure falls and all else fails
We will build it once again
We can climb high, higher than before
We could stand by while it burns to the floor
Though we cannot fly
We will build and the wounds will mend
As we build it once again

And we can climb high, higher than before
We could stand by while it burns through the floor
We can not fly
We will build and the wounds will mend
As we build it once again [x2]
