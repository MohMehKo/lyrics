Look up, there's a world in front of you
A million roads yet you still wonder what to do
You must find that thrive, that love, that thrill
Cause in your eyes you're the king of your world
Look down theres a pencil at your feet
You're the only single person in control
Of your life, of your reality
Cause in my eyes we are the kings of our worlds
