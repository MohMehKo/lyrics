You want me to be someone else
You want me to change myself so you can live
It won't happen again, again
You want me to live my life
Thinking that I can't achieve my best
Oh... well, talent goes by

Talent goes by. Talent goes by
Talent goes by. Talent goes by

Talent goes by. Talent goes by
Talent goes by. Talent goes by

Talent goes by. Talent goes by
Talent goes by. Talent goes by

You want me to be someone else
You want me to change myself so you can live
It won't happen again, again
You want me to live my life
Thinking that I can't achieve my best
Oh... well, talent goes by

Talent goes by. Talent goes by
Talent goes by. Talent goes by

Talent goes by. Talent goes by
Talent goes by. Talent goes by

Talent goes by. Talent goes by
Talent goes by. Talent goes by
