The truth
Is running in our blood
The answers
Are lying here within
The truth
Is running in our blood
The answers
Are lying here within
There is no secret
There is no mystery untold
The love in each of us
Is all we really need to know

I'll break away (break away)

I'll break away (break away)
I'll break away from the chains, from the pull

I'll break away (break away)

I'll break away (break away)
I'll break away from the chains, from the pull
The truth is running in our blood
The answers are lying here within
