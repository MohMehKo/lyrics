In the wind I hear my name
With the ones, starting the games
Call me now, cause I can barely breathe
I can feel you chanting lively
I can feel that music in me
We were born just to believe

And when it's all over
We can be together
Venture to the world inside
I could see you deeper
I could see you clearer
I'll never be afraid to die again
I'll always be there for you my friend

After all that we've been through
Will this light lead me to you
I can't stay here one more day
I swear to you I'm not afraid
Through the wind chimes, through the bells
I would carry you through hell

In the wind I hear my name
With the ones, starting the games
Call me now, cause I can barely breathe
I can feel you chanting lively
I can feel that music in me
We were born just to believe
