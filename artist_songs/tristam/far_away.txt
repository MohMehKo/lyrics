And all of your wind has gone
And all of the paths you've drawn
Have sunk to the ocean sand
Where no one can see you stand
Don't let the dark embrace
Cower the dreams you chase
Under the rust and blood
Don't let yourself
Give up

And all these steps
These steps that we take
Are leading us far away
And all these years are passing each day
Since then we are far away
From where we were
We did what we could
Were light years away
From where we stood
The road goes on
Far from it all

We will start from the start
We will start from the start
We will start from the start
We will start from the start
We will start from the start
We will start from the start
We will start from the start
