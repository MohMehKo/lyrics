Build an empire of sound
Of sound...

I'm left in nowhere
No place to hide
Out in the open
Like ashes in the sky
I quit the illusion
I'm moving on
I'm moving on

Build an empire of sound
As the bridges were falling down
In the midst of endless time
We've build along the side
Build an empire of sound
As the sun was calling down
Falling deeper in the stream
As we fail to find the scene
Build an empire of sound

Change is entering it's way through time
As we all walk in this dangerous line
And I am watching this world on fall
I'll stay, I'll doing just what they're told

I'm left in nowhere
No place to hide
Out in the open
Like ashes in the sky
I quit the illusion
I'm moving on

Build an empire of sound
As the bridges were falling down
In the midst of endless time
We've build along the side
Build an empire of sound
As the sun was calling down
Fallen deeper in the stream
As we fail to find the scene
Build an empire of sound

Build an empire of sound...
