As he watches through the door
His smile pulls in more and more
Wicked thoughts shape wicked ways
While we all crave, while we all crave
When the man yells at his son
When he finds the smoking gun
Don't you worry, little one
For we all crave, we all crave

Just ahead of time
Know your addiction’s not a crime
It's just a smaller part of who
You want to become in the end

When the snow is on her mind
Rows and rows and lines and lines
In the haze of your fixation
We all crave for you, we all crave
And you can kill the wildest thing
But when you murder, it's a sin
In the midst of your conviction
We all crave for you, we all crave

Just ahead of time
Know your addiction’s not a crime
It's just a smaller part of who
You want to become in the end
