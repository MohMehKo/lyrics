Down Hawkling Street where shadows wonder
They sweep the walls, they crawl and crawl, to kiss the lights
The woman wonders, "Where's the crowd?"
The clock reads night, yet she's still out
She peeves the dark and sees the blood
As she walks, they creep and crawl
(They creep and crawl.)
They creep and crawl
(Oh, they creep and crawl.)
They creep and crawl
(They creep and crawl in the dark.)
As she walks, they creep and...

They creep and crawl

They creep and crawl

(The woman wonders, "Where's the crowd?")
(The clock reads night, yet she's still out.)
(She peeves the dark) and sees the blood
As she walks, they creep and crawl. Crawl. Crawl
(They creep and crawl.)
They creep and crawl
(Oh, they creep and crawl.)
They creep and crawl. Crawl. Crawl
(Oh, they creep and crawl in the dark.)
As she walks, they creep and...they creep and crawl
They creep and crawl. They creep and crawl
As she walks, they creep and crawl
They creep and crawl. They creep and crawl. (In the da-)
In the dark they creep and crawl

They creep and crawl. They creep and crawl. They creep and crawl. (In the da-)
As she walks, they creep and crawl
They creep and crawl. They creep and crawl. (In the da-)
In the dark they creep and crawl
They creep and crawl. They creep and crawl. (In the da-)
They creep and crawl. They creep and crawl
They creep and crawl. They creep and crawl
(In the dark)
