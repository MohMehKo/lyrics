I already got my hands, my head, my feet
Now all I need, is someone sweet
Someone so kind, someone in love
With life, and all of the above
Don't need to mention any names
But what is clear I'd take the blame
Don't get me started on your will
The one you wear, every single day
You never ask, try so hard
I'm so amazed, what can I say
You clearly let it show
You clearly let it show
Don't get me started on your will
The one you wear, every single day
You never ask, try so hard
I'm so amazed, what can I say
You clearly let it show
