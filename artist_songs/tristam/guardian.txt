Oh oh oh
Why can't you see?
Got a guardian watching over me

Oh oh oh
Why can't you see?
Got a guardian watching over me

Oh oh oh
Why can't you see?
Got a guardian watching over me

Oh oh oh
Why can't you see?
Got a guardian watching over me

Oh oh oh
Why can't you see?
Got a guardian watching over me

Oh oh oh
Why can't you see?
Got a guardian watching over me

How I can explain
The fear
No longer anyone calls my name
I dont know where to go, I don know what to see
Everyone surrounds me, I dont know who it be
Down down down down down
My life is going round round round round round

Oh oh oh
Why can't you see?
Got a guardian watching over me

Oh oh oh
Why can't you see?
Got a guardian watching over me

Watching over me...
