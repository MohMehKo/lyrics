You're tossing and turning
You think you're awake while you're trying to run
Like in a nightmare
Time loves your ego to death
You're leaving the wheelwork to the ground of being
You go on
Defying temptation in the engine room that is ourself

I feel a storm is looming with a shaking grumble
I don't know if I'm right or wrong
I don't know if I shall go on
I don't know what I'll believe but I'm on my way

Minds fly free when the gates fly open
Walk on through thunder and rain and the wind in my face
Ghostlights dance will you heed the token
Glazing light blinding my eyes get me out of this maze

The world as we know it is beginning to shake
I don't trust my eyes are we all superstitious
If we think what our hearts know is true
Fireworks surround me
wherever I go they tell me: always home
psycho-somatic they'll name it the nature of god

Off to a new horizon
Time is the key to unite with the all
Time is gonna make you see right from wrong eternally
Don't let the noises devour you

Minds fly free when the gates fly open
Walk on through thunder and rain and the wind in my face
Ghostlights dance will you heed the token
Glazing light blinding my eyes get me out of this maze

And what if you're only a prism for the ghostlights that you wanna see
And we're just reflections of your dreams
It's speaking to me
It's yelling at me
It's screaming to me, resonating with me
And a thousand lights are trying to make me see
They call me home

Minds fly free when the gates fly open
Walk on through thunder and rain and the wind in my face
Ghostlights dance will you heed the token
Glazing light blinding my eyes get me out of this maze
