[Temptation:]
Eternities ago I must have fallen
Through my pride
Been perfect in my ways
The morning star they fired from heaven
Envy wrapped into a gown of grace

[Aaron:]
I hear the screams that echo from the darkness
I swerve from dawn to dusk and off the edge

[Temptation:]
Hear the creature crying in the distance
Buried in a symbol on a shelf

I'll take you home tonight
To the center of your soul
I'll take you home tonight
Fire and flesh and blood

[Both:]
Touching the flames tonight
Touching the flames tonight

[Aaron:]
Morning star embrace me on these grounds
Angel of light

[Temptation:]
How will I forgive Him who wouldn't
Forgive me who just valued the power
How shall I live in peace with the one
Outshining me and then have me devoured

[Aaron:]
I'm feeling alive under these skies
Bloodshot's the moon and scarlet's the night

[Temptation:]
I'll make you fume with fury and rage
I'll make you see
What you're made of tonight

I'll take you home tonight
To the center of your soul
I'll take you home tonight
Fire and flesh and blood

[Both:]
Touching the flames tonight
Touching the flames tonight
Touching the flames tonight

[Temptation:]
Touching the flames tonight
