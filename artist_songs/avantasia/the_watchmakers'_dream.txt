Welcome to the aftermath of the incidence
That made the tower fall
Another screw to another wheel
For another mind won't stray anymore
Oh won't stray away from its brain
Oh noâ€¦

We must finalise the giant
To level off the void and zeroise the will
The time will come: you will know what you need
The Watchmakers' Dream
The Watchmakers' Dream

Simplify simplicity
You don't mind what you don't see at all

The tongue of nations brought the line
Reason occupied: the God-machine oh
A splendid steaming dream will tower to the sky

We'll exploit another 'morrow
We drained another day
The glowing of the future in our eyes
And time will reveal what we need:

The Watchmakers' Dream
The Watchmakers' Dream

We must finalise the giant
To zeroise the will and level off all minds
The time will come that you
Will know what you need

The Watchmakers' Dream
The Watchmakers' Dream

The Watchmakers' Dream - Will we slice infinity
The Watchmakers' Dream - For all the world to see
The Watchmakers' Dream - We give you what you need
The Watchmakers' Dream - The sound of triviality
