[Ronnie:] 
You see the sun touch the horizon
You know the future awaits
And yours hides in the darkness
[Tobias:] 
The stars are gonna line up in the night sky
I see what some will deny
As I follow the starkness
[Jorn:] 
Can you believe your eyes
We'll make you rise to the occasion
Follow your heart and run
Seek shelter from the day

[Michael:] 
Waiting for the moon
The sound of falling angels calling you
Strange and magic
Hear us call your name

[Robert:] 
Darkness shines a sweet
deceleration down on you
[Jorn:] 
Wayward child wake up to the moon

[Ronnie:] 
They wanna squeeze you in their picture from the outside
they call your life a world of make-believe
[Michael:] 
You're feeling pushed by a racing heartbeat
Parameterizing the world
They only see what they're told to see
[Jorn:] 
Child of the ocean floor
No need of daylight that deceives you
Don't let them wear you down
Listen to the voice

[Tobias:] 
Waiting for the moon
The sound of falling angels calling you
[Jorn:] 
Strange and magic
Hear us call your name

[Ronnie:] 
Darkness shines a sweet
deceleration down on you
Wayward child wake up to the moon

[Bob:] 
Kind of buried alive
You've been sacrificed
They show you the key
Till you love to agree
A brave modern day
This world is insane

[Robert:] 
Waiting for the moon
The sound of falling angels calling you
Strange and magic

[All:] 
Hear us call your name
Darkness shines a sweet
deceleration down on you
Wayward child wake up to the moon
Waiting for the moon
The sound of falling angels calling you
Strange and magic
Hear us call your name
Darkness shines a sweet
deceleration down on you
Wayward child wake up to the moon
