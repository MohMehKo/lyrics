[Tobias Sammet:]
Another star has fallen without sound
Another spark has burned out in the cold
Another door to barrens standing open
And who is there to tell me not to give in, not to go?

[Chorus:]
How could I know, how could I know?
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever
How could I know, how could I see?
Feeling like lost in space to roam forever

I'm crawling down, the doorway to the badlands
And kicking down are you heard: it's to the black
And all the damage fading in the rear view mirror
And the demons are calling me, they're dragging me away

[Chorus]

[Amanda Somerville:]
Lost in space, lost in time
Lost in space, lost in time
Lost in space

[Tobias Sammet:]
How could I know - How could I
How could I know - How could I know
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever
How could I know - How could I see
Feeling like lost in space to roam forever

Forever...
