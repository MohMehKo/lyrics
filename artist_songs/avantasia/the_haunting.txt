I can't count the days I've days I've roamed
A stray ghost liked to wither on the vine
A paling tales of days long gone
I won't be untill you close your eyes

Sleep time
Someone's always by your side

A thousand nights we've been calling your name
Close your eyes but I won't go away
We're there for you
The cold embrace that you don't want to feel
Must not be but you know it is real
We're there for you

Don't you waste your time and try
To understand this figment of the lie

Don't breathe the word to anyone
By the time you phrase me I'll be gone

Sweet dreams
See you in the twilight zone

A thousand nights we've been calling your name
Close your eyes but I won't go away
We're there for you
The cold embrace that you don't want to feel
Must not be but you know it is real
We're there for you

Down I must contain the wayward fantasy
Where did all those wicked dreams come from
Pictures in the dark they seem so eerily
Winter night, I pray my mind is wrong

I'm the spot they refuse to conceive

A thousand nights we've been calling your name
Close your eyes but I won't go away
We're there for you
The cold embrace that you don't want to feel
Must not be but you know it is real
We're there for you
