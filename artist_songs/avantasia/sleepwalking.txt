Wandering (before)
into nowhere
just another winter's night
and I don't feel gravity anymore

You never lie
never cry
never talk beyond of dreams
and the dream is what remains

Tell me don't you see what ain't there 
when you look into the mirror 
you're stumbling away
like a candle burning down

Miles away, miles away 
You've been cutting of the rope
Letting go I'm losing ground

And I wonder who's to blame
As I sleepwalk in the rain
It's now
Victory over gravity
And I sleepwalk in the rain

Winter sky, far and white
Caving in on you and me
Like the (bridle) wall, the emerald room
The hall of fame and dying dreams

The love we've tried for, petrified
I wanna know, does the frozen river flow?

And I wonder who's to blame
As I sleepwalk in the rain
It's now
Victory over gravity
And I sleepwalk in the rain

And I wonder who's to blame
As I sleepwalk in the rain
It's 
Victory over gravity
And I sleepwalk in the rain

I
As I
