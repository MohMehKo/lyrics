There's a time when nothing matters
from the sentimal violence.
An event that ends in tatters,
flying to a whole new height.

We wanna see the whole room jump up, jump up.
We wanna see the room erupt.

Because we worked all week,
worked all week.
You know we worked all week,
worked all week.
And then we light the fuse,
and then just let us go.

Saturday, we go crazy,
you and me go crazy.
Saturday, we go crazy, we go crazy and
fight like, like no other day [x3]
Fight set up for Saturday night.
We go crazy (crazy, crazy).
We go crazy (crazy, crazy).

On your massive set we're ready.
On the dark your disco finds.
There's a thousand different motives,
and the demons they ignite.

We wanna see the whole room jump up, jump up.
We wanna see the room erupt.

Because we worked all week,
worked all week.
You know we worked all week,
worked all week.
And then we light the fuse,
and then just let us go.

Saturday, we go crazy,
you and me go crazy.
Saturday, we go crazy, we go crazy and
fight like, like no other day [x3]
Fight set up for Saturday night.
We go crazy (crazy, crazy).
We go crazy (crazy, crazy).

Because we worked all week,
worked all week.
You know we worked all week,
worked all week.
And then we light the fuse,
and then just let us go.

Saturday, [x3]
we go crazy,
you and me go crazy.
Saturday,
we go crazy,
we go crazy and
fight like, like no other day [x3]
Fight set up for Saturday night.
