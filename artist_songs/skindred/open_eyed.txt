I know that you are running. [x4]

I've gotta make it different, gotta make it loud.

We are the sickness, we are the ill.
We are the worms that you shoot to kill.
We are the hated, we are the birds.
We are the worms that come out of the dead.

They try to make us follow, make us fail.
A hundred million winds won't make us sway.
They try to make us follow, make us fail.
We are the ones who won't take no more.

I know that you are running. [x4]

We are open eyed. You stay mystified and your number's fading.
We are open eyed. You stay mystified cause I doubt we'll take it, take it, take it.. cause I doubt we'll take it.

We are the hopeless, we are the poor.
We are the scum that you move from your door.
We are the wasted, we are the worst.
We are the ones that they think are cursed.

They try to make us follow, make us fail.
A hundred million winds won't make us sway.
They try to make us follow, make us fail.
We are the ones who won't take no more.

I know that you are running. [x4]

We are open eyed. You stay mystified and your number's fading.
We are open eyed. You stay mystified cause I doubt we'll take it, take it, take it.. cause I doubt we'll take it.

I know that you are running. [x4]

We are the open eyed. [x4]

We are open eyed. You stay mystified and your number's fading.
We are open eyed. You stay mystified cause I doubt we'll take it, take it, take it.. cause I doubt we'll take it.

We are open eyed.
