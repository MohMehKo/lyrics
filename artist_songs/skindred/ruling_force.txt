Encourage one another, together we'll be stronger.
Get you the hurts and you will reach the heights. 
Every day we fight this battle. Stay strong, no cease, no settle. 
In a time like this we got to stand up and unite. 
Focus nearly for the protecting, raising this to a whole new height.
And no matter what they say, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna make it. 
And no matter what they do, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna take it.
No tribal checks I make cause I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna break it.

We'll make it now or never, 
as one that stayed together. 
As what's been left forevermore, 
forevermore, forever.

We got the ruling, ruling force. [x6]

This mind is over matter, stand up, one day we scatter. 
Chase your enemies are gonna disappear. 
And no matter what they say, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna make it. 
Can't put no chains on me, cause we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna make it.

We'll make it now or never, 
as one that stayed together. 
As what's been left forevermore, 
forevermore, forever. [x2]

We got the ruling, ruling force. [x6]
