Man we're living in a dangerous time
Every nation to the father seeks a sign
You're either righteous or the heathen infidel
It's only judgment morning every tongue will tell
Rumors rumors everywhere
Times like this when people care
We got to stand up deal with this fight
We cannot stop till this world is right
To the sky for your deliverance draws near
Bringing the force of love to make hate disappear
Yer, I know we'll be together, yes I know we love each other
Yer, I know we'll be together, yes I know we love each other
Hold your corner strength and faith
Teach the youth to stand up in their face
Put your armour on each day
Watch your back and what you say yea
Stuck in the middle of the armageddeon
So much fear and contention
Now it's time to shine your light
Hope and pray that we can unite
To the sky for your deliverance draws near
Bring the force of love to make hate disappear
Yer, I know we'll be together, yes I know we love each other
Yer, I know we'll be together, yes I know we love each other
To the sky for your deliverance draws near
Bringing the force of love to make hate disappear
Yer, I know we'll be together, yes I know we love each other
Yer, I know we'll be together, yes I know we love each other
Yer, I know we'll be together, (Yer, I know we'll be together)
Yer, I know we'll be together, (Yer, I know we'll be together)
Yer, I know we'll be together, (Yer, I know we'll be together)
Yer, I know we'll be together, (Yer, I know we'll be together)
