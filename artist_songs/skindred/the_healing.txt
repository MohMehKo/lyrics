In addy ghetto where the shots dem bust off
Yoots dem duss off jump in addy car and dem just take off
Beg we no beg from we hungry we thirsty
Done a man life and we nah show no mercy

But thats the way the yoots they are going on every day now
They will blow you away and if you asked dem wha gwan dem have nothing say

Everyday these tribulation revelations
Every day we feel it all, read it all
Now every day ah revelation
Whether Brixton, Bradford or Birmingham
You know we need a solution
And I know

Nuff ah dem no put down the knife
Nuff ah dem der yoot deh they don't live long life
Dem no live long life
We see it every day
Hussle dem ah hussle like dem lose dem sight
Is like dem lose dem way

But thats the way the yoots they are going on every day now
They will blow you away and if you asked dem wha gwan dem have nothing say

Everyday these tribulation revelations
Every day we feel it all, read it all
Now every day ah revelation
Whether Brixton, Bradford or Birmingham
You know we need a solution
And I know

Start thinking now
Unity man dat run the place
Start thinking now
Raise your fist cuz you're born to win
Start thinking now
We don't care bout the colour of your skin
Start thinking now
At the start that's where we begin

Well every day ah tribulation
Whether Brixton, Bradford or Birmingham
We need a solution
And I know

Well every day ah tribulation
Whether Brixton, Bradford or Birmingham
We need a solution
And I know
