Roots rock, riot! Roots rock

So much blood spilt pon de dance floor
Just like Oliver Twist you know you're begging for more
Raw to the maximum broke down the law
Sweat and claret increase ya for sure

Ah we no want no badness bout ya
And everyone push up your lighter
Let me see you bouncing in the area
Call the police we come to murder

And so the music flows everybody knows

Musical murder in the room tonight
You know we're bouncing everyone hold tight
We keep you moving from the wrong to right
Roots rock riot

Can't find no room you know you can't find space
The energy's ecstatic as you're smashing up the place
You'll fall down if you can't take the pace
