Nuff of the yoots in the ghetto firing shots now everyday
Fighting against the ways of Jah, Jah know dem feel no way
If you carry on so then there is a price to pay
Life inside a cell is not a place you wanner stay

Nuff youth dem come from good families, families
Too much ah dem dem just ah end up in a cemetery, they're history
Influenced by the badness that them see, Wha dem ah see
Coz there's a lesson to be learn and you just don't have to be, a memory

What you're dealing with you know that that ain't right
The way you carry on the way you love to fight

If you are a rude boy for life, always running into worries and strife
Rude boy for life always walking on the edge of a knife

Top shotter outer road dem, jusa gwoen like dem ah don
War fe territory wan fe own all the land
Gangstarfari Babylon dem pon the pay roll
You can have it all, but end up losing your soul

Infamous roughneck of society
Yes I'm talking to you
Don't wanner hear a word I say
Are you listening to me?
Coz I'm talking to you

If you are a rude boy for life, always running into worries and strife
Rude boy for life always walking on the edge of a knife

Because you're running out of school and you're breaking the rule
You dress up in a suit and you think say you cool
You's a rude boy running round and you're not a clown
Any boy stepping up you ah go push dem down
Rude boy for life you want the trouble and strife
Re check your steps turn from death unto life
