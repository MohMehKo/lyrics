Ain't no justice there's only just us...

Babylon ah come and dem ah try run we over 
How long dem ah treat me like an evil promoter 
Here it comes again the new depression
You know the soup is burning yet you turn up the fire

They could never test we still dem arrest we 
Now they wanna throw us in a bucket of blood 
Never past the test we but still you hate we 
Ain't no getting out of the bucket of blood

If you can see it and you believe it 
Don't tell me what or not to be 
Fight back, don't let them start it 
I believe there
Ain't no justice there's only just us

Life don't come in moderation
Taking a kicking in the polling station 
Holding, screaming, murder shoot him
Put up your hands still they shot you dead

How long have you told me that I'm a waste man
Ain't no getting out of that there bucket of blood 
How long will you hate me and try rape me 
Ain't no getting out of the bucket of blood

If you can see it and you believe it 
Don't tell me what or not to be 
Fight back, don't let them start it 
I believe there
If you can see it and you believe it 
Don't tell me what or not to be 
Fight back, don't let them start it 
I believe there
I believe there
I believe there
I believe there

Ain't no justice there's only just us...

If you can see it and you believe it 
Don't tell me what or not to be 
Fight back, don't let them start it 
I believe there
I believe there
I believe there
I believe there

Ain't no justice there's only just us
