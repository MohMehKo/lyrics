At first you don't succeed
Tried and tried again
Worked your hands to bleed
Don't give up my friendWell in this game called life you got to keep on trying
Don't make no body push you down and give you pure problem
OI! Life it is for living not for aggravation
When their getting under your skin and trying to cause you tension
You tell them, inside this flesh nuff ah we jusa suffer
And influences they will come take we over
1 think in life I and I must remember
Stand up for something and you'll hear the oppressor singing

You got to make up your mind
Life, Choices and Decisions
You got to make up your mind
Life, Choices and Decisions
Where do we go there are so many signs
Life, Choices and Decisions
You got to make up your mind
Life, Choices and Decisions

Well well at first you don't smoke weed but now you're hooked on smack
You look back over your life and you wish you could go back
Rewind reject it and start it again
You know you wouldn't end up with this juxtaposition
Right! Inside this flesh nuff ah we jusa suffer
And influences they will come take we over
1 think in life I and I must remember
Stand up for something and you'll hear the oppressor singing

To follow or to lead
Or do you just pretend?
To pause or to proceed
The choice is yours my friend

Which way do you go? Where you gunner go? I do not know! You see,
Life is one big road with lots of signs, surely you'll find
You got to make up your mind to face rality all the time
Many ah problem many ah joy
Never you try to take life for a toy
Some doing good lord some doing bad
All of these choices are driving me
Mad, So mad, driving me mad, driving me mad, driving me mad, driving me mad

Life, Choices and Decisions, Life, Choices and Decisions
Life, Choices and Decisions
Life life life life, choose life
