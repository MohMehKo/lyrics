We're born, given life and left to live
Don't know where we're going or what we're doing
It's hard to stay positive in this state of mind we're in
Feel lost and hurt, where do I begin?

Seasons of life, they change
And I want to know:
Does it have to be this way?

We live, we live, we live for love. [x2]

We begin with the cards that's in our hands
Sometimes we lose all that we need
It feels impossible to keep that strength within you
Feeling low and burnt, how did this begin?

Seasons of life, they change. 
And I want to know, does it have to be this way?

We live, we live, we live for love. [x2]

So don't give up.

One life, one love, that's how it should be
One voice, one love, and all in unity
One love, one world, the way it's meant to be

We live, we live, we live for love. [x4]
