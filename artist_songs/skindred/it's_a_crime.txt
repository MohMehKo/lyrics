Money mad are you money money mad
Money can make you happy
But it also makes you mad
Money mad are you money money mad
Money can make you happy
But it also makes you mad

Extortionate rates and prices big fat cats taking big slices
Tryin' maintain bad habits & vices
Sometimes it all feels like you're in a crisis
Lord

Empty pockets provoke you to go out and hustle
For Ganja or Coke
Even though you are broke
You will kill for a drink
You know that ain't no joke

Now I'm no judge or jury
And you can see through me
Justice scales ain't broken, and we are all guilty

It's a crime, but that's a price we got to pay
It's a crime, don't take my life away
It's a crime, but that's a price we got to pay
It's a crime, don't take my life away

Money mad what! Money money mad what
Money can make you happy
But it also makes you mad what
Money mad what! Money money mad what
Money can make you happy
But it also makes you!

Not having a penny in your pockets frustrating
When everybody around you seems to be money making
Dipping their hand in the till and just taking
Living it large because of the laws they're breaking

I'm telling you that I'm broke
But I spent my last pennies on liquor and smokes
Stealing things from my folks
At reality check point you know we all choke

Now I'm no judge or jury
And you can see through me
Justice scales ain't broken
That's why we're all guilty

It's a crime, but that's a price we got to pay
It's a crime, don't take my life away
It's a crime, but that's a price we got to pay
It's a crime, don't take my life away

So tell me how you gonna win?
Saying, how we gonna win?
If you ain't right with in?

It's a crime, but that's a price we got to pay
It's a crime, don't take my life away
It's a crime, but that's a price we got to pay
It's a crime, don't take my life away
Money mad money money mad, it's a crime
Money mad are you money money mad it's a crime

Money mad!
