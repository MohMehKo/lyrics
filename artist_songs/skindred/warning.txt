[Benji]
Ah bear vexation an run through my brain
Yes I'm bex with all of them again
From the way how I'm feeling I can not refrain
I wanna tell them so and tell them right now
It don't work when I count up to ten
Coz I still wanna blast on all of them again
I try to exercise the demons but I still get mad like RIGHT RIGHT!

You better tread lightly, you better back down
I feel it igniting, I'm losing it now
You better tread lightly...

[Jacoby]
Well anger management is what they are needing
Coz bones getting broken and noses are bleeding

Dem der ting we don't need right now
So dress back for my fuse it blow
If me see red the whole place will know
You better warn them and let them know
