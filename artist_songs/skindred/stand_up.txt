You say just drink the tonic
And it will make you super sonic 
Are you trying to murder me 
Coz I will not let it be

Oh I know that your trying to fool me 
And these no way
Oh I know that your trying to use me 
For that you'll pay

Stand up for your rights make them know 
That their wrongs your right
Stand up for your rights make them know 
That your wrongs your right

The medication makes me hazy
And my aggression makes you taze me
This pills the size of me 
and I will not let it be

Oh I know that your trying to fool me 
But there's no way
Oh I know that your trying to school me

Stand up for your rights make them know 
That their wrongs your right
Stand up for your rights make them know 
That your wrongs your right

You gotta win the fight

Life comes out swinging punches 
Took a right on the chin
The crowd there der pon dem feet 
And everybody's screaming
With that there punch it nearly lick of your head 
With dem der kinda shots it could ah left you fe dead 

Protect yourself at all times 
keep your guide up right 
Keep bobbing and moving and moving
And bobbing no make him out your light
You can drop him, you can stop him
He's on the ropes
Next thing he's on the ground done

You gotta win the fight

Stand up for your rights make them know 
That their wrongs your right
Stand up for your rights make them know 
That your wrongs your right

Stand up for your rights make them know 
That their wrongs your right
(You gotta win the fight)
Stand up for your rights make them know 
That your wrongs your right
(You gotta win the fight)
You gotta win the fight...
