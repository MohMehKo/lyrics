I know that I hit you with a full on attack
Never pulled no punches it was full contact
Now we enter the place and we no wan bring it back init?
Hit you in the heart and made a deep impact
Rock rock rock rock rock rock rock rock

I never meant to hurt you
Or do the things some people do
I know I burnt you; the scars are there for true

I know it's gunner be alright
Turn it all around and make it right
Yer I know it's gunner be all right
Get up off the ground you'll be all right

Every little thing is gunner be alright

Want you to know it hurts so much when your heart gets cracked
War in love can knock you off track
We all want revenge that's the way we react init?
It's alright we bounce back intact
Rock rock rock rock rock rock rock rock

We all fall down and hit the concrete
Get up off the ground stand up on your feet
Nursing your bruises you know you got beat
We want surrender we want retreat
There's gorra be an end to the conflictions alright

I never meant to hurt you
Or do the things that people do
I know I burnt you; the scars are there for true
I never meant to hurt you
Or do the things that people do
I know I burnt you; the scars are sad but true

But I know it's gunner be all right
Turn it all around and make it right
Yer I know it's gunner be all right
Everything's gunner be all right
Alright alright
