Telling you once, not telling you twice
It seems like the world, it just want to fight, for ever
And they don't want to live together (aah ah, aah ah)
Now is the time and this is the place
No care bout your creed, your sex or your race
Connection and nobody not get rejection (aah ah, aah ah)

We got to tell dem so
If ah no love that people is dealing
We got to make dem know
If inna dem heart, dem nah go show feeling
We got to tell dem now
If out of your mouth your food dem is stealing
We got to make dem know
Dat the whole of the world needs healing

Life and liberty dat we want now, now, now, now, now
Life and liberty dat we want now
Life and liberty dat we want now
Life and liberty dat we want

Waohaohaoh
Waohaohaoh
Blind us with lights but there's no way we're leaving
Waohaohaoh
Waohaohaoh
You can turn out the lights but there's no way we're leaving

One energy and one place to be, holding to love
And it's victory, eternal, and I know that it must concern all (aah ah, aah ah)
One world for you and one world for me, wit dem ya philosophy
I don't agree, reject dat and I totally disrespect dat (aah ah, aah ah)

We got to tell dem now
If out of your mouth your food dem is stealing
We got to make dem know
Dat the whole of the world needs healing

Life and liberty dat we want now, now, now, now, now
Life and liberty dat we want now
Life and liberty dat we want now
Life and liberty dat we want

Waohaohaoh
Waohaohaoh
Blind us with lights but there's no way we're leaving
Waohaohaoh

You can turn out the lights but there's no way we're leaving

No, we're not leaving
No, we're not leaving
No, we're not leaving
