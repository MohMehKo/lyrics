No one can do this alone!
I wanna trade this dirty hat for a crown.
Inside my shoe there's a stone.
And where it came from nobody knows.
Now this is a mission
Suffer with decisions

Still with all that I'm saying time will tell.

Were stepping it up and we never really let them know.
We are the champion victorious right now
You play the game the aim to win, to wipe the smile right off ya face
For he who fights and runs away, will live to fight another day!
Game over! Pass the controller
Game over! Pass the controller
You're done dead already and you got to move over
Game over! Pass the controller!

I know I gotta do this alone, I wanna be the king that sits on the throne!
You can't get blood from a stone, gravity's gonna keep us all on the ground.
I ain't in submission now suffer your decisions.

Still with all that I'm saying time will tell.

Were stepping up and we ah go really let them know.
We are the champion victorious right now
You play the game the aim to win, to wipe the smile right off ya face
For he who fights and runs away, will live to fight another day!
Game over! Pass the controller
Game over! Pass the controller
You're done dead already and you got to move over
Game over! Pass the controller!

No one can do this alone!...

Were stepping up and we ah go really let them know.
We are the champion victorious right now
You play the game the aim to win, to wipe the smile right off ya face
For he who fights and runs away, will live to fight another day!
Game over! Pass the controller
Game over! Pass the controller
Your done dead already and you got to move over
Game over! Pass the controller!
