Now you don't know, see the world is on fire 
and the flames are get higher. 
Where you gonna run, why?

Flash a light to watch the world burn. 
Everybody in the picture know you bet are concerned. 
Don't see smoke without no fire. 
And you can't make no sense of the dark.

Worlds on fire. [x4]

Call on scene and there's no mercy, whoa. 
The truth is it ain't getting better, whoa. 
We don't need a damn thing, no no. 
We don't need that no no. 
Fuck the road we don't need see don't no no. 
We don't need that no.

Burns higher than California. 
Release the trees from urgency.

Get out, get out, the world's on fire. 
Dancing on the surface of the blazing sun. 
Get out, get out, the world's on fire. 
(World's on fire.)

From the magma we must return. 
Playing with the fire, ya gonna get burned. 
One strike and the world go boom. 
Nuclear war will bring the doom.

Worlds on fire. [x4]

Call on scene and there's no mercy, whoa. 
The truth is it ain't getting better, whoa. 
We don't need a damn thing, no no. 
We don't need that no no. 
Fuck the road we don't need see don't no no. 
We don't need that no.

Burns higher than California. 
Release the trees from urgency.

Get out, get out, the world's on fire. 
Dancing on the surface of the blazing sun. 
Get out, get out, the world's on fire. 
(World's on fire.)
