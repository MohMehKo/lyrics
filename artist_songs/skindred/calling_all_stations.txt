Look in the face of your adversary
Tell them what you want, and how will this come to be
Don't let them keep you down wid no 
Me seh, fire fi dem, fire fi dem

You know you gotta work much harder, eh eh eh
You gotta be much badder, eh eh eh
And if them try control you
Seh seh Fire fi dem, me seh fire fi dem

Rise from the depths of the underground
Leave the city and kill the sound
Don't let them stop you from being loud

Calling all stations, turn it up
Rules and regulations, turn it up
Can't tell me what to do, we're gonna turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up now
Sound liberation, Sound liberation

Stand your ground and stand up strong
Don't let them count you in dem pollution
Tek you hand from me throat, me no do you no wrong
Me seh fire fi dem, me seh fire fi dem

No bodda disrespect this
No bodda come distress this
Dem fi try, you a go feel it
Fire fi dem, me seh fire fi dem

Rise from the depths of the underground
Leave the city and kill the sound
Don't let them stop you from being loud

Calling all stations, turn it up
Rules and regulations, turn it up
Can't tell me what to do, we're gonna turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up now
Sound liberation, whoaaa, gotta do this right now
Calling all stations, whoaaa, gotta do this right now
