Now it's your decision whats going on
You won't always be that strong
Your ammunition is running out
And you know that without a doubt
A small axe can chop a tree down
And your victory won't always be around

You will hit the ground
You will hit the ground
When the time comes round your going down I know you hear what they said
When the time comes round your going down you got to tell them still
When the right one comes no matter how big your falling their falling
When you catch them right and they ain't looking dem falling mans falling

Now there comes a time for everyone
You've got to hang up your guns
You see in life there's something we must learn
No matter how stable your life can turn
You see a small axe can chop a big tree down
And your victory won't always be around

You will hit the ground
You will hit the ground
When the time comes round your going down I know you hear what they said
When the time comes round your going down you got to tell them still
When the right one comes no matter how big your falling their falling
When you catch you right and you ain't looking your falling they're falling

No matter how you big and how you stay 
and how you stand you cannot always be the don 
the reigning champion your falling man's 
falling your falling man's falling

Blood on the dance floor and everywhere
Man talking about man how they don't care
First you reach top then they get drop
Lick the man out with an excellent shot
Do you want some of that
Lick of the head top
The engine too hot with this cylinder 
we're stepping up and up a gear
With this 58 I'm letting of steam
Dj sturgess bad boy machine
You ah to come hard coz your part of the team
You can't walk alone man your part of the dream
You see a small axe can chop a big tree down
And your victory won't always be around
I said a small axe can chop a big tree down
And your victory won't always be around

When the time comes round your going down You will hit the ground
When the time comes round your going down You will hit the ground
When the time comes round your going down You will hit the ground
When the time comes round your going down
You will hit the
