Frustration hits you, you wake up in the morning
A brand new day, brings a brand new mourning
Reasons to be tearful, clap one two and three
Standing in the edge of insanity

Oh, I'm looking for dollars and fine dimes
Oh, I'm looking for dollars and fine dimes

The mental rages every day that you're breathing
What you're giving out you're not always receiving
The more you pay the more it won't go away
Stacked up to the sky, I hear when they say

Oh, I'm looking for dollars and fine dimes
Oh, I'm looking for dollars and fine dimes

This city's ours, this city's cold
It breaks your heart
It is hard to keep the wolves from your door
To keep the wolves from your door
To keep the wolves from your door
To keep the wolves from your door

So disappointing, it breaks your heart
So disappointing, it breaks your heart
So disappointing, it breaks your heart
So disappointing, it breaks your heart

It's all over, it's all over now.
It's all over, it's all over now.
It's all over, it's all over now.
It's all over, it's all over now.
It's all over, it's all over now.
It's all over, it's all over now.

This city's ours, this city's cold
It breaks your heart
It is hard to keep the wolves from your door
To keep the wolves from your door
To keep the wolves from your door
To keep the wolves from your door
