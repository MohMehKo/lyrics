Now in the street there is violence 
And a lots of work to be done 
No place to hang out our washing 
and I can't blame all on the sun, oh no 

We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue 
And then we'll take it higher 
we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue 
And then we'll take it higher 

Workin' so hard like a soldier 
And can't afford a thing on TV 
Deep in my heart, I'm a warrior 
And can't get food for them kids, good God 

We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue 
And then we'll take it higher 
Oh, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue 
And then we'll take it higher 

Oh no... 
Oh no... 
Oh no... 
Oh no.. 

We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue 
And then we'll take it higher 
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue 
And then we'll take it higher 

Who is to blame in one country 
You never can get to the one 
Dealin' in multiplication 
And you know you never can to feed everyone, oh no 

We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue 
And then we'll take it higher 
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue 
And then we'll take it higher 

Out in the street... 
Out in the street... 
Out in the daytime... 
Out in the night... 

We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue 
And then we'll take it higher 
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue 
And then we'll take it higher 

Out in the street... 
Out in the street... 
Out in the playground... 
In the dark side of town.. 

We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue 
And then we'll take it higher 
Oh, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue 
And then we'll take it higher
