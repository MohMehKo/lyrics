All that you're going through
There the scars that you know life's true
That's a thing that we have to do
To grow you feel the pain
Every step you are closer to
Everything that you wanna do
Live it up cause you know it's true
In life's too short they say

If I don't get what I, what I've been fighting for
If I don't get what I, what I've been striving for
At least I had a good time trying
At least I had a good time trying
At least I had a good time trying
And I never went out crying

Now when you got time to live
You give all you can give
3 words we're saying "Life's worth living"
Now you got time to live
You give all you can give
3 words we're saying "Life's worth living"

[?] self you be true
And the rest will follow you
From your heart know what to do
It works in every way
Giving more than you're asking for
To the rich and to the poor
Now there's something worth going for
In every one the same

If I don't get what I, what I've been fighting for
If I don't get what I, what I've been striving for
At least I had a good time trying
At least I had a good time trying
At least I had a good time trying
And I never went out crying

Now when you got time to live
You give all you can give
3 words we're saying "Life's worth living"
Now you got time to live
You give all you can give
3 words we're saying "Life's worth living"

Throw down your arms and come
Throw down your arms and come
Come every nation come
Throw down your arms and come

Now when you got time to live
You give all you can give
3 words we're saying "Life's worth living"

Now when you got time to live
Then give all you can give
3 words we're saying "Life's worth living"

We live a life we live
3 words we're saying "Life's worth living"
