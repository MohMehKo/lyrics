Black child, born Jamaica
Crossed the ocean on a wind-ward sailboat
Twisted guitar he's a got an' a gangster
Rude boy from the trench-town streets

And he knows, he knows he's gonna have it all
He's standin' like he's 10 feet tall

He knows he's gonna have it all
The streets, the rise, the fall
Loud music, salvation
And the kids are right now
Loud music’s my salvation
And the kids are right now

White child, raised in Brixton
Born again through the radio sound
And lot of tape and a lot of distortion
Studies and he makes the sound

And he knows, he knows he's gonna have it all
He' standin' like he's 10 feet tall

He knows he's gonna have it all
The streets, the rise, the fall
Loud music salvation
And the kids are right now
Loud music’s my salvation
And the kids are right now

Loud music's salvation
And the kids are right now
Loud music’s my salvation
And the kids are right now
Loud music’s my salvation
And the kids are right now
Dey're right now

Black child, born Jamaica

He knows he's gonna have it all

Loud music’s my salvation
And the kids are right now
Loud music’s my salvation
And the kids are right now

Pass it on, pass it on, pass it on, we're passin'
