What's going on with earth?
Don't you know what a life is worth
It's all getting wilder everyday
No worldwide security, no love there it's plain to see
And that not the way it's meant to be
We must be strong
We got to get along
Now look inside yourself
You'll find the strength to carry on
We must be strong
In so much confusion
They're playing tit for tat and dem increase the tension

And it's days like these
When everyone dem really need to come together
Days like these, who wants to live?
We got to live in
Days like these
When everyone dem really need to come together
Days like these, who wants to live?
Live! 

So many just out for themselves
And trust in material wealth
You're building your mansions on the sand
By building new ways of war
You're breaking and bending the law
And who know's what's next
And what is in store?

We must be strong
We got to get along
Now look inside yourself
You'll find the strength to carry on
We must be strong
In so much confusion
They're playing tit for tat and dem increase the tension

And it's days like these
When everyone dem really need to come together
Days like these, who wants to live?
We got to live in
Days like these
When everyone dem really need to come together
Days like these, who wants to live?
Live! 

These times we're living in, head down I cry for sure
One love one aim one heart
We don't need none of that, we don't need none of that
These times we're living in I just can't take much more
We don't need none of that, we don't need none of that

In days like these, and it's days like these
When everyone dem really need to come together
Days like these, who wants to live?
We got to live in
Days like these
When everyone dem really need to come together
Days like these, we got to live
We got to live in
