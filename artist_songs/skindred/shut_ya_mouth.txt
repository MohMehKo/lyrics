You see the difference between you and me 
Is that I like you but you don't like me
Face each day optimistically
Breath and talk a lot of positivity
If anything bad it's gonna happen to me 
That not the attitude seriously
Nah not the way to perceive it
If they tell you so don't believe it you tell dem

Shut your mouth boy come out of here
Shut your mouth boy come out of here we tell dem 
Do you hear me hear me hear me now
You won't break this here's my rasied sts 
And I'm telling you no no no
You won't break this here's my rasied sts 
And I'm telling you no no no

Taking the battle to the under ground
We nah go hear or fear your sound
Taking the battle to the under ground
We nah go hear or fear your sound
If you don't hear me then your gonna feel me right now

Suicide cant take it no more
You don't wanna go outside your front door 
Take a breath and you will be free
What you think that what you will be 
Words that you say destroy a person
Don't feel up your head with pollution 
Anything you want you'll achieve it
If they tell you no don't believe it
You tell dem

Shut your mouth boy come out of here
Shut your mouth boy come out of here we tell dem 
Do you hear me hear me hear me now
You won't break this here's my rasied sts 
And I'm telling you no no no
You won't break this here's my rasied sts 
And I'm telling you no no no

Taking the battle to the under ground
We nah go hear or fear your sound
Taking the battle to the under ground
We nah go hear or fear your sound
If you don't hear me then your gonna feel me right now

Well greedy does what greedy does and venom it will talk 
My mamma used to tell me not to play inna de dark
You see it's in your actions and the way you carry on
Your like a lollipop against the blazing sun

I been there I done that I smoked that one
So you better watch your mouth before you bite that tongue 
Now on judgement day where the wicked ah go run
So I hope that mouth is just a phase my son

You blab blab here and you blab blab there
Your run that mouth like you just don't care
And your get worse when you've had a drink
Coz your carry on like your shit don't stink

You don't want this no no
You better clip those wings no no
You better change them tings no no
And watch out for sharks yeah
