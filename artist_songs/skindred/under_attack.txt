Now if you really want war you've got to be sick 
All of the people they need to hear this
From the sound of the riddim you cant refuse it
Shocking dropping wrongs and killing Graduation that's what we want
Fuck the nation that's not the answer
They're coming at you with shots in the dark
And shots dem ah give you ah go rip out your heart

Who is gonna help them ohh take care of all of them
Who is gonna help them ohh take care of all of them
And now I realise you can't cut me down to size 
and now I realise we're under attack

We ah go stack dem 5 7 and 8
No bodder with the badness man we don't appreciate
We are go merk dem 6 7 and 9
Put dem on the hit list every time
Lifes at stake and everyones shaking
Dancehall breaking everyones faking
It's going down now 
It's going down now
It's go down down da down da down

Who is gonna help them ohh take care of all of them
Who is gonna help them ohh take care of all of them
And now I realise you can't cut me down to size 
and now I realise we're under attack

No we don't want no war
No we don't want no war
I believe we're all under attack
I believe we're all under attack
I believe we're all under attack
all under attack all under attack
I believe we're all under attack
I believe we're all under attack
I believe we're all under attack
all under attack all under attack

Who is gunna help them ohh take care of all of them
Who is gunna help them ohh take care of all of them
And now I realise you can't cut me down to size 
and now I realise we're under attack

I'm sick of all of this bullshit
Skindred soldier dem down for the full lick
Heaven sent with a ow that they've stolen
I'm saying yes and they're saying nah blud
Dem ah try fe get me all upset
Dem ah try fe get my pussy all fucking wet
Dem ah try do wha dem ah try fe do

The reason why I'm saying I'm talking to you
Uno can't talk like this you know you must resist
Get the names back on the hit list
Uno can't talk like this you know you must resist
Get the names back on the hit list
Uno can't talk like this you know you must resist
Get the names back on the hit list
Uno can't talk like this you know you must resist
There's the bell now class is dismissed
