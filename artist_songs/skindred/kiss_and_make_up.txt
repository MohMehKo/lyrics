Take your anger out on me
Slap me round no one can see
We're the perfect family
Make up hides the scars daily
Take your anger out on me
Slap me round no one can see
We're the perfect family
Make up hides the scars daily
Living under fear of you
Heavy hands make my skin blue
Smile don't let the neighbours see
We're the perfect family
Kiss and make up
Kiss and make up
Kiss and make up
Kiss and make up
In this house the fights come more
Screaming has made my throat sore
When it's all smashed and you too
That's when the demons scream through you
If you're sick of me like I'm sick of you
Then just pack your stuff you know just what to do
Then the kind of thing I cannot take no more
And the way you gun leaves me on the floor 
[Chorus]
[middle 8]
Take your anger out on me
Slap me round no one can see
We're the perfect family
Make up hides the scars daily
Sick of you like you're sick of me
Then just pack your shit and then let it be
You're abuse I can't take no more
And the way you gun leaves me on the floor
Kiss and make up
Kiss and make up
[Chorus]
[screaming outro]
