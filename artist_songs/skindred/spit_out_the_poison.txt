Is there an antidote for what? You've lied
The venom creeps and saturates your pride

Spit out the poison
Get it out get it out of me get it out
Spit out the poison
Get it out get it out of me get it out

Everything I try to do you stand and scrutinise
Insult me with your venom, I believed your lies
But no longer will I be willing, to sit back and keep chilling
I'm coming for you, you hear what I say
Inside a tomb in a grave I won't lay
Believe your hype no not me no no way
You make me sick I gorra

Spit out the poison
Draw the venom out you gorra draw it out
Spit out the poison
Draw the venom out you gorra draw it out

Slaughter my confidence with the harmful words you say
Too long you tore me up left me in disarray
Always bringing me down and filling my mind and my soul you're not killing
I'm coming for you, you hear what I say
Inside this grave in a tomb I won't lay
Believe your hype no not me no no way
I'm coming for you!

Is there an antidote for what? You've lied
The venom creeps and saturates your pride

Spit out the poison
Draw the venom out you gorra draw it out
Spit out your poison
Before it kills you...
