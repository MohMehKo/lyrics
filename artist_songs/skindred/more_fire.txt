Fire Man
Calling the fire man
Oh yeah uh yeah
Fire

There's a mountain that's full of snow
But the flames they're out of control
You can climb but the tops too far
Trying to get higher touch the stars
Quite easy it'll make you change your ways
You've been dancing and staying out for days

It is up to you whatever you do
When the music stops there's no one but you
Fire man
Calling the fire man
Ah yeah ah yeah
Fire man
Calling the fire man
Ah yeah oh yeah mhmmm

I'll start the fire
You start the fire
We start the fire
But we can't put it out
Can't put it out
Can't put it out no
Can't put it out oh

On the banks of the hudson streams
There's a man who is stealing dreams
Wears his heart like the lion stone
Make you old before you're grown

What's easy for you ain't easy for me
We're coming apart at the seams
Fire man
Calling the fire man
Ah yeah ah well mhmmm
Fire man
Calling the fire man
Ah yeah oh yeah mhmmm now

I'll start the fire
You start the fire
We start the fire
But we can't put it out
Can't put it out no
Can't put it out no
Can't put it out no

I'll start the fire
Start the fire
Start the fire

Brrea-ea-ea-ea-ea-ea more fire [x8]
