Tell this fool in my face I don't need enemies so I'm asking you to move back a little,
Why you bigging up your chest and you're thinking that you're tough
Don't you know that every bone is brittle?
Everything will be fine if you just cool out yourself and don't do no crime
Now I'm asking you to move mate! Step it back a little, step back a little
