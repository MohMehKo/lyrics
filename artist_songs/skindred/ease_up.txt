Ease up and cool out cuz time is running out
Co me say ease up a little ease up a lot
Ease uppa ease uppa ease uppa ease uppa

These times are dangerous even the blind can see
Weapons in those schoolyards with that I can't agree
That they run out of shots God knows I got to pray
Gun talk and bullet youth choose another way

You no hear Micheal Moore him ah talk
Dem who buy the bullet ah go ignite the spark me say
Me no want what the gunman ah deal
Dem der kind of bargain to I man it don't appeal

Ease up and cool out coz time is running out
Ease up and cool out the future is in doubt
Ease up and cool out coz time is running out
Ease up

Just press the button and we all go up in flames
We tell the children no yet we play our war games
It's getting out of hand and growing everyday
We squeeze the trigger yet the problems they remain

Ease up and cool out coz time is running out
Ease up and cool out the future is in doubt
Ease up and cool out yes time is running out
Ease up and cool out the future is in doubt

Gunfire, Satan's a liar,
pouring on the petrol and the flames are getting higher
Inspire, lyrics catch a fire,
tell the people something that's what I want and desire
Gunfire, gunfire

Where you going with that gun in your hand?
Thinks that your rough you want to own the land
One day soon your gunner bite the dust
So get your finger of the trigger coz that's dangerous

Ease up and cool out coz time is running out
Ease up and cool out the future is in doubt
Ease up and cool out yes time is running out
Ease up and cool out the future is in doubt
Ease up

Me no want wha de gunman ah deal
Dem der kind of bargain to I man it don't appeal
Me no want wha de gunman ah sell
Dem der kinda ting it ah go land you inna hell

Just take a look around man what do you see?
Gunman, dem a turn crazy
Dem fire gun and bullets ah fly and dem ah kill off the youth
Just cool out me Bredrin coz you know it ah de truth!
Ease up and cool out coz time is running out
