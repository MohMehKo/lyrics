Tell them that you love them while they're here
Tell them while you got the chance

Always thought that you'd be here
I never imagined a world without you
I put of what I could do today
And said that I'll go see you tomorrow

But it's too late now coz you're no longer here
But it's too late now coz you're no longer here

I'm saying it now but I wish I said it before
I'm saying it now but I wish I said it before
I sit here crying in this room
With memories rushing back of you
So many now chances now I blew
There was a million times I could of said I love you

But it's too late now coz you're no longer here
But it's too late now coz you're no longer here

I'm saying it now but I wish I said it before
I'm saying it now but I wish I said it before
I'm saying it now but I wish I said
I'm saying it now but I wish I said
I'm saying it now but I wish I said it before said it before

There is no remedy that can entwine
Each day it cripples me that is my crime

Never again again again again again
Never again again again again again

I'm saying it now but I wish I said it before
I'm saying it now but I wish I said it before
I'm saying it now but I wish I said
I'm saying it now but I wish I said 
I'm saying it now but I wish I said it before

I should of said that I love you
