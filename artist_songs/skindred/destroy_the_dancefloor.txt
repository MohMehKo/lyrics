La la la leng, la la la la leng
That's the way the Dred come switch the program

Co we enter the room you know we're rougher dan dem
Bring it like this no problem and we
Knocking dem out like the world champion
True we are the winners in the competition

Well everyone keep moving well the Dj's spinnin
And all the girl dem shaking it yeyee
We get the dancefloor pumping everyone dem jumping
And you know that Skindred don't play

One ah dem come, you know dem get drop
Two ah dem come, dem have fe turn back
Three ah them come, dead of heart attack

Destroy the dancefloor
Well that's how we do it we rock the place nice we move the crowd right we
Electric Avenue the vibes ah come through you know what to do we
Ah nuff girl dem ah move tight to this grove bounce to this tune we
Eternally rock the music don't stop you know we so hot we

No need for bad connection

Crowd rocking and everyone's psyched
Girl dem ah rock and you know dem look right

I love the way you're moving well the Dj's spinnin
And everyone dem shaking it yeyee
We get the dancefloor pumping everyone dem jumping
And you know that Skindred don't play
