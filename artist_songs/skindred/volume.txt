And so again you know we're on it
Don't even bother try to tell we stop it 
I'll take them straight to the hanging tree
This is the sound that makes me nasty
No body ramp with this sound quality
Believing in the rockers and the riddim that's in me
We come to rock your spot bring the energy

Why you wouldn't try this dj dem supply 
this everybody taste this ruff neck sound
Turn up the volume make the speakers dem blow
Life on track not turning back 
And never let it go grow
Life on track not turning back
Keep turning it up the volume the volume 
the volume the volume the volume the volume
Keep turning it up the volume the volume 
the volume the volume the volume the volume

So me say broke up broke upmake the people jump up
Queue way down the road and make the people line up
Gal ah wine up to the metal do the dirty wine slut
And the dance nah done until the speaker dem fucked

Why you would try this dj dem supply 
this everybody taste this ruff neck sound
Do not touch it do not touch it do not touch the dial
Turn up the volume make the speakers dem blow
Life on track not turning back 
And never let it go grow
Life on track not turning back
Keep turning it up the volume the volume 
the volume the volume the volume the volume
Keep turning it up the volume the volume 
the volume the volume the volume the volume

Keep it down keep it down keep it down

Woop gotta keep it loud now
Play your sound and feel no way
Woop woop gotta keep it loud now
Play your music every day
Woop gotta keep it loud now
Play your sound and feel no way
Woop woop gotta keep it loud now
I can't keep it down I can't keep it down

Life on track not turning back 
And never let it go grow
Life on track not turning back 
And never let it go grow
Life on track not turning back
Keep turning it up the volume the volume 
the volume the volume the volume the volume
Keep turning it up the volume the volume
