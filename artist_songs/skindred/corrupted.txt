turns me off it's vile
lying every way
living for the prey

Whatever to you
Get up, you've gone corrupted
I see that it's true
Get up, you've got corrupted

Taken aback the way you love me
Taken aback the way you were
Someone we could all could trust

I see that it's true
Get up, you've got corrupted

No mercy

then that trust, it starts to rust

turns me off it's vile
lying every way
living for the prey
