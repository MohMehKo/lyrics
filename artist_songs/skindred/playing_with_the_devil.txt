As poor as you may be, 
the only one you're hurting is your family. 
Robbing yourself, it makes no sense. 
You steal a million but then end up with cents..

Cause the devil dances in empty pockets 
and you're never gonna win by firing rockets. 
Hear me when I say.

So much chaos in these streets, you see that. 
From the heat there's no retreat, you know that. 
To the less you only beat, you hear that? 
You can't handle no defeat..

But the devil dances in empty pockets 
and you're never gonna win by firing rockets. 
Hear me when I say.

Oh, we don't need that to know. 
Oh, we don't need that.

Because playing with the devil 
causes the lightning and thunder. [x2]

Oh, here's what we gotta do is move this forward, 
tell him that we're coming through. [x4]

I smell that plastic burning. 
Sobered from burning plastic. [x2]

Because playing with the devil 
causes the lightning and thunder. [x2]

Oh, here's what we gotta do is move this forward, 
tell him that we're coming through. [x4]
