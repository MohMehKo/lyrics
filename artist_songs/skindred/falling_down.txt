There's a hole in my head 
And the lines they just 
can't stop falling out 
And the truth from my lips 
I scream it without a doubt 
I always did as you said 
Even though it was against my will 
Ain't afraid any longer 
Just hear as my lips they spill 

Spit the words out 
I cant stop from making 
this noise no more 
Spit the words out 
I cant stop from being SO paranoid 

I will not fall for you 
Not falling down for you 
I will not fall for you 

I don't regret what I said 
you're like a weight that 
just held me down 
Everything that I once was 
You changed and made me your clown 
No I'm not holding your hand 
And I want you to move from me 
I want to know that I've found a peace 
From you am eternally free 

Spit the words out 
I cant stop from making 
this noise no more 
Spit the words out 
I cant stop from being SO paranoid 

I will not fall for you 
Not falling down for you 
I will not fall for you 

Spit the words out 
I cant stop from being SO paranoid 
Being so paranoid 
Making this noise no more 
Being so paranoid 
Making this noise no more 

Not falling down for you 
I will not fall for you 
Not falling down for you 
I will not fall for you
