"Boy you know, me ah fe go leave dat town yo you know! Ca' it too hot you know, it too hot man"

I'm walking from the bottom and I'm stepping to the top
I see these mental cases and it's just like watching cops
It's not easy to say who is your friend or who's your foe?
Some people look so dodgy, don't even look over bro
They whisper as you're passing
"Want some rock some brown or blow?"
Sometimes it does get heavy when you tell the bastards no
The road is getting hard, the time is getting worst
I'm feeling like my mind is gunner blow

I wanna break from the routine, you all feel the same
And there's no use in pointing fingers coz everybody share the blame, it's all!
Killing me, believe me
Now everyday there is a battle, everyday against the grime
The news reporter tells us that we all are into crime
Abuse in every corner every house and body part
So quick to jump and use your fist "Ay Bredrin, don't you start"
Community no unity the place it has no heart
The hatred and the disrespect is tearing us apart
The road is getting hard, the time is getting worst
I'm feeling like me mind is gunner blow

Well uno stand up inna doorway look menacing as hell
You're wearing a bandana so the cameras can't tell
It ties you up, and locks you up and that's where you will dwell
It's so stereotypical that you've got to rebel tell the people

Don't be a part of that
I'm gunner tell you that you won't be a part of that
Let me hear you saying that you
Won't be a part of that
No no no no no no no you
Won't be a part of that
No no no no no no no you
Won't be a part of that
Let me hear you saying that you
Won't be a part of that
No no no no because it's killing me killing you killing me killing you

I wanna break free from this caught up world, it's killing me, believe me
I want to break from the routine, you all feel the same
And there's no use in pointing fingers coz everybody share the blame, it's all!
Killing me, killing me, you're all killing me killing me
