We were young just having fun and
Running around in the dark
And they all told us it was wrong that
It should end before it started

It must've been our names were written in the stars
Cause a love so strong could break too many hearts
And I never believed in destiny but you and I were always meant to be
You and I were always meant to be

They tried to build a wall between us
Always keeping you away
But we were never defeated
It just made you wanna stay

It must've been our names were written in the stars
Cause a love so strong could break too many hearts
And I never believed in destiny but you and I were always meant to be
You and I were always meant to be

However hard it is
Your love comes easily
No matter how they tried
You and I were always meant to be
You and I were always meant to be

It must've been our names were written in the stars
Cause a love so strong could break too many hearts
And I never believed in destiny but you and I were always meant to be
You and I were always meant to be
You and I were always meant to be
