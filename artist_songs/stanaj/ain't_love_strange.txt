Baby, I know I've been here before.
Oh, something feels familiar.
Strange that when I gaze at you
it's deja-vu.
Strange I never thought I'd feel the way I do.

Like my future and my past
Got the same name, got the same eyes,
Got the same smile.
Maybe in a past life you were queen,
Maybe in my past life I was king.
Maybe we were made eternities ago.
And maybe we didn't know.

Stranger things had happened.
How strange would it be
If I told you I believe you were made for me?
Made for me, yeah.
made for me.
Oh, made for me, yeah.
made for me.
Oh, made for me, yeah.
made for me, yeah.
Made for me, made for me.

Ain't it funny how strangers
Became this entangled?
And ain't it funny I don't ever wanna let it go?
Ain't love strange?

Baby, I know I've seen you before.
It's like staring in a mirror.
Strange like we're in a twilight,
But it feels so right.
Strange that we're never changing,
But you changed my life.

Maybe you and I
Possibly could find
That we are divine,
heavenly designed.
Falling for each other at the same time.
Calling to each other, calling to each other.
Maybe we were made eternities ago.
And maybe we didn't know.

Stranger things had happened.
How strange would it be
If I told you I believe you were made for me?
Made for me, yeah.
Made for me.
Oh, made for me, yeah.
Made for me.
Oh, made for me, yeah
Made for me, yeah
Made for me, made for me.

Ain't it funny how strangers
Became this entangled?
And ain't it funny I don't ever wanna let it go?

But maybe we are from a place
Where time and space
Won't end.
Maybe, maybe we came from the stars
Maybe an angel flung into my arms.
Maybe, baby,
I've seen crazier things.

Stranger things had happened.
How strange would it be
If I told you I believe you were made for me?
Made for me, yeah
Made for me.
Oh, made for me, yeah.
Made for me, yeah.
Oh, made for me, yeah.
Made for me, yeah.
Made for me, made for me.

Ain't it funny how strangers
Became this entangled?
And ain't it funny I don't ever wanna let it go?
Ain't love strange?

Oh, ain't love strange?
