Yeah
You say I make you shy
I don't know why
Every time we kiss
It gets better every time
Underneath the light
You're shining so bright
The tension in the air
You could cut it with a knife
See, I'm just tryna be somebody
You got me in love so deep
No, I don't got to do these things
But you make me

You make me wanna be romantic
You make me wanna be a star
You make me wanna act different
I love you for who you are
You make me want to run circles around you
So glad that I found you
You make me wanna be romantic
You make me wanna be a star

Have you got the time?
We could do dinner and wine
I could complement you
But that would take all night
See, I'm just tryna be somebody
You got me in love so deep
No, I don't got to do these things
But you make me

You make me wanna be romantic
You make me wanna be a star
You make me wanna act different
I love you for who you are
You make me wanna run circles around you
So glad that I found you
You make me wanna be romantic
You make me wanna be a star

You make me wanna be romantic
You make me wanna be a star
You make me wanna be different
Love you for who you are
You make me wanna do circles around you
So glad I found you
I just wanna be romantic
I just wanna be a star

You make me wanna do things I never seem to do
Never said those three words
But I say'em to you
You make me wanna say things I never seem to say
Make me ask why I'm always acting this way
You make me wanna do things I never seem to do
Never said those three words
But I say'em to you
You make me wanna say things and never seem to say
You make me ask
Why the hell I'm acting this way

You make me wanna be romantic
You make me wanna be a star
You make me wanna act different
I love you for who you are
You make me wanna run circles around you
So glad that I found you
You make me wanna be romantic
You make me wanna be a star
