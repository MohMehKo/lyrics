I can see a million faces, I could be in a million places
Seen every season change but I made up my mind
Spotlight on a centre stage, all alone and my thoughts are replaying
Same feeling just a different day, I still got you on my mind

I'll give you the time if you're ready to leave
But when you say that it's over, no it's not over for me
When you're done with your searching and you know what you need
When it's finally over I hope you find me
When it's finally over I hope you find me

Do you feel me when you feel the breeze
Do you see when you fall asleep
Do you need me and begin to reach when you realize I'm not there
Cause I know we were meant to be and it makes it easy to believe that you'll be coming back to me from wherever you are

I'll give you the time if you're ready to leave
But when you say that it's over, no it's not over for me
When you're done with your searching and you know what you need
When it's finally over I hope you find me
When it's finally over I hope you find me

I hope you find me
Ohhh
I hope you find me
I hope you find me
Ohhh

I'll give you the time if you're ready to leave
But when you say that it's over, no it's not over for me
When you're done with your searching and you know what you need
When it's finally over I hope you find me
When it's finally over I hope you find me
When it's finally over I hope you find me
