She's a bad, bad girl

From the moment that we started
Love was blazing in the air
Every piece of you was guarded
But some how I didn't care

I catch you from danger
Held you like no other
A beautiful stranger
And you sent my body flying
Your claws on the table
A freak undercover
'Cause she was my angel, angel, angel

She's a bad woman
And she goes unannounced
She give you no warning
Gonna send your body flying
But before you know you're lying on the ground
(She's a bad, bad...)
Lying on the ground
(She's a bad, bad...)

Killer kiss, her touch is golden
Get you high, then leave you crushed
You never know which way she's going
Guess that's the mystery of love

I catch you from danger
Held you like no other
'Cause she was my angel, angel, angel

She's a bad woman
And she goes unannounced
She give you no warning
Gonna send your body flying
But before you know you're lying on the ground
(She's a bad, bad...)
Lying on the ground
(She's a bad, bad...)

Ground
Lying on the ground
(Oh, I'm lying on the ground)

She's a bad woman (Oh, you're so bad baby)
And she goes unannounced (Oh)
She give you no warning (Give you no warning)
Gonna send your body flying (Oh)
But before you know you're lying on the ground
(She's a bad, bad...)
Lying on the ground
(She's a bad, bad...)
Lying on the ground
(She's a bad, bad...)
Lying on the ground
(She's a bad, bad...)

She's a bad woman
