I'm hellbent on you seeing yourself the way I see,
You--you're fucking flawless, baby
I'm hellbent on you feeling yourself the way I feel,
You--you're feeling lost, baby

Reading your body with both hands
Won't let you go till I understand
Make you love you like I am
It's killing me to think you don't 
See yourself the way that you are 
In and out you're beautiful

I'm telling you
I'll never let you sleep alone, no
The goddamn truth
I'll never let you sleep alone, sleep alone, no

You never treat yourself right but promise you that I, would
I hope I'm getting to you
Give me one night or your whole life and I'll do it so good
I know I'm getting to you

Reading your body with both hands
Won't let you go till I understand
Make you love you like I am
It's killing me to think you don't
See yourself the way that you are 
In and out you're beautiful

I'm telling you
I'll never let you sleep alone, no
The goddamn truth, the goddamn truth baby
I'll never let you sleep alone, sleep alone

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Stay dreaming, stay dreaming, stay dreaming with me
Stay dreaming, stay dreaming 
I'm telling you
I'll never let you sleep alone, I'll never let you sleep alone
Never let you sleep, never let you sleep alone

Never ever, never ever
Never ever, never ever

It's killing me to think you don't
See yourself the way that you are
Don't you know that in and out you're beautiful?

I'm telling you
I'll never let you sleep alone...
I'll never let you sleep...
The goddamn truth...
The goddamn truth...
I'll never let you sleep alone, sleep alone...

Stay dreaming, stay dreaming, stay dreaming with me
Stay dreaming, stay dreaming, stay dreaming 
I'm telling you 
I'll never let you sleep alone, sleep alone
