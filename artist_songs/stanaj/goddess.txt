She's so mystical
Run me to my knees
Feel like an animal
Sacrifice me please

She shuts the stars at night
Just because she can
She's electrify
I can't even stand it, oh

I can't compare to the power of her
A kiss from her lips, and I've fall from the art
I tried to go slow, but there's no sense of time
But I know when the planets a line

It's love beyond the sky
It's love beyond the sky
I think the earth collide
Cause it's love beyond the sky
It's love beyond the sky

Lost my gravity
I can barely breathe
I might not make it back
But don't feel bad for me, oh

Cause I can't compare to the power of her
I look in her eyes, and I don't miss the air
I tried to go slow, but there's no sense of time
Now I know when the planets a line

And it's love beyond the sky
Oh it's love beyond the sky
When heaven and earth collide
It's love beyond the sky
It's love beyond the sky

Oh
(I've said it's love beyond the)
(Girl it's love)
Oh

Cause I can't compare to the power of her
I look in her eyes, and I don't miss the air
I tried to go slow, there's no sense of time
Now I know when the planets a line

And it's love beyond the sky, oh baby oh
When heaven and earth collide
It's love beyond the sky, the sky, the sky

It's love beyond the sky
