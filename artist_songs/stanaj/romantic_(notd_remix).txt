You say I make you shy
I don't know why
Every time we kiss
It gets better every time
(Yeah)
Underneath the lights
You shining so bright
Tension in the air
You could cut it with a knife
See, I'm just tryna' be somebody
You can be in love so deep
No I don't gotta do these things

But you make me
You make me wanna be romantic
You make me wanna be a star
You make me wanna act different
I love you for who ya are
You make me wanna run circles around ya
So glad that I found ya
You make me wanna be romantic
You make me wanna be a star
You make me wanna be romantic...

Have you got the time?
We can do dinner and wine
I can compliment you
But that would take all night
See, I'm just tryna' be somebody
You can be in love so deep
No I don't gotta do these things

But you make me
You make me wanna be romantic
You make me wanna be a star
You make me wanna act different
I love you for who ya are
You make me wanna run circles around ya
So glad that I found ya
You make me wanna be romantic
You make me wanna be a star
You make me wanna be romantic

You make me wanna be romantic
You make me wanna be a star
You make me wanna be different
I love you for who ya are
You make me wanna do circles around ya
So glad that I found ya
I just wanna be romantic

I just wanna be a star
Make me wanna be romantic...

Make me do things I never seem to do
Never said those 3 words but I say them to you
Make me wanna say things I never seem to say
Make me ask why am I always acting this way?

Make me do things I never seem to do
Never said those 3 words but I say them to you
Make me wanna say things I never seem to say
Make me ask why am I always acting this way?

You make me wanna be romantic
You make me wanna be a star
You make me wanna act different
I love you for who ya are
You make me wanna run circles around ya
So glad that I found ya
You make me wanna be romantic
You make me wanna be a star
