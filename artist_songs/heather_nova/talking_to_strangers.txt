I'm talking to strangers
To see what I feel;
Your face is changing now
And nothing seems real.
These things I know
Are like a baby how they grow in me;
I pull them out
Just like a baby for you to see them all

I'm talking to strangers
To see what I need;
This love between us now,
How it's twisting in me.
I want to get it out,
I want to feel the breathing,
I want to really love,
I want to know the meaning,
I want to share all these things.

These things I know
Are like a baby how they grow in me
I pull them out
Just like a baby for you to see them all
