Fire

So this is what it's coming to
Divided by the things we do
I see a light in the distance shining
I see your eyes and the pain that you bring

So this is just a rich girl's dream
No way to know the things you've seen
We're worlds apart but both flesh and blood
A change of heart could do us all some good

And we can the stop the fire
Yeah, we can turn this around

We got a long way to go
This much I know
But we can stop the fire

I'll listen if you speak to me
If you speak to me
And fly it for the world to see
If you speak to me
I don't pretend that I know how you feel
Easy for me but for you it's so real

And we can the stop the fire
Yeah, we can turn this around
Yeah, we can stop the fire, mm-mm
Yeah, we can turn this around

We got a long way to go
This much I know
But we can stop the fire

Fire
Fire

We got a long way to go
This much I know
But we can stop the fire
Fire

We got a long way to go
Stop it now
We got a long way to go
We can stop the fire, fire
We can stop the fire
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we can stop the fire
