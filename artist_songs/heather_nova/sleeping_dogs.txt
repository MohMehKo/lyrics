Winter's upon us now in all its grace and charm
Fire in the hearth, but will you keep me safe and warm?
The dogs are sleeping; they say let the sleeping dogs lie
But I say wake 'em up and see if they can fly

I want you to want me
Like the river wants the sea
I want you to want to
Roll downstream with me

I watch your face, the way it lights up to the sound
Of music, but do you still want me around?
The dreams you're living in, in your darkest hour
Like the scent of jasmine, now they've got you in their power

I want you to want me
Like the river wants the sea
I want you to want to
Roll downstream with me

We were young with our hair all hanging down
Riding the night bus through the grit and glitter of the town
Now the dogs are sleeping; they say let the sleeping dogs lie
But I say wake 'em up and see if they can fly

I want you to want me
Like the river (like the river)
Wants the sea (wants the sea)
I want you to want to
Roll downstream with me
Roll downstream with me
