I saw the redbird fly
bright flame against the sky
burning against the sun,
am I the only one?

I watched the rose unfold
Secrets we left untold
The rose, the red red rose,
still nobody knows

I split the pomegranate
Restless until you've had it
Sweet against the tongue, am I the only one?

The blood red rubies of... Our sexuality
