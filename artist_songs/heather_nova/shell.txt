Look at me I'm smooth like a shell,
Put your head down
You can hear the ocean.
Hold my body - feel it roll,
So much inside and it's all been broken.

You know it's just one step out it could all be over
You know this could rip us out at the seams.

I'm falling; it's all in your hands,
Don't let it wash away.
I'm aching; don't take it all away,
Breaking the shell again.

Look at me I'm out on the edge,
Put your hand here
See I'm bleeding.
I can't get it, get the light out -
I can't seem to tear out the feeling.

You know it's just one step out it could all be over
You know this could rip us out at the seams.

I'm falling; it's all in your hands,
Don't let it wash away.
I'm aching; don't take it all away,
Breaking the shell again.

I am a box, I am a fish, I am a trail, I keep you warm,
And I remember stripping down to meet the water,
Wading out to where the sky turns under,
My insides smooth like a shell,
Like a shell ...
