If I should die and leave you here, just disappear
I know the sun will still shine
The day I'm gone, you'll carry on and on and on
And I know the sun will still shine

And if you wanna reach me
Just feel the sun in your face
And if you wanna hear me
Just sing out with your own voice

Life in each hour is delicate
As a jasmine flower in my hands
Just for this time
To kiss your face, to hold you now
To feel this grace
Just for this time

And if you wanna reach me
Just feel the sun in your face
And if you wanna hear me
Just sing out with your own voice

Cause I will always, I will always
I will always be a part of you
And love will always, love will always
Love will always, love will get you through

Yeah, I will always, I will always
I will always be a part of you
And love will always, love will always
Love will always, love will get you through
