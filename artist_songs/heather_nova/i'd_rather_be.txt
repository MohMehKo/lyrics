I'd rather be warm than tough and cool

I'd rather be warm than tough and cool
I'd rather be true
I'd rather by soft than hard as steel
I'd rather be real
I'd rather live close to the ground
Than fly at the speed of sound
I'd rather free fall and feel it all

And if you want me, you gotta take me
As I am
There's no one like me, so celebrate me
As I am
As I am

I'd rather see life with open eyes
Than wear some know-it-all disguise
I'd rather be small, observe it all
A little unsure
I'd rather speak truth with every word
Or hold my tongue and not be heard
I'd rather live full and feel the fear

And if you want me, you gotta take me
As I am
There's no one like me, so celebrate me
As I am
As I am

‘Cause we win and we lose
And we feel and we bruise
And we're not perfect
But that's how I'd rather be

And we give and we take
And we fall and we break
And we're not perfect
But that's how I'd rather be

I'd rather be, I'd rather be, I'd rather be, I'd rather be
I'd rather be, I'd rather be, I'd rather be, I'd rather be
Let my hair down, make a big sound, let it all around
I'd rather be, I'd rather be, I'd rather be
I'd rather be
I'd rather be loved than held above

And if you want me, you gotta take me
As I am
There's no one like me, so celebrate me
As I am
As I am

‘Cause we win and we lose
And we feel and we bruise
And we're not perfect
But that's how I'd rather be

And we give and we take
And we fall and we break
And we're not perfect
But that's how I'd rather be

And we laugh and we cry
And we love and we die
And we're not perfect
But that's how I'd rather be

And we climb and we fall
And we mess with it all
We're not perfect
Not perfect, but that's how I'd rather be

I'd rather be, I'd rather be, I'd rather be, I'd rather be
I'd rather be, I'd rather be, I'd rather be, I'd rather be

I'd rather be, I'd rather be, I'd rather be, I'd rather be
I'd rather be, I'd rather be, I'd rather be
I'd rather be, I'd rather be
I'd rather be, I'd rather be, I'd rather be me
