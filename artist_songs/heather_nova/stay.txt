This is our reason to be
Alone on an island at sea
Watching the tide roll away
It makes me wanna stay

Sweet is the oleander breeze
Calling the bluebirds in the trees
Soft are the clouds when evening comes
To calm the burning sun down

And are you gonna stay with me
Are you gonna stay
Throw the anchor out with me
To the shore
Are you gonna stay

And when you wake, you dive below
Scatter the seeds and watch them grow
Living in touch and out of time
We leave the world behind

And are you gonna stay with me
Are you gonna stay
And throw the anchor out with me
To the shore

‘Cause this is where I wanna be
Surrounded by the sky and sea
And this is what I want
Nothing more

Living in touch and out of time
We leave the world behind

And are you gonna stay with me
Are you gonna stay
And throw the anchor out with me
To the shore

‘Cause this is where I want to be, I want to be
Surrounded by the sky and sea
So honey, take a chance on this, take a chance on me
And throw the anchor out

“Cause this is where I wanna be
Beside you on this shore
This is what I want
Nothing more
