When you touch me, I feel lonely
I don't know how to let you into me
It's been coming now for a long time
It's been coming now for a long time

Is there some way to reach my Hebrides
Burn a light on the headland, lonely seas
We've been rolling on for a long time
We've been rolling on for a long time

Oh maybe tomorrow the sun will shine
Oh maybe the wild rose will be all mine to give you
Oh maybe soon

I've been out on the birdland, got no wings
I've been calling the nighthawk, hope she sings
It's been coming now for a long time
It's been coming now for a long time

Oh maybe tomorrow the sun will shine
Oh maybe the wild rose will be all mine to give you
Oh maybe tomorrow the sun will shine
Oh maybe the wild rose will be all mine to give you
Oh maybe soon, oh maybe soon
