Simplicity, is what we need
And I know it in my heart
So many choices make us think we need
What we haven't got

I've been blessed, by you
I've been tested, by an angel
I've been blessed, by you
And I know and I believe
There's a way out to the sea of happiness

And if I knew what Buddha taught
And would my wings unfold
And if I had all that I want
Could I let it go

I've been blessed, by you
I've been tested, by an angel
I've been blessed, by you
And I know and I believe
There's a way out to the sea of happiness

And sometimes I feel I'm learning to crawl
Like I'm still learning how to love
And sometimes I feel like I'm losing it all
But I know there must be some way we can rise above

I've been blessed, by you
I've been tested, by an angel
I've been blessed, by you
And I know and I believe
There's a way out to the sea of happiness
And I know and I believe
And I know and I believe
And I know and I believe
