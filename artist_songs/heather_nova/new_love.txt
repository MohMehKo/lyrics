There's a barge going by on the river,
Yellow against the blue.
There's a bus driving up along the bridge,
And it's red like the color of new love.

And I need new love
And I need true love
And I need to be held
And I need to be told
There's more to come.

There's a woman beside a window,
Quiet against the street.
There's a man beside a magazine stand,
Looks like he's waiting to meet some one.

And I need new love
And I need true love
And I need to be held
And I need to be told
There's more to come.

And everything reminds me of you
And everything reminds me of things we used to do
Even though I miss you, I know we're through
And I need to find something new

And I need new love
And I need true love
And I need to be held
And I need to be told
There's more to come.

There's a man playing guitar in the subway,
Gentle against the crowd.
There's a kid in the upstairs apartment,
plays his recorder, wakes me up from above.

And I need new love
And I need true love
And I need to be held
And I need to be told
There's more to come.
