You tell me that you need me, then you walk away
The words inside my head are not the things I say
The grass all wet with dew, the light reflecting me in you
But still we cannot see

This humanness in us
Can we take it, can we make it
Something beautiful to touch?
Is there life beyond the sky?
Does it matter if we fly?
Or is it enough to be
Simply as we are?

We are this humanness is us

And some would chase the dragon when they're feeling weak
And others hide in silence when they long to speak
The shame is just the pain, carried all these years
Lodged within the tender heart

This humanness in us
Can we take it, can we make it
Something beautiful to touch?
Is there life beyond the sky?
Does it matter if we fly?
Or is it enough to be
Simply as we are?

We are this humanness
This crazy mess
I love this humanness in us

I walk along the shore to feel the biting wind
I know that I want more, I want you to let me in
The shores outside the waves, the deeper blue
I long to find the depths of you

This humanness in us
Can we take it, can we make it
Something beautiful to touch?
Is there life beyond the sky?
Does it matter if we fly?
Or is it enough to be
Simply as we are?

This humanness in us
Can we take it, can we make it
Something beautiful to touch?
Is there life beyond the sky?
Does it matter if we fly?
Or is it enough to be
Simply as we are?

We are this humanness
This crazy mess
I love this humanness
This crazy mess, this humanness
This fucked-up crazy mess
This humanness of us
