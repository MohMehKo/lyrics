Are you ready
For me to be stronger
I'm keeping my distance
My voice to a whisper
Are you ready
For me to surrender
Cause I find in my return
There's no need to hide these words

Cause maybe, maybe, I'm no angel, I'm no angel
But I feel, like I could fly
And maybe, maybe, there's no rainbow, there's no rainbow
But my love for you still shines

And I want to, I wanna be endless
I wanna be helpless
I want to be true
Like a sunbeam, like a sunbeam
The shadow's behind me, the shadow's behind me
Sliding out of view
Let me bring it home to you

Maybe, maybe, I'm no angel, I'm no angel
But I feel, like I could fly
Maybe, maybe, there's no rainbow, there's no rainbow
But my love for you still shines

Cause here I am, here I am
I've been running, long enough to know
Here I am, here I stand
All this rung's got me longing in my soul
Longing in my soul

Cause maybe, maybe, I'm no angel, I'm no angel
But I feel, like I could fly
Maybe, maybe, there's no rainbow, there's no rainbow
But my love for you still shines

Yeah maybe, maybe, I'm no angel, I'm no angel
Angel feel, feel like I could fly
Yeah, maybe, maybe, there's no rainbow, there's no rainbow
But my love, love for you still shines
My love still shines
