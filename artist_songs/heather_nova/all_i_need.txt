Can we love each other?
And respect each other?
Find some joy together?

That's all I need
All I need
That's all I need

I don't want your money
Or all your time
Just a heart that's beating
With mine

That's all I need
All I need
That's all I need

And when you've got the world on your shoulders, you'll see
I'll be there for you like you'll be there for me

Cuz that's all I need...
