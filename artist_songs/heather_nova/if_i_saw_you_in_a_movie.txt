Sweet, won't let you go
Sweet, won't let you go
I got an e-mail from you today
With a poem that you wrote
I was touched because you felt it
And 'cause I nearly let you go

Sweet, won't let you go
Sweet, won't let you go

This long distance has me outta my mind
But it gives me time to think
And it gives me room to see you
In another live

Sweet, won't let you go
Sweet, won't let you go
Sweet, won't let you go, won't let you go
Sweet, won't let you go

And I know if I saw you in a movie
And I know, doing all the things you do, for me
And I know if I saw you in a movie
Doing all the things you do
I would fall in love with you

Sweet, won't let you go, won't let you go
Sweet, won't let you go

And I know if I saw you in a movie
And I know, doing all the things you do, for me
And I know if I saw you in a movie
Doing all the things you do
I would fall in love with you

Sweet, won't let you go, won't let you go
Sweet, won't let you go
Sweet, won't let you go, won't let you go

Sweet, won't let you go, won't let you go
