It gets inside you like the sun,
It makes you wet just like the rain
It makes you sound so sentimental,
It's a lovely kind of pain.

I used to dream,
I used to dream about Verona.
I used to dream, dream,
I used to dream about Verona.

And if there ever was an earthquake,
I'd go down in the earth with you.
And if there ever was an avalanche,
I'd landslide down with you.

I used to dream,
I used to dream about Verona.
I used to dream.
I used to lean over the side of the boat
And get hypnotized by the water and dream.

It's up in the trees it's up to me.
It's out of the blue, out to you.

I used to dream,
I used to dream about Verona.

Yeah Romeo you are priceless, lifeless,
Skipping star to scar to star.
I used to dream you'd be slipping, slipping from me.
Burning, breathing, breathing, sleeping, in me.
I used to lean over the side of the boat
And get hypnotized by the water and dream.
Slipping, slipping, slipping,
Slipping from me.
Burning, burning, breathing,
Sleeping in me.
