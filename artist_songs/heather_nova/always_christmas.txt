Christmas is coming
Like a road I'm running
All the lights reminding me
There's something more I've got to give

Bells are ringing
In my head, I'm singing
Still I can't begin to feel the light
That I was meant to live

All of the places that I used to know
The million faces passing by
And you and I, we still have far to go

It's always, it's always, it's always Christmas
When I feel this way
It's always, it's always, it's always Christmas
When I feel this way

The night is silent
How the stars are vibrant
And I wish the world was peaceful
As it seems it is tonight

So hang the mistletoe
And kiss the one below
But pray the angels come
And bring this world a little light

All of the places that I used to know
The million faces passing by
And you and I, we still have far to go

It's always, it's always, it's always Christmas
When I feel this way
It's always, it's always, always Christmas
When I feel this way

All of the places that I used to know
The million faces passing by
And you and I, we still have far to go

It's always, it's always, it's always Christmas
When I feel this way
It's always, it's always, always Christmas
When I feel this way

It's always, it's always, always Christmas
When I feel this way
