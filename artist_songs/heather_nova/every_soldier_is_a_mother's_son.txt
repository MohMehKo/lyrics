I keep a light in the window
Dark band on my heart
Some days are better than others
Mostly I'm falling apart

I keep his picture beside me
I see the dream in his eyes
I watch the light disappearing
Into unsettled skies

You say the world will be a better place
After this war is won
You say no sacrifice too great
But every soldier is a mother's son

I know he can't take the killing
And how it messes with his soul
I know the days are unending
When you're so far from home

You say the world will be a better place
After this war is won
You say no sacrifice too great
But every soldier is a mother's son

You say the world will be a better place
After this war is won
You say no sacrifice too great
But every soldier is a mother's son

No war that can be won
When every soldier is a mother's son
No war that can be won
When every soldier is a mother's son

I keep a light in the window
I keep a vigil inside
I say a prayer for those mothers
Across the enemy lines

You say the world will be a better place
After this war is won
You say no sacrifice too great
But every soldier is a mother's son

You say the world will be a better place
After this war is won
You say no sacrifice too great
But every soldier is a mother's son

Every soldier is a mother's son
Every soldier is a mother's son
