When I feel life's beauty weigh on me now
It's like a dream but too real somehow

Precious thing, you are the world to me now
Precious thing, you hold the key to me now

Oh God, thank God, you're home
I've been worried sick
I could come undone
Thinking only of it

And I feel life's beauty weigh on me now
It's like a dream but too real somehow

Precious thing, you are the world to me now
Precious thing, you hold the key to me now

If life is meant to teach
Will I ever make the grade
My grasp's so out of reach
Brighter, then I tend to fade

And I feel life's bleeding as we love
We're only human, then it's, oh, dust to dust

Precious thing, you are the world to me now
Precious thing, precious thing, you hold the key to me now
Precious thing

And I feel life's beauty weigh on me now
It's like a dream but too real somehow

Precious thing, you are the world to me now
Precious thing, you hold the key to me now

Precious thing, precious thing, can't take the feel from me now
Precious thing
Forever
