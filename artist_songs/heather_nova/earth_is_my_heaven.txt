Got a feeling that the joy
Is rising in the clear blue
Got a feeling that the joy
Is coming through

And let the clouds fly high above me
And let the sea, sea roll in
Cause this will be my, be my heaven
That we're living in

Years of flying over
Now I'm coming in to land
See you standing at the edge of summer
Holding out your hands

Let the clouds fly high above me, yeah
And let the sea, the sea roll in
Cause this will be my, be my, be my heaven
That we're living in

I say the earth is my heaven, we're living in
Earth is my heaven, heaven
Heaven, hea-, hea-, hea-, heaven
Ooo-yeah

Let the clouds fly high above me, yeah
And let the sea, the sea roll in
Cause this will, this will be, be my heaven
That we're living in

We're living in heaven
We're living in heaven
Earth is my heaven, earth is my heaven, mmm
Earth is my heaven, heaven
Heav-, heav-, heav-, heav-, heaven

This earth is heaven
This earth, my heav-, heaven
Hea-, hea-, heaven

It's all I need
