Tonight my life is moving fast
I sit and watch the demons pass
A world I know but never seen
A fear that ripped the colour from me

I lit a candle for the day
Saw the light around your head
Walked where angels never go
Saw them shining from below

It's easy when you're blessed
With money, love and sex
You're not like all the rest
It's easy when you're blessed

And did your mother lie to you?
You got God and death confused
I can't blame it on your soul
There was nowhere else it could go

It's easy when you're blessed
With money, love and sex
You're not like all the rest
It's easy when you're blessed
It's easy when you're blessed
