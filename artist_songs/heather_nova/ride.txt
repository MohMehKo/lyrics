I don't know if I took a wrong turn
Cause the birds don't fly low like they used to
The water's rising but I'm bone dry
And I don't come for you like I used to

And I need a stranger to tell me I'm beautiful
I wanna hold onto nothing and ride
Like the cinnamon girl
Like a butterfly
Just hold onto nothing
And ride

Well sometimes I'm hungry for the warmth of a body
Like a flame that could feed me or keep me alive
I done the right thing but I'm incomplete
I need something to explode inside

And I need a stranger to tell me I'm beautiful
I wanna hold onto nothing and ride
Like the cinnamon girl
Like a butterfly
Just hold onto nothing
And ride
Hold onto nothing
And ride

Onto Georgia O'Keeffe's skies
Over red earth plains
Where the desert raven flies
Where the truth remains

Let me ride
Yeah
Ride, ride

'Cause I need a stranger to tell me I'm beautiful
I wanna hold onto nothing and ride
Like the cinnamon girl
Like a butterfly
Just hold onto nothing

And I need a stranger to tell me I'm beautiful
I wanna hold onto nothing and ride
Like the cinnamon girl
Like a butterfly
Hold onto nothing

Yeah, I need a stranger to tell me I'm beautiful
I wanna hold onto nothing and nothing and nothing
Yeah, hold onto nothing
And ride
Hold onto nothing
And ride
Hold onto nothing
