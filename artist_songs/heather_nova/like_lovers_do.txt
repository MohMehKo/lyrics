There is a paradise that can be found
A better life to bring us round
And all we really need to do
Is see the world like lovers do

I want to take it easy, take it slow
To catch a fire and let it go
I wanna give myself to you
So we can live like lovers do

Like lovers do
I wanna feel that way
Yeah like lovers do
They loose themselves for days
And I need to feel, I need to feel that way

I can hear you thinking what I feel
I know that what we've got is real
And all we need to get us through
Is just to live like lovers do

Just like lovers do
I wanna feel that way
Yeah like lovers do
They loose themselves for days
Yeah I need to feel, I need to feel that way
Like lovers do
Give me the strength
To give myself to you
Like lovers lovers do

Yeah all we really need to do
Is see the world like lovers do
Like lovers do
I wanna feel that way
Yeah like lovers do
They loose themselves for days
Lovers do
