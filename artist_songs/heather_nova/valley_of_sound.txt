Move me
Don't try
Let the music reach me tonight
Push me into something new
I've been riding all day on a bus
Just to listen to you

I love, I love, I love the look
In your trespassed eyes
I love, I love, I love the way
You can make me cry

Sink me into stirred-up sea
Something I can drown in
Only you can do this to me

I love, I love, I love the look
In your trespassed eyes
I love, I love, I love the way
You can make me cry

Fill me up
And drop me down
Now I'm alive in the valley of sound
In the valley of sound
The valley of sound
