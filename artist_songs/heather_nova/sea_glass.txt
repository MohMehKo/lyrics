I wasn't sure what to say
Big ocean wave came rolling in that day
All the way it came from Africa
A deeper blue I never saw
And all the things that I forgot that I could feel

And I wasn't sure what to give
Truth can be hard to swallow but that's the way I live
I often am misunderstood
Make a mess of things
When I search for good
I walk right in when I know I should just walk away

Give me a reason, give me a rhyme
Bury it deep in the sands of time
Tell me I'm wrong or that I'm insane
I'm looking for truth, not someone to blame
All I want is to live as clear as Sea Glass

Now that I'm standing in the sand
Got all these pretty pieces sifting through my hands
I'll pick them up and I'll let 'em go
Let the water in, I'll let it flow
So many things I'll never know, I'll never know

Give me a reason, give me a rhyme
Bury it deep in the sands of time
Tell me I'm wrong or that I'm insane
I'm looking for truth, not someone to blame
All I want is to live as clear as Sea Glass
Sea Glass

Now I'm standing on the shore of the Atlantic
With these seeds of love I've planted
Under this majestic sky, why do I still wonder why?
All my hopes and indecisions, clouds that shimmer in the distance
Why do I still wonder why? Why?

So give me a reason, give me a rhyme
Bury it deep in the sands of time
Tell me I'm wrong or that I'm insane
I'm looking for truth, not someone to blame
All I want is to live as clear as Sea Glass
Sea Glass
As clear as Sea Glass
As clear as Sea Glass
