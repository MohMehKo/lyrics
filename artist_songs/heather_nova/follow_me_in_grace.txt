Dive in to a life
Fall in to the green
Out with my breath
Bursting unseen

Cradle you rock
Hold me in the deep
We all are lost
Searching and free

And to the little hearts
Hardly spoken
And to the wild hearts
Always fierce

Life, I don't know your ways
Life, follow me in grace

Crack in my voice
Where did you go
We've got no choice
Chariots swing low

And to the little hearts
Hardly spoken
And to the wild hearts
Always fierce

Life, I don't know your ways
Life, follow me in grace

Life, I don't know your ways
I will make mistakes
So follow me in grace
So follow me in grace
So follow me in grace
