Your hands were covered in paint
The pillow smothered my cry
You were half charmer half snake
I lived in dreamtime

But I'm alive; I survived you
And the bitter taste, the years I wasted
All the hate is gone
'Cause I'm Alive

Some nights I'd sleep in the car
Just to escape you
You drove devotion too far
No-one could save you

But I'm alive; I survived you
And the bitter taste, the years I wasted
All the hate is gone
'Cause I'm Alive

I still have visions of you
I still have nights to get through
And when the trust isn't true
I have these visions of you, visions of you

But I'm alive; I survived you
And the bitter taste, the years I wasted
All the hate is gone cause I'm alive
Ride on and fade away
There's nothing more to say
Ride on and fade away
There's nothing more to say
