Can you hear me
Am I loud enough
Could you see it coming
Like an avalanche
I only felt the need

When somebody turns you on
It's like a light in the dark goes on
It's like you've waited for rain, you're waited
So long
When somebody turns you on

Were you waiting, were you waiting
When you took my hand
Were you aching with me
Did you understand
I only felt the heat

When somebody turns you on
It's like a light in the dark goes on
It's like you've waited for rain, you're waited
So long
When somebody turns you on

When I know this is real
I know, 'cause I know, 'cause I feel
You eyes go straight to my soul
And I know this is good
It goes deep like I know it should yeah
We've just got to let love grow

When somebody turns you on
It's like a light in the dark goes on
It's like you've waited for rain, you're waited
So long
When somebody turns you on

When somebody turns you on
It's like a light in the dark goes on
It's like you've waited for rain, you're waited
So long
When somebody turns you on

When somebody turns you on, when somebody turns you on
When somebody turns you on, when somebody turns you on
When somebody turns you on, when somebody turns you on
When somebody turns you on, when somebody turns you on
When somebody turns you on, when somebody turns you on
When somebody turns you on, when somebody turns you on
When somebody turns you on, when somebody turns you on
When somebody turns you on, when somebody turns you on
