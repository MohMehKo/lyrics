One day in june, I slipped away
Called by desire, drawn to the flame
My virtues disappeared
Light on my feet
Whispers as sweet as honey calling to me

One day in june
One day in june
I felt the hunger, I ate the fruit
One day in june

So don't cry for me
I had my chance;
I took a risk - I asked the wind to dance
Don't try to save me; I'm already gone
Everything's over
But I'm burning on

One day in june
One day in june
I felt the hunger, I ate the fruit
One day in june

Oh and I don't like how it feels to tell all these little lies
Try to be the one you can count on, but it's a thin disguise
I kissed it all goodbye
One day in june
