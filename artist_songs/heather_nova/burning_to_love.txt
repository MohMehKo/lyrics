I saw the young man standing, arms across his chest
He was afraid to speak the words that put his coolness to the test
But then he rose above and spoke of love and all that he had found
And he brought us all to tears like bringing rain back to he ground

â€˜Cause we're all burning, we're burning to love
We're burning, we're burning to love
We're learning that all we want and all we need
Is love
We're burning to love

I felt the mother's loss, her sadness and her pain
As she stood beneath the cedars, she was whispering his name
The life that breathes us is fleeting as a song
When we fly, we leave each other with empty, aching arms

That leaves us burning, burning to love
We're burning, burning to love
We're learning that all we want and all we need
Is love
We're burning to love

Love

So will you help me wear my heart out on my sleeve
Bring the alter to my doorstep, I'm already on my knees
Yeah

Yeah, I'm burning, burning to love
I'm burning, burning to love
I'm learning that all I want and all I need
Is love
I'm burning to love

Oh yeah, I'm burning, burning to love
I'm burning, burning to love
I'm learning, I'm learning that all we need
Is love

Love
Burning to love
