I want to live where the sky is big
Simple and free
That's where I want to be
Simple and free
That's where I gotta be

Take my clothes off
Be the one I am
In my own rhythm
Like the water

Simple and free
That's where I gotta be

Just living day to day to day to day
Just living day to day to day to day

Like a cherry seed
Let me learn to bleed
Breaking open
Like the sun

Just living day to day to day to day
Just living day to day to day to day to day
