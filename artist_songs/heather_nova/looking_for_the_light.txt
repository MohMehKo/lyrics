I'm looking for the spirit in life
I'm looking for the beautiful
I'm looking for the sweetness
Let my heart be full

I seen the face of Buddha
I seen the face of time
I've heard the words of Jesus
But I can't find mine

I'm looking for the light
I'm looking for the light
I'm looking for the light
To light my way

I wanna hold it to me
I wanna catch the glow
I think I'm getting higher
Then I fall below

I find it in the skies sometimes
I find it in the dark sometimes
I find it in my mind sometimes
But I can't hold on

I'm looking for the light
I'm looking for the light
I'm looking for the light
To light my way

I'm looking for the light
I'm looking for the light
I'm looking for the light
To drive these doubts away
