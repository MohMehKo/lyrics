I know how the winter takes you down
All of the colours gone to ground
White out, white out, it's hard to see
But you've got the courage buried deep
Hang on, I'm gonna get there

Know, I know it's hard to see it now
But every little thing, every little thing will be good again
Stars come out, they'll light your way
And you're gonna be that girl on the mountain
Every little thing, every little thing will be good again
Wind is strong, but don't you sway
Cause you're gonna be that girl on the mountain top

You gave the little bird her wings
That strength you called on is the reason she sings
Now is the hardest time of all
Gonna hurt no matter how you fall
But you'll be flying in the spring

And oh, I know it's hard to see it now
But every little thing, every little thing will be good again
Stars come out, they'll light your way
And you're gonna be that girl on the mountain
Every little thing, every little thing will be good again
Wind is strong, but don't you sway
Cause you're gonna be that girl on the mountain top

Oh, I know it's hard to see it now
Oh, I know it's hard
But every little thing, every little thing will be good again
Stars come out, they'll light your way
And you're gonna be that girl on the mountain
Every little thing, every little thing will be good again
Wind is strong, but don't you sway
Cause you're gonna be that girl on the mountain top

(Girl on the mountain)
(Too late to come back)
(Yeah)
