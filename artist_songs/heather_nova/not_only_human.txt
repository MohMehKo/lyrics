Morning is almost here - let it wait
I just want to lie here awhile, tempting fate
I don't think I could breathe now with you gone
But it's not weakness it's just something I've begun

Maybe there's a light that's always on
Maybe we're not only human
Maybe there's a light that's always on
And we're not only human

When you're sleeping your ceramic
You're surrounded by little stars
Every shimmer is a searchlight
Every planet is ours
Change the street change the decade
Still the longing's left inside
But why am I too small to carry you?
Why does twilight make me cry?

[chorus]
When all the weight is gone
When all is said and done
We're not only human

Life is something set to music
I can hear it when I'm sad
There's a chord in every muscle
Every kiss you ever had
There's a power when you're near me
In our heads or in our bones
I know nothing but I'm guessing
When we die we're not alone
