How many days are left
And what to spend them on?
Should I keep working
Or sit and marvel at the sky?
I think about your skin, your fragile skin
The heaven of life we're living in

Drink it in, drink it deep
I pray to life your soul to keep
Drink it in, drink it in

Pink clouds scatter
My heart beats clear
For all the hearts that I hold dear

Drink it in, drink it deep
I pray to life, your soul to keep
Drink it in, drink it in
Drink it in, drink it in
