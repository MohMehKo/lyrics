I'm swimming over rooftops
I'm looking through sea
This home I used to live in
The way things used to be

I'm breathing underwater
I hear my mother's voice
I'm back there in the blue swing
Back when there was a choice

I'll save a little piece of tomorrow
For you, child
I'll save a little piece of tomorrow

I'll save a little piece of tomorrow
For you, child
I'll carry this weight

I'm floating through the silence,
The shadows, and the sand
We held it like an hourglass
The world was in our hands

I'll save a little piece of tomorrow
For you, child
I'll save a little piece of tomorrow

I'll save a little piece of tomorrow
For you, child
I'll carry this weight on my shoulders
I'll carry this weight on my conscience
I'll carry this weight

I'll save a little piece of tomorrow
For you, child
I'll save a little piece of tomorrow

I'll save a little piece of tomorrow
For you, child
I'll carry this weight on my shoulders
I'll carry this weight on my conscience
I'll carry this weight, oh

I'll save a little piece of tomorrow
For you, Child
I'll save a little piece of tomorrow

I'll save a little piece of tomorrow
Oh, yeah yeah yeah
I'll save a little piece of tomorrow, oh
