I got my daddy's eyes
But you gave me your double vision,
I got my daddy's stride
Now I'm walking blind with double vision.

And I can almost see your face now, in me.
And I can almost feel the weight you carried.

You had to break the skin
To put the blood between us,
You did the dirty work
To put the blood between us.

And I can almost see your face now, in me.
And I can almost feel the weight you carried.

Oooh rocking the seed in me
Learning to speak the mothertongue.

Sometimes between the lines
I crashed, I could've killed you
I tried to go too fast -
I crashed, I could've killed you.

And I can almost see your face now, in me
And I can almost feel the weight you carried.

Oooh rocking the seed in me
Learning to speak the mothertongue.
