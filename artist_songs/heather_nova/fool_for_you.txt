You came into my life, I don't think that you meant to
You were standing in a doorway I was trying to walk through
Like an angel or the devil, I could never quite say
It doesn't matter anyway

Cuz I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool for you
Open my heart and let the wind blow through
I'm a fool for you

Well you can tell me anything and I'll believe
Cuz when you keep me hanging it only feeds the dream
I'm never going to reach you - you're a distant shore
But you've still got me coming back for more

Cuz I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool for you
Open my heart and let the wind blow through
I'm a fool for you

Let the wind blow through 

Now the snow is falling; all the roads are gone
The earth keeps moving but I am moving on
I had so much to tell you, but no words to say
It doesn't matter anyway
