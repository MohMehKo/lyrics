I've got a memory a thousand years old
And I know secrets I've never been told
And I've got jewels I haven't found
And they'll return me to the ground

[chorus]

I'm the girl, I'm the girl, I'm the girl
You know me
I'm the girl, I'm the girl, I'm the girl

And I'm a siren; I'll wreck you on my shores
And I'm godiva; I'll call you back for more
And I'm medusa; and I'm your favourite doll
And I'm a georgia o'keefe
Hanging on your wall

[chorus]

I'm Joan of Arc, I'm the girl next door
I'm the mother and the daughter
Of the mother and the daughter before

And I remember being born just 
Sound and light and sound and light
And I remember the first time, 
Skin on skin in the arms of the night.
Well how many times have we looked
Up into the starry skies, and how many 
Times have we felt the passion rise.
Every ruby-lipped girl baby, old lady, squaw junkie, 
Girl after girl after girl, every muse, whore, 
Good witch, princess, back arching, year after year after year

[chorus]

I'm Joan of Arc, I'm the girl next door
I'm the mother and the daughter
Of the mother and the daughter before
