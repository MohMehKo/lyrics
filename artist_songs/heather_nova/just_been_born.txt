My heart opened, like an oyster shell
I drank salt water, from your lips
And just below the equator
I swallowed the pearl

And I feel, and I feel, and I feel like I've just been born

And the sea rolled in
And rose around us
Your face above me
Darkening the stars
And as the waves are breaking out along the reef
I dived for your heart

And I feel, and I feel, and I feel like I've just been born

Honey honey, yeah I want you
Honey honey, yeah I want you
Honey honey, yeah I want you
Want you yeah

Honey honey, yeah I want you
Honey honey, yeah I want you
Honey honey, yeah I want you
Want you

My heart opened, like an oyster shell
I drink salt water, from your lips
And just below the equator
I swallowed the pearl

And I feel, and I feel, and I feel like I've just been born

Honey honey, yeah I want you
Honey honey, yeah I want you
Honey honey, yeah I want you
want you yeah

Honey honey, yeah I want you
Honey honey, yeah I want you
Honey honey, yeah I want you

Honey honey, yeah
Honey honey, yeah
Honey honey

Honey honey, yeah
Honey honey, yeah
Honey honey
