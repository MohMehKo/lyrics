Why do I
Follow this heart of mine
Risk my life
Follow it every time

Ride the waves
Into the wild beyond
To bring you hope
That's what I'm riding on

It's what I see inside
I see in your eyes

I can pull you from the wreckage
I can save your life
I can bring you what you need
I can make it alright
But it's you who lifts me to higher ground
It's you who lifts me to higher ground

Why do I
Follow the call again
No one hears
But I can feel your pain

Worlds away
Everyone's looking through
Glory fades
But it's what I am to you

It's what I see inside
I see in your eyes

I can pull you from the wreckage
I can save your life
I can bring you what you need
I can make it alright
But it's you who lifts me to higher ground, yeah
It's you who lifts me to higher ground
It's you who
It's you who
It's you

I can pull you from the wreckage
I can save your life
I can bring you what you need
I can make it alright
But it's you who lifts me to higher ground, yeah
It's you who lifts me to higher ground

I can pull you from the wreckage
From the wreckage
I can save your life
I can bring you what you need
What you need
I can make it alright
But it's you who lifts me to higher ground, yeah you
It's you who lifts me to higher ground

Yeah, it's you who lifts me to higher ground
