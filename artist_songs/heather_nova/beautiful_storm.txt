There is a light that catches my eye in the morning
And I see it now
There aren't any saints, it dreams like it paints
It's a beautiful storm, it comes with no warning at all

I walk the line, tripping each time, and I stumble
But now that I'm half gone
The world's on the table, I'm willing and able
This beautiful storm, it comes with no warning at all

And you stand in the shadows
The room, dark and narrow
I bloom down to the marrow
It's a beautiful storm
It comes with no warning at all

Into the flesh
Into the sorrow I fall now
Waves coming on
And I'm soaked and I'm torn
I'm blissed out and worn
And this beautiful storm
It comes with no warning

And you stand in the shadows
The room, dark and narrow
I bloom down to the marrow
It's a beautiful storm
It comes with no warning

And I, how will I ever tell you that I want you
Oh how will I ever touch you like I long to
You just blow right through me

You stand in the shadows
The room, dark and narrow
I bloom down to the marrow
It's a beautiful storm
It comes with no warning

And you stand in the shadows
The room, dark and narrow
I bloom down to the marrow
It's a beautiful storm
It comes with no warning at all
