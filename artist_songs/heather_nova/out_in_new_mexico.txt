These walls around me and the days are long
I fill my lungs with a widow's song
I'm looking for a reason, feel the spirit rise
I see my life before me when I close my eyes

I picture a road out in New Mexico
Red earth and mountains and sky
I picture my soul out in New Mexico
With all that space rolling by

Sometimes I feel, in a world between
Everything I touch and everything I dream
Sometimes I long for the rose to bleed
For the spark to light in the depths of me

I picture a road out in New Mexico
Red earth and mountains and sky
I picture my soul out in New Mexico
With all that space rolling by

I'm so scared of what I'll find
If I let it go, if I look inside
I'm so scared of what I feel
If I let it go, if I make it real

I picture a road out in New Mexico
Red earth and mountains and sky
I picture my soul out in New Mexico
With all that space rolling by

With all that earth rolling by
With all these dreams rolling by
Leaving this life behind
