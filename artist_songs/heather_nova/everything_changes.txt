Last time you were here, I lost a baby
Nothing was clear, everything maybe
Songs I have sung deep in the silence
Nobody finds hope in defiance

Everything changes, changes for the good
Even the pain hurts like it should
Everything moves, shadows to light
Heart becomes whole when you give up the fight

Once a long time ago, you were a girl
Path undecided, sails unfurled
I could have known you then, followed you here
Swam in the lake with you, making it clear

Everything changes, changes for the good
Even the pain hurts like it should
Everything moves, shadows to light
Heart becomes whole when you give up the fight

I feel no hate
I feel no weight
I feel the truth
Of what it takes

I feel no hate
I feel no weight
I feel the truth
Of what it takes

You're lost in the silence now, deep in my heart
I'm starting again but I don't know how to start
Look out to the ocean, the green turns to blue
Crack in the sadness, the light filters through

Everything changes, changes for the good
Even the pain hurts like it should
Everything moves, shadows to light
Heart becomes whole when you give up the fight

Everything changes, changes for the good
Even the pain hurts like it should
Everything moves, shadows to light
Heart becomes whole when you give up the fight
