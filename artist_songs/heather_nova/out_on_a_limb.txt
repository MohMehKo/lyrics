I'm looking through to what this all comes down to
I'm looking for just a little more, a taste of happiness
This world keeps spinning me around, I can't see clearly
I got no way to find the ground and I've gotta move on

But what if I fall
What if I fail
What if I find I'm out on a limb
And what if I fly
What if I sail
What if I find that it's better than ever before

Red sky at night, you tell me there's good yet to come
I think I might find a little more, a taste of happiness
I've built these walls around myself, I can't see over
And all these lines I tell myself, so I don't have to try

Cause what if I fall
What if I fail
What if I find I'm out on a limb
And what if I fly
What if I sail
What if I find that it's better than ever before

Cause what if I fall
What if I fail
What if I find I'm out on a limb
And what if I fly
What if I sail
What if I find that it's better than ever, yeah

What if I fall
What if I fail
What if I find I'm out on a limb
And what if I fly
What if I sail
What if I find that it's better than ever before
Better than ever before
Better than ever before
