What you give me is more than love
Where you take me is higher up than I'll ever go
The road brings me home when you're by my side
But the years are passing so fast I could cry

And I'll always know
That you were my baby
Someday you'll grow
But I'll hold onto these memories
These moon river days

What you give me is more than joy
Enough to live for, my darling boy
The bitter and sweet now, the courage you find
To stand on your own now, and leave me behind

But I'll always know
That you were my baby
Someday you'll grow up
But I'll hold onto these memories
These moon river days

Oh, you got a lot of roads to travel
And soon you're gonna need me no more

But I'll always know
That you were my baby
Someday you'll go
But I'll hold onto these memories
These moon river days

Someday you'll grow
But I'll hold onto these memories
Someday you'll go
But I'll hold onto these memories
These moon river days
