The leaves have turned and she has known
And she tells me she can't let him go
And she looks to the moon for answers
And she looks inside and she knows

She dresses by the window
Finds reflection in the pane
She looks towards the winter
And her hair falls around her like rain

She's sighing with September
She would like to run and hide
She's wrapped up in confusion
She unfolds like paper dolls
But she's flying as she falls

The birds have gone and she has known
For she follows the arc of their flight
And the softness has gone from the daylight
And the shadows have grown into night

She's sighing with September
She would like to run and hide
She's wrapped up in confusion
She unfolds like paper dolls
But she's flying as she falls

Soon will come cool October
It will rise all around her like fire
And she gathers her courage like harvest
And she gathers her thoughts and desires

She's sighing with September
She would like to run and hide
She's wrapped up in confusion
She unfolds like paper dolls
But she's flying as she falls

She will not run and hide
She will take it all in stride
And she will
She will
She will 
be flying as she falls
