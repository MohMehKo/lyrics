Out of the glitter and the shine,
Out of the corner of my eye,
Saw you walk in, I freezed the frame,
My luck again.
We could have been strangers if we tried
Moved to the rhythm side by side,
Maybe a glance across the room,
Blue moon

Why do the hours burn so long?
Sunset and shadows call,
I hear the music playing on
I know you're gone but you
You left me a song

Under the skylight after dark,
Crept in to find you, what a lark
We were like children stripping down,
The joy we found.
But even the lights that turn me on
Make it so hard to see beyond;
Make it a rainbow in my mind
- This borrowed time

Why do the hours burn so long?
Sunset and shadows call
I hear the music playing on
I know you're gone, but you
You left me a song
You left me a song 
You left me a song
