I think of Venus sinking down into the sea.
And what it is to be alone and have nothing.
I don't know why you want to leave this space between.
Is it easier to be alone and have nothing ?

You and me and everyone.
Throwing fire at the sun.

I put my hands up, lay my weapons down.
I know that I was stupid, I was wrong.

You and me and everyone.
Throwing fire at the sun.

If I listen there's something deeper that speaks.
If we reach out maybe we could make a little peace.

You and me and everyone.
Throwing fire at the sun.

Remember stealing oranges and how they bled.
And you're the one who showed me how to touch myself.

You and me and everyone.
Throwing fire at the sun.

Blood is a river, ties you to me.
Blood is a river, ties everyone.
Blood is a river, ties you to me.
Blood is a river, ties everyone.
