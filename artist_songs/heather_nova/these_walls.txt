In your heart there are oceans
In your heart there are flowering trees
Look inside and live inside these walls
Your body yearns

I'm not one to say I know what you go through
I only want to open wide the window and let sunlight through
For you

In your face I see longing
In your face I see hopes and fears
You've been locked for too long behind these walls
Your body yearns

I'm not one to say I know what you go through
I only want to open wide the window and let sunlight through
For you

Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
What you're feeling
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
What you need
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Everything

Take my hand and I'll lead you
Take my word that I'll not deceive you
I only want to carry you on beyond these walls
Your body yearns

I'm not one to say I know what you go through
I only want to open wide the window and let sunlight through
For you
