The streets are all busy
And we're still in bed
We should be up working
But we're lying here instead
I look outside, the weather's fine
For playing music, and drinking wine

I could waste the day with you
I could slip away
Into another dimension
What a perfect way, to spend the day, with you

Let's walk to the cafe
And sit in the sun
And read all the papers
And watch everyone
Cause life is short, and life is sweet
And sometimes you've just got to set yourself free

I could waste the day with you
I could slip away
Into another dimension
What a perfect way, to spend the day, with you

I could waste the day with you
I could slip away
Into another dimension
What a perfect way, to spend the day
Yeah what a perfect way, to spend the day, with you
