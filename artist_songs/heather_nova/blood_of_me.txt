Big ring around the moon
Gonna rain hard soon

I know you're gonna leave
It's like a storm inside

[chorus]

You're the blood of me
You're the truth that hurts
You're the memory
You're the drug that works

Why do people change
When hearts still beat the same ?

[chorus]

I don't believe you when you tell me
I don't believe you when you hold me
I don't believe you.You're my medicine
I don't believe you when you fuck me

[chorus]

Big ring around the moon
Gonna rain hard soon
