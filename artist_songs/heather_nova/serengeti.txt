We're on the great migration
I can feel the westward move
There's a quiver in the grasslands
There's a thundering of hooves

For all the time it's taken
For all the nights we've cried
We're on the great migration
Gonna leave it all behind

And all these thoughts and all these dreams
Running wild, alive in me
On our Serengeti

We can open up our big sky
And ride the Masai lands
We can strip away the ways we were
In the acacia and the sand

Cause the rains are gonna fall now
Quench our longing and our thirst
And the lion heart that left us
Gonna bring us back to earth

And all these thoughts and all these dreams
Running wild, alive in me
On our Serengeti
Our Serengeti
On our Serengeti

Well change has such a darkness
When you don't know it's what you need
And now we're in the open plains
I feel like I can see

Cause the birds are gonna fly now
Wildebeests are gonna run
We're on the great migration
Leaving shadows with the sun

And all these thoughts and all these dreams
Running wild, alive in me
Yeah, all, all these thoughts and all these dreams
Running wild, alive in me

On our Serengeti
On our Serengeti
Our Serengeti
Our
