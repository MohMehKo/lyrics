Now's the time when this will turn to fruit
All the poppies gonna push up through
And I can see the ground below
The places that I know, disappearing
And I can see the winter fade
I don't feel so afraid it's clearing

[chorus]

What a feeling, what a feeling
What a feeling

Life is only half way in our hands
Years have passed while I was making plans
And I could never find the words
I always felt absurd, and always outside
But now I know I shouldn't care
There's a song already there
Waiting inside

What a feeling, what a feeling, what a feeling

And I can feel the crock unwind
The parts of me I tied are running
And all the birds are in my head
The laughter that was dead is coming

What a feeling, what a feeling
The laughter that was dead is coming
What a feeling, what a feeling
The laughter that was dead is coming
