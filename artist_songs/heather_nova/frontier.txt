Sometimes I'm an indian
Caught only by the sky,
I can't go further -
I'm going inside.
See it's like a ride
It turns you out in the night;
You're far from the road now,
But it's getting brighter.

If you don't believe it
Then lose yourself and feel it;
This is the bright frontier
Right now, right here;
This is the bright frontier
Right now, right here.

Taking hold of what we have,
It's easy now;
We're splitting it open
To eat the seeds.
Looking in at what we've found,
It's easy now;
This big horizon,
It's you and me.

If you don't believe it
Then lose yourself and feel it;
This is the bright frontier
Where the love runs free;
This is the bright frontier
The sky is the limit for you and me.

When you get to the top of something
Do you get that feeling?
Do you get that high?
When you get to the top of something
Do you get there, you want to jump off?
Oh - we're going to keep on stretching out
We're going to ride on ...
