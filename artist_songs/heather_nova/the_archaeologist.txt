Every day is like Pompeii
Buried under ash and clay
Wishing we could push up, push up
Through to the air

Every little piece of us
Thinking of the way it was
Earth has gotta give way someday
Someone's gonna find our bones

So dig down, dig down we must
I'm not afraid of going deep
I'll be the archaeologist;
You just have to put your faith in me

Stay close, stay close we must
Hold up the light so we can see
I'll be the archeologist;
You just have to put your faith in me

See the sun is setting low
Coming through the olive groves
See the boy is running and running
No time to lose

Everything we hope to find
Everything preserved in time
Love is in the ruins, ruins
Come take my hand and

Dig down, dig down we must
I'm not afraid of going deep
I'll be the archaeologist;
You just have to put your faith in me

Stay close, stay close we must
Hold up the light so we can see
I'll be the archeologist;
You just have to put your faith in me

I've been dreaming, longing, waiting underground
I've been dreaming, longing, waiting to be found

So dig down, dig down we must
I'm not afraid of going deep
I'll be the archaeologist;
You just have to put your faith in me

Stay close, stay close we must
Hold up the light so we can see
I'll be the archeologist;
You just have to put your faith in me
You just have to put your faith in me
You just have to put your faith in me
You just have to put your faith in me
