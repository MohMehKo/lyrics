Love

I used to think that I knew what we needed
I just assumed we would always be fine
Now I don't think that we lost the feeling
But we, let everything build up inside

It's only love
But love, should make us strong
It's only love
But love, has been hurting so long

What a challenge, honesty
What a struggle to learn to speak
Who would've thought that pretending was easier

It's only love
But love, should make us strong
It's only love
But love, has been hurting so long

And it's all, a part of me
It tears at my heart
Only love
And it's all an eternity
Hoping to learn
Only love

Love

There's a part of you I'm trying to reach
Still a part I don't know
Tell me, is devotion a gift or a thief
Do you wish I'd let go

It's only love
But love, should make us strong
It's only love
But love, has been hurting so long

And it's all, a part of me
It tears at my heart
Only love
And it's all, eternity
Hoping to learn
Only love

Only love, only love
Only love, only love, only love, only
Only love, only love, only love, only love
Love, only love
