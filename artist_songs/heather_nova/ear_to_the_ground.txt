I've been wondering,
Waiting for something to give;
I won't be a heroine -
I'm just looking for something to live by.
And there are lesions in the soil
And there pockets of pain where the shadows lie,
And there are voices in the ocean,
And there is something in the sky.

A mother should say,
A father should say,
Oh you,
Look up, Look down,
Keep your ear to the ground.

It's washing over me
It's spinning under me
And am I looking up at the angels
Or am I really looking up at the clouds passing by?
And when I say I'm listening
Why is it I only hear you when you cry?

A mother should say,
A father should say,
Keep your ear to the ground
Keep your ear to the ground
Keep your ear to the ground.
