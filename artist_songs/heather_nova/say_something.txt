Say something, let it fly
Darkness is here and so am I
Say something, I don't care
Just let the words spill everywhere

And I'll just lie awake and watch the stars
There is no one can take this night of ours
Except for you, so get it through to me

Say something, I believe
There's still a chance for this to breathe
Say something, make it real
And risk it all, for what you feel

And I'll just lie awake and watch the stars
There is no one can take this night of ours
Except for you, so get it through to me

Your silence is not golden
Your words have not been stolen

No matter, in my head
I hear the words you never said

And I'll just lie awake and watch the stars
There is no one can take this night of ours
Except for you
