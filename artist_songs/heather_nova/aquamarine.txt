Aquamarine
All that glitters lies beneath
Deep blue, shallow green
I won't let it go

Aquamarine
You're my sexy little daydream
Deep blue, shallow green
Gotta make it so

Aquamarine
Send it up into the gulf stream
Deep blue, shallow green
I won't let it go

Now is the dream
Now is the dream
Aquamarine
