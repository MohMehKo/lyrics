Tried to reach you yesterday
To lie the lion down beside the lamb
Tried to find the words to say
I tried to put the white dove in your hands

I'm happy to take my turn
I'm happy to live and learn
I'm happy to let this slide
Till you come around

‘Cause it's a beautiful ride
As long as we're living
It's a beautiful ride
I don't mind if you're willing

‘Cause you and I
Circle in the same sky
You and I could fly side by side
On this beautiful ride

We're living with the tapestry
The energy of everything we've done
A little bit of you in me
A little bit of hope in everyone

I'm happy to make it right
I'm happy to stay all night
I'm happy to let this go
Until you come around

‘Cause it's a beautiful ride
As long as we're living
It's a beautiful ride
I don't mind if you're willing

‘Cause you and I
Circle in the same sky
You and I could fly side by side
On this beautiful ride

Yeah, you and I
Circle in the same sky
You and I could fly side by side
On this beautiful ride

It's a beautiful ride
As long as we're living
It's a beautiful ride
I don't mind if you're willing

It's a beautiful ride
Look out your window
It's a beautiful ride
It's a beautiful ride
Beautiful ride

It's a beautiful ride
As long as we're living
It's a beautiful ride
It's peace and forgiving
