Afternoon, heavy scented
Running golden
Standing by as you invented
My heart hovers

Tree house in the trees
Don't take this from me
I know the lesson coming:
Let go, let go

Afternoon, sweet as honey
I know I'm lucky when I see your face
My sunlit boy
Innocence still enjoyed

Tree house in the trees
Don't take this from me
I know the lesson coming:
Let go, let go

When you love
When you love
Then you can't
Keep your heart from breaking
Holding on (Holding on)
But I can't keep the tree from shaking

When you love
When you love
I just can't
Keep my heart from breaking
Holding on (Holding on)
But I can't keep the tree from shaking

Tree house in the trees
Don't take this from me
I know the lesson coming:
Let go, let go
Let go
