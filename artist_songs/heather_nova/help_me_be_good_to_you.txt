"Sometimes you remember the exact moment you wrote a song and this is one of them. I really was sitting in the light of late afternoon at the edge of the water, and the sentiment hit me. It seemed like such a simple line, I couldn't believe someone else hadn't written it already!"

Here in the light of late afternoon
Sun on the water, I'm thinking of you
How we've come too far
To be drifting apart
All this distance we're losing
I know it's my fault

But I think that I love you
I know that I do
I just need you
To help me, help me be good to you
Help me, help me be good to you
Help me, help me be good to you

I don't know why
I can't settle down
Something from my childhood
I still haven't found
And I don't wanna hurt you
With all my longings and my doubts
Just the way I need to feel free
I can see how it brings you down

Well I think that I love you
I know that I do
I just need you
To help me, help me be good to you
Help me, help me be good to you
Help me, please help me dad
Help me be good to you

Help me be good to you
Help me, help me be good to you
Help me, help me, help me, help me
Help me be good to you
Help me be good to you
Help me, help me be good to you
Help me, help me be good to you
