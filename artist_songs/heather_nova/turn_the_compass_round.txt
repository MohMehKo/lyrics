I've made my way, I've walked this world
I've tried to be a better girl
I've held my head up, held my own
Now all I wanna be is home

We sailed east in summer on the Azores High
For days I felt a silence in my soul
We headed south in winter to the trade winds
Like a heart beat, I could feel the ocean roll

My mother taught me how to be strong
My father showed me how to carry on

Now I turn the compass round
And head out on the ocean
I turn the compass round
And head out on the sea 

'Cause I've made my way, I've walked this world
I've tried to be a better girl
I've held my head up, held my own
Now all I wanna be is home

Sometimes I think I'm never gonna find
A sweetness that I knew when I was young
And in this faded photograph it seems
Like everything is shining in the sun

My mother taught me how to be free
My father showed me how to live the dream

Now I turn the compass round
And head out on the ocean
I turn the compass round
And head out on the sea

'Cause I've made my way, I've walked this world
I've tried to be a better girl
I've held my head up, held my own
Now all I wanna be is home
Is home, is home

I've made my way, I've walked this world
I've tried to be a better girl
I've held my head up, held my own
Now all I wanna be is home

I've made my way, I've walked this world
I've tried to be a better girl
I've held my head up, held my own
Now all I wanna be is home
Is home, is home
