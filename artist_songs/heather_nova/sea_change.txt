I live for the golden days
Between the winds and the driving rains
I live for the times you smiled
Between the grey and the lonely miles

I live for days like this
When there is no resistance

I go with the sea change, it changes so fast
A longing so strong and then it is past
I go with the sea change, it changes my mind
Leave all the things that don't matter behind

I live for the calling
The calling that whispers in my ear
The knowing that finds me
Between the doubts and the fear

I live for days like this
When we can close the distance

I go with the sea change, it changes so fast
A longing so strong, then it is past
I go with the sea change, it changes my mind
Leave all the things that don't matter behind

I live for now and here
Holding you close, my dear

I go with the sea change, it changes my mind
Leave all the things that don't matter behind

I go with the sea change
I go with the sea change
I go with the sea change
