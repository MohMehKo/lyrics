What do you need to be high, to be here
I catch your eye, now I'm lost in the tears
And it's hollow, but it's beautiful too
In the shadows, with the light coming through

Lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down

What do you need to be warm, to be real
I found a photograph of how we used to feel
And I'm drifting, but I'm riding it too
In the silence, with your voice coming through

Lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down

I wanna feel, wanna find what you are
Now that it's dark, we can see by the stars
And it's hollow, but it's beautiful too
In the shadows, with the light coming through

Lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down
