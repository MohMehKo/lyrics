Nothing's promised in this life
So I am thankful that we're here tonight
Take my hand and let's look up
At the stars - we can make them ours

I wanna be your light
Let me be your light, I'll light your way
Across the milky way
I wanna be your star
Let me be your star, I'll light your way
Across the milky way

I don't want to see you cry
All that pain you hold inside
Life is waiting don't forget
You are free - I'll help you see

I wanna be your light
Let me be your light, I'll light your way
Across the milky way
I wanna be your star,
Let me be your star, I'll light your way
Across the milky way

There's no time in life to judge
Only time enough for love
So as another night slips by
Let us dance beneath the sky
