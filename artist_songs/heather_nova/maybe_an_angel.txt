I put my hands where your wings should be,
I put my feet where the earth should be
And I can't see very far
And when you said that you were dead I hung on

Something I feel
You are an angel, or maybe you could've been
Something out here
You are an angel or maybe you could've been.

I've got this light hangs over me
I've got this fear cuts into me
And I can't see very far
And when you said that you were dead I hung on

Something I feel
You are an angel, or maybe you could've been
Something out here
You are an angel or maybe you could've been

See how they run
And nobody said you would go
See how they fall
And I can't see very far
And when you said you were dead I hung on

Something I feel
You are an angel, or maybe you could've been
Something out here
You are an angel or maybe you could've been
See how they run
See how they run
All the same, all the same
Something out here
You are an angel.
