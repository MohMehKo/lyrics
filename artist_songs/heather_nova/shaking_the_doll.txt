Oh I won't be your pretty baby;
I won't eat from your hand again.
And the man in the white says it's alright,
He says, come on girl give up the fight.
You'll go to sleep, there will be no pain.
Well I want to live with myself again.

Well, where we lived there was a lighthouse,
Throwing a white beam into our house,
Over my body when I was sleeping,
Over the secrets I was keeping,
I could tell myself there would be no pain,
But I have to live with myself again.

I'm digging up, I'm digging up,
I'm digging up, I'm digging up,
I'm digging up, I'm digging up,
I'm digging in the earth.

I'm looking for signs
And I'm shaking the dolls
And the fairy-tales lied
And somewhere, back there
I didn't understand;
Man and woman and woman and man.
And I'm shaking the dolls
I'm shaking the dolls.

Ooh, the dream isn't coming through;
I can't feel for you.

Well somewhere, back there
I didn't understand;
Man and woman and woman and man,
And I'm shaking the dolls
I'm shaking the dolls.
Ooh I have to live with myself again,
I want to be with my body again,
You can't make me hollow again.

Ooh, the dream isn't coming through;
I can't feel for you.

Love, shooting up, through my veins -
I gotta get a hit again.
