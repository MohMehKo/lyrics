I lie in a field, in the trailer-park of my dreams
Saving up for someday.
But what does someday mean?
And I'm young but I let it stip on by
I'm co-dependent and I'm lost inside
And you, you look like freedom
You look like the avalanche I need
The avalanche I need

And there's a road, leads away from here
And every day I stand in place and watch it disappear
And there's a bird, circles in my mind
Security's the whore in me that never lets me fly
And you, you look like freedom
You look like change
You look like the avalanche I need
The avalanche I need

With your sunburned soul
And your hunger for the road
I'm snowblind and I'm crying after
Like nothing matters
When you go down take me
When you go down, yeah, make me
I got a hunger you could feed

And I know it's a fine line divides
The place I'm looking for and what's inside
And I know it's a long, long way
Through the outskirts of everyday
And you, you took like freedom,
You look like change
You look like the avalanche I need
The avalanche I need
Avalanche
