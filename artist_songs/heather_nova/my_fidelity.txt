Is it something ritual
I'm caught in, can't break the spell?
Is it moving in my body
Is it biological?
I gotta hand it to you
You've got one heart ten times divided.
Did you cut yourself in pieces
To get them all inside?

You dream about her, can't you see?
She's only shining bright
'cause she's so out of reach.
You dream about the seven seas
While I'm staying home each night,
Making love to my fidelity.

I'm rocking in my bed
I can't talk can't think can't sleep.
And nothing's jumping fences,
I only count what I cannot keep.
I lick my wounds,
I chase my instinct like a cat.
I don't know how I got so good
Or why my heart's a trap.

Why I love you, why I love you
Why I love you I don't know,
Why I love you, why I love you, why.
Taking sides with my enemy
Making love to my fidelity.

I'm landlocked, stuck in here,
I don't want to take my freedom.
I can't change what makes me high
And I can't change what I believe in.
I'm not pleasing no guru,
I'm not out to look for Jesus.
I'm not afraid to break the rules
It's just, one love keeps me breathing.

Why I love you, why I love you
Why I love you, I don't knok
Why I love you, why I love you, why.
Taking sides with my enemy
Making love to my fidelity
