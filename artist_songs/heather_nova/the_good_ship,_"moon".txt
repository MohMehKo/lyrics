Moon, they let you sink down
Through the seas you rode
But no one takes the dream
It holds me fast
Anchored in the deep
It everlasts

Hold your course
Northwest, southeast
Shore to shore
We're all going
Home to where
The heart is

I try to find my way down
But the tears come
Blue, the silver light
I feel the ocean now
The waves we ride
The circle of the moon above inside

Hold your course
Northwest, southeast
Shore to shore
We're all going
Home to where
Home to where
The heart is

And I wish that I could bring those feelings back
All the pieces from my childhood
And I wish that I could somehow hold my breath
All the way down
Moon
Moon

Hold your course
Northwest, southeast
Shore to shore
We're all going
Home to where
Home to where
Home to where
The heart is
