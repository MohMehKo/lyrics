Come to wind, carry it from the sun
Come to rain, turns up the corners of my mouth

And I like this wide open view
But I'm not looking further than you

Come to stranger, wants to know my name
Come tomorrow, I still feel the same

And I like this wide open view
But I'm not looking further than you

Oh, on a day like this 
you can see forever 
that's okay

'cause I like this wide open view
but I'm not looking further than you

Come to Moon, floating like a fish
Come to First Star, who'd have thought it'd come to this

And I like this wide open view
But I'm not looking further than you
Further than you
