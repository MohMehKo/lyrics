Storm's out on the water,
I watch it getting closer,
Are you coming home?
All these years we've wandered
Trying to break the cycle
All these years of hope

And my heart feels the strain,
But it makes me feel like I'm alive again
Well sometimes in our lives
We need the pain

So I find some candles,
Put out all the anchors
Pull the shutters down
It makes me think about us
All those things that got lost
Still we're holding on

And the storm rushes in
But it makes me feel like I'm alive again
Well sometimes, in our lives we need the pain

The wind, the rain, the storm will wash us clean again
The wind, the rain, the storm will make us think again
The wind, the rain, the storm will shake us up again
The wind
And maybe we can start again

Storm's out on the water,
Sea and sky become one
Are you coming home?
