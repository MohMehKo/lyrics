Come on sweetie, I know the game
Since a teen I was raised by a [?] tank
If you can't respect that it's when you know you changed
Haters throwing shots I don't feel shit, novacane
[?] is the pistol you'll be broken till you kidding
Face double backing overdose when it's the hit it
Tell the cane I got a match to came up young [?] the gutter
[?] my mother give a fuck about the fashion said fuck 9 to 5
Hustle to get fly tell it [?] leave nigger just to get by
Out all night nigger just to get a side
Young man's game this old lames is child
Thought he was over division one surprise
Motherfuckers left me but damn I'm alive
Flying kept my shot is my had low disguise
Bring em up to the penthouse deep so high

I think I started something, I got what I wanted
It didn't not came, can't feel nothing
[?] even when I'm fucking, viagra hopping
Every single record, auto tuning, zero emotion
You did emotion, bitch corrected, computing, emotion
Aha, I [?] on the model broad with the hollywood smile
Aw, stripper booty and [?] like wow
Brain like berkley [?] I went to see [?] she went to see
[?] perfect, I took a seat on a ice cold [?] she handed me a ice blue [?], whatever
She said she wanna be a [?] really bad, she's in school [?] born in the fact
At least she working
But girl I can't feel my face
What are we smoking anyway?
She said don't let the high go to waste
But can you taste, a little taste, novacane baby, baby
Novacane baby, I want you
Fuck me good fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none, love me none, numb numb numb numb

Sink full of dishes, paste in the kitchen
Cocaine for breakfast, yaikes
Bed full of women, flip on the tripod
Little red light on shooting
I'm feeling like stanley kubrick
This is a vision every shit
They trying to feel pleasure with my eyes wide shut
Whether keeps all moving
I blame it on the model broad with the hollywood smile
Stripper booty with a wreck like wow
Lover, forget ya, you put me on a feeling I never had, never had, never had
And ever since [?], been trying to get it back, to pick it up and put it back
Now I'm something like the chemist on chem
But there's no drug around, my life what I found you, you, you
I still can't feel my face, what are we smoking anyway?
She said don't let the high go to waste
But can you taste, a little taste, novacane baby, baby
Novacane baby, I want you
Fuck me good fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none, love me none, numb numb numb numb
Novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane
Numb the pain, bumn the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain
Novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane
For the pain, for the pain, for the pain
Novacane, novacane, whoa ah, whoa ah, oh ah, oh, oh
Pretty girls above with me, making pretty love to me pretty
Pity, pity, all the pretty girls in love with me making pretty love to me, pretty, pity, pity
I can't feel the pain, I can't feel the pain, I can't feel the pain
Can't feel the pain, can't feel, feel, feel, feel the
I can't feel feel feel the
Novacane, novacane, I can't feel the
Novacane for the pain for the pain for the pain, I can't feel the, feel the, feel the
Novacane, novacane, cane.
