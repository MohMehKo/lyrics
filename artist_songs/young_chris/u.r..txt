I swear I swear you are
I swear I swear you are
I swear I swear you are
Hey girl

Between the clouds and the moon all I see is my star
... about the space baby see us a Mars
Biggest way the ball when you being the boss
... without seeing the cause
The... but take a vendetta, my paper thin never
Trips to... private beaches
Master sweet, that boy swag elite
Coop's zoning through the traffic, wi fi
... Saturday night live
Chef's amaze while latest I ride
Overseeing the ocean from the shower outside
Guess I get used to my future cause my past done
Can't front, you better than my last one
And I know you seen the... past
You just... in that ass

Baby you are, way better than my last one
Baby you are, fly and not because the fashion
Baby you are, I wouldn't think about passing
You up, cause you are, the star

Told them boys they ain't fly in this man
Over decade of balling
I swear I swear you are
Do it like we do it
I swear I swear you are
Nigs know what it is
I swear I swear you are
Home of the flyest, who's flyer than this
Fly without the... boy
Shit, that you... I can see it cause I be it
I could see it now, wanted to leave when I beat it
I could see the potential I don't know if they see it
I could see why them hating bitches calling you...
You the shit baby, and they ain't gotta believe it
Too much class to argue too cute to let them scar you
Much more than a star yeah you are boo
... I really wanna know who are you?
Favorite position to your favorite colors
I protect my lovers, yeah I stay...
You know how niggers... about they baby mothers
Crazy baby fathers, I know it's baby brothers
I ain't stunting that, stupid nigger ain't nobody telling you to come with that
And... exactly what come with that
... I like her better than my last one
Baby you are, way better than my last one
Baby you are, fly and not because the fashion
Baby you are, I wouldn't think about passing
You up, cause you are, the star

I swear I swear you are,
I swear I swear you are,
I swear I swear you are,

... you ain't a role model,
Tell them hoes... baby
They can't keep up
... she love my ghost
Love me for me that's what I love the most
Gee, I love them all
But I ain't in love
Cause l-o-v-e be the ladies worst...
Baby cure the... to make you mine
... sweetie can't decline
This seem to get addicted
The girlfriend thing turning to mistress
And I ain't getting married no time soon
... I just jump in the room
Working out know they hear me in the other room
Wake up to the pussy fuck her early after noon
... every time she leave
She suck it all out every time she please
Right there prepared every time I need
Might of met my match, my kind of speed

Baby you are, way better than my last one
Baby you are, fly and not because the fashion
Baby you are, I wouldn't think about passing
You up, cause you are, the star

I swear I swear you are
I swear I swear you are
I swear I swear you are a star.
