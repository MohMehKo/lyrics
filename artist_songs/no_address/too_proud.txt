Heard that you were messing around love
I never wanted that at all

When I come around
Baby I know what to do

Always knew that you were leaving
Never wanted me to keep you

I'm driving round this town
But baby I know what to do

There's always someone else
But baby I know what to do

It's just that

You're always too proud
And when your heart starts breakin'
A little bit of love is all you need

I hear the whining cars screech by
I listen for the song of your cry

I'm driving round this town
But baby I know what to do

The night you stammered in your robe
I couldn't talk cuz I was choking

Thinking of it now
Baby I know what to do

Your biting on your lip
And baby I know what to do

Your love is curious
Cold and curious
Is it gone from us?

It is gone from us.
