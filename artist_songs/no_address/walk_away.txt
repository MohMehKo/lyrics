Your brown eyes are so wicked,
The sky is yellow.
The ocean fell asleep
With one hefty bellow.

Could you love me each and every day?

You sulk right past the boardwalk
And I come follow.
I know that I am not
Your one only fella.

You should walk away from me
Right now just go ahead and walk away from me

We coughed our love into the sun
The sea all bent right as we drown

You should walk away from me right now.

I wear no shirt, your short skirt
Has me all jealous-
I hope it rains on you
I stole your umbrella.
