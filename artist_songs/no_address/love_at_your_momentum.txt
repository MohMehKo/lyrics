Katie's just a little girl who
Always, never, talk laugh listen.
She just wants me to wait here by her side.
But since I really don't like waiting
And since I think it doesn't matter:
Katie you can see me when I'm gone

I don't like this
I just won't buy it
And I don't want to try it no more

Maybe on the weekend we can
Go out to the movie theatre
Catch some dinner down there at the scene

But when I go and make some time
Katie says that I'm not truthful
And there's always something I don't say

I don't like this
I just won't buy it
And I don't want to try it no more

Katie can you see me when I'm gone?
Katie you can see me when I've

Gone away in the park
Without you in the dark

Girl when you went to stand
I just couldn't help but to pull your hand.

Now she walks around the town with
Her fat lip bulging

She shows her crooked teeth
And her eyes are all wicked

Love at your momentum
I'm skipping like a stone
I'm tired of screwin' up
And I'm tired of screwin' you girl
