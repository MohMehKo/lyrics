I met a girl from Brownsville
She kamikaze head-turn got me into a frill,
I told her about my friends back home
What they'd say-

How she spoke

Lasting Words in the lasting night
And every time I see a boat by a lake
I want to jump up and say
Let's row away from everything.

Said she was a cutter
And I said my dad's a preacher man.
I took her to the boat out down by the lake

I kindly took her by the hand
Just to make her understand
I took her to the boat out down by the lake

And just when everything was said
I hugged her hard around her head
I told her there are things that we shouldn't say

Now watch me say them

I tore her down today

Everything just goes away
But the scars you hide today
And you don't want to say
Everything just goes away.
