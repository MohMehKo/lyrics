She's just a pretty girl
Who comes around here
To make you smile

Red wine all stains your lips
And baby I'd like to wipe it off
But I can't bare to touch you now

Your eyes are looking down
Right into the pavement

And I hope you know

That I tried to change your mind

Twenty floors up baby says
She just sometimes wants to jump
She holds a drink, she holds a dream
But that's not all

Hand in your pockets
Jingling on your keys and I can't stop it

And I hope you don't
