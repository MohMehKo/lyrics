What would be enough
To turn your head around?
From your heavy tongue
The heaviest of-

So I go, tremble shake

I am just a step away

Here's your song
At your feet
Show them how
They trample me

Hearts are dragging all across the pavement slam the dirt so I
Make you take the worst and you can't help but go and ask for

More

I throw these words away
As autumn hits the ground
I'm sorry mom and dad
I just can't listen

Your smoke just burns my face
I fake a stomach ache
What I hate to say
Is everything I mean.
