Don't you strut like you think you're cool?
Look how you walk with a giant step.

Makes the cute men drool
The rest just stand there with their long hair.

Do you feel like the way I do?
Wanna scream out the way I do?
Do you fight like the way I do?

Or are you Perfect?

Why don't you come out
With what's on your mind?
Show them all how
You bought your time.

Your Perfect, so Perfect

When you step inside the club
Your eyes-they light up-like an ashtray.

When you smoke a diamond stick
The cute men light up with their wallets.

Do you feel like the way I do?
Wanna scream out the way I do?
Do you fight like the way I do?

Or are you Perfect?

Why don't you come out
With what's on your mind?
Show them all how
You bought your time.
Oh you're so perfect
With your golden rings.
The more you go on
The more I think it's time for me to leave.

You turn around and then they come
To let you know
That your world is not enough.
