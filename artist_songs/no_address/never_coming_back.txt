Mom and Dad won't you listen to me
Listen to me cuz what I'm thinkin' is

Cool the quiet little look in your eye
The bigger surprise is I'm doing fine

I zip my jacket up when it rains
I brush my teeth like two times a day
And though it seems so stupid to say
I'm really okay, I'm workin' hard on everything

I can't let you come in
It's just too confusing
Either you tell the truth and leave here

Or I am never coming back

When there's something simple to say
You shrug it away, I watch you shrug it away
Cool the quiet little look in your eye
The bigger surprise is I'm doing fine
I zip my jacket up when it rains
I brush my teeth like two times a day
And when it all falls down on my head
And I'm down on my head-I'm belly laughing again

I don't care what you might think
You just don't mean that much to me
I'm awake-the night is loud-mom is quickly running out
I don't care what you might think
You just don't mean that much to me

Do you remember lunch that day
When mother was gone but mother was her name?
