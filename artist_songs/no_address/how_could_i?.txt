You broke another nail
That's too bad for the soul
What to do besides go read
A magazine and smoke

How could I ask for more?

Everything's the same
I woke up on the floor
Yesterday I got a job
Down at the liquor store

How could I ask for more?

But you want more
So here you go
Another page
For your notebook
Force a smile
Yeah life is good

How could I?

Once I stood too tall
I twice fell to the floor
Three or four times
I just could not answer at the door

How Could I ask for more?

Go buy yourself some clothes
Now you don't feel lost
The hangers in your closet
All feel better for the loss
