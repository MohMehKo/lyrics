One had a lovely face
And two or three had sharp

But shrug in face
All in vain

Because the mountain grounds
Cannot but keep this for us

With your mountain head
I was laid

You and I'll be dead someday
And the darker souls have won

But the world will not care
If you're [?]

Wait 'til death with love in mind
With things I never complete

But it all won't matter
Because you'll be in my heart
