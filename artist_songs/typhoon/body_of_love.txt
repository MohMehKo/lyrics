There's a small worm
And it crawls up through your ears
To try and
Bore a hole down in your brain cavity

And you might feel strange
Your hunger won't go away
No matter how you
Fill your belly
It's beyond your anatomy

You tried to think straight
You tried to reason away
But you couldn't 
It's got your number
It breaks down your sanity

Until your inner scientist
Will get down on his knees and he'll say
"Oh my god"
And he'll say
"Oh my god"
And he'll say
"Oh my god why have you forsaken me?"

It's a small word 
And it comes in through your ear
And it conceives
L-o-v-e has taken hold of me
