You're seething with smoke between your teeth
It wraps your head inside the ghost of a burned-out Christmas wreath
And you're trying to keep still within that frame
You swallow your desires like swords from a sheath of cellophane 

It's a desert mirage that you follow
It will disappear and relocate the moment you approach
And in the distance changes color and form
What was here a single cigarette now it's a life that isn't yours

So would you hold my head?

I'm happy to hear you've found true love's embrace
But when the lights are low enough you can see the others' faces
And you realize you've danced these steps before
A miracle is what you want, a miracle is what you're waiting for

But until then, we'll be patient and say 
We can't always be happy
