Every star is a possible death
We gave 'em names
We called 'em cancers
Called 'em accidents

The one that's like a vulture circlin' my head
It burned out five-hundred-million years before I saw it
It burned out five-hundred-million years before I saw it
It burned out five-hundred-million years before I ever saw it
(Before I ever saw it)
(Before I ever saw it)

Count down the time that you have left
In a jar try to catch, try and capture it
Count down the time that you have left
In the dark try to catch, try and capture it
Count down the time that you have left
In a jar try to catch, try and capture it
Count down the time that you have left
