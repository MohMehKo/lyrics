My folks, they left the TV on
I was falling in love years before I ever met someone
Like a prayer, you don't expect an answer
Though you ask for one

And sure my love would come along
Like some little bird and only I would recognize its home
Like the actors I seen on the television
With the stage lights on

What I found was a gamble
You threw yourself in with me
Made a cross and you lit a candle

But we were only strangers cornered in a dark room
Projecting slides of cozy lives on the wall
In the dark I thought I saw you
Or was it nothing at all

Of everyone I ever knew
I'm giving it all to you
I'm asking everything in return
And I have nothing left to lose
I'll get it back through you
And take your offer

It's time I wake and I'm still alive
Now in my expiration date imagine my surprise
Some backwards take on the book of Job
His life was a wager and mine's a joke
Give him what he wants, he will never know
He's tired of trying to let himself go

Of everyone I ever knew
I've gotten used to you
I've grown attached to you being here
With everyone I ever knew
I've learned to count on you
As my own fingers

Of everyone I ever knew
I've gotten close to you
I've grown attached to you being here
With everyone I ever knew
I've learned to count on you
As my own fingers
