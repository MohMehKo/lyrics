Father oh did you see
I saved you an empty seat
All my life you were in between things
Never saving no time for me

No I don't want your money
I don't want your dollar deeds
Just look me in the eye for once
I'm a son you'll never see

Darling just let me sleep
In a pile with your old laundry
While you wear that smile outside
Never save no smile for me

Cause I'm just a smoldered flame
A pocket to put your blade
I'm on the cold side of your back
Not your lover just in the way

Oh lord I feel that I
A doll that you left outside
In the rain for all its life
In the rain for all my life

So tie me down by the old tree
Put me out of my misery
Cause lord I see your sunshine somewhere else
You don't save none for me
You don't save none for me
