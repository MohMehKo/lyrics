Oh what am I waiting for?
A spell to be cast or for it to be broken
At the very last
Some wild ghost from my past comes to split me wide open, oh

If I bandage my eyes
Will you press in my hand a small simple token?
I was born deaf or else you've never spoken

I thought it was safe for me and my own
I began hearing these voices in the dial tone
And they come to me now, though I dismember my phone

They say you want to hear something that you already know
If it comes from above, well this one comes from below
It says, "You are sleeping together, but you will die alone."

I thought it was safe once the seed had been sown
As a child I aspired to be a superhero
Now I live with the corpses of the lives I let go
Well I know you all know how these things start to show

I've been trying to make myself better
So I can fare the fair foul weather
I write a song like a prison letter
I write a song maybe to make me feel better
It won't break free my fetters

I know what came after, but what happened before?
I began making memories at the age of four
Well I learned to use words
I got jealous and bored
Soon I'll be passing out cold on the kitchen floor
Soon I'll be passing out cold on the kitchen floor

Singing, "When am I gonna feel better?
I said when am I gonna feel better?
I said when am I gonna feel better?
I have been patient for a long time now
I've been a patient for a long time now
I've been the patient for a long time now
I've been the patient for a long time now
And I will never be a younger man now"

Oh what am I waiting for?
A spell to be cast or for it to be broken
At the very last
Some wild ghost from my past comes to split me wide open, oh

If I hold out my hand 
There is nothing at all
Because nothing's a token

I will be good though my body be broken
(I will be good though my body be broken)
I will be good though my body be broken
(I will be good though my body be broken)
I will be good though my body be broken
(I will be good though my body be broken)
I will be good though my body be broken
(I will be good though my body be broken)
I will be good though my body be broken
(I will be good though my body be broken)
I will be good though my body be broken
(I will be good though my body be broken)
I will be good though my body be broken
(I will be good though my body be broken)

I will be good, may I want for nothing at all
