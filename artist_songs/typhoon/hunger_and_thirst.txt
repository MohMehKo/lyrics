I'm hoping for
A song that will come to me while I'm asleep
'Cause I can't lie
So I can't write

Eyes in the dark
And it has occurred to me
That I have spent my whole life
Starting over, oh oh

Cry, pining for
The things that I could have been
I could have been a gold digger 
I could have been a gunslinger
I could have been a little bigger
I could of been an own ringer

I could've been a pop singer
I could've been a pop singer
I could've been a pop singer
But what I am is a silence

I crawled into a spotlight
Cleared my throat and I closed my eyes
I sang a song that I didn’t like
I sang a song that I didn’t like
And I was left in the long night
I hoped to God that I wouldn’t die
Before I gave it an honest try
Now I try
And I try
And I try
To recall a little white light
To put me back into my right mind
I dig a hole and see what I can find
I dig a hole and see what I can find
I’ve been burying my whole life
Beneath the lie that it looks like
Beneath the song that I didn’t write
Beneath the song that I didn’t write

I crawled into a spotlight
And in my state I was a sorry sight
I sing a song til I get it right
I sing a song til I get it right

I sing a song til I get it right
I sing a song til I get it right
I sing a song til I get it right
