Eternity will smile
Eternity will smile
Eternity will smile
On me

I never said I was honest
I never said I was honest
But I am true
And I am true

We all see something different
We all recall something different
When we watch the parade go marching through

So be kind to all of your neighbors
Be kind to all of your neighbors
'Cuz they're just like you
They're just like you

And you're nothing special
Unless they are too

On my time I've walked a fine old line
I held a vacant sign upon my eyelids
On my time, oh Lord, I've been so blind
But now I see the light through my doorjamb

But there's no Hallelujah, it will be gone soon, yeah
It will be gone soon, yeah
It will be gone soon, yeah
It's just an empty room
This is our darkest cave
We'll never see the day
But slowly make our way up to the mouth

You're gonna piss and moan
You let the devil in your home
You let the devil in your home
You let the devil in your home

Piss and moan
You let the devil in your home
You let the devil in your home
You let the devil in your home
In your home
