I heard my name
Called out from a passing train
Like a summons for
All the foolish blood in my veins
And a choice was made
But would you wait
Would you wait
Would you wait
I ran down to the railway
But I was late

Why couldn't you wait
Why couldn't you wait
You only move when I give chase
And when I catch you
You dissipate
