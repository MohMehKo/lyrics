Death and life
Shines like a light
Stubborn and bright
Oh take me through the night

Heaven and woes
Every man's sorrow
Shoulder that load
Oh the end is in sight

Take my hands
Oh my brothers
Oh take my hands
Oh my brothers

Some day
Oh, some day
The lights will go out

Heaven and life
Oh it shines like a light
Stubborn and bright
Oh take me through the light

Heaven and woes
Every man's sorrow
Shoulder that load
Oh the end is in sight

Oh take my hands
Oh my brothers
Oh take my hands
Oh my brothers

Some day
Oh, some day
The lights will go out
