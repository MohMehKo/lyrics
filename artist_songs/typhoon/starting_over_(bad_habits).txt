I've started
A new beginning
Suspiciously like the old one
Only this time I'm ready

My vessel
A final voyage
Just to pick up a few things
When I'm hoisting my courage

I left the car a-running
In the case that I hear
The cavalry coming

I need a reason to leave
And let you have it
Let you have it
I need a reason to kick you
Like a bad habit
Just like a bad habit
Like a bad habit...
