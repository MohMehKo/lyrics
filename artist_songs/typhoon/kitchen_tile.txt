You don't want to waste what's left of your life
Trying to stay alive
For just a little while

You know you should come back home from there
And get some peace and quiet
Just for a little while

When you were gone your house became my home
It felt like my own
If for a little while

And I'm sorry if it's changed from when you left
If we made a mess
If we carved our debts
