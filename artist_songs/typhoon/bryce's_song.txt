When I close my eyes inside the skies
The clouds around my brain collide
You're losing me to misery
You're lonely without company

My eyes refuse to believe the way you are
Don't want to see you fall apart
How long will you be here with me?
Can I escape eternal grief?

I'll keep you in my memory
As you the one who virtually
Am I the one who yells and screams
Attack my brain and face my dreams

My lungs refuse to breath
Can't find the words to try to speak just what I mean
How long will you be here with me?
Can I escape eternal grief?

And I know Sunday you'll be gone
And I'll be here all alone
You can't think of me anymore
My thoughts of you forever more

My mind refuses to think
Of the world when you gone
Don't want to see the dust in your bones
How long will you be here with me?
Can I escape eternal grief?
