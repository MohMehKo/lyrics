You've got your hope caught up in your chest
So when you speak it makes you swollen in the face
You shouldn't be such a good target
I'll make you choke, I'll make you hide it between your legs
For if I have none, you'll have the same

We are conceived all with the same chance
To be spared, to be salvaged, to be kept safe
Then you hope to god nothing bad will happen
From when you're born 'til you go quietly from old age
To make your hope feel like a crushing weight

I found a friend in the great great beast
He's digging his claws in me
He's digging his claws in me

All degree shall be leveled
Because you know, you have the right, you have the right
To pursue the happiness of your neighbors
And when you catch it, you'll put it out like a light
And the few who are left, we'll set them right

Found a friend in the great great beast
He's digging his claws in me
He's digging his claws in me
As he's digging his claws in me
Whispers names of my enemies
He names my enemies
And as he names my enemies
I don't suspect anything
Is this what freedom is supposed to mean?
I can choose what I don't believe in
The truth is dying
Your youth's a dying breed

Oh misery loves company
So careful of the friends you keep

Misery loves company
So careful of the friends you keep
Misery loves company
So careful of the friends you keep
