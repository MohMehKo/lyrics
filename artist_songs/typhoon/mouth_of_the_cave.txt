All my time
I've walked a filed line
I've held a vacant sign
Up on my eyelids

Oh all my time
Oh lord I've been so blind
But now I see the light
Peek through my door-jamb 

But there's no hallelujah
It will be gone soon
Yeah it will be gone soon
It's just an empty room
This is our darkest cave
We'll never see the day
But slowly make our way
Up to the mouth

You gonna piss and moan
You let the devil in your home
