Hush my darling let your head down
Sleep will finally come tonight
Where we lay beneath the world's end
Take my hand and take my life

And ghost we'll walk among the ruins
Of cities where we used to live
Broken glass and burning buildings
Will pave to shallow sewers

You can close your eyes
You can close your eyes
I won't close mine
