Open up the night.
Led by just a feeling.
All around is light.
Everything is healing.

No more fate ans no more mystery.
Even as time falls away I live my days
every moment and its memory,
not only to survive to die alive.

Overwhelming love,
heaven's just a feeling.
Singing in my blood
keeping me from kneeling.

No more fate ans no more mystery.
Even as time falls away I live my days
every moment and its memory,
not only to survive to die alive.

Die Alive.

No more fate ans no more mystery.
Even as time falls away
I live my days every moment and its memory,
not only to survive to die alive.
