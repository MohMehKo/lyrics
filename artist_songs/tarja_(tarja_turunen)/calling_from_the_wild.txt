See the world as one
Find what grows from stone
Roam our circle, come home.

On my ocean, are you shadowing me?
Breaking surface to connect again
For a moment, I can feel what you feel
So clear, and I’m with you again.

In my air, I feel you covering me
Out of trust, you gave me the power to them
And if only they could see what you see
Wind and love never hide
Into the sky.

One more
Stand for
Freedom

Calling from the wild side
For life
Reason

There’s no life, without a dream
No power strong enough to hold it back
In a never ending stream
See the world as one
Listen to the call and stand for…
One more,
One more,
One more.

From my trees I know you’re following me
Through the wind I hear you speaking of love
And a message that I want to believe
That we forgot and now I’m with you again
Wind and love never hide
Into the sky.

One more,
One more,
There’s no life, without a dream
No power strong enough to hold it back
In a never ending stream
See the world as one
Listen to the call and stand for…
One more,
One more,
One more.
