Wanna stay in bed, got a heavy head, 
a sledge-hammer in my skull
But I'm scared I'd wind up dead, 
if life should get too dull
Well, maybe there ain't no divine plan 
and things just happen 'cause they can
Just don't paint devils on the wall 
ain't nothing cool about death at all

Love and light are haven-sent
We really ain't all that helbent
On darkness as our style
We'd rather make you smile
Killing then with kindness all the while

Why on earth d'you wanna blame god
When things don't go your way?
It's just the evil that mean do down here everyday
Take responsibility for you actions and you liberty
Can't neglect cause and effects with your apathy
The second coming came and went
Third time lucky, heaven sent
It ain't no shuck "n" live
You control your life
You don't need the trouble or the strife

If there's a god we know him well
If there's a devil we can tell
There ain't no punishment in hell
Sin is only man's invention
It ain't no divine interventions
You make you own heaven and you hell
If there's a god we know him well
If there's a devil we can tell
There ain't no punishment in hell
You don't get saved by the bell
If there's a god we know him well
If there's a devil we can tell
There ain't no punishment in hell
Sin is only man's inventions
It ain't no divine intervention
You make your own heaven and your hell
And your hell
Your hell
