Black Eyes and hardly breathing
When there's no light
You sacrifice
Alone amongst the living
You lost the fight before the fall

How did you end up in hell?

Hysterical, tragical
Victim of Ritual
Cynical, critical
Victim of ritual
She's a killer, killer
She's a killer, killer

Cold eyes for every sin
They tried to hide in thin disguise
Denied your soul from singing
Her darkest night, the night you died

How did you end up in hell?

Hysterical, tragical
Victim of Ritual
Cynical, critical
Victim of ritual
She's a killer, killer
She's a killer, killer

Pandemonium, where's your heart from?
Pandemonium, where's your heart from?
