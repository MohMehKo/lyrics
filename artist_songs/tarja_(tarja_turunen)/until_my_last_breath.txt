Cannot cry it loud enough
I'm giving up this ghost
How can I still justify
When you deny my voice?
In this nothing I am not allowed
I just follow alone
Words as weapons without a sound
Echoes dying unborn

[Chorus:]
Until my last breath
You'll never know
Until you feel the silence
When I am gone
Now it's vanishing
Everything
What we might have been
Only now you praise
Call my name that you won't see again

Who can change this memory?
Inside it needs to burn
Worship by the enemy
The guilty take their turns
Watching as it's disappearing
Shadows all that remain
Wishes slowly crossing over
In this parade of pain

[Chorus x2]

Until my last breath you'll never know
Until you feel the silence when I am gone
Now it's vanishing, everything what we might have been
Only now you praise, call my name that you won't see again
