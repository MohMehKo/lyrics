Legend says that when grief overpowers happiness
the northern star loses its light and falls down on earth
where thee become a man.
One person alone can help.

I'm the one who leaves shadows in you room at night:
I'm the reason you're listening enlightening you eyes.
When Pan meets Apollo down with the sin
they will send tears of angels though kindness won't win.

Lost northern star
Buried in sorrow,
I'll guard your mind.
Let demons howl outside.

Where the calm fields of snow become one with the sky
I am there; I am waiting as time passes by
I set up the weather to suit how you feel
Drop rain down with wishes, build grace out of steel

Lost northern star
Buried in sorrow,
I'll guard your mind.
Let demons howl outside.

My soul burns.

Sending dream flakes your way.
painting pictures to help you each day.
Yet you don't know I'm there.

Lost northern star
Buried in sorrow,
I'll guard your mind.
Let demons howl outside.

My soul burns.
