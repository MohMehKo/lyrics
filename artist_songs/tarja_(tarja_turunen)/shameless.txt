Shameless lies…

I used to think that is just my imagination,
I hear you through the tale, day and night.
Oh just you there, shifted into the desperation.
Are we accepting this without a fight?

You well know how much your words deceive.
You well know how much you need, I still believe.

Take me there,
where our wisest are heard.
Take me anywhere,
then I, I, I…
Won't feel this fear.
All I see,
is I see through my eyes,
the truth,
the shameless lies.

You get away,
with steel in through you dedication.
Thought of face it,
words of sleeping crowns.
I am to kidding?
There it is it with temptation?
They are the monstering,
your builds of crowd.

You well know how much your words deceive.
You well know how much you need, I still believe.

Take me there,
where our wisest are heard.
Take me anywhere,
then I, I, I…
Won't feel this fear.
All I see,
is I see through my eyes,
the truth,
the shameless lies.

Take me there,
where our wisest are heard.
Take me anywhere,
then I, I, I…
Won't feel this fear.
All I see,
is I see through my eyes,
the lies…

Take me there,
where our wisest are heard.
Take me anywhere,
then I, I, I…

All I see,

the truth,
the shameless lies.

Take me there,
where our wisest are heard.
Take me anywhere,
then I, I, I…
Won't feel this fear.
All I see,

the lies…

Shameless lies…
