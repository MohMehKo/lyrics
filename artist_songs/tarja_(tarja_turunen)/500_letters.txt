500 letters from a stranger at my door
500 letters, words like scars no one can see

It felt so innocent, a childish game
lines of poetry without a name
waves of paranoia washed upon the page
and soon obsession turned to rage

why do you love me?
why do you want to hurt me?

500 letters from a stranger at my door
500 weapons I can't take it anymore
500 letters, words like scars no one can see
500 secrets, slowly killing me

At the mercy of a violent hand
drawing images in my head
I can't escape the way I feel inside
in every shadow just a breath behind

why do you love me?
why do you want to hurt me?

They found the final letter lying by his side
A smile was on his face, cold as ice
One last message written only for me
Now you won't forget
"I'll see you in your dreams"
