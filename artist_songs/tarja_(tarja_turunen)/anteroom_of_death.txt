Two faced drama rebellion
Are you the Joker, King or Queen?
Place your cards as they're coming
Came to win, lost everything
Gambling riders pull the strings
Pull them tighter, let them in

Come and play another day
Throw your mask away
I don't care what you say
'Cause your lovely words decay
Come and play another day
Welcome to the anteroom of death

Hide your conspiracies so
Who's got the keys and who has not?
Sell your fortune to me
'Cause I can still read behind all that
Burn your fingers, trade a dream
Watch the clock as it's ticking

Come and play another day
Throw your mask away
I don't care what you say
'Cause your lovely words decay
Come and play another day
Welcome to the anteroom of death

Blinded in the dark
I'm touching the scars of tainted hearts
If you're searching, learn to see
Honesty is all you need
Take a bow, finally

Come and play another day
Throw your mask away
I don't care what you say
'Cause your lovely words decay
Come and play another day
Welcome to the anteroom of death
