Life in bloom
The sweetest season
Warm embrace gave me the meaning

Another time
A cross to carry
Cruel facÌ§ade imaginary

I don't belong

There's no going back
What we used to be
There's no room for us
No place for me

Never enough, never enough,
No, never enough, never enough,
I gave it all,
You still want more

A childish game
A search for reason
Coldest day when I stopped believing
Another war
My endless laughter
Storyline is all they're after

I don't belong

There's no going back
What we used to be
There's no room for us
No place for me

Never enough, never enough,
No, never enough, never enough,
I gave it all,
You still want more

There's no going back
What we used to be
There's no room for us
No place for me

Never enough, never enough,
No, never enough, never enough,
I gave it all,

(never enough)

(never enough)
(never enough)
(never, never, never enough)
