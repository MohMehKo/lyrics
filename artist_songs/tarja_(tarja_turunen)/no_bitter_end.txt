There's a road for everyone
Cause every heart's the same
To forgive what you have done
A silent wish for change.

Desire is a flame alive
When dreams are far away
Open up your inner eye
Let hope save the day.

She will fall all over you
Like a rain, shine the new
And will make the path for you to take
Till the end, walk you through.

Time won't wait
Lead your fate
Never let go.

Blackout the sun
Light nowhere
Tell me you don't need it anymore
No bitter end.

Hold on, don't run
Forever still yourself
The one that you defend
No bitter end.

Silently, misteriously
How brave worlds are born
They cut away the misery
For hearts to find home.

To be there with all you need
And nothing left to prove
Take a chance, oh, but never leave
Know it all starts with you.

Time won't wait
Lead your fate
Never let go.

Blackout the sun
Light nowhere
Tell me you don't need it anymore
No bitter end

Hold on, don't run
Forever still yourself
The one that you defend
No bitter end.

There's a road for everyone
Cos every heart's the same
To forgive what you have done
A silent wish for change.

Blackout the sun
Hold on, don't run...

Blackout the sun
Light nowhere
Tell me you don't need it anymore
No bitter end.

Hold on, don't run
Forever still yourself
The one that you defend
No bitter end.
