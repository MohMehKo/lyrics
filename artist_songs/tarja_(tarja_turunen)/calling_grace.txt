In the dark
Captured in his frozen heart
Colours fade in to grey
She tried so hard
Every word was torn apart
Shot her down with poison darts

Her tears made a swim beneath the sea
She's free

Calling grace
She'll never fall again
Love remains in her

Softly
Her inner voice has learned to speak
Following her dreams

Her tears made a swim beneath the see
She's free

Calling grace
She'll never fall again
Love remains in her

Calling grace
She will rise again
Sacrifice the saints
Still love remains
