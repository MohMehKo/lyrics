Dark blue sea, calling me.
Songs of waves, keep me safe.
Sky's so deep, there's no end
the moon still asleep, the bed of stars for me

How can I see through your eyes my destiny?
I fall apart.
You bleed for me.
How can I see through your eyes our worlds collide?
Open your heart, to close our great divide.

Distant prayers, carved in stone.
The silent words they will still be heard.

How can I see through your eyes my destiny?
I fall apart.
You bleed for me.
How can I see through your eyes our worlds collide?
Open your heart, to close our great divide.

How can I see through your eyes my destiny?
I fall apart.
You bleed for me.
So I just float with the tide through the night I pass you by.
Open my heart, to close our great divide.
