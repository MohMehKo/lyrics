Bring out to dead
Iâ€™ll bury them all
Leave them with me.

Dress them in silk
Black as the night
Where no one can see.

Paint them with dirt
Shallow their graves
Silent their names.

Swallowed by earth
Written in dust
Killing the fame.

How did they die?
Oh the despair
So many lost.

Original sin
Gone in thin air
That is the cost.

No one recalls
All that is left
Nameless farewell.

Minding the fall
Cover the theft
Welcome to hell.

Meet your maker, ring your bells in vain
Undertaker, I am why you came
Feed your life with every need you have
And down below, forever, oh how sad.

Covered with thorns
Knocking the wood
Scratching the lid.

Legends are born
Without fine jewels
Here I forbid.

Walk amongst you
Sing to your sweet
Dark lullabies.

Giving you rest
Tainting your dreams
Cover your eyes.

Meet your maker, ring your bells in vain
Undertaker, I am why you came
Feed your life with every need you have
And down below forever, oh so sad.
