Blue skies, rivers of gold
Bring to my heart
The stories of old
I remember the way to begin

Lead by all my grace
And a brave hand of peace
The air will lift us, our hearts a gift as
We feel the release

The breaking of dawn
I see the wind and the breeze
Will carry us home,
Joining us all in unified love

The sweetness of peace
More precious than gold,
The tender compassion
That gives elation as we behold

Break of dawn is coming,
With wisdom, wind and breeze,
Touching on the seas.

So here in our hearts
lay way to our home
Where all find comfort,
Blue skies, rivers of gold

The sweetness of peace
More precious than gold,
The tender compassion
That gives elation as we behold

Break of dawn is coming,
With wisdom, wind and breeze,
Touching on the seas.

So here in our hearts
lay way to our home
Where all find comfort,
Blue skies, rivers of pure gold
