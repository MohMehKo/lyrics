I've been to the end of earth, the waters, end of sky
I've circled the mountains, the forests, across the nights
Over the land that I have seen
Where the wind swept my heart clean

I found a way to feel alive
Leaving behind your eagle eye

Love like a dancing fire, untamed, blazing high
The power to dwell as one, unchained, will not die
When you have burned so deep within
Rest the ashes, then begin

I found a way to feel alive
Leaving behind your eagle eye

Over the land that we have seen
Where the wind swept our hearts clean
When we have burned so deep within
Rest the ashes, then begin

Eagle eye

I found a way to feel alive
Leaving behind your eagle eye

I found a way to feel alive
Leaving behind your eagle eye
