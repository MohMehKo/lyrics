The streets are empty
inside it's warm.
his hands are shaking
they locked the door
a voice is calling
asking to get in

all he wanted was a toy
all he needed was a gentle heart
to lead him through the dark
when his dreams are running wild
boy and the ghost
fire's not burning
the lights went out
the lights went out

big family dinner
the untold tale
there eyes are sparkling on his frozen face
angel's calling
asking to get in

all he wanted was a toy
all he needed was a gentle heart
to lead him through the dark
when there's nowhere left to fall
boy and the ghost
his eyes are burning
the lights went out
the dreamy is on.

wake up, wake up:
there's an angel in the snow
look up, look up:
it's a frightened dead boy
with so much hate, such bad dreams.
he could have seen
the toy's the key
but no one saw
no one saw

all he wanted was a toy
all he needed was a bleeding heart
to lead him through the dark
boy and the ghost

Despero, solitas, debilis, desolo.
Despero, solitas, debilis, desolo.

when there's nowhere left to fall.
nowhere to hide
the silence is hurting
inside it's cold
sleep or die
nowhere to go
nowhere to hide
his light went out
