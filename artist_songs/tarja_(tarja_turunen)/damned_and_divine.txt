I won't help if you wait for me.
I'm a slave to the dark.
I Know I'm not saint, you see.
The Dawn is when it starts.

Feel the shadow of my oblivion
hoping mercy would show her face
on the road to your own perdition
in the coal-blackened rain.

Frozen in time yearning forbidden wishes.
Damned and divine.
Scars of my broken kisses.
What will follow if tomorrow's blind?
My eternal night.

As the wind takes me away from you
before the morning light.
My sins are fading into view
I'm so weary deep inside

Feel the shadow of my oblivion
hoping mercy would show her face
on the road to your own perdition
I may see you again.

Frozen in time yearning forbidden wishes.
Damned and divine.
Scars of my broken kisses.
What will follow if tomorrow's blind?
My eternal night.

Every single dawn I die again.
