We can laugh at it now
I don’t mind all the burning daggers
Piercing me, shaping me
Turning the blade on you.

I revealed my escape
Sweetest mutiny, ship was sinking
Deeper and deeper and deeper
On top of you.

Oh, how does it feel?
Now when there’s no way out
You married your own hell
Couldn’t get out of your own mind.

Now I have the key
Out of the downwards spiraling conspiracy
Just look at me
Just look at...

Diva, Diva, Diva, Diva!

When you chiselled your scene 
So delusional, almost got me
Started to question my sanity
cause of you.

I’ve been tasting the salt
Couldn’t stand all the rats on board
I walked down the plank as the curtains dell down on you.

Oh, how does it feel?
Now when there’s no way out
You married your own hell
Couldn’t get out of your own mind.

Now I have the key
Out of the downwards spiraling conspiracy
Just look at me
Just look at...

Diva, Diva, Diva, Diva!

Just look at
Diva, Diva, Diva, Diva!

Oh, how does it feel?
Now when there’s no way out
You married your own hell
Couldn’t get out of your own mind.

Now I have the key
Out of the downwards spiraling conspiracy
Just look at me
Just look at...

Diva, Diva, Diva, Diva!

Just look at
Diva, Diva, Diva, Diva!
