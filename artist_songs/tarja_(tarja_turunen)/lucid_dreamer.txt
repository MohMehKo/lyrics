Memoria, Gloria one last time with you
The feeling remains the same
But I just walk through
The story of forgotten fields I ran with you
To them it's the same
A game, the shame, I leave you

Gloria, memoria

You can do anything
when you feel it
burning at your wings
just look in the mirror
I'm a lucid dreamer

You can go everywhere
you can rise up, see me standing there
just look in the mirror
I'm a lucid dreamer

You're out of air
Memoria no one hurts like you
Nothing to loose
And all I hear is silence
I’m not afraid I’m living with colour every day
The moment is now, you’re far away to find me

You can do anything
when you feel it
burning at your wings
just look in the mirror
I'm a lucid dreamer

You can go everywhere
you can rise up, see me standing there
just look in the mirror
I'm a lucid dreamer
