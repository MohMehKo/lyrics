Take my longings and believe them.
Light a candle if you know.
I breath love, don't wanna be there.
These are things I got to know:
The magic seem so far don't know who they are.

Let me go Minor Heaven, cause my blood to run.
Leave this place, unforgiven.
Heal me with you sun.
How can I come undone?
Let me know Minor Heaven.

Light a way for me to walk on
from the ashes to the sky.
Burn the thorns so I can hold on.
Trust in me I know I'm right.
I'm know I'm gone too far.
Leave them where they are.

Let me go Minor Heaven, cause my blood to run.
Leave this place, unforgiven.
Heal me with you sun.
How can I come undone?
Let me know Minor Heaven.

Even if nothing I'll become
something I've been for all too long.
Let me go Minor Heaven.

Let me go Minor Heaven, cause my blood to run.
Leave this place, unforgiven.
Heal me with you sun.
How can I come undone?
Let me know Minor Heaven.
