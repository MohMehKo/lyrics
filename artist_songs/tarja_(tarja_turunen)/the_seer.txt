I cut my heart - a gift to you
You leave salt in my wound
You are inside my wall of thoughts
But in yours I'm unknown

My desperation finds a book of heroes gone
Legends tell about a saviour wise and strong
I'm burning at the stake of love, the flames get tall
And in my anguish he's the last resort to call

And suddenly my seer is on my side
Bringing love while forgetting his pride
In his eyes I see there'll be better times along my way

Nothing to fear
Nothing to fear

Why is it called Elysian Fields
When love builds only grief
All your agony and pain
Stays the same till you see

That destination shows you legends long extinct
Rumours are told about a hero kind and skilled
I'm burning at love's stake and that's the end I feel

But suddenly my seer is on my side
Bringing love while forgetting his pride
In his eyes I see there'll be better times along my way

As he longs to speak to me
I realise the reflection while listening
His words mend all my wounds cause he is me
My seer lives inside of me

When suddenly my seer is on my side
Bringing love while forgetting his pride
In his eyes I see there'll be better times along my way

Nothing to fear
My seer is near
There's nothing to fear
My seer is near
My seer is near
