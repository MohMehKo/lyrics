Drifting... words without meaning
Twisting... through the dark concealing
Search again, your reflection lives within.

Shades of the labyrinth
The path lies ahead

If you believe
Truth her name is honesty
Let her shine through your darkest temptation
Hidden deep
In sincerity
With your painted smile
So revealing
Tarnished yet there’s no fear in me
Feeding the flower that dies
Is a ray of light
Is a ray of light

Roaming... colours they were sleeping
Senses... they are never-ending
Find again the beauty in the suffering

Shades of labyrinth
The path lies ahead

If you believe
Truth her name is honesty
Let her shine through your darkest temptation
Hidden deep
In sincerity
With your painted smile
So revealing
Tarnished yet there’s no fear in me
Feeding the flower that dies
Is a ray of light
Is a ray of light
