Take all your black arrows
They can not harm no more
Take all your black arrows
They can not harm no more
Fantasies locked up
In your dungeon
Take all your black arrows
They can not harm no more

The universe is watching her
An evil curse lies on her heart
A chariot, pulled by crows
Trying to tear her hope apart.
Confined in sin

[Chorus:]
I can hear the moon is crying
As it spells out your name
(spells out your name)
All the stars are up there sighing
Saying you come back again

Behind the darkest lullaby
They kept their wishes hidden well
The moon had tied a secret bond
Where they could be one again
Confined in sin

[Chorus]

Love, stronger than hatred,
Stronger than anyone
Her heart is gone
Take all your black arrows
They can not harm no more

Take all your black arrows
They can not harm no more
