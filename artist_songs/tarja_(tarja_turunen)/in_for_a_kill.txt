Where do you go from here? It's dragging you under
Nothing could be more clear, when you are the hunter
Is that a dream to die for? A prize, you keep it out of the light

Nothing can shine, left in the dark, far from their eyes
Under black water there is no halo, only the hunger
And you're in for a kill

You and your twisted minds it's making us shiver
How can we be so blind, the fear you deliver
It's all a grand illusion, a trick you keep it out of the light

Nothing can shine, left in the dark, far from their eyes
Under black water there is no halo, only the hunger
And you're in for a kill
