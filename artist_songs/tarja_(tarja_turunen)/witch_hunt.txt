You seek to blame, condemn the name
Bewitch the masses with your own veil
Without remorse you seek the ones
trespassing lines you don't understand

I am the door to the unknown
I hear the whispering souls around
My eyes can see your fear of me
I am not wondering why you're here

No more pain
Wronged again and again
Pride will fall like sounds of misery
In the lips that have been hurt
Still today as before
Write your sins to her core

My gruesome fate
Axe, rope, or flame
Put me to death
I'll be born again

No more pain
Wronged again and again
Pride will fall like sounds of misery
In the lips that have been hurt
Still today as before
Write your sins to her core
