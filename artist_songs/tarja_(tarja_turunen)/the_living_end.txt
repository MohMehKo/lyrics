Is the song that's forever
There's no need to surrender

Here with you now
Lights in the air
Devoted
No yesterday
Dying to live this moment

Growing stronger, taking over

Truth in your eyes,
See through my heart
It's open
Make me believe
Gives life to the path I've chosen

Blind desire, reaching higher

Is the song that's forever in the flame within
The living end
There's no need to surrender, I will sing it
The living end

Sounds like colours raining down
Burning up the night
