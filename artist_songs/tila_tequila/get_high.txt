Yeah
Like that
C'mon
Do you want it?
I wanna do it
Shhh

Drivin' in my car speedin' down the 405
Catch me if you can cause I'm hot trying to stay alive
(Take a ride)
Lookin' pretty fly in my droptop silver benz

I just want
To get high
(Like that)
Give me some pills
I just wanna party
Tonight
Runnin' away from him
You know I'll be all right
(Take a ride)

Livin' my life in the fast line as we speak

I just want
To get high
I'm free for the very first time in life
I'm free for the very first time tonight

Be alive
Come spend the night
And send those shivers down my spine
(Can you feel it?)
Toss and turn with the beat
This room is hot
Fillin' up with heat

Close your eyes
I'll take you to fantasyland

I just want
To get high
I'm free for the very first time in life
I'm free for the very first time tonight
I'm free for the very first time in life
I'm free for the very first time tonight
