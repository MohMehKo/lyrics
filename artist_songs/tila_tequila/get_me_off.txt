I spread my legs wide open for ya baby
So be a man and pump it harder inside me
I'm naked here, layin', waitin' for ya baby
Alone, alone, alone
I'm comin' closer, getting wetter for ya baby
You got me feelin', you got me dreamin', wiling out
No need to worry, wanna feel your explosion inside me

Get me off
(Just get off)

Now let me ride ya like a rodeo baby,
I'll twirl around a couple times until I'm there
I'll do it to ya all night till I make you cum, cum, cum
You need to run your fingers through my messy hair
You need to pull it back tight, baby touch me there
If you want to hear me screamin' out loud

Get me off
(Just get me off)

Let me love you right now
Fall before my feet
Let me love you right now
Every single beat
Let me love you right now
Can't you feel the heat
Let me love you right now

Get me off
(Just get me off)
Nasty girl
Get me off
(Just get me off)
