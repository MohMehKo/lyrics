[VERSE 1:]
I found out your behind your lies
Your just a fake friend in disguise
How dare you use me to get rich
I use to think of world of you...

I wasted all my time with you
Thinking that our friendship was true
Accusing me of doing wrong (doing wrong, doing wrong)
When your the one who mess it all up...

[Chorus:]
I had just lots of respects for you (wo uh oh, wo uh oh)
Sadly your still holding on
Now it's time to say goodbye
Why won't you just apologizes (wo uh oh, wo uh oh)
I hope it burns deep inside
And that's not okay

[Verse 2:]
I use to fight to back you up
I risk my life that's still not enough
You have no sense of loyality
I guess you threw it all away now

[Chorus:]
I had just lots of respects for you (wo uh oh, wo uh oh)
Sadly your still holding on
Now it's time to say goodbye
Why won't you just apologizes (wo uh oh, wo uh oh)
I hope it burns deep inside
And that's not okay

[Verse 3:]
When I was down you, just walk away
Didn't even ask me if I was okay...
Falling stars with all the broken dreams
All outside... I can't take it anymore

[Chorus:]
I had just lots of respects for you (wo uh oh, wo uh oh)
Sadly your still holding on
Now it's time to say goodbye
Why won't you just apologizes (wo uh oh, wo uh oh)
I hope it burns deep inside
And that's not okay
