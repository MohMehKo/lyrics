Infatuation is got me spinning out of control
My body achin and I'm not sure why but I'm sure it's got something to do
Do with you
Come once, Come twice, I'm explodin inside
Let's do it all night, Wanna go on a ride

Tell me what's going through your mind
Sex want sex
Please sex me up just one more time
Sex want sex
Turn me around and go on down
Sex want sex
You know I'll like it don't mess around
Want sex want sex want sex want sex you naughty boy

Shed more rain droplets of your sweat dripping onto me
I'll lick you up and down and all around until your body is in ecstasy
Come once, Come twice, I'm explodin inside
Let's do it all night, Wanna go on a ride

Tell me what's going through your mind
Sex want sex
Please sex me up just one more time
Sex want sex
Turn me around and go on down
Sex want sex
You know I'll like it don't mess around
