Would you be mad if you saw me kiss another guy?
You know I want you but you're just a little bit too shy.
When we make love, I've been thinkin about someone else.
I don't mean to be this way but we're just not the same.

[Chorus:]
I know you got the feelin about everything I say is just a lie,
You know I got you whipped and I,
Don't really give a damn what people say.
They all pretend to be your friend but in the end they hit on me,
Kiss me, Just one last time
Because I will just be a memory.

Do you really want to know what I did last night?
I met a boy at the club and he felt me up right.
Ran his fingers through my hair and touched me everywhere.
Now that I have told you, do you still want me here?

[Chorus:]
I know you got the feelin about everything I say is just a lie,
You know I got you whipped and I,
Don't really give a damn what people say.
They all pretend to be your friend but in the end they hit on me,
Kiss me, Just one last time
Because I will just be a memory.
Memory, Kiss me, Kiss me,
Kiss me, Because I will just be a memory.

[Chorus:]
I know you got the feelin about everything I say is just a lie,
You know I got you whipped and I,
Don't really give a damn what people say.
They all pretend to be your friend but in the end they hit on me,
Kiss me, Just one last time
Because I will just be a memory.
