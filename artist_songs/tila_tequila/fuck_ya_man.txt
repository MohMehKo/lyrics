Omg My God
Bo? 
Why do these girls think like 
I wanna fuck their boyfriends? 
That is like so not true
Their boyfriends like, wanna fuck me 
Like oh my god, 
I know I'm hot and all but like, 
That is so wrong, ya know 
So like, I'm not... I'm not

I aint tryin fuck ya man
Everybody know he ma number 1 fan
I done been that done that bitch and 
U wanna get mad bitch I don't give a damn

This is how it do
You is how it don't
Talkin all this shit, but ya know ya really wont
Feelin insecure when I come around the spot
Tila get it crunk so I drop it like it's hot
I see you in the corner grillin me from over there (there)
Cause ya know ya boos like to hit me stright rare
Nuttin up inside while he pullin on ma hair
Hate it or love the underdogs right there! 

[Chorus 2x]
I aint tryin fuck ya man
Everybody know he ma number 1 fan
I done been there done that bitch and 
U wanna get mad bitch I don't give a damn

I aint tryin fuck ya man
Lookin at ma myspace lotion in his hand
When he look at you he be thinkin 'bout me
Take ya Benz back bitch now I got the key
Flossin round the city everybody know ma name
Yea I got your man whipped, bitch wit no game
Sucka ass fool I don't wanna whear ya chain
I got ma own diamonds spelled out in ma name
See he the type of dude that me and ma girls laugh at
Tryin holla at me nahh he can't have that
Need to quit talkin like a bitch, 'fore I slap that
Even if I popped some pills I wouldn't tap that

[Chorus 2x]
I aint tryin fuck ya man
Everybody know he ma number 1 fan
I done been there done that bitch and 
U wanna get mad bitch I don't give a damn

Bitch, I got a suggestion
Get ya ass out ma face
Don't ask no questions
I'm from H-Town fool
You Know what it do
We be sippin on some syrup and spray up ya crew
I don't know why ya think I wanna rape ya boo
But then again if I was you I would hate me to
I'm a bad ass bitch And ya can't get nuttin'
Yall need to tell ya boy somethin, BITCH! 

[Chorus 2x]
I aint tryin fuck ya man
Everybody know he ma number 1 fan
I done been there done that bitch and 
U wanna get mad bitch I don't give a damn
