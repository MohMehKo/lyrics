[VERSE 1:]
Feels like you've been trying to play all these games
With you, I felt sorrow and pain
Now my love has sailed away
There's no turning back the skies are grey

Autum ashes turn to dust
Streets grow silent with pouring rain
There's a time for everything
There's a place for every broken soul

[CHORUS:]
Don't you waste my time again
Everything we were, we are no more
Everybody hurts
I didn't say love lasts forever
Everybody bleeds
I didn't say I liked it that way

[VERSE 2:]
I can still remember all the things you said
Told me, that we'll be forever
Standing still hoping for change
Through time things will heal then often fades

[CHORUS:]
Don't you waste my time again
Everything we were, we are no more
Everybody hurts
I didn't say love lasts forever
Everybody bleeds
I didn't say I liked it that way

[BRIDGE:]
Nothing to say to you without feeling betrayal in your eyes
Now that I leave you run to me that's just the way love goes
Nothing to say to you without feeling betrayal in your eyes
Now that I leave you run to me that's just the way love goes

[CHORUS:]
Don't you waste my time again
Everything we were, we are no more
Everybody hurts
I didn't say love lasts forever
Everybody bleeds
I didn't say I liked it that way
