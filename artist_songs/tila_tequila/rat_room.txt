Locked up all by myself in this small room 
Feel the ignition twists
Lights out over and down with it.
Everybody leaving me tired and hopeless
Loud noises ringing into my head
Feels like I'm hanging with the dead
Cold air blowing into my face
So I tried to light up the fireplace

Do you know what that feels like 
Everyone is out to get me
Do you know what that feels like
Everyone is out to get me
Do you know what that feels like
Everyone is out to get me
Do you know what that feels like
Everyone is out to get me

Jane says she wants to come out and play
Destroy everything that I made
Maybe I should just let her win
Tired of fighting tired from deep within 
Eyes shut she just won't go away
Get help thats what my friends would say
But I can't I will just let her be
Because jane is actually only me

Only me only me

Do you know what that feels like
Everyone is out to get me
Do you know what that feels like
Everyone is out to get me
Do you know what that feels like
Everyone is out to get me
Do you know what that feels like
Everyone is out to get me

Jane says she wants to come jane says she wants to come out and play
Jane says she wants to come out and play 
Destroy everything that I made

Do you know what that feels like
Everyone is out to get me
Do you know what that feels like
Everyone is out to get me
Do you know what that feels like
Everyone is out to get me
Do you know what that feels like
Everyone is out to get me

Do you know what that feels like
Everyone is out to get me
Do you know that that feels like
Everyone is out to get me

Everyone is out to get me
Do you know what that feels like
Everyone is out to get me
