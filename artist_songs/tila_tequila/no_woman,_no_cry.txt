No woman, no cry

In a government yard in Trenchtown
Observing the hypocrites

No woman no cry
No woman no cry
Little darlin', don't shed no tears
No woman no cry

Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire lights
I seh, log would burnin' thru the nights
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage and
So I've got to push on through
Oh, while I'm gone

No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry

Everything's gonna be alright
