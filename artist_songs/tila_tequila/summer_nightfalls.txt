[Verse 1:]
All our friends keep wondering but they don't know that...
You and I have secret lives yet they don't realize.
When they aren't looking, we keep on kissing, the fun we're having...
Hiding our love from the world is driving me insane...

[Chorus:]
Summer nightfalls with endless dreams...
Of you and I together always.
Taking trips and leaving town...
Go to a place where there's no one around... there's no one around...

[Verse 2:]
I thank you for all the times when you made me smile.
No matter what happens now you will always be my pal.
We run around and cause a ruckus... we can't stop laughing.
These memories will fill our lives with hapiness...

[Chorus:]
Summer nightfalls with endless dreams...
Of you and I together always.
Taking trips and leaving town...
Go to a place where there's no one around... there's no one around...

I thank you for all the times when you made me smile...
no matter what happens now you will always be my pal...

[Chorus:]
Summer nightfalls with endless dreams...
Of you and I together always.
Taking trips and leaving town...
Go to a place where there's no one around... there's no one around...
