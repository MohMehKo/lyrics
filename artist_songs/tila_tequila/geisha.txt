I feel like you want to want me too
But all I know is what I see in you
Every time I want to close my eyes
It's like I feel so lost

Don't you want me anymore?
I see it
I need it
Don't you want me anymore?
I see it
I need it

Don't you want to see where you can go?
So hold close and really hold on tight
Forever in my mind

Don't you want me anymore?
I see it
I need it
Don't you want me anymore?
I see it 
I need it
