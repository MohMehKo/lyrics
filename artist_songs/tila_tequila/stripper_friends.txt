[Chorus:]
All my stripper friends
All my ex-boyfriends
We all want the same thing
We all want the same thing
Body's in the bar
Reaching for the stars
We all want the same thing

[Verse:]
Doesn't matter what you need to get you through your day
If you buy it or just sell it or just give it away
It's the same at the end of the day
Doesn't matter if you pray or if you stop prayin'
Some just standing in their head and they just want stop playin'
it's the same at the end of the day

[Chorus:]
All my stripper friends (hey)
All my ex-boyfriends (oh)
We all want the same thing
We all want the same thing
Body's in the bar (hey)
Reachin' for the stars (oh)
We all want the same thing
We all want the same thing

[Verse:]
Doesn't matter if they care or if they don't care less
You've got your finger on the trigger of your favorite black dress
It's OK at the end of the day
Doesn't matter if you're open or afraid to fall
All that matters is that you stay true to who you are
It's OK at the end of the day

[Chorus:]
All my stripper friends (all my)
All my ex-boyfriends (all my)
we all want the same thing (want it)
We all want the same thing (want the same thing)
Body's in the bar (hey)
Reaching for the stars (oh) (reaching)
We all want the same thing

[Bridge:]
We all want to live
We all want to learn
How to love without getting burned
We want to be loved
Are we good enough?
yeah yeah

[Chorus:]
All my stripper friends (want that)
All my ex-boyfriends (yeah)
We all want the same thing (uh huh)
We all want the same thing (want the same thing)
