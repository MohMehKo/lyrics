Go into the spirit of night
Air surrounds me
make believe in all the way
lights around me
Break down all the pieces too
Lift you up high
Dancing with the fire flies
Pop becomes life?

I cant take it why don’t you get up and listen
put on the base I’m gonna take on a mission
Pump, pump it up play it real loud
jumping up and down come up from the ground

I cant take it why don’t you get up and listen
put on the base I’m gonna take on a mission
Pump, pump it up play it real loud
jumping up and down come up from the ground

Jumping up and down to the beat
Fell all the heat
Dripping sweat all down my veins
Going insane
Disco dancing feel the dreams
We’ll move the streets
Constantly you’ll feel my beat
Fall before me

I cant take it why don’t you get up and listen
put on the base I’m gonna take on a mission
Pump, pump it up play it real loud
jumping up and down come up from the ground

I cant take it why don’t you get up and listen
put on the base I’m gonna take on a mission
Pump, pump it up play it real loud
jumping up and down come up from the ground

Take it, take it all away
Do it, do what I say
Shake it, shake it, don’t break it
Uh Uh

Take it, take it all away
Do it, do what I say
Shake it, shake it, don’t break it
Uh Uh

Take it, take it all away
Do it, do what I say
Shake it, shake it, don’t break it
Ah Uh 

I cant take it why don’t you get up and listen
put on the base I’m gonna take on a mission
pump, pump it up, play it real loud
jumping up and down coming from the ground

I cant take it why don’t you get up and listen
put on the base I’m gonna take on a mission
pump, pump it up, play it loud
jumping up and down coming from the ground
