[Verse 1:]
Creepin' everytime I got a minute to spare
I was tappin' that ass everynight like I didn't care
I call them all baby cause I forget their names
You would do the same so don't call me insane!
I got lingerie on that is ready to tear
So I pushed him on the bed and started pullin' his hair
Then my phone started ringing it was my other man
We gotta finish up as fast as we can!

[Chorus:]
All my playgirls out doing their thing
Who don't give a damn about what people think
We girls have a right to get nasty too!
Cause I don't want no love I just wanna get screwed!

[Verse 2:]
Peepin through my window was a boy named Ben
He was watchin me make out with his best friend Ken
Then I looked behind my shoulder and to my big surprise
I saw a few more people now I'm ready to hide!
So this is how it ends I'm gonna tell you once more
My baby just passed out so I just snuck out the door
There's always something going on as you can see
This is my life now and it's as crazy as me!

[Chorus:]
All my playgirls out doing their thing
Who don't give a damn about what people think
We girls have a right to get nasty too!
Cause I don't want no love I just wanna get screwed!

[Breakdown:]
I've been holding on to the past
You've been gone for so long
Sorry but you fucked it all up
I've got too many boys no time for you!

[Chorus:]
All my playgirls out doing their thing
Who don't give a damn about what people think
We girls have a right to get nasty too!
Cause I don't want no love I just wanna get screwed!
