Sucker free
I don't want to become 23
Turn around
Touch the ground
Everyday you and me
Disco dance
Disco ball
I can be anything
Take a chance
We can dance
Fly and it will set us free
Shut the door
Let it out
Sound off to
Scream and shout
Do or die
Let it ride
Everything is quite alright
Don't you know
We can go into the magna-flow
So just run away run away...

I can cream
I can scream
I'm just like a perfect dream
Marmelade
Escapade
Everything is gone away
Party mouth
Party queen
Everything has got to be
Light it up
Jump around
You can dance inside a crowd
Feel my flow
Don't you know
Everything has got to go
Monkey see
Monkey do
What the hell is wrong with you?
Cherry pie chicken thigh
Cut it up beneath the sky
Beneath the sky sky sky...
Yeah... here we go...

You said youd lie but then you never lied to me
You said youd lie but then you never lied to me
You said youd lie but then you never lied to me
You said youd lie but then you never lied to me
You said youd lie but then you never lied to me
You said youd lie but then you never lied to me
I don't care about
All the peoples lives
Just take what you can
Love will conquer lies
