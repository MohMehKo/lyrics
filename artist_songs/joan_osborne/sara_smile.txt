Baby hair with a womanâ€™s eyes
I can feel you watching in the night
All alone with me and were waiting for the sunlight
When I feel cold you warm me
When I feel I cant go on you come and hold me
It's you... and me forever

Sara smile
Wont you smile a while for me, Sara

If you feel like leaving you know you can go
But why don't you stay until tomorrow?
And if you want to be free, all you have to do is say so
When you feel cold, I'll warm you
And when you feel you cant go on, I'll come and hold you
It's you... and me forever

Sara smile
Wont you smile a while for me, Sara

Sara smile
Wont you smile a while for me, Sara
