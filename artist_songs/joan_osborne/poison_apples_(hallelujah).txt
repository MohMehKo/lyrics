Your memory comes back to me
to strangle me with its sweet taste
See God would never be so cruel
to make me live without your face
Now that I have made you crawl
It does you good to see me fall
Like poison apples from the tree
as heavy as a honey bee

Hallelujah
I gave you away so easily
It makes me wonder why

Moving through you every night
The lovely girls in dresses tight
The angels dancing on a pin
The people we are downing in
Like a needle going in
Into the shining city skin
Oh I recall the moment when you ruined me for other men

Hallelujah
I gave you away so easily
It makes me wonder why

If I die before you do
believe me I'll be haunting you
I'll come upon you while you sleep
to drown you in a kiss
So deep
