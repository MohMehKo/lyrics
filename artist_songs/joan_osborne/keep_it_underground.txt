In my room with your friends,
In that place sais you go undone
If no one's here to hear it does a kiss really make a sound
If you want me to me happy baby
You've got to keep it under, you've got to keep it underground
You got to keep it underground

I come home last night I can tell you got something to say
Got someone that know what you do
When I'm gone away
If you want me to me happy baby
You've got to keep it under, you've got to keep it underground
You got to keep it underground

Yeah, I'm at a day when my word is not allowed with you
Can't remember a day I wouldn't do anything for you
Ain't right in know, think you carry these blues around
But I need it tonight and I'm carry out for you
I'm carry out for you

And with your friends do you find someone just like me?
Can you heard me enough to bring back how we use to be
If you want me to me happy baby
You've got to keep it under, you've got to keep it underground
You got to keep it underground
Keep it underground, keep it underground,
Underground
Keep it underground, keep it underground,
Keep it underground, keep it underground,
