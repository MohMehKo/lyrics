Whenever I'm with him something inside
Starts burning and I'm filled with fire
Could it be the devil in me
Or is this the way it's supposed to be

It's like a heatwave burning in my heart
I can't keep from crying, it's tearing me apart

Whenever he calls my name
Sounds so soft sweet and plain
I feel, right there, I feel this burning pain
This high blood pressure's got a hold on me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be

It's like a heatwave burning in my heart
I can't keep from crying, it's tearing me apart

Sometimes this scaring craze, tears all over my face
Can't explain it, don't understand it
I ain't never felt like this before
And that funny feeling has me amazed
Don't know what to do, my head's in a haze

It's like a heatwave
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ohh..
I'm feeling I'm burning
I feel I'm burning in my heart like a heatwave
Heatwave
I'm feeling
I'm feeling, I'm feeling
