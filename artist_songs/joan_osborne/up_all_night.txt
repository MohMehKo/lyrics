Deep in my dark there is a light
When I have lost the will to fight
You give the blind a second sight
You keep me up all night

Sometimes the moon, sometimes the tide
We are the horse, we are the ride
We are the bird, we’re taking flight
You keep me up all night

Oh, don’t it seem that it’s better than a dream?
Every time with you is made of gold
Oh, don’t it feel nothing’s ever been so real?
‘Cause you take me to the bottom of my soul

You keep me up all night
You keep me up all night
You give the blind a second sight
You keep me up all night

Sometimes the cut, sometimes the knife
Always the hand that holds my life
You keep me up all night
You keep me up all night

Oh, don’t it seem that it’s better than a dream?
Every time with you is made of gold
Oh, don’t it feel nothing’s ever been so real?
‘Cause you take me to the bottom of my soul

You keep me up all night
You keep me up all night
You give the blind a second sight
You keep me up all night

You keep me up all night
You keep me up all night
You give the blind a second sight
You keep me up all night

You keep me up all night
You keep me up all night
