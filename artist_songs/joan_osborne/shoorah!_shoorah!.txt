You got to wake up early in the morning
You got to stay up all night long
Still won't catch up 'cause I got the warnin'
I got the feelin' you wanna do me wrong
Like a ball of lightning and the ball of heat
You wanna knock me right off my feet
But I recognise through the eyes of a fool
That you got the power to make your own rules

Shoorah, Shoorah
Hey, I can feel you comin'
Shoorah, Shoorah
Oh but you won't catch me
Shoorah, Shoorah
Hey, I can hear you hummin'
Shoorah, Shoorah
oh but you won't catch me

I can see you movin', movin' all around me
I know you're trying to get me upset
I can feel you groovin', thinkin' you done found me
I'm here to tell you, you ain't got me yet

Shoorah, Shoorah
Hey, I can feel you comin'
Shoorah, Shoorah
Oh but you won't catch me
Shoorah, Shoorah
Hey, I can hear you hummin'
Shoorah, Shoorah
oh but you won't catch me

I checked you out from the corner of my eye
You and the devil walkin' side by side
you ain't changed, let's be real about it
And I can't change how I feel about it

Shoorah, Shoorah
Yeah, I can feel you comin'
Shoorah, Shoorah
Oh but you won't catch me
Shoorah, Shoorah
Yeah, I can hear you hummin'
Shoorah, Shoorah
oh but you won't catch me
Shoorah, Shoorah
Yeah, I can feel you comin'
Shoorah, Shoorah
Oh but you won't catch me
Shoorah, Shoorah
Yeah, I can hear you hummin'
Shoorah, Shoorah
oh but you won't catch me
