Wanna tell you bout a dance it's been going around
Everybody doing it from grownups down
Ain't gotta move your head ain't gotta move your hands
Ain't gotta move your lips just move your hips
Do the hips shake baby
Do the hips shake baby
Shake your hips baby
Shake your hips baby

If you don't know don't be afraid
Just listen to me do what I see
Don't you move your hip don't you move your hands
Don't you move your lips just move your hips
Do the hips shake baby
Do the hips shake baby
Shake your hips baby
Shake your hips baby

Ain't that easy now say is easy now
Met a little girl in the country town
She said what do you know about...
She didn't move her head didn't move her hands
Didn't move her lips just move her hips
Do the hips shake baby
Do the hips shake baby
Shake your hips baby
Shake your hips baby
Do the hips shake baby
Do the hips shake baby
Shake your hips baby
Shake your hips baby
Ain't that easy now
