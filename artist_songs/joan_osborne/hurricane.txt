I am a genius
I am a diamond
My pretty tongue gives you a freezer burn
I think above you in three dimensions
Come in here, you can never return

Like a hurricane
in the face of the wind and the rain
like a hurricane

When you open you open a vein
I see your headlights across my ceiling
you are a puppet of a wish I made
They never touch me, they say I'm crazy
I was born from my mother's brain, my mother's brain

Like a hurricane
in the face of the wind and the rain
like a hurricane

When you open you open a vein
You plant a seed in my mind
I walk around and I speak your message
For myself I don't know what to say
I walk around and I speak your message

Like a hurricane
in the face of the wind and the rain
like a hurricane
When you open you open a vein
Give me more give me more Novocain
