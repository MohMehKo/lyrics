Your love is like a chunk of gold
Hard to gain, and hard to hold

Like a rose that's soft to touch
Love has thorns, that can hurts so much

Well and Why?
Must the same love that made me laugh have that make me cry?

Well, you think of love as sitting on a mountain
Think of it as being a great big rock
Won't you think before you started to roll it down
Because once you start it, you can't make it stop

I've given all I have to give
And if you don't want me
I don't want to live

Oh, you think of love as sitting on a mountain
Think of it as being a great big rock
Won't you think before you started to roll it down
Because once you start it, you can't make it stop

I've given all I have to give
And if you don't want me
I don't want to live

Well and Why?
Must the same love that made me laugh have that make me cry?

Oh now
Must the same love that made me laugh why wanna make me cry?

Ohhh why wanna make me cry?
Tell me now
