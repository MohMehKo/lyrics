Floating above you
beyond the naked eye
Blue dreams about you
keep playing in my mind

Oh if I was
Oh if I was your man
Oh if I was
Oh if I was your man

I'm just a satellite
so lazy in the breeze
Ready to fly away, I need your gravity
When I run down the path
the turns look all the same
And if I lose my way
your mind will call my name

Oh if I was
Oh if I was your man
Oh if I was
Oh if I was your man

Let's go outside to a dark place
Where the kitty cat hides
put on your fake wings
give the moon a ride

When you're lonely for the angel inside
3:30 in the morning is too easy for you
But when it comes without a warning
What are you gonna do this time? You gonna do this time?

Floating above you
beyond the naked eye
Blue dreams about you
comes rushing through my mind
Branded with thoughts of you
They're tattooed on my sou;
Why don't they seem to fade
Is what I'll never know

Oh if I was
Oh if I was your man
Oh if I was
Oh if I was your man
Oh if I was
Oh if I was your man
