The way a whiskey tingles downward
The way a storm can boil a sea
The way the summer makes everybody younger
That is how you work on me!
The way your freight train rocks the coal cars
The way a river carves its bed
The way a hand fits inside a pocket
That is how you live in my head.

If I had known I would miss you like this
I would have made movies of every kiss.

The way a cloud engulfs a jet plane
The way a woman sips her tea
The way a song fills the atmosphere
That is how you work on me!

If I had known I would miss you like this
Ah, ah, ah, ah
I would have made movies of every kiss.
Ah, ah, ah, ah

The way the wind can whip the branches
The way a kind word sets me free
After the rain, all the world is new again
That is how you work on me, how you work on me!
Oh, how you work on me!
How you work on me!
