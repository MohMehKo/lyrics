Ever since you woke me up in the night 
Stirring up my soul like a dream I can't fight 
I've been walking round like a ghost in my house
Covered in my sheets trying to figure it out 
Starring at the spiders up on the wall 
Wondering if they've got these feelings at all 
Wishing to escape this just for a night 
You don't know what you do to me.

One day I had you kissing me so openly 
Thought that my life was done 
The next day you change like a season of rain 
My hearts now a soaking drum 
The moons dimmed to yellow 
The snow lies so stagnant 
The wind has quit blowin and I don't know where you are.

The fire keeps on burning everyday after you leave 
The fire keeps on hurting and I can't get no relief 

The fire keeps on burning everyday after you leave.

Ever since you woke me up here inside 
Took my dusty room and you turned on the light 
I've been walking round like a ghost in my house 
Covered in my sheets trying to figure it out 
Starring at the spiders up on the wall 
Wondering if they've got these feelings at all 
Wishing to escape this just for a night
You don't know what you've done to me.

Monday I had you holding me so tightly hoping I would never leave 
Somehow you're gone ya moved on you're so wrong 
You've no reason for anything 
The stars falling down now
Chaos in my head now 
My head in the haze baby I don't know where you are.
