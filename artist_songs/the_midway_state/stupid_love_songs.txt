Back alleys are so dark at twelve and one o’clock,
I’m empty handed with only a glass but no I won't drink.
Its seven-thirty again I’m dreaming that I had a life instead I’ll sit here on the edge of my bed singing stupid love songs that don't ever end.

I don't want to hate you.
I wish that I could love you.

Instead I’ll wallow in misery and dance to the rhymes of your sweet nurseries,
well I’ve tried begging down your stone cold eyes but I should have known that
I’d look to far from what's inside of your heart.
From what's inside of your heart.
From what's inside of your heart.
Yeah. what's inside of your heart.
