Boys go with girls better than you think.
I wish it weren’t so easy to fall in like, and then to love.

Do you like me?
I love you so much sometimes.
What happened today?
It’s like every time we die.
I’ll try harder again.
It’s like every time you die on me.

I couldn't take this on my own.
I need some guidance from someone.
Well, what happened today?
It’s like every time we die.
I’ll try harder again.
It’s like every time you die on me.

Take off your shoes and loose your socks.
Pull out your guts and dry them on the rocks so you can live like all the rest:
with bare insides and cute outsides. Dress up your bed for a one night stand.
That’s all he’s “interested in”, and his last words still, you thought they were honest, well honestly.

I couldn't take this on my own.
I need some guidance from someone.
Well, what happened today?
It’s like every time we die.
I’ll try harder again.
It’s like every time you die on me.

This lonely wind is turning your eyes.
My stomach's churning.
A pretty haze runs over my head as waves rush under.
Take off your shoes and loose all your self-respect in one night.
It’s how you’re thinking tonight, and when you’re thinking I wish I was drinking.

I couldn't take this on my own.
I need some guidance from someone.
Well, what happened today?
It’s like every time we die.

I didn't want to win you over. No, not at all.
I didn't want to win you over. No, not at all.
Not at all.
Not at all.
Not at all.
