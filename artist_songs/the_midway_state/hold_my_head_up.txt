How the hell'd you find me 
I've been hiding miles away
Maybe you don't know it
I still think about you every single day
Why the hell'd you leave me
No information 
Nothing for my wall

You tell me how you've grown girl 
Well I can't say that I've grown much at all 
I've just been trying to hold my head up

I've been trying to hold my head up 
Oh I've been trying to keep my prayers up
I've been trying to hold my head up.

How the hell'd you find me 
I've been digging trenches everyday 
Trying to protect me because I miss your every little way 
Your blue eyes your big dreams 

You said I don't aspire to be enough 
And now you wanna hire me 
Once again to take care of your little heart 
Well I don't know 
I've been trying to hold my head up.

Nows the time 
When you'd say anything to get me back 
Nows the time 
Yeah the time 
When you'd say anything to get us back.
Its the time 
Ya you'll say anything to get us back 
Nows the time, yeah
You'd say anything to get me back there.
