In this world if the moon rose at just one time
And we'd both fall asleep at the same midnight
If the towns we were in had all the same names
We could see eye to eye baby lose the games
If the tears from your eyes fell into my hand
I'd feel the warmth of the one that they were in
If the words from your mouth came from lips I could see
I think the meaning of them would relax jealousy

If there was a way we could change our lives
To better fit our love
Fit it all inside
If I could come home to you
And hold you in my arms when you fall asleep

There would be no crying
There would be no hurting no fear
There would be no crying
Just gotta get through this next year

If the state lines that we were born into
Were ten miles high and we could not get through
I'd be by your side still this very day
Playing only for you making minimum wage
If the girl that you hear in the back of the bus
Has a voice that you don't think you can trust
Babe I wish you were here so you could see
All I talk about is you when she's not with me

If the rain from your heart fell into my hand
I'd take the pain of the lover that it was in 
I'd be home with you girl and every night
Hold you tight it would hurt

But there would be no crying
There would be no hurting no fear
There would be no crying
Just gotta get through this next year

If there was a way we could change our lives
To better fit our love
Fit it all inside
If I could come home to you
And hold you in my arms when you fall asleep

There would be no crying
There would be no hurting no fear
There would be no crying
Just gotta get through this next year

In this world if the moon rose at just one time
And we'd both fall asleep at the same midnight
If the towns we were in had all the same names
We could see eye to eye baby lose the games
