The Girl that I once loved
Was nothing more than a magician in disguise.
She became a bird,
Flew into my life,
And then she disappeared.
She left me standin' here.

I'm a statue in this town
With an old cemented frown,
Standin' in Central Square.
I feel all the children stare.
I've seen misery too long,
Like an old and minor song
The days your here with me,
Have led to all this misery.
And,

I regret every second I spent with you.
You'll regret those things you put me through.
If I close my eyes,
I can see your face.
It's been a while,
But it's an image I'll never replace.

Sunny days are warm.
They take away the sores.
And I live, an empty shell.
Nothin' feels so well.
Of course it comes, the rain,
And with it all the pain.
Rememberin' who i am,
And who you were to me.
And,

I regret every second I spent with you.
You'll regret those things you put me through.
If I close my eyes,
I can see your face.
It's been a while,
But it's bleedng and in disgrace.

I regret every second I spent with you.
You'll regret those things you put me through.
If I close my eyes,
I can see your face.
It's been a while,
But it's bleeding and in disgrace.

And I regret every second I spent with you.
You'll regret those things you put me through.
Yes, I regret every second I spent with you,
But I regret, 
And I'm still in love with you.
