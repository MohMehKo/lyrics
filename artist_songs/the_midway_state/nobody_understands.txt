Can't cool off. You're on fire.
No cold tears gonna put you out.
You're awake, in love, you're wired.
Kissed her goodnight, now you walk by yourself.

You're so confused cause they told you,
"be careful you know she's a mess.
She is a bad situation, that girl is always depressed."
But there's something you feel, they can't see it
She is the one that ignites what you got inside.
What you just can't hide.

The way you love her, nobody understands.
The way you feel her, oh it's above their heads.
The way you bleed her, nobody understands you boy. Nobody understands.

You're awake and you're on fire,
Burning up with how you feel.
Yeah she's a freak and she's a liar,
But you're in love with the girl she's concealed.

You're so confused cause they told you,
"her father was bad he was messed.
She is a hard situation, that girl is always depressed."
Where do you go when there's no one?
When no one believes in your love?
It all shines out when you kiss her mouth.

The way you love her, nobody understands.
The way you feel her, oh it's out of your hands
The way you bleed her, nobody understands you boy. Nobody understands.

The way you love her, nobody understands.
The way you feel her, oh it's above their heads.
The way you bleed her, nobody understands you boy. Nobody understands.

The way you love her, nobody understands.
The way you feel her, oh it's above their heads.
The way you bleed her, nobody understands you boy. Nobody understands.
Nobody understands you boy. Nobody understands.
Nobody understands you boy. Nobody understands.
