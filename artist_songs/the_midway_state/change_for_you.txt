So here we fall, and here we break
and all that we had, is now just a mistake
I guess it got boring and old
So what have you done, you left me alone

You got your things, you got them all
You know thers nothing you wont have
And I'm afraid I don't got the cash
To keep you happy in the sack
'Cause you show me the ill not free, that you need big fat limousines
To keep you high, to keep you safe, keep you in love

What if i change for you
Then will you see me still with you
I'd never do it, I'm no fool

So here we fall, and here we break
And all that we had, is now just a mistake
You look so young, feel so misled
And your stuffy friends have gone to your head

You got your things, you got them all
You know thers nothing you wont have
and Im afraid I dont got the cash
to keep you happy, and Im upset
cause you show me the I'll not free, that you need big fat limousines
to keep you high, to keep you safe, keep you in love

What if I change for you
Then will you see me still with you
I 'd never do it, I'm no fool

Honey, I'm not you

I walk away, thinking back to the days, that I held you close
with your puffy white coat, and you told me Joe, I could never let go
"I need you more, then life it's self", and the rain poured down
and I kept you dry, and I took the tears fallen from your eyes, and the snow came down
and I kept you warm, and I kept you safe from your daddy's storm, when he said to you
that you cant see me, "No, this pool boys got nothing good to be", now they got to you
and what do you say, you want some rich guy instead of me.

What if I change for you
Then will you see me still with you.
I'd never do it, I'm no fool

What if I change for you
Then will you see me still with you
I 'd never do it, I'm no fool

Honey, I'm not you
