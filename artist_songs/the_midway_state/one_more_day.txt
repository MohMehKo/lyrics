There's a lot things I've done,
That are harder to regret because I know now they were wrong.
I meant to make you hurt and I meant to make you sweat, 
But I didn't mean to scar.
I know there's no one else here to blame.
Forgive me I know I caused all your pain.
You know I learned so much from the past,
And now I need help to change.

Just one more day to change my ways,
And I swear I will be there to help you, please. 
Just one more night to change my life, 
And I swear I will be there to help you up.

There's a lot of times I thought you deserved no real respect, 
And I pushed you down real hard.
I can see hurt in your eyes and how it never went away,
But for me it was a game.
Forgive me now I have grown and I see,
The deepness cutting you up made you bleed. 
You know I suffer from what I've done, 
And now I need help to change.

Just one more day to change my ways,
And I swear I will be there to help you, please. 
Just one more night to change my life, 
And I swear I will be there to help you up.

There's a little bit of hurt inside every of these bones, 
And it's all from what I've done.
It's 'cause I had no heart in the place that I called home,
So I took it out on you.
I still paid all of the cuts and the names. 
I was not confident in my place. 
I took all of my fears out on you,
And now and now I need help to change.

Just one ore day to change my ways 
And I swear I will help you, please. 
Just one more night to change my life, 
And I swear I will be there to help you up.
One more day, one more way I'll find it.
Just one more day to change my ways.
