Follow, you were always one to call out and always one to hold on for your life.
You’re reckless; reckless you’re not waiting, waiting for the red lit young street light.
But I don’t remember a time when the young didn’t become old.
I’ve forgotten the footprints laid down. There you go,
on your own caught in the morning sun.
There you go.
I watch you grow and I realize I’m happy now.
Grown up, hoping you remember.
I sit here in the old house going to slow down and let me love you?
I’m old and I’m wrinkled.
I’m star your childhood home. I wonder.
You’re living on your own now.
When are you struck by all of your young grace.
Why can't I watch you proceed on your own?
Now that I’m over the edge. Now out of time.
