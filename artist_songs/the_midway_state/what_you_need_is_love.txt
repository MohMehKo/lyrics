I don't want you calling everyday
I don't want you, knew me anyway
I, I don't think you understand me babe
It's true I've played you now I regret
The stupid things I said

Yeah...

I don't want to see you everyday
No, I'm not used to watching what I say
I, I don't want you acting like my babe
You've been confused, you don't need me,
You don't need again

What you need is love (is love)
And with me you don't stand a chance 
Of getting that love (that love)
Cause I've been looking for romance
What you need is love
And here you don't stand no chance

And girl, I'm sorry, love was just a game
And I just wanted a little of you babe
My, my love sung true 
And this is not the place for you to find love girl 
No, my heart is gone so far away

What you need is love (is love)
And with me you don't stand a chance
Of getting that love (that love)
Casue I've been looking for romance
What you need is love
And here you don't stand no chance

Yeah...

I wish this would all be found, it wont now
I wish I could toll your laugh but I cant girl
See I've been here so many times
I don't feel real low

What you need is love
And with me you don't stand a chance
Of getting that love
Casue I've been looking for romance

What you need is love
And here you stand no chance

What you need is love (is love)
And with me you don't stand a chance
Of getting that love (that love)
Casue I've been looking for romance
What you need is love
And here you don't stand no chance

What you need is love (is love)
And with me you don't stand a chance
Of getting that love (that love)
Casue I've been looking for romance
What you need is love
And here you don't stand no chance
