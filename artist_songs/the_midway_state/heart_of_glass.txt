When you, you know that you've finally found it
When you, you say can't live without it
I know, you lie there and you just can't fight it
You love her and you just can't hide it
It's a dangerous place

With a heart of glass
No you can't turn back
When the walls are shaking
With a heart of glass

So I stand here in the driveway watching you go
I know, I know I can't stop ya
Tell me what night do you not remember?
My eyes used to make you shiver
That was a dangerous place

With a heart of glass
No you can't turn back
When the walls are shaking
With a heart of glass

When you, you know that you've finally found it
When you, you lie there and you just can't fight it

With a heart of glass
No you can't turn back
When the walls are shaking
With a heart of glass

With a heart of glass
No you can't turn back
When the walls are shaking
With a heart of glass
