Did you feel the nurse at night?
She stroked and held your hand.
Did you feel the doctor's might?
He cried, you understand?
That everything ain't always right.
Aw hell, it never is.
You are gonna die tonight,
just like your parents did.

Remember the morning breeze
on your face when you cry and
tell me you don't want to leave,
though you're so worn and tattered on this night.

Think about the times we shared.
The moons, they shone so bright.
Think about the love we share.
Our love, it overrides.

Remember the morning breeze
on your face when you're cry and
tell me you don't want to leave,
though you're so worn and tattered.
If you only knew,
I doubt that you'd be dying.
I'm such a selfish fool
to think that you're not trying to stay.

Is it over?
Do you know that I'm right here and
I'm scared tonight,
that you won't make it.
You're loosing this fight.
You're burning out before me, you're a million fireflies.
You're leaving now but I can't say goodbye.

Remember the morning breeze on your face when you cry and
Tell me you don't want to leave, though you're so worn and tattered
It hurts me loving you. It burns a million fireflies.
It hurts me loving you. It burns a million fireflies.
It hurts me loving you. It burns a million fireflies.
It hurts me loving you. It burns a million fireflies.
It hurts me loving you. Oh damn you for loving me.
