Love, why you go so fast
Pain, why you gotta last
Stone heart, why you bleeding now
And when I walk away from you
No, you never asked me to
Oh yeah

Sun, just go back to bed
Your light is hurting my head
I need to talk to you girl
And when I walk away from you
When I knew there was something
You never asked me to
Oh yeah

You know, I can't stop waking up to you
Love, you were gone
I cannot face the truth, honey
I can't stop waking up to you in my mind
So when I walk away from you, no

Love, where'd you go so fast
Pain, why you gotta last
Those blue eyes, why can't I see them now
And when I walk away from you
When I knew there was something
You never asked me to
Oh yeah

You know, I can't stop waking up to you
Love, you were gone
I cannot face the truth, honey
I can't stop waking up to you in my mind
So when I walk away from you, no

When I walk away from you, no
It's like I looked right through
Oh yeah

You know, I can't stop waking up to you
Love, you were gone
I cannot face the truth, honey
I can't stop waking up to you in my mind
So when I walk away from you, no

You never asked me to
