I saw the ocean swallow you.
through the haze, I search for you,
trying to find where I had you.

Hard London rain beat colour out
through the night my body shouts
telling me to hold you now

If you could feel my fire reach for you
flames draw high out to you
streetlight shines through my window,
it trembles for you
take my heart, there you go.
London's wild, but I'm alone.
You're so far but I'm not tired,
I'm coming for you.

All over waves and straight across
to the steps where we were lost
in the night, our bodies locked
all in your eyes the colours are
like the red runs through my heart
now it beats for you my love

Tonight I feel restless Atlantic hum
across these waters for you we're still young

If you could feel my fire reach for you
flames draw high out to you
streetlight shines through my window,
it trembles for you
take my heart, there you go.
London's wild, but I'm alone.
You're so far but I'm not tired,
I'm coming for you.
