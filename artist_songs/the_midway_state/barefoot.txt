I remember the last time in the city
Well I thought about your face
And then about your legs
And how you talk to me and sing to me
About the ways yeah
That you like my smile
And how I am so young.

And how we have choices,
And how we have choices
Yeah we have choices baby.

Do you want to make out with me
In the darkest nights with the darkest lights turned off?
Do you want to hold onto me
And we'll remember this day for twenty years now on.
I understand completely
If you don't want to its getting late now
But baby if you want to just whisper
"Nate, I want to make out with you"
And that'd be fine.

So I stripped off my shoes and socks
And I walked barefoot through the street
Only thinking about you.
And so I grabbed the closest girl to me
And kissed her way too hard,
Only thinking about you
And how you kiss so well,
And how I love you,
Yeah how I love you.
Oh gosh I love you so much.

Do you want to make out with me
In the darkest nights with the darkest lights turned off?
Do you want to hold onto me
And we'll remember this day for twenty years now on.
I understand completely
If you don't want to its getting late now
But baby if you want to just whisper
"Nate, I want to make out with you"
And that'd be fine.

Now I see how this works my dear
I'll walk the city night by night,
And call your name up apartment walls
In hopes that someone might just jump,
Into my arms so lightly.
Maybe you could fall out tonight.
Hopefully your not high enough to fall,
But this is how I feel.

Do you want to make out with me
In the darkest nights with the darkest lights turned off?
Do you want to hold onto me
And we'll remember this day for twenty years now on.
I understand completely
If you don't want to its getting late now
But baby if you want to just whisper
"Nate, I want to make out with you"
And that'd be fine.

Whisper "Nate, I'll be fine."
