I walk up
up the stairs here
cause I see you left the light on
hoping that I come in there
and lie down by your side
there's a hole deep inside me you once filled
filled me all up
in the dark of the night girl we'd whisper forever forever forever.

Where did we go
I lost you, I lost you
where did we go
I need it, I need it
where did we go
I lost you, I lost you oh
where did we go
can't go on without you.

I walk in you're already sleepin
so you can't hear me singing
girl I bet you are dreaming
do you still dream about me
Do you believe and still remember
all that we said about surrendering to each other
like real lovers
forever forever forever

Where did we go
We lost it, We lost it
where did we go
I need it, We need it
where did we go
I lost you, I lost you oh
where did we go
can't go on without you. Yeah. Heh! Yeah!
can't go on without you. Yeah. Heh! Yeah!

Where did we go
We lost it, We lost it
where did we go
I need it, We need it
where did we go
I lost you, I lost you oh
where did we go
can't go on without you. Yeah. Heh! Yeah!
can't go on without you. Yeah. Heh! Yeah!

Where did we go
I lost you, I lost you
where did we go
I need it, We need it
where did we go
I want you, I want you oh
where did we go
I can live without out you. Yeah. Heh! Yeah!
I can live without out you. Yeah. Heh! Yeah!
