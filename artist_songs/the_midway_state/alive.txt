We were driving, you were smiling.
There was comfort in your silence.
It was raining, the sun was rising,
Happiness is just on horizon.

Ooh, I never felt so right
Ooh, I never felt so alive

See us running, it's like we're dancing,
We're going wild on joy, it's like we're children
It was raining, while the sun was rising,
Happiness is just on horizon.

Ooh, I never felt so right
Ooh, I never felt so alive
