Summer sun was high when I saw you
Bleached your hair your eyes shot of sky blue 
I stayed awake for months to just absorb you
You made my love grow fast it's what they all do

At least they change in the real world
Before your private school with the rich girls
In the back of your mind you think I'm waiting for you

Baby baby, why would you call
If you knew there was no choice but leaving in the fall.
Save your tears they're not worth crying.
Time your Intuition
And I'm with my way
Live my life now just faster its gone away
Goodbye baby, I will forget you.

Summer sun was hot when I saw you
You had big sunglasses on I couldn't see through
How does first love trigger all in
It didn't stop my heart from growing

At least they change in the real world
Before your private school with the rich girls
In the back of your mind you think I'm waiting for you

Baby baby, why would you call
If you knew there was no choice but leaving in the fall.
Save your tears they're not worth crying.
Time your Intuition
And I'm with my way
Live my life now just faster its gone away
Goodbye baby, I will forget you.

No no, I will forgot you
I swear, I swear I will forget you
I will forget you
