Come back home today
I love you again
Please cause I'm afraid
I haven't slept in days
I know that the only time
Im on steady ground
Is when you're under me
I don't care if you sinned
I'll love you again
In fact I love you now
So just tell me how
I'm trying to find the way that I
Make you realize
That we're still meant to be

I was unaware that you were lost
And that you held it all from me
I was unaware and unprepared
For what I walked in on baby
yeah, yeah, yeah

Like an empire
We crumble and we fall
Thats not all we've got
Mistakes don't break us all
We have got a love inside
It's a yellow light
It keeps us warm again
Cause I'm not made of stone
I ain't got no throne
With help we can rebuild
Diminish all the guilt
It'll all work out cause babe
I'm a forgiving man
It helps that I'm in love

I was unaware that you were lost
And that you held it all from me
I was unaware and unprepared
For what I walked in on baby
yeah,yeah,yeah

I was unaware that you were lost
And that you held it all from me
I was unaware of your affair
And how you held him more than me
yeah,yeah,yeah

I was unaware that you were lost
And that you held it all from me
I was unaware of your affair
And how you held him more than me
I was unaware still paying the cost
Paid with the loss of you baby
I was unaware of your affair
And how you held him more than me
yeah,yeah,yeah
