Hey you surround me like a blanket in my bed
The look in your eyes has stayed inside me
In my head
Outside it's snowing it's odd for this time of year
Your light through the darkness
Getting smaller oh I fear

[Chorus]
Love love pulled us down in the gutter
Can you see us getting out oh I wonder
It's a long long lonely fight down inside me
Can I get you to bring back light or is this never again

Hey you're my weakness
Still my lover in my mind
And you still control me
Summer I put you so high
Hey did you forget you could never get enough
Well I'll always love you
No matter how far you run

[Chorus]

There is a lover down inside all of our gates that we can't protect forever cause
He's sucking at the air from our lips
I felt him tremble when I first picked you up driving honey
We drove for hours I remember when I first let him kiss
You and your mouth the taste of love if filled me up to the tips

I couldn't sleep for weeks
Fevered at one hundred and six
You surround me like a blanket in my bed

[Chorus]
