Met a man on top the hill.
Met a man he said, "take this pill".
Met a man who'd turned away. He stole my sun from everyday.

Met a man he had dark brown eyes.
Met a man he was throwing lies.
Met a man he was good with fire and
He warmed me up he did inspire.

Met a man on top the hill.
Met a man and his cup was spilled.
Met a man and he took me home and he made me feel alone, alone.
Met a man and he took my hand. Said,
"These folks they don't understand.
Come here boy, you just come with me.
With my help you don't have to be."

He said,
"come here kid, and I'm gonna teach you, with all my fancy fire.
Come here kid, and I'm gonna seat you on top this hill,
I can cause you are blind and boy you are desperate.
You're troubled at home and I know whats wrong.
I see you fading so I'll help you up tonight.
Come up here in the air tonight."

Met a man, I was overwhelmed.
Met a man and yes he helped.
Met a man and he helped my cry
The driest tears out from my eyes.
Met a man and he looked so kind,
Understanding I was blind.
Met a man covered in red
And he found a way inside my head.
Met a man on top the hill.
Met a man and his cup was spilled.
Met a man and he took me home and he made me feel alone, alone.
Met a man and he took my hand. Said,
"These folks they don't understand.
Come here boy, you just come with me.
With my help you don't have to be."

He said,
"Come here kid, and I'm gonna teach you, with all my fancy fire.
Come here kid, and I'm gonna seat you on top this hill.
I can cause you are blind and boy you are desperate.
You're troubled at home and I know whats wrong.
I see you fading so I'll help you up tonight.

Come up here in the air."
"You're troubled and boy you are desperate.
You're troubled at home and I know whats wrong.
I see you fading so I'll help you up tonight.
Come up here in the air
Come up here in the air
Come up here in the air tonight."
