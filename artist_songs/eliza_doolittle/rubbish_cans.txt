When I catch the lift to reach a higher floor, 
I always push the button to close the door,
I'd rather run away from saying hello,
I'd rather be cold and wait for the bus
and there's no such thing as a stranger I trust 

I tried to put my make-up on, to cover up whats wrong,
Doesn't stop it running down, with the thunder clouds,
I need to chill against the rubbish cans
And learn to live with dirty hands,
I tried to put my make-up on, but I'm not fooling anyone 

Didn't I know, 
Didn't I know,
Why didn't I know,
Didn't I know,
Why 

Theres no profession when I'm afraid
(when I'm, when I'm afraid of the days) 
I let my pride come and take the reigns
(my pride come take the reigns)
Now you can offer a shoulder for me to lean
Thats what I need to give it away
Cause I kept inside with a lock and chain 

I tried to put my make-up on, to cover up whats wrong,
Doesn't stop it running down, with the thunder clouds,
I need to chill against the rubbish cans
And learn to live with dirty hands,
I tried to put my make-up on, but I'm not fooling anyone 

Didn't I know 
why didn't I know
A scar, a scar's are down my face
Didn't I know  
Why didn't I know?
And I cant avoid the mess I've made

I tried to put my make-up on, to cover up whats wrong,
doesn't stop it running down, with the thunder clouds,
I need to chill against the rubbish cans, 
And learn to live with dirty hands
I tried to put my make-up on, but I'm not fooling anyone 

Didn't I know 
Why didn't I know
Didn't I know..no no
