As far as I remember,
We both speak English,
But you're talking a language,
That I can't distinguish

Well it baffles me that you'll be wasting,
All your time with this negative hating,
And oh I don't know why you do it,
It makes you look so fucking stupid

Your mouth is moving,
But I can't hear,
What you're saying,
Hush your lips,
Cause it's all bullshit,
So leave your ego at the front door,
I don't really care for it,
Cause it's all bullshit

Please stop all of your bitching,
You're talking in fiction,
Don't want to hear your tale tells

I can't see the vodka but you've had a refill
It's cause you're lapping up somebody else's spilt milk

Must be drunk off that insecure liquor
When you knock someone down to feel bigger,
And no I don't know why you do it,
It makes you look so fucking stupid

Your mouth is moving,
But I can't hear,
What you're saying,
Hush your lips,
Cause it's all bullshit,
So leave your ego at the front door,
I don't really care for it,
Cause it's all bullshit

I thought I knew you but I never really knew you yeah
It seems as if you've changed your name,
And it offends me that you'd bring this bad energy
And think I'd participate

Please stop all of your bitching,
You're talking in fiction,
Don't want to hear your tale tells

Your mouth is moving,
But I can't hear,
What you're saying,
Hush your lips,
Cause it's all bullshit,
So leave your ego at the front door,
I don't really care for it,
Cause it's all bullshit
