Oh, Mr Medicine
I'm so happy you came here
You went from 'Every man'
To 'Every man's saviour'

From the Artic to Everest
We're all lookin' for change, sir
More doors will start to open
This cycle has now been broken

First job when you get up
There's a pile of dirty laundry
I know you'll clean it up
You're the man to do it for me

I trust your judgment
I like the things you say
It's common sense
I could take three times a day

Oh, Mr Medicine
I will take anything
What do you recommend?

Oh, Mr Medicine
I need my vitamins
Will I feel better then?

Oh, Mr Medicine
I feel so much better
My friend's a pessimist
But you still impress her

If you need evidence
Then I'll write you a letter
I'll lick the stamp and post it
Just so that you can know this

First job when you get up
There's a pile of dirty laundry
I know you'll clean it up
You're the man to do it for me

And then I saw
That the patient has improved
To call in sick
Has become a lame excuse

Oh, Mr Medicine
I will take anything
What do you recommend?

Oh, Mr Medicine
I need my vitamins
Will I feel better then?

This untidy table's turning
You used the best detergent
Now it's shiny, it's not dirty
And we know that you can work it
Oh, Mr Medicine
(Oh, Mr Medicine)
Oh, Mr Medicine
(Oh, Mr Medicine)

Oh, Mr Medicine
I will take anything
What do you recommend?

Oh, Mr Medicine
I need my vitamins
Will I feel better then?

Oh, Mr Medicine, oh, Mr Medicine
Oh, Mr Medicine, oh, Mr Medicine
Oh, Mr Medicine, oh, Mr Medicine
Oh, Mr Medicine, oh, Mr Medicine

Oh, Mr Medicine
I will take anything
What do you recommend?

Oh, Mr Medicine
I need my vitamins
Will I feel better then?
