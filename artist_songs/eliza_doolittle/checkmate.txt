Just a little boy in a big girls land,
Playin' at being king I took my kingdom back,
Throwing arrows at the window,
But they're not getting in though,
You made a move too late,
And now you're in checkmate

Bugging like a fly against my window pane,
Pain is what you gave me when you left that day,
That day I made a promise,
To raise my fisty cuffs,
You won't fool me twice,
Once is quite enough

Cause you're just a little boy in a big girls land,
Playin' at being king I took my kingdom back,
Throwing arrows at the window,
But they're not getting in though,
You made a move too late,
And now you're in checkmate

Someone stupid told me that romance was dead,
They took him to the tower and cut off his head,
But I don't believe it,
And I've got the proof,
Standing right beside me,
When I compare him to you

You're just a little boy in a big girls land,
Playin' at being king I took my kingdom back,
Throwing arrows at the window,
But they're not getting in though,
You made a move too late,
And now you're in checkmate
[x2]

Oh you're never gonna make it over these walls of mine

You should runaway,
Cause you'll never get past me and my army, my army,
Yea you should runaway,
Cause you'll never get past me and my army, my army,
Yea you should runaway,
Cause you'll never get past me and my army, my army,
You should runaway,
Cause you'll never get past me and my army, my army

You're just a little boy in a big girls land,
Playin' at being king I took my kingdom back,
Throwing arrows at the window,
But they're not getting in though,
You made a move too late,
And now you're in checkmate
