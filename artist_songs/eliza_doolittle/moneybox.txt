Instead of goin' out
To dinner tonight
We can grow vegetables
Underneath our skylight

Clickin' these downloads
Everyday has it's price
We can lounge on our couch
And listen to our 45's

So take your Dollar, your Yen
Those Euros I can't spend
I won't get down with no Pounds
Never need to leave this house

Don't need your moneybox
'Cause I got lots and lots
Of what I need right here
Right here with you, my dear

Don't need the cash machine
To make our days happy
So do me a favour
Don't jingle your change, Sir

Instead of goin'
To the movies tonight
There's no shame in us playin'
Best of that Sega Mega Drive

Hand me your trousers
You got holes in your knees
It's no fuss, patch them up
Forget about that shoppin' spree

So take your Dollar, your Francs
Your Rupees, no thanks
I won't get down with no Pounds
Never need to leave this house

Don't need your moneybox
'Cause I got lots and lots
Of what I need right here
Right here with you, my dear

I know I don't need the cash machine
To make our days happy
So do me a favour
Don't jingle your change, Sir

Don't have your moneybox
It's not much of a loss
All that dough just goes to waste
'Cause you're worth more anyway

Don't need to travel
'Round London tonight
We can play Monopoly
Buy Mayfair in our own time

So take your Dollar, your Baht
I couldn't give a penny
That's enough, leave it out
Never need to leave this house

Don't need your moneybox
'Cause I got lots and lots
Of what I need right here
Right here with you, I know

I know I don't need the cash machine
To make our days happy
So do me a favour
Don't jingle your change, Sir

Don't need the moneybox
'Cause I got lots and lots
Of what I need right here
Right here with you, I know

I know I don't need the cash machine
To make our days happy
So do me a favour
Don't jingle your change, Sir

Do me a favour
Don't jingle your change, Sir
