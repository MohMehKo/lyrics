I'm wishing away,
Everyday, everyday that we're apart,
What can I say?
When I know I should be living every second like it's my last,
What we have is amazing babe,
But it comes and goes like an aeroplane,
I'm done with small doses,
Dipping my toes in,
I'm about to dive from the white cliffs of Dover

Sometimes I wish I was Jesus
I'd get my Airmax on and run across the sea for you,
Some nights I just need to see you
And cuddle in your arms, your arms.
I got a little bit of a lot,
But a little bit is not enough, not enough no
Sometimes I wish I was Jesus,
I'd get my Airmax on max on

I'm coming your way,
I don't care what I'd have to exchange for you,
If I knock on your door,
You won't have time to open it before I make love to you,
Yes it's all about quality, true,
But I need bigger quantity too,
Done with small doses,
Dipping my toes in,
I'm about to run run run across the ocean

Sometimes I wish I was Jesus
I'd get my Airmax on and run across the sea for you,
Some nights I just need to see you
And cuddle in your arms, your arms.
I got a little bit of a lot,
But a little bit is not enough, not enough no
Sometimes I wish I was Jesus,
I'd get my Airmax on max on

I'm hoping for, a miracle,
I really need to see my fella,
A little boat, with a telescope,
Or maybe I can get there if
I get my Airmax on max on
Tie my laces up tight, maximum,
I'm a get my Airmax on max on,
And run across the sea for you

Sometimes I wish I was Jesus
I'd get my Airmax on and run across the sea for you,
Some nights I just need to see you
And cuddle in your arms.

Sometimes I wish I was Jesus
I'd get my Airmax on and run across the sea for you,
Some nights I just need to see you
And cuddle in your arms, your arms.
I got a little bit of a lot,
But a little bit is not enough, not enough no
Sometimes I wish I was Jesus,
I'd get my Airmax on max on
I'd get my Airmax on
