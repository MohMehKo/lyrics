From California to London town,
I will hold it down,
I promise so baby please don't go
Cause if nobody hears that tree fall down,
Does it make a sound?
And am I even here if I'm alone

And there's nothing really I can do,
If you're gonna say it's over now,
I'm not used to taking it from you,
And bringing it back to me somehow

Cause I'm a lover not a fighter,
What's the point in life without it,
This world, we could run it, yeah we could run it

From California to London town,
I will hold it down,
I promise so baby please don't go
Cause if nobody hears that tree fall down,
Does it make a sound?
And am I even here if I'm alone

I know that you can tell that I'm afraid,
I'm not used to being on my own,
And I've got so much more to say,
But I don't wanna talk to myself though

I'm not a leaver I'm a stayer,
Yeah you know that I'm team player,
This world, we could take it, yeah we could take it

From California to London town,
I will hold it down,
I promise so baby please don't go
Cause if nobody hears that tree fall down,
Does it make a sound?
And am I even here if I'm alone

Lalalalalalalalala, lalalalalalalalalalala,
I'll lalala a hundred million songs,
But it's sweeter when you sing along
And we could run it

From California to London town,
I will hold it down,
I promise so baby please don't go
Cause if nobody hears that tree fall down,
Does it make a sound?
And am I even here if I'm alone
