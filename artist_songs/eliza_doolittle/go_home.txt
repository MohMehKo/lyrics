Peepin' out the door
I see those choppers are flying
Wonderin' what they're doin'
If they're lookin' for a girl with curly hair

Turnin' up the music
Just to block out the silence
Dance a little harder
Dance a little harder, dance a little harder
Maybe I'll try to escape

I just want to go home
(I just want to go home)
Unlock these handcuffs and let me go
(Let me go)

I don't know what I've done to you
(Done to you)
I'm not naughty, I tell the truth
(Tell the truth)

Scared of what I don't know
(Scared of what I don't know)
I just want to go

Slidin' up the rail
Up till the top of the staircase
Never gonna happen
Not the way we're actin', not in a million years

Something's already wrong
And everybody's a head case
So I'll just dance a little harder
Dance a little harder, dance a little harder
Tell them I can be good

I just want to go home
(I just want to go home)

Unlock these handcuffs and let me go
(Let me go)

I don't know what I've done to you
(Done to you)
I'm not naughty, I tell the truth
(Tell the truth)

Scared of what I don't know
(Scared of what I don't know)
I just want to go home

I just wanna go home
Put my dancing shoes
Put my dancing shoes on
I'll cha-cha-cha

I'll cha-cha-cha my way home
I won't stop a lot
Goin' through my phone

I just wanna go home
(I just wanna go home)
Unlock these handcuffs and let me go
(Let me go)

I don't know what I've done to you
(Done to you)
I'm not naughty, I tell the truth
(Tell the truth)

Scared of what I don't know
(Scared of what I don't know)
I just want to go home

Cha-cha-cha
