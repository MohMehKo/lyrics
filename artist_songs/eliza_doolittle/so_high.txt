Time is up
I need you to know, that I need you,
Don't you walk away,
I'm feeling so high
From my arms, from my lips to my eyes

In the alley-way feeling peaceful now,
Traffic doesn't ever bother me,

It's enough for me,
Living in my dreams,
I just can't be bothered,
Why should I be bothered?

My time is up
I need you to know, that I need you,
Don't you walk away,
I'm feeling so high
From my arms, from my lips to my eyes

On a sunny day, 
Sit and contemplate,
All the things that really matter now,
It hurts to hear that you're doing good,
I just can't be bothered,
Why should I be bothered?

I know the truth
Gotta let you go
Gotta put you out
You've become a foe

My time is up
I need you to know, that I need you,
Don't you walk away,
I'm feeling so high
From my arms, from my lips to my eyes

My time is up
I need you to know, that I need you,
Don't you walk away,
I'm feeling so high
From my arms, from my lips to my eyes
