Let’s spend Christmas in bed this year 
Let the red wine go to our heads this year 
It’s cold out there but don’t be scared 
'Cause I’ll be your baby there 
Yeah all I wanna do is hibernate with you 
'Cause no one else’s love compares 

[Chorus]
Lets spend this year under the covers 
What’s Christmas for if it’s not for each other 
Lets spend this year under the covers 
What’s Christmas for Christmas for 

The best gift that I could give is my love [x2]

Let’s spend Christmas alone this year 
Just you plus one plus some mistletoe this year 
'Cause I don’t need a Christmas tree if I got you kissin me 
Yeah, all I wanna do is hibernate with you 
There’s nowhere else I’d rather be 

[Chorus] 

Without my baby, baby 
What's Christmas for, Christmas for
Without my baby, baby

[Chorus]

The best gift that I could give is my love [x2]
