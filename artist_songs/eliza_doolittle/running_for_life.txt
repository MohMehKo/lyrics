Picking up both my feet
Rolled them in in front of me
Steady now
I'm allowed to take fault to learn my oath 
And I know I've been there before
I'm sure I put some more
Running for, running for life, running for life

Time runs a marathon
I need to carry on
like every days my last
This time runs extra fast
Won't let myself feel too guilty
leave all the stress behind
I'm running for my life

Please excuse the evening news
He covered up in a victim for quite some time
Either lies... always talk about applause
But she knows that he's had a prob
She'll pick herself right up 
Running for running for life running for life

Time runs a marathon
I need to carry on
like every days my last
This time runs extra fast
Won't let myself feel too guilty
leave all the stress behind
I'm running for my life

Time runs a marathon
I need to carry on
like every days my last
This time runs extra fast
Won't let myself feel too guilty
leave all the stress behind
I'm running for my life

Falling over
I could sprain my knee
But is it really over?
Is it over?
Falling over
I could bruise my soul 
But is it really over?
Is it over?

Time runs a marathon
I need to carry on
like every days my last
Cause time runs extra fast
Won't let myself feel too guilty
leave all the stress behind
I'm running for my life

Time runs a marathon
I need to carry on
like every days my last
Cause time runs extra fast
Won't let myself feel too guilty
leave all the stress behind
I'm running for my life
