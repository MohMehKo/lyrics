Banging on my tambourine,
I didn't think i'd make a scene
Until everyone joined in the chase,
I never meant to make you cry,
My head was floating in the sky,
And nothing looked to be out of place

I've got my head like a cello,
Melancholy bows,
If it goes, keep it mellow, baby,
Should I pay attention to the alarm,
The sirens going off in a police car

I forget, I forget to be cool, cool, cool
I try my best to not get arrested by you, you, you

I thought that I could plinky-plonk 
Along the piano wall I wanted,
Didn't think you'd hear a wrong note,
I'm like a pencil load and blunt,
And writing in a bolder font,
And I'm steady losing your boat

And I forget, I forget to be cool, cool, cool
I try my best to not get arrested by you, you, you

I've got my head like a cello,
Melancholy bows,
If it goes, keep it mellow, baby,
Should I pay attention to the alarm,
The sirens going off in a police car

And I forget, I forget to be cool, cool, cool
I try my best to not get arrested by you, you, you

I forget, I forget to be cool, cool, cool
I try my best to not get arrested by you, you, you
