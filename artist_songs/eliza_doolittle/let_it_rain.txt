I found my way with bad directions
I've done my best, and I learned my lessons
And I know I can do this, again and again 
So, let it rain, just let it rain, just let it rain on me
So, let it rain, just let it rain, just let it rain on me

Got a feeling of falling, like in a bad dream
What's the meaning, the calling, 'cause nothing is what it seems.
And I wont ever know, so I take the time, 'cause it wont stop taking mine

I don't know what a winner is, but I want to be one. 
Would I ever really know, if I didn't get me some?

'Cause I found my way with bad directions
I've done my best, and I learned my lessons
And I know I can do this, again and again 
So, let it rain, just let it rain, just let it rain on me

What the signs are saying, over and over 
If you fear it, you should face it
But my fear has the face of you.

I want to make, make you proud
Those the only words, that I care, care about

I don't know what a winner is, but I want to be one. 
Would I ever really know, if I didn't get me some?

'Cause I found my way with bad directions
I've done my best, & I learned my lessons
And I know I can do this, again and again 
So, let it rain, just let it rain, just let it rain on me
So, let it rain, just let it rain, just let it rain on me

I see your face in the crowd
All I want to do is make you proud
And they can say what they want
Those are the only words that I care about
If I can't fight, I still stand,
So you can see who I am 
Come gather 'round, quiet down, do you hear that sound?

Just let it rain on me.
Just let it rain on me.
Just let it rain on me.
Just let it rain on me.

I know I can do this, again and again 
So, let it rain, just let it rain, just let it rain on me
So, let it rain, just let it rain, just let it rain on me
So, let it rain, just let it rain, just let it rain on me
So, let it rain, just let it rain, just let it rain on me
