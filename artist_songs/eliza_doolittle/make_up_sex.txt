Drinking on champagne,
Straight from a shot glass,
We're on the rocks cause
You just can't make a good thing last.
I'm numb to your halo,
It's not got the same glow,
So rip up your queen of hearts,
Cause you played your last game of cards.

Get off my bed,
You can't fool me this time, I'm not scared,
If I lose you lose you lose you lose you,
Cause I see through through you through you

You're so good at walking out, so walk out,
We're so good at falling out, let's fall out,
Now there's barely nothing left,
So don't stick about for the make up sex,
I'm not playing any games, not now,
Cause I'm running out of change, I'm all out,
Think you know what's coming next,
But don't stick about for the make up sex

No don't you hold your breath,
For what you just won't get

Teenager divorce,
You take the x-box,
I'll keep the PS3,
But I won't let you have custody.
Of all my emotions,
Won't let them be broken,
I'll learn how to keep control,
You can keep my jewels,
If it means you'll go.

Get off my bed,
You can't fool me this time, I'm not scared,
If I lose you lose you lose you lose you,
Cause I see through through you through you

You're so good at walking out, so walk out,
We're so good at falling out, let's fall out,
Now there's barely nothing left,
So don't stick about for the make up sex,
I'm not playing any games, not now,
Cause I'm running out of change, I'm all out,
Think you know what's coming next,
But don't stick about for the make up sex

I'm gonna make my bed,
So don't you dare lay there,
All alone dippin' under this duvet,
But I won't fall for your voulez-vous coucher,
No don't you hold your breath,
For what you just won't get,
And it hurts me babe,
And it hurts me baby,
And it hurts me babe,
And it hurts me baby,
But I'll get over it

You're so good at walking out, so walk out,
We're so good at falling out, let's fall out,
Now there's barely nothing left,
So don't stick about for the make up sex,
I'm not playing any games, not now,
Cause I'm running out of change, I'm all out,
Think you know what's coming next,
But don't stick about for the make up sex
For the make up sex

Don't put your money on the make up sex
