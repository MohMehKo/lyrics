Alright, I'm gonna blow my cover and say you weren't favourite lover
But there was just one little problem, you were such a motherfucker
You didn't wanna believe in me
wanted to tell me who I should be and that was way too much for me

So give it up, give it up
And I remember your fingers running through my hair
So give it up, give it up
But I tell you nothing's gonna take me back there

[Chorus:]
I can tell you that I'm missing kissing, but I'm not missing you
I know you heard that I've been feeling, needing
But I'm not feeling you
Yeah, everybody needs some love
But I'mma get my fix from someone else's lips because
I'm missing kissing, but I'm not missing you, no

So, baby what do you reckon? You know I like the way you're sexing
You got the back of my neck and..
Wait, hold on for a second
Oh shit, you better be going home because I'm better off on my own
And if I didn't know then now I know

So give it up, give it up
It's my imagination dreaming of summer nights
So give it up, give it up
But it's not an invitation I think I'm gonna be alright

[Chorus:]
I can tell you that I'm missing kissing, but I'm not missing you
I know you heard that I've been feeling, needing but I'm not feeling you
Yeah, everybody needs some love but I'mma get my fix from someone else's lips
Because I'm missing kissing but I'm not missing you, no

So give it up, give it up
I thought I knew you but I didn't know myself
So give it up, give it up
And it's not use pretending the you're someone else

[Chorus:]
I can tell you that I'm missing kissing, but I'm not missing you
I know you heard that I've been feeling, needing but I'm not feeling you
Yeah, everybody needs some love. So I'mma get my fix from someone else's lips
Because I'm missing kissing but I'm not missing you, no
