[CHORUS]
Nowhere to be, Nowhere to go 
Living a life, through the window
Caught in a rush, taking it slow
On Euston road

Spending the time, stuck at the lights
Thinking of you, passenger side
At least we got the radio
Caught up in Euston road

[VERSE]
I guess I never set out to be sitting here in a jam
I guess you never set out to be sitting here where I am
Could be tooting on your horn in a mini or a 4x4
We're bumper to bumper babe
And nobody's getting away

[CHORUS]

[VERSE]
I got my hand on the wheel and the other one in your hair
I gotta be somewhere but I wont forget your there
Something bad happens and it crawls up and hits us hard
I find that your all that matters babe
When life just wont behave

[BRIDGE]
You don't be down 
Cos' its just how were getting around
Don't think of your goal
It's the journey that counts don't you know

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE]
Looking up and seeing how were getting older
Makes my eyes flicker down till it's over
I don't wanna' look ahead to the future
But I can see Kings Cross getting closer

Looking up and seeing how were getting older
Makes my eyes flicker down till it's over
I don't wanna' look ahead to the future
But I can see Kings Cross

[CHORUS]
