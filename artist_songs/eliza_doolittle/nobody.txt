I could be A, I could be C
Multiple choice I don't want to be
All the above don't fit in with me
Not with me

'Cause nobody cares and nobody loves
That somebody does what nobody does
And everyone follows them just because
Of the bus

I'm gonna be what I want
Instead of being what I'm not
Maybe it's not enough
Then I want none of it

What's wrong with bein' a nobody?
That nobody knows and has nobodies
And I should know 'cause I am one of these
Happy to blend and I really am honestly

The whole world's tryin' to be somebody
Kickin' themselves 'bout what could've been
What's wrong with bein' a nobody?
I'm not pretendin' I am what I'll never be

I walk in a lake, walk up the wall
I'm no Messiah, I'm nothin' at all
Compared to the greatest people I see
I'm just me

Am I makin' a change, I don't have a clue
Maybe I can't 'cause I love what I do
Isn't a sign just fittin' somewhere else?
To a tune

I'm gonna be what I want
Instead of being what I'm not
Maybe it's not enough
Then I want none of it

What's wrong with bein' a nobody?
That nobody knows and has nobodies
And I should know 'cause I am one of these
Happy to blend and I really am honestly

The whole world is tryin' to be somebody
Kickin' themselves 'bout what could've been
What's wrong with bein' a nobody?
I'm not pretendin' I am what I'll never be

I'm gonna be what I want
I'm just playin' a part
And what my character does
Is not important, it just is
What it is, is what it is

Tu-tu, tu-tu-tu
Tu-tu-tu
Tu-tu-tu
Tu-tu-tu

What's wrong with bein' a nobody?
That nobody knows and has nobodies
And I should know 'cause I am one of these
Happy to blend and I really am honestly

The whole world is tryin' to be somebody
(What kind of nobody are you?)
Kickin' themselves 'bout what could've been
(What kind of nobody are you?)

What's wrong with bein' a nobody?
(What kind of nobody are you?)
I'm not pretendin' I am what I'll never be

What's wrong with bein' a nobody?
(What kind of nobody are you?)
That nobody knows and has nobodies
(What kind of nobody are you?)

And I should know 'cause I am one of these
(What kind of nobody are you?)
Happy to blend and I really am
