What a waste of time
Precious little time
But I'll waste some of yours babe
If you waste some of mine

What a waste of time
Precious little time
But I'll waste some of yours babe
If you waste some of mine

There's a moment that feels like a-nothing
Until it's passed away
There's a glow and it won't last forever
Think about it every day

I don't know what you see in me
I don't know why you stay
Cause you don't owe me nothing
But you give it to me anyway

What a waste of time
Precious little time
But I'll waste some of yours babe
If you waste some of mine

What a waste of time
Precious little time
But I'll waste some of yours babe
If you waste some of mine

So you think that it's not really working
Well darling look again
It's imperfect and that's why it's perfect
Other colours are so plain

You don't always see the best in me
And I don't know what to say
Cause you don't owe me nothing
But you give it to me anyway

What a waste of time
Precious little time
But I'll waste some of yours babe
If you waste some of mine

What a waste of time
Precious little time
But I'll waste some of yours babe
If you waste some of mine

Cause I know what I got and it's setting me free
Anything that you want then I'm happy to be
Cause if I don't have your face then there's nothing to see

So baby please don't leave me
Baby please don't leave me
Baby never never never never leave me

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

What a waste of time
Precious little time
But I'll waste some of yours babe
If you waste some of mine

What a waste of time
Precious little time
But I'll waste some of yours babe
If you waste some of mine
