When I'm with you,
How time flies,
It's gonna be a short but amazing life,
I'm proud to know you,
Feels so right,
You're my go to,
Even when it's you I fight

Cause I'm in love with you,
There's nothing I can do,
I'm in love through the good and the bad,
I'm in love with you,
And I am trusting you,
With my beating heart held in your hands

Cause I'm in love with you,
There's nothing I can do,
I'm in love through the good and the bad,
I'm in love with you,
And I am trusting you,
With my beating heart held in your hands

You've got the power to destroy my world,
So just kiss me and tell me I'm your only girl,
You could hurt me and take all that I have to give,
But even still you're that person I could never be angry with

Cause I'm in love with you,
There's nothing I can do,
I'm in love through the good and the bad,
I'm in love with you,
And I am trusting you,
With my beating heart held in your hands

Cause I'm in love with you,
There's nothing I can do,
I'm in love through the good and the bad,
I'm in love with you,
And I am trusting you,
With my beating heart held in your hands

Held in your hands

I'm in love with you,
There's nothing I can do,
I'm in love through the good and the bad,
I'm in love with you,
And I am trusting you,
With my beating heart held in your hands

Cause I'm in love with you,
There's nothing I can do,
I'm in love through the good and the bad,
I'm in love with you,
And I am trusting you,
With my beating heart held in your hands

I'm in love with you,
And I am trusting you,
With my beating heart held in your hands
