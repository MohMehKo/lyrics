[Chorus:]
There's one in a bed, too much space to move around
Please come back and get in my way again
I take back what I said, you're perfect just the way you are
So, please come back and get in my way again

I'm so tired, of keeping my headphones on
Marvin Gaye and Chinese takeaways
As much as I love them they will never fill the space

I remember, when you drive me round the bend
Blocking up my door way, now there's nothing I want more

[Chorus:]
There's one in a bed, too much space to move around
Please come back and get in my way again
I take back what I said, you're perfect just the way you are
So, please come back and get in my way again

I'm starving, I miss how you filled our fridge
With Lucozade and all the crap you made
I guess we were unhealthy in so many ways

I remember when you drive me round the bend
Blocking up my door way, now there's nothing I want more

[Chorus:]
There's one in a bed, too much space to move around
Please come back and get in my way again
I take back what I said, you're perfect just the way you are
So, please come back and get in my way again

There's one in a bed, too much space to move around
Please come back and get in my way again
I take back what I said, you're perfect just the way you are
I miss the way you tried to be Bonnie and Clyde

How can we be Bonnie and Clyde, when I can't get Clyde by my side?
How can we ever be those two, when I'm cuddling a pillow instead of you

[Chorus:]
There's one in a bed, too much space to move around
Please come back and get in my way again
I take back what I said, you're perfect just the way you are
So, please come back and get in my way again

I'll wrap my leg around you, this time you're not going anywhere
