Long ago a little child
Dreamed about a gallant knight.
It's funny how the dream comes true.
That gallant knight was you.
I never try to show my feelings
Are you aware my heart is bleeding?
What are we waiting for?
What are we doin' here?
There's no one there beside you.
There's no one knocking at my door.
What are we waiting for?
Too much time has passed us by.
What are we waiting for?
No one else can love you more...than me
I've watched you for so many years.
I've heard you laugh
I've felt your tears.
I've seen your lovers come and go
But none of them were true.
Oh, can't you see..how much I need you?
Won't you believe I need you too?
So..
What are we waiting for?
What are we doin' here?
There's no one there beside you.
There's no one knocking at my door.
What are we waiting for?
Too much time has passed us by.
What are we waiting for?
No one else could love you more...than me.
Yours was the first star I followed.
Without you there's no tomorrow.
What are we waiting for?
What are we doin' here?
There's no one there beside you.
There's no one knocking at my door.
At my door..
What are we waiting for?
Too much time has passed us by.
What are we waiting for?
No one else could love you more.....than me
