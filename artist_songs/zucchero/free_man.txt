So your walking
On the fence now
Would you believe though
It's cool by me
Don't think that love
Should ever hold you down
I want you here
If you want to be around
So I let you have
Your freedom
Then I'll take it
As it comes down
It's part of love baby
Lovin' you
I've gotta let you
Be a freeman
Tell me if you
Wanna break out
I've gotta let you
Be a free loving man
Tell me if you
Wanna break out
If you pack your bags
And move on
(you can) pick up
the pieces and
start again
cause I've learned
the hard way
I know this is true
Dedication
You can persue
So I'll let you
Have your freedom
Then I'll take it
As it as comes down
It's a part of love baby
Lovin' you
I've gotta let you
Be a freeman
Tell me if you
Wanna break out
Oh he's a freeman,
A free man
A free man
A free man
