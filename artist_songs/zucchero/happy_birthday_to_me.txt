Happy Birthday to me
Years go by so easily
Happy Birthday to me now
I remember white sweet cake
Party hats, pinatas and balloons
Birthday shoes and my innocense
Laughter and those long gone afternoons
I look in the mirror when I get up
And those devilish eyes light up
Oh man,
When will I
Ever grow up?
Alright!
Happy Birthday to me
Years go by so easily
Happy Birthday to me now
A few pounds here, few pounds there
Maybe a big wedding to prepare
Some dilemmas but mostly bliss
First gray hair for sanity dismissed
I'm supposed to have some commone sense
With the time and experience
Oh man
Like in school
The same old fool
Happy Birthday to me
Years go by so easily
Happy Birthday to me, now
Talkin' 'bout my special day
(talking 'bout that special day)
Talkin' 'bout that special special day
c'mon
Happy Birthday (Happy Birthday)
Happy Birthday yeah (Happy Birthday yeah)
I look in the mirror when I get up
It's the same old questions start
Oh man,
When will you
Ever grow up?
Celebrate it with me
C'mon c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Wait a minute! Get a moment, Time out!
yeah, alright
Happy Birthday to me now
Happy Birthday to me now
