Every man has got two cities he needs to be
The one he can touch and the one he can’t see
The one where’s a strangers a friend

Everyman has got one city of Liberty
For me it’s Paris… I love it
Every time I try to lose myself
I seem to find these streets of surrender

You’re free baby baby
You’re free now and forever
It’s Christmas time you can decide
To forget or to remember
You’re free baby baby
I didn’t come down here to fight you
I came here down these streets
Of love and pride to surrender
The streets of surrender
Of surrender

I heard the oldest story that nobody seems to know
I think it was about that stranger
It was youth and love and it was danger

It was winter but that warm it gets before the snow
It froze my soul
I’m crying, crying ‘bout some kid that they found
Lying on a beach… born in a manger

You’re free baby baby,
Free now and forever
It’s Christmas time you can decide
To forget or to remember
You’re free baby baby
I didn’t come down here to fight you
I came here down these streets
Of love and pride to surrender
The streets of surrender
To surrender

I live in the stories that are told
In the child you chose to hold
And the ones you turn away

To be free baby baby
Free now and forever
This vale of tears will disappear
And it’s love you will remember
You’re free baby baby
I didn’t come down here to fight you
I came here down these streets
Of love and pride to surrender
The streets of surrender
The streets of surrender
