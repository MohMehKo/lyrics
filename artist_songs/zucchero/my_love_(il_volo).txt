Stray cat in a mad dog city
9 ways to sorrow
a moment's all it takes to say goodbye
I'm waiting
Wild cat in a sad dog story
9 roads to follow
a moment's all it takes to say goodbye
for all the love that's torn us... for us
for all the pain so sweet
say you won't say you won't leave
My love, I'm dreaming of one girl
someone to make my world
someone just like you
My love, the girl that I'm dreamin'
to give me that feeling
someone just like you
Stray cat in a mad dog city
9 lives to borrow
a moment's all it takes to say goodbye
I'm waiting
Lost cat in a dead end story
9 lines that echo
a moment's all it takes to say goodbye
for all the love before us... for us
for all the pain so sweet
say you won't, say you won't leave
My love, I'm dreaming of one girl
someone to make my world
someone just like you
My love, the girl that I'm dreamin'
to give me that feeling
someone just like you
Siamo caduti in volo, mio sole
siamo caduti in volo, mio cielo
siamo caduti in volo
Baby don't cry, baby don't cry
Baby don't cry, baby don't cry
Gonna paint this town, for you
turn it upside down
say you won't say won't leave
Sogno, qualcosa di buono
che mi illumini il mondo
buono come te...
Che ho bisogno, di qualcosa di vero
che illumini il cielo
proprio come te!!!
Che ho bisogno, di qualcosa di buono
che mi illumini il mondo
proprio come te
