There was a time, I was alone
My road was long, my courage low
Someone to love, someone to love me
Is that too much? I want to know....

Anytime as time will be passing, for us all
It's time to be free...to be free
Anytime, now is the future....
And This is the day

In other words, I'm born to loose now
I want to win, once before I go
Been abused, not the abuser
Is that too much? I want to know
(that's right!)

Anytime as time will be passing, for us all
It's time to be free...to be free
Anytime, now is the future
This is the day

Oh time, time
What will you do with your time?
Time, time.....
All that you own is your time
Time - Don't have to travel alone

It's time to be free,
To be free

Anytime
What will you do with your time?

It's time to be free, to be free!
Now!

Anytime, time,
What will you do with your time?

It's time to be free
To be free

And this is the day....
Anytime
This is the day
Anytime
This is the day
Oh time.....
Oh time.....
Anytime...
