Stray cats in a mad dog city
9 ways to sorrow
A moment's all it takes to say goodbye
I'm waiting
Wild cats in a sad dog story
9 roads to follow
A moment's all it takes to say goodbye
For all the days before us - for love
For all the pain you've got
Say you won't - say you won't give up
Love comes - and gives you that feeling
You're suddenly dreaming
Of a brand new day
Cause when love comes - the world has new meaning
And everything's gleaming
Like the downtown lights
Stray cats in a mad dog city
9 lives to borrow
A moment's all it takes to say goodbye
I'm waiting
Lost cats in a dead end story
9 lines that echo
A moment's all it takes to say goodbye
For all the days before us - for love
For all the pain you've got
Say you won't - say you won't give up
Love comes - and gives you that feeling
You're suddenly dreaming
Of a brand new day
Cause when love comes - the world has new meaning
And everything's gleaming
Like the downtown lights
Siamo caduti in volo, mio cielo
Siamo caduti in volo
Baby don't cry, baby don't cry
Baby don't cry, baby don't cry, baby don't cry
They're gonna paint this town - for us
Turn it upside down
Say you won't - say you won't give up
Sogno, qualcosa di buono
Che mi illumini il mondo
Buono come te...
Cause when love comes - the world has new meaning
And everything's gleaming
Like the downtown lights
Cause when love comes - the world has new meaning
You're suddenly dreaming
Of a brand new day
