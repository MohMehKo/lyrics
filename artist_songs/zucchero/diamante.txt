Where do I go, when part of me is dying?
Someone that i can be share
Those space in my life.

I'll be the rain, and you'll be heaven crying
My eyes will be filled with flowers
Upon the snowfields of white.

And we will learn to walk together
Oh hand in hand, we'll walk together
Domenica.

Waiting for you, I'll drink a glass of wine
I pray that my beating heart
Will lead you into my life

Time in the distance, will bring me to your side
From high up in heaven, diamante
We'll see peace with our eyes.

We'll see them walking, the brides and soldiers
Dance in the dark, they melt together
Against the twilight
And all together we'll lift our voices
Singing the time, to play at soldiers
Is gone forever
Domenica.

Fai piano i bimbi grandi non piangono
Fai piano i bimbi grandi non piangono
Fai piano i bimbi grandi non piangono

We'll see them walking, the brides and soldiers
Dance in the dark, they melt together
Against the twilight
And all together we'll lift our voices
Singing the time, to play at soldiers
Is gone forever
Domenica.

Delmo, Delmo vin a' c√†...
