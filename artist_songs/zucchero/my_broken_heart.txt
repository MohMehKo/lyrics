Took a message
From my heart to you
Want to tell
What we're going through
Disillusioned
And troubled inside
Is this all that left
When love has died
The air is heavy
As the winds of change
Blows through my life
And I must rearrange
All the colours of a world
Sublime
From the darkness
Of this heart of mine
My broken heart
Has nothing more to lose
A world a part,
We make this sad song true
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, woh, oh, woh oh
Just took a message
From my heart to you
Wanna tell you
What we're going through
Disillusioned
And troubled inside
Is this all that left
When love has died
I often wonder
If you feel the same
I've got to find a way
To ease the pain
Find the colours of a world
Sublime
From the darkness
Of this heart of mine
Now's the time to take control
Of my life, my heart
My soul wants to see
The light
I'll fly away on wings of gold
My soul wants to see
The light
My broken heart
Has nothing more to lose
A world a part,
We make this sad song true
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, woh, oh, woh oh
Just took a message
From my heart to you
Wanna tell you
What we're going through
Disillusioned
And troubled inside
Is this all that left
When love has died
Such desperation
I've never know
All these lonely nights
That I spend on my own
Until the day
I leave behind
The darkness
Of this heart of mine
My broken heart,
Well my broken heart's
Got nothing left to lose
... my broken heart
