I can't stop
the way I feel
Things you do
don't seem real
Tell you what I got in mind
'cause we're runnin' out of time
Won't you ever set me free?
This waitin' 'rounds killin' me
She drives me crazy
like no one else
She drives me crazy
and I can't help myself
I can't get
any rest
People say
I'm obsessed
Everything that's serious lasts
But to me there's no surprise
What I have, I knew was true
Things go wrong, they always do
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
I won't make it,
On my own
No on likes,
To be alone
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
Uh huh huh
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
Uh huh huh
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
