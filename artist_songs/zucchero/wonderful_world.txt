I tell ya brother, man shit happens
By the way, howzit with you?
Check out the kid, finger on the button
Oh yeah it's a wonderful world, huh

Got no desire, uh, to desire
Hey jack, ain't that a trip
And you madam, standing there for hire
Oh yeah, where's your wonderfil world?

I'll be leaving in the morning
Far away from you
Yes I'm taking that step
I'm gonna jump in the blue

Falling, ending my depression
It's calling, oh my obsession.

There might be days, when I think it's better
Hey babe, like you want me to be
Pull the chain, down goes the water
Oh yeah, it's a wonderful world

I'll be leaving in the morning
Nothing left to do
Yes I'm taking that step
I'm gonna jump in the blue

Falling, ending my depression
It's calling, oh my obsession.

I'll be gone with the morning sun
Far away from you
Yes I'm taking that step
I'm gonna jump in the blue
A giant step in the blue.

Oh I'm leaving in the morning
Nothing left to do
Yes I'm taking that step
I'm gonna jump in the blue

Falling, ending my depression
It's coming, I can feel the vibration
Falling, ending my depression

It's calling, give me wings
Give me my liberation
I been lonely lord
A final jump in the blue
Oh no, oh, no a giant step in the blue
Oh no oh no a final jump in the blue
