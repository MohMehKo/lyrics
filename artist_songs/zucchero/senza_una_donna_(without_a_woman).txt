This ain't the way, I spend my mornings baby
Come stai?
You been with him, and now you come back lady
Hey, what's he like?

I just sit, and watch the ocean
With myself, even doing my own cookin'
You can laugh, you're forgiven, but
I'm no longer frightened, to be livin'

Senza una donna, no more pain and no sorrow
Without a woman, I'll make it through tomorrow
Senza una donna, givin' me torture and bliss
Without a woman, better like this

There is no way, that you can buy me baby
Don't make fun
You got to dig a little deeper lady (in the heart?)
Yeah, if you have one

Here's my heart, feel the power
Look at me, I'm a flower
You can laugh, you're forgiven, but
I'm no longer frightened to be livin'

Senza una donna, no more pain and no sorrow
Without a woman, I'll make it through tomorrow
Senza una donna, givin' me torture and bliss

Ooh I stay here, and watch the ocean
Don't know why, I keep on talkin'
You may laugh, you're forgiven, but
I'm no longer frightened (maybe), to be livin'

Senza una donna, no more pain and no sorrow
Without a woman, I'll make it through tomorrow
Senza una donna, givin' me torture and bliss
Without a woman, vieni qui! come on in
Senza una donna, I don't know what might follow
Senza una donna, oh, maybe from tomorrow!
Senza una donna, givin' me torture and bliss
