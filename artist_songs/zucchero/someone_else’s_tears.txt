You feel familiar
But I’m not sure I know your name
I don’t know why I’m telling you this story today
A whisper on the breeze
I heard a rustle in the trees
I need to know and maybe you’ll explain

Why I can’t stop crying
And nothing is as it appears
I can’t stop crying
But I’m crying someone else’s tears
Someone else’s tears
The grapes are gathered
The wine is pressed
And despite the rain it’s been a good year
To walk these fields again
In the chapel of our youth we bowed down to beauty and truth
I see no reason but maybe you’ll explain

Why I can’t stop crying
But I’m crying someone else’s tears
Someone else’s tears

The red house that we built…
It’s still standing… proud
The glasses that we filled…
Let’s raise them now
It might be raining
But the sun is gonna burst through the clouds
The storm it can be stilled…
Let’s go out…

But I can’t stop crying
As I’m crashing through the gears
I can’t stop crying
But I’m crying someone else’s tears
Someone else’s tears

I can’t stop lying
Have I been lying all these years?
I can’t stop trying
To chase away her fears
I can’t stop crying, crying,
Someone else’s tears
