In the vastness of this world,
baby you are so unique.
In the sadness of this life,
you bring happiness to me.

From your head down to your toes,
you are beautiful, divine.
There never is a moment that you,
are not on my mind.

Circumstances cast our fate,
maybe wrong, maybe right.
Though your dreams are miles away,
(I) try to reach you through this night.

From your head down to your toes,
you are beautiful, divine.
There never is a moment that you,
are not on my mind.
Take it.

[Instrumental]

'Cos there never is a moment that you,
there never is a moment that you,
there never is a moment that you,
are not on my mind (my mind, my mind).
