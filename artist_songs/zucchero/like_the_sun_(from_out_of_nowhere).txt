In this world - I am gonna walk
Until my feet - refuse to take me any longer
Yes i' m gonna walk - and walk some more

And I will ask - everyone I meet
Ask till they tell me - ther's no answers anymore
Yes i'm gonna ask - more and some more

And I will love somebody somewhere
Till my heart breaks - until it's done
Until it explodes - from out of nowhere
Like the sun - like the sun

In this world - I am gonna sing
Until my voice - won't be singing any longer
Yes i'm gonna sing - more and some more

And I will love somebody somewhere
Till my heart breaks - until it's done
Until it explodes - from out of nowhere
Like the sun - like the sun

I will be looking - at everyone
Until my eyes - refuse to see them any longer
And though it hurts me so - gonna keep on looking
Looking looking at me

And I will love somebody somewhere
Till my heart breaks - until it's done
Until it explodes - from out of nowhere
Like the sun - like the sun

In this world - I will love no more
So love can't hurt me - hurt me any longer
