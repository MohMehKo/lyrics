Take me in your arms
And let me go
Tell me what the dreams
Inside me know
In my secret heart
Where the places
Are torn apart
Love quiet
Love strong
Love's over
A love so long
Love asked me
But love knows
Love follows
Where love goes
Give me all the words
I want to say
Tell me when your tears
Will run away
To my secret heart
Where the places
Are torn apart
Love quiet
Love strong
Love's over
A love so long
Love asked me
But love knows
Love follows
Where love goes
It's gone for me
Don't know
Where my love could be
Don't know
Why you can't believe me
