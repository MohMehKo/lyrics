Take my soul and my sorrow
I've been losing my mind
Take my soul in my sorrow
Walking on, dunes of mercy
Don't cry, oh no
Joy, will dry your tears
And misery
Make it disappear, oooh...

Take my soul and my sorrow
Like a babe at your breast now
Take my soul and my forrow
Rolling on, dunes of mercy

Don't cry, oh no
Joy, you're not alone
Oh shelter me
Lord please take me home...oooh....

Babe, let the feeling go
Unchain my emotion
Stay 'cause I need you so, ooh
Oh never, never leave me
So let the river flow
On down to your ocean
And let the rain fall
Over me

Take my soul in my sorrow
I've been losing my mind
No yesterday, no tomorrow
Walking on, dunes of mercy

Don't cry, oh no
Joy, will dry your tears
And misery
Make it disappear....oooh

Take my soul in my sorrow
Walking on, dunes of mercy
Take my soul and my sorrow
Walking on, walking on
Dunes of mercy
Take my soul in my sorrow
