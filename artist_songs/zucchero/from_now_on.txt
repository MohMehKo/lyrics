When I said that I just wanted to make love to you
I realize baby, I was wrong
What I meant to say is that I wanna spend my life with you
I wanna love you baby from now on
From now on
'Till everything is gone
From now on
Just you and me alone
From now on
'Till God calls us home
I wanna love you baby from now on
Yeah
Through the courtship and the marriage
And all the kids you carried
And baby, even after they are grown
My love will never waver
It will always be your favor
Cause I wanna love you, baby
From now on
From now on
'Till everything is gone
From now on
Just you and me alone
From now on
'Till God calls us home
I wanna love you, baby
From now on
(Take it)
From now on
From now on 'till everything is gone
From now on
Just you and me alone
From now on
'Till God calls us home
I wanna love you baby
From now on
From now on
'Till everything is gone
From now on
Just you and me alone
From now on
Till God calls us home
I wanna love you baby,
From now on
I want to love you baby, from now on
I wanna love you baby, from now on
I want to love you baby, from now on
Yeah, ohh, yeah
