Something strong I feel it taking old of me
Something strong just can't imagine what it could be

Some of the time I'm living in a desert dream
Something strong I'm bathing in a moolight bean
Tell me why I stay when I should break away
Something here just ain't right
But I ain't got the strenght to fight
Something strong I feel it coming over me
Something strong just can't imagine what it could be oh!
I'm trying it's getting heavy on my back
Something strong don't know exactly where I'm at
Tell me why I stay when I should break away
Something's coming over me
Oh! I'm trying
Something strong don't know exactly where I'm at
Tell me why I stay when I should break away
Something here just ain't right
Something's coming over me......
Something strong..............
