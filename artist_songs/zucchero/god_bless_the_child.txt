Looking for someone
God bless the child
Where's he gone and run to?
Where'd he hide?
Maybe there's no words
No words that I know
Soul is like an ocean
But the flesh grows cold
I see a shadow in the mirror
I feel the spirit in my bones
I feel joy will drown the sorrow
Like a child that can never grow old
Looking for someone
God bless the child
What you gonna cling to
In the cold daylight
I see a shadow in the mirror
I feel the spirit in my bones
Oh… feel life and joy will drown the sorrow
Let him dream, let him sing, let him go
Looking for someone
God bless the child
I remember Mamas loving oh… with a smile
I remember Mamas loving with a smile
