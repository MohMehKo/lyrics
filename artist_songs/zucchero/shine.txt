Just me and four walls
It's cold outside
Nothing to eat
I got small talk and cigarettes
Inside my head - inside my head
I need you now
Everything I want
You know it means
Nothing to me
And I'm all out of cigarettes
The sky is red - inside my head
I need you now
Talking to me

Let it shine shine shine (shine on me)
Let it shine

Seen fields of winter wheat
In rolling waves
Move like the sea
And free birds dive to the ground
They disappear - I don't know where
Love only knows
And everything glows

Let it shine shine shine (shine on me)
Let it shine

You got to believe - how can you be so cold
Make me believe - you got no faith - shine on me
You got no faith

Let it shine shine shine (shine on me)
Let it shine

Ho visto il Missisipi
Come un mare
Amdare all'inferno
E un angelo
Tuffarsi
X non tornare, x non tornare
L'amore sa...
