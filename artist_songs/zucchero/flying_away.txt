Stand
You've got to make a stand
Take your cards and then you play your hand
Fate may call
Tears may fall
Through it all
You'll do your best to stand
Until you understand
And the sorrow falls away so far below you

Flying away - come sei bella
Flying away - tu scendi da una stella
Flying away - cosi' talmente bella
Flying away

Stand
And face the future square
Bless the past and walk away from there
'cause that was him
And this is you
And every day you're someone new

So stand
And you will understand
Leave the sorrow and dark memories behind you

Flying away - come sei bella
Flying away - tu scendi da una stella
Flying away - cosi' talmente bella
Flying away

Everyone wishes they could go back
Everyone wishes but no one can
So you keep the good and sweep the rest behind you

Flying away - come sei bella
Flying away - tu scendi da una stella
Flying away - cosi' talmente bella
Flying away
Fly away
Fly away
Fly away
Fly
Fly
Fly
