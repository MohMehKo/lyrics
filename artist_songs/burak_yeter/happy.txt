I feel the rain
Against my window
So far away
From all that I know

Memories flood in
Of those I miss the most
It feels good to be back

I'm happy, happy, happy to be home again
So happy, happy, happy to be home
Home again

I feel the rain
Against my window
So far away
From all that I know

Memories flood in
Of those I miss the most
It feels good to be back

I'm happy, happy, happy to be home again
So happy, happy, happy to be home
Home again

Happy to be home again

I'm happy, happy, happy to be home again
So happy, happy, happy to be home
Home again

Happy to be home
