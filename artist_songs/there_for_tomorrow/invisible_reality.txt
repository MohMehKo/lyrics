It's all around us, it's near
Living in my own mind of fear
These absent minded thoughts
Take my breath from my reach
Mankind has lost his it's prideful claims
It's gained a rightful life of shame
These memories drained dry
To escape the horror's open eyes

Eyes, eyes, eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyes

For those who catch a glimpse of grace,
That's where I want my resting place,
Our minds breaks as we say,
To live our lives each day
Is blocking what we see,
When we let go we can't just be
Our normal selves again,
To fear the horror's open eyes

Eyes, eyes, eyes
Open your eyes

Self destruction is the human race,
Brought up by fear's tight embrace

Self destruction is the human race,
Brought up by fear's tight embrace

Open your eyes

Self destruction is the human race,
Brought up by fear's tight embrace

Open your eyes
Open your eyes!
