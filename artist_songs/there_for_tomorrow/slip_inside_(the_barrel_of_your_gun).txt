slide on down
identify with every single sound that cuts you at the core
turn around, facing backwards
just to hold off everything you have in store

cause the road froze over on my way back home
it's a long October down here in the catacombs

slip inside, slip inside
ride the downward slope
slip inside, slip inside
how far will you go?
Open fire, open fire
on everything you know
cause I've been sleeping
in the barrel of your gun

here I lie
let your head fall on the curbside
and we can dodge cars all night
cause I can only hope you stand corrected
when the time comes to make leaps and bounds
right out of this town

slip inside, slip inside
ride the downward slope
slip inside, slip inside
how far will you go?
Open fire, open fire
on everything you know
cause I've been sleeping
in the barrel of your gun

now I'm one step closer to the end, I know
and I'm sliding down, so here I go
cause the road froze over on my way back home
it's a long October down here in the catacombs

slip inside, slip inside
ride the downward slope
slip inside, slip inside
how far will you go?
Open fire, open fire
on everything you know
cause I've been sleeping
I've been sleeping
in the barrel of your gun
