I listen for it
Your scarlet voice to pull me in
I feel for it
The face that reminds me where I am
Please pull me in
To loose your smile over time
Avoid my madness
And scar my life with ignorance
With ignorance, with ignorance

These words I give you
Are quick to heal the wounds
I drown my thoughts with yours
In his words

Pretend it's easy
To turn your head the other way
I value your time
Apparently I'm doing fine
But I won't try it
Regret that I did anything
At your convenience
Just scar my life with ignorance
With ignorance, with ignorance

These words I give you
Are quick to heal the wounds
I drown my thoughts with yours
In his words

These words I give you
Are quick to heal the wounds
I drown my thoughts with yours
In his words
