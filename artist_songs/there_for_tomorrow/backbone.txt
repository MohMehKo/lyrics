Your game 
Your lovely game
Is like pain and suffering
Your fame 
Your newly found fame
Is like repeating history

You now that keeping me around 
Makes me just quiver at the sounds
Wish I could feed their open mouths
With something worth it

Where is your backbone
Cause you're looking very flimsy
I'm breaking down your paper wall
Where is your backbone
If you hear it sing it with me
Everybody take the fall
You look so sound asleep 
I can't believe
That your backbone's missing
And you never had a clue at all

Believe 
No I can't believe 
How little all this means to me
You'll see 
You'll just have to see
For yourself the playback is deafening

Keeping me around 
Makes me just quiver at the sounds
Wish I could feed their open mouths
With something worth it

Where is your backbone
Cause you're looking very flimsy
I'm breaking down your paper wall
Where is your backbone
If you hear it sing it with me
Everybody take the fall
You look so sound asleep
I can't believe 
That your backbone's missing
And you never had a clue at all
You never had a clue at all

You could've been something
You could've been something memorable
I should've said something
I should've said

Where is your backbone
Cause you're looking very flimsy
I'm breaking down your paper wall
Where is your backbone
If you hear it sing it with me
Everybody take the fall
You look so sound asleep
I can't believe 
That your backbone's missing
And you never had a clue at all
You look so sound asleep
I can't believe 
That your backbone's missing 
And you never had a clue at all
