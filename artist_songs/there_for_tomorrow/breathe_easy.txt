Ticking like a timebomb, feeling unable
Close your eyes, grip tight and brace
Shield your ears, anticipate
Racing like a bloodrush off your body
There's no time for time to take
Only time to waste (So they say)
You feel the pressure, feel the pressure
Then you break
You feel the pressure, feel the pressure
Then you fade

So I feel a new air, go on and exhale
Just breathe easy, just breathe easy
I feel a new air, go on and exhale
Just breathe easy, breathe easy

You've got your ammunition out on the table
Taking shots and pointing blame
I see through the cracks, the cracks of your broken window pane
You feel the pressure, feel the pressure
Then you break
You feel the pressure, feel the pressure
Then you fade

So I feel a new air, go on and exhale
Just breathe easy, just breathe easy
I feel a new air, go on and exhale
Just breathe easy, breathe easy
Yeah
Just breathe easy, just breathe easy

You feel the pressure, feel the pressure
Then you'll fade
You feel the pressure, feel the pressure
Then you'll fade

Ooh, I feel a new air, go on and exhale
Just breathe easy, just breathe easy
I feel a new air, go on and exhale
Just breathe easy, breathe easy
