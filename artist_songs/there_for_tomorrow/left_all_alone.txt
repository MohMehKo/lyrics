I watched you walk away from life
helplessly gripping my own
I lie awake in my strife
the lights you walked was shown

the feelings that you're still with me now
you're watching me from the clouds

I saw you break your innocence
but you left me on my own
you left me alone
you left me alone

I watched you walk away from life
my eyes wait for yours
to feel your presence alive
my smiles now are forced

the feelings that you're still with me now
my soul is lost and found

I saw you break your innocence
but you left me on my own
you left me alone
you left me alone

my heart has been ripped away
but I had one thing to say

I saw you break your innocence
but you left me on my own
you left me alone

I saw you break your innocence
but you left me on my own
you left me alone
you left me alone
