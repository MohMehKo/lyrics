I'd hate to break it to you now
But that reoccurring sound
In your ear makes it perfect
Was it clear, my whole purpose?
I'm just fine with or without
Having this inner selfish doubt

I'll fall hard
You'll fall harder
I'm along
You're so startled

Break a sweat, desperate lover
Do you feel all alone?

I fell asleep on your deathbed
In a hole where your head rests
I'm facing truth so unfamiliar
I just close my eyes and
Fall asleep on your deathbed
Can we be resurrected?
I'm facing truth so unfamiliar
I'm your saint, will you be my savior?

I always hoped to bring this down
Words exchanging all around
You spoke quick, I spoke faster
Take you pick, take mine after
But the time went ticking
And hearts went missing
It's not what I waited on

Break a sweat, desperate lover
Do you feel all alone?

I fell asleep on your deathbed
In a hole where your head rests
I'm facing truth so unfamiliar
I just close my eyes and
Fall asleep on your deathbed
Can we be resurrected?
I'm facing truth so unfamiliar
I'm your saint, will you be my savior?

We both agreed that this was best
But I can't risk to lose my rest
I closed my eyes now you're well on your way
I bend and fold at your request
Now it's my time to take a step
I closed my eyes now you're well on your way

I fell asleep on your deathbed
In a hole where your head rests
I'm facing truth so unfamiliar
I just close my eyes and
Fall asleep on your deathbed
Can we be resurrected?
I'm facing truth so unfamiliar
I'm your saint, will you be my savior?
