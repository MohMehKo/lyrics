Wanting to breathe, needing to see
Our struggles are unparalleled
Searching for an answer
We're looking to those who seem to be free
Cover it up to show the unlikely
Who could pull this off in reality?

We've had it made so far
Living off of our unanswered calls
We have grown up to be
People that we've never wanted seen
We've already been seen

The faces that you hide behind
Will only make us realize
That you can't see the problem
We've made out of ourselves
And now we only need
A second to rethink
Cause its time to do more than just stare at the ground

We're asking questions
Where answers can't be found
