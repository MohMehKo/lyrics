Just keep in mind that we kill time
Just keep in mind that we kill time

Speak up out loud
Take in the sounds
Indulge in self-awareness
Enter the grounds
Where dead men walk
Where people feel
But do not talk
But do not talk

Nothing is remembered
Only read in books
Can't tell between
My dreams and reality
Nothing is remembered
Nothing left but me

Speak up out loud
On hollow ground
Can't look forward to an old life
My pain is just a continuation
Nothing is left but death and confusion
Nothing is remembered
Nothing is remembered

Just keep in mind that we kill time
Just keep in mind that we kill time
We kill time
We kill time
