A cold night wasn't trouble
enough for him
another swallow never seemed
like enough him
they say the past is the past
but it never treated me like this
he couldn't ask for
a better understanding of how 
what goes around 
comes back around twice as fast
he's got no hope for a cure
so he'll put himself to sleep

Now we just sit back, we sit back
while we watch all of them react

So tell me what to tell you
when the world wont listen
the start to the finish
Come on and let me hear it
Speak out and use up
all the time you're given
The start to the finish
Come on and let me hear it
Go on
Go ahead and tell your story

She always hoped for
him to take her word for word
never knew what it felt like felling this unsure
she's got her eyes on the time
but there's no use waiting there for him
she's not in the world alone
but she wanted to put herself to sleep

and now we just sit back, we sit back
while we watch all of them react
