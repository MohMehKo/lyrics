I saw just what it does
When it's too hard for you to face it
They're still pushing you to make it
It's been nothing new to me
Cause it's all been done before
Four years and we're still counting down
Until all your precious time is wasted
It's been no new news to me

We still haven't grown accustomed to the sound
As they all begin to drown you out
It's all been done before

When your deadlines become my days and nights
I'll take all your favorite lines
When you needed it the most
As your deadlines end tonight

And you were startled by the fact
That you could've had it better off by now
It’s not over until the quiet are calmed down
Oh, yes
Maybe it’s too plain to stand on solid ground
It got old but you can't blame it all on me

We still haven't grown accustomed to the sound
As they all begin to drown you out
It's all been done before

When your deadlines become my days and nights
I'll take all your favorite lines
When you needed it the most
As your deadlines end tonight

I saw just what it does
When it's too hard for you to face it
They're still pushing you to make it
It's been nothing new to me
It's all been done before

When your deadlines become my days and nights
I'll take all your favorite lines
When you needed it the most
As your deadlines end tonight

Please don't give up when your deadlines become my days and nights
I'll take all your favorite lines
When you needed it the most
As your deadlines end tonight.
