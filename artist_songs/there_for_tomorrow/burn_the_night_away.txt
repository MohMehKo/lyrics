It's 3 in the morning
And I'm still not sleeping
Cause I am finally running your race
The mountains you've been climbing seem like they have steepened 
Since I decided to pick up the pace

If the whole world told me I should disappear
Could I fall right next to you?

Just let me burn the night away
Oh, baby let me burn the night away
By thinking of the simple things you say to me
That get me through the day
You keep me wide awake
You keep me wide awake

So don't look back the hour glass is running empty
You've got me buried with your every move
Your fine line have me at a loss of memory
I'm right beside you in an empty room

If the whole world told me I should disappear
Could I fall right next to you?

Just let me burn the night away
Oh, baby let me burn the night away
By thinking of the simple things you say to me
That get me through the day
And it's so hard to catch your feelings
When you always run away
You keep me wide awake
You keep me wide awake

Your making it hard for me to just start
Over like we're new
Oh, the whole world told me I should disappear cause I'm fallling in love with you

Just let me burn the night away
Oh, baby let me burn the night away
By thinking of the simple things you say to me
That get me through the day
And it's so hard to catch your feelings 
When you always run away
You keep me wide awake
You keep me wide awake
