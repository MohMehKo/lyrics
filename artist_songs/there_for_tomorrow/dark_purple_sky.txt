I heard a knocking on my front door in the middle of the night
On this abandoned road, this lonely home
I see the lighting of the figure in the pebble night
She said, "Come with me, come with me"

This dark purple sky, let's set it ablaze, ablaze
Light up the night. I wanna set it ablaze, ablaze

I heard the footsteps coming like a freight train all through the town
There's no time to be a lookout so don't put that ear to the ground

This dark purple sky, let's set it ablaze, ablaze
Light up the night. I wanna set it ablaze, ablaze

It's a cold hard world just waiting for some changes
There's no one left except for you and I
I'm so sick and tired of the colors always fading
In this dark purple sky

Let's set it ablaze [x2]

This dark purple sky, let's set it ablaze, ablaze
Light up the night. I wanna set it ablaze, ablaze

Set it ablaze

Colors always fading.
