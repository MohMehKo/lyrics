I don't need your sense of compromise.
Shake you up and put you right back down to size.
Yeah, one by one.

Watch 'em fall.
Now I'm picking up the pieces.

I can stare your picture on the wall.
Stare it down to think you know it's all your fault.
Yeah, one by one.

Watch 'em fall.
Now I'm picking up the pieces to let all.
Yeah, to wear off.

I would claim that only for one night.
Feed you dust and put you right back down to size.

Watch 'em fall.
Now I'm picking up the pieces to let all.
