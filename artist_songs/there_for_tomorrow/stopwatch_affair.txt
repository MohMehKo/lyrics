Time takes us back, from going through motions.
By daydream of friends are flown victim to cold hard facts
It's so hard to be patient,
When quicksand is traded for dust from the past
To prove on, to prove on, move on.

The changing of times will blow over,
We can runaway (runaway), runaway
The minute hand stopped for a second,
And we're waiting for the stopwatch affair, stopwatch affair.

We're something special, we look so much the same.
No difference between, the subtle intake.
Well, you can take my hand, we can take a break.
Imagine a time where there's time left to take.
To prove on, to prove on, move on.

The changing of times will blow over
We can runaway (runaway), runaway
The minute hand stopped for a second,
And we're waiting for the stopwatch affair.

We hold our own, hold our own,
Where were you going?
Time left us no room to spare.

Now the changing of times will blow over,
We can runaway (runaway), runaway
The minute hand stopped for a second,
And we're waiting for the stopwatch affair, stopwatch affair, stopwatch affair (move on)
Stopwatch affair (move on)
