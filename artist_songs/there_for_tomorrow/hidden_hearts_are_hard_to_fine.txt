An unknown future
Brought by an unknown past
Our lies are golden
A scattered mass

Snakes impaled on knives of justice
Justice seems too far to reach
Reach is what we really see
Sight is blind as blind can be

An unknown future
Brought by an unknown past
Our lies are golden
A scattered mass

Sounds of silence speak my mind
Minds confuse the thoughts inside
Inside close doors we all hide
Hidden hearts are hard to find

An unknown future
Brought by an unknown past
Our lies are golden
A scattered mass

An unknown future
An unknown future
An unknown future
An unknown future
