Something wrong with me
I'm not getting along with me
My eyes pasted on the ceiling
I can't get my mind to stop working

I knew all the blackest blues
You were all my favorite tunes
This was all I had to lose

Tried out for size
to my surprise
I can't fit in anybody's arms
No more disguise
Cause I realize
I can't fit in anybody's arms
Oh you, oh you left just in time

Should have known to turn
Get ahead of the curve but I've learned
the failure sounds all to familiar to me
to just keep my mind to stop working

I knew all the blackest blues
You were all my favorite tunes
This was all I had to lose

Tried out for size
to my surprise
I can't fit in anybody's arms
No more disguise
Cause I realize
I can't fit in anybody's arms
Oh you, oh you left just in time

As the light
Darkens again
I lose myself within
Cause in the end
Still I'm reminded
Still I'm reminded

Tried out for size
to my surprise
I can't fit in anybody's arms
No more disguise
Cause I realize
I can't fit in anybody's arms
Tried out for size
I can't fit in anybody's arms
No more disguise
Cause I realize
I can't fit in anybody's arms
Oh you, oh you left just in time
You left just in time
