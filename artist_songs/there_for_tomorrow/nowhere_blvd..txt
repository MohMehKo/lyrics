I found a road where they colour coated my pledge of allegance
Cleaned out my soul, gave me the old ways to deal with my demons
See past the smoke, they cover scars just to shadow the weakness
Not found alone, see only nothing for miles upon my house

I was chasing down the feeling I get when I touch the sky (touch the sky)
Dancing through changes all into the morning light
Now it's you and I going no where, no where tonight.

Well it's always cloudy, 'cause I'm burning tires to break through the ceiling
Fill in the blank, 'cause I'm saying nothing, nothing you would want to miss
Hope to win over all the promises
Lock away our confidence
They say forever, forever, whatever.

I was chasing down the feeling I get when I touch the sky (touch the sky)
Dancing through changes all into the morning light
Now with you and I going no where, no where tonight.

We're going separate ways, on nowhere boulevard.
We're going separate ways, on nowhere boulevard.
There's no more time to make, on nowhere boulevard.
We waste away our days, on nowhere boulevard.

Chasing down the feeling I get when I touch the sky (touch the sky)
Dancing through changes all into the morning light
Trying to be the dazzled, clip my wings to stop my flight

Now it's you and I, going no where, no where tonight
We're going seperate ways, on nowhere boulevard
We're going seperate ways, on nowhere boulevard
We waste away our days on nowhere boulevard.
