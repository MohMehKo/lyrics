Well, I was hoping I could crash the course you made out of imagination.
I feel it, do you feel it?
'Cause I don't want to get by.

If pleasure is the ultimate weapon,
Then what's to say I'm bad on the pain?
Well, passion is like a school in session,
You better think of something clever to say.

You look desperate by be friending the cool kids,
But how long will the popular take?
The tension's building up, like a fever,
You gotta wonder when the hell it'll break.

Well, I was hoping I could crash the course you made out of imagination.
I feel it, do you feel it?
'Cause I don't want to get by, this time.

It's too early to find out how it works for you,
You might as well be showing them plaid.
If it's you got stitching out on a hard pursuit,
I hope you're planning on having to wait.

'Cause all I want to do is throw a price on you,
Count you like a number then continue to do what I must,
Do what I must to get paid, to get played.

Well, I was hoping I could crash the course you made out of imagination.
I feel it, do you feel it?
'Cause I don't want to get by, this time.
'Cause I don't want to get by.
It's been lonely here lately when you're on the other side.

When you're on the other side.
So what's it like to be you,
so one of a kind?
So what's it like to be you,
on the other side?

Well, I was hoping I could crash the course you made out of imagination.
I feel it, do you feel it?
'Cause I don't want to get by.

'Cause I was broken, till I put you back together from imagination.
Hear me, do you hear me?
I don't want to get by, this time.
It's been lonely here lately,
When you're on the other side.
