You've got to know by now
That stepping in and out won't bring you down
Until you make it definite.
6:15 sacrifice your rest
I thought you said you're different
From those who believe in it
They believe (in Universities)

Oh, not another mind made up
For doing nothing more than all you see
They've got no more room to breathe
Until we just get them to

Say we'll make them say
That we've been down and out all day
If your education brings you home
Why are you still away?

So give it up if you're not still trying to
Hold it up in your four time windowed room
I've got the feeling that you're not
Using up all of your best bets
On plans that you still don't have set
For those who believe in it
They believe...
Until we just get them to

Say we'll make them say
That we've been down and out all day
If your education brings you home
Why are you still away

See we'll make them see
That we've got no more room to breathe
If your education brings you home
Why are you still away

I gave it all?
The thought you said you needed?
But the minutes got repeated?
For too long, Far too long?

Can you save us all
From the thought you said you needed?
Cause I feel like I've competed?
For too long, Far too long??

We've got no more room to breathe?
Until we just get them to see?
We've got no more room to breathe?
Until we just get them to...

Say we'll make them say
That we've been down and out all day
If your education brings you home
Why are you still away?

See we'll make them see
That we've got no more room to breathe
If your education brings you home
Why are you still away
