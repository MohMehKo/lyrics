Nighttime is darker than normal,
My days are crooked and informal,
I cannot sleep with happiness
The pain is beating in my chest,

Am I talking to myself?
Are my words being wasted?
On your time
But I won't die

Last time I told you to side me,
I cannot ask for sympathy,
I cannot sleep with happiness
The pain is beating in my chest,

Am I talking to myself?
Are my words being wasted?
On your time
But I won't die

Am I talking to myself?
Are my words being wasted?
On your time

But I won't die...
