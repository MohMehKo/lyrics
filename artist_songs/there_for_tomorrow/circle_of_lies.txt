You're too busy laying passed out on the floor, on the floor
Sitting pretty, had it mapped out from before, from before hand
Are you feeling the pressure from cigarette burns
You're learning your lesson from taking your turns
Fall away
Fall away

I could run for days, days in your circle of lies
Spin me around, round your head with your goodbyes
Come to pass, pass me by!

In the city where you've got nowhere left to run, left to run
You can hop the fences, but you better not jump the gun, jump the gun
I could run for days, days in your circle of lies
Spin me around, round your head with your goodbyes
Come to pass, pass me by!

Saw you in your tracks, make you come right back to life.

Baby let's call it quits while we're both ahead of time, time
Playing with consequence, didn't you read between the lines, the lines?
Fall away
Fall away

'Cause I could run for days, days in your circle of lies
Spin me around, round your head with your goodbyes
Come to pass, pass me by!

Come to pass, pass me by.
I could run for days, I could run for days
Come to pass, pass me by.
I could run for days, I could run for days
Come to pass, pass me by.
I could run for days, I could run for days
Come to pass, pass me by.
Days in your circle of lies
So goodbye.
