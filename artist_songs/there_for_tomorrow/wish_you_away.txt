Where do you go when you listen
To nobody else but yourself?
Where do you go?
You're so far from the willing
You're in such a rush not to tell
So where do you go?
Oh, when getting in where you fit in doesn't get you one single thing,
Where will you go?
When the secrets that you've been keeping get a hold of nothing at all,
I'd like to know

Can I wish you away
Until you find your place
In this world it's so hard to get a feel
And all you do is wait for that one little taste
You're so caught up inside to know what's real
But until you've had all you can take
I'll wish you away

So where do you go when forgetting what you had in store for yourself?
Drags me along...
Because you keep running in circles
You're blinded by everything
Just ask me if I know where to go
(Where to go...)

Can I wish you away
Until you find your place
In this world it's so hard to get a feel
And all you do is wait for that one little taste
You're so caught up inside to know what's real
But until you've had all you can take...
Oh, but until you've had all you can take...

Can I wish you away?
(Would you really go there alone?)
Can I wish you away?
(Would you really go there alone?)

You said you'd be gone just another minute
You're too far off to still be in it
Don't act like your sleeping when I can see you're wide awake

Can I wish you away
Until you find your place
In this world it's so hard to get a feel
And all you do is wait for that one little taste
You're so caught up inside to know what's real

(Can I wish you away)
Can I wish you away
Until you find your place
In this world it's so hard to get a feel
(Can I wish you away)
And all you do is wait for that one little taste
You're so caught up inside to know what's real
But until you've had all you can take
I'll wish you away
