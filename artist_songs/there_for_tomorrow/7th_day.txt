Confession without a voice
Stab me in the back my friend
Twist it without a choice
Help me to comprehend

Like a fallen angel
Sent down here from the sun
Like a premonition
Of the new world to come

Now confession arises
And I'm bleeding out a wound
A hole sits in my heart
Left a remnants of my past

Like a fallen angel
Sent down here from the sun
Like a premonition
Of the new world to come

You watched the world on rise
And made a new beginning
You'll watch watch us fail the end
Of an old world falling

Confession without a voice
