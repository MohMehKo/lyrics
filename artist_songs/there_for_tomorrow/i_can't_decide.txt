Cold afternoon
I sleep in some 
Back of the room 
Avoid the sun
You turned off the light and I lost a lung
You called it a night
You had me won
Who told you to leave me all alone
Leave me in the dark
Leave me in the cold
Who told you to leave before I could show
You half of the man you wanted to know
But I had to face your last goodbye
But I had to face your last goodbye
The look on my face 
My bloodshot eyes
So who won the war
Deep down inside
I can't decide
I can't decide
Only the dark can feel my touch
No kind of remark could burn this much
Cause I'm as cold as december 
And I won't surrender
Until you give me back my life
Who told you to leave me all alone
Leave me in the dark
Leave me in the cold
Who told you to leave before I could show
You half of the man you wanted to know
But I had to face your last goodbye
But I had to face your last goodbye
The look on my face 
My bloodshot eyes
So who won the war 
Deep down inside
I can't decide
I can't decide
I can't see the sun in the morning
Please send me a warning
Next time I go through this again
All out of luck
All out of time
Who would have thought I'd lose my mind
No I can't decide
I can't decide
Who told you to leave me all alone
Leave me in the dark 
Leave me in the cold
Who told you to leave before I could show 
You half of the man you wanted to know
But I had to face your last goodbye
But I had to face your last goodbye
The look on my face 
My bloodshot eyes
So who won the war 
Deep down inside
I can't decide
No I can't decide
