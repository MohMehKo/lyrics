The air is tired in this place
my consciousness is lost
Are you satisfied to see me now

Do you like what you see?
Why are we so empty?
Your sense and understanding
Wish I caught this before
When I had time for explanation

Are youÂ rise [?] to see me fail this many times?
Caught up in a lie when you think you are right

Do you like what you see?
Why are we so empty?
Your sense and understanding
Wish I caught this before
When I had time for explanation

Your advice was taken

Why are we so empty?
Your sense and understanding
Wish I caught this before
When I had time for explanation

Why not pay attention
to all that is inside
Wish I caught this before
When I had time for explanation

Your mistake!
