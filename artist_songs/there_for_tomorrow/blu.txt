I felt a hand pull me deeper under.
It always makes me wonder was it you?
I met somebody else, (the) impression I fell under
It felt an awful lot like it was you.

Was it you caught my attention?
Was it you showed your face anywhere but here?
I'd like to see you go.

I see BLU underwater next to you.
The Seven seas don't have a clue of where to hide someone like you.
I see BLU underwater next to you.
Every wave brings me bad news, oooh oh.

I love the deep end, it holds me so much closer.
I'm drowning in the flood I know as you

Was it you caught my attention?
Was it you showed your face anywhere but here?
I'd like to see you go.

I see BLU underwater next to you.
The Seven seas don't have a clue of where to hide someone like you.
I see BLU underwater next to you.
Every wave brings me bad news, news.

I'm scaling half the ocean, burying your name,
But I found the seas all frozen after coming all this way.

I See BLU underwater next to you.
The Seven seas don't have a clue of where to hide someone like you.
I See BLU underwater next to you.
Every wave brings me bad news, news.
