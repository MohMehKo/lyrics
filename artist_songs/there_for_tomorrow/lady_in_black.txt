You can't find a reason why the world keeps passing by
You occupy these changing seasons
With the flooded streets of night
'Cause this youthful advantage fades while the sand is
Dripping from the hour glass
You wanna taste of the fast life but nobody sleeps tight
When the after hours pass

Don't hang your head so low
There's no turning back
You put on quite a show
There's no turning back
Lady in black

Hit the scene, something's missing
Where's the sparkle in your eye?
You're up so high
Everybody's listening to the static of the night
'Cause this youthful advantage fades while the sand is
Dripping from the hour glass
Now they're dimming the house lights
You know it don't feel right
Wishing that this moment would last

Don't hang your head so low
There's no turning back
You put on quite a show
There's no turning back
Lady in black

I came to let you know
There's no turning back

Baby, don't get lost in the grey chain smoke
With the petty hearts & the last to go
In the same three bars she goes back & forth
Hoping to find love

Don't hang your head so low
There's no turning back
You put on quite a show
There's no turning back
Lady in black

I came to let you know
There's no turning back
