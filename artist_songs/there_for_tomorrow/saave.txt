I am a third world product of inflation
Some second handed information down
So you can watch me burn
I am a good boy with some bad ideas
The only child of all your fears, now

These days will play along like when we were imbeciles.
I'm done, done, with the same old, same old.
Sift from something more than just a common cold
I'm done, done, with the same old, same old.
Save, me from the light.

I am a pure few for all your fires.
The spitting image of your worst desires
Now, sit back and live and learn.
So come on now and get it right
It's only alone and a waste of time
Just come down.

These days will play along like when we were imbeciles.
I'm done, done, with the same old, same old.
Sift from something more than just a common cold
I'm done, done, with the same old, same old.
Save.

I can be a mean, I can show what you've made.
Burning to the ceiling, so I can spark a flame.

These days will play along like when we were imbeciles.
I'm done, done, with the same old, same old.
Sift from something more than just a common cold
I'm done, done, with the same old, same old.

So kiss me goodbye,
'Cause I die until tomorrow for the better life
Save.
