Now you've caught me, hey, red handed
Up on the steers, unworthy

[Chorus:]
What have I done?
Listing me away
We're all criminals in the eyes of God
Crush our habits with our hands
For the signs
We don't lie
Sing a lie

I see your paw prints coming down
Shattered glass don't make a sound

[Chorus:]
What have I done?
Listing me away
We're all criminals in the eyes of God
Crush our habits with our hands
We're all criminals in the eyes of God
Crush our habits with our hands

[Solo]

[Repeat chorus x2]

For the signs!
We don't lie!
Sing a lie!
