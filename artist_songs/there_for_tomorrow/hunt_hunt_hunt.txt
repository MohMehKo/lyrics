No need to explain cause I know your story
You're making the claims to have the guts and glory
You're sad, sad, sadly mistaken
You're steady mistakes give me a bloody rush
We burn at the stake, why you keep bashing your love?
You're sad, sad, sadly mistaken

So let me make you familiar
You say you're going up, I beg to differ
I think you're going straight on down, down, down
In a hell of gunfire

I'm a hunt, hunt for your chemicals
I've got the lust, lust for the criminal in you
Just trust me, cause I'll be honest
You think you got it all but I think you lost it
You're a fake or a fraud
But you're a better one naturally

Remove out the sound of every single footstep
You're laying it down as you sing yourself away,
Your sad little songs tonight

So let me make you familiar
You say you're going up, I beg to differ
I think you're going straight on down, down, down
In a hell of gunfire

I'm a hunt, hunt for your chemicals
I've got the lust, lust for the criminal in you
Just trust me, cause I'll be honest
You think you got it all but I think you lost it
You're a fake or a fraud
But you're a better one naturally, naturally

So watch you're saying
Who you're playing
Cause I'm about to make you tame

I'm a hunt, hunt for your chemicals
I've got the lust, lust for the criminal in you
Just trust me, cause I'll be honest
You think you got it all but I think you lost it
You're a fake or a fraud
But you're a better one naturally

You're a fake or a fraud
But you're a better one naturally
