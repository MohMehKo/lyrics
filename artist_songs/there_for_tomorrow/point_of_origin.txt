Love made life along with day
Infiltrate our peace with hate
In our broken, torn piece of mine
My eyes were blinded
My eyes were blinded

To frame our still pictures of sinful nature
Is what we find ourselves in
[?]
Is what we find ourselves in
But we still don't
But we still don't
But we still don't
Try to pay our respects to our creation

To sacrifice ourselves
Too caught up in ourselves
Too much pride in ourselves
But we still don't give ourselves

But we still don't

But we still don't
But we still don't
But we still don't give ourselves
