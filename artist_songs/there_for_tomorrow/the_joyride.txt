Never say you could, if you couldn't,
Never say you will if you won't come any, closer,
Then you already are, you already are,
You don't need an army to soldier on,
Savor the dark to turn the lights up brighter,
Then ever before, then ever before,
Are you over going under when everybody else is going higher,
So much higher, so come up with me,
So I'm taking the joyride, going else-where I suppose,
I'm taking the joyride, to somewhere I don't know,
Let's take the high road, (lets take the high road)
We can kiss the sky with flaming lips,
And deny ever sparking fires, all these fires,
So burn up with me,
Well I'm taking the joyride, going elsewhere I suppose,
I'm taking the joyride, to somewhere I don't know,
Let's take the high road, to where ever you are,
Let's take the high road, to where ever you are,
And we could drive miles away, miles away,
Take me away, miles away,
(Never say you could if you couldn't,
Never say you could if you couldn't,)
Never say you could if you couldn't,
Never say you will if you won't come any closer,
Then you already are, you already are,
Let's take the joyride, going elsewhere I suppose,
I'm taking the joyride, to somewhere I don't know,
Let's take the high road (high road) to where ever you are,
Let's take the high road (high road) to where ever you are,
So we could drive miles away,
Miles away.
