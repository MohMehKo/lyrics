Hold my tongue
I'm speechless, immobilized.
Bruised by a former love
We were drawn & quartered, neutralized.

So, let's carve the way back to the start
Cast aside those battle scars
Lighten up these heavy hearts of ours
Chase me thru the bends & breaks
Watch the walls all fade away
It's never over,
'Til we say it's over.

This racing blood will take us far from home
We will make it out alive
In the flood we'll always stay afloat
We will make it out alive

Rest my soul
I've been sleepless thru the night
So bent
We're all so hell-bent on redemption
All the signs read mis-direction
but it feels so close

Chase me thru the bends & breaks
Watch the walls all fade away
It's never over,
'Til we say it's over.

This racing blood will take us far from home
We will make it out alive
In the flood we'll always stay afloat
We will make it out alive
