Oh, poor little me, yeah, I've traveled near and far without you
But you just come and go and I just pay the toll
It's taken years for me to realize that all good things
They come in time, these dreams, so broken down
Scattered across this house we've built for two
Family and friends all say it's nice but this place won't suffice
I've got an extra vice or two since I saw you

Oh oh, since I saw you
There's nothing left, nothing left to lose
Just me and my own thoughts inside this tomb

Can I bring it back to life?
So we can make it right
I wanna bring this back to life, life, life
So we can make it right

Can't see my worth through
No, I'm way too high and you're way too foolproof
I'll stare a hole right through this wall
Why you miss all my calls, yeah

Oh oh, since I saw you (Oh, since I saw you)
There's nothing left, nothing left to lose
(No, there's nothing left to lose)
Just me and my own thoughts inside this tomb (Ooh)

Can I bring it back to life?
So we can make it right
I wanna bring this back to life, life, life
So we can make it right

I'd give anything to forget, forget this
But I can't seem to escape, escape this game
(Escape this game) Escape this game
I'd give anything to forget, forget you
But I can't seem to escape, escape your name

Can I bring it back to life?
(Anything to forget, forget this but I can't seem to escape, escape)
So we can make it right
(Escape this game) Escape this game
I wanna bring this back to life, life, life
(Anything to forget, forget you but I can't seem to escape, escape)
So we can make it right

Oh oh, since I saw you
There's nothing left, nothing left to lose
Just me and my own thoughts inside this tomb
Yeah, yeah, yeah
