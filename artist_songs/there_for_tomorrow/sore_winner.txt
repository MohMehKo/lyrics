I walk, you run 
Feel so outdone 
You always wanted it to be one on one
I cost, you're free 
Make me believe 
That you've been innocent 'til proven guilty

So, scrape my hands and knees
Softer now, I plead for your forgiveness 'cause the world can't stand to witness
You keep tearing me down looks like I met my match today

Play me in everything
Make me a rival
But you still don't see that you're
Sore winner, a sore winner
Losing is not your thing
You can't hold the title
But you still don't see that you're
Sore winner, a sore winner

I want, you feed 
Pick up your speed
There can't be saving if it's already been won
I play for keeps but you don't listen
Remember me? I'm what your missing
Missing out on (Missing out on)
Stuck in this competition

So, scrape my hands and knees
Softer now, I read your mindless interest as we're coming down to inches
You keep tearing me down looks like I met my match today

Play me in everything
Make me a rival
But you still don't see that you're
Sore winner, a sore winner
Losing is not your thing
You can't hold the title
But you still don't see that you're
Sore winner, a sore winner

Play me in everything
Make me a rival
But you still don't see that you're
Sore winner, a sore winner
Losing is not your thing
You can't hold the title
But you still don't see that you're (Still don't see that you're)
Sore winner, a sore winner

Play me in everything (Play me!)
Make me a rival (Make me!)
But you still don't see that you're
A sore winner

Realness...
