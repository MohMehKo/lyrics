I'd be changing if I were you
I'd be changing if I were you
Get a hold of yourself (why don't you)
Get a hold of yourself
Dollar on your pillow to steal your tooth
Dollar on your pillow to steal your tooth
Share a bit of the wealth (I know you)
Get a hold of yourself

There you go
Pulling favours, pulling favors like you would
Best of luck
Cross your fingers, cross your fingers like you should

Yeah, I've been through all your lies
Oh yeah
And I'm watching from a distance
Your life like pantomime

Get what you take and take what you get
Get what you take and take what you get
Get a hold of yourself (why don't you)
Wonder what's next, to sink or swim?
Wonder what's next, to sink or swim?
Share a bit of the wealth (I know you)
Get a hold of yourself.

There you go
Pulling favours, pulling favors like you would
Best of luck
Cross your fingers, cross your fingers like you should

Yeah, I've been through all your lies
Oh yeah
And I'm watching from a distance
Your life like pantomime

Was it something I did
Were you gone from the beginning?
Changing faces, switching places from the start.
Are you done giving in, to every role that you've been playing?
Spread the message of exactly who you are.
Get a hold of yourself.
Why don't you, get a hold of yourself?

There you go
Pulling favours, pulling favors like you would
Best of luck
Cross your fingers, cross your fingers like you should

Yeah, I've been through all your lies
Oh yeah
And I'm watching from a distance
Your life like pantomime
