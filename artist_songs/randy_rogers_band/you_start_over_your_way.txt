Well, you showed up looking just like I remember
Just like I knew you would
Worried if my heart was breaking just like it should
Working hard on your good time, showing off your new life
To God and everyone in this bar
I'll leave it to you, baby, you always had to be the star

[Chorus:]
But I've got the road less traveled 
My dreams unraveled 
A broken heart that suits me fine
Yeah, my load's a little lighter from a string of all-nighters
A bottle for killin' time
Honey, you start over your way, yeah, and I'll start over mine

If you're here to make amends
I'll let you rub it in
But I'm not gonna play the fool
Yeah, 'cause even if the rumors were true I could never tell you

[Repeat Chorus]

Well, you quit on me but, baby, I don't give up easy 
Yeah, well, I might look fine but looks can be deceiving 

[Repeat Chorus]
