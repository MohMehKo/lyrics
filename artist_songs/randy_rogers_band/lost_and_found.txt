Day after day, 
I tell myself you never meant the words that you said, 
Night after night I lie here alone, 
Can't get you out of my head, 
Like a fool I let our love slip away, 
Left me here what more can I say, 

[CHORUS:]
Missed my chance I lost my turn, 
My ship sank, I crashed and burned 
Broke your heart then I let myself 
down, Lost the fight I lost the game, 
Now there's only me to blame, 
If you wonder where I am check the 
lost and found. 

Time after time I fell short of the man you needed me to be, 
Lie after lie I left you no choice but to pack your clothes and leave, 
Got to much pride to beg you to stay, 
But before you go just let me say 

[CHORUS:]
Missed my chance I lost my turn, 
My ship sank, I crashed and burned 
Broke your heart then I let myself 
down, Lost the fight I lost the game, 
Now there's only me left to blame, 
If you wonder where I am check the 
lost and found.

My ship sank, I crashed and burned, 
Broke your heart then I let my selfdown, 
Lost the fight I lost the game, 
Now there's only me left to blame, 
If you wonder where I am check the lost and found. 
If you want to find me.
