You cant fool me, I can read you like a book
I can see that leavin in your eyes, I even know that look
You think that I don't know, You think I have no clue
I guess letting me down easy, was more than you could do

[Chorus]
But you could have left me, before I let you in
You could have left me, before we tried what might have been
You could have left me, before you did me wrong
But you cant leave me now, cuz I'm already gone

Well thats right its to late, yeah I left along time ago
You were to busy livin' it up, honey I was letting go
Well now don't act so sad, those tears aren't even real
You ain't ever gonna see me again, tell me how does that feel

[Chorus]

You could have left me, before I let you in
You could have left me, before we tried what might have been
You could have left me, before you did me wrong
But you cant leave me now, cuz I'm already gone

We used to talk about forever, Not so long ago
But forever is all over now, Don't act like you don't know

[Chorus]
