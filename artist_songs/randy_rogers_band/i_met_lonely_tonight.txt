I met lonely tonight
She was sitting at the table by a neon light
Pretend that everything's gonna be just fine
Wish I could tell you what was on her mind

I met lonely tonight
He was walking down the street in the pouring rain
Trying to find someone else to blame
Wish that I would call his name

I met lonely tonight and I didn't know what to do
I met lonely tonight, it reminded me of you
And I know it is not right, I didn't come here to fight
Yeah, but I met lonely tonight

I met lonely tonight
She was standing by herself, waiting for the bus
Pretty sure she'd already given up
That's what make me think about us

I met lonely tonight and I didn't know what to do
I met lonely tonight, it reminded me of you
And I know it's not right, I didn't come here to fight
Yeah, but I met lonely tonight

So tell me to leave
When I do lock that door
I don't understand
You don't want me anymore

And I know it is not right, I didn't come here to fight
Yeah, but I met lonely tonight

I met lonely tonight
I was staring in the mirror, so I close my eyes
