Wish I were back, on Copano Bay
With my sail rig up, soakin up some rays
Thinkin back, about life on the bay
I'm captain of my memory
As my thoughts drift away

In my mind I still feel,
The rhythm of the waves
Part of me stayed on Copano Bay,
Never left behind

Windin down, enjoying friends,
And catchin Reds
Sailing high, in the night
That's the life I've lived

Today I'm crestin,
On a land lover's dream
Tomorrow I'll be sailing on Copano's gleam

In my mind I still feel,
The rhythm of the waves
Part of me stayed on Copano Bay,
Never left behind

Today I'm crestin,
On a land lover's dream
Tomorrow I'll be sailing on Copano's gleam

In my mind I still feel,
The rhythm of the waves
Part of me stayed on Copano Bay,
Never left behind

Today I'm crestin,
On a land lover's dream
Tomorrow I'll be sailing on Copano's gleam

Yeah tomorrow I'll be sailing on Copano's gleam
