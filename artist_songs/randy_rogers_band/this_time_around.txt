I used to be crazy, yeah they called me a fool 
I guess I wasn't myself back when I wanted you 
I see you comin round again, that same lookin your eye 
I'd have to be crazy, to fall again for your lies 

I'm gonna break these chains around my broken heart 
You could have had it once but you tore it all apart 
I'm gonna throw your lying eyes over my left shoulder 
Not gonna let you wear your crown, this time around 

No I can't stay a little longer, I gotta be on my way 
I've heard a thousand times, everything you have to say 
I'll show myself to the door and I'll turn out your light 
I'll get in my car, you'll be alone again tonight 

I'm gonna break these chains around my broken heart 
You could have had it once but you tore it all apart 
I'm gonna throw your lying eyes over my left shoulder 
Not gonna let you wear your crown, this time around 

Never thought I'd be so cold, what'd you expect me to do 
Can't put it all on hold, I learned it all from you 

I'm gonna break these chains around my broken heart 
You could have had it once but you tore it all apart 
I'm gonna throw your lying eyes over my left shoulder 
Not gonna let you wear your crown, this time around
