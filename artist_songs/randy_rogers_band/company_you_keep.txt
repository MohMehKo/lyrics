Guess you've heard by now that I've decided
Well I'm not gonna waste any more time on you
It was quite a flame that we've ignited
Its too bad that you had such a hard time staying true

I don't know where all this trouble started
Yea when we jumped, I guess I sank too deep
I don't hold it against the way we parted
I just blame it on the company you keep.

Don't blame me
If I don't send you roses anymore
Don't blame me
If I don't kiss your hand and hold the door.
Well there's just too many others
And I hate to compete
So honey when I'm gone you can blame it on the company you keep.

Well I had to watch your promises expire
Like a coupon in the Sunday classifides
I use to cry but now I'm just too damn tired
One thing is for sure, cant say I never tried

Don't blame me
If I don't send you roses anymore
Don't blame me
If I don't kiss your hand and hold the door.
Well there's just too many others
And I hate to compete
So honey when I'm gone you can blame it on the company you keep
