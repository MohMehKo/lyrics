Good times come, then they go
Rain will fall, wind will blow
Through it all you got to know
I’ll do what I can do
To protect you, right or wrong
Heal the hurt, till the hurt is gone
I’ll be right where I belong, 
I’ll be here for you

[Chorus:]
I’ll be here when the sky turns gray
Sun goes blind and the moon won't stay
I’ll be the light to guide your way
Onto someplace new

I'll be here when the crowd is gone
Last note fades on the very last song
I’ll be the road to take you home
I’ll be here for you

When your star falls from the sky
And your wings don't want to fly
Just remember I'm standing by
To help to see you things through
Cause better days will come again
Clouds will break, your heart will mend
I'll be right where I've always been
I'll be here for you

[Chorus:]
I’ll be here when the sky turns gray
Sun goes blind and the moon won't stay
I’ll be the light to guide your way
Onto someplace new

I'll be here when the crowd is gone
Last note fades on the very last song
I’ll be the road to take you home
I’ll be here for you
