Peace of mind combined with everything you didn't say
Leaves me lonely only for the night. And everyday
You always run away from me and I run away from you

It's all the same I'm ashamed it had to turn out this way
Now every time reminds me how it's all a big clich√à
You always run away from me and I run away from you

And I wish this time you would be mine for good
But the reason why you never stay is you say
You didn't know you could

Didn't know you could turn back right then 
And spend your life with someone you just let go

A once in a lifetime blind love never saw the light of day
It cost us forever for better or for worse
And that's the price we pay 

And I wish this time you would be mine for good
But the reason why you never stay is you say
You didn't know you could

And you always ran away from me 
And I always knew you would
And you say the reason why you never stay
