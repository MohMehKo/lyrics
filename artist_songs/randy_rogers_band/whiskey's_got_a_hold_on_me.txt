I don't know who I am
Or why I take it this far 
I wish i could find myself
But I don't know where you are
Woke up a little too late
Wearin the same old shirt
Maybe I started a little too soon
I'm already slurrin' my words

[Chorus]
Whiskey's got a hold on me I can't help myself
I've been lost since you took off can't see me with anyone else
Cuz Whiskey's got a hold on me

Got a pair of bloodshot eyes
Everything to lose
Drown myself every night at this bar
It's yesterday's news
Last call at 2 am
Always tells the truth
I can tell when the lights come on
I'm still not over you

[Chorus]
