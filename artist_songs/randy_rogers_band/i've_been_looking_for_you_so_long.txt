Trying to find my way around here
But there's no street signs in this town
It's getting dark, I can hardly see
'Cause all the lights are burned out
I tried to stop somewhere and ask
But all the stores are closed down
Where the hell am I
Where in the hell are you tonight

I've been looking for you so long
Down every road I've been on 
Every empty glass and every jukebox sad song
I've been lying to myself
And everyone can tell
Since you've been gone
I've been looking for you so long

I know I'm the reason why 
Your shattered heart is on the run
Doubt I deserve a second chance
But I'd do anything to get one
The more I try to get back to you
The more it all comes undone
Where the hell am I
Where in the hell are you tonight

I've been looking for you so long
Down every road I've been on 
Every empty glass and every jukebox sad song
I've been lying to myself
And everyone can tell
Since you've been gone
I've been looking for you so long

I'm lost, I'm trying to find you here
In someone else's town
In the middle of nowhere 
Out of gas
Watching people pass me by

I've been looking for you so long
Down every road I've been on 
Every empty glass and every jukebox sad song
I've been lying to myself
And everyone can tell
Since you've been gone
I've been looking for you so long

I've been looking for you so long
