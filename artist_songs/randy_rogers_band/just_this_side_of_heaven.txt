Just this side of heaven
Was an angel in cowboy boots
Auburn hair, big brown eyes
And a funny little smile
Changed my world, for a little while

I met you just this side of heaven
While living just this side of hell
Love with you, it was full of beauty
Cause you flew, wish I could too

I wish she had told me her secret
How angels never stay
They are here for awhile
And it feels so right
Don't go tryin to hold them too tight
