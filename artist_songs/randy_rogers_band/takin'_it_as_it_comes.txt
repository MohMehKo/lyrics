I'm takin' it as it comes
And you know that it comes to everyone
I'm just sittin' back here, gettin' high and drinking beer
I'm just takin' it as it comes

Well you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't
Makes a man stop and wonder if he will or he won't
But now I'm in my prime, I'm enjoying my time
I was too busy chasin' life, 'stead of livin' mine

I'm takin' it as it comes
And you know that it comes to everyone
I'm just sittin' back here, gettin' high and drinking beer
I'm just takin' it as it comes

Well eat more possum and God bless John Wayne
Seems like everybody wants to be a cowboy these days
You know riding deranged, it's either rank stock or strange
It's all in the luck and the buck and the draw, how tight you're holding your reins

I'm takin' it as it comes
And you know that it comes to everyone
I'm just sittin' back here, gettin' high and drinking beer
I'm just takin' it as it comes

I'm takin' it as it comes
And you know that it comes to everyone
I'm just sittin' back here, gettin' high and drinking beer
I'm just takin' it as it comes

I'm just takin' it as it
I'm just takin' it as it 
I'm just takin' it as it comes
