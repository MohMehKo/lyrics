Girl, I wrote you a letter
A thousand old cliches but it's what I wanted to say
I brought you red roses, eleven just to shake it up
Cause a thousand's not enough
White tablecloth and candlelight
A man scared out of his life
Oh girl tonight

I know there's nothing new under that old moon
It's all been done before
And that love be true when I'm holdin' you
Girl you make that old moon new

Right now there must be a million
Lovers lookin' up just like us
Something tells me they can't see tonight the way I do
The secret is you
I know there's nothin' it ain't seen
I bet it laughs at fools like me

I know there's nothing new under that old moon
It's all been done before
And that love be true  when I'm holdin' you
Girl you make that old moon new

To that moon, all it is, just another front stardust porch kiss
Bet it's never seen me fall like this

I know there's nothing new under that old moon
It's all been done before
And that love be true  when I'm holdin' you
Girl you make that old moon new
