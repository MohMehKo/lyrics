Well I'm a whole lot better than I ought to be 
Don't know why things keep going right for me
All I've ever done is run wild and free
I'm a whole lot better than I ought to be

Well I guess I must've done something right
Some other time or place maybe some other life
There's no way I deserve how I've been blessed 
If it was up to me I'd still be a mess 

Cause I'm a whole lot better than I ought to be 
Don't know why things keep going right for me
All I've ever done is run wild and free
I'm a whole lot better than I ought to be

And oh I don't wanna wake up 
I just wanna keep living this dream
Oh I could never make up
Anything as good as what's happening to me

Well I try my best but I can do no wrong 
Blues come my way but they never stay long 
I thought I had it all when I didn't have a buck 
It ain't easy having all the luck

Well I'm a whole lot better than I ought to be 
Don't know why things keep going right for me
All I've ever done is run wild and free
I'm a whole lot better than I ought to be

All I've ever done is run wild and free
