Well I'm so sick and tired
Of all your hissy fits
We've got ireconsilable differences
If we could just say no to this relationship
We could be best friends with benefites

That's right that's what I said
That's the best thought I ever had
So what do you say
We've got nothing to lose
You get yours and I get mine
And that's where we draw the line
And now I'm leaving it up to you

I'm so sick and tired
Of all your hissy fits
We've got ireconsilable differences
If we could just say no to this relationship
We could be best friends with benefites

Well nobody's got to know
Do we really wanna let this go
Just cause we can't get along
Come on baby it's a full proof plan
Let me be your loving man
Can't see how this could go wrong

I'm so sick and tired
Of all your hissy fits
We've got ireconsilable differences
If we could just say no to this relationship
We could be best friends with benefites

Ive searched high and low
To find somebody new
But every road I travel down
Leads right back to you

I'm so sick and tired
Of all your hissy fits
We've got ireconsilable differences
If we could just say no to this relationship
We could be best friends with benefites
Come on let's be best friends with benefits
