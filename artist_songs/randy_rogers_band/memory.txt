The day she left me behind
I couldn't get her off my mind
Thinking about all the times we had
But I'm a new man now
Just don't ask me how
I know it's hard to believe
When that sun goes down
You can find me out painting the town
Drinking away what used to be
Cause I've got nothing to prove
And there's nothing left for me to lose
Nothing more to me than just a memory
Go out every night.
Up til the morning light
Having the time of my life
When I see you out with him
All I can do is grin
Glad it's not me whose missing out
When that sun goes down
You can find me out painting the town
Drinking away what used to be
Cause I've got nothing to prove
And there's nothing left for me to lose
Nothing more to me than just a memory
When that sun goes down
You can find me out painting the town
Drinking away what used to be
Cause I've got nothing to prove
And there's nothing left for me to lose
Nothing more to me than just a memory
