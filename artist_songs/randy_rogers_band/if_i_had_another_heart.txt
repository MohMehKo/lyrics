If I had another heart I'd be just fine and then some
I'd break the glass in case of an emergency and just use that one.
I'd take all that extra love, I know just what I'd do
Cause if I had another heart I'd let you break that one too.

Cause the one I've got's tore up, it's twisted inside out
It wants me to dial your number when I'm 2 whiskeys down
With a little extra help, I think I could start clean
And I just might get over you getting over me
But the truth is I'd fall right back in love with you
Cause if I had another heart I'd let you break that one too.

Wish I knew a place or a way to escape your memory
Lay it down and forget all about it like some hotel key
If I had another heart I'd know better than let you in
Cause knowing me I'd fall for you all over again

Cause the one I've got's tore up, it's twisted inside out
It wants me to dial your number when I'm 2 whiskeys down
With a little extra help, I think I could start clean
And I just might get over you getting over me

Cause the one I've got's tore up, it's twisted inside out
It wants me to dial your number when I'm 2 whiskeys down
With a little extra help, I think I could start clean
And I just might get over you getting over me

But God don't give you a spare one to see you through
Even if he did I'd give it away to you
Cause if I had another heart I'd let you break that one too.
Cause if I had another heart I'd let you break that one too.
