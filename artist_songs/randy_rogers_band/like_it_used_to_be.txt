Well, it's been a hard week chasin' down these miles
Tryin' desperately to find a reason to smile
It's been some time now, long overdue I know
Baby, put on your favorite dress, just let go

We'll go downtown, stop at the first bar we see
Yeah, we can throw 'em down
Oh baby, just you and me, we'll shoot the lights out
So no one else can see
Yeah, we'll close our eyes and wish it was like it used to be

Everyones fault

Who comes to your front door, those guys have got it all
All they want is more, I spent my last dime
See you smile tonight, tell me, what can I do
Get this right

If we go downtown, stop at the first bar we see
Yeah, we can throw 'em down
Oh baby, just you and me, we'll shoot the lights out
No one else can see
We'll close our eyes and wish it was like it used to be

Yeah, let's go downtown, stop at the first bar we see
Yeah, we can throw 'em down
Oh baby, just you and me, we'll shoot the lights out
No one else can see
Yeah, we'll close our eyes and wish it was like it used to be
We'll close our eyes and wish it was like it used to be
