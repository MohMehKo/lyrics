3 a.m. and I'm all alone, try to call but I doubt you're home
Not much has changed here on my end
Sure would be good to see you again, I know we had our fights
Nothing since has felt that right

Lived my life from day to day
If I don't think too much everything is okay

I miss holding your hand, miss going on walks, miss being your man
I miss watching you sleep, guess I just miss you with me

I still drive that same ol' car, still work at that run down bar
Still hang out with that same group of guys and on Saturday nights
Still go that dive been two months since I had a drink
Damn good for me, don't you think?

Oh, its been a year now since you've gone
Oh, I've tried my best, I can't move on

'Cause' I miss holding your hand, miss going on walks
Miss being your man, I miss watching you sleep
Guess I just miss you with me

If you give me a second chance, I'll never let you go
Swallowed all my pride and now I got a let you know

I miss holding your hand, miss going on walks, miss being your man
I miss watching you sleep, guess I just miss you
I guess I miss you with me
