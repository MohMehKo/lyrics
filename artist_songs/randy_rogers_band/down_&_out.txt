I've been down and I've been out 
I washed up when I thought I would drown 
I've been down and I've been out 
Never flown so high with both feet on the ground 

I've been walking in circles, all my life 
Chasing my own tail 
I've got a penny in my pocket but the rest of my change 
Is down at the bottom of the well 
I've got my mind made up but what I can't figure out 
Is how am I gonna leave my mark 
When all I've got left is doubt 

I've been down and I've been out 
I washed up when I thought I would drown 
I've been down and I've been out 
Never flown so high with both feet on the ground 

I've wasted my time all these years 
Just looking for a little bit more 
But it's hard to keep your shoes clean 
When all you've got is dirt on the floor 
And I've hit rock bottom with some good friends of mine 
We sat and watched the sun rise but we never saw it shine 

There's a man on the radio says he's got it all worked out 
He's got a show on the road but he don't know 
What it's all about 

I've been down and I've been out 
I washed up when I thought I would drown 
I've been down and I've been out 
Never flown so high with both feet on the ground
