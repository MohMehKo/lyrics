I poured out my heart to the one that I loved
She swore that she loved me and the lucky stars above
But they all came crashin' down just before dawn
And I woke up this mornin', like the wind, she was gone

So pour one for the pour one
Such a sad site to see
Pour one for the pour one
Poor pitiful me

I even poured out the bottle aq few years ago
She laid down the law, one of us had to go
I did everything she wanted but it wasn't enough
So when I was sleepin', she went and took all of her stuff

So pour one for the pour one
Such a sad site to see
Pour one for the pour one
Poor pitiful me

Stuck here like a stool that's been glued to a fool
While I drink, you pour, how 'bout one more

So pour one for the pour one
Such a sad site to see
Pour one for the pour one
Poor pitiful me
