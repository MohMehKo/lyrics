I got one foot on the gas, I got one foot in the grave*
I'm in the kind of trouble from which I can't be saved
I spend my night a runnin' or I'll spend my days in chains

This is my last last chance to get it right, right, right
So I won't have to hear my mamma cry, cry, cry
I stumble through the darkness just tryin' to find a light
This is my last last chance to get it right

I keep one hand on the Bible, I got one hand in the flame
I try to live the good life but it's all in vain
If I got to do it over, it would still turn out the same

This is my last last chance to get it right, right, right
So I won't have to hear my mamma cry, cry, cry
I stumble through the darkness just tryin' to find a light
This is my last last chance to get it right

Love of easy money, got me in the shape that I'm in
And the way that I've been living, I'll be right back here again

This is my last last chance to get it right, right, right
So I won't have to hear my mamma cry, cry, cry
I stumble through the darkness just tryin' to find a light
This is my last last chance to get it right

This is my last last chance to get it right
