An empty glass
A last cigarette
It's closin time
I'm drunk again
But somehow make it home
And cry myself to sleep
That's the way the day ends
Every night for me

Every night I'm in some bar
Pourin whiskey on a heart that's on fire
Forgettin you ain't no easy thing
Each night for me always ends the same

An empty glass
A last cigarette
It's closin time
I'm drunk again
But somehow make it home
And cry myself to sleep
That's the way the day ends
Every night for me

Every night I'm in some bar
Pourin whiskey on a heart that's on fire
Forgettin you ain't no easy thing
Each night for me always ends the same

An empty glass
A last cigarette
It's closin time
I'm drunk again
But somehow make it home
And cry myself to sleep
That's the way the day ends
Every night for me

That's the way the day ends
Every night for me
