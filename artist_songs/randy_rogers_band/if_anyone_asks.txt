If anyone asks I'm brokedown
Or maybe I'm just outta town
You can say I'm anywhere but where I am
If anyone asks don't lead em on
That anything is even wrong Do that if you can
cause no one needs to know 
we finally hit the end
You left the door wide open 
and I locked myself in

[Chorus]
Until I find a way to get my story straight 
Girl I never dreamed that I would see the day
That you were by my side and I would have to hide
cause there's nothing I could say
If anyone asks

If anyone asks I hold you tight 
Each and every night
For all they know you wont let go And I'm still there
If anyone asks don't say a thing
Just let that phone ring
If you answer now It wont be fair

cause no one needs to know
I gave you my best
You can tell them the truth
And make up the rest

[Chorus]

Well Ive been starin at myself
Tryin to catch my breath
The part that I cant figure out
Is all that I have left

[Chorus]
