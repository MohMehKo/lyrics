Mama look out yonder comin down the road
Well it looks to me to be half a mile or so
His guitar strapped across his back, it's everything he owns
Mama look out yonder comin down the road

Daddy always said he had the makings of a fool
He wouldn't listen to a word and he's broken every rule
But he had the good sense to turn around and come back home
And Mama look out yonder comin down the road

He's a winner, he's a loser, he's a picker, he's a chooser
He's a mover, he's a shaker, he's a giver, he's a taker
He has no use for silver cause his heart's as pure as gold
Mama look out yonder comin down the road

All he ever needed were the clothes upon his back
He never gave a tinkers damn and we'll damn sure give him that
He always chose the rows he hoed and he carried his own load
Mama look out yonder comin down the road

He's a winner, he's a loser, he's a picker, he's a chooser
He's a mover, he's a shaker, he's a giver, he's a taker
He has no use for silver cause his heart's as pure as gold
Mama look out yonder comin down the road
