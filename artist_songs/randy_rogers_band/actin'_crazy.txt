I barely found the time to write this letter
Both jobs have got me workin' all the time
Things are good here, they can always be better
Got another show tomorrow night

And all I know is the rent's as high as Willie
There's no snow and everybody's pretty
And the smoke makes everything seem hazy
And I ain't gettin' nowhere in this life actin' crazy

Just woke up on a park bench on Broadway
This Superman cape wrapped around my neck
Hey what I did last night was only krypyonite
Life is just one long, chaotic wreck

I've been told they serve liquor here for breakfast
And these folks make me proud to be from Texas
And I know this ain't how momma raised me
I ain't gettin' nowhere in this life actin' crazy

Everybody knows that you can't get high as Willie
And there is snow, that's why everybody's skinny
Gotta go, just been thinkin' about you lately
I ain't gettin' nowhere in this life actin' crazy
