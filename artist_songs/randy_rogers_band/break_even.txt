Well this is pretty low, it ain't the bottom
Still a long way to go, could I get you to follow
It all comes down to this just give me a reason
Cause I know I'll know I'll never win, we could break even

Cause I really don't care, I really don't care whose side I'm on 
Cause there is always room at the bottom once the line's been drawn 
And I know I'll never win, just let me go on believing 
But there is still a chance that we could break even 

Well this is gonna hurt, I can ease your pain 
Cause once you've felt the fire you don't mind the rain
If you go down, down, down out in the deep end 
Could you pull me up just enough to break even 

Cause I really don't care, I really don't care whose side I'm on 
Cause there is always room at the bottom once the line's been drawn 
And I know I'll never win, just let me go on believing 
But there is still a chance that we could break even 

There's still a chance, still a chance she could save me
There's still a chance I'll just bring you down

Cause I really don't care, I really don't care whose side I'm on 
Cause there is always room at the bottom once the line's been drawn 
And I know I'll never win, just let me go on believing 
But there is still a chance that we could break even 
There is still a chance that we could break even

Yeah
