Well the time has come for me to go and leave you far behind
Don't you worry none, it's just for a short time
Well some time apart will do us good, we'll find out who we are
Hopefully, we'll find ourselves back in each others arms

But I'm leavin on a jet plane
Yeah I'll be out of sight
Those silver wings are gonna carry me
Off into the moonlight
So please don't forget me, when I have gone
Cause all I've ever wanted is for my songs to live on

Well I like the way you're always there to stand up by my side
Through your swingin doors is a place that I can hide
Well I hope you know just how much you really mean to me
Without you, I have no clue just who I would be

But I'm leavin on a jet plane
Yeah I'll be out of sight
Those silver wings are gonna carry me
Off into the moonlight
So please don't forget me, when I have gone
Cause all I've ever wanted is for my songs to live on

But I'm leavin on a jet plane
Yeah I'll be out of sight
Those silver wings are gonna carry me
Off into the moonlight
So please don't forget me, when I have gone
Cause all I've ever wanted is for my songs to live on

So please don't forget me when I have gone
Cause all I've ever wanted is for my songs to live on
