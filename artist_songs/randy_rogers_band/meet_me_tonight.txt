Meet me tonight in a memory somewhere back in time
That old dive just south of Santa Fe when you used to look at me that way
Come on baby meet me tonight at our old apartment off of church and main
Things are different now but it ain't changed I drove by there just the other day
I’m so tired of trying to be strong I just wanna miss you all night long

So baby whatcha say one time for old times sake
You know my heart’s still yours to break

So come on baby meet me tonight in this bottle of your favorite wine
Kill me slowly like these cigarettes I ain't found a way to quit you yet
I’m so tired of trying to be strong I just wanna miss you all night long

So baby whatcha say one time for old times sake
You know my heart’s still yours to break
So come on baby meet me tonight

I’m so tired of trying to be strong I just wanna miss you all night long

So baby whatcha say one time for old times sake
You know my heart’s still yours to break

So come on baby meet me tonight
Come on baby meet me tonight
Come on baby meet me tonight
Meet me tonight
