Say goodbye to your old friends and wish them well
The summer sun has set for the last time but you don't mind
It won't be easy and you can tell it hurts like hell
But there's a brand new world
Somewhere else

You gotta run like you've never run before
Up ahead there is so much more
Than the life you left behind
You gotta go, throw caution to the wind
You'll never get this chance again
You'll find a new place to hide
Starting over for the last time

A burning box of memories I can't put out
It just seemed easier to me, to let it be
One more night in this old house and there's no doubt
That before too long
I'll be gone, gone, gone

You gotta run like you've never run before
Up ahead there is so much more
Than the life you left behind
You gotta go, throw caution to the wind
You'll never get this chance again
You'll find a new place to hide
Starting over for the last time

Over and over again
A brand new start
Well, I'm gonna try to forget
Where you are

You gotta run like you've never run before
Up ahead there is so much more
Than the life you left behind
You gotta go, throw caution to the wind
You'll never get this chance again
You'll find a new place to hide
Starting over for the last time

Starting over for the last time
Starting over for the last time
Starting over for the last time
