This is your love song baby 
This is the part where I must confess 
You're looking good in that dress 

Consider this fair warning 
It's getting kinda hard to say goodnight 
Underneath the porch light 

Now I'm not saying it sink or swim 
But I've already jumped in 

Cause tonight's not the night 
To play it safe or take it easy 
Or waste anymore precious time 
No tonight's not the night 
To watch you get in your car and leave me 
No tonight's not the night for goodbye 

Sometimes it's not easy 
Sometimes love can scare you half to death 
But I'll give it my best 
Yeah we'll find a way to make it 
Who says we've got to do it their way 
Baby what do you say? 

Cause tonight's not the night 
To play it safe or take it easy 
Or waste anymore precious time 
No tonight's not the night 
To watch you get in your car and leave me 
No tonight's not the night for goodbye 

It's a long way home 
Yeah you got no reason to go 
Why don't you stay, stay
