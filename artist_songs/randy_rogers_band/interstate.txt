Open suitcase, clothes scattered on the floor
I don't take the time to unpack anymore
I'm making sure that i take this all in
Before you know it I'll be off again

So what should we do?
One more day with you

We don't have to go anywhere,
We don't have to try something new,
Girl I really don't care
As long as I'm with you
Baby lets just take a drive
It's already getting late
Let's go kiss the sundown,
Out on the interstate.

Lets drive through town, down to the lake
We'll beg the moon to take its time stealing the day
Just let me hold you, til the stars fill the sky
And one by one I'll watch them dance into your eyes

Oh we'll take it slow,
Baby don't you know

We don't have to go anywhere,
We don't have to try something new,
Girl I really don't care
As long as I'm with you
Baby lets just take a drive
It's already getting late
Let's go kiss the sundown,
Out on the interstate.

Let's not waste our time
Worrying about goodbye
Baby just close your eyes
And stay right here

We don't have to go anywhere,
We don't have to try something new,
Girl I really don't care
As long as I'm with you
Baby lets just take a drive
It's already getting late
Let's go kiss the sundown,
Out on the interstate.
