Well here we are again, just like last Tuesday night
Getting Drunk, being too loud and looking for another fight
Skipped class, sat out on the porch, watched the girls go by
Beer ran out, somebody go to the store, cause I'm too drunk to drive 

[Chorus:]
Sing me a song about the way things used to be
Back in 76' when this was the place to be
Float the river go to old Gruene Hall and drink that Lone Star Beer
We'll find our way down to Cheatham St. that's why we're all here

Well we never run out of little things that we can do for fun
Like drive out to five mile just to catch some sun
We always have Mexico, it's just a few hours away
Or road trip out to Luckenbach, to hear old Bob Keen Play

[Repeat Chorus]
Sing me a song about the way things used to be
Back in 76' when this was the place to be
Float the river go to old Gruene Hall and drink that Lone Star Beer
We'll find our way down to Cheatham St. that's why we're all here
