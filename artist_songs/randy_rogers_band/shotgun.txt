[Verse 1:]
Once I was a gamblin' man
I kept my pistol by my hand
Got my work done by the light of the moon
Evil deeds made up my mind
I traded peace for troubled times
Wickedness and whiskey were my fuel
Oh but now I keep it locked away...

[Chorus:]
I might have hung up my shotgun
But i didn't put it up so high
That I can't reach up and get it back down
If you give me a reason why
Still got a few shells itchin' to see the light of day
A couple of rounds of buckshot will go a long long way
Once I had a good run
But I hung up my shotgun

[Verse 2:]
No one lives that life too long
Just in time somebody can along
With her help I just might save my soul
Sometimes I wake up at night
From dreams of fire burning bright
I pray that I don't ever lose control
And so now ле keep it locked away...

[Chorus:]
I might have hung up my shotgun
But I didn't put it up so high
That I can't reach up and get it back down
If you give me a reason why
Still got a few shells itchin' to see the light of day
A couple of rounds of buckshot will go a long long way
Once I had a good run
But I hung up my shotgun.

[Chorus:]
I might have hung up my shotgun
But I didn't put it up so high
That I can't reach up and get it back down
If you give me a reason why
Still got a few shells itchin' to see the light of day
A couple of rounds of buckshot will go a long long way
Once I had a good run
But I hung up my shotgun.
Yeah I hung up my shotgun
