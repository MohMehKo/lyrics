Got a call from my cousin
Come and get me right now
'Cause I done lost my woman
And I need a night out

Said I can't burn it down
'Cause I'm getting up early
I'm down for one round
But around 1:30
I was sitting at a Waffle House
I think I had grits
Started hitting on a waitress
Everything after that gets fuzzy

Like a TV in a cheap motel
My head feels funny
I lost my keys
I lost my cell
And all of my money

Did I crash a party,
Have a run in with the law,
Take a swim in a fountain?
I don't know
'Cause it's all kinda fuzzy

There's a ring on my finger
There's a bra on the lamp
Gotta get outta this hot tub
And try to find my pants

Who the hell is Heather?
And when were we together?
'Cause I've got every letter of her name on my chest
Think I got a shiner
And a cigarette burn
Nothing in that bottle of tequila but the worm

It's fuzzy
Like static on the radio
My head feels funny
I lost my watch
I lost my clothes
And all of my money

Did I call my mamma,
Try to break into the mall?
Did I even pay the cabby?
I don't know
'Cause it's all kinda fuzzy

I remember how it started
After that it's just a blur
Is it a Sunday or a Monday?
Am I suppose to be at work?

It's fuzzy
Like a tennis ball on my tongue
My mouth feels funny
I'm blinded by the sun
But things ain't sunny

Will the room stop spinning?
Will I find my car
On my way back home right now?
It's all fuzzy
(fuzzy)

Oh
It's fuzzy
(fuzzy)
It's fuzzy
Everything is fuzzy
