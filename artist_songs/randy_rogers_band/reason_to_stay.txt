You look pretty good, for all that you've seen
You're smiles still as bright as its ever been
You wont show your eye, scared that they might
Show all the world what you told me last night

And you're so tired of just being alive
You're so sad you could just cry
I'd sing you the sweetest songs, and hold you so long.
And make you forget all the reasons
you talked about leaving this place
If you're thinking about leaving
I could give you a reason to stay

You seem pretty calm, for what you have done
Your always rehursted, you impress everyone
You cover so well, that no one can tell
Your skin is on fire, and your heart is in hell

And you're so tired of just being alive
You're so sad you could just cry
I'd sing you the sweetest songs, and hold you so long.
And make you forget all the reasons
you talked about leaving this place
If you're thinking about leaving
I could give you a reason to stay

If you got to go, then you oughta know
I wont stand in your way. Just give me time
I'll change you mind
Soon you'll forget yesterday

I'd sing you the sweetest songs, and hold you so long.
And make you forget all the reasons
you talked about leaving this place
If you're thinking about leaving
I could give you a reason to stay

A reason to stay, wont you stay with me tonight.
A reason to stay. Wont you stay with me one more time.
