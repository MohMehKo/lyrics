Everybody get your ticket, it's almost time
To set up this freak show, watch me unwind
For the next ninety minutes we'll be having the time of our lives

I might sing something pretty if I'm feeling loved 
I might kick out the footlights if I drink too much
I'll give it all that I have hoping this time it might be enough

Till they pack up my guitars and unplug my star

Oh a ringmaster's night gets lonely after the big top comes down
Yeah cause I go from being somebody to just another clown
When the circus leaves town

Well it's cold, dark, and empty back in my cage
And it's all wasted hours till I'm back on stage
And it's scary sometimes what I will do to pass them away

You learn to live for the lights when they're keeping you alive

Oh a ringmaster's night gets lonely after the big top comes down
Yeah cause I go from being somebody to just another clown
When the circus leaves town

Oh a ringmaster's night gets lonely after the big top comes down
Yeah and I go from being somebody to just another clown
When the circus leaves town
When the circus leaves town
Yeah
