You look so out of place with these shades of neon on your face
It's not like you hidin' here
You're shadow on these smoky walls don't look good on you at all
No more than those damn midnight tears

I can see her, tequila in your eyes, makes me want to run, run, run
Save me from a pain they can't disguise, before you come undone
Cause they can't hide the truth and I am tryin to 
I see right through those tequila eyes

I noticed when I first walked in that stool beside you needs a friend
Looks like you could use one, too
Girl, the trouble with the past is you can't kill it with a shot glass
Once it catches up with you

I can see her, tequila in your eyes, makes me want to run, run, run
Save me from a pain they can't disguise, before you come undone
Cause they can't hide the truth and I am tryin to 
I see right through those tequila eyes

It's either had too much or haven't had enough

And They can't hide the truth for dyin', tryin to 
I see right through those tequila eyes
Oh I see right through those tequila eyes

Those tequila eyes
Those tequila eyes
Those tequila eyes
