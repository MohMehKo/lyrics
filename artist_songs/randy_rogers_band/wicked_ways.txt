Long ago I was not weary
Once I thought that I could see the light
But now I'm shut out in the darkness
Won't you help me make it through this night

And I know that you've seen trouble
I know that you have been blue
But I'd give my last dollar
To see you walk a mile in my shoes

Wicked ways have taken me, broken me apart
Rotten seed that I have sewn has overgrown my heart
But I think that you could save me if you care to spend the time
Just hope you leave your wicked ways behind with mine

Put down my glass to remember
Raise it up when I want to forget
Just when I think I've hit the bottom
I find out that I have not started yet

Wicked ways have taken me, broken me apart
Rotten seed that I have sewn has overgrown my heart
But I think that you could save me if you care to spend the time
Just hope you leave your wicked ways behind with mine

So stop don't point that finger
Turn around and take a look inside
And if you find you are without folly
Walk along and play this song of mine

Wicked ways have taken me, broken me apart
Rotten seed that I have sewn has overgrown my heart
But I think that you could save me if you care to spend the time

Just hope you leave your wicked ways behind with mine
