The wolf is always knocking
Behind your back somebody's talking
Yeah the sun always sets at the end of the day 
Nobody wins every game they play

Your lucky stars already taken 
And every close call leaves you shaken 
Don't be afraid if you have to fold 
Just count your blessings and hit the road 

Let it go, let it ride
You couldn't fix it if you tried
It's a whole lot worse holding it all inside 
Let it go, set it free
There are some things you aren't supposed to keep
Don't go crazy over what you can't control
Let it go

When it's fixed but it still feels broken
And your favorite guitar gets stolen
When your back's up against the wall 
And every step you take you fall

Let it go, let it ride
You couldn't fix it if you tried
It's a whole lot worse holding it all inside 
Let it go, set it free
There are some things you aren't supposed to keep
Don't go crazy over what you can't control
Let it go

Everything happens for a reason 
And you ain't gonna stop it
If you build your own prison
Only you have a key to unlock it

Let it go, let it ride
You couldn't fix it if you tried
It's a whole lot worse holding it all inside 
Let it go, set it free
There are somethings you aren't supposed to keep
Don't go crazy over what you can't control
Let it go
