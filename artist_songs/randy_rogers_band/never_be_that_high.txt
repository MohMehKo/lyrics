A hand-me-down hot rod holding down the interstate
Life in the fast lane staying out too late
Drunk on summertime
Crazy and hard to hold

A car full of dreamers parked in the parking lot 
Waiting on the world and some girls was a long shot 
Life was drug and we were hooked 
We didn't know

We'll never be that high again
Stoned out our minds on innocence
Used to catch a buzz on the fact that it was Saturday night
We'll never be that high again
Tell me why did it have to end
You're only young once but man you're not too old to try
But you know you'll never be that high

I'll always remember when I met Jim Bean
Everybody laughed pretty hard at the first drink
Barely got it down thought I'd drowned when it took a hold

It hit me like a train to the brain feeling real tall
Twenty minutes later Jim hit me like a brick wall
Never felt as good as the first time that whiskey flowed

We'll never be that high again
Stoned out our minds on innocence
Used to catch a buzz on the fact that it was Saturday night
We'll never be that high again
Tell me why did it have to end
You're only young once but man you're not too old to try
But you know you'll never be that high

She kissed me in the back seat first time show me how 
Knocked me off my feet wish I had that feeling now

I'll never be that high again
Stoned out my minds on innocence
Used to catch a buzz on the fact that it was Saturday night
I'll never be that high again
Tell me why did it have to end
You're only young once but man you're not too old to try
But you know you'll never be that
