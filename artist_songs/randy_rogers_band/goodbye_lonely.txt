[Verse 1:]
They say love is hard to find
Like its something we decide
Just found out love found you
You walked in and caught my eye
I felt something come alive
Like every dream I'd ever had just came true

[Chorus:]
It's like waking up after you've been sleeping
Finally found you something you believe in
Live the rest of my life for you only
It's no more lonely goodbye
It's goodbye lonely

[Verse 2:]
You've got my soul singing songs
It's been quiet now for so long
My heart is beating just like a drum
And for so many years I thought you'd never come

[Chorus:]
It's like waking up after you've been sleeping
Finally found you something you believe in
Live the rest of my life for you only
It's no more lonely goodbye
It's goodbye lonely

All of a sudden the sun is shining
All of the stars decided to align and
There you were it looks like love had perfect timing

[Chorus:]
Its like waking up after you've been sleeping
Finally found you something you believe in
Live the rest of my life for you only
It's no more tears in my eyes
No more lonely goodbyes
Its goodbye Lonely
