Running round, chasin what I can't find
You were here, before you left me far behind
Are you scared, to give yourself another chance
Or will you run away, cause you're too scared to dance

Here I am, a man, getting older every day
There you go again, slipping further and further away
If you tell me, things went wrong
Maybe I'll find out where you and I belong

When you need me, I'm always around
When I'm all alone, you're nowhere to be found
Could you tell me, what you're gonna do
That day that you wake up, and I've forgotten about you

Here I am, a man, getting older every day
There you go again, slipping further and further away
If you tell me, things went wrong
Maybe I'll find out where you and I belong

Here I am, a man, getting older every day
There you go again, slipping further and further away
If you tell me, things went wrong
Maybe I'll find out where you and I belong

Maybe I'll find out where you and I belong
