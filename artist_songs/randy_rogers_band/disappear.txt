You only want what you can't have,
And that's all there is to you
You've got your head in the clouds,
And your heart is bulletproof

You've got everything you want,
Yeah but you don't care
Because you never do, until they disappear

I've tried my best,
I can't try anymore
It's no use,
You've got a lock on your door

You'd be wise, to realize
That what I've got is real,
Yeah but you're too busy burning bridges
To know how you feel

You only want what you can't have,
And that's all there is to you
You've got your head in the clouds,
And your heart is bulletproof

You've got everything you want,
Yeah but you don't care
Because you never do, until they disappear

I see you talking to him
Just like you do everyone,
Well he's gettin lost
But for you its just fun

The way you mesmerize,
with those blue eyes
And long, curly hair
The way you say my name
When you play those games,
tell me how can this be fair

You only want what you can't have,
And that's all there is to you
You've got your head in the clouds,
And your heart is bulletproof

You've got everything you want,
Yeah but you don't care
Because you never do, until they disappear

You only want what you can't have,
And that's all there is to you
You've got your head in the clouds,
And your heart is bulletproof

You've got everything you want,
Yeah but you don't care
Because you never do, until they disappear

Yeah we never do, until they disappear.
