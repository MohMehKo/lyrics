It's funny how some people dream 
They put on a show just to be on the scene 
I don't know how many times I've stood right here 
And you still don't see me 
It may be wrong but tonight I'm gonna see those city lights 
Cause it sure as hell beats lying here 
Wishing I was on your mind 

So tonight I'm walking and you started talking 
About what you said we would never be 
Oh and I've been worried it's the same old story I never know if you're gonna leave 
I say it's the last time, just like I always do 
I give you another chance and I lay it all on you 

I caught myself out drifting 
I guess sometimes it's good to be alone 
Like a lonely gypsy I've got nothing to prove 
And no one to call my own 
I know there are people watching 
Waiting for my next move 
Yeah but they can't see that I'm too busy 
Waiting on me and you 

So tonight I'm walking and you started talking 
About what you said we would never be 
Oh and I've been worried it's the same old story I never know if you're gonna leave 
I say it's the last time, just like I always do 
I give you another chance and I lay it all on you
