Another day just rolling by in the same old town.  
Another drink at the local bar, hear the same old sound. 
That juke box singing solid country gold. 
I was just gonna pay my tab roll on home.

Outa nowhere you come walkin in.
Without warning I'm wondering where you been
All my life how did I find a woman like you just in time 
Ohhhhh, here comes love like a flash flood

Now girl you're living proof what people say. 
What you don't know you're looking for is sure to come your way.
And I've been sitting here knowing there is something missing inside. 
Now standing right in front of me looking me in the eyes.

Outa nowhere you come walkin in.
Without warning I'm wondering where you been
All my life how did I find a woman like you just in time 
Ohhhhh, here comes love like a flash flood

Outa nowhere  you come walkin in.
Without warning  I'm wondering where you been
All my life how did I find a woman like you just in time 
Ohhhhh, here comes love    
Ohhhhh, here comes love like a flash flood
