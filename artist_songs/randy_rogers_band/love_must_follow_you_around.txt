I don't wanna go to sleep tonight 
Cause in the morning I'll be leaving 
We can sit and talk with the candle light 
And even though I know it's coming, it will hit me without warning 

Love must follow you around, cause everytime we're close 
It comes creepin in, deeper than I have ever known 
And I don't know if you know it, but it's catching up with me 
It's gonna track you down 
Baby love must follow you around 

I've been running with my heart wide open 
I know I'm not always what you need 
But I'll pick up the pieces that I've broken 
When I get home, from this highwat then you'll see 

Love must follow you around, cause everytime we're close 
It comes creepin in, deeper than I have ever know 
And I don't know if you know it, but it's cathing up with me 
It's gonna track you down 
Baby love must follow you around
