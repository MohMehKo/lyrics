Does everybody know that I'm to blame
None of you friend up in Fort Worth even know my name
But even if I tried, well if I tried to be true
If I'd walk a line, I'd still be losin you

Tell me what you think I should do
Cause I just cant understand you
I'm about to speak my mind
Even if its a waste a time

Everybody knows that I'm to blame
none of your friends even know my name
Even if I tried to be true
If I'd walk a line, I'd still be losing you

Now you act like you still care
Even though you know its not fair
You still call me on the telephone
Only when you're all alone

Everybody knows that I'm to blame
none of your friends even know my name
Even if I tried to be true
If I'd walk a line, I'd still be losing you

We both know we let a good thing go to waste
My bags a packed now, I'll be on my way (adios)

Everybody knows that I'm to blame
none of your friends even know my first name
Even if I tried to be true
If I'd walk a line,

Everybody knows that I'm to blame
none of your friends even know my dogs name
Even if I tried to be true
If I'd walk a line, I'd still be losing you
If I'd walk a line, I'd still be losing you
