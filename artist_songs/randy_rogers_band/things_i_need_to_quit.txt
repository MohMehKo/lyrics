Ashtray full of Marlboro reds
Empty fifth layin' on the bed
A hangover hangin' on in my head
Along with the damn goodbye you said

Got some habits I need to kick
You're at the top of my list
Of things I need to quit

There's a girl gettin' dressed, cab on the way
Don't know her number, don't know her name
She looks a lot like you, ain't that a shame
Girl I'm all messed up and you're to blame

Got some habits I need to kick
You're at the top of my list
Of things I need to quit

Everything about you is bad for me
Damn you and damn your memory
Can't keep going on like this
Something's gotta break, something's gotta give
Wish I could say to hell with it all
Instead of hanging 'round hoping you might call

I keep that song stuck on repeat
Something 'bout the words and melody
Takes me back to the way it used to be
Even with you gone you get the best of me

I got some habits I need to kick
You're at the top of my list
Of things I need to quit

No, I wouldn't be stoned like this
If I could get you off of my list
Of things I need to quit

Things I need to quit
