We sat and talked last night like it had been a year
The whole time I wondered if you were even here
The things left unsaid could have filled a book
Its funny how you capture me with just one little look

[Chorus:]
I just wanna be your Superman
Save you everyday
But I can't be too familiar anymore
Well I guess it's time for me to walk away

It was late in the evening when you stopped by
I could tell you were changed by the look in your eye
I tried so hard to say the right thing
But if I'm loosing you, then there's only me left to blame

[Chorus:]
I just wanna be your Superman
Save you everyday
But I can't be too familiar anymore
Well I guess it's time for me to walk away

Well I know you'll be a shining star
In someone else's sky
I remember all the times, I held on to you girl
And kept the dreams alive

[Chorus:]
I just wanna be your Superman
And save you everyday, every single day
Well I can't be too familiar anymore
Well I guess it's time for me to walk away
Don't you walk away from me now
Please don't walk away from me oh no
