[Verse 1:]
God I hate this little town
It's like you fall in love and you can't get out
Cus when I think I've set you down
Somebody opens up their mouth

[Chorus:]
Speak of the devil here I go again
Right back there and what could of been
Say your name like your just some friend
Asking if I've heard from you
And I just smile as Im fallin apart
Got a real good memory and a hair trigger heart
one little spark and I'm goin through hell again
Speak of the devil
Speak of the devil

[Verse 2:]
I know you didn't mean to hurt me like this
Didn't mean you'd kill me with a goodbye kiss
It's like they didn't even play this song on the radio, can't believe it just came on
I was trying to catch up with a few old friends, and there it is

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I came in here to drink
Drown you out, watch you sink
To do anything but think
Speak of the devil
Speak of the devil
Speak of the devil
Speak of the devil here I go again
Here I go again
