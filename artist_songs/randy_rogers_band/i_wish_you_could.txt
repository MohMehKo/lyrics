When they call your name
will you walk right off
with a smile on your face?

Will you coward in fear
in your favorite sweater
with an old love letter?

I wish you would
I wish you would
come pick me up, take me out, fuck me up, steal my records,
skrew all my friends, they're all full of shit
with a smile on your face
and you'd do it again
I wish you would

When your walking downtown
do you wish I was there?
Do you wish it was me?

With the windows clear
and the manakins eyes
do they all look like mine?

I hope you could
I wish you would
come pick me up, take me out, fuck me up, steal my records,
skrew all my friends, behind my back
with a smile on your face
and you'd do it again
I wish you would

I wish you'd make up my bed
so I can make up my mind
Try and sleep in it instead
Maybe you'll rest sometime
I wish you would
I wish you could
