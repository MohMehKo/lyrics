Same old bedroom floor 
Some old empty sheets 
I hate this haunted bed 
So down here is where I sleep 

I tried to find a place 
To hide what you had left 
Somethings never change 
My heart hasn't yet 

I don't wanna go out tonight 
Yeah but I can't be alone 
Standing underneath this broke street light 
Can somebody take me home 
Somebody take me home 

The hope that we had left 
I wrapped around your ring 
That river just rolled on by 
When I watched it sink 

I don't wanna go out tonight 
Yeah but I can't be alone 
Standing underneath this broke street light 
Can somebody take me home 
Somebody take me home 

Out of this bar, out of this heartache 
Out of this world, I just keep breaking down 
I keep breaking down 

I don't wanna go out tonight 
Yeah but I can't be alone 
Standing underneath this broke street light 
Can somebody take me home 
Somebody take me home
