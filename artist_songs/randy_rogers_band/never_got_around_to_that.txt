I stood in the doorway and watched
How she drove out of sight
She was what you call gone long before
There were tears in her eyes
And I thought about begging her please
It crossed my mind to hit my knees

But I never got around to that
Something inside me kept holdin' me back,
I knew what to say before she drove away
But for the life of me why didn't I ask,
I never got around to that.

Last night I saw her in the arms
Of somebody new
It almost killed me, cause he did
What I couldn't do
And it seems like it was yesterday
There I stood four words away

But I never got around to that
Something inside me kept holdin' me back,
I knew what to say before she drove away
But for the life of me why didn't I ask,
I never got around...

But I never got around to that
Something inside me kept holdin' me back,
I knew what to say before she drove away
But for the life of me why didn't I ask,
I never got around to that.
