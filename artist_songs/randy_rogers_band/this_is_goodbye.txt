Well this is goodbye, the end of you and me
We've set this boat ablaze and pushed it out to sea
And nothing that's on board will survive
This is goodbye

Well this is goodbye, not the kind we've had before
We're out of one more tries, there won't be anymore
And all the grays have turned to black and white
This is goodbye

This is hard, this is hell
This is pain like I have never felt
This is final, love has failed 
This is walking away from us to save ourselves
This is goodbye

Well this is goodbye, in my heart there's no doubt
Cause I can feel the broken pieces trying to cut their way out 
Some of them I know I'll never find 
This is goodbye

This is hard, this is hell
This is pain like I have never felt
This is final, love has failed 
This is walking away from us to save ourselves
This is goodbye
This is final, love has failed 
This is walking away from us to save ourselves
This is goodbye
