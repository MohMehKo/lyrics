This highway's sure been good to me
White lines as far as you can see
There's a girl from down around Poteet
Wants to meet me down on Frio Street

San Antone, San Antone
I been gone for way too long
But you gotta go-o-o-o-o when you gotta go 
Like Crockett at the Alamo 
Ya'll can find me down in San Antone

Where I come from, those cowboys know
Just how to roll right with the flow
Shiner Bock and dominoes
And Reckless on the radio

San Antone, San Antone
I been gone for way too long
But you gotta go-o-o-o-o when you gotta go 
Like Crockett at the Alamo 
Ya'll can find me down in San Antone

Once I reach that Frio Street
Gonna kiss the ground beneath my feet
Then find a band with a fiddle man
And dance to every song I can

San Antone, San Antone
I been gone for way too long
But you gotta go-o-o-o-o when you gotta go 
Like Crockett at the Alamo 
Ya'll can find me down in San Antone

Someday when you lay me low
Like Crockett at the Alamo 
Lay me down in San Antone
