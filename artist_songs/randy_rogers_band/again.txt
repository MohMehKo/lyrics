On the floor now, on the floor now
Well it's started again, yeah it's started again

Close the door now, close the door now
Won't you let me in? Why won't you let me in?

Cause it's been six long days and I'm on my way
Will I ever see the end?
I've got a heavy load down a dead end road
And I can't sleep again, no I can't sleep again

Hold the phone now, hold the phone now
You're calling again, why won't you call again?

Say my name little girl, say my name little girl
Even though it's a sin, yeah you know it's a sin

Cause it's been six long days and I'm on my way
Will I ever see the end?
I've got a heavy load down a dead end road
And I can't sleep again, no I can't sleep again

I've gotta roll on
Gotta leave you alone
Yeah but baby not for long

Cause it's been six long days and I'm on my way
Will I ever see the end?
I've got a heavy load down a dead end road
And I can't sleep again, no I can't sleep again
