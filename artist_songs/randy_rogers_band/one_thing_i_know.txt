Woke up today and things have changed
The man I've become just ain't the same
Wanted to run but there's just no where to go
livin in a dreamworld, praying that it don't show.

Cause who I am
Is who you want me to be
But I'm havin a hard time findin me
So take my hand darling
wont you let me go
got to do this by myself
thats one thing I know

livin my life on low fuel
tellin myself that I'm a damn fool
all of my friends up in Fort Worth tell me how I'm brave
little do you know I almost lost you yesterday

Cause who I am
Is who you want me to be
But I'm havin a hard time findin me
So take my hand darling
wont you let me go
got to do this by myself
thats one thing I know

I got the demons on my trail
Crazy and messed up
no one else can tell

Cause who I am
Is who you want me to be
But I'm havin a hard time findin me
So take my hand darling
wont you let me go
got to do this by myself
thats one thing I know

gotta do this all alone thats one think I know
