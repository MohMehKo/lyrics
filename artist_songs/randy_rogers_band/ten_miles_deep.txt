When I'm dead, put me ten miles deep
Hand me up my shotgun Maggie made
The Devil's come to take your boy away
I've been spotted on the run
I'll be waitin when they come
Hand me up my shotgun Maggie made

I was born a poor man's only son
It ain't my fault I grew up on the run
I did my time as a working man
Fate kept blood stains on my hand
I was born a poor man's only son

[Chorus:]
When I'm dead, put me ten miles deep
When I'm dead, put me ten miles deep
Said brother when you lay me down
Down beneath the cold hard ground
You better put me ten miles deep

I keep my pistol by my head at night
Lordy I can't seen to do no right
My hometown, they know my name
Killed the man and won I my fame
Keep my pistol by my head at night

When I'm dead just put me ten miles deep
When Jesus comes he won't disturb my sleep
I knew it when they shot me down
Felt the flames from underground
When I'm dead just put me ten miles deep

[Chorus:]
When I'm dead, put me ten miles deep
When I'm dead, put me ten miles deep
Said brother when you lay me down
Down beneath the cold hard ground
You better put me ten miles deep

Said brother when you lay me down
Down beneath the cold hard ground
You better put me ten miles deep
