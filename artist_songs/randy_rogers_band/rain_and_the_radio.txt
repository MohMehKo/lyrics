Storms Rollin' in 
Power lines are down 
They don't know when
It's gonna come back on 
I hope it takes all night long 

Pour a glass of wine 
Chase it with a kiss 
Come a little closer
As long as we're stuck like this
Tonight

Who needs the lights 
Girl were doin' just fine
Stumblin' in the shadows
Rollin in the candle glow 
We ain't got nowhere to go 
Two lovers on a mission 
Dancin to the rhythm of
The rain and the radio

Somethin tells me
It won't be long
But let's keep them off
Even if they cut back on
Tonight 

Who needs the lights 
Girl were doin' just fine
Stumblin' in the shadows
Rollin in the candle glow 
We ain't got nowhere to go 
Two lovers on a mission 
Dancin to the rhythm of
The rain and the radio

Now baby this house is haunted 
With a burning desire 
And we'll wake up tomorrow mornin
Like ashes from the fire

Who needs the lights 
Girl were doin' just fine
Stumblin' in the shadows
Rollin in the candle glow 
We ain't got nowhere to go 
Two lovers on a mission 
Dancin to the rhythm of
The rain and the radio [x2]
