I saw you again last night
I caught you catchin my eye, I love to stare at you
Thru the smoke & lights
Well I can see that I 
See that I just wanna hold you, I just wanna know you
I just wanna spend the night wrapped up in you

[Chorus 1:]
But its all, its all 
Just a matter of time
Its all
Its all just a matter of time

Don't care how long this takes
Cause baby I cant wait, can't wait for you
To hold me, to know me
I just wanna spend the night wrapped up in you

[Chorus 2:]
But its all, its all 
Just a matter of time
But Its all
Its all just a matter of time

Gonna wake up and find
Its just a matter of time until you are mine

[Chorus 2]

Its all, its all just a matter of time

[Outro]
