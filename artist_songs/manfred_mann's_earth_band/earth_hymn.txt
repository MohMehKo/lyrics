Listen all around
Symphony of sound will take you
Drifting down through your dreams
In an endless stream

Singing through the air
On its wings of fiery silence
The melody comes crystal clear
Can you hear it near

Song of all the earth
Song of death and birth
Ringing through sea and sky
Can you hear the cry?
