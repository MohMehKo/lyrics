Gonna build us a fire
It's gonna light up the sea
Burn all the bridges down
Set the people free
Burn the poison from the pain
Evil from the man

We're gonna scatter the ashes to the wind

Gonna build us a fire
It's gonna light up the blue
Burn all the cages down
Let the people through
Burn the poison from the fruit
Evil from the root

We're gonna scatter the ashes to the wind
