Crisis in the night
No lighting in the ballroom
Voices come and go
Talking Michaelangelo
Down in the forest
The insect Kindom gathers
Pictures getting restles
Trouble in the Night.

Waiting for the moonsoon
No lighting in the ballroom. (repeat)

Finger in the sky
They're jamming all the airwaves
Searching for the traitor
That blew the generator
Oh,Mother - couldn't find a candle
Man, this station's justo to hot to ....(hanlde)
Waiting for the moonson
No lighting in the ballroom
Blood flecked voices
Distortion and gain
Static interference, short wave rain
And there's not repetition of signal chime
(But the) feeble reception
Couldn't get the meantime.
Waiting for the moonson
No lighting in the ballroom
Waiting for the moonson
No lighting in the ballroom
