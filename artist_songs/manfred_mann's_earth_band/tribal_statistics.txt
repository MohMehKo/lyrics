Who are you ?
Give details
Everywhere you look now, questionnaires
They want every detail of your affairs
Oh, so many people lives
Wrapped up in those...
Statistics, statistics - figures in a page
Statistics, statistics - numbers on a tape

You're in their sight
Yes, they classify you
Shades of black and white
Oh, so many people lives
Wrapped up in those...

And putting things right
These people rule with facts in the night
Oh, so many people lives
Wrapped up in those...
