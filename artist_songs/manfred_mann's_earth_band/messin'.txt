Right now the world ain't looking too hot
Unless you're dead you must know what I mean
There's a ...
They say they've got an answer but I think it's all a dream

Well it's easy to forget about it, just get high
Live up in your castle in the sky
But you still breathe in the same air as me
Eating, drinking, poisoning where it should be

We're messin' up the land
We're messin' up the sea
We're messin' up the air
Messin' up on you and me
[repeat]

Things are worse than going wrong
Here we still go rushing proudly on
Take a look around, like around you everywhere
This must be the age, the age of I don't care

Right now the world ain't looking too hot
Unless you're dead you must know what I mean
You can read it in the papers, hear it on the news
The earth is going down, going down in pollution blues

We're messin' up the land
We're messin' up the sea
We're messin' up the air
Messin' up on you and me
[repeat]
