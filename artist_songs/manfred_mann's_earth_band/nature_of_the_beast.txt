It's the nature of the beast
To satisfy his every appetite
He doesn't worry 'bout the cost
He doesn't worry if it's wrong or right
There's no method to his madness
Just watch him step up to the firing line
And it's all a game
It doesn't matter who plays
It's just the nature of the beast
To jump into the fire
Tell me can you feel the heat
I see you walking on the wire
At the crossroads of the night
Too scared of passion but too lonely to learn
Nobody wants to lose control
Nobody wants to be the careless one
Throwin' caution to the wind
And makin' love is like trial by fire
And it's all a game
It doesn't matter who plays
It's just the nature of the beast
To jump into the fire
Tell me can you feel the heat
I see you walking on the wire
It's just the nature of the beast
To jump into the fire
Tell me can you feel the heat
I see you walking on the wire
