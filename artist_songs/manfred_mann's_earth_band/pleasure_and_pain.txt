Lover, lover, why do you push
Why do you push, why do you push
Babe, Babe, did you forget about me
'cause I've been standing at the back of your life
Back row centre, just above the ice
Please don't ask me how I've been getting off
It's a fine line between pleasure and pain
You've done it once and you can do it again
Whatever you've done, don't try to explain
Its a fine, fine line between pleasure and pain
Sooner or later you'll find your place
Find your body and you'll find your grace
I won't ask you how you've been getting off
No, I won't ask you how you've been getting off
It's a fine line between pleasure and pain
You've done it once and you can do it again
Whatever you've done, don't try to explain
Its a fine, fine line between pleasure and pain
Lover, lover, why do you push
Why do you push, why do you push
Babe, Babe, did you forget about me
'cause I've been standing at the back of your life
Back row centre, just above the ice
Please don't ask me how I've been getting off
Please don't ask me how I've been getting off
It's a fine line between pleasure and pain
You've done it once and you can do it again
Whatever you've done, don't try to explain
Its a fine, fine line between pleasure and pain
