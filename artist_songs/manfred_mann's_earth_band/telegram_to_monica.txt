When I woke up today, I thought about the things you said
Leaving me in loneliness, no plans to make without you
Trying to convince myself, nothing really matters
I must admit, I'm going to find it hard to cope,

When there is no reply
When there is no reply

Something inside my head screams there must be a reason,
No point to carry on, except to nurse my feelings
Must get to grips, accept the fact that I'm deserted
I must confess I'm going to find it hard to cope,

When there is no reply
When there is no reply
No reply from my telegram to Monica
No reply from my telegram to Monica
No reply from my telegram to Monica
No reply

It seems so long since I believed there was a meaning
An endless day, that seems forever to be yours
I must release myself from living in your shadow
Escape that darkness, and that shroud across my hear
