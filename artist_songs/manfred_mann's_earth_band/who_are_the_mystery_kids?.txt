Marcellino, Casanova, little angel from Laslow street
Cinderella, she's a crossover, she got no father in history
Got no good life, got no love life
Got no future, got no hopes and dreams
In a cruel world, in a cool world
You're a number, you're a mystery
Who are the mystery, mystery kids, the mystery kids ?
Who are the mystery, mystery kids, the mystery kids ?

Little Jimmy, hit and run boy
You can trust him, he'll take the strain
I remember when he said to me
There's a war going through my brain
And everyone still talks about the time
Sweet Mary drank all that wine
And I just cannot believe what I see
They're so strange they're a mystery
Who are the mystery, mystery kids, the mystery kids ?
Who are the mystery, mystery kids, the mystery kids ?

And I say fareewell as the lights go out
In the dark stairwell, can't take anymore

Marcellino, Casanova, little angel from Laslow street
Cinderella, she's a crossover, she got no father in history
In a cruel world, in a cool world
You're a number, you're a mystery
Who are the mystery, mystery kids, the mystery kids ?
Who are the mystery, mystery kids, the mystery kids ?
