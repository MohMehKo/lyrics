'Twas in another lifetime
One of soil and blood
When blackness was a virtue
And the road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness
A creature wild in form
Come in, she said, I'll give you
Shelter from the storm
Not a word was spoken between us
There was little risk involved
Everything up to that point
Had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place
Where it's always safe and warm
Come in, she said, I'll give you
Shelter from the storm
The deputy walks on hard nails
And the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters very much
It's the doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker
He blows a futile horn
Come in, she said, I'll give you
Shelter from the storm
