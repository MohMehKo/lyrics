Some people say she used to dance with the fish
Others say she juggled fire in a dish
She raised her hand and caused a 'lectrical storm
Down by the Bayou Saint John

She was a treacherous lady
She never made me much harm
One day she ducked past the station house
Turned on the fire alarm

Jump Sturdy Jump Sturdy was her name
She came out the swamps like a crazy fool
Jump Sturdy Jump Sturdy was her name
She came out the swamps like a crazy fool

Somehow she got tangled up with Queen Julia Jackson
On Melpomene and Erato Street
Queen Julia Jackson (trapped her?) Zozo Labrique
Jump Sturdy died in defeat

She was a treacherous lady
She never met much harm
One day she ducked past the station house
Turned on the fire alarm

Jump Sturdy Jump Sturdy was her name
She came out the swamps like a crazy fool
Jump Sturdy Jump Sturdy was her name
She came out the swamps like a crazy fool
