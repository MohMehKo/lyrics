Maybe I'll remember
The old house standing on the avenue
Till the day I die
Maybe I'll remember
The kids coming home from the playground
Sand in their shoes and their mother's eyes
Surely I'll recall the day in my life
When I looked in the eyes of a woman
And I knew right then and there that's my wife
And the world keeps turning
Like a big blue tumbling ball
And the times that you spend
With the ones you love just seem so small
Am I just a drop in the ocean after all
Maybe I will always
Think of myself as a young man
Holding both hands to the rod and the reel
Maybe I will always
Remember the day dad passed away
And I still don't know how to feel
There's nothing I love more than my family
When we all get to heaven
I hope for a minute
That they still remember me...
And the world keeps turning
Like a big blue tumbling ball
And the times that you spend
With the ones you love just seem so small
And the world keeps spinning
Like a big blue tumbling ball
And it's hard to believe
That you ever really played a part at all
Am I just a drop in the ocean after all
And the world keeps spinning
Like a big blue tumbling ball
And the world keeps spinning
Like a big blue tumbling ball
And it's hard to believe
That you ever really played a part at all
Am I just a drop in the ocean after all
