Through the night...through the dawn,
Behind you another runner is born.
Don't look back, you've been there.
See the mist as your breath hits the air.
And it's underneath the moonlight, passing some;
Still your heart beats in the moonlight like a drum.

Through the night...through the dawn,
Behind you another runner is born.
Don't look back, you've been there.
Feel the mist as your breath hits the air.
And it's underneath the moonlight, passing some;
Still your heart beats in the moonlight like a drum.

And you will run your time, a shooting star across the sky.
And you will surely cross the line, to pass on the flame.

Sun come up...sun go down.
Hear the beat, see the sweat on the ground.
Watch your step, keep your cool,
Though you can't see what's in front of you.
And it's underneath the moonlight, passing some;
Still your heart beats in the moonlight like a drum.

And you will run your time, a shooting star across the sky.
And you will surely cross the line, to pass on the flame, pass on the flame.

Through the night...through the dawn,
Behind you another runner is born.

And you will run your time, a shooting star across the sky.
And you will surely cross the line.

And it's underneath the moonlight, passing some;
Still your heart beats in the moonlight like a drum.

And you will run your time, a shooting star across the sky.
And you will surely cross the line.
