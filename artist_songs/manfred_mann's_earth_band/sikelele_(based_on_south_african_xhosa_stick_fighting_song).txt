Many reeds, strong reeds,
And the strong hands to bind them,
The women of Africa,
Knew just where to find them,
The sun said: dry them,
The river said: wind them,
The rope we could hold them,
Who came along behind.

[Chorus:]
Sikelele I'Africa, O'Sikele (lama),
I'Africa,
'Kose Sikelele Africa,
Sikelele Sikelele Africa

Many moons, many suns,
And days had their passing,
The people of Africa looked,
And they were working,
On the rocks, on the mountains,
The mines that lay before,
Drums for the first man,
Sing out the chorus.

[Chorus]
