I was walking auf der Helde
Got into some boggy parts
Squelch squelch
Fell into some footprints
Couldn't get out
But you never know "wo die Liebe hinfallt"
Wherever love drops it drops
Looking up I see this foot coming down
And from very high up a voice says
"Would you like my leg to climb up ?"
My eye travels up this very well built leg
Listen to what happens next
And up a very short skirt
And I think "wo die Liebe hinfallt"
Wherever love drops it drops
Up, I climb up
I climb up
I climb up
