You don't have to be a legend to survive
All you need now is a stronger plan
If you're wondering why we're here
We were waiting for your melt down
Behind a wall
You don't have to be a legend to survive
All you need now is a stronger plan
If you're wondering why we're here
We were waiting for your melt down

All I know is that mine is the fate
To be man on ice, man on ice
Behind a wall
