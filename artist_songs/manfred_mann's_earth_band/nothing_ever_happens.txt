Post office clerk puts up signs saying "Position closed"
And secretaries turn off typewriters and put on their coats
Janitors padlock the gate for security guards to patrol
And bachelors phone up their friends for a drink
While the married ones turn on a chat show
They will all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow
And nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all
The needle returns to the start of the song
And we all sing along like before
And we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow
Telephone exchanges click while there's nobody there
The Martians could land in the car park and no one would care
Closed circuit cameras in department stores
Shoot the same movies every day
And the stars of these films neither die or get killed
Just survive constant action replay
And nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all
The needle returns to the start of the song
And we all sing along like before
And we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow
By five o'clock everything's dead
And every third car is a cab
Ignorant people sleep in their beds
Like the doped white mice in the college lab
And nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all
The needle returns to the start of the song
And we all sing along like before
And we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow
