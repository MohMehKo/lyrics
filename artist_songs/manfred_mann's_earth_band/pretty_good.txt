I met a girl from Venus
And her insides were made of gold
Well, she did what she did and said "How was it, kid?"
She was politely told
"Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain
But actually everything is just about the same."

I heard Allah and Buddha
Were singing at the Saviour's feast
And up in the sky an Arabian rabbi
Fed Quaker oats to a priest
Pretty good, not bad, they can't complain
'Cause actually all them gods are just about the same

Moonlight makes me dizzy
Sunlight makes me clean
Your light is the sweetest thing
That this boy has ever seen

Molly went to Arkansas
She got raped by Dobbin's dog
Well, she was doing good till she went in the wood
And got pinned up against a log
Pretty good, not bad, she can't complain
'Cause actually all them dogs are just about the same

I got a friend in Fremont
And he sells used cars, you know
Well he calls me up twice a year
Just to ask me how'd it go
Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain
Actually everything is just about the same
