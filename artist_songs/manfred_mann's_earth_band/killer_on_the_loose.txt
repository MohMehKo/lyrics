Fear on the street, panic in the alley
You mustn't walk alone tonight
Blood on the wall like a river cuts a valley
The victim is an awful sight

There's a killer on the loose, knows just what he's doing
He's built around a heart of fire
Killer on the loose lurking in the shadows

Nobody knows exactly how he looks
But his picture's stamped on everyone's mind
You never see his face, attacks from the back
You better watch out behind

There's a killer on the loose, knows just what he's doing
He's built around a heart of fire
Killer on the loose lurking in the shadows
There's a killer on the loose, knows just what he's doing
He's built around a heart of fire
Somebody screams that there's a killer on the loose

There's a killer on the loose, knows just what he's doing
He's built around a heart of fire
Somebody screams that there's a killer on the loose
