It was in the evening paper under General Vacancy
"Part time man required in a local factory"
I put my Sunday suit on and I gave my old boots a brush
I got on my old two wheeler as I was in a rush

"Wait over there in the queue, come here when I call your name."
There's about ten or twenty part time men, they all look just the same
"Alfred Webster?" – "Yes, that's me." – "Kindly come this way."
With fingers crossed I follow him and I hope it's my lucky day

All I wanted to be was a part time man
(That's all)
All I wanted to be was a part time man

With shaky hand I started to the best that I was able
The man I had come to see smiled across the table
I filled in all questions, name, address and occupation
What I did in World War Three, and my present situation

All I wanted to be was a part time man
(That's all, that's all)
All I wanted to be was a part time man

I went back to the waiting room and they asked me what he said
Before I had time to answer a woman came out and shook her head
Returned from where I came from to my old and faithful cat
I turned off the light in my eyes and that's the end, that
Oh yeah

All I wanted to be was a part time man
All I wanted to be was a part time man
All I wanted to be was a part time man
(All I wanted to be was a part time man)
All I wanted to be was a part time man
(That's all, that's all, that's all)
