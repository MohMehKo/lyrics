At night - they will think they have seen the sun
When they see the mad half pig man
At night - screams, battles seen fought in the sky
And beasts will be heard to speak

[CHORUS]

Man, man your time is sand
Your ways are lives upon the sea
I am the Eyes of Nostradamus
All your ways are known to me

Driven back - the eagle back around the tents
Will be chased by the other birds
Driven back - with the sound of cymbals and bells
Will give sense to the senseless world

[CHORUS]

Think upon it - all of you who may read this verse
Listen and listen well
Think upon it - barbarians, idiots, fools stay far away

[CHORUS]

Oh, I had a dream
I thought I was alone
And the veil of all the years
Fell from my eyes like a stone

From the ground the seven year child
And a fire will come to the earth
From the sky at fourty-five degrees
And the stone will crack with the force

CHORUS

Oh, I had a dream
I thought I was alone
And the veil of all the years
Fell from my eyes like a stone
