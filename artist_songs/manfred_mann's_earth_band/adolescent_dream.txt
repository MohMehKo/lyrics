. You're not the great romantic
Crystal juke-box queen
You're not my old adolescent dream
You're not my spiritual gypsy
My fifty Chevy Machine
You're not my old adolescent dream

Oh no my friend
You stand above all that
You're my life
My love
My blood
My soul

You're not the way I planned it
The way it's meant to be
You're not my old adolescent dream

Oh no my friend
You stand above all that
You're my life
My love
My blood
My soul

Oh no, you're not my old adolescent dream
