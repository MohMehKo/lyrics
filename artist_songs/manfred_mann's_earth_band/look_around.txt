Look around and start thinking
What to do when the sun turns red
(??) there's gonna be nowhere
Take a deep breath, leave it in your head

Tell you what to do, (sir/son)
Tell you where to groove
Tell you how to move, (sir/son) (?)

It's happening while we're sitting here waiting
The only place is in your head
(You can pray?) that there's gonna be nowhere
Beat the foe into your head(?)

Tell you what to do, (sir/son)
Tell you where to groove
Tell you how to move, (sir/son)
