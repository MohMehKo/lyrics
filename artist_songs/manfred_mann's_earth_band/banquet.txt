Some get the gravy, some get the gristle
Some get the marrow bone
Some get nothing though there's plenty to spare
Some watch the paint peel, some watch their kids grow
Some watch their stocks and bonds
Waiting for that big deal American Dream

Took my dream down by the sea
Sailing yachts and lobster pots and sunshine
Logs and sails and shell oil pails
Down where the waterskiers glide

Some turn to Elvis, some turn to Africa
Some turn to rambling round
For a clean sky and a drinking stream
Who let the greedy in ?
Who left the needy out ?
Who made the salty sea ?
Tell them we're hungry for a sweeter fare

Took my dream down by the sea
Sailing yachts and lobster pots and sunshine
Logs and sails and shell oil pails
Down where the waterskiers glide

Some get the gravy, some get the gristle
Some get the marrow bone
Some get nothing though there's plenty to spare
Some watch the paint peel, some watch their kids grow
Some watch their stocks and bonds
Waiting for that big deal American Dream
