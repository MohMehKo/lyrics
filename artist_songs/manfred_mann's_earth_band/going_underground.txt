Some people might say my life is in a rut
I'm quite happy with what I've got
People might say that I should strive for more
I'm so happy I can't see the point

Something's happening here today
A show of strength with your boys brigade
And I'm so happy and you're so kind
You want more money of course I don't mind
To buy nuclear textbooks for atomic crimes
and the public gets what the public wants
But I want nothing this society's got
I'm going underground
We'll let the brass bands play and feet start to pound
I'm going underground
We'll let the boys all sing and the boys all shout for tomorrow

Some people might need some tension to relax
Me, I'm too busy dodging the flak
What you see is what you get
You've made your bed you better lie in it
You choose your leaders and your place your trust
As their lies wash you down and their promises rust
You'll see kidney machines replaced by rockets and guns
And the public gets what the public wants
But I want nothing this society's got
I'm going undergroud
We'll let the brass bands play and feet start to pound
I'm going underground
We'll let the boys all sing and the boys all shout for tomorrow

We talk and we talk until my head explodes
I turn on the news, my body froze
The braying sheep on the TV screen makes this boy shout, makes this boy scream
Going underground
We'll let the brass bands play and feet start to pound
I'm going underground
We'll let the boys all sing and the boys all shout

And the public gets what the public wants
But I want nothing this society's got
I'm going undergroud
We'll let the brass bands play and feet start to pound
I'm going underground
We'll let the boys all sing and the boys all shout

And the public gets what the public wants
But I want nothing this society's got
I'm going undergroud
We'll let the brass bands play and feet start to pound
I'm going underground
We'll let the boys all sing and the boys all shout for tomorrow
We'll let the boys all sing and the boys all shout for tomorrow
I'm going underground
We'll let the boys all sing and the boys all shout for tomorrow
I'm going underground
I'm going underground
I'm going underground
