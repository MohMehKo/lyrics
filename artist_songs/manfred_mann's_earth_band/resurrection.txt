Jesus Christ you've come out of hiding,
Just sign on the dotted line, I'll see you're OK
I'll say to you expenses are high,
Seeing you've made it before I'll take 20% and no more
(Gross)

Oh, tell me Lord did you happen to bring with you,
A saleable piece of the cross,
Crown of thorns,
A disciple or two.

We'll sell them Jesus hats, Jesus socks, Jesus coats,
We'll sue the Pope,
Jesus shoes,
Jesus dirty books too,
I wonder what will Billy Graham do.

Let me say how much I respect your wish,
To feed the multitude with 5 loaves and a fish,
But I'm sure you'll see by going on the road with me,
Will make the needy pay,
There's more money that way.

We'll sell them Jesus hats, Jesus socks, Jesus coats,
We'll sue the Pope,
Jesus shoes,
Jesus dirty books too,
I wonder what will Billy Graham do.
