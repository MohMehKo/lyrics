Martha has a madman
Standing hidden in the shadows
He's got a long curved Turkish dagger
With a bejewelled handle

He's tellin' her the world is full of freaks and geeks and simples and he's
Hiding like a leprechaun under stones and in the ripples
In the pool of time she thought she knew it - but someone threw a stone into it
Which breaks up the surface and it's making her nervous and it's true
What can she do --- yes it's true
What can she do ---
Martha yes I guess you'll have to wait around - another thousand years

Martha's gettin' nervous as she wanders through his valley
Where the shadows always frightening
And the whispers tell her stories

He's tellin' her the world is full of freaks and geeks and simples and he's
Hiding like a leprechaun under stones and in the ripples
In the pool of time she thought she knew it - but someone threw a stone into it
Which breaks up the surface and it's making her nervous and it's true
What can she do --- yes it's true
What can she do ---
Martha yes I guess you'll have to wait around - another thousand years

(What can she do --- yes it's true
What can she do --- yes it's true
What can she do --- yes it's true...)

Martha yes I guess you'll have to wait around - another thousand years
