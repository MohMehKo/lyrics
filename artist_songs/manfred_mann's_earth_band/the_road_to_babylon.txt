By the waters of Babylon
We lay down and wept and
Wept for these I am
We remember, we remember, we
Remember these I am

A golden helmet blinded minds
Among ten thousand swords
Along the road to Babylon
A golden thunder silenced songs
Among ten thousand voices
On the road to Babylon

Well, well, well, beware that golden helmet
Well, well, well
There's no easy way to go
Well, well, well
No easy road to follow
Well, well, well

A golden ocean turned to fire
And burned ten thousand ships
Along the road to Babylon
Golden dreamer touched the sky
Alone in empty silence
On the road to Babylon

Well, well, well
Beware that golden thunder
Well, well, well
That dreamed and sang the song
Well, well, well
The empty sound of sorrow
