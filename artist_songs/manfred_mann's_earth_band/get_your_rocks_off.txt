It was late one night on Blueberry Hill
One man turned to the other man with a blood-curdlin' chill

Get your rocks off
Get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, baby
Get your rocks off me

You know, there's two old maids layin' in their bed
One picked herself up, to the other one she said

Get your rocks off
Get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, baby
Get your rocks off me

We was cruisin' down the highway in an old Greyhound bus
All kinds of children in the side road, they were hollerin' at us
Layin' down around Mink Muscle Creek
One man turned to the other man, he began to speak

Get your rocks off
Get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, baby
Get your rocks off me
