Be not too hard for life is short
And nothing is given to man
Be not too hard if he's sold or bought
For he must do the best he can
Be not too hard when he blindly dies
Fighting for things he does not own
Be not too hard when he tells lies
Or if his heart is sometimes stone

Be not too hard for soon he'll die
Often wiser than he began
