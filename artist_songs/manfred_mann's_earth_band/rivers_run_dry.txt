If I could have just one more night
All I really need is some time
Nobody has to tell me just how good you feel
And I know it's real

When I wake you're not here at all
I know you've got my number on your wall
There will be brighter days ahead
But I've gotta find them
I don't need remindin'

And like a river can always run dry
Like a moon can rise in the sky
Like those tears you dry in your eyes
I'll always love you

All I need is one more day
It's so long to ...??
When I'm with you ...??
I don't need ...??

And like a river can always run dry
Like a moon can rise in the sky
Like those tears you dry in your eyes
I'll always love you

And like a river can always run dry
Like a moon can rise in the sky
Like those tears you dry in your eyes
I'll always love you
