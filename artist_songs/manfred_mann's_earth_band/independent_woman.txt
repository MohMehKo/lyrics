Lend me your ears dry up your tears
And let's hear the cheers for the year of the independent woman

You gotta break through this wall
Take a stand never fall
There may be one chance I know
Take it now one final go

Don't sit back stick on the track
You watch your back but give a damn
You've gotta be the one to keep it like that
To keep it like that, to keep it like that
Do what you have to do
Say what you need to say
Be what you want to be what you want to be

Lend me your ears dry up your tears
And let's hear the cheers for the year of the independent woman

You gotta break from these chains
You gotta make this your claim
You know it's all down to you
And we know who's to blame

It's been tough gonna get rough
You've had enough and you can tell
You gotta think what you can do about that
Can do about that, can do about that
Do what you have to do
Say what you need to say
Be what you want to be what you want to be

Lend me your ears dry up your tears
And let's hear the cheers for the year of the independent woman

Jede Frau ist Mutter, eine Mutter der Welt
Wir alle bleiben ihre Kinder, weil es lebenslang hält
Wir erschaffen und ernähren das was uns widerfährt
Weil der Bauch alle Dinge gebährt
Ist nur fair wenn du erfährst dass die Zeit alles nimmt
Und nichts bleibt was du in dieser Welt geboren hast
Es ist der Preis dass du erst weißt was Verlust heißt
Nachdem du es verloren hast

You gotta break through this wall
Take a stand never fall
There may be one chance I know
Take it now one final go

Let's hear the cheers for the year of the independent woman
Let's hear the cheers for the year of the independent woman
