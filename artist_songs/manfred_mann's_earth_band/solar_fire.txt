See the morning dancer, crossing the sky,
Turning gold to amber travelling by
He must know the answer
He must know why.
Looking for an answer look to the sky.

Shadows getting shorter filling your sight
Brightly burning starfire, life giving light
Dawning into morning
Day into night
Looking for an answer, look to the light

Sunlight streaming burn through the night
First light stealing shine solar fire.

Starting from tomorrow look to the sky
There's a new day dawning passing you by
Follow on life's dancer and than you'll know why
Looking for an answer look to the sky.

Sunlight [etc.]
