I been working so hard my backs near broke
My brows are wet and my throat's a choke
You sent me here for ten long years
I miss my whiskey I miss my beer
Ain't seen a gal since I don't know when
And the way you treat me won't see one again

Well, you can beat me
You can try to break me
Still I'll say to you
You'll never break my spirit
When my body's black and blue

Well in my arm there's a dreadful pain
It's hard digging ditches with a ball and chain
You broke my back cause I spat on a guard
That don't make me no better, that just makes me hard
Your water it stinks 'cause it comes from a bog
And the food you serve me ain't fit for a dog

You can beat me
You can try to break me
And still I'll say to you
You'll never break my spirit
When my body's black and blue
