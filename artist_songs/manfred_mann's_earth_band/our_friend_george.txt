Here you are once again
With your soul on show
And you sing 'bout the pain
On the fire inside of the Earth

Something just ain't right
Something just ain't true
About you

Telling me what to feel
And I know, my friend
Know you mean what you say
And I feel the same

Something just ain't right
Something just ain't true
About you

Telling me what to feel
And I know, my friend
Know you mean what you say
And I feel the same

Something just ain't right
Something just ain't true
About you
