There's a little spot in Mexico
Too small to be a village and not large enough to be a town
Joe plays the blues
Joe plays the blues because he needs to

Down in Mexicali there's a crazy little place that I know
Where the drinks are hotter than the chilli sauce
And the boss is a guy named Joe

He wears a red bandana plays a Blues piano
In a little old bar in Mexico
He's a cool survivor, plays an old synthesiser
And a honky tonk down in Mexico

First time that I saw him, he was sitting on a piano stool
I said "Tell me Joe when does the fun begin"
He just winked his eye and said "Be cool"

He wears a red bandana plays a Blues piano
In a little old bar in Mexico
He's a cool survivor, plays an old synthesiser
And a honky tonk down in Mexico

Joe plays the blues
Joe plays the blues because he needs to
Need is the ultimate monkey at the "Time Out Of Joint Caf√©"
A weird landscape of whacked-out plots
With hi-fi loving farmers who look more like organic ghosts
Being served by misanthropic robots
Joe only plays one song
One continuous vomitific never-ending song
Half spoken in some obsolete vernacular
He tells one long story about a girl
A girl he met down in Mexico

He wears a red bandana plays a Blues piano
In a little old bar in Mexico
He's a cool survivor, plays an old synthesiser
And a honky tonk down in Mexico

Joe plays the blues
Joe plays the blues because he needs to
