Saw Buddah walking down the street
I said, "Hey man, I never thought we'd meet"
Looked at me and he did a dance
He said, "Hey son, you gotta take your chance"

Saw Jesus in '65
Said, "Hey son, you're still alive"
He was standing in a riot zone
Said, "Hey man, why don't you go home?"
He said, "I never was, never will be
What you gotta do is carry on and forget about me"

Saw Moses in a Cadillac
Said, "Hey man, why did you come back?"
He looked at me and he did a dance
Said, "Hey man, you gotta take your chance"

Saw the saviour standing on the stage
He looked at me, I was in a rage
Looked my way and he said to me
"You gotta carry on and forget about me
'Cause I never was, never will be
What you gotta do is carry on and forget about me"
