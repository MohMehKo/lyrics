Well you've got your diamonds
And you've got your pretty clothes
And the chauffeur drives your car
You let everybody know

But don't play with me
'cause you're playing with fire

Your mother she's an heiress
On the block in St Johns Wood
And your father be there with her
If he only could

But don't play with me
'cause you're playing with fire

You're playing with fire
Old man took her diamonds
And tiaras by the score
Now she gets her kicks in Stepney
Not in Knightsbridge any more

So don't play with me
'cause you're playing with fire

You're playing with fire
Well you've got your diamonds
And you've got your pretty clothes
And the chauffeur drives your car
You let everybody know

So don't play with me
'cause you're playing with fire
You're playing with fire
