Baby there are pretty young boys
With shiny new toys that make the most noise
The way you look you can easily afford
To slam the door on any given nightstore
In a world where they put you on trial
Flick your hair, flash your smile
Get what you want, don't want what you got
But maybe be a little bit shy
You got me right through the heart
You got me right through the heart
You got me right through the heart
But you get it, right slap bang through the middle of your heart

Some time when you're feeling alone
Won't you call me at home or answer your phone
When you're free you can come and see me
Any time you feel the need
Or want to watch me bleed
In a world where they put you on trial
Flick your hair, flash your smile
Get what you want, don't want what you got
But maybe be a little bit shy

You got me right through the heart
You got me right through the heart
You got me right through the heart
But you get it, right slap bang through the middle of your heart
You got me right through the heart
But you get it, right slap bang through the middle of your heart
