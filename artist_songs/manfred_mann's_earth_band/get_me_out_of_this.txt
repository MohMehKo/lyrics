Sometime after seven there's a knock knock knocking at my door
Someone's out there yelling, "I can't take it any more"
He's waving round a gun it's a magnum 20 42
He said "It's full of bullets and I saved them all for you"

And I screamed "Get me out of this dream"
And I yelled "Get me out of this hell"

The world was really ending there was flame fire there was flood
Everything was freezing, my ears eyes balls and blood
Starship there from Venus, Captain Kirk and Doctor Spock
Then I heard Mick shouting "Hey babe it's nearly six o'clock"

And I screamed "Get me out of this dream"
And I yelled "Get me out of this hell"
