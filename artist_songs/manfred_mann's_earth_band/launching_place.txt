Up above a ball of fire, burns their bodies down below
The water surface leeches gather all around who bleed the show
Doctor, doctor take your shoes off, dance around in sheep's manure
The flies have blown five thousand corpses
Floating in your hang nail cure
The land no longer is a virgin
Empty sockets blankly stare at children making love to children
Children making love to children
