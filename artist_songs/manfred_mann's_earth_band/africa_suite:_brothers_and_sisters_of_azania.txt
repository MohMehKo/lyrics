Brothers and Sisters of Azania
It's still the same
The words they use are just a game
Brothers and Sisters of Azania
The wind of change
Will break the man who holds the gun
Brothers and Sisters of Africa
Amandla
It's not for me
Awethu
To say to you what you must do
Maatla aruna
Brothers and Sisters remember well
Amandal
They can't control
Awhethu
What's in your mind, what's in your soul
Maatla aruna
Brothers and Sisters of Azania
Amandla
The chains of time
Awethu
Will break the man who holds the key
Maatla aruna
