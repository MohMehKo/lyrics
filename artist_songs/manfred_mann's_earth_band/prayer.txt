Tell me, tell me, can it be right
The thing I feel I must do tonight?
Tell me Lord, don't you really see
The way I am and the things I could be?

Tell me, tell me, can it be true
The things I feel I must do with you?
Tell me Lord, are you really strong?
Do you feel that my feelings are wrong?

Tell me Lord, don't you really see
The way I am and the things I could be?
Tell me Lord, are you really strong?
Do you feel that my feelings are wrong?
