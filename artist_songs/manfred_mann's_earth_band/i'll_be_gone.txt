Someday I'll have money
Money isn't easy to come by
By the time it's come by I'll be gone
I'll sing my song and I'll be gone

Someday I'll have loving
Loving isn't easy to come by
By the time it's come by I'll be gone
I'll sing my song and I'll be gone

Living a life of luxury
Doesn't seem to be for me
That's not for me
Moving around comes naturally
Moving around and feeling free
That's for me
