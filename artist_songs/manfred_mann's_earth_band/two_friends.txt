One friend says "Just get on with your life"
And one friend says "There's no way you'll win this fight"
Sometimes it just ain't worth it
You gotta cut your loss

One horse won 'cause he did it right
And one horse lost though he fought with all his might
They were a long time running
It was a hard run race

One twin died as he saw the light
And one twin cried "You gotta fight the good fight
Oh there are hard times coming
It's such a hard hard road"

One man's song really sounds absurd
One man's song is the best you ever heard
They took a long time writing
Those rhymes are hard to find
