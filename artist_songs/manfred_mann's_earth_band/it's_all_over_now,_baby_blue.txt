You must leave now, take what you want, you think will last
Whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
He's crying like a fire in the sun
Look over there the saints are coming through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

The highway is for gamblers, you better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is painting crazy patterns on your sheets
The sky, too, is falling over you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
All your gathered armies, they are blowing home
Your lover who just has walked out the door
Has taken all the blankets from the floor
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
