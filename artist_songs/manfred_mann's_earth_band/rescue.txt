I shall be rescued someday
So many empty days
And nobody told me
Need to be rescued today
It's been a thinking day
And I haven't done badly

Haven't done badly how slow some days can go
Think I've been dreaming of some people I don't even know

Someday I'm sure to see the sun
And when my time has come
I'll think of you always
I see your face through the tears
I'm gonna try for you
But nobody told me

Nobody told me how slow some days can go

Think I've been dreaming of some people I don't even know

YOU GOT ME RIGHT THROUGH THE HEART Baby there are pretty young boys
With shiny new toys that make the most noise
The way you look you can easily afford
To slam the door on any given nightstore
In a world where they put you on trial
Flick your hair, flash your smile
Get what you want, don't want what you got
But maybe be a little bit shy

You got me right through the heart
You got me right through the heart
You got me right through the heart
But you get it, right slap bang through the middle of your heart

Some time when you're feeling alone
Won't you call me at home or answer your phone
When you're free you can come and see me
Any time you feel the need
Or want to watch me bleed
In a world where they put you on trial
Flick your hair, flash your smile
Get what you want, don't want what you got
But maybe be a little bit shy

You got me right through the heart
You got me right through the heart
You got me right through the heart
But you get it, right slap bang through the middle of your heart
You got me right through the heart
But you get it, right slap bang through the middle of your heart
