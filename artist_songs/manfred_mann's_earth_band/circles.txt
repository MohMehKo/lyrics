Going round in circles
Directions all messed up
I go to ground on a bottle of wine
And drown myself in the flood
My frozen toes are beginning to melt
I believe I'm catching a cold
Got oil on my feathers and I can't fly
I gotta get back to your love

I'm a clown without a circus
There's no-one to see my act
I can laugh and sing and stand on my head
Nobody knows where I'm at
???

My days are long and lonely
And I feel so insecure
There ain't nothing funny I'm losing you honey
I can't laugh anymore
I can't laugh anymore

Going round in circles
Directions all messed up
I go to ground on a bottle of wine
And drown myself in the flood
My frozen toes are beginning to melt
I believe I'm catching a cold
Got oil on my feathers and I can't fly
I gotta get back to your love

Old Chang surely told me
Not to mess with what you've got
But I went stomping all over your head
Like a bull in a China shop
My days are long and lonely
And I feel so insecure
There ain't nothing funny I'm losing you honey
I can't laugh anymore
I can't laugh anymore

I'm a clown without a circus
There's no-one to see my act
I can laugh and sing and stand on my head
Nobody knows where I'm at

Going round in circles
Directions all messed up
I go to ground on a bottle of wine
Drowning myself in the flood
