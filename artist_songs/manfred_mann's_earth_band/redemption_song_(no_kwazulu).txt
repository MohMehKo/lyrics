(No Kwazulu, No Kwazulu)
(No Boputatswana)
(No Lebowa). [Repeat]
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
For none of them can stop the time
How long shell they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look
Some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book

[CHORUS]

So won't you help to sing (No Kwazulu)
These songs of freedom (No boputatswana)
'Cause all I ever hear (No Transkei)
Is Redemption Song

Soldiers march their freedom
Out into the city streats
And though it seems like a loosing battle
These can be no retreat

[CHORUS]
