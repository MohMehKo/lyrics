Waiting for the rain,
Waiting for the rain,

You told me you were gonna make it,
You told me you were gonna win,
And I believed it was true,
Yes I believed, I believed in you.

There you go running through the alleys,
Can't you see you're waiting for the rain,
Look at you now wondering what you could be,
You've had all the hard luck you can handle,
Can't you see you're slipping down again.

And I believed it was true,
Yes I believed, I believed in you.

There you go, you're running through the fire,
Can't you see you're near the danger zone,
Look at you now, hiding from the sunshine,
You've had all the hard luck you can handle,
Can't you see you're slipping down again.

You deserve the sunshine and not the rain,
You deserve the rainbow, you've had enough pain,
I wanna see you win and get it all,
Hey, I never wanna see you fall.

Can't you see you're waiting for the rain,
Can't you see...
Waiting for the rain...
Waiting for the rain...
Waiting for the rain...
