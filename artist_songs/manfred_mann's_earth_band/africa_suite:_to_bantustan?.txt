What do they do with a man whose Father was a Swazi ?
What do they do with a man whose Mother was a Zulu ?
Where do they send him ?
Where do they send him ?

What do they do if that man's Grandmother was a Tsonga ?
Do they send him to Kwazulu, Bophuthatswana or Transkei ?
I ask why ?
What do they do to a man ?
They take away his freedom
What do they do to a man ?
They take away his woman
Where do they send them ?
Where do they send them ?
What do they do to a man ?
They take away his children
Oh, they send him to Kwazulu, Bophuthatswana or Transkei
I ask why ?
