Sheepdog standing in the rain
Bullfrog doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile ?
Childlike no-one understands
Jack-knife in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me

Big man walking in the park
Wigwam frightened of the dark
Some kind of loneliness is measured out in you
You think you know it but you haven't got a clue
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me

Sheepdog standing in the rain
Bullfrog doing it again
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me
