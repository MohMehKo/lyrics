You're on the run from the Law
You weren't happy, had to have much more
Now the heat is on
The heat is on
Don't look back
Hideaway
You keep going, just another day
'Cause the heat is on
The heat is on

You know you're in the hands of fate
You've done the worst
You must appreciate why
The heat is on
The heat is on
Run away on the night flight
Oh they got you on the run
You gonna live in the twilight
Oh the heat is on

Took your gold, took your chance
You got the money
And you got romance
Now, the heat is on
The heat is on
The time has come for you to go
You keep running
But it seems so slow
'Cause the heat is on
The heat is on
[repeat to fade]
