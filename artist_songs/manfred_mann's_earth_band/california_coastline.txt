Took off in San Francisco
Hitching up 101
Ended up on a flat bed Chevy
Breaking at the setting sun
Slept all night in a (coal hole?)
Thought I'd nearly freeze alive
'Cause all I had was a US blanket
Dated 1945

On the California coastline
Trying to have myself a good time
On the California coastline
Trying to have myself a good time

Got loose from jail in three days
(Sheriff had locked my base?)
(Maybe) ... (for Utah?)
... the human race
And if I live to be 100
Ain't never going back again
Couldn't think of a colder place to visit
(Or an easier place to sin?)

On the California coastline
Trying to have myself a good time
On the California coastline
Trying to have myself a good time

... (out of?) nowhere
Somewhere west of everybody else
I'm ... (out of?) nowhere
Somewhere west of everybody else
