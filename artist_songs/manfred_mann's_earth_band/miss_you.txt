Why's my face familiar
You might ask yourself if you really care
But you want to know everybody here
And I'm only twenty feet away and I miss you
Yes I do
How did I get this close again
I've got friends who'll say that they've never seen
The way I've been these troubled days
And now I'm only just three words away and I miss you
Yes I do
Yes I miss you now
More than ever
Body and soul
How we stick together
When you're not around
I'm going out of my mind
Seems to happen all the time
And I miss you now
More than ever
Body and soul
How we stick together
When you're not around
I'm going out of my mind
Seems to happen all the time
I miss you
Why's my face familiar
You might ask yourself if you really care
But you want to know everybody here
And I'm only twenty feet away and I miss you
Yes I do
