25 lbs. of pure cane sugar
In each and every kiss
You wouldn't know what I'm talking about
If you never had lovin' like this
I don't mean to be brash
You'll have to agree to that
She's 99 lbs. of natural born goodness
99 lbs. of soul
She's 99 lbs. of pure grade woman
99 lbs. of soul
25 lbs. of tenderness in each and every touch
25 lbs. of understanding her man
She don't want me to worry too much
24 lbs of something cool that I can't even name
And it all adds up to 99 lbs
Put together in a nice warm frame
She's 99 lbs of natural born goodness
99 lbs of soul
She's 99 lbs of pure grade woman
99 lbs of soul
She's 99 lbs of natural born goodness
99 lbs of soul
She's 99 lbs of pure grade woman
99 lbs of soul
