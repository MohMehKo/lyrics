Hello, this is your heart
You got me broken one too many times
Hello, this is your heart, speaking
You got me tired of one too many lies
Goin'away, taking your emotions
Leaving you as cold as ice
If you intend to keep on fooling
You must expect to pay the price
Goodbye, this is your heart
'Cause you got me going one too many times
So long, this is your heart, leaving
Wish you the best of loving
Till I'm coming home

Hello, this is your heart
You got me broken one too many times
So long, this is your heart, leaving
Wish you the best of loving
Till I'm coming home
Gaining love under false pretences
Lying with your eyes
So when you feel me moving out
It will come as no surprise

Been around too long
I've been around too long
Been around
