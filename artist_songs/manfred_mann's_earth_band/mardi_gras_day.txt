The big bass drum led the big parade
All on a Mardi Gras Day
The trombone was playing the tailgate song
All on a Mardi Gras Day
The bugler came down playing a bugle call
All on a Mardi Gras Day
And all that you could hear the people say
was, Oh Bah Lea

Everybody now comes .. (in line?)
All on a Mardi Gras Day
... are doing the second line
All on a Mardi Gras Day

All on a Mardi Gras Day
And all we're gonna say all night and day
is, Oh Bah Lea

The world danced down to St. Andrews Street
All on a Mardi Gras Day
From Chapitulla south to Magnolia Street
All on a Mardi Gras Day
I (espied/spied) the Injuns and ...
All on a Mardi Gras Day
And all that you could hear was the people saying
Oh Bah Lea
Black Eagles band plays ... Fee-Nah-Nay
All on a Mardi Gras Day
And all that you could hear was the people saying
Oh Bah Lea
