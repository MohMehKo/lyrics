Tied to the tracks
And the trains just coming
Strapped to the wing
With the engine running
You say that this wasn't in your plan
Don't mess around with the Demolition Man

[CHORUS]
I am a walking nightmare
An arsenal of doom
I kill conversation as I walk to the room
I'm a three line whip
I'm the sort of thing they ban
I'm a walking disaster boy.

Tied to a chair
And the bomb is ticking
This situation was not of your picking
You say that this wasn't in your plan
Don't mess around with the demolition man

[CHORUS]
