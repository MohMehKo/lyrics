Circle who beneath my feet
Also stand right above my head
Holding life in your hands so easily
O Circle you are our lives

Circle you contain the flame
And hold it deep inside
You who gave us the air and life we breathe
Circle you are our time.

Circle you are where we walk
And you are where we lie
Andthe colour we hear
And sound we see
O Circle you are our eyes.
