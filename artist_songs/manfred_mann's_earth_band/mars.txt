Rifle butts, band aids
Mortar bombs and hand grenades
Match battle cruisers
Who came out the losers
Lie in the long grass

Caught in the barbed wire
Halt or I fire
Cannon fodder faces
Put them through their paces

Mars the bringer the bringer the bringer of war
Destroyer of life, that's right, that's right

Atom bombs, night sights
Submarines and satellites
Flame thrower back pack
You just gotta fight back
Caught in the barbed wire
Halt or I fire
Cannon fodder faces
Put them through their paces

Mars the bringer the bringer the bringer of war
The bringer of war, what for
