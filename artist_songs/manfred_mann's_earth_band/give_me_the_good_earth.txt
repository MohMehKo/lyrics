Give me the good earth I was born on
Give me the sunshine the grass and the trees
Give me the open skies that I can dream on
Give me the flowers, the birds and the trees

Give me the good earth to lay my head on
Give me the mountains, the cool summer breeze
Give me the forests, the deep river valleys
Give me the oceans the fish and the seas

I don't need to know about the things that lay beyond my life
I don't need to know about the things that I don't need

Give me the good earth to rest my mind on
Give me the rainfall that fills empty streams
Give me the life in the hills and the meadows
Give me the seasons all the changes they bring
