It's not important for you to know my name
Nor I to know yours
If we communicate for two minutes only
It will be enough
For knowin' that someone in this world
Feels just as desperate as me
What you give is what you get, what you give is what you get
If I never ever see you
If I never ever see you
If I never ever see you...again

It doesn't matter if we never meet again
What we have said will always remain
If we get through for two minutes only
It will be a start
For knowing that someone in this life
Loves with a passion called hate
What you give is what you get, what you give is what you get
If I never ever see you
If I never ever see you
If I never ever see you...again

It's not important for you to know my name
Nor I to know yours
If we communicate for two minutes only
It will be enough
For knowin' that someone in this world
Feels just as desperate as me
What you give is what you get, what you give is what you get
