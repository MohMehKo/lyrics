Been running down the pavement
From my sworn enemy
He's right there behind
He's been shadowing me
No way to know where he's coming from
Don't know where to turn when I need someone
I took your open hand
just to pull myself free of the strain
And I didn't think I could breathe so easily again
Didn't think I could breathe so easily again
And I don't want to lose the touch
Cause I feel so much with you there
Been running down the pavement
From my sworn enemy
I don't know who he is realistically
Don't even know whose side I've been fighting on
Didn't even know there was a war to be won
Stay in my open arms
And I'll keep you in from the rain
And I didn't think I could breathe so easily again
Didn't think I could breathe so easily again
And I don't want to lose the touch
Cause I feel so much with you there
I don't want to lose the touch
Cause I feel so much with you there
Been running down the pavement
From my sworn enemy
He's right there behind
He's been shadowing me
No way to know where he's coming from
Don't know where to turn when I need someone
