I'm up and I'm leaving
Gonna spread my wings
Gonna get out the country to do big things
I'm up and I'm leaving
Gettin' out of this place
Gonna get on the Green Line to join the rat race

And if you see my ma or pa
Tell them that I ain't going far
I'm going to the great big city
I'm gonna buy what they call a car

I'm up and I'm leaving
Gonna spread my wings
Gonna get out the country and do big things
I'm up and I'm leaving
Gettin' out of this place
Gonna get on the Green Line to join the rat race

Gonna leave the fields and the crops behind
I'm gonna see what life's about
I know I've been saying it for the past six years
But now I'm getting out

I'm up and I'm leaving
Gonna spread my wings
Gonna get out the country and do big things
I'm up and I'm leaving
Gettin' out of this place
Gonna get on the Green Line to join the rat race

And if you see my friend
The one without a name
Say to him that I'm gonna go
But I ain't coming back again

Now listen Luke to what I say
If that Green Line comes around here
Tell all my friends when they come to the city
I'll buy them all a beer

I'm up and I'm leaving
Gettin' out of this place
Gonna get on the Green Line to join the rat race
I'm up and I'm leaving
Gonna spread my wings
Gonna get out the country and do big things
