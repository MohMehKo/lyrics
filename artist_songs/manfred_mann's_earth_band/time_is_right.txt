Sitting on this spinning top
Hoping time ain't gonna stop
Watching moons come turning round
Hoping time ain't slowing down
Just no place to run and hide
Time is right for quittin'time

Sun up hits you in the face
Seconds tick don't get no place
Sun that burned a million bones
Doesn't see you're all alone
Just no place to run and hide
Time is right for quittin'time

Time to hide no place to run
Ain't no hiding from that sun
Burning star will take its toll
Burns your body fires your soul
Just no place to run and hide
Time is right for quittin'time

Time to hide no place to run
Ain't no hiding from that sun
Burning star will take its toll
Burns your body fires your soul
Just no place to run and hide
Time is right for quittin'time
