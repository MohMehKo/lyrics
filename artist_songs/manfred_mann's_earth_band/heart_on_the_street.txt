I lay dreamin'
Electronic healer
Plugged in the groove
Not a thought in my head
Oh, you shook me away girl
Remember words that you said
Have a taste of another kind of fruit boy
Why not make all your dreams come all real
It's easy just keep your eyes open
Put your shoulder to the wheel
It's not my feet
It's just a heart on the street

Blue, Black and White
Can't we get anything right
What's the matter with you
What's the matter with me
It's just my heart on the street

I know, I know I'm just a John to your TV
I know, I know I'm just a radio Joe
But, pull me out the socket
And away we go
It's not my feet
It's just a heart on the street

Blue, Black and White
Can't we get anything right
What's the matter with you
What's the matter with me
It's just my heart on the street

Blue, Black and White
Can't we get anything right
What's the matter with you
What's the matter with me
It's just my heart on the street

Blue, Black and White
Can't we get anything right
What's the matter with you
What's the matter with me
It's just my heart on the street
