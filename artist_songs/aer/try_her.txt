[Hook - Dave:]
Man I’m feeling on fire, with my 40 pass the lighter
These girls lookin good, yeah I might try her
I might try her, I might try her
She looks good but her friends look a little nicer

[Verse 1 – Dave:]
I'm 18, I rock flow and smoke weed, tank tops, snap backs and rolled up jeans
I come from the dub so you can catch me on the scene
Either poppin j’s at coch or swimmin in the town beach
Sneakin up on rooftops, never catchin z’s
I'm ahead of the rest, plottin the next scheme
F-A-M we ready for the ride, it’s what you need
Comin’ from the kid in tie dye YEAH!

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Dave:]
Somethin’s tellin’ me to try it, license from London
She gotta be the reason for the riots and the spill of the blood
It’s a known fact
Taught in every class that I got the stats to snatch the rags off her back
I can get it no time
Just by starin’ in her eyes
Statue status we the cats the baddest
I can satisfy I swear cuz the raddest I’ve had it

Your girl’s all on me and I'm not gon' stop her (probably won’t!)
Backpack full of drinks, yeah I’m stocked up

She says she likes aer, we head upstairs
Blonde hair blue eyes and I’m tryin’ not to stare
She grabs her friend, to add to the pair
Shit two against one its really not fair

[Hook]

[Verse 3 – Carter:]
I’d say I’m doing better than a bed wetter who’s wakin’ up in a puddle
This girl’s really diggin’ it she’s got a shed of shovels
Threads are fresh, like a head of lettuce
I wanna use this kid’s guest room I’ll go see if he’ll let us
Sneak away, don’t be afraid, we finna stay outta the party like a damned kid
I grand slammed it, I’m glad I gotta try her, now she my number one fan ya dig?

Ya guys still drinking?
Cuz I'm Drinking more than you, yeah
It's what you need
