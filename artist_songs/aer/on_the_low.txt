[Chorus - Dave:]
Cause girl if you wanna stay over you should keep it on the low oh-oh oh-oh
Keep it on the low oh-oh oh-oh

[Verse 1 - Carter:]
Girl you need to keep it on the low
You want our spot to be blown?
You know my thinking’s clearer after dark
Get the lights off that’s the best part
And I know, that this has been a long time coming
But there’s a twenty deep list of people who I swear wouldn’t find this shit funny
If you’ve got the same intentions as me, I won’t end up running
Cuz you’ll keep your mouth shut, you know I’ll keep your tongue in
I don’t want lies, I just want time to lay you down, get hypnotized
Making every little minute that she with me a prize, secret’s got an upside
Don’t get pissed, no slammed doors, feeling good, nothing more
Girl I love what we got, you gotta

[Chorus - Dave:]
Keep it on the low oh-oh oh-oh
Keep it on the low oh-oh oh-oh

[Verse 2 - Carter:]
What’s next? I’ll come by later, now you’re with your friends so
Do us a favor and delete this text
I don’t fuck with the stress, look at what I got in my Guest
It’s a pack of king papers, a bag of bad behavior, to take you away from this mess
Girl I can’t fall in love with you, I’ve seen that side of me before
If you like our location under the radar, then lay low, and say nothing
If they ask I’mma stay
Ducking them signs, open the blinds, I’m focused on mine
Can’t fuck with my mind, I don’t have the time, I’m ducking her signs
They gotta

[Chorus - Dave:]
Keep it on the low oh-oh oh-oh
Keep it on the low oh-oh oh-oh

[Bridge - Carter:]
And you can come untie all my knots
And you can get back in to this bed of mine
