[Verse 1 – Dave:]
I step in the room, with two brews
I’m reppin FAM, the next up
No second guessing my plan
Flippin' O’s for 380 baby
Lately I just pace it
Workin’ on the same shit
Just not in my basement, now I’m east side chillin in my own crib
We all faced watchin’ goons doing dumb shit
I host the party while girls ain’t gettin’ off me
If I don’t like the look of your posse, oh
Sag in my jeans, followin dreams, not stoppin
I been over that robotic routine
Make them flip out, head over heels, I’m built for it
Show me to somebody important, or tell them

[Chorus – Dave:]
It’s the FAM, let’s get it goin’
If you’ve got a full drink, throw it back, it’s on
I don’t plan on gettin’ to know ya, so girl let’s live in the moment
Throw it back! if you’ve got a full drink! Throw it back! Throw it back!

[Verse 2 – Carter:]
All black change of clothes in my back pack
You can only see the top of my head from in front of this fat stack
Graffiting the game, painting my way to a million, I tagged that
I can grab the cheese without getting caught in a rat trap, that, that
That angle of you, for that I hate me too
It’s obvious that I bring the party like a lake that’s blue or a steak with a chew, 
or a private gate waiting for me to step Through, I’ll catch you, controlling the empire that I’ll get soon

[Chorus – Dave:]
It’s the FAM, let’s get it goin’
If you’ve got a full drink, throw it back, it’s on
I don’t plan on gettin’ to know ya, so girl let’s live in the moment
Throw it back! if you’ve got a full drink! Throw it back! Throw it back!
