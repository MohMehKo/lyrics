I said that I missed her, but I didn’t mean it
And then when I kissed her, wasn’t her Im seeing
I can’t help my feelings from fading away
Its not her I picture when I’m up daydreaming
So I went and wished her well
Can’t find a reason to stay together with you these days

Here’s comes the rain, to wash away the thought of you yeah
There’s go the pain, and all the shit you put me through
Was such a fool for you, i don’t know what to do
Here comes the rain, help me forget your name

I said I would visit but i didn’t make it
Another chance given, another mistake that doesn’t seem to trouble me at all
I promised to listen but i was escaping from inside your prison
This rain is erasing the past we shared so let it fall
Let it all fall, let it all fall
A new days coming with the presence of the sun
And lately I’ve been looking nowhere but up
Let it all fall, let it all fall for a better tomorrow
And forgetting the sorrow, I’ll be moving along

Here’s comes the rain, to wash away the thought of you yeah
There’s go the pain, and all the shit you put me through
Was such a fool for you, i don’t know what to do
Here comes the rain, help me forget your name

And now the sun is shining bright
After the rain comes the light
Can’t waste our time on a fight
Just keep on keepin’ on
