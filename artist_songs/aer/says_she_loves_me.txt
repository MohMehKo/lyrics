[Hook - Dave:]
She always says she loves me when we’re drinkin
Won’t admit it but it’s true
I think I’ve had enough of this one
So baby what’s your name, where you from, what’s good with you?

[Verse 1 - Carter:]
When she’s drunk she calls me a punk
She blow my phone up, she don’t know what’s up
When she drink that jack, she won’t call back
When she off that rum, she act so dumb

She won’t let me finish, she starts to go nuts

[Bridge - Dave:]

I wasn’t planning on it but I’m liking you
And we just met, but I get you
You seem like the type that’s got something to prove
Come on and dance, let’s see you move
This ain’t the first time that I’ve noticed you
Take off those heels, let’s keep em new
Now bring that body closer for a few
