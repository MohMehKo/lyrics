[Dave:]
Somewhere I been
It’s gunna be alright
It’s gunna be alright
Just know she got real
She got the only thing I want

[Carter:]
She got the style, she got the habits
She got everything I’d ever want plus magic
I know if she can roll then I can go with her flow
Not a concern if I burn
Seeing that I’m earning a little while learning a little something bout the game
She don’t care, she don’t care
If I go home with another name that night
Damn that’s right, she right there
Four Loko, barely toked though
She know my flow and what I wrote though
Her eyes’ll open up that door, no key
No time to ride that whip solo
Gotta grab her heart
Put on my halo, get a little false
Just for the day yo, ride down Rodeo
You’ll be my angel, no need to stay home

[Dave:]
Put the pieces in the puzzle and you’ll find
Just enough to help to keep you satisfied

[Carter:]
It may sound cliche but her smile can tell it all
I know ive chosen right when my highs begin to stall
And lies from our heads start to fall
The fighting is no wall
She’s safe with me even when were breaking the law

[Dave:]
We’ve been livin’ a lie
All I want is a try
A little love on the side gets me
Pullin’ over the ride
Drop the window and smile
She can tell me anything its me
