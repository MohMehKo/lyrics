Whatever you thought it was it ain’t
This the first time is hasn’t gone your way?
I got a long list of hearts to break
Gone all the time I’m too hard to date!
What? You gone call a lawyer?
Cuz I no longer adore Ya
I’m a heart thief go turn a new leaf movin on is important
Cut the cord in the courtyard, I’ll give Ya more than 4 stars
But I ain’t playing for keeps no you can’t keep me for ya
I wish you could understand, but my signs are hieroglyphic to Ya
You want to hold my hand, but you’re always just missing aren’t ya?

I’m rollin’
I’m drivin’, I’m focused
I’m straight gunnin’
Fast lane to the summit
You put me in this position [x4]

Whatever I thought it was it ain’t
You put a little too much on my plate
Tried to lock me down and that I hate
Sins can be committed by a saint, what?
You hate surprises? Couldn’t you see this for miles?
I might be a little bit bias, it’s not rocket science
Had a good time not lying, couldn’t be more clear I’m trying
To let you know that what you’re selling girl I ain’t buying
I wish you could a comprehend but what you want just isn’t comin to ya
And now for me I’m just onto the next I’m just lookin for someone cooler

I’m rollin’
I’m drivin’, I’m focused
I’m straight gunnin’
Fast lane to the summit
You put me in this position [x4]
