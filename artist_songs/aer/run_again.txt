Something makes me run from nothing
Fucked up more than once and
Cleanin’ off my slate before I run again

You couldn’t call me a saint, you’ll have to call me a sinner
Comitting bigger, than 21 saying “winner winner chicken dinner,”
I can’t get civil, filled with evil, evil
Travels in messages from owls and eagles
No flowers so freedom, yeah
I’ve done wrong, I’ve fucked up
Can’t take it back but I gotta face it with my fucking hands up
Her hate attack is tangable
Gimme one good reason I shouldn’t walk on out that door
And count that cash that could be caught without your walk upon my chest
I’m not, here

Not givin’ up some love is like a gun in my waistline
Safety off, got nowhere to be so I make everything take time
Everything remains fine, everyone runnin down their pre determined paths 
while I make my own, exploration around the world
Flown, to another destination, another girl
Never been that shiver down your little ass spine
Always been that plane of kush and a glass from the best vine

It’s 5 AM
And she knows
