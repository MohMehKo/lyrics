Cause I’m so gone
I’m still drunk
I ain’t going home
Man I’m so gone
Slurrin’ these words
Lettin’ shit burn
I’m so gone

Imma let her leave it up to her imagination
Livin an indulgent life don’t know bout moderation
Double barreled whiskey is a shot of concentration
I’m capable of facing any type of combination!
Having vivid dreams of moving to the west coast
With a centerfolded woman focused on my next toast
But i wake up from the black out and still tryna get thrown
I’m in the same situation I’ve been from the get go
I’ve been patient, damn i’ve waited
Something good is coming my way I can taste
I’ve remained hungry, through the opportunities to just take the money
Grey from sunny seen the skies turn
I’m about to acquire the satisfaction I’ve desired
Cuz I can only get bent for so long
The fire deep inside of the heart will burn in the bars of he who does no wrong

Cause I’m so gone
I’m still drunk
I ain’t going home
Man I’m so gone
Slurrin’ these words
Lettin’ shit burn
I’m so gone

At least I’m self aware I’ve been getting myself impaired
Don’t recite any prayers but Ive been blessed I swear
I’ve had it up to here with questionnaires that question affairs
That I partake in in my own time in my own damn lane
So lets take and trip and leave it, the scenic route, I’ve seen it
Convening with two beings, that meaning I’m loose leaning
Man exploration is the key to expansion
And lesson taking is the key to my mansion
Now if you can, if you can get through me
Get quick to kick the can, card trick hit different hands
Unless you can fit demands, that we gone keep command
Over the FAM, the FAM, now Some will run and some will stand
Imma hold my ground dig my feet in the sand
Just another night on the road, getting thrown
But we never ever gone forget the master plan

I can’t recognize, where I am, where am I
I can’t recognize, where I am, where am I
