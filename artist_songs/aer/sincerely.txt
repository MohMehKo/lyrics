[Hook:]
Been meaning to write you sincerely
So let me lay this down
Ain't much to say, ain't much to say, unless it’s a vow
So what’s this about?

[Verse 1:]
Give me nothing man, I’ll take it on my own
Got a whole lot to go, only slow when I've grown old
Well one piece of advice, for you limelight seeking shh
Twitter plus the couch equals you never gonna blow
You can talk a big game, you can want to walk to fame
The sidewalk ends fall off if the grind ain't the same as the FAM
Nothing to gain if you can’t get yourself outta the place that you claim can’t help, well
The ladder for me man keeps getting longer
The climb gets harder, my arms getting stronger
You blind old man cause you’re starting to wander
Snake of the game bringing nothing but problems
You on the come up like your leader's got his eyes closed
I’d arrive before you if I decide to drive slow
But I’m not I’m posted up never lie low
You’ll vanish real quick like your missing dog Fido

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
It’s a curse and a blessing to get this way in the first place
And your shit was supposed to drop around my 15th birthday
Gotta be real and cleaned up behind curtains
Is this really your grand scheme to prove that you’re worth it?
Well I've seen it before but good job
They click next stray away quick move along
Shake they head say They never going back to this blog
Can’t use your brights homie cause your heads filled with fog
If you want something grab it, if you have a beat stab it
Shitload of legwork not just living lash, I’m up at 3 AM and I’m still mentally active
Mind is traveling to a height that’ll send your ass packing
In the third row seat of the van realizing opportunities within patience
Instant gratification is not in the plans for your brand
Buzzer beater precision they coming running from the stands

[Hook]
