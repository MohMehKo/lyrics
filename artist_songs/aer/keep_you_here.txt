I see you checkin out these moves girl
Now lemme show you a thing or two
Whisper to me some good news
Aye I’m going places, I could bring you too
Now put down that drink, it’s time to impress ya
Get low on them kicks like ya never gonna stress em
We don’t need rest, cuz I’mma leave your body on fire girl

Girl your on my mind
Getting down on the floor
Girl give a little more
Girl I’m really really tryna keep you here
Girl I’m really tryna tryna keep you here
Girl I’m really really tryna keep you here
And you know I won’t let go of you baby

It’s too dark in here to see and too loud in here to talk
Let them hips do the walk
Fix your hair in your phone
You were born looking good
No need to repeat myself again
A little dirty dancing, not in Havana
Smoking on cubans, it’s me she’s a fan of
Ain't moving better stand up
You straight from Atlanta and know just how I like it girl

Girl your on my mind
Getting down on the floor
Girl give a little more
Girl I’m really really tryna keep you here
Girl I’m really tryna tryna keep you here
Girl I’m really really tryna keep you here
And you know I won’t let go of you baby
