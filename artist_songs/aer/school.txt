First question I ask before all my sessions
Bowl, bub or bong with some hemp wick
What do you wanna smoke
Something with 30 percolators maybe more
Get Asher on phone, it’ll be not too long
I’m getting high on Highgate, after school Friday
Someone is gonna get hit by the Vertigo
Laughing so hard I’m sideways
Shits mediocre, coke iced up, so I slide on down to loker
I don’t know, what to do with my life besides get high
And make music, on top of the world Carter
No I’m playin thatll never be me, I’m getting’ a sack
Breakin it up and rollin an L of some potentcy


Come and get high with me and my friends [x4]

Came in to get a new high, rubbin my eyes, light and my mind comes untied
Numb and I’ll live with the promising sign
Packin some of the kush in the bong, illadelph beaker bottom
Blood shot never get caught, pumpin up full throttle, double or nothin for models
Shouts to side sex and stressing on nothin, thanking my mother from bringin me up to something, 
songs about weed seem to be overseen, by the scene but please listen to these
Come and get high with me and my friends

And I be sippin’ on
Rippin’ bowls
Tippin’ hoes over
Zipper closed
Finger froze
Whoa bitch hold up!
Propellers, spin, in air when I lit the decimal at 3 in the mornin 
I look at the clock I’m zonin’ come and get high
