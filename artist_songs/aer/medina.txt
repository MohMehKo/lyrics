[David:]
I been sipping’ on the, I been sipping on the sand darling

[Carter:]
When I come around, I see the clouds are grey, 
the light, keeps me up high, floating away
If the sun shines, off my eyes, I fall to my feet, 
the skies, are a clear blue, my blind fold to grey

[Carter:]
Walking through the field, into, 
the textures on my hand are sliding, 
flowing, through, the sounds are growing yeah, 
I’ve been locked up for days, the nature and the sky, make me wanna breathe

[David:]
I been sipping’ on the, I been sipping on the sand darling

[Carter:]
I’ve been sipping on the sand darling, 
I’ve been writing with my hands all night
