[Carter:] Few times you been
[Dave:] walking' through my front door
[Carter:] Spend my money but I'm
[Dave:] Slowly makin' back more
[Carter:] Never knew I had
[Dave:] Time to even the score I let you take all I had to give

[Carter:]
I'm not a soldier, a gangster,
and I've reached the point of leaving, I never thanked you,
for making up my mind, I just don't have the time,
girl you act like a child, so don't expect me to wait for you, no,

Now I feel like I've won it, that's right,
comin' out the trouble, after massive attack,
I'm pullin' myself up from the rubble,
never end up face down, my heart in her hands again,
I'mma pass my love to crowds and spill my soul out with this pen,
and I can't be walked upon, well I've had enough,
let you win at mini golf, bitch you can't even putt,
thought I'd take a bullet for you, thought you're worth my blood,
It's obvious you'll never notice what's up girl

I've been done with this bullshit business
since this kiss stopped being what I want,
90 percent of the hours consisted of you pissed, only 10 of love
had to cut her rope (snip), layed out upon the hammock,
got out of there quick like a qualified bandit,
and I've been searching for a fresh new twist,
finally have them keys to rid them cuffs around my wrist,
I can be on my way, you got no words to say,
that can change my mind, I'm not playin' games

[Carter:]
And all I had to give (all I had to give)
was taken relentlessly,
and all I wanted to gain (all I wanted to gain)
washed right away with this evening's rain
