[Carter:]
Swoop down get it in bounce, the town’s silence
A room the finest woman full of diamonds
I find this evening to be more than a rumination runnin back 
and forth through the doors of this colorful scene and I
She my queen and I’m the king
Runnin things and I got my eyes on it, I want it
My dreamcatcher caught it
Sick of it I’ll rhyme illicitly on the front screen
While in touch with the aquamarine
Hot topic is what you can’t normally see
Fires only burn when they room to breathe
