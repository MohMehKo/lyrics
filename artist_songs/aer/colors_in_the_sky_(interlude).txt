Saw the evident potential with both eyes
Could tell it when I met you on the lower side
Getting high ain’t fun if you don’t float by
Calm these hounding nerves before the show time
And if you’re not in the equation it don’t sound good
Had to climb a high mountain before I found you
You’re the root of my talents from the ground up
They could love you like I do the whole town could

Colors in the sky
When you’re by my side
Love to see you laugh
Hate to say goodbye
But these colors in the sky
Remind me that you’re mine
You know I’ll see you soon
Keep taking it in stride
Colors in the sky
