I’m sportin a buzz cut, cuttin the buns up
Fun I woulda done stuff with you and your rum rushed tut fucks
Tough luck my friend but today’s not the end
I’ll livin another day seein another face
And I’m a super bowler with the nuts the bolts
See what I got in my folder, files and styles from when I’m older
Futuristic egotistic, sin and a whisky
Fillin the quiet with my two timing and rhyme schemes Simon says to me just please stay tracking on, 
go hard but not off the course like home alone on a Saturday night 
gettin fucked up send an invite all, tiring but peaceful til you get that call
