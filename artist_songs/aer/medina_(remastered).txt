I’ve been sipping’ on the, sippin’ on the, sippin’ on the
I’ve been sipping on the..

When I come around
I see the clouds are grey
The light, keeps me up high, floating away,
If the sun shines, off my eyes
I fall to my feet
The skies, are a clear blue, my blindfold to grey

Walking through the field
Into, the textures on my hand are sliding, flowing, through
The sounds are growing yeah
I’ve been locked up for days
The nature and the sky, make me wanna breathe
(When I come around
I see the clouds are grey
The light, keeps me up high, floating away,
If the sun shines, off my eyes
I fall to my feet
The skies, are a clear blue, my blindfold to grey)

I’ve been sipping on the sand darling
I’ve been sipping on the sand darling
I’ve been sipping on the sand oh yea, oh-oh
I’ve been sipping on the sand darling
I’ve been sipping on the sand darling

I’ve been sipping on the sand darling
I’ve been writing with my hands all night

When I come around
I see the clouds are grey
The light, keeps me up high, floating away,
If the sun shines, off my eyes
I fall to my feet
The skies, are a clear blue, my blindfold to grey

To grey, to grey, to grey..
