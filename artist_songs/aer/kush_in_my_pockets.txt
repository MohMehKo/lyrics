[Dave:]
Yo Rue is that shit rolled up?

[Hook - Dave:]
Good kush in my pockets
Chicks at my spot be the hottest
Air max under my new corduroys
Neighbors telling me to turn down the noise
Huh? what? why you gotta ruin my buzz?
Huh? what? come on man…

[Verse 1 - Carter:]
If I got Kush in my pockets, during a show, you know I’mma rock it
Carter’s got no plans of stopping, hop on this hop beat, try and top it
She watch Degrassi, heels on the coffee table, blow like kamikaze
Hit up Ohio to kick it with Bobby, folded like origami
You keep saying let’s drink, but you never pour
Fruit of the loom, cream of the crop at the door
Nice effort girl don’t try to allure me, if you fuck with me you needa know, well
I make a sane girl crazy, a go getta girl lazy
Been running the same crew, humming the same tune since i was a baby
Two decades later they say they gon crave me, so light up that good
Let’s get this room purple hazy

[Hook - Dave:]
Good kush in my pockets
Chicks at my spot be the hottest
Air max under my new corduroys
Neighbors telling me to turn down the noise
Huh? what? why you gotta ruin my buzz?
Huh? what? come on man…

[Verse 2 - Carter:]
I’m gripping a Tennessee honey and sipping the other
I live under cover
Cuz when you unwrap it
I’m like the commander of action
While ripping a verse
And flicking my ash
If you thinking of shit talking, and cutting my line
I’m coming running with a hundred summoned buddies of mine
Y’all know Griffin will flip on the sinners
And Gabe will be holding it down
And Glove will come through at the end of it all with a clutch amount of that loud
Gotta go a hundred miles for you to get what you want
Got mine right here rolled up in this blunt
Gotta go a hundred miles for you to get what you want
Got mine right here rolled up in this blunt

[Hook - Dave:]
Good kush in my pockets
Chicks at my spot be the hottest
Air max under my new corduroys
Neighbors telling me to turn down the noise
Huh? what? why you gotta ruin my buzz?
Huh? what? come on man…
