What have we become
It seems our hearts have come undone
And even when I hold you in my arms you're
out of reach
I would walk a thousand miles to get to you
Ten thousand more to get you back into me

But the more I reach the more you run
(I can't get to you)
The more I reach the more you run

I feel so far
I feel so far away
From where you are
I feel so far away

Silently pretending
We're not alone and nothing's ending
Lost in the familiar
We've forgotten how to dream
I remember a time when you and I
Believed in forever
I want that again

But the more I reach the more you run
(I can't get to you)
The more I reach the more you run

I feel so far
I feel so far away
From where you are
I feel so far away

Standing on the edge
Looking for a bridge
Reaching out but I can't get to you
Get to you
Standing on the edge
Looking for a bridge
Do everything I do to get to you
Get to you
I'm standing on the edge
Looking for a bridge
I'm reaching out but I can't get to you
Get to you

I feel so far
I feel so far away
From where you are
I feel so far away

I feel so far
I feel so far away
From where you are
I feel so far away

I'm standing on the edge
Looking for a bridge
I'm reaching out but I can't get to you
Get to you
