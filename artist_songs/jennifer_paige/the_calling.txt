There's nothing to say
There's nowhere to go now
I guess everything changes
Safe in the dark
Heart in a black out
But nothing erases

What's locked deep inside 
And with the passing of time 
I try to move on, you won't let me go 

I hear you calling 
Words I long to hear 
So temporary 
Take me away from the ordinary
I feel you haunting 
Feel you in the air 
Why do we dare 
When there's just so many ways to say farewell

Another day
I go through the motions 
Everything's distant 
Memories fade 
But this strange devotion 
Breaks my resistance 

So much has been broken 
And words left unspoken 
Lost in the silence 
Speak to my soul 

I hear you calling 
Words I long to hear 
So temporary 
Take me away from the ordinary
I feel you haunting 
Feel you in the air 
Why do we dare 
When there's just so many ways to say farewell

I hear you calling 
Words I long to hear 
So temporary 
Take me away from the ordinary
I feel you haunting 
Feel you in the air 
Why do we dare 
When there's just so many ways to say farewell
