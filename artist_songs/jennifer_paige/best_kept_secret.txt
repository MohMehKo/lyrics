The smell of alcohol, breathe it down my throat
So I choke cause it tastes so sweet, yeah
Bitten nails never fail to please me
They hunt me down, then they search me out

No one ever has to know
Forget my name before you go

So be mine
Oh be my
You're my best kept secret
Oh be my
So be mine
You're my best kept secret

The smoke of cigarettes fills the room right up
Hold me down by the hands you bound up
You grip the hourglass, I lick the tattoo
You're a fantasy but that's good for me

No one ever has to know
Forget my name before you go

So be mine
Oh be my
You're my best kept secret
Oh be my
So be mine
You're my best kept secret

The smoke of cigarette it fills the room right up
Hold me down by the hands you bound up 

So be mine
Oh be my
You're my best kept secret
Oh be my
So be mine
You're my best kept secret
