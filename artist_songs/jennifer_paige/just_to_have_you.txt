It's a full moon night
Something ain't right
Wind is banging on my door
Call me insane
I want this pain
But it's justified, it's justified, it's justified
I swore I would never be this way
But I can't stop this runaway train

[Chorus:]
I can't get you out of my dreams
I tell you I'd do anything
Just to have you here with me
I know that I'm in way too deep
I would give up everything
Just to have you here with me

There's a fire in my head
Making me sweat
Keeps me coming back for more
Well it's crazy in here
Cause I want these tears
But it's justified, it's justified, it's justified
I swore you'd never make me feel this way
But I can't stop this runaway train

[Chorus]

Don't know right from wrong
Don't know where I'm going
Spending all my nights in a restless bed
For you love I'm waiting
It's too late, it's too late to hold my heart steady 
pending my nights in a restless bed
There's a fire raging in my head
