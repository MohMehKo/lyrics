Have you ever felt something that you've got to get out, let it out
Ever wanna know someone from the inside out, what they're about
You never know what life will bring
Try and you just might be surprised

Be free 
Love doesn't wait forever
Don't ever hesitate
Be free
Life won't wait forever
Don't let it be late
Be free

Have you ever needed to say something you just couldn't say the right way
Ever bit your tongue, put it off, gonna have to wait one more day
Well, you never know how time will fly by
So, you just might live your own life
So, go on

Be free 
Love doesn't wait forever
Take what you wanna take
Be free
Life won't wait forever
Don't let it be late

Take some time to live for the moment
There's no time to waste not a second
Live for today
Take some time to live for the moment
There's no time to waste not a second
Live for today

If you're gonna lose control
Just let it all go
If you keep moving on
Nothing can hold you down
So, be free
