Who's gonna know you better
Gonna rule the world if you let her
Don't need a golden rule to know the way back home
Follow the fire, warm like a sunny day
Light up the sky, with the sound of your name

Starflower, fear this heart
Fear this love unconditional
Never alone
Starflower, fear this heart
Fear this love unconditional
Never alone

Oh darling, never say never
There's always gonna be a bigger picture
There's no mistakes when you're making something beautiful
Burn like a fire, warm like a sunny day
Color the sky, with the sound of your name

Starflower, fear this heart
Fear this love unconditional
Never alone
Starflower, fear this heart
Fear this love unconditional
Never alone

Across a million miles
We belong in this galaxy of our ow
In the darkest nights
This is your song
Shine on and on and on and on

Starflower, fear this heart
Fear this love unconditional
Never alone
Starflower, fear this heart
Fear this love unconditional
Never alone

And on, and on, and on
And on, and on (never alone)
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on (never alone)
And on, and on (never alone)
