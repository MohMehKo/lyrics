Days and nights and days
Been caught in a rhythm
Can't keep running
Never look
Never looks back
To the promises broken
But can't help wondering
On a day like today
When there's nothing new
What's she gonna do
Another day like today
With the same old view

Stepped out to life
In full bloom
Got lost under the sun
Blinded
She still moves on
Coming undone
When she dreams in color
It's only black and blue
She's like a fading flower
And life's in full bloom

Watching the world
Go around
She picks up the pieces
Goes through the motions
Swears
That she'll never go back
But she can't move forward
Stuck in the middle
On a day like today
When there's nothing
Left to lose
Oh, what's the use
Another like today
Feels like
There's nothing's left
Nothing to lose

Stepped out to life
In full bloom
Got lost under the sun
Blinded
She still moves on
Coming undone
When she dreams in color
It's only black and blue
She's like a fading flower
And life's in full bloom

She never dreamed
That she could fly away
No
She never dreams
That she could fly away
Hey
But she still moves on
Coming undone

When she dreams in color
It's black and blue
She's like a fading flower
And life's in full bloom
