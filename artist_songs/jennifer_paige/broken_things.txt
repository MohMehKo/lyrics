You can have my heart but it isn't new
It's been used and broken and only comes in blue
It's been down a long road and it got dirty on the way
If I give it to you will you make it clean wash the pain away

You can have my heart
If you don't mind broken things
You can have my heart
If you don't mind these tears
I heard that you make all things new
So I give these pieces all to you
If you want it, you can have my heart

So beyond repair, nothing I could do

I tried to fix it myself but it was only worse when I got through
But then you walked right into my darkness and you speak words so sweet
You hold me like a child til my frozen tears fall at your feet

You can have my heart
If you don't mind broken things
You can have my heart
If you don't mind these tears
I heard that you make all things new
So I give these pieces all to you
If you want it, you can have my heart
