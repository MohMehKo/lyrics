Every day it gets deeper, feels like I'm walking on the ocean floor
Another day I'm flying, that just leaves me wanting more
Looking for a place to land
I've been reaching for your hand 
What's it gonna take to get you to notice me
Why can't you see

I fall hoping that someone will catch me
I hold on wanting only you to save me
How long are you gonna keep me waiting, all alone
I'm lost in the downpour

Where do we go from here, feels like I'm drowning, I?m going under
Is there a break in the clouds or could I be dreaming,
It makes me wonder if I'll ever be
The one that you need
What's it gonna take to get you to see me

I fall hoping that someone will catch me
I hold on wanting only you to save me
How long are you gonna keep me waiting, all alone
I'm lost in the downpour

I fall hoping that someone will catch me
I hold on wanting only you to save me
How long are you gonna keep me waiting, all alone
I'm lost in the downpour

If only, if only
If you could wash away the rain
And show me, and show me
Show me how to feel again
I'll never, I'll never
No, I'll never be the same

I fall hoping that someone will catch me
I hold on wanting only you to save me
How long are you gonna keep me waiting, all alone
I'm lost in the downpour
