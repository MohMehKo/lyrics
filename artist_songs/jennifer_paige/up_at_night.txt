I took the apple, somehow I'm still around
I drink your poison, they say that's not allowed
Oh, nobody ever made me feel this way
I'm falling for you, I fall for you babe
Tell me what you know, I wanna hear
Show me that you love me, if you dare

That's what keeps me up at night
That's what keeps me up at night
Need you here right by my side
The way you love me right, love me right

That's what keeps me up at night
That's what keeps me up at night
Ain't no sleeping with you by my side
The way you love me right, love me right
You love me right

My mama told me, that I could do no wrong
I shoulda listened, but baby that's no fun
Oh, nobody ever made me feel this way
I'm falling for you, I fall for you baby
Tell me what you know, i wanna hear
Show me that you love me, if you dare

That's what keeps me up at night
That's what keeps me up at night
Need you here right by my side
The way you love me right, love me right

That's what keeps me up at night
That's what keeps me up at night
Ain't no sleeping with you by my side
The way you love me right, love me right
You love me right

That's what keeps me up at night
That's what keeps me up at night
Need you here right by my side
The way you love me right, love me right

That's what keeps me up at night
That's what keeps me up at night
Ain't no sleeping with you by my side
The way you love me right, love me right
You love me right
You love me right
You love me right
