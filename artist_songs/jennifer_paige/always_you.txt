I see a mystery ship out on the water
I wonder where it's sailing to
Is someone waiting in some other harbor
These fantasies they blow my way
Like sirens to a fool
And in the stillness of my soul
I keep returning to

[Chorus:]
Always you
You know I live out on the wind where love runs free
I come back to you
Always you
And when I fall to earth you're always there for me
I come back, I come back, I come back to you

Looking at myself 'til the mirror shatters
I hear a madman sing his tune (he says)
It's only love that ever really matters
I wake up in this dream tonight
That's when I see the truth
Of all the faces in my heart
There's only one I choose

[Chorus]

Something in my soul never changes baby
You're the one that's keeping me sane
There is no other I have ever conceived
Could be my lover and never leave when I run free
That's when I see the truth
Of all the faces in my heart
There's only one I choose

[Chorus]
