It's in your eyes, you wanna cry
But your afraid to let go
Sometimes the past comes rushing back
Emotions overflow
You don't have to worry you know I'll understand
I wanna help you through it, anyway i can
I'm gonna be here for you, take my hand
Break through these skies of gray, don't hold back

[Chorus:]
Let it rain
Let your teardrops wash away the pain
By your side I promiseto remain
My love will pour like sunshine through the rain
Let it rain

With every touch, I'll earn your trust
You'll see my love is for real
So let me in, I'll show you how to love again
Don't have to hide how you feel
I'll be here to hold you, hold you when you cry
With my tenderness push the clouds aside
We'll make tonight the night you leave it all behind
Break through these skies of gray, don't hold back

[Chorus]

You'll see a brighter day
Let my love lead the way
To a rainbow in the sky
Tears of joy fill your eyes - let it rain
