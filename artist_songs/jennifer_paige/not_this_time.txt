Started seeing trouble in your eyes
Followed you around just a little while
Didn't want to believe you could do me wrong

Did her lips taste as sweet as mine
Did she fall for all your fancy lines

You run around on me with another
Think that you can do better

You said I was everything
(Don't want to see you 'round here no more)
But you'd tell me anything
(I don't wanna see you come back for more)
Did you think I would take you back
(Did you really think that I'd take you back)
Never take you back
Not this time

Now you say you're sorry for what you've done
That I will always be the only one
Well, you can take your sorry's to someone else

You ran around on me with another
Thought that you could do better

(no, no, no, baby, uh, uh, uh)
You said I was everything
(Don't want to see you 'round here no more)
But you'd tell me anything
(I don't wanna see you come back for more)
Did you think I would take you back
(Did you really think that I'd take you back)
Never take you back
Not this time

I covered you in roses
And I fell for your disguise
But it doesn't seem so pretty now

(no, no, no, baby, uh, uh, uh)
You said I was everything
(Don't want to see you 'round here no more)
But you'd tell me anything
(I don't wanna see you come back for more)
Did you think I would take you back
(Did you really think that I'd take you back)
Never take you back
Not this time

Did you really think that I'd take you back
