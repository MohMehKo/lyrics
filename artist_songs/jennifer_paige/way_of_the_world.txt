Who he is
Who I am how we move
I just sit and watch the frenzy
I can't catch my breath to stop and see
Is this what you meant
Is this happy
What's going on all around me
I just can't work it out exactly
It all comes down so abstractly

It's the way of the world of you and me
It's every wish I ever made or ever thought I might
It's the way of the world of you and me
Baby all I know is I love the way I feel tonight
It's the way of the world
It's the way of the world

What does it mean
All the flowers I've received
It must be raining botany
Spinning and flashing and dashing
And narrowly escaping
In an accent that I'm sure he's faking
But then we just burst out laughing
What zone is this we're passing

It's the way of the world of you and me
It's every wish I ever made or ever thought I might
It's the way of the world of you and me
Baby all I know is I love the way I feel tonight
It's the way of the world

I'm thinking to myself
Baby with you all I know is I go somewhere else
Lost in the mystery
In some other world
There's nowhere else I'd rather be

It's the way of the world
It's every wish I ever made or ever thought I might
It's the way of the world of you and me
Baby all I know is I love the way I feel tonight

The way of the world of you and me
Baby all I know is I love the way I feel tonight
It's the way of the world of you and me
It's every wish I made or ever thought I might
It's the way of the world of you and me
Baby all I know is I love the way I feel tonight
It's the way of the world of you and me
