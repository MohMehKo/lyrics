Darling we taunt in fate
Why even bother denying it?
You try and tell me I'm safe
But those lips I've kissed, I'm not buying it

Kingdom's fade, and empire's fall
There ain't no use in building walls
Let it all crash down for me and you
If the destiny were bound to

Our love is like a bomb, 
Were running out of time
Better do something fast
This wasn't built to last
Our love is like a bomb
Disaster in the wake
We burn, we own the night
'Til it all goes up in flames
Our love is like a bomb
Our love is like a bomb

Time is not on our side
We both know we can't hide from it
We lit the fuse just right
Yeah we knew, we knew, the consequence

Stars been out, and leave no trace
Almost like they got erased
We self destruct, off of love
We can't escape what we're made of

Our love is like a bomb, 
Were running out of time
Better do something fast
This wasn't built to last
Our love is like a bomb
Disaster in the wake
We burn, we own the night
'Til it all goes up in flames
Our love is like a bomb
Our love is like a bomb
It's ours until it's gone
Our love is like a bomb

Our love is like a bomb
Disaster in the wake
We burn, we own the night
'Til it all goes up in flames
Our love is like a bomb
Our love is like a bomb
Our love is like a bomb
Our love is like a bomb
