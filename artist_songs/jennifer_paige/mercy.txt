I got nothing but love for you honey
It don't matter if you ain't got money
I got chills running down from my head to my feet
But my temperature's rising I can feel the heat
Cupid ain't got nothing on you, boy

You keep me up until early morning
Lord, I swear, you outta come with a warning
I feel so high I get weak in the knees
I ain't gonna lie, I love the way that you tease
You got me beggin', beggin' mercy

I quit, I give in
'Cause there's no way to win at this game
If this love is a sin
Then I’ll be going down in flames
Never gonna be the same
Oh, mercy

I've been feelin' hot and bothered
You got a way that's like no other
You found my weakness and you tightened your grip
And, I’ve been held a captive to that night ever since
So, lock me up and throw away the key, boy

If your lovin' is a crime, I surrender
Go and take me baby as your prisoner
I'm where I wanna be, crying mercy

I quit, I give in
'Cause there's no way to win at this game
If this love is a sin
Then I’ll be going down in flames
Never gonna be the same
Oh, mercy
