If I had any luck in the world you and I would be together
'Cause you roll in and shower me like rain in the middle of the summer
You're like a cool breeze blowing
Wanna feel the wind rushing through my hair
Cool breeze, cleanse me
All I know is I feel you everywhere 

Every day's a little better as long as I'm here in the sunshine
Every day's a little better as long as I'm here in the sunshine
La la la la la la la

Maybe I'm just dreaming here to think you would surrender
'Cause you stroll in like a sunny day in the middle of the winter
Just like a cool breeze knowing
That you could fly away and leave without a care
Cool breeze, floating
All I know is I still feel you in the air

Every day's a little better as long as I'm here in the sunshine
Every day's a little better as long as I'm here in the sunshine
La la la la la la la

Don't go away, please stay

Every day's a little better as long as I'm here in the sunshine
Every day's a little better as long as I'm here in the sunshine
La la la la la la la
