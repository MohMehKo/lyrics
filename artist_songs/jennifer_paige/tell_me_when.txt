I talk to you out loud
Driving south on Kings Road
I've got you in my coat here
Written down
I find new ways to want you
But I can't reach you
So I head downtown

It's forever later
You're so far away
As night becomes day
I remember the way you held me
Baby won't you

Tell me when so I keep believing
Tell me again I'm on your mind all the time
Tell me when, don't wanna lose this feeling
Tell me again when you'll be mine
When you'll be mine
Tell me when

Flying standby
On the redeye when you saw me
You left and I heard voices in my head
A happy accident that had to happen
A car crash in my bed

It's forever later
You're so far away
As night becomes day
I remember the way you held me
Baby won't you

Tell me when so I keep believing
Tell me again I'm on your mind all the time
Tell me when, don't wanna lose this feeling
Tell me again when you'll be mine
When you'll be mine
Tell me when

It's forever later
You're so far away
I remember the way you held me, baby

Tell me when so I keep believing
Tell me again I'm on your mind all the time
Tell me when, don't wanna lose this feeling
Tell me again when you'll be mine
When you'll be mine
Tell me when
