I read you wrong
You said you'd only be away a while
But the days turned into weeks
and the weeks into miles, baby why?
You could've told me you were tellin' me goodbye
Could've come clean and let me walk away in style

Funny thing is...
While I was missin' you
While I was figurin "what was I gonna do?"

I got wise
I got hip
I caught on to your tricks
I got over it real quick yeah baby
while you were gone
Now I'm cool
Can't you tell?
Feel so good about myself
Funny thing happened to me baby
While you were gone

You look surprised
Like no one ever left you and survived
But leavin' me alone 
Has kinda opened my eyes
Baby you, you gave me the time
To find somebody new
and I found strength inside of me I never knew

Funny thing is
While he was holding me
While he was showing me how it's supposed to be

I got wise
I got hip
I caught on to your tricks
I got over it real quick yeah baby
While you were gone
Now I'm cool
Can't you tell?
Feel so good about myself
Funny thing happened to me baby
While you were gone

Didn't break
Didn't cry
I just tell my head I'm fine
I learned how to say goodbye
While you were gone
I had time on my hands
Boy what don't you understand?
Funny thing happened to me baby
While you were gone

oh... oh...
while you were gone I learned how to get along
while he was gone I got strong

While he was holdin me
While he was showin me
how it's supposed to be, oh oh whoa

Didn't break
Didn't cry
I just tell my head I'm fine
I learned how to say goodbye
While you were gone
I had time on my hands
Boy what don't you understand?
Funny thing happened to me baby
While you were gone

I got wise
I got hip
I caught on to your tricks
I got over it real quick yeah baby
While you were gone
Now I'm cool
Can't you tell?
Feel so good about myself
Funny thing happened to me baby
While you were gone
