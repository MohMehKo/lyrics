Snow's falling, all around
It's like a winter, wonderland
I wasn't ready for the dark night's or the lonely
Days turn to years, but I still count on you to haunt me

Stay strong, don't melt down
What good will that do
Anybody now
They say it gets easier
What if I'm afraid of that?
Don't wanna lose, the memories you bring back

January, January
A bitter sweet, anniversary
Old friend, I must confess
I can't always say that it's good to see you
January, January
A bitter sweet anniversary

Anything to keep me company
To get me through this lonesome sting
Heartache comes and goes
Its tried to leave its mark on me
But it can't hurt ok more, ever come between me
And

January, January
A bitter sweet, anniversary
Old friend, I must confess
I can't always say that it's good to see you
Oh, January, January
A bitter sweet anniversary

And the world goes blind
And the world going blind
Hmmm...
