Go on, go on, go on
Go on and tell like it is
Don't want it sugarcoated
Oh, your kind of sweet leaves a bad taste in my mouth

So, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
You never say what's on your mind
It's like you're undercover
You know how to get your way without making a sound 

They're eating out of the palm of your hands
But they don't know it's all a show

Sugar sweet like honey baby
Say what they want to hear
'Cause everybody loves a candied baby
Making it loud and clear
What's on the tip of your tongue
Why are you playing dumb
Go on just spit it out

Go on, go on, go on
Take another step ahead
And climb on up the ladder
You'd do anything to get yourself to the top

Yeah, they're eating out of the palm of your hands
That's when you know it's time to go

Sugar sweet like honey baby
Say what they want to hear
'Cause everybody loves a candied baby
Making it loud and clear
What's on the tip of your tongue
Why are you playing dumb
Go on just spit it out

Never make a stand, take everything you can
Never make a stand, take everything you can

Sugar sweet like honey baby
Say what they want to hear
'Cause everybody loves a candied baby
Making it loud and clear
What's on the tip of your tongue
Why are you playing dumb
Go on just spit it out
