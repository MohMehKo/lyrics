Don't wanna cause a scene
I don't need anything from you now
But somehow
I found my way to you
Probably a dumb thing to do
Sometimes, you just gotta get it out

I never said I'm sorry
I'll never say it
You never said your sorry
You'll never say it

Years and years have come between the two of us (Forget me not)
We had it all to lose (Forget me not)
Fear has kept me quiet, and lonely nights (Forget me not)
Gotta tell you I still love you (Forget me not)
Forget me not
Forget me not

Played it out a million times
A movie in my mind
If only, that easy
Seeing all the different sides
Gotta make your story right this time
No time for regret

I never said I'm sorry
I'll never say it
You never said you're sorry
You'll never say it

Years and years have come between the two of us (Forget me not)
We had it all to lose (Forget me not)
Fear has kept me quiet, and lonely nights (Forget me not)
Gotta tell you I still love you (Forget me not)
Forget me not
Forget me not

If we could go back in time
Would we... change that night?
With everything that we know now
We admit no one was right

I'll never say I'm sorry
No, you'll never say you're sorry
I'll never say it

Years and years have come between the two of us (Forget me not)
We had it all to lose (Forget me not)
Fear has kept me quiet, and lonely nights (Forget me not)
Gotta tell you I still love you (Forget me not)
Forget me not
Forget me not
