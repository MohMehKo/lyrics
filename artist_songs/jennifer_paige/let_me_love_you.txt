I draw a heart shape on your cold window pane
To let you know I'm still outside
When we play hide and seek
I make myself easy for you to find
Let your guard down, let your secrets out
Keep em' closer than if they were mine
I'll leave the lights on, keep the car running
When you're ready, ready to drive

My love will wait, you don't have to shut me out
This love heartbreak is worth it if you figure out
L-l-let me love you, l-l-let me love you

I'll lean my head back on your chest
Almost hear the locks beat beneath your skin
I dream of X-Ray vision, and the key to break you open
A girl can still pretend
You're the kind of guy who only plays to win
I'll let you beat me to the finish line
I'm like the girl in a tower looking down at a man
That's too afraid to climb

My love will wait, you don't have to shut me out
This love heartbreak is worth it if you figure out
My love will wait, you don't have to shut me out
This love heartbreak is worth it if you figure out
L-l-let me love you, l-l-let me love you
L-l-let me love you l-l-let me love you

Love come near me now
Say you need me, say you need me
Love don't fear me now
Say you need me, say you need me
L-l-let me love you

My love will wait, you don't have to shut me out
This love heartbreak is worth it if you figure out
My love will wait, you don't have to shut me out
This love heartbreak is worth it if you figure out

L-l-let me love you
My love will wait (Oh, l-l-let me love you)
My love will wait (l-l-let me love you)
My love will wait (l-l-let me love you)
