Overloaded with questions unanswered 
What are we doing here 
In all this commotion 
With guarded emotions 
We're afraid to feel
In this world gone crazy 
I'm keeping you close to me
So love won't leave me here 

'Cause I'm prone to over-analyze 
My heart gets stuck in overdrive 
While I'm left standing by 
And I do love you 
I like to go with the flow 
Still I don't know which way I'm going 
But it's all better in the skies 
How I do love you 
I do love you 

I'm over-thinking, every motion 
Got my feet off the ground 
And I'll be heading 
In your direction 
So when it all comes down 

To a world gone hazy 
You'll be leading me safely 
Love won't leave me here 

'Cause I'm prone to over-analyze 
My heart gets stuck in overdrive 
While I'm left standing by 
And I do love you 
I like to go with the flow 
Still I don't know which way I'm going 
But it's all better in the skies 
How I do love you 
I do love you 

Don't stop you know that I'm needing you now 
Don't stop 'till I got my feet off the ground 
Can't stop this feeling, can't slow it down
