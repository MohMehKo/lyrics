Sometimes you just got to kick it into gear
When your grip keeps slippin' and your clutch is gone
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh and you're tired spinning your wheels on
Your brains front lawn

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh well keep your asphalt under sunny side up
A gas credit card and a giant coffee cup
The rest of your life is gonna find you here
Get up on the highway and kick it into gear

Kick it into gear, kick it into gear
That's the only way you're gonna get on out of here
Kick it into gear, kick it into gear
Sometimes you just got to kick it into gear

Had some money for a turbo drive
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh well it ain't the destination
It's the ride, ride, ride ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Put the heavy to the metal and grab onto the road

I hear your motor runnin', it's about to explode
Still be waitin' this time next year
Head on down the highway and kick it into gear

Kick it into gear, kick it into gear
That's the only way you're gonna get on out of here
Kick it into gear, kick it into gear
Sometimes you just got to kick it into gear

Kick it into gear, kick it into gear
That's the only way you're gonna get on out of here
Kick it into gear, kick it into gear
So if you want to yeah

Kick it into gear, kick it into gear
That's the only way you're gonna get on out of here
Kick it into gear, kick it into gear
Sometimes you just got to kick it into gear
