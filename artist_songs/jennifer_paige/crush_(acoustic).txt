See you blowing me a kiss
It doesn't take a scientist
To understand what's going on, baby
If you see something in my eye
Let's not overanalyze
Don't go too deep with it, baby

So let it be what it'll be
Don't make a fuss
And get crazy over you and me
Here's what I do
I'll play it loose
Not like we have a date with destiny

It's just a little crush
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I do depends on you, on you

It's raising my adrenaline
You're banging on a heart of tin
Don't make too much of it, baby
You say that we're forevermore
That's not what I'm looking for
All I can commit to is maybe

So let it be what it'll be
Don't make a fuss
And go crazy over you and me
Here's what I do
I'll play it loose
Not like we have a date with destiny

It's just a little crush
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I do depends on you
Oh, you

Vanilla skies
White picket fences in your eyes
A vision of you and me

It's just a little crush
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I do depends on you
Oh, you

Sha la la la
Sha la la la
Sha la la la
Sha la la la

It's just a little crush
Every time we touch
