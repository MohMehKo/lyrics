I can take you down to everywhere I go
Never want to take you down that low
Been starin' out my window
Into negative space
On the pavement from the elevator

Down the corner shop to buy the paper
Had a premonition you would be there too
No way not today
It's just more bad news

I want to be vapor
Want to rise above the year
I want to be steamy
And dry up all my tears
Cause with my head in the clouds
I'd be light upon my heels
I want to be vapor
I want to be vapor
And disappear sometimes

My heart is heavy
And I feel I'm sinking in
My sister tells me that I spread myself too thin
Feel like I'm standing in a plaster mold of me
What I have is not contagious
I see a smile on a passing stranger
Think to follow them to see where they go all day
Wanna know how it is they get that way

I want to be vapor
Want to rise above the year
I want to be steamy
And dry up all my tears
Cause with my head in the clouds
I'd be light upon my heels
I want to be vapor
I want to be vapor
And disappear sometimes

I could take you down to everywhere I go
But I never want to take you down that low
Oh no Oh no

I want to be vapor
Want to rise above the year
I want to be steamy
And dry up all my tears
Cause with my head in the clouds
I'd be light upon my heels
I want to be vapor
I want to be vapor
And disappear sometimes
