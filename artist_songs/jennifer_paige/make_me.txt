You look so confident
The way you work the room
Like you're heaven sent
Everybody checking you
Something about it baby
Keepin' me amused
Hate to admit it but I
Kind of like your attitude

Things that you do and the things that
you say
Gotta be for real if you want me to stay
Think that I'll jump if you want me to play
Well, you gotta do better than that

Make me
Give you everything I've got
A reason to let you in my private thoughts
Take me
To a higher place where I've never been
The way that no one else can
Make me

I see the wheels are turning
You've always been the best
You think you're the first
You better second guess
Before we get to that
You gotta go like this
Show me I'm on top of
Your most wanted list

Things that you do and the things that
you say
Gotta be for real if you want me to stay
Think that I'll jump if you want me to play
Well, you gotta do better than that

Make me
Give you everything I've got
A reason to let you in my private thoughts
Take me
To a higher place where I've never been
The way that no one else can
Make me

No easy come
No easy go
The way to my heart is through my soul
I'm giving you
The simple fact
Think that I'll jump if you want me to play
Well, you gotta do better than that

Make me
Give you everything I've got
A reason to let you in my private thoughts
Take me
To a higher place where I've never been
The way that no one else can
Make me
