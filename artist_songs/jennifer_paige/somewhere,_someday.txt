When clouds roll above you start to pour
And all of your doubts rage like a storm
And you don't know who you are anymore
Let me help you find what you been searching for

[Chorus:]
Somewhere there's a field and a river
You can let your soul run free
Someday let me be the giver
Let me bring you peace
Somewhere there's a break in the weather
Where your heart and spirit go free
Someday it'll be for the better
Let me bring you peace

I know you think no one sees
The weight on your shoulders
But you can't fool me
And aren't you tired of standing so tall
Let me be the one to catch you when you fall

[Chorus]

Let me bring you joy, let me bring you peace
Take the tears that you cry, trust them to me
Let me give you heart, and hope
Be the one constant love that you've never known
