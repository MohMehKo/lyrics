Some people sit around all day long
while some folks never look back
Every pirates got his treasure map
just like every train's got it's track
Time won't wait for you
so why bother waitin' to rave?

You can rave about it, you can rage about it
you can jump for joy or complain about it
You can scream or shout it, smile big or frown it
Call up the cops to see who's to blame about it

You can rave about it, you can rage about it
You can jump up for joy or complain about it
You can scream or shout it, smile big or frown it
Call up the cops to see who's to blame about it

The power,
The power of destiny
