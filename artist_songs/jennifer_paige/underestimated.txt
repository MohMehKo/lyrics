You've underestimated, you've underestimated
You've underestimated me again
You've underestimated, you've underestimated
You've underestimated me again

Hot shit, you thought I'd quite, and I'd just sit back in the corner
Mouth shut, had enough, held my tongue, can't wait no longer
I'll be seeing you one way of another
And when I do, gonna say that we should together never

Wink and a smile, it's been a while
With every day I'm for the better
I song my song, I still remember
I'll be seeing you one way or another

You've underestimated, you've underestimated
You've underestimated me again
You've underestimated, you've underestimated
You've underestimated me again

Where have you been, you know me when
You say you know, you knew, whatever
Give in, better call a friend
Before you're all alone and weathered

I'll be seeing you, yeah
One way or another
I know you know the truth
Even if it's under the covers

You've underestimated, you've underestimated
You've underestimated me again
You've underestimated, you've underestimated
You've underestimated me again

I'm gonna break out, let it all go
So turn around, I'll say it slow, baby
Say it loud, what you already know
I'm not about to let you take control

You've underestimated, you've underestimated
You've underestimated me again
You've underestimated, you've underestimated
You've underestimated me again
