Feel the beat, move your feet to the music
Feel the love, gotta love, gotta feel it

Tonight forget about your troubles
Feelin' so right, let the music take you til you're so high 
When nothing seems to make sense, make sense

One more hit, take another trip into the abyss
Wash your pain away with every sip
While all your dreams get wasted, wasted

Feel the love, gotta love, gotta feel it
People round the world - all around the world
Gotta believe, believe in something, something
Hear the beat, stomp your feet to the music
Sounds so sweet
All you gotta do, you gotta listen, listen

Never too late, pick up all the pieces, so what's the wait
There's no use in planning the great escape
There's so much to live for, don't you want more

So take time, everywhere you turn they're blowin' your mind
Sit back and relax, just hit the rewind
It's the right time to start over, just start over

Feel the love, gotta love, gotta feel it
People round the world - all around the world
Gotta believe, believe in something, something
Hear the beat, stomp your feet to the music
Sounds so sweet
All you gotta do, you gotta listen, listen

All around the world, feel the love
All around the world, feel alive
Feel the beat, stomp your feet to the music, feel alive
Feel the love, gotta love, gotta feel it, feel alive

Feel the love, gotta love, gotta feel it
People round the world - all around the world
Gotta believe, believe in something, something
Hear the beat, stomp your feet to the music
Sounds so sweet
All you gotta do, you gotta listen, listen

Feel the love, gotta love, gotta feel it
People round the world - all around the world
Gotta believe, believe in something, something
Hear the beat, stomp your feet to the music
Sounds so sweet
All you gotta do, you gotta listen, listen
