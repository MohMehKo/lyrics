Don't know what you intended
Am I just part of your game
Boy, you started a fire
I can't identify it
You're only fanning my flame
It's the rule of desire

Don't keep me waiting here for your love
Come and show me what you're made of

Stay the night
And I'll decide
If it's right
Cause I won't wait forever baby
Stay the night
Come inside
Show me why
I should let you
Stay the night

Use your imagination
Don't treat me like the rest
Show me you'll do it better
This kind of situation
Requires only the best
Boy, it's now or never

I'm just waiting here for your love
Come and show me what you're made of

Stay the night
And I'll decide
If it's right
Cause I won't wait forever baby
Stay the night
Come inside
Show me why
I should let you
Stay the night

This could go either way
So don't just stand there at my door
Cause I can't
No, I can't fight this feeling anymore
No more

Stay the night
And I'll decide
If it's right
Cause I won't wait forever baby
Stay the night
Come inside
Show me why
I should let you
Stay the night
