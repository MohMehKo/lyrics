Home, home is where the heart is
If you can stay, hmm
Remember when, you said you'd give your best?
Did you forget, how could you forget?

We used to love like teenagers, you said
I was the most beautiful thing you'd ever seen
But now you're lookin' right through
You're looking right through me, you would do

I can't keep you here
I can't keep you here
I don't want to
I can't keep you here
I can't keep you here
I don't want to
I don't want to
I don't want to

Home, home is where the hurt is
While you wait, oh
I can't pretend (no I can't pretend)
No I can't keep pretending (oh no I can't)
This isn't over, we both know it

Cause there you go out wonderin' 
don't even wanna think about where you've been
Save your breath, go to bed, with empty promises

I can't keep you here
I can't keep you here
I don't want to (I don't want to)
I can't keep you here
I can't keep you here
I don't want to (I don't want to)
I don't want to

God know I keep coming back
[?]
God knows I do anything 
if I thought you would know
God knows I keep coming back
[?]
God knows I do anything 
if I thought you would know

Hmmm....
