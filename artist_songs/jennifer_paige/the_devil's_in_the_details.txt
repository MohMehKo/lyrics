Don't lie to me, shy away
Take another minute
Get the story straight
You've known for too long
I wouldn't ask you for more than I know you have
Gonna take it all, if it's gonna last
We hold on til it's gone

You make it so hard to love you
Make it so hard to
Even when you're close, it's like I've lost you
It's like I start to
What did I get myself into
I promised to be with you
But the devil's in the details
Babe I never knew
You'd make it so hard to love you
Make it so hard to
Make it so hard to love you
So hard to...

Don't make me
Dumb it down
Try to make you feel safe & sound
Til you know what you want
I'm not gonna hold my breath quietly
Wait around for you to see that's it's gone
Is that what you want

You make it so hard to love you
Make it so hard to
Even when you're close, it's like I've lost you
It's like I start to
What did I get myself into
I promised to be with you
But the devil's in the details
Babe I never knew
You'd make it so hard to love you
Make it so hard to
Make it so hard to love you
So hard to...

Reach out to things that are bound to break
Dig our heels and make mistakes
Wade in the water til we're under the waves
Reach out to things that are bound to break
