We used to be happy
We used to make sense
We had everybody
Believing again
We used to stick together
Everywhere we went
Always in to each other
So over confident

I don't know if you've ever fallen apart
Or ever had a broken heart 

I don't wanna be there I don't wanna be free
It's wasted, it's wasted on me
I don't wanna be scared, why can't you agree
It's wasted, it's wasted on me

We used to be something
Everybody saw that
Said it was forever
On the right track
I don't know how it changed
But I want it back
'Cause I never saw this coming
Never thought you could do that

I don't know if you've ever fallen apart
Or ever really had a heart

I don't wanna be there I don't wanna be free
It's wasted, it's wasted on me
I don't wanna be scared, why can't you agree
It's wasted, it's wasted on me

I don't know it all
I want it all
Just wanna be
Back to you and me
Don't wanna go, but here I go

I don't wanna be there I don't wanna be free
It's wasted, it's wasted on me
I don't wanna be scared, why can't you agree
It's wasted, it's wasted on me
