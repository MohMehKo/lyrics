Stare into God's face
Trying to find my place
Keeps avoiding me
That trace of who I want to be
Suffered injustice
Don't know what trust is
It slipped away
But I trust I'll find it someday

[Chorus:]
Been disconnected embraced and rejected
Either way it doesn't bother me
But I keep moving doing what I'm doing
Guess that's the way it's s'posed to be
Who, what, where, and why
Voices walk with me at night
Who, what, where, and why
Questions of my life

Angel on my shoulder
Winds blow colder
And I'm afraid
They might blow my angel away
I'm the dead ringer
There goes the chick singer 
What they don't know
Is what they'll never see

[Chorus]

But I keep movin' doin' what I'm doin'
And all the fear I've held inside
Has left me with some peace of mind
And now love's knockin' at my door
That's how I know there's something more
