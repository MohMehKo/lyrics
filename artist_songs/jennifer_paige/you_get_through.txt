Thought my pain could not be penetrated
My defenses activated
Like a heart that was laminated
And completely sealed

But you're just like a beam of freedom
Pure white light in faded jeans
I love the way you see me baby
The way you make me feel

You, you get through
Even with my walls in place
Even with my poker face
And all those little girl games I play
You, you get through
And you never let me down
Never disappointed
With the love you've found
You get through

Not in my wildest imagination
Did I have this expectation
Now I'm having the revelation
I am not immune

Cause when you hold me I surrender
I am yours
Yours forever
I love the way you love me baby
The things you do, you do

You, you get through
Even with my walls in place
Even with my poker face
And all those little girl games I play
You, you get through
And you never let me down
Never disappointed
With the love you've found
You get through

From the bottom of the heart of me
I feel this love
Every single little part of me
Is opening up

You, you get through
Even with my walls in place
Even with my poker face
And all those little girl games I play
You, you get through
And you never let me down
Never disappointed
With the love you've found
You get through
