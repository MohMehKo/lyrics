We're forced to run under the gun
We give, we take, we make mistakes

We do our best to get by
Oh, its a messy life, messy life
Beaten up on the inside
We try, we try, we try

As long as I've got a heartbeat
As long as I got air to breathe
Long as you're here next to me, that's all I need
Oh it's the little things that give meaning, to the madness
Oh it's the little things that give meaning, to the madness

We push, too far, and tempt the house of cards
Like we've got nothing to lose
I'm whole when I'm with you

We do our best to get by
Oh, it's a messy life, messy life
Beaten up on the inside
We try, we try, we try

As long as I've got a heartbeat
As long as I've got air to breathe
Long as you're here next to me, that's all I need
Oh it's the little things that give meaning, to the madness
Oh it's the little things that give meaning, to the madness

Didn't see you coming
Now it's all or nothing
Didn't see you coming
You know what you were doing
(as long as you're here next to me, that's all I need)

As long as I've got a heartbeat
As long as I've got air to breathe
Long as you're here next to me, that's all I need
Oh it's the little things that give meaning, to the madness
Oh it's the little things that give meaning, to the madness
Oh it's the little things that give meaning, to the madness
