If you call it lonely to be so alone
Nobody calling and nobody home, then I'm lonely
That's just what I am

If you call it ugly to squint at the world
Lie in on Monday and dress like a girl, then I'm ugly
That's just what I am

[Chorus:]
What can I do to make you feel it like I do
And be happy living under the moon?
How do I say in your way, why do it safely?
Cause maybe this is our last living day

If you call it stupid to cover my ear
When everyone's screaming but nobody's near, then I'm stupid
That's just what I am

If you call it crazy to sit up and let
My love be dialed in through your TV set, then I'm crazy
That's just what I am

[Chorus]

If you think it's creepy to lay on the ground
Lay there and lay there and wait to be found, then I'm creepy
That's just what I am
