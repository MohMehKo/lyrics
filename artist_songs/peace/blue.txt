Whatever I need to say I'll say
Wherever I need to go I'll go, if you stay
You used to be happy, you used to be you
Maybe it is me turning you blue

[Pre-Chorus:]
Tell me I'm a fool, tell me I'm too young
Baby you're so cool, in between two lungs

[Chorus x2:]
I feel like I'm dying
I feel like I'm dying
I feel like I'm dying, I do

Everyone treats you like a king
Royally pretty when you sing to me
Everyone's dizzy, everyone's dumb
Turning you blue, baby it's wrong

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x2]

I feel, I feel, I feel like I'm dying, I do
[x2]

Blue baby confusing me
Your slippy soul is bruising me
Every hurt is healing me
Sensational, but move the way you feel about it
You know the things you'd rather see
Your sunny days have gone and been
Blue dreaming that I'm standing still but honey
My stream won't flow downhill

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x2]

I feel, I feel, I feel like I'm dying, I do
[x2]
