The creators of man
Were calm, kind and nice
But nature demands
That we fuck, eat and fight

If you're not macho,
Then try to be funny
If you can't fuck or fight
Then I hope that you're hungry

Do you feel like a man,
'cause you got blood on your hands?
If we're living in a man's world,
I'm a girl
I'm a girl
I'm a girl

When I was in Digbeth
I felt so alone
I'm not sure that violence was born in my bones
I'm not loud or scary
No red-blooded Ares
Put a snake round my neck,
'Cause I'm not gonna wear it

Do you feel like a man,
'cause you got blood on your hands?
If we're living in a man's world,
I'm a girl
I'm a girl
I'm a girl

Do you feel like a man,
'cause you got blood on your hands?
If we're living in a man's world,
I'm a girl
I'm a girl
I'm a girl

I don't feel like a man
I don't feel like a man
