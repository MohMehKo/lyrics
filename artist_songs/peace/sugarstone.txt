Little brick brain, are you ok?
Cos the world don't wanna spin today
There's a change in the order
Must be something in the water
'Cause nothing really tastes the same

It's not about the generation
It's not about the education
We don't need to think today
'Cause you and me can slip away, you know
You're my sugarstone

I heard your soul
Kinda lost control
But you're here now and you never want to go
'Cause baby in the dark
You vibe too hard
And it feels as though you're steaming in the snow

It's not about the generation
It's not about our education
We don't need to think today
'Cause you and me can slip away, you know
You're my sugar

You feel it in your brittle bones
You feel alive or feel alone
I really really need you to know

I know you've got a heavy little heart
And it seems as though your future is the past
And though your feet are made of lead
You've always had a feather head
You know, you know

It's not about the generation
It's no more need for education
We don't need to think today
'Cause you and me, we'll wash away, you know
You're my sugarstone
