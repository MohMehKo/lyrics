Maybe it's me that's changed, or the TV that's changed
Your children are growing up, your children have slowly started
Learning, twisting, turning inside out
The 90's were cool, I've heard all about
The 80's were better, I have no doubt
The blue screen has bent

[Chorus:]
I'm just trying to change the world that you live in
O You
Trying to make it better for your children
O You

Your children are playing up for reason unknown to us
It seems that they might've sussed that when you inherit something
Broken, twisted, pillaged raped and burned
You won't have a devil's chance to learn
That breaking a finger having fun is tragic enough when

[Chorus x2]

Hot lover, chemically blessed
Soul brother, spiritual mess
Hypnotizer, not another six string sympathiser

[Chorus x2]
