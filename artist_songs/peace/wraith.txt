Close your eyes, my leather hearted boys
It's such a waste, cut your silky noise
Ooh, I don't wanna see you
Ooh, I don't wanna see you

You could be my ice age sugar
You lay me down and make me shiver
Blow me like a floating feather
We'll be dark, we'll be dark, we'll be dark forever.

It’s no surprise, she'd spiky jagged claws
She’s such a wraith, a lady of the sword
Ooh, I don't wanna see you
Ooh, 'cause I don't wanna see you

Ooh, I don't wanna see you

You could be my ice age sugar
You lay me down and make me shiver
Blow me like a floating feather,
We'll be dark, we'll be dark, we'll be dark.

You could be my ice age sugar
You lay me down and make me shiver
Blow me like a floating feather
We'll be dark, we'll be dark, we'll be dark forever.
