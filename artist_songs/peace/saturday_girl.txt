Saturday girl drifting around
Beauty of Earth embodied as found

[Chorus:]
Saturday girl
Saturday girl

Heavenly she saunters around
Her perfect meander the drift of a cloud
Pavements are curving, they buckle and warp
She's effortlessly turning my world as she walks

[Chorus x2]

The silk of her skin, gentle as snow
Legs always walking with somewhere to go
Blood may be blue but lipstick is red
Saturday girl you're killing me dead

[Chorus x3]
