Every season time dictates that something has to change
It's hard to catch your eyeline when you're staring into space
Turn and run the time has come to slowly walk away
Some say separate pathways sometimes turn and meet again

[Chorus:]
It's a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely life
But only for a moment at a time
It's not what fate intended
But it's how it ended up
I hope someday you will find someone to love

Truth be told that we grow old and live without regret
Stop and stare, pretend to care, remember you'll forget
Looking back at photographs, gorgeous, young, in white and black
Perfect skin, pure within but heaven wouldn't let you in

[Chorus]

Leaky eye'd goodbyes should be reserved for those more brave
If it's to be our history, the final memory made
Haunting is the thought that lingers long after you go:
Maybe all this happened so the both of us could grow
