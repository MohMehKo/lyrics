Yesterday I woke up, on the wrong side of your bed
I kept my eyes shut, but I saw you in my head
Time isn't frozen, it's melted in the sun
You're like a poison, you linger in my lungs

People tell me things about you, like you're toxic, it's no good
I'd never wanna break that daze, cut loose or blow away

All I gotta do, all I gotta do is forget you
All I gotta do, all I gotta do is forget you

Take it or leave it
We're all gonna hurt our friends
Want it or need it
Some good things never end

People tell me things about you, like you're toxic, it's no good
I'd never wanna break that daze, cut loose or blow away

All I gotta do, all I gotta do is forget you
All I gotta do, all I gotta do is forget you
All I gotta do, all I gotta do is forget you
Yeah, all I gotta do, all I gotta do is forget you

I wanna blow away and sleep until we're dead
Stop trying to fill the heart shaped hole left in your chest
I wanna hesitate, blow away and celebrate
All around the world, people seem to have heard

All I gotta do, all I gotta do is forget you
Yeah, all I gotta do, all I gotta do is forget you
Yeah, all I gotta do, all I gotta do is forget
Yeah, all I gotta do, all I gotta do is forget you
