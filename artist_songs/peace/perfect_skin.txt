You're so clever
I'm so dumb
I need less of me in me
And more of you in me

You're so healthy
I'm so junk
I need less of me in me
And more of you in me

So gimme, gimme, gimme a little bit of you
Let me have your body and talk like you do
Let me be as gorgeous, as stylish, as rich
I wanna, I wonder, I worry, I wish

I wish I had perfect skin
I wish I was tall and thin
I wish I wore gorgeous clothes
With muscles surrounding my bones
I wish I had perfect skin

You're so gorgeous
I'm so grim
I need less of me in me
And more of you in me

You're just perfect
I'm so hid
I need less of me in me
And more of you in me

Gimme, gimme, gimme a little bit of you
Let me have your body and talk like you do
Let me be as gorgeous, as stylish, as rich
I wanna, I wonder, I worry, I wish

I wish I had perfect skin
I wish I was tall and thin
I wish I wore gorgeous clothes
And muscles surrounding my bones
I wish I had perfect skin

I wish I had perfect skin
I wish I was tall and thin
I wish I wore gorgeous clothes
With muscles surrounding my bones
And if I had perfect skin
Would I feel pure within?
I wish I had perfect skin

Your superiority overtly makes me worry I'm not worthy
Have you seen me? Have you heard me?
All I need from you is...
