How do you do it? How do you know
To keep on walking when there's nowhere to go?
The man on the news, he said "Try not to be scared
Blood, Love and Terror. Next the Weather"

[Pre-Chorus:]
Generation strange's general ache and pain
Is pressure from the weight of all the satellites in space
But you never let it crush, even when you should
Tell me how you do it, how do you do it so good?

[Chorus x2:]
How do you do it?
How do you do it?
How do you do it so good?

The man on the moon looked down to a surprise
Earth wasn't round it was a square in disguise
He looked to the stars and saw chocolate Mars
And poor Venus a razor blade, Saturn a Sega game

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x2]

Aching aching everywhere
Do it effortless with charm and gab
Sticky fingers, bone and flab

[Chorus]

Generation strange's general ache and pain
Is pressure from the weight of all the satellites in space
But you never let it crush, even when you should
Tell me how you do it so good
