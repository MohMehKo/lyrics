Welcome little teethers
Welcome to a world
Where Bitcoins pay for beatings
And diamonds pay for girls
So go find all the pennies
The ones that people ditch
You're going to be happy
You're going to be rich

Money, do you need it?
Do you eat it when you're hungry?
Does it taste good?

The man who’s made of money
Was terrible to kiss
Not because he’s sloppy
Because his paper lips
Stuck to you on contact
And as you cease they rip
You hear the world is spinning
It’s not the coin that flips

Money, do you need it?
Do you eat it when you're hungry?
Does it taste good?

Find me something new to chew on
Grinding anything ‘cause all I want is everything but settling
Take strong
And the writing on the paper wall
The letter on the filthy floor

Is anybody happy?
Growing slowly up.
You were never happy
I was not enough

Supersize me
Nepotise me
Open wide me
Poise inside me
[?]
Inside the box
[?]

Money, do you need it?
Do you eat it when you're hungry?
Does it taste good?
