I can taste it on your breath, it's running through your veins
It never seemed so dense, blood don't taste the same
I'm idling through the dunes, swallowing the sand
Slowly starts to bruise, the sun is in your hand

It seems like everybody's got their own little lie
She stole my mind through the ocean's eye
And it seems that she only learned to read between the lines
Across my heart if you hope to die

I can say it's clear, just ask me what I saw
Crash in from a window, just open up the door
People on the mantelpiece in my ocean's eye
I don't want you to be hurt but all you do is cry

It seems like everybody's got their own little lie
She stole my mind with the ocean's eye
And it seems that she only learned to read between the lines
Across my heart if you hope to die

It seems like everybody's got their own little lie
She stole my mind with the ocean's eye
And it seems that she only learned to read between the lines
Across my heart if you hope to die
