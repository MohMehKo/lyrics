I need someone to love me

[Chorus x2:]
I need someone, I need someone, I need someone to
Love me
I need someone, I need someone, I need someone to
Love me here

Cause sleepless I can dream
But be an Adam without Eve
I need somebody please, please, please

I can lay around and power down and let life do how it do
But breaking heads and shaking beds won't turn water into you

[Chorus]

I can deal with the drain
Be a pill without a pain
A remedy for feeling lonely
It's a tiny little world
But you still feel close

[Chorus]
