In the morning, in the evening, in the night
We'll be talking, we'll be teething, we'll be right

[Pre-Chorus:]
Tomorrow I'm leaving your flirty ways and the dirty days
I'm feeling bohemian and free and stuff
I know because I know

[Chorus:]
In the morning, in the morning
I will fly away, fly away
In the morning, in the morning
So flirt with me, flirting USA
Flirting USA
Flirting USA

Who's the guy there? Does he know me? Does he care?
Who's his girlfriend? She's so pretty
But she's staring through me, caring crudely

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
