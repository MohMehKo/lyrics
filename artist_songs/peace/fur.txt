It appears darling I'm helpless, cause I don't look a thing like Elvis
Am I two decades a baby? Or almost slightly crazy?
Help me
Help me please

[Chorus:]
Nothing matters when you're wearing fur
I can't keep myself away from her
And I can't believe wearing forgery feels so real

There's wars too dark to understand and someone's blood on someone's hands
I can't afford the train or bus cause I spent my money on stupid stuff
Tell me
Maybe please

[Chorus:]
Nothing matters when you're wearing fur
I can't keep myself away from her
And I can't believe trouble skin deep feels so real

I know that all the troubles that you ever had to have
Would kill you if they could
Maybe they can, maybe they should

[Chorus]
