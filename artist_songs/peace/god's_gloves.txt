All you ever wanted was an easy way in
All you ever wanted were material things
All you ever wanted was a friend who could sing
All you ever wanted was everything

[Pre-Chorus:]
Maybe you've slowly started losing your grip
Maybe the piece has slowly started to fit

[Chorus:]
All you ever wanted was everything
In God's gloves you'd do terrible things
Snow won't fall black for you because you want it to, alright

All you ever wanted was a fist in the fight
All you ever wanted was love at first sight
All you ever wanted was a body sublime
All you ever wanted was the easiest life

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
