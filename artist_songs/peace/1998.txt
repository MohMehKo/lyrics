Long ago the golden glow would bleach all of the buildings
Not for years, not since we were children
The easy dream to float downstream
It gets harder when you’re half way
[?] your years, open ears
When you say that one day
We’ll wash away
Wash away, wash away
And never ever break the daze
Wash away, wash away

It’s spectacular
How you suck my blood
Baby, you’re Dracula
It’s oracular
How you say that one day
We’ll wash away
Wash away, wash away
And never ever break the daze
Wash away, wash away

[?] your years, open ears
When you say that one day
We’ll wash away
Wash away, wash away
And never ever break the daze
Wash away, wash away
