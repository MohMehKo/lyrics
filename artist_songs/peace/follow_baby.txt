I’m scared to death and maybe
A faithless bribe could save me
A touch, a bruise too easy
She stole the seeds to see me

Her hair it bleeds and bleeds for you
As blood runs east
She’d lay the fees
And offers please, she offers

Follow baby, we're going to live forever baby
Follow baby, we'll go deep, deep, deep, deep

She’s scared to see, so humble
No food to eat, we follow
But after sleep we’re into
The forest field, she said

Follow baby, we're going to live forever baby
Follow baby, we'll go deep, deep, deep, deep
