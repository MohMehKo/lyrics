From the moment that I wake up
To the minute that I fall asleep I run the risk
Of dreaming a life and living a dream and you're just a myth

[Pre-Chorus:]
It's not too good to be true, it's too good to be you
And I wonder when I'm sleeping, maybe it's too far to fetch
Kinda sweet but a mess, just trying to be cool

[Chorus x2:]
You make me feel like
You make me feel like
You make me feel imaginary

Too stark to move, I'm frozen
Paralysed by your groove, I'm poisoned
Hold me up on a crutch when I'm broken
Fix me sweet with a touch now I know

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x4]

[Chorus x4]
