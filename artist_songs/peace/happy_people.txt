All you happy people let me know
How you do it, how you keep for so long
I'm a bad computer, slow to load
I disconnected from you when I learned to learn

[Chorus:]
Do you feel colder?
Now you spent the summer again
Slowly getting older
Were you even happy then
Sometimes I feel like we're made out of stone
Trying to move but there's nowhere to go

All you happy people where'd you go?
When the season leaves you all alone
Patience has no virtue, it never had
I never tried to hurt you, you owe me that

[Chorus]

Where did all the happy people go?
