From the belly of the jungle, to the bottom of the sea
You're a river in Congo, just a heart in ecstasy
From the forest in Arden where I reside, blood will be blood
Back in Arden you twist and pry for blood to be

You vibe so hard, and you live this forever

We spit blood at the sun, we spit blood in the ocean
We spit blood at the sun, we spit blood in the ocean

As we plunge into the ocean the waves they pull us down
For a moment I'm open for blood to be

You vibe so hard, and you live this forever

We spit blood at the sun, we spit blood in the ocean
Spit blood at the sun, spit blood in the ocean
