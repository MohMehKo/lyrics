I get the feeling it was different here
Before we came along

Another young man murdered on my TV there
Seems so far from my comfy chair
The world isn't good the world ain't bad
The world ain't happy and the world ain't sad
The thing about the world is it's gone mad

(The thing about the world is...)

I get the feeling it was different here
Before we came along
Everybody's talking 'bout the good old days
How could they all be wrong?

The thing about the world is it's gone mad
Only world that we've ever had
The only world that we can use
It's big and round and it's got the blues
(The thing about the world is...)
The world isn't good the world ain't bad
The world ain't happy, the world ain't sad
The thing about the world is it's gone mad

(The thing about the world is...)

I get the feeling it was different here
Before we came along
Everybody's talking 'bout the good old days
How could they all be wrong?

In a world gone mad...

Business man sittin' on a big empire
Only took one day to set Rome on fire
Food on the table in the lucky cases
Sweet expressions on the children's faces
(The thing about the world is...)
The world isn't good the world ain't bad
The world ain't happy and the world ain't sad
The thing about the world is it's gone mad

(The thing about the world is...)

I get the feeling it was different here
Before we came along
Everybody's talking 'bout the good old days
How could they all be wrong?..
