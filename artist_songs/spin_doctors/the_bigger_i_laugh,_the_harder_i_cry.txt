Oh I know you're only
Heavy with your gold
You drag your feet so slowly
Like you hate to go
The more I walk on eggshells
The more I step on nails
I got a million plans
But each one fails

I'd rather you treat me like I treat you (I treat you)
Than me treat you the way you tend to do

Because I love the way you like me
I'd like you to love me so
I can see your heart
Is hunting for a place to go
The more I learn to hover
The less I learn to fly
The bigger I laugh
The harder I cry

I'd rather you treat me like I treat you (I treat you)
Than me treat you the way you tend to do

The bigger I laugh
The harder I cry...

Oh I know you're lonely
Your picture tells me so
You drag your feet so slowly
Like you hate, hate to go
The more I learn to live
The more I'd hate to die
The bigger I laugh
The harder I cry

I'd rather you treat me like I treat you (I treat you)
Than me treat you the way you tend to do

The bigger I laugh
The harder I cry...
