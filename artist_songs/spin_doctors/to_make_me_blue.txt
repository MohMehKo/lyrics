Oh, it's you, I love the things you do
To make me blue
Oh, it's true, I love the things you do
To make me blue

To make me blue
Oh, to make me blue
Oh, to make me blue
Oh, to make me blue

Oh, it's me, you love to watch me speed
Across the sea
Oh, I'm free, I love the way it's all
I need to be
To make blue....
