Woke up this morning
The vision in my head
Looks so good
I flipped right back to bed

Stream run to the ocean
Ocean run down to the sea
If the river was whiskey
You'd have no trouble drowning me

Haven't felt this good
Since I don't know when
Whatever bit ends up dead
Wanna do it all again

Stream run to the ocean
Ocean run down to the sea
If the river was whiskey
You'd have no trouble drowning me

Dollar in my pocket
Good girl on my arm
Nothing gonna stop me short
Of an atomic bomb

Stream run to the ocean
Ocean run down to the sea
If the river was whiskey
You'd have no trouble drowning me

I feel so fine
Mama, please don't make me blue
If you ever leave me
I'm gonna come with you

Stream run to the ocean
Ocean run down to the sea
And if the river was whiskey
You'd have no trouble drowning me

And if the river was whiskey
You'd have no trouble drowning me
