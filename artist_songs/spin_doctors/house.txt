This is my house where I hang around
As soon as I get up, I start to get down
You don't need a place to stay
Our house is any old place we play

This is my house if you don't like it
just get outta
get outta
get outta

Came up so fast gave me the bends
Now I'm staring into a camera lens
From rags to riches and back again
But this is my house and I say when

This is my house.....

This is my house you know that's final
It's made of plastic, magnetic tape and vinyl
This is my house now doncha know
We move in every time you turn on your radio

This is my house....
