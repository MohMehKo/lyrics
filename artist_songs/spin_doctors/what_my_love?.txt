I don't know what my love supposed to do 
I don't know what my love supposed to do 
Well, that's how I fell when I put my arms around you 

Four walls, five beers, a burp and one t.v. 
Four walls, five beers, a burp and one t.v. 
That's all you left, mama, of my happy home and me 

I don't know what my love supposed to do 
I don't know what my love supposed to do 
Well, that's how I feel when you put your hands on me
