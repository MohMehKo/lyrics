The streets are lined with gold
The cheese is full of mold
Oh, come into the fold with me 
Global domination
While it sparks my imagination
It kills the vegetation
Ant it's not my cup of tea

The stairs are high and winding
My brother is divining
The empire is declining
But the wine is old
It's never sweet enough
And a little too tough
And they play a bit too rough
And they talk a little bit too cold

Say there's another color
Just say it on a bet
You know it's true
Though you haven't heard it yet
They're playing it for keeps
Like pieces on a board
You know it's true
Though you haven't heard before

Welcome to the decline
It's going just fine
It's good for the wine 
And it's good for the forces
You can run but you can't hide
And beggars would ride
If they had the horses

If wishes were horses 
Beggars would ride
If wishes were horses
Beggars would ride
If wishes were horses
Beggars would ride
If wishes were horses
Oh, beggars would ride
Beggars would ride

The carousel is burning
The model's eyes are yearning
The tables aren't turning
But the lunch is free
And it's never cheap enough
And it's always the same stuff
And they forever call your bluff
And forever get their fee

Say there's another color.....

There is no limitation 
Set upon this nation
What is our station 
And relationship?
What about the pollution
And the constitution?
What is the purpose
Of this burning branch I grip?

If wishes were horses 
Beggars would ride........
