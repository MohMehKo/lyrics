We were on a vacation
In a turbulent nation
Guess it's part my fault
For not hauling you down
To the train station
There's no ring on your finger
Fly away don't you linger
It's simply absurd
To think she's a bird
Just because she's a singer
Don't you bring her round
Don't you bring her round
Don't you bring her round
Don't you bring her round
Does it make you wonder
Why the innocent blunder?
When you sit in the sun
You should just have fun
Not summon the thunder
She's just like the mama
Generating a trauma
And I don't see why
You're still willing to try
When it's all just a drama
Don't you bring her round...
She's a taker, not a giver
And I can't believe you're still with her
She would've sold you down the river
And I can't believe you're still with her
We were on a vacation
In an idyllic nation
Guess it's part my fault
For not pouring the salt
On your frustration
You're afraid to be lonely
Well you're not the only
Better to feel the pain
And to run through the rain
Than to live like a phoney
Don't you bring her round...
