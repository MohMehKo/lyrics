I've held your hand and sunk your ships
And I can read our future in the whiskey on your lips
Watch this ice a-melting; cool glass magnify my palms
And from the church on Sunday evening comes the sifted sound of psalms

Things they go and then come around to stops
Now my baby? just a breeze through the treetops

Glass in my hand, my back to the door
My one consolation is I ain't your man anymore

The Drop

Oh, I worry just about the drop
Oh, I worry just about the drop
'Cause it's not the fall that kills you,
But, the sudden stop

Machiavelli on the door
The shogun dropped his chopsticks in the bowl
Oh, you might be a pastor, but you never pay the toll

I'm flippin' from left to right
Oh, I'm flippin' like a moth tonight
I could never ask your baby,
I'll wish for you tonight
I'll wish for you

I worry just about the drop
I worry about the drop
'Cause it's not the fall that kills you,
It's that sudden stop
That sudden stop, now

Is she alligator
Yeah, she's a crocodile
She got that ancient [?]
That's just hanging out of her smile

When she called you at the keyhole, brother
She knew it all the while
Oh, I worry just about the drop
Oh, I worry (I'm so worried, mama) about the drop
'Cause it's not the fall that kills you,
But that sudden stop
