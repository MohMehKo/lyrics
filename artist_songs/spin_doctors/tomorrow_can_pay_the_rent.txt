The preacher said, "richer or poorer",
My mama said, "thick or thin",
You can kiss me, baby
When it's time to get thick again
And, baby, you know it's simple
It's just a matter of common sense
I want you to love me, baby,
'til tomorrow can pay the rent
Tomorrow can pay the rent

My friends all think I'm crazy
But my angel knows I'm okay
Forget about tomorrow
We got our hands full with today
And, baby, you know it's simple
It's just a matter of common sense
I want you to love me, baby,
'til tomorrow can pay the rent
Tomorrow can pay the rent

When I wake up in the morning
And see you in the light
You can love me, baby, love me with all your might
When I lay down in the evening
And see you in the shade
I feel your touch and I know I've got it made
Got it made

I'm gonna listen for your laughter
I'm gonna kiss you into next year
I got my blue bandana
In case I need to dry your tears
And, baby, you know it's simple
It's just a matter of common sense
I want you to love me, baby,
'til tomorrow can pay the rent
Tomorrow can pay the rent

Tomorrow can pay the rent...
