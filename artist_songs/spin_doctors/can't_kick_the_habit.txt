Can't kick that habit 
I guess you know
What conversation
But here I go
I can't stand it
Facing this alone

Don't change the subject
If it's not clear
Don't say you're sorry 
Then disappear
Because that means nothing
Nothing if your not here

Can't turn it off alone [3x]

[CHORUS:]
I can sing
But I can't sigh
I can barely breathe the air I need
To justify why I said "so long"
To get so high
I can't kick the habit

To save my soul 
1 foot in heaven
1 in the hole
My whole focus
In a poison picture show

Can't turn it off alone [3x]

[CHORUS:]

If I let you in
Will you let me in? [4x]
