The prophet said to David
"Someday you'll be King
So go on down to King Saul's house
And let him hear you sing
Don't worry what you hear
Don't worry what you see
Don't you worry 'bout his spear
Because my David you got the Key"

You got the Key to the Kingdom...

Jesse said to David
"Goliath's in the vale
What makes you think you'll bring him low
When all our best have failed?"
David said to Jesse
"Just go tell the King for me
I can beat Goliath
'cause I got the Key"

I got the Key to the Kingdom
(If your heart is bold then the Key is gold)
I got the Key to the Kingdom
(If your heart is kind then the Key you'll find)...

David said to Solomon
When he was about to die
"You're gonna build my temple
When I'm by the good, The Good Lord's Side
Don't you worry Son
Able you will be
You can do anything
'cause my Son, you got the Key"

You got the Key to the Kingdom
(If your heart is bold then the Key is gold)
You got the Key to the Kingdom
(If your heart is kind then the Key you'll find)...

Key to the Kingdom...
