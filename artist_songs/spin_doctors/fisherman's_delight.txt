I will lay beside you
On this long and lonely night
'cause the flood that drowns the sailor
Is the fisherman's delight

Love is a super power
Like an endless sea
I will swim to you
If you will swim to me
I can drink your song
I'm drunken from your sound
If this is love then let me drown
Let me drown

What a perfect night
To forget your pain
And finally see the light
After forty nights of rain
Little boy blue come blow your horn
A melody yet to be born

I will lay beside you
On this long and lonely night
'cause the flood that drowns the sailor
Is the fisherman's delight...
The fisherman's delight

Once I was on the hill
Now I am in the hole
But there's a hope that prances
In the footlights of my soul
In a sea of sadness
Find a drop of gladness
Just to fill my bowl

I will lay beside you
On this long and lonely night
'cause the flood that drowns the sailor
Is the fisherman's delight...
The fisherman's delight

Lovers fill the streets
And drag there leaden feet
Somehow they always seem to cry
Bombs and blessings
Everybody's guessing
What will next fall from the sky

I will lay beside you
On this long and lonely night
'cause the flood that drowns the sailor
Is the fisherman's delight...
The fisherman's delight
