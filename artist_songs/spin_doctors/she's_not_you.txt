She don't hear me when I think her name
She don't see what you could look right through
All she really does is make me blue
She's not you

She don't hold a candle to the stars
She don't hold the pink up to the blue
She don't hold my horses the way you do
She's not you

She's not you 
No matter what she do
(She's not you)
I love her too
But she's not you

Diamonds shine like starlight next to glass
Moon light shines like silver in the dew
It doesn't matter what you compare her to 
She's not you

She's not you......

Evening was a shimmer in your hair
Time was just a button on your gown
Memory is the torture I'm going through
She's not you
