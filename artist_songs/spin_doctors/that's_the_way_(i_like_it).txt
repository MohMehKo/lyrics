That's the way, I like it
That's the way, I like it
That's the way, I like it
That's the way, I like it

When you take me by the hand,
Tell me I'm your lovin man
When you give me all your love and do the best,
The very best you can

Oh, That's the way I like it
That's the way, I like it
That's the way, I like it
That's the way, I like it

When I get to be in your arms,
When we're all all alone
When you whisper sweet in my ear,
When you turn, oh you turn me on

Oh, that's the way, I like it
That's the way, I like it
That's the way, I like it
That's the way, I like it

When you take me by the hand,
Tell me I'm your lovin man
When you give me all your love and do the best,
Do the best you can

Oh, That's the way I like it
That's the way, I like it
That's the way, I like it
That's the way, I like it
