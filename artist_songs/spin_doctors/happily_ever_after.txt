Confetti on the floor of the high school gym
boy meets girl and girl meets him
he takes her hand and they dance together
she says, "This is our song,"
and it's theirs forever

This old world is a merry-go-round
with painted horses going up and down
oceans of tears gales of laughter
once in a while someone lives
happily ever after

This world seems cruel at your first glance
look again it's like a dance
once you've had a good long gaze
It seems we all starr in our very own plays

This old is a merry-to-round
with painted horses going up and down
oceans of tears gales of laughter
once in a while someone lives
happily ever after

We grow out of the days like moth-eaten sweater
Half of the time things change for the better
Wait for a call, look for a letter
It ain't over 'till the fat lady sings
yeah...

Finishing's harder than beginning
being good's not as fun as sinning
being right's not as good as winning
It's best to be the one that ends up grinning

This old world is a merry-go-round
with painted horses going up and down
oceans of tears gales of laughter
once in a while someone lives
happily ever after
yeah, yeah

This old world is a merry-go-round
with painted horses going up and down
oceans of tears gales of laughter
once in a while someone lives
happily ever after
