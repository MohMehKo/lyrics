This stupid production is making me think
That history's drawn in invisible ink
Too many graves and not enough houses
Not enough men and too many mouses
We're wearing new rags and we fight over crude
Not enough kind and too many rude
Flashbulbs popping at the Wicked Parade
Don't wake us up till we're all got it made

Smile for the camera and raise your glass
Pull up your socks till they cover your ass
Say, "Goodbye"...
No more mama's apple pie
Damn the torpedoes and take a bow
It'll always be now
All the children say, "Wow"
Say, "Goodbye"...
No more mama's apple pie

Covers are blown at the masquerade
When the rain starts falling on the Wicked Parade
Tell another lie hope you don't get caught
But you better not cry when your soul's been bought
Lifeboats floating out on the flood
Blood's thicker water, love's thicker than blood
Another bullet leaves another mother bereft
And the sergeant says, "To the left!"

Smile for the camera and raise your glass
Pull up your socks till they cover your ass
Say, "Goodbye"...
No more mama's apple pie
Damn the torpedoes and take a bow
It'll always be now
All the children say, "Wow"
Say, "Goodbye"...
No more mama's apple pie

To the left!..
