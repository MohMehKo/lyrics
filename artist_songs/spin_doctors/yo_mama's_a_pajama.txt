[Chorus:]
Yo mama's a pajama and she ain't no good
Yo mama's a pajama and she ain't got no friends
Yo mama's a pajama and she ain't no good
Yo mama's a pajama and she ain't got no friends

I once knew a girl with a funky doo-wop
Spent all her money just to look like a mop.

Yo mama's a pajama and she ain't no good
Yo mama's a pajama and she ain't got no friends

Yo mama's a pajama,
Yo mama's a llama
Yo mama's a pajama

I love myself, I think I'm grand.
I like to sit and hold my hand
When I grow up I'll marry me,
And somehow form a little family

[Chorus]

Yo mama's a pajama,
Yo mama's a llama
Yo mama's a pajama

Yo ma, Yo pa, yo greasy grandma,
She got a big behind like frankenstein,
She go beep beep beep down Sesame Street.

[Chorus]

Yo mama's a pajama,
Yo mama's a llama
Yo mama's a pajama

Ain't she sweet;
She get on down the street [x4]

[Chorus]

I once knew a girl with a funky doo-wop
She spent all her money just to look like a mop.

[Chorus]

I ask you very con-fidenti-al-ly
