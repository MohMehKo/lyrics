The sunset's rag is wringing
The night out of the day
The undercover lovers
Have run out of things to say
The singer's started singing
The strummers start to strum
The night is just beginning
For the vampires in the sun

Vampires in the sun...
The night is always young

The moon's a chunk of silver
The night is like a dress
You can hear the ice cubes jingle
Like a diamond on a breast
The waves make a languid crashing
And lick us like a tongue
And wash the ashen ankles
Of the vampires in the sun

Vampires in the sun...
The night is always young

The evening is undressing
And showing us her stars
The guilty are confessing
To the tenders of the bars
They're knocked out and nocturnal
They stay forever young
The moon it shines eternal
On the vampires in the sun

Vampires in the sun...
The night is always young
