In an office high above us all
An executive received an important phonecall
He said "Yes, sir, I'll do all that I can."
Said "Goodbye," and hung up with the Man
That's the Man
Pulling all the strings
That's the Man
In charge of everything
And the trumpet sings,

"I'm tired of working for the Man
For the Man
I'm tired of working for the Man"

Get up, get up, get out of bed...

Another hopeless dawn dawns on the hopeful people
The bell strikes nine up in the steeple
People work hard, doing all they can
Putting money in the bank account of the Man
That's the Man
Pulling all the strings
That's the Man
When the alarm clock rings
And the trumpet sings,

Get up, get up, get out of bed...

"I'm tired of working for the Man
For the Man
I'm tired of working for the Man"

Meanwhile back up in the office
They're making charts to graph the profits
They will work their whole life span
To line the pockets of the Man
That's the Man
Pulling all the strings
That's the Man
In charge of everything
And the trumpet sings,

"I'm tired of working for the Man
For the Man
I'm tired of working for the Man"

Get up, get up,
Get up, get up, get out of bed...
