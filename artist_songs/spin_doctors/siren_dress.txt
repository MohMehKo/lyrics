Far and away where the waves unwind
And the toothy rock crashes
Wet ankled women with splashed salty hems
Clear their throtes and bat eyelashes
They're the sirens and their silver breath
Makes the sailor's favorite sound
But if you hear that siren song
My friend you're sure to drown

They drive them sailors crazy (ooh la la!)
And leave them wanting more
Those red lipped ladies in their Siren Dresses
They draw you through the door

Far and away where the neon light
Lays languid on the bar room floor
Bright sashed sirens with their second guesses
Have a bite worse than their roar

They drive them sailors crazy (ooh la la!)
And leave them wanting more
Those red lipped ladies in their Siren Dresses
They draw you through the door...

If you go down to the ocean
Put your money in your sock
'cause those red lipped ladies in their Siren Dresses
Wreck a man upon the rocks
If you go down to the ocean
If you go down to the sea
Find a red lipped lady in a Siren Dress
And bring her back for me

They drive them sailors crazy (ooh la la!)
And leave them wanting more
Those red lipped ladies in their Siren Dresses
They draw you through the door...
