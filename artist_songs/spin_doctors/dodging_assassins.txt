Your voice was frightened and kind of dreamy
You said you simply had to see me
And there you were with your martini
Your diamonds were large and your dress was teeny

Dodging assassins two by two
They want your ruby slippers and your little dog, too

Your words had me shaken
Your dress had me stirred
I guess I didn't answer
'cause you asked if I had heard
In your face I watched the lines
The growing lines of anguish
In the air I watched the smoke
From your cigarette languish
There in your face I saw the light
Like you, a fugitive of the night
I took a shot and said that I might
Help you to dodge your assassins

Dodging assassins two by two
They want your ruby slippers and your little dog, too

Like Dorothy I fall...
Little dog and all

There's vampires in the sun
My dear one, they want a piece of you
They want your ruby slippers, baby
And I know they want your little dog, too

Dodging assassins two by two
They want your ruby slippers and your little dog, too...

I don't know why
They want you dead
But now that I've helped you
I think they also want my head
I don't know why they want a piece of you
They want your ruby slippers and your little dog too
