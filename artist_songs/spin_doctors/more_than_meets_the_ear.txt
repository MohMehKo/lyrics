All the roots in the earth
Are speaking to a heart of stone.
The children can hear it in their bones, 
And in this stone is
More than meets the mind.

The particles in the air
Each of each are holding hands.
The music sounding is their dance,
And in this dance is
More than meets the eye.

All our songs are somewhere else being played for us
By glowing hands celestial and not there.

The stars and planets in the sky
Each of each are singing tunes
And listening are all the moons,
And in their tunes are
More the meets the ear.
