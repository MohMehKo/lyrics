Your heart is a refrigerator car
It's cold and it never waits
Frozen breath and frostbite
Stacked, unopen crates

You never loved your frozen freight
Perishables and bloodless meat
You rolling snowball soul of sleet
You never wait....

You roll across desert
And clack across the sand
Though snakes may fry outside
Flowers crumble petrified in your hand
Your heart's a paid-off porter
You lied to spare your soul
With one arm you blow your brains out
With the other you dig the hole

You never loved your frozen freight......

Grey ice in your hinges
Sliding doors shut frozen locked
Airtight every tiny hole
With hard white putty blocked

You never loved your frozen freight.....
