Now our skys are falling down
And we have worn out all our frowns
And we have broken all our crowns
And been run out of all our towns
If it's the rod that wasn't spared
Or the ugly stick that you're below
Everybody took a licking and kept on ticking
Well, and they're all still waiting for the blow

Ahhh
Waiting for the, waiting for the blow...

Tell me now, exactly how
Your heart was broken long ago
It was devistating and you're still waiting
You're still waiting for the blow
I have no choice but to hold my voice
Before your sorry tale of woe
It's no surprise, I can empathize
We're all still waiting for the blow

Ahhh
Waiting for the, waiting for the blow...

[Interlude]

Ahhh
Waiting for the, waiting for the blow...

Tell me, baby, why you're waiting
I want to know just where you're from
The trip to the floor you're waiting for
You know the blow may never come
Take your chances, place your bets
'cause you know you never know
If it never arrives we waste our lives
Waste them waiting for the blow

Ahhh
Waiting for the, waiting for the blow...
