What you don't got I can't give to you
You got calamities to live through
Just when the nickels come a jingling down
You've got to use them all to get out of town

That's the queen you been dancing with
That's my kid sister Sisyphus
That's the queen you been dancing with
That's my kid sister Sisyphus

Hey sissy baby, why you all alone?
You got both your hands upon your big old stone
Hey sissy baby push that stone towards the sky
Hey sissy baby why you curtsey so high?
That's the queen you been dancing with
That's my kid sister Sisyphus
That's the queen you been dancing with
That's my kid sister Sisyphus

You're the kingpin in your end of town
My kid sister come and take you crown
Just when you think you got your system down
What you got going up and come around

That's the queen you been dancing with
That's my kid sister Sisyphus
That's the queen you been dancing with
That's my kid sister Sisyphus
