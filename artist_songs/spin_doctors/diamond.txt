You know my boat has holes
I see you brought your gales
I see you brought you souls
To leave inside my sales
And oh I love you all
Others more than some
You dear best of all
Know where my boat is from

Oh I love you all
Others more than some
Dear you best of all
Know where my boat is from

She had eyes all wild and free
And she had the soul of a guitar
Like a diamond on the sea
Like a stolen burning star

There was no playing lame
There was no playing dumb
You know she knew my name
And where my boat is from
All my rights and wrongs
You know she knew the sum
You know she knew my song
And where my boat is from

Oh I love you all
Others more than some
Dear you best of all
Know where my boat is from
You know where my boat is from
My boat is from...

The diamonds brightly burn
Inside my brokeen heart
We never did return
We never can depart
Don't know where I been
I don't know where to come
And I've had to swim
To where my boat is from

Oh I love you all
Others more than some
Dear you best of all
Know where my boat is from
You know where my boat is from
My boat is from...
