It's a funny way to tell you baby,
What could I do?
I've been talkin to the preacher,
And he sent me to you.
There's a penny on the sidewalk,
But you stepped on a crack
Mama's singing in the kitchen,
But she's clutchin' her back
There's a funny wind a-blowin'
Down the rays you your hair
Everybody doin' cartwheels baby,
But you're still in bed
You can tell me it's your nature, girl
But I don't buy that
I can tell you like to lie
Just by the tilt of your hat

One guy's laughing,
One guy's weeping,
One guy's twitchin'
And you lay sleeping

Tell me why you sleeping baby
One guy's laughing, mama,
One guy's weeping,
One guy's twitchin' down on the floor, mama
Tell me why you sleeping baby

I've been talking in the kitchen,
And I'm skinning a cat
I know you you wanna see my jackknife,
But I'm using a bat
Put the mutton on the table,
There's a fork by your plate
Someone told me you're starving,
But I know you just ate.

One guy's laughing,
One guy's weeping,
One guy's twitchin'
And you lay sleepin'
