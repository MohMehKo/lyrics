I believe in a sense that less is more. The failings of my past will at last, light the path that I will always be true to. Don’t be afraid to take my outstretched hand and walk with me. Promise you’ll follow me through this. Another failure, another second chance. Don’t be content in your misery. If you’re in a state of mind, you think you can’t survive. Another chance is another gone. No closer to fleeing from this state of misery. Breathe in a new day and look around you. Wake up from this dream these walls are closing in. A second chance to start again. Trust that I really did mean to fix this, if you didn’t say no. With every closing door, light shines from another. I would have tried and strived just for us to survive. But one fatal lie will tear us apart. Of all things a lie will be the end of us. (You’re never there, when I needed you most) Oh how those cards have changed. I’m ready to abuse the fucking power. Let’s get this straight. You never meant a thing to me. You’ve had your chances, but you crossed the line. Don’t even think for a second, you’ll ever cross my mind. You’ve had your chances, but you crossed me one too many times. Fuck it, this is goodbye. You are the best thing that never happened to me. Choke.
