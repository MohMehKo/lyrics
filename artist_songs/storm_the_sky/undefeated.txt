Sometimes, with just one finger she’ll say goodbye. Simple as that, the greatest of friends start to fade in time. Open your eyes and realize it’s worth keeping it alive. Sometimes. And when you see them through your tired eyes, and all you see is the path that you’ve destroyed. Well this is all you’ll ever need, to keep moving on and on. You’re always looking for that quick exit sweetheart, everything’s been handed to you. Without warning your walls will come crashing down, and when those last words left your mouth, I left without a sound. One day they’ll see you for what you are. I tell you they won’t be impressed. History cannot repeat itself and nor can you. It’s time you opened those tired eyes. For once just be aware of your surroundings. If you’re not careful in your actions, your surroundings will swallow you whole. I am the storm, I am the sky, that’s bearing down upon you. I am this world, we’ll win tonight, I am, undefeated. Dodge this. And when you see them through your tired eyes, and all you see is the path that you’ve destroyed. Well this is all you’ll ever need, to keep moving on and on. I never thought that we’d grow old. New days seem old. Now’s the time to show me, who you really are. Some call it tempting and some show their courage, which one are you? New days seem old. I thought we were better than this, I was wrong. Run, run, run, watch out, you better watch yourself, before the clock stops ticking. You better make the change, before my patience has passed. You better find yourself, before the clock runs out.
