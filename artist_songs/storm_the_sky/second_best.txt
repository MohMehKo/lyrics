Two keys down and we're ready to wake up
Dressing gown, wiping off her makeup
Stains like they're regrets (How was your night?)
Only one, yeah, no more second best

No more second best, oh

Two keys down, ready to wake up
Two keys down, ready to wake up
Two keys down, ready to wake up
Two keys down, ready to wake up
Two keys down, ready to wake up
Two keys down, ready to wake up

I'm way too proud, hoping to offend
You're nothing now, motherfucker
Your friends just held you off the ground
(Second best)

Heart too loud, head ready to end it
Upside down, hanging on the edge
Just reaching for the gun
I never meant it, I never meant it

Screaming at the sun
"I never wanted it, I never wanted it"
I'm the chosen one
Heaven-sent just like a prison sentence

Screaming at the sun
Heaven-sent just like a prison sentence

Ready to wake up
Ready to wake up
Ready to wake up
Ready to wake up
Ready to wake up
Ready to wake up
Ready to wake up
Ready to wake up
