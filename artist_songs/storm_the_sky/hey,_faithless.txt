Don’t tell me once again that this was all just according to plan. I thought I’d seen everything hidden up your sleeve, I never saw this coming. If only I could find a way, a way through this pain, never again. You left me stranded, you left me scared, I can barely hold on. Quiet, I’ve heard all that there is to hear. You stated your fears to my ears, never again. Falling over I had to let go of all that I knew. Whatever happened to forever now it’s never, (I hope you shake and shiver when you roll over to the cold side of the bed, I’m not there) Hey faithless, we can’t be. I never expected it to come to this so goodbye happiness. (You made me think that I would never be good enough so I kept at it, I gave and gave and gave) Goodbye. When you’re done saying where I went wrong, could you bare to tell me where I belong? I’ll fight ‘til there’s nothing left of me, I’ll go wherever I need. I’ll fly to the furthest star to forget the fact that you left me. Ill fight ‘til there’s nothing left of me, I’ll go wherever I need. I’ll fly to the furthest star to find out how to live my dreams. You had me at goodbye. Now it’s all coming through, I’m finally seeing you. Hey faithless, it’s all…(Whatever happened to forever now it’s never) Whatever happened to forever now it’s never. (I hope you shake and shiver when you roll over to the cold side of the bed, I’m not there) Hey faithless, we can’t be. I never expected it to come to this so goodbye happiness.(You made me think that I would never be good enough so I kept at it, I gave and gave and gave) Goodbye. Hey faithless, you know I needed more, I guess that’s what best friends are for. Waste away like the smoke that disperses in the air, and watch me live on, watch me fight and win and succeed. I know that breaks your heart, but it’s all you deserve, and now we’re even.
