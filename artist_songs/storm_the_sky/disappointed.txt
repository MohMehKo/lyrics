Disappointed
Everything I've ever done is worthless

Who calls the shots lately?
I'm six down because it's dark out
(Six down because it's dark out)
(Six down because it's dark out)

I hate what I'm not, baby
But it's what you have always wanted and I don't belong in your arms

Hate me, I'm on fire
Melbourne's best, never dousing the flames
Hate me, I'm a star
Living in the sky like life's not fair
When the air's so scarce
Thinking I better hope that I fucking make it, yeah

Disappointed
Everything I've ever done is worthless
Disappointed
Everything I've ever done is worthless

So I take this for the fire
But the cocaine sweats never dousing the flames
Baby, me, I'm a star dying for the limelight
Life's not fair, bring your problems here
I know how to make you feel better
We'll fuck till you forget them, yeah

Disappointed
Everything I've ever done is worthless
