Baby, where you been? (Out)
She acts like she cares to act like it hurts
I’m broken. (How?)

Everything I said didn’t matter, happened again
And I never said it then but I get this sense of weightlessness when you’re not around, you're not around
Everyone I touch is just as fucked up
Give it another month because I still love us
You and the rest of them, you’re the best of them
Just what I said to the rest of them

I have sinned (Sin will find you)
You have been forgiving all of it

Everyone I touch is just as fucked up
Give it another month because I still love us
You and the rest of them, you’re the best of them
Just what I said to the rest of them

Baby, where you been?
I never said anything, I never said anything
I’m broken
Honey, you don’t know what broke is
Baby, where you been?
I won’t ever care to admit because that’s what happiness is. I’m broken, I am broken, I am

You have sinned
(I'll remind you, I will)
That you and him started all of it

Everyone I touch is just as fucked up
Give it another month because I still love us
You and the rest of them, you’re the best of them
Just what I said to the rest of them

Baby, where you been?
I never said anything, I never said anything
I’m broken
Honey, you don’t know what broke is
Baby, where you been?
I won’t ever care to admit because that’s what happiness is. I’m broken, I am broken, I am

I know I said I’m fine but I’m dying
I’m going to blame you because it makes you cry
And it’s kind of therapeutic, don’t ask me why
But I like that you don’t think you’re meant for me
Everyone I fucked was picture perfect
I’m living for the bliss, because the bliss is worth it
You and the rest of them, you’re the best of them
Just what I said to the rest of them

Baby, where you been?
I never said anything, I never said anything
I’m broken (I'm broken)
Honey, you don’t know what broke is
Baby, where you been?
I won’t ever care to admit because that’s what happiness is. I’m broken, I am broken, I am

Sin will find you, sin will...
Sin will find you, sin will...
