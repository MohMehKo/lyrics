Where do I begin?
You had so many demons eating at your skin
And I made the most of it
With my patience wearing thin
I thought that I’d get even
So I committed every sin just for the fun of it

And I’d be so good with anyone else
But you look so good, fuck everyone else

I’m taking my old mistakes, putting your name all over them
So you know how it tastes to sip a little bit of your own medicine
Your own medicine
Your own medicine

Lately I’ve noticed that all I am to you is a risk
Always making reality sink in when you’re in the deep end
And you just want to live in the clouds, I’m up there now
Baby, chase me

And I’d be so good with anyone else
But you look so good, fuck everyone else

I’m taking my old mistakes, putting your name all over them
So you know how it tastes to sip a little bit of your own medicine
Your own medicine
Your own medicine
Your own medicine

She’s empty without MD and I’m tempting without entry
Like the clubs that we end up dreaming in
The clubs that we’re never leaving
Till the bugs in our brains start breeding
And we’re fucked and we can’t stop screaming
Yeah, I’m fucked and I can’t stop, I can't stop, I can't stop needing you
Needing you
Needing you
Needing you
(And I’d be so good with anyone else
But you look so good, fuck everyone else)

I’m taking my old mistakes, putting your name all over them
So you know how it tastes to sip a little bit of your own medicine
Your own medicine
Your own medicine
Your own medicine
