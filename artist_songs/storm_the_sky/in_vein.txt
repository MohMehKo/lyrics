I think you cry too much
I can take the stains out of my shirt
But can't do shit about the hurt
I'm sorry that I try so hard
I can't take that, I can't take the pain away

So I'll stay awake for days
And scrape the chamber dry
Where am I, where am I, where am I?
Where am I?

You're beautiful
So take my freezing heart and say it's all in vain
Pull apart my ribs and make sure I stay awake
Make sure I feel the pain
Make sure I feel the pain, oh

I don't know why I'm telling you this
Cause trust is such an irrelevant myth
But life is so much better to live with you
Yeah, with you

I think you're right, my love
We can take the spite out of our words
But can't do shit about the worst three years
I'm sorry that I fucked it up
I can't take that, I can't take the pain away

So I'll stay awake for days
And face the mirror like
"Who am I, who am I, who am I?
Who am I?"

You're beautiful
So take my freezing heart and say it's all in vain
Pull apart my ribs and make sure I stay awake
Make sure I feel the pain
Make sure I feel the pain, oh

I'm throwing rocks at your window, begging you to open up
I'm making love to your bedpost
Cause you don't give a fuck about us

Baby, don't wake me up cause awake I am so alone
Baby, don't wake me up, come and live in my dreams
Where it's all as it seems
And I don't self destruct, baby, don't wake me up

Baby, don't wake me up cause awake I am so alone
Baby, don't wake me up, come and live in my dreams
Where it's all as it seems
And I don't self destruct, don't leave
Baby, don't wake me up, don't leave

Baby, don't wake me up cause awake I am so alone
Baby, don't wake me up, live in my dreams
Where I don't self destruct, don't leave
Baby, don't wake me up, don't leave me here
