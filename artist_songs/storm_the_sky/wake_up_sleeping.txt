Does it worry you? Cause it worries me
Every time we try we end up sinking
Further away from where we wished to be
Does it hold you back the way it breaks me
That my baby is better than everything?

Do you ever wanna wake up?
Do you ever wanna wake up sleeping?
Do you ever wanna wake up?
Do you ever wanna wake up sleeping?

Do you ever wanna wake up?
Do you ever wanna wake up sleeping?
Do you ever wanna wake up?
Do you ever wanna wake up sleeping?

There's nothing left but future mistakes you haven't made
You try to forget that the future's on its way, it's always too late
So regress into what makes you hate your own face
Second guessing lessens the pain for a split second, heaven can wait

Do you ever wanna wake up sleeping?
Have you ever hoped for nothing at all?
Have you finally realised
We're meant to live a lie?

Do you ever wanna wake up sleeping?
Have you ever hoped for nothing at all?
Are you feeling dead inside?
Put your hands up, nod your head and give up

Stop waiting to die

Do you ever wanna wake up sleeping?
Have you ever hoped for nothing at all?
Put your hands up, nod your head and give up
Put your hands up, nod your head and give up

Do you ever wanna wake up sleeping?
Have you ever hoped for nothing at all?
Put your hands up, nod your head and give up
Put your hands up, nod your head and give up

Put your hands up, nod your head and give up
Put your hands up, nod your head and give up

Put your hands up, nod your head and give up
Put your hands up, nod your head and give up
