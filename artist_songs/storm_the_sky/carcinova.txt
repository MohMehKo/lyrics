She said she hates my smile
Well, I faked it all
I could be beautiful
But I don't think I wanna be beautiful

I think I wanna be unusual
I think I wanna breathe in pure gold
I don't think I want to breathe at
Don't think I want to breathe at
Don't think I want to breathe at all

After every single lie I told
You'd think you'd know that I don't have a soul
I'm painting like a Warhol with my words
You're certain I am all alone

All I know is cold, she fucks like ice
She aches and she tastes like Ritalin, so beautiful
I think I wanna breathe in pure gold
I don't think I wanna breathe at all

Distance me, you're so consistently all I need
I'm gone now, I'm gone now, she did it again
She's strung out and begging but
I'm not listening, I've been resisting the air I breathe
I'm gone now, I'm gone now, she did it again
I'm strung out, strung out and buried again

I'm finally alive, I feed my nose, I'm coping
Fuck what you've been told
And I've been on the road to no one
She's at home far from sober and alone

She stares so cold with bloodstained eyes
She aches as she main lines the Ritalin, so beautiful
I think I wanna be unusual
I don't think I wanna breathe at all

Distance me, you're so consistently all I need
I'm gone now, I'm gone now, she did it again
She's strung out and begging but
I'm not listening, I've been resisting the air I breathe
I'm gone now, I'm gone now, she did it again
I'm strung out and buried

How do I tell them I'm the shit?

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I'll give you a taste of fame cause I know you'll give it all to me
Don't use names, it will hit me like reality
Something we don't need

I know I'm more like carcinoma than a modern day Casanova
Won't you come over here? Baby, come over here

She wants to play a little misfit mindgame
Her top is off, she's whispering my name
No, never stop, don't look at me
Make love to my bed frame

Distance me, you're so consistently all I need
I'm gone now, I'm gone now, she did it again
She's strung out and begging but
I'm not listening, I've been resisting the air I breathe
