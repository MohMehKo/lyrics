Hold your head up high, you haven’t lost the fight tonight, and you just can’t give up your rights. Never give in to a cliché, nothing’s worse than becoming a stereotype. Stay true to who you are, it’s what sets you aside. Ultimately, no one likes just another sheep in the herd. Stand up and yell until your throat bleeds, it’s the least you can do for us. We give our all each and every night, because we know that from our actions on this stage tonight, you will continue on with the rebellion. So raise your fist with pride, never let this moment subside and die.
