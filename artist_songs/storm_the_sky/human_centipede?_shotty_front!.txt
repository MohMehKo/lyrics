Before the ends of the world meet, and opposites collide and sink. I’ll show you what it means to live free from regret. Coward, you’re running out of time, to make your mark or get left behind. This world doesn’t owe you shit, it’s up to you to make the most of it. Choose or be chosen. To the ones that will never (never, no never), be the best and the better (I’ll be the best I can be), for now and forever (stay by my side). I can’t believe such a beautiful creation was so wrong in oh so many ways. Through all the choices that I’ve made, you’ll find my legacy’s engraved in stone. No, nothing’s set in stone. The quicker that you learn that, the faster we move on. Leave the past right where it belongs, what’s done is done. If you come at me you’ll be on your knees. To the ones that will never (never, no never), be the best and the better (I’ll be the best I can be), for now and forever(stay by my side). To the ones that will never (never, no never), be the best and the better (I’ll be the best I can be), for now and forever (stay by my side). Don’t listen to anything they say, it’s all fake (promise me you’ll stay). Darling don’t get played, don’t let this be their game (then I could find my way, I never thought it would end like this). I’m there with you in your thoughts (I’m sorry I’m there with you in your). When you see that you’ve been deceived. Then you’ll see, then you’ll believe.
