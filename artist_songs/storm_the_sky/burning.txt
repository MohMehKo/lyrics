Hold tight, darling
I've got to break your heart again
Something about the way it tore me up too
Felt like bliss knowing that it was you
You that I couldn't lose

Oh I feel like losing my way
Don't take these for the pain
You're such a beautiful waste
You taste amazing
I think I'm proving it was desperation
That drove us there and broke your heart in two

I'll just keep on burning, yeah

Oh, I feel like doing away with my yesterdays
I know I'm useless and fake, somehow you stay
I'm searching through the fragments of your smile
Still searching for a reason as to how

When you breathe in
I hold my breath until you breathe out

Burning
Light up the dark
Cause it's so hard to breathe
Without you holding me
And while I'm hurting
I'll tear out my soul
So I can control you
Let me control you

I'm feeling reckless today
Don't tell my father I'm ashamed
I'm going to make some mistakes
The worst gift he gave me was my birthday
What a waste, what a waste

I'm feeling reckless today
Don't tell my father I'm ashamed
I'm gonna make some mistakes

I'll just keep on burning
Light up the dark
Cause it's so hard to breathe
Without you holding me
And while I'm hurting
I'll tear out my soul
So I can control you
Let me control you

Burning, I'm burning
Light up the dark
