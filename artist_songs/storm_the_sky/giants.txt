I’m dreaming of a time where nobody can lie, where everything I touch doesn’t burn in front of my eyes. For just one time, let this be mine. Accepted is my kiss, you take it in, we constantly go through this, let’s make this stick. While this clock swiftly ticks, my last lifeline slowly rips. It tears a hole straight through my eyes, and now I see straight through your lies. I’ve had enough of it all because you took all and more, I don’t know what I could say to you now. Here’s an idea, shut the fuck up! The lies that lay hidden in this song, make it hard to hold on to, perfectly scripted romance gone wrong. But the story is far from over. I need to find the author, there’s chapters left to write, the story must go on. This is the end, our final stand. (I’m coming home tonight, I’m coming home.) Dearly beloved, your time’s forever broken, but with me you’ll always be eternity. The clouds have their time to clear. Dearly beloved, you need to carry me home. When the screaming goes silent, betrayal comes back into focus. We will stand tall. We will be giants. And they will fall, no matter how defiant. I’m dreaming of a time where nobody can lie, where everything I touch doesn’t burn in front of my eyes. For just one time, let this be mine. I’ll roam aimlessly for miles until we’re homeward bound. Until we’re homeward bound. Brave hearts will not back down. It’s time to pick up the pieces, some stories are best left untold. We won’t let fear come between us, there’s no turning back.
