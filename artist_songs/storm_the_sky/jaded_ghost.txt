I’m the son to a jaded ghost
So I’ve heard a lot and I still don’t know much
I said, “I love you,” just enough
But love’s a strong word that don’t mean much
I said it several times or more
And I kind of like the tears when you’re standing at the front door
Yeah, I’m dead but I’ve never felt better
Hands around your throat and you keep begging for more

When I’m done you’ll be screaming my name
Just like they all were
You’re one and the same

She said, “I fucking get it, I did you wrong
It’s done and I’ll regret it by the end of this song”
(I’m so gone)
I’m stuck trying to hold you close (So gone)
It’s like trying to hold on to smoke
I won’t forget it, I won’t stay strong
In love because I couldn’t deal with America
I’m stuck trying to hold you close (So gone)
It’s like trying to hold on to smoke

I’m the son to a jaded ghost, yeah
I’ve learned a lot and you still don’t know much
The way I love you fucks me up
So love’s the wrong word for broken trust
What the hell was I fighting for?
Holding all the tears back screaming at a brick wall
Yeah, I’m dead, never felt better
Hands around my throat and I keep begging for more

“I fucking get it, I did you wrong
It’s done and I’ll regret it by the end of this song”
(I’m so gone)
I’m stuck trying to hold you close (So gone)
It’s like trying to hold on to smoke
I won’t forget it, I won’t stay strong
In love because I couldn’t deal with America
I’m stuck trying to hold you close (So gone)
It’s like trying to hold on to smoke

I know you think I’m the type to chase you
But you think that of everyone
And just in case you taste me, baby
You better chase me
Never drink me straight, come on
Yeah, yeah

She said “I fucking get it, I did you wrong
It’s done and I’ll regret it by the end of this song”
(I’m so gone)
I’m stuck trying to hold you close (So gone)
It’s like trying to hold on to smoke
I won’t forget it, I won’t stay strong
In love because I couldn’t deal with America
Fuck trying to hold you close (So gone)
Fuck trying to hold on to smoke
