It’s like 5:30 or something
I’ve got Lilac and Jeff

You’ve been promising that I’ll make it
I’ve been trying and I’m naked
But if I make it…

I’ll be trying all the time but I won’t come home
You’ll be crying every night through the hotel phone

Baby, I don’t really want this
All these shitty songs just leave me more alone, it’s killing me, you know

It’s killing me and…
I don’t know

Scrape me off the ground after you walk over me
All I ever wanted was the world at my feet
Lead me through the crowd
Bring me to safety

It’s like 9:30, we’re stumbling down Chapel from ‘Revs’
I’ve been promising that I’ll stay here, you’ve been vomiting and I’m faded

But if I stay here

You’ll be crying all the time all alone in bed
I’ll be screaming at a page through a broken pen singing
“I don’t really want this life, this shitty song’s not right, you’re moving on and I’m still here.”

Scrape me off the ground after you walk over me
All I ever wanted was the world at my feet
Lead me through the crowd
Bring me to safety

Fading softly out, need you to remember me
Leave me to the sound, no, you’ll never save me.
All I ever wanted was the world at my feet.
All I ever wanted was everything

Scrape me off the ground

Lead me through the crowd

All I ever wanted was everything
