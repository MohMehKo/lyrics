[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Tatted from my neck
Flocka flocka like this show is
All shirt all just to show of my artwork
She said she in love
Flocka like a flirt
You get no comma
You ain't got all the words

[Vistoso Bosses:]
You gotta be tatted up
Like them rocket bike riders
Rollin' on them harleys
Got me goin narley
I'm checkin' 'cause his sexy with that inked out sleave
And that nimble on his chest like an Ed Hardy tee

Talk like a fool
And he's sweatin' me
And he just my type
Let me see what it's gone be
Shawty said he wanna holla
Tell him hit me up when he leave the tattoo parlor parlor

[Pre-Chorus:]
Yeah he is a keeper
Ta-tatted like a city boy
Those shirts and skinny jeans boy
Ro-rockin like ferrees boy
Ridin' martiguines boy
Co-come be on my team boy
Stuntin' like a gee so
Those tatts don't mean a thing though

[Chorus:]
They tatted tatted up
They make us fall in love
[x4]

No I'm not a collage boy
No no I'm not a collage boy
Tatted like a biker boy
Ta-tatted like a biker boy
[x2]

[Waka Flocka Flame:]
Yo!
Her boyfriend cool
Waka flocka flame
Tattoos and walls
Woosies naked so they might just hate
Flocka got more ink than a marker
Stupid tattoos call me Travis Barker

[Vistoso Bosses:]
His flow so oh so juicy baby
New age bad boys drive us crazy
Tatts on their backs
When the boys walk by
With that skateboard swag
Lookin' mo-hawk fly

And we just wanna show them off
But them tatts so sexy I can't even blow 'em off
Now shawty said he wanna holla
So our first date was at the tattoo parlor

[Pre-Chorus:]
Yeah he is a keeper
Ta-tatted like a city boy
Those shirts and skinny jeans boy
Ro-rockin like ferrees boy
Ridin' martiguines boy
Co-come be on my team boy
Stuntin' like a gee so
Those tatts don't mean a thing though

[Chorus:]
They tatted tatted up
They make us fall in love
[x4]

No I'm not a collage boy
No no I'm not a collage boy
Tatted like a biker boy
Ta-tatted like a biker boy
[x2]

[Bridge: Vistoso Bosses]
Lookin' for a new boo
So over my old dude
He has no steeze to top it off he has no tattoos
Knocks are suited and booted
How you think I like my boys
Let's tell 'em how we do it

[Chorus:]
They tatted tatted up
They make us fall in love
[x4]

No I'm not a collage boy
No no I'm not a collage boy
Tatted like a biker boy
Ta-tatted like a biker boy
[x2]

[Vistoso Bosses:]
(They tatted tatted up) [repeated]
Lookin for a new boo soo over my old dude
He has no steeze to top it off he has no tattoos
Knocks are suited and booted
How you think I like my boys let's tell 'em how we do it

[Waka Flocka Flame]
No I'm not a collage boy
No no I'm not a collage boy
Tatted like a biker boy
Ta-tatted like a biker boy
[x2]

[Vistoso Bosses]
