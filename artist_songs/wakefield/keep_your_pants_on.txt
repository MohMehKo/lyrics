Today sucked we knew it would
Yesterday and tomorrows not looking good
So wake up with the sun,
Go ahead and stare at it if you want
It's all right to be fine
Take my word I do it all the time
Don't let life push you around
Make your own path
Never look back
Some things are to come undone
Zippers are one
Keep your pants
It's too late to take it back
Move forward don't live in the past
Take a deep breath and let it out
Go ahead and tell me what life's about
Stick your foot in your mouth
Make some progress,
Show no progress
Don't let life push you around
Make your own path
Never look back
Some things are to come undone
Zippers are one
Keep your pants on
Keep your pants on
Keep your pants on
It's all right to be fine
Take my word I do it all the time
Stick your foot in your mouth
Make some progress,
Show no progress
Don't let life push you around
Make your own path
Never look back
Some things are to come undone
Zippers are one
Keep your pants on
Keep your pants on
Keep your pants on
