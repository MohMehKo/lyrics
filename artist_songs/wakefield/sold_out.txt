Your formal jealousy is growing childish.
It’s annoying and I’m getting tired of it. 
You forgot the way to be yourself 
and now your telling me I’m trying to be someone else. 

So what if we lost our style.  
We’re trying to make it worth our while.  
We’re not doing this to prove anything 
Watch the ice on my necklace bling.

We’re in it for the money, all the groupie honeys.  
We want your life so we sold out.  
We wanted to be famous with what god gave us.  
We sold our souls to the devil last night 
and wrote this song (wrote this song). 
We sold out (we sold out). 

So what, we won't make it anyway.
Thats too bad and we're sorry.
So what? You say what you wanna say. 
(‘Hey you guys suck' 'sell outs')

So what if we lost our style.  
We’re trying to make it worth our while.  
We’re not doing this to prove anything.  
Check the sound, yeah, we hold it down.

We’re in it for the money, all the groupie honeys.  
We want your life so we sold out.  
We wanted to be famous with what god gave us.  
We sold our souls to the devil last night 
and wrote this song (wrote this song). 
We sold out (we sold out).

We won't be around too long.  We’re just a fad.  
We don't care attention's what we never had.  
I sit here and watch the bills come rolling in.  
One more time for all the kids
