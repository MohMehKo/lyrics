There’s always something pulling me down
Always someone hanging around
And I can’t seem to get away

It’s always someone doing me in
Always something under my skin
And I can’t seem to wash it clean

Clean is not for you, she says
It’s for the others
So leave it alone

And I just can’t find a stomach to eat
I’m un-inclined towards the people I meet
So where on earth does that leave you?

Clean is not for you, she says
It’s for the others
So leave it alo-o-o-ne

It’s always somethin’
It’s always somethin’
Or someone,
fuckin’ with me

Clean is not for you, she says
It’s for the others
So leave it alo-o-o-ne
