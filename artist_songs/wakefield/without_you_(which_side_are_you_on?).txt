All I can say, I can say
I can’t explain it for myself
There’s no other way
To find somebody else
And change my name
I lost my faith
Give me my heart back

Without you in my life
I’d be here without you
In my life, without you
I’ll be fine...

All I can say, all the ways
Of feeling tearing of my face
sunrise and sunset, yeah
Glorifying ways
To surely figure, black and white pictures
I never wanted (down)

Without you in my life
I’d be here without you
In my life, without you
I’ll be fine...

(Cause the shadow with the opposite, forgiving you something I'll forget [?])

It’s my life!

Without you in my life
I’d be here without you
In my life, without you (without you)
I’ll be fine...
fine...
