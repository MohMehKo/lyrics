Knowing less is worth more than knowing everything
Wish I was ignorant
I'm leaving now, I'll go home and wait for you
To call him instead of me
I'll go home and sleep (sleep) on (on)
It, you wear my clothes to bed
Pretending that you still want me
But I know where I stand

What did he say that I didn't say?
How can I change?
Tell me, how can I change?
Let's move on, this takes too long
Can't you admit you were wrong

Next week, I'll still be here waiting
There's no place for complaining
Shut up now, just hear me out
When you make out with him I feel left out
(I feel left out! Yooooww!)

What did he say that I didn't say?
How can I change?
Tell me, how can I change?
Let's move on, this takes too long
Can't you admit you were wrong

What did he say that I didn't say?
How can I change?
Tell me, how can I change?
Let's move on, this takes too long
Why can't you admit you were wrong

Is it wrong to blame it on (Yeaaah, oh Yeaaah)
All the medication I was on
Is it wrong to blame it on (Yeaaah, oh Yeaaah)
All the medication I was on
Is it wrong to blame it on (Yeaaah, oh Yeaaah)
All the medication I was on
Is it wrong to blame it on (Yeaaah, oh Yeaaah)
All the medication I was on

Knowing less is worth more than knowing everything
(Ooo-ah!)
What did he say that I didn't say?
How can I change?
