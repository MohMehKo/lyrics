Dying here, on the phone, no one's talking
In my head, I can hear, angels laughing
But she won't, ever say, what she's thinking
Sunday past, unimpressed, my good suit wasted

He knows, she knows, everyone but me knows
O please, help me, won't somebody tell me
How long will I be waiting
Soaking wet in the rain
I'll just, stand here, quietly complaining

Hard to breathe, memories, casting shadows 
Missing words, little clues, over-thinking
What do I, why do I, no one tells me
In my head, I still hear, angels laughing

He knows, she knows, everyone but me knows
O please, help me, won't somebody tell me
How long will I be waiting
Soaking wet in the rain
I'll just, stand here, quietly complaining

She's inside, warm and dry, and I'm all wet 
Down and low, gettin' old, not dead yet
But I'm just a ghost to her,
I just want things how they were

How long...should I keep waiting
Pulling myself down the drain

How long will I be waiting
Soaking wet in the rain
I'll just stand here quietly complaining [x3]
