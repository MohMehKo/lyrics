We've got a good thing going on
We've got a good thing going on
B-b-baby
Wanting you so bad is a problem, I have
And I know that you need me
But it won't come that easy
I said, I know, I know, Ooh 

C'mon baby, you make me sweat
I'm suffocating
You stole the air from my chest
My heart's on fire
I'm falling from your lips 
You know, you know
We've got a good - good thing going on

We've got a good thing going on
Whisper to me softly
Let your hands do the talking
Resisting temptation
Devoting dedication
Let's move
Shake up (B-b-back up)shake it up
Wanting you so bad 
Is a problem i have
And I know that you need me
But it won't come that easy
'Said I know, I know, Ooh

C'mon baby, you make me sweat
I'm suffocating
You stole the air from my chest
My heart's on fire
I'm falling from your lips 
You know, you know
We've got a good - good thing going on

[JD's Rap:]
Neck snaps cuz you're making me stare
at an ass that moves bodies like an electric chair
Come sit in the air, and I'm in despair
Push me further back in the meantime who cares
But don't leave slight cuz a plant needs light
If you want this love better plant this shit right
Like a dog, lift legs, or better yet give head.
No love for a trick suck a dick..fuck this
Bass, bass, gimme some bass
Catch crabs from a ho punch her in the face
Get a good girl, Cuts hair, gives space
Cooks meatloaf, popcorn, pink lemonade
Dance to the right; dance to left
C'mon y'all, I know you're not deaf
Said dance to the room, dance to the bed
C'mon girls, it's time to give head

C'mon baby
You make me sweat
I'm suffocating
You stole my air from my chest
My heart's on fire (Fire)
I'm falling from your lips (Fire)
You know, you know
We've got a good - good thing going on 
C'mon baby (ahhh)
C'mon baby (ahh)
My heart's on fire (Fire)
I'm falling from your lips (Fire)
You know, you know
We've got a good - good thing going on
