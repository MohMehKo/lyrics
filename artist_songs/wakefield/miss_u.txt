Save me
From my ordinary self
I lay awake
Staring at the pictures on my shelf

The other day
I saw you with your new boyfriend and
He's kind of fake
With his Polo shirt and Khaki pants

Now I'm here at home
And nothing can go wrong
Cause I miss you
I miss you
Sitting by the phone
Sitting here alone
Cause I miss you
Yeah I miss you

Just yesterday
Saw you in the mall with your friends
Go away
But all good things must come to an end
He's cool, I'm not
Go away, Guess you're too hot
Saw me, Crazy, maybe just lazy

Now I'm here at home
And nothing can go wrong
Cause I miss you
I miss you
Sitting by the phone
Sitting here alone
Cause I miss you
Yeah I miss you

Cause I miss you
Cause I miss you
Cause I miss you
Cause I miss you
Cause I miss you
Cause I miss you
Cause I miss you
Yeah I miss you
