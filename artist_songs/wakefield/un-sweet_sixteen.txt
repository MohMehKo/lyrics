Bang! Bang! on the bathroom door
You say you can't take it anymore
I say let's even up the score
I'm sorry
Fall! Fall! The tears are falling
Ring! Ring! Who's that calling?
Stop! Stop! Stop your bawling
I'm sorry

Un-sweet sixteen
Always acting like a beauty queen
Like you're posing in a magazine
Un-sweet sixteen
Un-sweet sixteen
Homecoming queen
Breaking down my self esteem
My un-sweet sixteen

She! She! She only smiled
Smile! Smile! Cuz that's my style
But you acted like a child
Neurotic
Won't let this whole thing go away
Cuz you thought that I was out to play
I just don't know what to say
You're psychotic
