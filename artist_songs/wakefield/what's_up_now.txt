I had a big crush on you, but you crushed it in two
I knew that it was over, before you said we were through
But time is on my side, because you just went to bed
And maybe if I write a song and leave it in your head

You'll wake up realizing that you're really ugly
The mask you wear for all your friends blocks out the reality
I hope that you know, but if you don't care ill say it anyway

[Chorus:]
Why don't you just go, and buy yourself some bigger clothes
That your head will fit in, you just don't understand
And you will never know, cause I never let it show
I'm throwing in the towel, so here I am whats up now?

So here's an empty can of WD-40
Its all I have left of you, to grease up your mentality
You act like theres a halo floating over your head
You lack the common decantcy to regret what you said

[Chorus]

[Jamming]

(Hey)
(Ho)
(Hey)

[Chorus - fade]
