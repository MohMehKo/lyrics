The weight's too much
Much too long I've waited fixed and blushed
By myself and now my mind's made up
And you're all these walls speak of
'Cause seven months is a long time

I get mixed feelings from the talk and the anger
And even more I've got a burn for concern
You know it's not another notch in the bed post

Break down, permission to take off
Gave out license to cross
Big stars shine
Big sparks fly
Count down, permission to take off
Come on, let's get involved
Big stars shine
Big sparks fly

Walk with me 
On a street with a spotlight theme
To the corner of what could be
And you'll see just what I mean
You're damn right I'm a lunatic

I guess there's always been a sore trust issue
But if we jump we know I'll switch parachutes
To hear the same from you is all that I ask for

Break down, permission to take off
Gave out license to cross
Big stars shine
Big sparks fly
Count down, permission to take off
Come on, let's get lost
Big stars shine
Big sparks fly

She went about it effortful and pleasing, with true understanding
My senorita from a B-rate Spanish movie
She's so convincing, she's so convincing, she's so convincing...

Break down, permission to take off
Gave out license to cross
Big stars shine
Big sparks fly
Count down, permission to take off
Come on, let's get involved
Big stars shine
Watch the big sparks fly

She went about it effortful
She went about it effortful
And pleasing
Big sparks fly
Count down, come on
Count down, come on
Big sparks fly
Big sparks fly
