Call me what you will
I have some time to kill
Before we go our separate ways
I promise not to forget you
If you remember me too,

Theres some things that I must do
And then I'll come back to you
I hope that you'll still feel the same
We can throw this all away, yeah

To be honest,
I tried my hardest
To give you, all that you deserve
To see you hurt is all my fault
I'm stupid and I'm sorry

Fall To Pieces,
Don't wait up for,
Lonely she waits
Congratulations I'm not happy
Absence makes the heart grow fond...
So I'm gone

Don't wait up for me
Some things are meant to be
I guess we'll have to wait and see
'Till then I will hold you dear (dear)
I never could believe how you put up with me
You were never a last priority
And those times I hear you say,
You would end up this way

To be honest,
I tried my hardest
To give you, all that you deserve
To see you hurt is all my fault
I'm stupid and I'm sorry

Fall To Pieces,
Don't wait up for,
Lonely she waits
Congratulations I'm not happy
Absence makes the heart grow fond...
So I'm gone

So I'm gone
So I'm gone
So I'm gone...
