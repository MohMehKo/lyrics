It's a beautiful night
with the radio on
I got my shoe laces tied up
tighter than the sun
I turn the radio up (you're the only one)
You see my baby's on her way
well it's turning me on
She she's never gonna stop
until she hits the right spot
I turn the radio the radio up (he turns the radio up)

She's got me dripping from my fingers
She's got me soaked to the bone

You know you're the only one
You're the only one for me
And you know you're the only one
And if you ask I'll get down on my knees
You know you're the only one
You're the only one for me
(you're the only one)

I got my sunglasses on
and four on the floor
I'm gonna push it really hard
until she can't take no more
You see my baby's on her way
she's got a way that's turning me on

She's got me dripping from my fingers
She's got me soaked to the bone

You know you're the only one
You're the only one for me
And you know you're the only one
And if you ask I'll get down on my knees
You know you're the only one
You're the only one for me
(you're the only one)

And you know you're the only one
And you know you're the only one
and if you ask I'll get down on my knees
You know you're the only one fore me
(you're the only one)

For me
