I am in circles, you're a straight line
You are the fix I'd hope to find
And people can be so
All that I want now is not to change
You are the hope you will stay the same
And people can let go

I like to keep your pictures candle lit
I need you to be someone I worship
Might be to hard to handle if you were mine
And that is why I built this shrine

I keep my distance, everything's clear
And there are no words I need to hear
It's better for both of us
And all that I want now is not stray 
I need the strength you radiate
It's something I can trust

I like to keep your pictures candle lit
I need you to be someone I worship
Might be to hard to handle if you were mine
And that is why I built this shrine

It's everything I never told you
And I don't ever need to own you
I don't ever want to hold you 
Until you die
So don't don't don't

I like to keep your pictures candle lit
I think you could be someone I worship
Might be to hard to handle if you were mine
And that is why I built this shrine

I like to keep your pictures candle lit
I think you could be someone I worship
Might be to hard to handle if you were mine
And that is why I built this shrine
