They say we look fake,
But I don't care at all
well people may think
we may rise to fall
sad but true
it might be you, it's not like you

Saturday, you come my way
And I don't want you to go home
I take you out, thats what you're all about
its better than sitting on the phone

Then she says to me
Everything will be okay
She's just another girl for the summer
She's just another girl for the summer
She's just another girl for the summer
She's just another girl for the summer

We're close behind,
She's lookin fine
I can't get her off my mind
Her mother said,
She wants me dead
it keeps getting better everyday

Then she says to me
And Everything will be okay
She's just another girl for the summer
She's just another girl for the summer
She's just another girl for the summer

Sitting in my room where I can think
Chillin in my room with the SMC
Girlfriend calls to break things off
Her moms round one is not my fault
Sad but true, don't accuse
its for you

At nights u come to blame,
Shatering my self-esteem
You were so mean but whatever ever
I'm not feeling estranged
from the feelings you claimed
I just wanna get them off my chest
get out of my face

Why can't it be just how things were when we began
when days go my we manifest and do the best that we can
I'm much abliged and when it meets your eyes
We discredit all the lies

Then she says to me
Then she says to me
Yeah yeah

They say we look fake,
but I don't care at all
people may think
we may rise to fall
sad but true
it might be you, it's not like you

She's Just Another Girl for the summer
She's Just Another Girl for the summer
She's Just Another Girl for the summer
She's Just Another Girl for the summer
She's Just Another Girl for the summer
She's Just Another Girl for the summer
She's Just Another Girl for the summer
Just Another
