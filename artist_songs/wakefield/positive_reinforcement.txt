Today sucked
You knew it would
Yesterday and tomorrow's not looking good
So wake up
With the sun
Go ahead and stare at it if you want
Leave me outside where
I can't breathe

Today sucked
You knew it would (Waahhooohh Waahhooohhohoh)
Today sucked
You knew it would
yes you did, yes you did, and tomorrow's not looking good

It's too late
To take it back
Move forward
Don't live in the past
Take a deep breath
And let it out
Go ahead and tell me what this life's about
Leave me outside where
I can't breathe

Today sucked
You knew it would (Waahhooohh Waahhooohhohoh)
Today sucked
You knew it would
yes you did, yes you did, and tomorrow's not looking good
Today sucked
You knew it would (Waahhooohh Waahhooohhohoh)
Today sucked
You knew it would
yes you did, yes you did, and tomorrow's not looking good
And tomorrow's not looking good
And tomorrow's not looking good

You're ticking like a time bomb
Mentally insane, no one but yourself to blame
So wake up (wake up)
So wake up (wake up)
So wake up!

Today sucked
You knew it would (Waahhooohh Waahhooohhohoh)
Today sucked
You knew it would
yes you did, yes you did, and tomorrow's not looking good
Today sucked
You knew it would (Waahhooohh Waahhooohhohoh)
Today sucked
You knew it would
yes you did, yes you did, and tomorrow's not looking good

Don't let life push you around
(Waahhooohh Waahhooohhohoh)
Make your own path, tomorrow's not looking good
(Oooooohhhh)
Don't let life push you around
Make your own path and never look back
