You need the ground
You needed face down
I tried to tell you this
I hit you back
There was no impact
The smarter you are
The harder it is

And there's no use calling now
I'm making my way out
Cause when you hit the pavement
I don't wanna be around
Whatever hill you're climbing now
I know you'll roll back down
And nothing I can do will save you
So I don't wanna be around

Already done
Burning since day one
You have taken this to far
You forced it down
Like it's something bad now
But I don't mind
It's what you hide inside

And there's no use calling now
I'm making my way out
And I'm not gonna blame you
But I don't wanna be around
Whatever hill you're climbing now
I know you'll roll back down
And nothing I can do will save you
So I don't wanna be around

When everything is rattling
What you bring will detonate us all
Detonate us all
So turn it off
Had enough
Find the pulse
Don't you let it fall
Don't you let it fall
I don't wanna be around

And there's no use calling now
I'm making my way out
Cause when you hit the pavement
But I don't wanna be around
Whatever hill you're climbing now
I know you'll roll back down
And nothing I can do will save you
So I don't wanna be around

Leave you 
I don't wanna be around [x2]

When everything is rattling
What you bring
I don't wanna be around
Had enough
Give it up
Your just stuck
I don't wanna be around
