Girl with a beat. girl with a beat. girl with a beat
I'm just a sucker for a girl with beat
Sh-sh-she’s shaking with me under the sheets
She’s so contagious, everyone that she meets
Just can’t help shaking. girl with a beat

I'm all hung up on a girl with a beat
She used to do me from my head to my feet
She's so contagious when she walks down the street
Everyone starts dancin'. everyone but me

Because I knew her before 
When she was young and assure
And only her hands were shakin'
Now she's a popular girl
I'm sharing her with the world
I tell you the girl she's breakin'...me

Girl with a beat. girl with a beat. girl with a beat
I can't stop thinkin' bout a girl with a groove
She makes a dead man wanna get up and move
She got me rockin' and she'll do it to you
And you won't stop dancin'. girl with a beat

I'm was a victim of a girl with a beat
She keeps a water pistol under the seat
She told me secrets but I wasn't discrete
Now there's no more dancin'. not with me

Now she won't answer my calls
She's got me climbin' the walls
And I'm just a mess she's makin'
All the boys stand in line
I'm just wastin' my time
I tell you this girls she's breakin' me

Girl with a beat.
I used to dance with her in perfect time
I lost the rhythm and she changed her mind
She got away with the per-perfect crime
Everyone stop dancin'. everyone stop dancin'
Stop.

Now she won't answer my calls
She's got me climbing the walls
I'm just a mess she's making
Now she's a popular girl
I'm sharing her with the world
I'm tellin' ya girl I'm breakin'....
