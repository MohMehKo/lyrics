I've never met someone quite like you
Sorry for what I've done and put you through
We were together that night
when it all went wrong
Heaven's coming
She moves over and slides her hand in mine
The wheel slips and we cross the double line
We were together that night 
when it all went wrong
Heaven's coming

Don't cry tonight, don't cry tonight
I know that it will be alright
Don't cry tonight, don't cry tonight
You're still with me

We finally came to stop on the other side
You were still in the car, so where was I
Somebody wake me up
I swear I must be dreaming
This can't be happening
I feel her screaming
In the end

Don't cry tonight, don't cry tonight
I know that it will be alright
Don't cry tonight, don't cry tonight
You're still with me 

I can't breathe, (I can't breathe)
I still feel your arms around me
In my dreams
You're still with me

Now I'm older, still lonely
But you're by my side
I can't help but get choked up
Break down and cry
I held your last breath in my hands
But I let it go
God forgive me

Don't cry tonight, don't cry tonight
I know that it will be alright
Don't cry tonight, don't cry tonight
You're still with me

Don't cry tonight, don't cry tonight
I know that it will be alright
Don't cry tonight, don't cry tonight
You're still with me
