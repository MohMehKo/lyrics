Picture this: a change of scene
A life with you falls short of my dream
You're running too fast on a short leash
Let me give you the distance that you need
The strength to be
Yourself and not that alter ego
Try to breathe
shut your eyes fall to the bottom

You're crying, I'm begging
Hear me, I know you're dreading
You're crying, I'm begging
Don't go
You're crying, I'm begging
Hear me, I know you're dreading
Honesty, sometimes

Let's try this, just let it be
Your stark green eyes steal the best of me
You wonder if I can see through the dark
Even I can't see the light that you need
The strength to be
Yourself and not that alter ego
Try to breathe
Shut your eyes, fall to the bottom

You're crying, I'm begging
Hear me, I know you're dreading
You're crying, I'm begging
Don't go
You're crying, I'm begging
Hear me, I know you're dreading
Honesty, sometimes
Honesty, sometimes (You know that you're hurting me)
Honesty, some-
You're crying, I'm begging
Hear me, I know you're dreading
You're crying, I'm begging
Don't go
You're crying, I'm begging
Hear me, I know you're dreading
You're crying, I'm begging
Don't go
You're crying, I'm begging
Hear me, I know you're dreading
Honesty, some-
Honesty, some-
Honesty, sometimes
