Now the year is almost over
Nothing left to keep me sober
Suck it up, where am I going now
School is out, the rumor's ending
No more time for me pretending
That the girl I want is here right now
I'm on my own

Give me a reason
That I should care anymore
That I should care anymore
Don't look now, 'cause it's a long way 
Down

Teacher's done with all their failing
In too deep and now I'm bailing
But the water's way above my head
Old notebooks and dirty lockers
Thoughts of you and staying after
School with the girl that's leaving me behind
I'm on my own

Give me a reason
That I should care anymore
That I should care anymore
Don't look now, 'cause it's a long way
Down

It's over maybe forever, I'm on my own
Time is running out, my days are spent
The clock's ticking out, I'm on my own
Now the year is almost over
Everyone is clean and sober
Suck it up I'm in the real world now

Give me a reason 
That I should care anymore
That I should care anymore
Don't look now, 'cause it's a long way
Down

Hold on to, what you do
When you find your own
Hold on to, what you do
When you find your own
Don't look now, 'cause it's a long way
Down
