I know enough now
To judge you somehow
A first impression that always leaves me 2nd guessing
I'm not the kind of guy
Screw hello,
You had me at goodbye

So you think you had the right to tell me what to do
I didn't see you crying after you said that we were through
I don't wanna go but after all it's what she said
Why do you keep playing these games with my head

Turn around, walk away
Make is easier
No one's forcing you to stay
Make it easier
You stole my past
I want it back
Don't let the door hit your ass
I hope he makes you cry
Screw hello, you had me at goodbye

Summertime and the rain is falling outside
And I can't feel my arms around you
At night you're calling, the tears are falling
and I haven't a clue what to do

Turn around, walk away
Make is easier
No one's forcing you to stay
Make it easier
You stole my past
I want it back
Don't let the door hit your ass
I hope he makes you cry
Screw hello, you had me at goodbye

Turn around, walk away
Make is easier
No one's forcing you to stay
Make it easier
You stole my past
I want it back
Don't let the door hit your ass
I hope he makes you cry
Screw hello, you had me at goodbye

Screw hello, you had me at goodbye
Screw hello, you had me at goodbye
Screw hello, you had me at goodbye
Screw hello
