You never let me down
You always stuck around
I know I upset you (I know why)
I know I upset you (I know why)
But I never meant to
Cuz in you we trust
You were always there for us

This song is dedicated to you (and you)
For making us feel like we do (thank You)
I wanna thank you,
Thank you

I never meant to hurt you with lies (All the lies that I said)
But you saw the truth in my eyes (And my eyes can't pretend)
It's not a problem,
But it annoys me
The dumb decisions I make I was carefree
But somehow through all the stuff that you knew
The ass that I am
well I still care for you...

This song is dedicated to you (and you)
For making us feel like we do (thank You)
I wanna thank you,
Thank you

Thank you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

This song is dedicated to you (and you)
For making us feel like we do (thank You)
I wanna thank you,
Thank you

This song is dedicated to you (and you)
