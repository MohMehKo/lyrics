I've never met someone
quite like you
sorry for what I've done
and put you through
we were together that night
when it all went wrong
Heaven's coming

she moves over and slides
her hand in mine
the wheel slips and we cross
the double lines
we were together that night
when it all went wrong
Heaven's coming

we finally came to a stop
on the other side
you were still in the car
so where was I
somebody wake me up
I swear I must be dreaming
this cant be happening
I feel her screaming

in the end

don't cry tonight
and I know that it will be alright
don't cry tonight
you're still with me

now I'm older, still lonely
but you're by my side
I cant help but get choked up
break down and cry
held your last breath in my hands
but I let it go
God forgive me

in the end
in the end

don't cry tonight
and I know that it will be alright
don't cry tonight
you're still with me

don't cry tonight
and I know that it will be alright
don't cry tonight
you're still with me
you're still with me
