My mom told me to get a job
Work with neighbor Bob
Why can't I get some sympathy 
Don't yell at me
I'm almost eighteen
Not to mention,
I'm so poor I can't afford to pay attention 
What can I say? we don't get paid

We suck ya we're never gonna make it
We're to dumb to be rich and famous (rich and famous)

I'm sick of doing what I'm told
This shit is getting old
I sold the family car
bought a guitar gonna be a s-s-s-s-star star s-star

We suck ya we're never gonna make it 
We're to dumb to be rich and famous 
Record companys don't even wanna claim us
We suck yeah but who could blaim us?

We're just like you and we're never gonna make it
We're to dumb to be rich and famous.

Is it the way I comb my hair?
The way I talk? the way I walk?
The clothes I wear? what can I say?
We don't get paid.

I don't wanna throw my life away.
