it's over and over, it's only getting older
it's harder to be, around her and me
she acts like she's part of the family.

Do you understand, what's happening here-uh ho?
Do you understand, it's time to release-uh ho?

until you're off the page.

Yea I'm right so what's wrong 
with this twisted picture frame?
'Cause I gave you all that I could
you changed me, but not for good.

(you got it, you got it)
(I cut you out of it, out of it)
(you got it, you got it)
(I cut you out)

I'm pretty sure, we've tried this before
the same situation, with no invitations.
So call in the guards, I've fallen backwards
it's over and over, it's all absurd

I don't understand, what's happening here-uh ho
I don't understand, it's time to release-uh ho

You know I'm right so what's wrong 
with this twisted picture frame?

(you got it, you got it)
