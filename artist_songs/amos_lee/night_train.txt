I've been working on a night train
Drinking coffee, taking cocaine
I'm out here on a night train
Trying to get us safely home

Well in a little country station
Somewhere out in the midwest
I see the people out there waiting
Heart beating in my chest

And I'm thinking about a woman
Who I would put no one above
I'm not looking to replace her
Just need someone to love

Well I'm out here on my night train
Drinking coffee, taking cocaine
I'm out here on a night train
Trying to get us safely home

And I'm living in the city
Where the noise, it never stops
Hammers pounding on the pavement
Whistles from traffic cops

Nobody looks you in the eye here
Walking around with clinched fists
I've been searching for a simple place
Don't know if it exists

There's a sunrise out there calling my name
I can see her moving, I can see her moving

Well at a certain time of night, now
I'll become one with the wind
Where there isn't a beginning
And there is no end

Oh when everything is flowing
Everything is on time
And I know that we're all going
To the end of the line

Well I'm out here on my night train
Drinking coffee, taking cocaine
I'm out here on a night train
Trying to get us safely home

Well I'm out here on my night train
Drinking coffee, taking cocaine
I'm out here on a night train
Trying to get us safely home
Trying to get us safely home
Trying to get us safely home
