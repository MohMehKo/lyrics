Highways, clouds
Ain't no stopping, it's all I've gotten
As far as I've dropped in, as far as I've come
I'm from the badlands
Raised up by hard hands
You can't feel your face when

The wind makes you numb
Highways and clouds
Highways and clouds
We meet in the middle
With highways and clouds

Based Madonna
Do you wanna
Hop on my Honda
And get on the run
When you're rollin'
You lose all your schoolin'
It's all for fools man

That can't come undone
Highways and clouds
Highways and clouds
We meet in the middle
Highways and clouds
Highways and clouds
Highways and clouds
We're all lost a little
In highways and clouds

Ain't no roadmap
We lost it at Flagstaff
It's too late to turn back
There's nothing to gain
So swallow me darkness
The cruel and the heartless

Will hold to our harness
And feed from our pain
Highways and clouds
Highways and clouds
We're all lost a little In highways and clouds
Highways and clouds
Highways and clouds
We meet in the middle
Of highways
And clouds
