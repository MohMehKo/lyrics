Oh, Jesus can you help me now, (Jesus can’t cha help me now)
Oh, Jesus can you help me now, (Jesus will you help me now)
Oh, Jesus can you help me now, 
No, I never felt so alone

I remember when I was wild and free
Oh, so wild and free
Oh, so wild and free
But my heart was a skipping stone

But now the world has jaded me
Oh, corrupted and defeated me
You know I never thought you hated me
But I’ve never felt so alone.

Oh, Jesus will you help me now, (So, Jesus won’t cha help me now)
Oh, Jesus will you help me now, (Jesus will you help me now)
Oh Jesus will you help me now, 
No, I never felt so alone, 
So alone,

Oh Jesus
Oh Jesus
Oh Jesus (won’t cha help me now)
Won’t cha help me now
Oh Jesus
Won’t cha help me now
