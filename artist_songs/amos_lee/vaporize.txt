Should've let you walk away the first time
Instead of letting you walk back through my door
As if I needed any more pain

Oh I've been waiting up so long
I've been sleeping out so long in the rain
Rain been falling down
I've been stressing all the time
And I can't seem to find
A little piece of mind 

I guess I'll just vaporize
Everything that's inside
I guess I'll just vaporize
I, I, I
I guess I'll just vaporize
Everything that's inside
I'm gonna get
high, high, high, high, high, high

Now you want to talk about the hard times
And all the joy that you bring
Are you even listening
To the strain

Oh I've been waiting up so long
I've been sleeping out so long in the rain
Rain been pouring down
I've been stressing all the time
I can't seem to find
A little piece of mind

I guess I'll just vaporize
Everything that's inside
I guess I'll just vaporize
I, I, I
I guess I'll just vaporize
Everything that's inside
I'm gonna get
High, high, high, high, high, high

Ain't no use in the truth
When the lies are raw anyway
Ain't no use in the truth, you say

Ain't no use in the truth
When the lies are raw anyway
Ain't no use in the truth, you say

I guess I'll just vaporize
Everything that's inside
I'm gonna just vaporize
I, I, I
I'm gonna just vaporize
Everything that's inside
I'm gonna get
High, high, high, high, high, high
