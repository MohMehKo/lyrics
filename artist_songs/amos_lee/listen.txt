Listen
Listen to them church bells ringing
Listen
Listen
You can hear them hounds calling off in the distance
If you listen
You can hear the engines stalling
You can hear the angels falling

And travel
You find men and women all have trouble
If you travel
You will that the poor are victims of the gun or gavel
If you travel

But be careful now
Be careful of all them folks out there who surround you
Be careful
Some of them really only want to ground you
They only want control
Tear you down to that hole
So be careful
Yeah

Now listen
Listen to them church bells ringing
Listen
Listen
You can hear them hounds calling off in the distance
If you listen
You can hear the engines stalling
You can hear the angels falling
You can hear the engines stalling
And oh oh the angels falling
Alright
