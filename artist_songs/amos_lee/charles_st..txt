LoLita, you’re a cheater
I don’t wanna see you again
You had the guts to tell me
You were my best friend
Aww but best friends
They don’t do me like ya done
You broke my heart to have a little fun

You call me up crying
Saying it was just a fling
I think you’re just trying ta feel better
About doing a shitty thing
Aw but save them tears
I hope you feel ashamed
Cuz deep inside I’m gonna take the blame

Every man has his pride
Even though he keeps it locked up
Deep down inside
And I know just little kids
Can swap out the lights 
Of what you did

LoLita, you’re a cheater
I don’t wanna see you no more
You showed up again cryin’
Outside of my front door
Aw but save them tears
I hope you feel ashamed
Cuz deep inside I’m gonna take the blame

And it’s time you go downtown to fuck that asshole
Do one last thang for me 
Don’t park your car down on Charles St.
That’s how I get out 83
