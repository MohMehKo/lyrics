I aint no wide eyed rebel,
oh but i aint no preacher's son.
Now, i see the trouble, 
in all the loving that I've done.

And the world,
aint no harder than it's ever been.
Looking for love in the lies
of a lonely friend. 

And so much superstition, 
and so much worry in my heart.
I need a new religion,
it's time to make a brand new start.

And the world, 
aint no easier than it's ever been.
Looking for love in the lies
of a lonely friend.

Remember when we were in California,
we were so much happier then. 
Now we're back in New York City,
looking for love in the lies 
of a lonely friend.

And now the clocks are running,
but no one knows where time goes.
Another moon is stunning,
there's only shadows that she shows.

And the world, 
aint no easier than it's ever been.
Looking for love in the lies
of a lonely friend.

I aint no wide eyed rebel,
oh but i aint no preacher's son.
