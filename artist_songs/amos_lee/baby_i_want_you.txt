Baby I want you
Baby I want you
Baby I do

Darling I love you
Darling I love you
Know that it's true

Don't leave me here out on my own
Don't you know how I hate to be alone
I just want to be a part of your home

Baby I want you
Baby I want you
Baby I do

Darling I love you
Darling I love you
Know that it's true

Don't leave me here out in the cold
Don't you know that it's your hand I want to hold
As these days fly past and unfold

Hey hey hey hey

Baby I want you
Baby I want you
Baby I do

Darling I love you
Darling I love you
Know that it's true
