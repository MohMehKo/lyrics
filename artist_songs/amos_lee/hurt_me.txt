Well the sun come up and I'm feelin' so blown away
Don't know what I'll do to make it through another day
Cause I'm reaching past the breaking point again
And I'm beggin' you to put this to an end 

I want you to hurt me
Break me down I want you to hurt me
Let the pain lead me out
I don't want your mercy, tonight
I wanna see the devil in your eyes
Are you strong enough to watch me die

Late at night while I lie awake watching you so peacefully
Oh a fantasy of how you're gonna set me free
Cause this brutal truth is too true to deny
And I'm begging you to free the pain that locks me up inside

I want you to hurt me
Break me down
I want you to hurt me
Let the pain lead me out
I don't want your mercy, tonight
I want to feel the devil in your eyes
Are you strong enough to watch me die

I want you to hurt me
Break me down
I want you to hurt me
Let the pain lead me out
I don't want your mercy, tonight
I want to feel the devil in your eyes
Are you strong enough to watch me die
