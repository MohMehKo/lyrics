Misty mouth lady, won’t you borrow me tonight
I’m gon’ keep you company
Or until the morning light
I don’t want you to be untrue
I don’t want you to be untrue
But the truth is, I’m the man who wants you

Sit right down, and I will
I’m gon’ give you an ended aim 
Let the game come easily
You don’t have to understand
I don’t want you to be untrue
I don’t want you to be untrue
But the truth is, I’m the man who wants you

Misty mouth lady, won’t you borrow me tonight
I ain’t having the same one
He did not treat you right
I don’t want you to be untrue
I don’t want you to be untrue
But the truth is, I’m the man who wants you

I don’t want you to be untrue
I don’t want you to be untrue
But the truth is, I’m the man who wants you
