Look up child 
The world is born 
Shoe's untied 
And your soles are worn 

Windows are rolled down 
Sun is setting high 
Windows are rolled down 
I'm fixin' to die 

Corn rows have companion feel 
This rocky road and this steering wheel 
Who do you call to ease your pain 
I hope for you to get through this rain 

Windows are rolled down 
Moon is hanging low 
Windows are rolled down 
Think it's time for me to go hey-ay-ay-a...-ay 

Is it what you dreamed it'd be 
Are you locked up in this fantasy 
Oh this miles that have 
torn us apart 
My new found faith 
and my broken heart 

Windows are rolled down 
Sun is rising high 
Windows are rolled down 
Feel that wind rushing by hey-ay-ay-a... 

Windows are rolled down
