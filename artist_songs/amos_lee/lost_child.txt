Lost child only wants to find a place
where he can fit in and play
Rain cloud hovers all around
his head he's hidden away
Through all this pain
oh I can see these clouds just drifting away

Through all this pain
oh I can see these clouds just drifting away
A black rose grows in the city garden, hidden away
Despite not finding the proper sunlight, she finds a way
Through all this pain

oh I can see these clouds just drifting away
Through all this pain
oh I can see these clouds just drifting away, oh
Lost child hungry for a celebration, sits upon a stone

Left with only his imagination, still a party is thrown
Through all this pain oh I can see these clouds just drifting away
Through all this pain oh I can see there's gonna be a celebration day, oh
