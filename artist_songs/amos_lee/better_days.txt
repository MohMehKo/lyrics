The darkness has always been, 
The world was born into a blanket of sin, 
When all the faith's been gone, 
Still we found a reason to carry on, 
Through the worrry, worry, worry, 
Caught in an endless maze 
Oh when the lights go out, 
All i can think about, 
Is how, we've seen better days... 

Oh lover lately i've been thinkin i might leave you, 
As you're surrounded by these fools who do decieve you, 
Yes our past is wretched true, 
But i'm still in love with you, 
Thats why i am still refusin to give in to 
All this worry, worry, worry 
Caught in an endless maze, 
But when the lights go out, 
All i can think about, 
Is how, we've seen better days 

Where do we go from here, 
While we're all so consumed by feer, 
Why im trying not to be suspiscious of those im suspicious of, 
I'm tryin to crackopen this angry heart and find a little love, 
Still i worry, worry, worry, 
Caught in an endless maze, 
Still when the lights go out, 
All that i can think about is how we've seen better days, 

Oh when the lights go out, 
All i can dream about, 
Is how, we've seen better days...
