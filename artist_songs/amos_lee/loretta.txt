She don’t suffer no fools
She don’t play by nobody’s rules but her own
She got the peaches ‘n cream, that old ice cream dream
Deep down in her bones
Yeah...

Loretta, Loretta, Loretta 

Well, if you’re ever in need
There ain’t no way she gonna let you bleed on your own
If she got a dollar to spare and your cupboards are bare
She’ll give you a loan

Loretta, Loretta, Loretta 
Loretta, Loretta, Loretta 

She’s the sunshine in the bluest of skies
She’s the truest friend you’ll ever have in your life

She ain’t nothing but love
She ain’t never gonna put herself above no one
And when the heat comes down and there’s no one around
That girl don’t run

Loretta, Loretta, Loretta 
Loretta, Loretta, Loretta 
Loretta, Loretta, Loretta 
Yeah...
