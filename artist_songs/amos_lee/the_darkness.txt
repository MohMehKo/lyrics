Well I never asked for nothin'
I got nothin' in return
Turn out that there's something
Letters bound and burned

Well I know you think you knew me
Well I thought I knew you too
I guess I was a fool but...
That ain't nothing new
We all fall into... the darkness

oooh the darkness
oooh the darkness
Befor the Dawn

Well I never was wasteful
with the time I had at hand
Guess I had to chase you
So I had to understand
That we all fall into... the darkness

oooh the Darkness
oooh the Darkness
Before the Dawn

So go get out my records
If you take one last request
Tell me that you love me
that you always did your best
So I sense I fell into... the darkness

oooh the darkness
oooh the darkness
oooh the darkness
