Baby in your loving eyes
Baby in your loving hands
Baby I can see right now
It's only you who understands

When there are no cures
My pain becomes yours

Sitting in this twilight
With a half-drawn shade
Don't wanna lose that light
Never wanna see it fade

I don't wanna lose you yet
I wanna see another summer sunset

With you
With you

Baby the sea gonna rise
And then the sea gonna fall
I just hope there's peace
Somewhere beyond this wall

I'm gonna keep you here with me
Wherever you go
Wherever you're gonna be
That's where I'm gonna go

I'll be
With you
With you

Baby in your loving eyes
Baby in your loving hands
