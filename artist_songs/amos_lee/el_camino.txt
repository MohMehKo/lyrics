Well all my friends treated me so well
You know I'm headed out to that Mission Bell
Gonna wash my soul, gonna get it clean
Heading down the border road called the El Camino

Well I've been a prince and you know I've been opposed
By a barb wire fence and a murder of crows
I believe in all I've loved and all I have seen
Heading down the border road called the El Camino
Heading down the border road called the El Camino

Yeah my hearts grown sick,
I've got a shepherds crook as a walking stick
And I'm heading on.
My hearts gone blue and I've done wrong by you
I don't know what to do
But I'm moving on, said I'm moving on

One and one is two, two and two is four
I'm walking back and forth
On your cracked tiled kitchen floor
With the orange juice and the sun that shines
It really breaks my heart leaving you behind,
It really breaks my heart leaving you behind

And all my ships have sailed away
The price of this politic,
That there's plenty of time to prayer
And plenty of time to waste away.

Well to all my friends, that I've loved the most
You know I'm heading out to that other coast
I'm going to wash my soul, and I'm gonna get it clean
Heading down the border road, called the El Camino,
Heading down the border road, called the El Camino.
