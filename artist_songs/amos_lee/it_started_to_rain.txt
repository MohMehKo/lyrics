Sally Jane 
How did it end up this way 
With our boxes packed 
And not one word to say 
The children play 
As your car pulled away 
I didn't realize 'til then 
It was really goodbye 
With your wheels on the gravel 
I felt my heart strings unravel 
As it started to rain 
It started to rain 
It started to rain 
Forty days 
It started to rain 
The neighbors came 
And they bought what remained 
Of the life we built 
With lovin', with laughter 
Then my heart started sinking 
'Cause I couldn't help thinking 
Their fate would be the same 
It started to rain 
It started to rain 
Forty days 
It started to rain 
It started to rain
