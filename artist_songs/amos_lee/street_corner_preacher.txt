[Verse 1:]
He got a new mercy
A new grace
Street corner preacher
With the angry face
He got 2 years off
For good behavior
Back in the neighborhood
Working for the savior
There's two old ladies
And a junkie, noddin off
He can see for sure
That his work is cut out
Though he walks thru the shadows
We won't fear his neighbor
Back in the neighborhood
Working for the savior

[Chorus:]
Bau, bau
Put it on back
Ah put it in
Ah bau bau,
Put it ooh bop
Ah put it in
Ah bau bau
Put it ooh bop
Ah put it in
Ah, bau bau
Ya ya

[Verse 2:]
Well he understands
The need for livin it large
But it's hard to get a job
With a felony charge
Now he's working in a hospital
Washin dishes
Walking thru the fields
To the lost inhibitions
There is death everywhere
The new, been addiction
To save the liver
From the waking death is his conviction
The eyes of man
Well he seeks no favor
Back in the neighborhood
Workin for the savior

[Pre-Chorus:]
But there's a whole lot of trouble all around
Every night the same old siren sound
Ah there's a whole lot of trouble all around
Children, soldiers, in this battle ground

[Chorus:]
Ah put it in
Ah bau bau
Put 'em bop
Ah put it in
Ah bau bau
Put 'em bop
Ah put it in
A bau bau
Ya ya

[Verse 3:]
Well a new sun
And a second chance
He unbolts the door
And hops ever the fence
Young woman with a baby
That her daddy gave her
Back in the neighborhood
Workin for the savior
But all around
The war rages on
Burnt out houses
With the front door gone
Well his faith is his fountain
His love is his neighbor
Back in the neighborhood
Workin for the saitor

[Bridge:]
Whoa oh oh oh, oh
Yea, ahhh,

[Chorus:]
Bau, bau
Put it on back
Ah put it in
Ah bau bau,
Put it ooh bop
Ah put it in
Ah bau bau
Put it ooh bop
Ah put it in
Ah, bau bau
Ya ya

[Outro:]
He got a new mercy
A new grace
Street corner preacher
With the angry face
He got two years off
For good behavior
Back in the neighborhood
Workin for the savior
