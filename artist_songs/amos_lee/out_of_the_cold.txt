It's hard to argue with a bullet proof vest
Cause you can't walk straight with a bullet in your chest,
Another man down with a flag to fold
Yeah, it takes a lot of lovin' comin' out of the cold.

Two tours served never once has he cried,
The same can't be said for his brand new bride,
Bills pile up with no hand to hold,

It takes a lot of lovin' comin' out of the cold,
Yeah, it takes a lot of lovin' comin' out of the cold,

Mmmm, mmm, mmm.

Looking at the pictures up on the shelf,
He feel a mere shadow of himself,
22 years still he feels so old.

Yeah, it takes a lot of lovin' comin' out of the cold
Yeah, it takes a lot of lovin' comin' out of the cold
Yeah, it takes a lot of lovin' comin' out of the cold
Yeah, it takes a lot of lovin' comin' out of the cold

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
