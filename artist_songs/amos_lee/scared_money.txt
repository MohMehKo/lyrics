If you've got scared money
Always lay it down
If you've got scared money
Run you out of town
If you've got the small stack, Jack
Best not be afraid
Either take the king down
Or get out of his way

They see you walking in
With a target on your chest
They see you at your work
But they want you at your best

Ain't nowhere to run
You in far too deep
The climb is far to high
The fall is far to steep

If you've got scared money
You always lay it down
If you've got scared money
Run you out of town
If you've got the small stack, Jack
Best not be afraid
Either take the king down
Or get out his way

So welcome to my world
Go on take a chair
There's demons in your drink
And evil eyes are everywhere
Only hope that you gonna have
[?] and well
Either bow down now
Or come in for the kill

Cause if you've got scared money
Run you out of town
If you've got scared money
You always lay it down

There's terror in your eyes
Too afraid to blink
You're too afraid to swallow
I know what you think
You're up against the wall
The killer in your sight
The read the death slowly
Get back up and fight

If you've got scared money
Run you out of town
If you've got scared money
You always lay it down
If you've got the small stack, Jack
Best not be afraid
Either take the king down
Or get out of his way
