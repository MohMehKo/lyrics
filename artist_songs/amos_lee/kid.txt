Been kicked around so long
You're starting to get used to how it feels
The taste of blood that's in your mouth
There's still somehow it always heals
Don't know how you keep on getting up
From all those ghostly blows
And all that pain that lingers
Deep down in the darkness where it grows

I know how hard it is
To keep your head up kid
To keep your head up
Kid

And there you sit on high
All tucked away and locked up in the clouds
Waiting for someone to finally
Come along and take you out
Into this bitter world
That also often treated you so cruel
When they turn away
You know that they will say that you're a fool

I know how hard it is
To keep your head up kid
I know how hard it is
To keep your head up kid

And so patiently
You waited for a love to come along
Take you out into this bitter world
So often done you wrong
There you sit alone
And there you shed a solitary tear
Listening to a song
You think that no one else would ever hear

I know how hard it is
To keep your head up kid
I know hard it is
To keep your head up
Keep your head up
Keep your head up
Keep your head up
Keep your head up
