Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy, please
Oh, yeah

Woke up this morning and the sky was colored gray
I gotta do a little bit better than I did with myself yesterday
Gotta keep myself from falling so far behind
Oh keep getting myself on down the line
Alright

Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy, please
Cause we're running out of time

Saw my name on tombstone in a dream that I had
Oh you know I'm running round everyday tired of feeling so sad and bad
I gotta get myself a little closer to no return
Oh I know someday these bones are bound to burn, alright

Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy, please
Cause we're running out of time

Oh that train come
Full speed ahead
It's a rumbling down the track
Well I know that train ain't stopped before
And I know that train don't know how to turn back, 
so I I gotta do a little bit better than a once I did

Oh stop hiding behind my hat like I'm a little kid
Keep on pushing down the road and do a little bit better
Than once I done

Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy, please
Cause we're running out of time

Oh, everybody, everybody
We're running out of time
Oh everybody, everybody
We're running out of time
Oh yeah
Have mercy, have mercy
Yeah
