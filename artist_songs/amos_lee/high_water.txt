Whole lifetime have come and gone
And I’m still here on my own
Don’t know when I’ll ever get back home
High water, high water, high water gonna rise

Newsman come on the air
Sponsored by a billionaire
Says folks please won’t you say a prayer
High water, high water, high water gonna rise

Lost souls breed and loot the stores
Doctors still searching for the cures
While I’m here waiting on these shores
For high water, high water, high water gonna rise
