The phone rings
And I don't care who it is that is calling
You moved our things from ours to his
While outside the snow is falling

The wedding band that meant so much
Signified our blessed vow
Like coffee spills and unpaid bills and all my pills
It's in a dusty dresser drawer now

I watched these trees from green to brown
Suddenly this small town has gotten smaller
The arctic breeze it sings to me, and says now look
Any fool can go out and walk on water

I shoulda known that time alone
Would only serve to break you down
Don't know why I sit and stare at that damn thing sitting there
In a dusty dresser drawer now

Snow has turned to water
To please the trees
And cheer up that late bloomer
While I'm sipping on a beer counting down another year
Couldn't come a second sooner

I wonder how easily that ring it slid off of your finger
Did you stop for a moment
Let the memory of us linger

Or was it just an afterthought
Like casting water from a bow
I'm past the point of crying
For a love that lies there dying
In a dusty dresser drawer now

It's such a goddamn shame
Right next to your picture frame
In a dusty dresser drawer now
If anybody asks me what I think, that love is for now, I'll tell them
Look in a dusty dresser drawer now
