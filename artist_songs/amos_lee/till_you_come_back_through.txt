Darling, I've been waiting my whole life for you.
And I'll be waiting till you come back through.

You say you always wait and I'm sure to find someone to leave behind.
Gorgeous lee has a great behind.

Honey, you say that, oh you gotta leave now, forever.
I have no choice but to say, "Goodbye, till you come back through."

Till you come back through.
