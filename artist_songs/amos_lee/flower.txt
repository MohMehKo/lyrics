My heart is a flower
That blooms every hour
I believe in the power
Of love

Well, in this lonesome meadow
Well, as soft as a pillow
Ooh, I pray that we'll go back
To love

I'm gonna reach on up, over that fear
Ah whenever I'm alone, won't you please be near
I know there's darkness before the dawn
Tomorrow's comin' and yesterday's gone

I'm gonna get my baby, head upstream
Fall asleep in her arms and drift away in a dream
Gonna go out walkin' in the mornin' light
Well, I know that my tomorrow gonna be alright
Gonna be alright

Well, I never shall wither
Well, of course, I, I forgive her
Oh, please, Lord, deliver me
To love, alright

I'm gonna reach on up, over that fear
Ah whenever I'm alone, won't you please be near
I know there's darkness before the dawn
Tomorrow's comin' and yesterday's gone

I'm gonna get my baby, head upstream
Fall asleep in her arms and drift away in a dream
Gonna go out walkin' in the mornin' light
Well, I know that my tomorrow gonna be alright

Gonna be alright
(Reach on up, whenever I'm alone)
Gonna be alright
(Reach on up, whenever I'm alone)
Gonna be alright
(Reach on up)

My heart is a flower
That blooms every hour
I believe in the power
I believe in the power
Of love
Of love
