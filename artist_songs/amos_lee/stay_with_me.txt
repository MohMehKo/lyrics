One by one we watched them fall, 
Like trees on the country side. 
Yeah you stayed right with me babe, 
The river was rolling tide 

Oh you stay, stay with me 
Oh you stay, stay with me. 

All through it with broken bones 
Oh how you watched them heal 
No you never turned away 
You were never afraid to feel 

Oh you stay, stay with me 
Oh you stay, stay with me. 

Oh and when the morning comes 
Just know darling, 
I had to be moving on 

Oh and when the winter comes 
Oh and you can't decide 
For your rabbit to run 
Or your rabbit to hide 

Stay, stay with me 
Please stay, stay with me. 
Will you stay, stay with me 
Will you stay, stay with me 
Will you stay, 
Stay
