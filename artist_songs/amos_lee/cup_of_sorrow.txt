I want to drink from your cup of sorrow, 
I want to bathe in your holy blood. 
I want to sleep with the promise of tomorrow, 
I know tomorrow may never come. 

I send a prayer out across the ocean, 
To a man that?s forced out of his home. 
I send a prayer out across the ocean, 
So that he may not suffer there alone. 

I want to drink from your cup of sorrow, 
I want to bathe in your holy blood. 
I want to sleep with the promise of tomorrow, 
I know tomorrow may never come. 

I want to sit at your table of wisdom, 
So that not one crumb shall go to waste, 
For if we keep down this pathway to destruction, 
Oh will our children will suffer for our haste. 

I want to drink from your cup of sorrow, 
I want to bathe in your holy blood. 
I want to sleep with the promise of tomorrow, 
I know tomorrow may never come [x3]
