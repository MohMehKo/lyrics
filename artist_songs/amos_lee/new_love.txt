Softer than the summer sun across my window
Oh she's lying there, as the violets will bloom
Round and round this carousel
I am underneath her spell
She's lying there silently
I'm patiently waiting
Wondering

If I can kiss her on her shoulder
It's just new love
It's just new love
I can smell last night's perfume
Like the sun up in the sky while the moon is still there
All these times to share

I can't wait to say good morning baby
What you wanna do today?
I can't wait to get you home
I'm gonna get you home, yeah
You alleviate my fears and my anxieties
You set my mind at ease, your sensitivities are free

Your sensibilities will see and I can't wait
I say too I can't baby
What you want to do today?
I can't wait to get you home, yeah
I'm gonna get you home, yeah
