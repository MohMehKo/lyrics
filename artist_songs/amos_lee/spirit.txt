Walkin' down Royal Street
A street singer symphony
Ain't been the hardest way
Ain't had the greatest day
Walkin' past memories

And the pain that she gave to me
Don't you know I'm tryin' to be the bigger man
I just wanna feel the spirit
I just wanna feel the spirit
I just wanna feel the spirit

Washin' over me
Me and Madame Laveau
Seen some people come and go
Seen a couple storm clouds pass
Seen a couple spells been cast
People trippin' down cobblestones
Marching bands and trombones
Everybody's out here waitin' on the second line

And I'm just fine
I just wanna feel the spirit
I just wanna feel the spirit
I just wanna feel the spirit
Washin' over me

Storm clouds out up ahead
Singin' songs of praise to raise the dead
I got a heart that was born to be
Broken down and wild and free
Johnny came in on a train
With not a dollar to his name

Just an old guitar case
And the bruises on his pretty face
Walkin' down a railroad track
He aint never comin' back
Said mama I don't know if I'm every comin' home again

But until then
I just wanna feel the spirit
I just wanna feel the spirit
I just wanna feel the spirit
Washin' over me
