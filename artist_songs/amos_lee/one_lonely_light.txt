Sometimes I get the feelin' like I just ain't a damn bit of good
Sometimes I get the feelin' like a better man than me never would
Just then a chord is drawn
And all the pain there is gone
There are storms and
there's storms and there's storms
through the night
Oh the waves how they rage
and they crash deep inside
Oh and when the wind howls
and you feel you've lost sight
You'll be guided back home
by one lonely light

Lonely light
One lonely light
Sometimes I feel as if the wheels are put here
just to stay in place
Sometimes I feel that I could disappear into the air out of trace
Just then a chord is drawn
And all the pain there is gone
There are storms and there's stor
ms and there's storms through the night
Oh the waves how they rage
and they crash deep inside
Oh and when the wind howls
and you feel you've lost sight
You'll be guided back home
by one lonely light

Lonely light
Oh I'll sing for you
What more can I do
Oh I'll sing for you
There are storms and
there's storms and there's storms
through the night
Oh the waves how they rage
and they crash deep inside
Oh and when the wind howls
and you feel you've lost sight
You'll be guided back home
by one lonely light

Lonely light
One lonely light
One lonely light
One lonely light
