I woke up in a box today
Just like every other day
And I just don't know where I should be

When will I be free

I grew up in the dark streets
Where voices called, voices go
You don't know your friends from your enemies

When will I be free
Oh, when will I be free

I want to go out
To the countryside
Find a little place for us
Find a little place for us
To run away and hide

Oh, the supervisor
His eyes are always red
He don't care if we live or die, he said

When will I be free
Oh, when will I be free

I want to go out
To the city of Rome
Or New York City
Oh, like Marilyn Monroe

And my love says to me
“Nothing's gonna change
You knowr where we were born
Is where we're gonna die, you see”

When will I be free
Oh, when will I be free
When will I be free
