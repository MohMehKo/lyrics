Come here my darling
Come on now
You may not be certain
You may not know how

We're all born strangers
This we can see
We may fear each other
But each other we need

So may I remind you, love
What is inside you, love
The whole world is turning black
The springtime is sunshine,
The flowers grow back
The flowers grow back

Baby my darling, your family
You may feel broken
But you're golden to me
Come to me softly, come to me strong
Just like a wind in the willows, singing it's song

Don't spend time wasted
Believing a lie
A love you were born with
Oh it never can die

May I remind you love,
What is inside you, love
The whole world is turning black
The heart that's inside you is coming back

So may I remind you
May I remind you
May I remind you, love
