I'm a stranger everywhere I go

They say the apple, it don't fall far from the tree, "Hey Daddy look at me"
Well I went back and I knocked on that door
But the man said that "You're momma, she don't live here anymore"
I'm a stranger everywhere I go

I ain't got no bags to pack
I ain't got nothing left to my name
I ain't got no goodbye letters
So I guess I'll get right on this here night train

I'm a stranger everywhere I go
I'm a stranger everywhere I go

And if anybody asks you if you seen me
Tell them that you never, ever seen such a man
And anyway, he ain't no friend in the end

well that scarlet lady, she tread upon my crown
I think it is about high time that I head out of the here harbor town
And I'm a stranger everywhere I go

I'm a stranger everywhere I go
I'm a stranger everywhere I go
I'm a stranger everywhere I go
