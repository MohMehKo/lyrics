When I am returning
Another day on the job
It's like a revelation coming home
seeing you sleeping with the light on 
mm hmm

It's just these simple things
keep me holding on
It's just these simple things
keep me holding on
I can't go back
right these wrongs
Oh, but these simple things keep me holding on
mm hmm

Well I know it gets hard, baby
Things get crooked and crossed
Sometimes I just get so hardly baby
I start feeling lost
mm hmm

It's just these simple things
keep me holding on
It's just these simple things
keep me holding on
I can't go back
right these wrongs
Oh, but these simple things keep me holding on

It's just these simple things
It's just these simple things
It's just these simple things
