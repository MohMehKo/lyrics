I've been waiting a long time,
I just hope that i might find.
The right kind of love, for me.
You know I've been lonesome,
God knows we all been lonesome.
Some people think that being lonesome really means being free.

But i would,
give it all up for you.
Yea i would,
give it all up for you.
Yes i would,
give it up, 
settle down,
stop looking around. 
I finally found,
something true. 

We live in a world full of confusion.
A culture based in illusion.
Some people think it's amusing,
but it's really just fantasy.

I would give it all up for you,
yes i would give it all up for you.
Yea i would,
give it all up for you.
Yes i would,
give it up, 
settle down,
finally found something true. 

I, I will give it all,
I will give it all up for you now baby.

I would give it up, i would give it up, i would give it all up for you now baby. [x3]
