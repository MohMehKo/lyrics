Meet this girl Luld down in Missoula
Boy,did we have a lot of fun.
Took me to her trailer, introduced me to her grandma
Who's drinking Kool-Aid out a water gun. 
Her grandmother's been smothered
By the love of a lowdown life.

Chicken's are clucking, down on their luck and
Drinking water out of rusty pipes.
Empty can of Stroh's, half-eaten bag of Cheetos
Little brother in the backyard nodding out on a shot
Her brother's been smothered
By the love of a lowdown life.

Her father, Roger, was a draft-dodger
Now he spends his days doing meth with his best friend Bobby Jim
When he gets that feeling takes to robbing and stealing
Parked cars from the Holiday Inn
Her father's been smothered
By the love of a lowdown life.
