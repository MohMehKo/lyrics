I don't know if I can do this alone
Oh after all our sweet love has flown
I've been running
I've been skipping like a stone
And I don't know if I
I can do this all alone

When I met her she was standing by a door
I ain't never seen a light like that before
Now she's left me for something more sure
And I don't know if I
I can do this anymore

'Cause lovers will come, lovers will go
And it's a rare seed, ah, from which true love might grow
If you see her, won't you please say hello
'Cause I don't know if I can do this alone
