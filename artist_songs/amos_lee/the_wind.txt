Saturday night and my head is spinning
I wonder whose heart I've been sinning for
A cold rain blows on my window
A soft scent gone from my pillow

One more step that I've been takin'
Yes and one more heart
I don't need no more breakin' of
The red lights how they all
Burnin' down the highway
I remember when the wind had blown my way

But the wind blew down my line
Yeah the wind blew down my line

The man on the street
Each day I'm passin'
A small bite to eat
Is all he's been askin' for
Cold stares is all he's been yielding
Oh and now I know that empty feeling

Yeah the wind blew down my line
Yeah the wind blew down my line
Yeah the wind blew down my line
