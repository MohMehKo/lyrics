A thousand empty window
And only half the lights are out
I wonder what these people's lives
What they might be all about

Do they got a lover
And could they have a family
Could it be their just as lonesome
As you and me

I wanna shout out
Shout out loud
Why don't you all
Just come on out
And we can
Tear it all down, yeah

White lights burning
Down an empty avenue
I wonder if their driver
Found someone he can go on home to

I wanna shout out
Shout out loud
Why don't you all
Just come on out
And we can
Tear it all down, yeah

Cause everybody's got a part in the game
And everybody's got a cross they can claim
And everybody's got somebody to blame
But we all must find our own way, yeah yeah

I wanna shout out
Shout out loud
I wanna shout out
Shout out loud
I wanns shout out
Shout out loud

Shout out loud, yeah, yeah
Shout out loud, yeah, yeah

Shout out loud
Shout out loud
Shout out loud
