Been some time
Since the first night I saw you
Had some good
Had some bad time since then
And through all of these moments that I've gotten to know you
I realized that I want to be a little bit more than your friend

And I wanna know
If you want to get together
Stay for a while
We can talk about it all
I wanna know
Cuz this feeling won't let me go

Stood around
While you dated that old fool Marcus
Whole time knew he wasn't no damn good for you, well.
Guess it's true sometimes we can all be a little heartless
But tonight, all I wanna do is make sweet love to you.

And I wanna know
If you want to get together
Stay for a while
We can talk about it all
I wanna know
Cuz this feeling won't let me go

Well, all those wasted nights you spend
Well, just crying all those tears
Well, I want you to know girl
I'm around
Yeah I'm here alright
Alright

I wanna know
If you want to get together
Stay for a while
We can talk about it all
I wanna know
'Cause this feeling won't let me go

I wanna know (I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know)
I wanna know
I wanna know (I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know)
I wanna know, baby

All of these feelings
No it won't
No it won't let me go
No it won't baby
It won't let me go
