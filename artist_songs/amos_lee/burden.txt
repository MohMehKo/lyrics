I never meant to be a burden
Oh I just worry more than I’d like to
I never meant to be a burden
Please forgive me if I’ve weighed on you

For so long I have lived amongst the shadows
Waiting for the sun to break on through
Oh it’s time I cast my oars and head out on these shores
And find some place where I can start anew

I never meant to be a burden
Oh I just worry more than I’d like to
I never meant to be a burden
Please forgive me if I’ve weighed on you

Oh forgive if I’ve weighed upon your back
It’s so heavy already without me
Going ahead into this abyss and find my own way out of this
So you can walk ahead more easily

I never meant to be a burden
But you're the light that is guiding me through
I never meant to be a burden
Please forgive me if I’ve weighed on you

Please forgive me if I’ve weighed on you
Please forgive me if I’ve weighed on you
