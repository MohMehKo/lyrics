I keep on livin',
to keep from cryin'.
I keep on dreamin',
to keep from dyin'.
I keep on trying,
I aint gonna stop.

Get right down to the bottom of the barrel and float back on top.

We all know someone,
whos always hurtin',
The sun is shinin', 
they draw the curtain. 
One thing for certain,
the pain aint gonna stop. 

You get right down to the bottom of the barrel and float back on top.

Cuz i know the grass,
is always greener in someone else's yard. 
And the world is so much meaner,
when your heart is hard.

I go out walkin',
in any season.
It could be rainin',
it could be freezin'.
I don't need no reason,
it's just so pleasin'.
And i can't stop. 

You get right down to the bottom of the barrel and float back on top.

Tou get right down to the bottom of the barrel and float back on top.
