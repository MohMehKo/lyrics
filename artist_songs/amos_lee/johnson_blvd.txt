Up on Main St, they built a highway
Changed its name to Johnson Boulevard
Up on Thursday down on Friday
People ask me why are things so hard
Times been hard though
From Laredo to San Jacinto
And its a long way back home

Theres an old train in a stock yard
Its like a graveyard of things come and gone
And the wind moves on a gravestone
Where the leaves gone
And everybody knows
Times been hard though
From Laredo to San Jacinto
And its a long way back home

Sometimes youre standing still
And the wind just beats you down
Oh and sometimes its just so hard 
to keep your two feet right there on the ground

Mothers faithful
She goes to church still
She prays on Sunday
And Mondays too
Fathers somewhere
On the back field
Thinking out loud
That this ain't nothing new
Times been hard though
From Laredo to San Jacinto
So why dont we just go back home

Why dont we just go back home
