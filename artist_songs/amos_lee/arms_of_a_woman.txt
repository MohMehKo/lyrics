I am at ease in the arms of a woman.
Although now,
most of my days i spend alone.
A thousand miles,
from the place i was born.
But when she wakes me, 
she takes me back home. 

Now, most days,
i spend like a child.
Who's afraid of ghosts in my mind.
I know, there aint nothing out there.
I'm still afraid to turn on the lights.

I am at ease in the arms of a woman.
Although now,
most of my days a i spend alone.
A thousand miles,
the place i was born.
When she wakes me, 
she takes me back home. 

A thousand miles,
the place i was born.
When she wakes me,
she takes me back home. 

I am at ease in the arms of a woman.
Although now,
most of my days i spend alone. 
A thousand miles,

When she wakes me,
she takes me..
Ya, when she wakes me,
she takes me back home. 
When she wakes me,
she takes me back home.
