Lately I, I've been heading for a breakdown
Every time I leave my house
Well, it feels just like a shake down
Between the street sweepers and the pushers, are the lawyers
Who may as well be butchers
Between the small timing hustlers who all seem to feed upon each other

[Chorus]
Oh God why you been
Hanging out in that old violin
While I've been waiting for you, to pull me through

Lately I, every time I try to lie down
Oh, my mind just gets away
I can't even close my eyes now
Between the big fish and ambition, and the lovers
Using words as ammunition
Between the warped planks I've been pacing endless
Impossible dream that I've been chasing

[Chorus]
