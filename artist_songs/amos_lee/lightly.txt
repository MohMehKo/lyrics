Met her on a Tuesday
Went out on a Friday night
Said she was lookin' for a love affair
And I was lookin' for a getaway flight
So we packed up a bag
And hailed up a cab
And I grabbed my guitar because
It was the only thing that I had
Well I learned to travel lightly

Babe, livin' alone
Some say that it's the hard way, mama
But it's all that I've known
And if I move fast enough, hopefully
Oh the darkness can't catch up to me
Hey, Hey, Hey

So we headed off the mainland
With the beating of a drum
She turned and smiled and said, honey
Where you from?
I said I'm from all over
But I was born in the wind
She turned and smiled and said
You're goin' home again
Well I learned to travel lightly
Livin' alone

Some say that it's the hard way, mama
But it's all that I've known
And if I move fast enough, hopefully
Oh the darkness can't catch up to me
Hey, Hey, Hey
Oh I hear that train
A comin' around the bend
Oh in the morning I'll be
Runnin' away again
Runnin' away, runnin' away again
When she woke up in the morning

With the rising sun
In her heart she knew
I'd be gone
But I wrote her a letter
With the words to this song
She read it on the balcony
While the wind was strong
Well I learned to travel lightly

Cause I was born alone
Some say that it's the hard way, mama
But it's all that I've known
And if I move fast enough, hopefully
Oh the darkness won't catch up to me
Hey, Hey, Hey
