The one I love is lost without the least bit of explanation
Just goes to show the futility of self-preservation
Now all I seem to see is all this war, and goin' amongst our nations
What good will it do

Now everybody wants to know the secrets to our salvation
Forever reading on and on, from Genesis to Revelation
Never stopping for a second to examine situations
After all that we've been through

And love it only ends
When there's nothing left to defend
Will we ever see, yeah, yeah
The common bond of humanity
Go on...

Get a landscape of famine and also of frustration
And children walking round without the proper means to education
And still up there on Capitol Hill they're passing all this legislation
For jails and bombs

Still we live behind these hollow walls of lies and segregation
People walking round without the proper means to medication
And still up there on Capitol Hill they're passing all this legislation
For jails and bombs

Anybody out there can hear my prayer
