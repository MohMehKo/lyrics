When I look into your clear blue eyes,
I could cry, I could cry.
When I think of what they've put you through,
You know it tears me up inside.

Left alone in your darkest night,
By the one you trusted most.
How come they expect you to,
Be such a gratious host

When you look upon that heart of shame
Now I have to face,
All these accusations, questions that are
Aimed at your disgrace

Now you are left in the darkest night
By the ones you trusted the most
But now just follow blind ambition
Like a promise of the unknown coast

When I look into your clear blue eyes
I could cry, I could cry
When I think of what they put you through
You know it tears me up inside
You know it tears me up inside
You know it tears me up inside...
