Farewell my sweet
Well the time that was coming
The road has begun to move beneath my feet
Good things come to an end
Well I hope through the pain
The heartache and strain we can still remain friends

Something about a southern girl
Make me feel right
In a Mississippi morning
She's an angel in flight
In a blink of an eye
She'll be out of your sight
Something about a southern girl

You're a soft melody
Well I swear that I heard
From a lost mockingbird stuck up in a tree
We got a lot going on
Even though I'm not here
Please don't shed any tears for me day when I'm gone

Something about a southern girl
Make me feel right
In a Mississippi morning
She's an angel in flight
In a blink of an eye
She'll be out of your sight
Something about a southern girl

I never meant to leave you lonely
It was only in your mind
Girl, I never meant to leave you lonely
It was only a matter of time

Something about a southern girl
Make me feel right
In a Mississippi morning
She's an angel in flight
In a blink of an eye
She'll be out of your sight
Something about a southern
Something about a southern girl
