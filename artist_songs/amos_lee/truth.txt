Well my woman, she showed up 
With your number on her hand 
Well I thought that I might call you up 
So we could deal with this man to man 

You better tell me the truth son, yeah 

Well he showed up down at the ballroom 
Walking slow and acting strong 
Well I said my friend I'll give you one last chance 
To admit that you done me wrong 

You better tell me the truth son, yeah 
You better tell me the truth son, yeah 

Now they got me here in the county 
With his blood still on my face 
Well the boys in blue they don't play no game 
All the sheriff said to me was this...

You better tell me the truth, son 
I'ma beat it out of you 
You better tell me the truth, son 
I'ma beat it out of you 

Now they got me here in the lockdown 
For a crime I did commit 
Well for my last call 
I called the number on my girl's hand 
To remind you not to forget 

You should'a told me the truth, son 
Make me beat it out of you 
You should'a told me the truth, son 
Make me beat it out of you 
You should'a tole me the truth, son 
Oh... 

Make me beat it outta you 
Make me beat it outta you 
Make me beat it 
Make me beat it 
Make me beat it 
Make me beat it out of you
