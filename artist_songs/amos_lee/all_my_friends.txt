All my friends,
all live in pain.
Longing for the warmth of chilhood,
to bring them home again.
All my friends,
got broken hearts.
And if the world's at stage,
we're searching for our parts.

We'll face the winds,
and break the strongest of trees.
And beckon for the sweet, soft,  summer breeze.

All my friends,
got broken wings.
never will you hear them asking why,
the cage bird sings.
All my friends,
they know how to live.
oh so much sorrow, 
so much love to give.

We'll face the winds,
and break the strongest of trees. Beckon for the sweet, soft, summer breeze.

We all know that storm is coming.
Everybody want to know which way to go.
i see the crowds running,
the winds gonna blow. 

All my friends, 
are dear to me.
Oh when the storm comes, 
they're as close as family.
All the friends,
are the ones i chose.
If i hear them knocking,
you know i can't refuse.

We'll face the winds,
and break the strongest of trees.
And beckon for the sweet, soft,  summer breeze.
All my friends.
