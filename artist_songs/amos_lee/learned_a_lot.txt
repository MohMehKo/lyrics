Hey baby! It's all gravy
We all do what we got to do
Hey darling! I'm broken hearted
I've been crying but my crying is through

[Chorus:]
And I've learned a lot
I've really learned a lot
Broken down on a bedroom floor
Yes I learned a lot
Really learned a lot
I hope you found what you were looking for

Spent a lot of time staring at the ceiling
Spent a lot of time talking to wall
Spent a lot of time chasing that old-time feeling
Spent a lot of time waiting on your call

[Chorus]

Oh and darling! The sun has been fallin'
Like the dust on some mid-Western plain
Oh and darling! Instead of runnin'
I think it might be time
You sit down
And deal with the pain

Late at night I sit and listen to the freeway
Rolling like a river on a distant shore
Nobody told me that living was easy
I ain't living in fear anymore

[Chorus]

I hope you found what you were looking for
