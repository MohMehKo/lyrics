I know it ain't been easy 
I know it ain't been good lately
All I'm askin' for you
Is just to be honest with me

She's writing on my walls
It's over
She's writing on my walls
We're through
She's writing on my walls
She ain't saying
Baby I'm not in love with you

Been a minute since we really connected
Got lost in the shuffle of our busy lives
I understand it happens
But I didn't think it would happen to us baby

She's writing on my walls
It's over
She's writing on my walls
We're through
She's writing on my walls
But she ain't saying
Baby I found someone new

My love's still here
After all these years
And all these tears
All these tears
Oh, after all these tears
Ain't nothing you can keep me away, baby stay
But I'm starting to think things ain't gonna work out

Baby it's okay
All you gotta do is say
The real way you're feeling about me
I'm a man
She's writing on my walls, it's over
She's writing on my walls

We're through
She's writing oh
But she ain't saying
Baby I'm not in love with you
