Well, the morning came like a freight train
Bearing down on me from a thousand miles of rail
Well, it came and gone and kept rolling on
Laying up all night with my tear-stained sheet as my veil

I don’t wanna see you again, I don’t wanna feel your breath
As you leaned on me so peacefully while we slept
And I don’t want the keys to our door, I don’t live there anymore
And I’ll do my best just to forget the dreams we dreamt

Well, the morning came with the pouring rain
And I felt just as empty as a pail
With the evidence and your crime confessed
Don’t seem right that it’s me who's spending nights in jail

I don’t wanna see you again, I don’t wanna feel your breath
As you leaned on me so peacefully while we slept
And I don’t want the keys to our door, I don’t live there anymore
And I’ll do my best just to forget the dreams I dreamt

If you feel a chill in the air
It’s my spirit hanging somewhere
and if you ever get scared
Look on the bright side
You got a new life

Now the evening’s come and I’m all alone
And I can’t tell if silence is my foe or my friend
Well, I’m holding on but I ain’t too strong
I gotta get some rest before that train comes back ‘round the bend

I don’t wanna see you again, I don’t wanna feel your breath
As you leaned on me so peacefully while we slept
And I don’t want the keys to our door, I don’t live there anymore
And I’ll do my best just to forget the dreams we dreamt
Dreams we dreamt.
