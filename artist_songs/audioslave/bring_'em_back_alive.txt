I was on my way to the center of the sun,
When I lost my wings and I fell into a crowd.
And they carried me to a hole in the ground;
And they buried me, where no one could see and no one would be around.

I am a virus. I live in silence.

I was on my way to a city in the clouds,
When I lost my mind and I had to settle down.
Then I had a dream of an island in the sea where the lepers die;
Where no one survives and no one can hear the cries.

I am a virus. I live in silence.

Just like heathens thinking, on our feet we'll believe in God.
with one step, two steps, three steps toward the graveyard;
On the high road to remembering, it seems that we forgot.

I am a virus. I live in silence.
