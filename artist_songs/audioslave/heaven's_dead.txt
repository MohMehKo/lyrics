Anchor the night, open the sky
Hide in the hours before sunrise
Pray for me not, I won't lose sight
Of where I belong and where you lie

[Chorus]
Heaven's dead when you get sad
I see your wishes fly
Out of time
For the best time you've had

Shipwreck the sun, I'm on your side
An army of one, onward we'll ride
And whisper your songs, birds to the air
We'll bury all of our burdens there

[Chorus]
Heaven's dead when you get sad
I see your wishes fly
Out of time
For the best time you've had
Heaven's dead when you get sad
I see your wishes fly
Out of time
For the best time you've had

Best time you had
For the best time you had
Heaven's dead when you get sad

[Chorus]
Heaven's dead when you get sad
I see your wishes fly
Out of time
For the best time you've had
Heaven's dead when you get sad
I see your wishes fly
Out of time

I'll take it all, arrows or guns
Hundreds or more to save you from one
Save you from one
And Where I'll be
Heaven's dead when you get sad
