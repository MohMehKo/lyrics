When I first came to this island
that I called by own name
I was happy in this fortress,
in my exile I remained
But the hours grew so empty
and the ocean sent her waves
In the figure of a woman
and she pulled me out to sea

[Chorus]
When you come down to take me home
send my soul away
When you come round you'll make me whole
send my soul away

On the altar of a sunrise
was a wedding in the waves
And inside her shown a young light
from her labor I was saved
Though I've traveled long in darkness
in her harvest I'm embraced

[Chorus]
When you come down to take me home
send my soul away
When you come round you'll make me whole
send my soul away

Now the spires and the gables
grow in orchards to the sky
And the blessings on my table
multiply and divide

[Chorus]
When you come down to take me home
send my soul away
Yeah when you come round you'll make me whole
send my soul away
Yeah when you come down to take me home
when you come round you'll make me whole
Yeah when you come round to take me home
Send my soul away
send my soul away
Send my soul away
send my soul away
