Somedays, somedays, somedays just ain't so easy

Wake up, look around just before your feet hit the ground
Where they make the oil and street, is where you stand and where you sleep
Black and whites along the lights, plain clothes and Miranda Rights
At the right place but in the wrong life, somedays just ain't so easy

Somedays, somedays, somedays (Somedays) just ain't so easy
Somedays, somedays, somedays (Somedays), somedays (Somedays)
Just ain't so easy

It's not the fault of anyone as we revolve around the sun
We sleep beneath the same sky but we all see it through different eyes
So if you go or if you stay, standin' still or if you walk away
If you bend or if you break somedays just ain't so easy

Somedays, somedays, somedays (Somedays) just ain't so easy
Somedays, somedays, somedays (Somedays), somedays (Somedays)
Just ain't so easy, they just ain't so easy
Oh yeah

Nobody say it's so easy, yeah
I don't care for somedays

Someone may have done you right or done you wrong
Or kept it down from the day you were born
There's no need to apologize for the riot in your eyes
Somedays just ain't so easy
Hey! Hey! Hey!

Somedays, somedays, somedays (Somedays) just ain't so easy
Somedays, somedays, somedays (Somedays), somedays (Somedays)
Just ain't so easy
