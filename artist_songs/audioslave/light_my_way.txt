In my hour of need
On a sea of grey
On my knees I pray to you
Help me find the dawn
Of the dying day

[Chorus]
Won't you light my way
Won't you light my way
Won't you light my way
Won't you light my way

A bullet is a man
From time to time he strays
I compare my life to this
To this I relate
And I'm willing
To listen to your answers
And I'm not afraid
To tell you I need you today

[Chorus]

So when I'm lost
Or I'm tired and depraved
Or when my high buller mind
Goes astray won't you light my way

[Chorus]
