When I was 18 I didn't know pain when the sun was high
Burnt face, shadow's erased and I knew I'd be alright
Left that behind me, uh-huh
Somethin' blinded me, uh-huh
Youâ€™re reminding me, uh-huh
Of a better space and time, miles away

The jewel of the summertime
Jewel of the summertime
Jewel of the summer-time
A jewel of the summertime
A jewel of the summertime
Jewel of the summer-time

When I turned 21 I saw the sun pulling out of sight
All that I met were dark silhouette's stumbling in the night
Then we collided, uh-huh
And I finally, uh-huh
Got a light on me, uh-huh
Now I'm bathing in the bright ultraviolet rays

Jewel of the summertime
Jewel of the summertime
Jewel of the summer-time
A jewel of the summertime
Jewel of the summertime
Jewel of the summer-time
Time, time

I left that behind me, uh-huh
But somethin' blinded me, uh-huh
You're reminding me, uh-huh
Of a better space and time, miles away

Jewel of the summertime
Jewel of the summertime
A jewel of the summer-time
A jewel of the summertime
A jewel of the summertime
A jewel of the summer-time
A jewel of the summertime
Jewel of the summertime
A jewel of the summer-time
Jewel of the summertime
Jewel of the summertime
Jewel of the summer-time
