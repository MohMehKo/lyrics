Now one fell asleep in the street and he never woke up
And now one died in pieces in his bed with a mouth full of bones
And one threatened me long ago, I saw him melt in the bright light of day
And one laid to rest in a field under starlings and crows

I've been wandering sideways
I've stared straight into the sun
Still I don't know why you're dying
Long before your time has come
Your time has come

Now one took some bullets in the chest in a deal gone wrong
And one got a little too depressed and he went and jumped the gun
One got shot right in the face and he somehow survived
But he doesn't know my name or who I am and I'm not surprised

I've been wandering sideways
I've stared straight into the sun
Still I don't know why you're dying
Long before your time has come

I've been wandering sideways
I've stared straight into the sun
Still I don't know why you're dying
Long before your time has come

I've seen 50,000 names all engraved on a stone
Most of them met an early grave years before I was born.
All of them left brothers and sisters and mothers behind
Most of their family and friends are still alive and doing time.

I've been wandering sideways
I've stared straight into the sun
And I don't know why you're dying
Long before your time has come

I've been wandering sideways
I've stared straight into the sun
And I don't know why you're dying
Long before your time has come
Long before your time has come
Long before your time has come
And your time has come
