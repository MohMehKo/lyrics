He was standing at the rock
Gathering the flock
And getting there with no directions
And underneath the arch, it turned into a march
And there he found the spark to, set this fucker off

Set it off 
Set it off now children
Set it right
Set it off
Set it off now children
Alright
Set it off
Set it off now chldren
Set a fire
Set it off
Set it off now children

Suddenly a shot
Ripped into his heart 
He lay in need of some attention
And there he played his card
 Going into shock
The last thing that he said was, set this fucker off

Set it off
Set it off now children
Set it right
Set it off
Set it off now children
Alright
Set it off
Set it off now children
Set a fire
Set it off
Set it off now children
Alright, alright, alright. Alright, alright, alright

Jesus at the back door
Everything is all right
All we need is some direction
Every time the wind blows, everything you don't know
 Turns into a revelation
And it all adds up inside your head
Time is wasting

Set it off
Set it off now children
Set it right
Set it off
Set it off now children
Alright
Set it off
Set it off now children
Set a fire
Set it off
Set it off now children
Alright, alright, alright. Alright, alright, alright
