And when you wanted me, I came to you
And when you wanted someone else, I withdrew
And when you asked for light, I set myself on fire
And if I go far away I know, you'll find another slave

now I'm free from what you want
Now I'm free from what you need
Now I'm free from what you are

And when you wanted blood, I cut my veins
And when you wanted love, I bled myself again
Now that I've had my fill of you, I'll give you up forever
And here I go, far away, I know you, you'll find another slave

Cause now I'm free from what you want
Now I'm free from what you need
Now I'm free from what you are. Hey

Then a vision came to me, when you came along
I gave you everything, but then you wanted more

now I'm free from what you want
Now I'm free from what you need
Now I'm free from what you are. Hey
now I'm free from what you want
Now I'm free from what you need
Now I'm free from what you are
