Listen now, let me speak
I will be the dog at your feet
And come along when you call
Be the little bird in your straw and sing you a song
I'll be there to take the fall
Though you tread upon me for no reason at all

[Chorus]
But just when you think you've left me blind
I will keep you in the corner of my eye

I will never leave your side
Though you call me your number one zero
your nevermind
I'll be your king, I'll be your pawn
I will builid a pedestal and put you upon it

[Chorus]
But just when you think you've left me blind
I'll be creeping right up behind
Cause if I need to
I will keep you in the corner of my eye
corner of my eye

Down on the street, over your night
Out of your sleep, out of your sight
if I need to, if I need to
Out of your mouth, in every word
Down in your ego one thing is sure
I will keep you, I will keep you

[Chorus]
But just when you think you've left me blind
I will be creeping right up behind
Cause baby if I need to
Lord, I will keep you in the corner of my eye
I will be the bird in your straw
But you won't get far
I will keep you in the corner of my eye
