The first time I saw you
You were chasing down
A cyclone
All alone in a field
With rail yards and clovers
I kept rolling on and never thought
You'd wind up chasing me

[Chorus]
Well settle down I won't hesitate
To hit the highway
Before you lay me to waste
Settle up and I'll help you find
Something to drive
Before you drive me insane

You're tired of walking and you
Loathe the ground
Teh sidewalk will barely
Touch your feet and life moves
Too slowly to hold you down
With rining hands
You take it out on me

[Chorus]

So get yourself a car and drive it all night long
Get yourself a car and ride it on the wind
