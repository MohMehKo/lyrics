Thought I was different and it seems I'm just the same
As a game I put my hand over the flame
I thought I was smarter as I flew into the sun
But it turned out the way it does with everyone

Oh, oh
I don't fly around your fire anymore
I don't fly around your fire anymore
Burnin', fallin' down so many times before
I don't fly around your fire anymore

I love the heat I love the things that I forgot
I love the strings that tie me down and cut me off
I was a king, I was a moth with painted wings made of cloth
When did the flame burn so high and get so hot?

Oh, oh
I don't fly around your fire anymore
I don't fly around your fire anymore
Burnin', fallin' down so many times before
I don't fly around, fly around
Fly around

I don't fly around your fire anymore
I don't fly around your fire anymore
Burnin', fallin' down so many times before
I won't fly around, fly around

I won't fly around your fire anymore
I don't fly around your fire anymore
Burnin', fallin' down so many times before
I don't fly around, fly around
Oh
Fly around, oh
