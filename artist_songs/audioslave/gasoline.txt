House is haunted
I just want to go for a ride
Out and on
Before I set this room alight
Left alone forever and for crimes unclear
With my patience gone
Someone take me far from here. Yeah

Burning that gasoline, yeah
Burning that gasoline

New day yawning, another day of solitaire
House is honest, clearly more than I can bear
Drag me off, before I set my world on fire
Out and gone the sun will never set tonight. Yeah

Burning that gasoline, yeah
Burning that gasoline

No what for's, only a can
Of red says danger on it 
I have found another way

Burning that gasoline, yeah
Burning that gasoline
Burning it all away, burning it all away
