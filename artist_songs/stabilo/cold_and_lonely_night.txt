Ideals of every man,
I can bake my bread and what I can,
And with that, "Come look at my castle and my car."
Ideals of every man, 
Should I bake my bread and steal what I can,
I wouldnt lie but sometimes true is not the opposite of false.

And with that complicated notion, with your alibis and emotion, 
If its too much for one session, 
I will use my indiscretion. 
So breath a lot, 
I know that it's all I've got. 
The lights are on inside my head, 
And I'm ready for dead. 
So breath again, 
Don't tell me I'm your only friend, 
Take a minute just to sit right back and relax again. 

Gravity, 
Well it seems to be so clear to me, 
Doesn't any others see. 
Its a luxury, its worry free, 
Yesterday I called my friend, 
My enemy. 

And with that complicated notion, with your alibis and emotion, 
If its too much for one session, 
I will use my indiscretion. 
So breath a lot, 
I know that it's all I've got. 
The lights are on inside my head, 
And I'm ready for dead. 
So breath again, 
Don't tell me I'm your only friend, 
Take a minute just to sit right back and relax again
