I know, we know, that you are here for me 
You see all the things I do to be the one who sees you in your bed 
Sometimes I wake up and I can't see a thing 
I'm left in the dark alone, but then I hear your sweet words 
And my dreams are left inside of my head 

I know we're all like eachother and ya your like me to 
So I cross my heart and hope you cry 
But it only matters if I do 

Help me help me ya to see the things I do and i'm tryin 
I'm near as pure as the God that created you and placed you with me 
My heart has been tryin to speak to you for years 
I've held back because, I've never talked to an angel 
But I see one when I look in your eyes 

I know your not trying in your actions, ya your just being you 
So God help me if I'm wrong 
But I love all the things you do 
So take me into your arms, let me hold your hand 
Can you feel me close to your heart? 
Take to the sky, spread your sings come along 
If I were you I could fly, can you hear me? 
Or do i need to cry? 
And you do all the thing, all the things 
Money cannot buy, it cannot buy 

I know, we know, ya that you are here for me 
You see all the things, the things I do to be 
The one who sees, you in your bed 

And I look in your eyes, I look in your eyes 
Ya you breathe me, you feel me, you see what I see
