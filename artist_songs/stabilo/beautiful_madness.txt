I will go on. You take me to your land 
Time will go on. It breaks me, 
in your life 

Say what you wanna say, any time of day, 
but don't justify my truths 
It's time for me to change, time for hope 
to bleed, time for love to sacrifice, 

Oh and madness didn't change the fact 
that we fell apart 
It could've been love 
but we had a rough start 
I could've held back, 
but you were already there 
You didn't have to wait, 
and I don't have to care. 

Time will go on. 
It breaks me in your life 

Say what you wanna say, any time of day, 
but don't justify my truths 
It's time for me to change, time for hope 
to bleed, time for love to sacrifice, 

Oh and madness didn't change the fact that we f ell apart 
It could've been love 
but we had a rough start 

I could've held back 
but you were already there 
You didn't have to wait 
and I didn't have to care 

Oh and madness didn't change the fact that we f ell apart 
It could've been love 
but we had a rough start 

I could've held back 
but you were already there 
And if you never look back 
you never quite care 

But you caught my eye and 
stole a thousand teardrops 
You told me so many times. 
But I can taste his blood 
My hands are tied 
The nails are in my pocket 
This world was made for kings and queens 
and I alone 
So tie me up and spike another coffee 
Bring out your dead alive 
wasted for the lines 
For the times I've walked 
for the times I talked 
For the times alone, alone, alone 

This beautiful madness, 
this glorious sadness 
This time to share... 
Na na na...
