When I'm sinking like a stone 
How far will you let me fall 
Before you pull me back to your body
You'll never know until you breathe my breath
What it really means to be alone
When I'm going down
How long will you let me drown
Before you put the lid back on the bottle
Stay away I leave with the emptiest feeling
I'll never be seeing you again
When I'm breaking all my bones 
Jumping off of window sills
Will you be there to put me back together
When I can not talk 
And all the words are caught in my throat 
Can you hear me still
Stay away I leave with the emptiest feeling
I'll never be seeing you again
Right about the time I stopped trying 
To emulate a god I found out 
I'm not tired scream a crash collide
Someone died on the road tonight
I hope they're alright
I get my friends for free 
Although theyre all to good for me 
I'm not depressed 
Just obsessed with myself
