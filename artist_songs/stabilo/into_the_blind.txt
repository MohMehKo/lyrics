A long way to run. 
A long way to go on someone else's word. 
And not by any sane decision. 
And you've shown that you can lead, 
And I've shown I can bleed. 
I speak more about the crime and not about the consequences. 
You say I'm easily tired, 
Well I'm already tired. 
Its not that you bore me, 
Its not that you're cold, its just me. 
A crime's been commited justice will be served, 
But its none of my business. 
I try not to care but caree creeps up and sweeps me away. 

But I know what I got, 
And I'll take it off what's not. 
Little by little, 
I change but stay the same. 
I'll paint your picture and I'll leave it on a wall. 
I'll make you a melody, 
And I'll sing it when you call. 
Like a rose, 
I don't mind. 
I don't mind, 
I don't mind. 

I know I know, 
You show you show, 
Places, times and in between, 
And anything in moderation. 
So breed the past, 
Any day awake or any time alive, 
It's all about your conversation. 

Walk all alone on a sun-sinking day, 
And I've already faded. 
But the memory's fall fast, 
And the feeling is past, it's ok. 
Into the blind on the tip of my tongue, 
Its my house and I'll burn it. 
So bake my own soul on a stake and let me return. 

I know what I got, 
And I'll take it off what's not. 
Little by little, 
I change but stay the same. 
I'll paint your picture and Ill leave it on a wall. 
I'll make a melody and I'll sing it when you call. 
Like a rose, 
I don't mind, 
I don't mind, 
I don't mind
