Friendly faces, welcome almost any day. 
Light up a smile and realize it's not too late to change your mind. 
Take a train, swing from a threat, mother natures muddy water rolls right off my head. 
Mr. Mystery passes by and says, "Son I'm glad you're still alive today." 
So am I, why would Mr. mystery care about me anyway. Why would Mr. mystery care about me anyway?

When tears fell like rain, 
I'm licking my lips. 
I'll never understand it. 
That's just the way it is. 
I've been running from these demons for most of my life. 
I can still feel them watching me in the middle of the night. 

So you say that you do not know me. 
I do not know myself. 
What I am or who I'll be, so don't try to make sense of me. 
So you say that you do not love me, I do not love myself. 
I never wanted to be the one tying you down, but I really do hope that you are happy now. 

When tears fell like rain, 
I'm licking my lips. 
I'll never understand it. 
That's just the way it is. 
I've been running from these demons for most of my life. 
I can still feel them watching me

I want to be here forever, 
I want to be young forever. 
Lets dance the sky together on another day. 
If you go and you just don't see, 
I want to be you and you want to be me, 
Come on everybody and dance with me. 

Climbing mountaintops, 
I had a thing for you. 
Your enchanting smile and your eyes are cool. 
You would fall behind, 
I would wait for you. 
Everybody's gone ahead, 
I just smile and shake my head. 
You don't know who you are, 
You will never know. You will never know.

If you go and you just don't see, 
I want to be you and you want to be me, 
Come on everybody and dance with me
