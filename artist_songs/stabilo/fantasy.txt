Driving intoxicated anticipating blurrier visions of Christ 
Are you the saviour that brings us our daily bread? 
Some of us wine, others rice 
See through a crack in the darkness 
See dark in the day, day 
See what we sacrifice for progress 
See masks that we wear, wear 

On the edge 
You said that it was tragic the way I turned you in 
Into a fantasy 
For a day 

I am the window and you are the stone that was thrown at my head 
You said you see through me better when I'm broken I just want to be erased 
Create fantasies just to help you get through the day, day 

You better escape or we'll scalp you 
We fought the world 
Come on, lets play 

On the edge 
You said that it was tragic 
The way I turned you in 
Into a fantasy 
For a day 

See through a crack in the darkness 
See dark in the day, day 
See what we sacrifice for progress 
See masks that we wear, wear 

Create fantasies just to help you get through the day day 
You better escape or we'll scalp you 
We fought the world 
Now come, lets play 

On the edge 
You said that it was tragic 
The way I turned you in 
Into the fantasy
