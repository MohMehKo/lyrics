Doesn't anybody know how to walk anymore? 
Doesn't anybody know what a radio is for? 
Doesn't anybody wear their hair down low? 
Doesn't anybody know? Doesn't anybody know? 

Doesn't anybody hate it when the street light turns red? 
Doesn't anybody want five more minutes in bed? 
Doesn't anybody, doesn't anybody have a letter to send? 
Doesn't anybody wish they had just one more friend? 

'Cause everybody wants, and everybody needs 
Everybody asks for one more piece 
Everybody wants to hear someone say please 
'Cause everybody takes, and everybody steals 
Everybody cries when something feels 
Everybody is looking for the drug that heals 

Doesn't anybody wanna take another shot at me? 
Go ahead the gun is loaded and the bullets are for free 
Doesn't everybody spray perfume to cover up a smell? 
Doesn't anybody know where to go to get some help? 

'Cause everybody wants, and everybody needs
Everybody begs for self esteem 
Why don't you get your mind out of the past?
And everybody takes and everybody steals
Everybody's been kicked by other heels

Please raise your hands up in the air

Oh in the air yeah 
Why don't you raise your, raise your, raise your hands in the air?
Why don't you raise your hands up in the air?

'Cause everybody wants

Doesn't anybody know how to walk anymore? 
Doesn't anybody know what a radio is for? 
Doesn't anybody wear their hair down low? 
Doesn't anybody know? Doesnt anybody know? 

'Cause everybody wants
