Oh no, go get your guns 
We'll all fight like cowboys and pray like nuns 
Then we'll dance around the open flames 
If it gets too hot then we'll have no shame 
No shame 

And you say we talk to much 
Cause nothing changes, nothing changes [mumble]
So we don't talk enough 
Cause nothing changes, nothing changes, and no 
Oh Oh Oh Oh 
And no no 

So wait here, sound the alarms 
Throw up your arms 
We've brought the entire army and we're starving 
So don't try 
Anything smart 
There's plenty of ammunition and we've got our guard 

Look now he's on the run 
Well I'm glad he tried, it's much more fun 
If we chase until the sun goes down 
We can take him out with no one else around 
No one else around 
No one else around 
No oh 
Oh no no 

So wait here, sound the alarms 
Throw up your arms 
We've brought the entire army and we're starving 
So don't try 
Anything smart 
There's plenty of ammunition and we've got our guard 

Stick around I've got a hunch 
We'll bomb this town and stop for lunch 
And never, Nevermind those awful cries 
It's not as real if you don't look in their eyes 
Don't look in their eyes 
Don't look in their eyes 
Oh no 
Oh no no 

So wait here, sound the alarms 
Throw up your arms 
We've brought the entire army and we're starving 
So don't try 
Anything smart 
There's plenty of ammunition and we've got our guard 

Don't look in their eyes 
Don't look in their eyes 
Oh no 
Don't look in their eyes 
Don't look in their eyes 
Oh no
