If it was up to me, I’d never look both 
Ways before crossing the street 
If it was up to me, I’d never wear my 
Seatbelt, and I’d probably still speed 
If it was up to me, I never would have 
Smiled in any pictures 
I’d most likely sleep all day 
If I could just relax for awhile 
So you better come quick 

I’m about to do something foolish 
If you could be so kind 
As to call the police 
I swear this time 
It’s not just for attention 
But I also know that you have heard that 
From me once before 

If it was up to you, 
I would never swear around people 
I’m supposed to respect 
If it was up to you, I’d keep in touch with 
Friends from the past 
Even though they never last 
If it was up to you, 
I’d always say my prayers before I ate 
And before I went to sleep 
If it was up to you, I’d be happy and I’d 
Write songs that made you happy too 
I can’t seem to care much for these things 
That you call life 
So you better come quick 

I’m about to do something foolish 
If you could be so kind 
As to call the police 
I swear this time 
It’s not just for attention 
I don’t want the topic to change 
I couldn’t ever tell you, to your face 
That I’ve only been pretending 
To enjoy this place 
It’s all been make believe 
And it’s mostly in my head 

The problem is we only guess 
Where we go when we finally rest 
Will it be better than where we are now 
Still I’d like to believe 
It’s better than here 
Better than where we are 
Better than here 

We’ve forgotten what we’re here for 
Or maybe we never knew 
If a simple life is what we want 
Why are we so confused? 
Cuz we all want a happy ending 
But we’re tired of children’s books 
We’re tired of feeling useless 
And we’re tired of dirty looks 
I swear we used to feel things 
Or at least we cried real tears 
We used to say I’m sorry 
But we haven’t now for years 
So forgive us of our sins 
Before we make our move 
Let us die in peace 
So we never have to choose
