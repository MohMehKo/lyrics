Spin round the steering wheel the 
Coffee spills but you can't feel 
The dam behind your eyes 
Turn off the radio, the news is fake 
But you can't tell who's 
Making up the lies 
Waking up to find... 
Waking up to find... 
You don't love life 

Mary-anne you're late 
I've been waiting for you for three days 
I'm beginning to be afraid 
I've been looking out the window 

Your smoked cigarette is your slow suicide 
And you only speak to pass the time 
But time's been passing you 
The days feel like they're getting shorter 
The nights are definitely getting colder 
I don't know what you're going to do 
Waking up to find... 
Waking up to find...you don't love life 

Mary-anne you're late 
I've been waiting for you for three days 
I'm beginning to be afraid 
I've been looking out the window 

And I don't know how this happened 
I remember laughing 
At the zombies who had no fun 
Now you've turned into one 
I don't know if it matters 
That we're hanging from the rafters 

Mary-anne you're late 
I've been waiting for you for three days 
I'm beginning to be afraid 
I've been looking out the window 

I asked you what do you think you'll find? 
You said nothing but you didn't mind 
It's all just smoke and mirrors 
I asked you where do you think you'll go?Ñœ 
You said Nowhere but at least I know 
I'm having trouble holding back the years.
