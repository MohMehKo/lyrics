Lights on the horizon, 
Pedal to the floor. 
You're driving nowhere fast, 
To chase away the past, 
But still it haunts you. 
Keep this old car moving, 
The spirits are at the door. 
Opiate eyes and summer skies. 
The gravel road it melts like pavement. 
With the dawn arriving I can rest my bones. 

I see the mirror on the water, 
Looks like my daughter bring me something sweet to eat. 

With the sun rising, 
I can be alone. 
Cracker Jack, 
Needle smack, 
Ten thousand miles a minute got me thinking, 
Got me thinking.

I thought I told you that the sky was falling. 
And I predicted that you'd come crawling. 
Just put the pieces on the shelf for next year. 
Save the rain and your tears my dear. 
I can see for miles. 
Because the moon illuminates this lonely highway, 
I can see for miles. 
Your smile illuminates my lonely eyelids. 

Driving thru the desert and the darkness drags me in. 
The blinding light of rage, 
Open my cage, 
I'm on front stage. 
Reflection of the moonlight on my pale burning skin.
I close my eyes, 
I visualize myself asleep and dreaming. 
Faces by the roadside whisper in my ear. 
Someone drives up next to me, 
And I shout at the top of my lungs 
"Can you hear me?" 
I try to ignore them but they're coming in too clear. 
Cool, cold crazy souls all trying, 
They're all dead but they're not lying, 
They're not lying. 

I thought I told you that the sky was falling. 
And I predicted that you'd come crawling. 
Just put the pieces on the shelf for next year. 
Save the rain and your tears my dear. 
I can see for miles. 
Because the moon illuminates this lonely highway, 
I can see for miles. 
Your smile illuminates my lonely eyelids. 

So alleviate the pain, 
Breath again. 
I know you, like a bridge over water. 
And you know me too, 
You're like the roller in the coaster. 
I know you!
