You must be made of straw 
The way you bend 
You're afraid of windy days or any breeze 
At all it never ends 

We run too much 
And we shake too many hands 
Now all our thumbs are broken 
And our toes too sore to dance 
But when our minds are sharp 
And our teeth are clean 
We focus on the past 
And we don't say what we mean 
It's then that we gain perspective 
It's then we realize where we went wrong 

Oh oh oh oh 
Don't be so cold when I kiss you 
Oh oh oh oh 
Don't be so bold as to miss me 

Strange how words 
Seemed to only make things worse 
So let's speak without our tongues 
And we'll sing without a verse 
Until your eyes are red 
Until my stomach hurts 
Until we're bleeding from the silence 
And the salt has stained our shirts 
Until there's pleasure in our pain and our 
Sadness leads to gain, again, again 

Oh oh oh oh 
Don't be so cold when I kiss you 
Oh oh oh oh 
Don't be so bold as to miss me 

We must be made of glass 
The way we break 
We crumble into pieces 
When we leave too much at stake 
But when your mind is closed 
And our heads are sore 
We've buried all the laughter 
And you're walking out the door 
Think back to a time when time was a place 
Where a thought was a dream 
And a dream was a hope for time
