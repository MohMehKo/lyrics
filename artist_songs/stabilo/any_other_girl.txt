Then the other girl,
Was sitting on the sidewalk in the rain,
She had a suitcase,
And a shoelace on her finger,
And she sang.

La da de la da da da

I cant remember to,
Forget about the face of you,
Cuz your words ring,
And the sign says,
All I am is ugly in the pane.

Any other girl,
Would sit along the sidewalk and complain,
With a rude face,
Made of white lace,
Always wondering who to blame.

You always understand,
A bit to late,
A line to straight,
For certainty,
For boys like me,
You just cant seem to balance out the scales.

But I know,
I'm always improving,
But still no it's satisfactory,
And I know,
You're almost perfect but still,
I'm not, I'm not, not, not

And do you make faces in the mirror,
Smiling some,
And watching your hair grow.
I'm always waiting,
Anticipating,
Life on the ice,

And I know,
I'm always improving,
But still oh it's satisfactory,
And I know,
You're almost perfect but still,
I'm not, I'm no, not, not,

If you were alive,
And I was a prayer,
Well then maybe I'd have faith,
But you're not alive,
And I have said my prayers so sleep.

I don't want my name in lights,
I just want to sleep tonight,
I never asked for this name,
I never asked for this life,
For this life,

And I scream,
Cuz you let me,
And I lie,
Cuz I'm bored of the truth,
And I'd like to tell you,
About love,
About life,
And I scream,

And I scream,
Cuz you let me,
And I lie,
Cuz I'm bored of the truth,
And I'd like to tell you,
About love,
About life on the ice,

I've screamed,
Since you left me,
And I've lied,
Cuz I'm scared of the truth,
And I'd like to tell you,
About love,
About life, life,

I've screamed,
Since you left me,
And I've lied,
Cuz im scared of the truth,
And id like to tell you,
About love,
About life,
Oh no no
