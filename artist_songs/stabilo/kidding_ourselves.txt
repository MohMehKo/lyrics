And I, I wanted to tear down the curtains 
To let, let in some natural light 
I wake up and open one eye 
And wait for the window to crack at me, alone 

And I, I wanted to curl up beside you 
And die, at least for an hour or more 
Depending on how you react 
Depending on how you respond to me 
I'll stick around 

We're kidding ourselves kidding ourselves 
So what do you want from me 
'Cause as long as there's a payphone and a taxi cab I'm alright 'cause I can leave home 
We're kidding ourselves kidding ourselves 
So what are you waiting for 
'Cause even with a fast car and a cellphone I won't leave 'cause I'd be alone 

So tonight, let's be as bold as we want to 
And drink, drink 'til we fall down the steps 
Remember how that made us laugh 
Remember how all that we did was laugh, and cry 

Well, we're kidding ourselves kidding ourselves 
So what do you want from me 
'Cause as long as there's a payphone and a taxi cab I'm alright 'cause I can leave home 
We're kidding ourselves kidding ourselves 
So what are you waiting for 
'Cause even on a bullet train or a jet plane I won't leave 'cause I'd be alone 
And I'm lucky to find cardboard in an alleyway that I can call home 

So tonight, let's be as bold as we want to run, four eyes ohhh 
We're kidding ourselves kidding ourselves 
So what do you want from me 
'Cause as long as there's a payphone and a taxi cab I'm alright 'cause I can leave home 
We're kidding ourselves kidding ourselves 
So what are you waiting for 
'Cause even on a bullet train or a jet plane I won't leave 'cause I'd be alone 
I'm lucky to find cardboard in an alleyway that I can call home 
So don't take your eyes off me, don't look away 
I won't be alone 
At home
