I used to be an angel, I used to talk to God 
I used to believe in miracles, a miracle went wrong 
I used to be a space boy, ya a race boy 
I used to be on fire 
Now you tell me your not worth it, I'll tell you your a liar 
Your a liar, your a liar 

But I am free, I stood upon the edge and looked over 
And thats me, that pretty face so out of place, 
That broken smile somehow worthwhile 
Add it up and then we're away 

But I wanna hear you laugh, I wanna see you cry 
I wanna wipe the tears that fall from your eyes 
I saw you last night, you said you'd be there today 
One minute your gone, the next you will stay 

I'm not proud of most of my friends, 
Oh there just like me, 
But I don't blame them for my actions, 
And we're closer than the sea, then we'll see, ya we'll see 

But I am free, I stood upon the edge and looked over 
And thats me, that pretty face so out of place, 
That broken smile somehow worthwhile 
You say that your gone but you wait for me, 
Ya you me, I'm leavin, but you wait for me 
And you know that I'll wish you away 

But I wanna hear you laugh, I wanna see you cry 
I wanna wipe the tears that fall from your eyes 
I saw you last night, you said you'd be there today 
One minute your gone, the next you will stay 

I woke up this morning and I said to myself, 
How you gonna change the world if your stuck upon the shelf? 
Its the big things I remember, the little things I forgot 
But if you add it all up, that's a hell of alot 

But I wanna hear you laugh, I wanna see you cry 
I wanna wipe the tears that fall from your eyes 
I saw you last night, you said you'd be there today 
One minute your gone, the next you will stay
