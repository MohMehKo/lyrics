Excuse me miss, I seem to have lost track of time, 
What just happened, how long have I been lying here 
Sprawled out on my back, you just confirmed my biggest fear 

I'm sick and tired of being this way 
I know how much you hurt and God you know how hard I've tried to change 
Right all along, you told me I was fading 
Nothing left for them to say, good luck, your gonna need it boy 
You'll need it babe, if your going ot live that way 

I don't believe in love, you don't owe me anything 
Believe me when I say, that I can change some day 
I don't believe in love, you don't owe me anything 
If you need a place to hide, I am on your side 

I know its hard to find an open mind 
The wisest ones were left behind 
We thought we had it all 
They knew exactly how we'd fall 
I thought we'd see them on the other side 
The flames they rose high up to our kness 
We tried to hide behind the light 
I want to be alone and on my own 
And roll the holy bones 
I want to feel alive and strong on the outside 

I don't believe in love, you don't owe me anything 
Believe me when I say, that I can change some day 
I don't believe in love, you don't owe me anything 
If you need a place to hide, I am on your side
