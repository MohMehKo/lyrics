You couldn't find two people more 
Different on the shores of love 
And wading in together is dangerous 
'Til she grabs you by the wrist 
Disarms you with a kiss, and you 
Forget about the angry shadows hanging 
Round your neck 
But we're giving it all anyway 
Though it may be a mistake 
We're swimming between the waves of 
Happiness and disaster 
And I don't know any other way than to 
Live just for the day 
Then let the shadows come 
And carry me away 

We're floating in between the stars 
As I'm kissing all your scars 
That made you beautiful and strong 
And me not relate 
When we finally wake up, after coming down 
You'll find the angry shadows have tied 
Me to the ground 

But we're giving it all anyway 
Though it may be a mistake 
We're swimming between the waves of 
Happiness and disaster 
And I don't know any other way than to 
Live just for the day 
Then let the shadows come 
And carry me away 

We're never far from the battle 
And you never shine in my shadow 
No we're never far from the battle 
And you never shine in my shadow 

Now we're finally finding out 
What we got ourselves into 

But we're giving it all anyway 
Though it may be a mistake 
We're swimming between the waves of 
Happiness and disaster 
And I don't know any other way than to 
Live just for the day 
Then let the shadows come 
And carry me away
