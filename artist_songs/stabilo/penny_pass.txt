See you talking to your Jesus, 
Please don't leave us, talk to Jesus. 
How'd you get to where you are, 
Did you have to take it so far? 
And when you're finished drowning in the night, 
I hope you make it out allright. 
How could I have known that I would throw that stone? 

She said, "I died yesterday, it's not as bad as you would say. 
Suicide is still alive and well and deep within me. 
We've tried to change a thousand times, 
These crazy kids they cannot lie. 
And as you open up the door and we lie broken on the floor." 

Pennypass on stained glass, got the ticket. 
Pennypass on stained glass, and a soul how do I get one? 

Now you've disappeared into the ground and you can never be found, 
Never be found.
I cut the rope before you come, 
I hid the guns but now you're gone. 
Now it's hard to carry on. 
I don't know what you were thinking, 
You're trying to play God. 

She said, "I died yesterday, it's not as bad as you would say. 
Suicide is still alive and well and deep within me. 
We've tried to change a thousand times, 
These crazy kids they cannot lie. 
And as you open up the door and we lie broken on the floor."
