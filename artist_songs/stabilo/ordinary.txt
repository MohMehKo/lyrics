How to tell, a friend that you've fallen in love 
watching her sing on the bow of a boat 
How to move, the muscles to open your mouth 
To admit to what she's been afraid of 

I'm sorry, I know I'm only ordinary, I'm not a star 
I apologize, I know this is an unpleasant surprise 
You need a star 

Can they tell when nobody says a sound 
When I'm lying, when I'm shaking 
Right beside 
A prophet who made up his mind 
To keep quiet 
Stay silent 

I'm sorry, I know I'm only ordinary, I'm not a star 
I apologize, I know this is an unpleasant surprise 
You need a star 

And to love, not to be loved, is the key 
And to see, not to be seen, that is me 
And to move, not to be moved, is to be free 
And to love, not to be loved is the key 

And to love (and to love), not to be loved (not to be loved), is the key 
And to see (and to see), not to be seen (not to be seen), that is me (that is me) 
And to move (and to move), not to be moved (not to be moved), is to be free (is to be free) 
And to love (and to love), not to be loved (not to be loved, is the key)
