Overcome by the enemy,
I run back up to my room,
Where I find your ruins,
And love, will you make a fool of me,
You got me doing things,
I never would believe.

Overcome by the enemy,
I run back up to my room,
Where I find your ruins,
And love, will you make a fool of me,
You got me doing things,
I never would believe.

So open eyes behind enemy lines,
Lie on my back and cross my fingers.

This room is my gravity,
Keeps me on the ground,
When I have no weight.

And trust,
Have you been misleading us,
'cause I believed when you said,
The enemy she is a friend.

Lets make a toast,
To our useless work,
And our hopeless cause,
To assess the damage of the loss.
