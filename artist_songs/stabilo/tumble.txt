One day the world stopped turning,
Turned inside out.
I lost my bearings,
And she lost her heart.
And as we were tumbling inside the void, 
I heard the silence and I also heard them say...
Hey now, my dear, 
Don't you know we prayed for you, 
When we went down and we're waiting up here till we meet again.

But until then....
Hey now, hello....
Calling all angels,
To bring some comfort back to the earth, 
And to hold her all through the storm, 
When she's tired and overwhelmed, 
Broken, 
And worn.
And it feels like the movies, 
When we're on the ground,
And everything's not alright but somehow there's peace to be found.

One day the world started turning again.
I opened my eyes and I'm down one best friend.
And if you should see her at least tell her this...
Hey now, my dear,
Don't you know I care for you?
And if your heart hurts,
It's only for a lifetime,
Then you rest.

But until then....
Hey now, hello....
Calling all angels,
To bring some comfort back to the earth, 
And to hold her all through the storm, 
When she's tired and overwhelmed, 
Broken, 
And worn.
And it feels like the movies, 
When we're on the ground,
And everything's not alright but somehow there's peace to be found
