And I want my pain back
And I want the world to see
There's nothing you can choose
Nothing you can lose
Except your free will to be

Better off as a stable boy
You're better off as a picture on the wall
You're better off believing,
You're a ghost
Than believing you can think at all

It may sound confused
But it feels good to me
It may be a lie
But I'm tired
And I'm right about ready to show no soul, no no

Rain, Rain for a while
Oh No,rain, rain for a while
'cause on your front porch is a letter from me
Revealing my own hell

So I change when the time is right
The right time's always few and far below
The right time is always wondering where to go, what to show, what to write about
And the world is on fire
Baby it's too good
I should not control my way to be
It's plain to see, I'm gonna be
'Cause I'm right about ready to show no soul

No, No, Rain, Rain for a while
Oh, No rain for a while
Rain
Rain

Because on your front porch there's a letter from
And the world is a girl in a beauty form
And a race is a place where it's singled out

So believe in yourself
Don't wait for ground to break
Wait for ground

It's ok to feel alone
It's ok to feel not strong
Once in a while

'Cause I keep telling myself what to feel
I play make believe until it's real
Oh most of the time
Because time was never too friendly to me
Somehow change just avoided to greet me
No, oh completely
And so when reality's taken its toll
Just pretend that you are not in control
Oh complacency
And so no
It's okay feel alone
It's okay to feel not strong
Oh once in a while
