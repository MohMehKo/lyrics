When I was a young boy
I was honest and I had more self control
If I was tempted I would 
Run
Then when I got older I began to lie to get exactly what I wanted when I wanted it
And I wanted it
Now I'm having trouble differentiating between what I want and what I need to make me
Happy
So instead of thinking I just act before I have a chance to contemplate the consequence of
Action

And I will turn off
And I will shut down
Burying the voices of my conscience hitting ground
And I will turn off
And I will shut down
The chemicals are restless in my head

Cause I lie
Not because I want to
But I seem to need to all the time (need to all the time)
Yeah I lie
And I don't even know it
Maybe this is all a part of my
Flawed design

And ever since I figured out that I could control other people
I've had trouble sleeping with both 
Eyes closed
And if I ask permission if I make sure it's ok I promise I won't slip up this time you can 
Trust me
But never take advice from someone who just admitted to being devious and just confessed to 
Treason 
And I would also never ask a question that I cannot ask myself for it might dirty up your
Conscience

Cause I lie
Not because I want to
But I seem to need to all the time (need to all the time)
Yeah I lie
And I don't even know it
Maybe this is all a part of my (flawed design)

And how can you say those things why can't you just believe
And how can you say those things and keep a straight face
And how can you say those things why can't we just believe
And how can you say those things and keep a straight face

And I will turn off
And I will shut down
Burying the voices of my conscience hitting ground
And I will turn off
And I will shut down
The chemicals are restless in my head

Cause I lie
Not because I want to
But I seem to need to all the time (need to all the time)
Yeah I lie
And I don't even know it
Maybe this is all a part of my (flawed design)

Cause I lie
And if I could control it
Maybe I could leave it all behind (leave it all behind)
Yeah I lie
And I don't even know it
Maybe this is all a part of my 
Flawed design
