I  want everything I see 
I want you to want me 
I want the water where you swim 
I want to drown in it 

I want your lust and favorite toys 
And all the girls and the beautiful boys 
Guardian angel when you sin 
I want everywhere that you've been 

Young and lonely 
I want to be your one and only 
Young and lonely 
Enough is never quite enough for me 

I want your clothing when you sweat 
I want the rain that makes you wet 
I want the drink that made you sick 
I want to choke on it 

Young and lonely 
I want to be your one and only 
Young and lonely 
Enough is never quite enough 

I want the road you travel on 
I want the turn where we went wrong 
I want the habit, you couldn't care 
I want to be owned by it, owned by it 

And the habit we couldn't kick, I'll be owned by it 
And the habit we couldn't kick, I'll be owned by it
