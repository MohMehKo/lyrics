Is it leaving time again? 
Tell me will we ever be back again? 
Down here on the water, in the dark I start to falter 
Break me of my confidence, break my nerve 
Down here on the corner, out on the curb 

Take a little time to mess with your mind, 
Or mess with mine and leave me where I stand 
Then walk away from here. 
Just another lonely face out on the block 
I don't ever want to see you talkin that talk 
Take a little time to mess with your mind, 
Or mess with mine you leave me where I stand 
Then walk away from here. 
Just another lonely face out on the block 
You don't ever want to stop and turn away
