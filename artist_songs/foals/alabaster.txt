She's up in the sky
She's up in the domes
She's up in the sky, up in the dome

I knew a girl who came from VillaLuz
Had a house filled with
Religious regret and infinite debt,
Heaven's pressure

She's a light in the dark
She's out of the door
She's up in the sky, up in the domes

Alabaster lover
(You go and get gone)
We make each other
(You go and get gone)

Alabaster lover
(You go and get gone)
We make each other
(You go and get gone)

She's up in the sky and the sky is on fire
She set the whole neighborhood to life
Then the people they'll read out all their names
Run away, run away, run away

And with victory the whole world would be ours
We will build nothing in it
Nothing in it

Alabaster lover
(You go and get gone)
We could make each other
(You go and get gone)

Alabaster lover
(You go and get gone)
We made each other
(You go and get gone)

Alabaster lover
We made each other
