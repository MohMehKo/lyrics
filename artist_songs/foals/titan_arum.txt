Sleep this off
sleep this off
your mind is just a loaded gun

you see
assasins on the walkway home
you eat yourself
from bones to bones
to tounges to toes
contractors nor the council
can find the time
to peice your head again

the terror we must
the terror we must
avoid and behold
avoid and behold
avoid and behold
avoid and behold
