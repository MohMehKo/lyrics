Up up and away

away from this town 
away from this town 
away from this town

these tunnels of bone
these tunnels of gold they lead me

I am a rocket
I am a rocket
you are an anchor.
down

out of my way
out of my way
you are my heart
I am the voice inside your heart

I know your mouth
you know my wounds
these warrens are dark
these warrens are long
these warrens go on and on and on

and so we go on
up up and away
away from this town
away from this town

I am a rocket
you are an anchor.
down

and had we arrived
we would have know
that there was no home 
there was no home
no home to go to

and so we sit here 
the heat of the sun
the heat of the sun 
the heat of the sun

we opened our skulls
all out to the sky
all out to the sky
all out to the sky
