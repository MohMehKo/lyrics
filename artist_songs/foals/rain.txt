The city can't wait 
I'll never sleep again
I've got plans today
Go out and make it rain
So the city can't wait
I'll run a hundred miles a day

Throw my thirst down the drain
Give up my name give up the game
Give it up now heartache
Give it up now again
I wanna run with the hounds
Wanna run with the hares
Get up now heartache
This city cant wait

No I'll never sleep again
This city can't wait
Cus I'm on my way
To a place of light and day
That I've no heartache

This city can't wait
And no I'll never sleep again
This city can't wait
This city can't wait
This city can't wait
