Hey, you could say the king is dead
We washed our hands of all we've read
We watch white stars overhead
We washed our hands of all we've read

Hey, you could say this king is dead
We've washed our hands of all we've read

One light fall awaits, everyone
One light fall awaits, everyone
One light fall awaits, everyone
One light fall awaits, everyone
One light fall awaits, everyone
One light fall awaits, everyone

EVERYONE, OHHHHHHHHH

Oh kalo
Oh kalo

We watch white stars overhead
All this pressure's into our head
We watch white stars overhead
So this language must be dead

ohhhhhhh

Oh kalo
Oh kalo

ohhhhhhh

Oh kalo
Oh kalo
Oh kalo
