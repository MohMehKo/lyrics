Helium heart, you're blown apart, you'll never find your shadow
Helium heart, your hands apart, you'll never trap your shadow
In the dark heal your heart, you're blown apart ravaged by the callow
From the start helium heart your hands apart, you'll never catch your shadow

So keep it up from the start in your hands apart
Flit splits such as from the star
You turn support, yeah, no call, no call me
Your hands in your, hands in your, hands apart
After dark, from the start, blown apart

Helium heart, you're blown apart, you'll never find your shadow
At the start helium heart, your hands apart, you'll never trap your shadow
In the dark heal your heart, you're blown apart, you're ravaged by the callow

Helium heat, you're blown apart, you'll never find your shadow
