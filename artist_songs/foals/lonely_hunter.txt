It's a new day just in time for me to say I'm sorry
For all the things I said I didn't mean
It's a new time, so why must I wait in line for what is mine?
It's a new day, why must it be the same?

Been gone too long, so don't wait up, it's 3 a.m., I got held up
Tried to call, I'm on my way
Will I see you? I've got lost in foreign lands
Tried to get back, oh, I hoped you understand
Just remember the love is a gun in your hand

It's a new year just in time for me to say
I'd be there but didn't make the grade to new time
So why must I wait in line for what is mine?
It's a new day always feels the same

Been gone too long, so don't wait up, it's 3 a.m., I got held up
Tried to call, I'm on my way
Will I see you? I've got lost in foreign lands
Tried to get back, oh, I hoped you understand
Wait forever for love is a gun in your hand
In the deep blue I'm a hundred miles from land
Treading water, it's too deep for me to stand
Just remember love is a gun in your hand

Just in time for me to say I'm sorry
Why must I wait in line for what is mine?

In the deep blue see the whitecaps from the shore
But I can't swim, and it keep me wanting more
Just remember love is a gun in your hand
Will I see you? I've got lost in foreign lands
Tried to make it back, oh, I hoped you understand
Wait forever for love is a gun in your hand
