You've got the blood on your hands, I think it's my own.
We can go down onto the streets and follow the shores.
Of all the people, we could be two.
Then I bite my nails to the quick, run back home.

You've got the blood on your hands, I know it's my own.
You came at me in the middle of the night to show me my soul.
Of all the people, I hoped it'd be you.
To come and free me, take me away.
To show me my home.
Where I was born.
Where I belong.

You've got the blood on your hands, I want you to know.
I hoped that you'd come and take me away, back to my home.
Of all the people, it had to be you.
Then I bite my nails to the quick, run back home.

You showed me.
Where to go.
To my home.
To my home.
So take me.
Through the roads.
That you know.
To my home.

(Come and help me accept it, affect it, protect it.
Come and help me accept it, it's always my home).
