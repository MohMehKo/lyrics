Another hot summer's day and only we know the way
To the cool blue lagoon where we sleep until noon
The city is all ablaze with blue notes and haze
We hit the open wide roads, we snub the moon and go

Get up again, get up again, get up again

We swim under the moon in the cool blue lagoon
You count up all my scars and crumble them into stars
You're such a perfect mess, you in your dirty white dress
In the day I can see, you up there again

Get up again, get up again, get up again, get up again

A perfect blue evening, we sit and drink and we sing
Smoke flowers rising high under the flaming sky
