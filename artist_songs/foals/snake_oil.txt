Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Yay, you keep it slow, yay-yay, you keep it low

Well, you sell snake oil to the butcher
The butcher's bill must always be paid
It's a wild wait to wait and it leads to no surprises
No surprise, no-one gets laid
You put the snake oil under my tongue
Show me the door, the way to be free
Cause you know the moves that only you do
Makes fools of a boy like me, ooooh, ooooh, yay, uh
You sell snake oil to the sinners
When all they crave is to be free
It's a wild tease, tease me with nothing better
Nothing better, slower than me
You cast a spell that keeps me wired
Keeps me red, keeps me on fire
So why do you take me down, down to nothing
Always out cold, never been higher, ooooh, ooooh

In the day uou leave me to want what I crave
No surprise to want what I can't find
You said it again, again, again
Come on, you said, you said it again

Driving through the old county line
Where I go to find what is mine
Driving past the old county line
Where I go to find what is mine, ooooh, ooooh
You said it again, you give it away

In the day uou leave me to want what I crave
No surprise to want what I can't find
