Sticks and stones don’t break my bones, you make believe
It’s lock and load, it’s a dead end road to you and me
You know what’s to go, I’m strict for soul, I make believe
And I’m off the rent, I haven’t spent, I guarantee

So can you not go away
If just for one day
Uh-uh-uh
Impossible, possible way
How would you do know
How’d you do now?
Run away
War sounds in you
Don’t throw your fortune away
And I can’t get enough
Space, space, space
Get enough space

I’m pale and coy, a mama’s boy, I make believe
I shimmy-shake, I wake and bake, I’m over me
My lungs are beat, I can not breathe, don’t follow me
You push and shove, I’ve had enough, don’t mess with me

So can you not go away
If just for one day
Uh-uh-uh
Impossible, ṗossible way
How would you do know
How’d you do now?
Run away
War sounds in you
Don’t throw your fortune away
And I can’t get enough
Space,
I can’t Get enough space
Space
