You can go
Out on your own
But they can take
That forked road

Oh, I'll fill their shoes
I tried out all their moods
God, I'm trapped
I'm on the moon 

(I'm on my own)

I'm the master pretender
I'm wearing his face
I'm wearing his ring
All hail the king

You don't know
What I'm yet to be
Oh, you'll see

Paving is laid
On that forked road

I'll take your coat
Then I'll take your king
