The city I was born in I left a long time ago
And we lost touch, grew apart, my friend
My heart's an old pole dancer, troubled romancer, you know
It's a subway chancer, a question with no answer

Come meet me by the river, see how time it flows
I'll meet you by the river, see how time it flows

And when we age shed our skin and grow
We shed our layers, spread our wings and go
My heart's an old black panther, corrupted financer, you know
It's a troubled romancer, a question with no answer

Come meet me by the river, see how time it flows
I'll meet you by the river, see how time it flows
Come meet me by the river, see how time it flows
I'll meet you by the river, see how time it flows

Oh, now the river runs away but I chase it (yeah)
Time holds no fear when I turn round to face it (yeah)
Oh, now the river runs away but I chase it (yeah)
Time holds no fear when I turn round to face it (yeah)
Come meet me by the river, see how time it flows
I'll meet you by the river, see how time it flows
Oh now the river runs away but I chase it
Time holds no fear when I turn round to face it
Oh now the river runs away but I chase it
Time holds no fear when I turn round to face it
