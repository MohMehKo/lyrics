We've been trying not to break this town
We've been trying not to make this count
And everytime we seem to get so close
It all comes tumbling down

And we've been fighting out through most our years
And we've been fighting out through most our fears
Sometimes forgetting what we're fighting for
But we'll keep fighting 'til we got no more
You, yeah, and me

We won't run, and we won't hide
We're going out tonight
The world is ours tonight

And I'm sure this is what I was made for
Try to tell me no, I'll tear down your door
And if these open doors are too close
Then we'll keep fighting 'til we got no more

And we've been fighting out through all our years
And we've been fighting out through all our fears
Sometimes forgetting what we're fighting for
But we'll keep fighting 'til we got no more
You, yeah, and me

We won't run, and we won't hide
We're going out tonight
The world is ours tonight
And we won't know
Where we'll go
We're staying out tonight
The world is ours tonight

I know money is hard tonight
But I know that we'll live it right
I know money is hard tonight
But I know that we'll live it right

We won't run, and we won't hide
We're going out tonight
The world is ours tonight
And we won't know
Where we'll go
We're staying out tonight
The world is ours tonight
