You call me in the night drunk
Say you'll save me from myself
And I know there's no one else I can rely on 
To cry on
Now I'm speeding through the lights caught
To save you from yourself
And I pray that I can help you to move on
To stay strong

You pull me back in to spit me back out
Disaster be the last time

Watching, waiting 
Loving, hating on you
On you
Laughing, crying 
Fucking, lying too
On you

And now I'm at your place
And I find you in a state
And there's wine stains on the floor
No I can't take this
No I can't take this

Watching, waiting
Loving, hating on you
On you
Laughing, crying
Fucking, lying too
On you

Watching, waiting
Loving, hating on you
On you
Laughing, crying
Fucking, lying too
On you
