Babe, you know I just got paid
I wanna take you away
I wanna have you all day

Don't pull back the sheets
I can stay here all weeks
Your loves to tiring
Play you on repeat
You make me complete, and girl

You make me feel alive
And I feel like I might die
If I don't have you tonight, you tonight, girl
You make me feel alive, feel alive, and girl

So what do you expect from me
And I'll did whatever you ask
Just please, please me

Don't pull back the sheets
I can stay here all weeks
Your loves to tiring
Play you on repeat
You make me complete, and girl

You make me feel alive
And I feel like I might die
If I don't have you tonight, you tonight, girl
You make me feel alive, feel alive, and girl

And girl, you say you cant stay
But girl, I wish there was a way
And girl, its such a waste
Coz the world needs to see your face

You make me feel alive
And I feel like I might die
If I don't have you tonight, you tonight, girl
You make me feel alive, feel alive, and girl

And girl, you say you cant stay
But girl, I wish there was a way
And girl, its such a waste
Coz the world needs to see your face
