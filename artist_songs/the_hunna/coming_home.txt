Yeah I'm fine, baby,
But I know there's more,
More that you need

When you're crying down the phone,
I know that you feel alone,
Even if my body's broke,
And all of my money's blown

I'm running home to you,
I'm coming home to you,
I'm coming home,
If you want me to

And I'm running home to you,
I'm coming home to you,
I'm coming home,
If you want me to

When your love is haunting me,
Nothing gets in between,
When your love is calling,
It's just what I need

When you're crying down the phone,
I know that you feel alone,
Even if my body's broke,
And all of my money's blown

I'm running home to you,
I'm coming home to you,
I'm running home,
If you want me to

I'm running home to you,
I'm coming home to you,
I'm coming home,
If you want me to

And I'm running home to you,
I'm coming home to you,
I'm coming home
If you want me to

And I'm running home to you,
I'm coming home to you,
I'm running home
If you want me to
You want me to
I'm cool
