You say deep down the odds are against us
But you feel way to good for me,
To good for me to give you up
And you say its tough,
There's always gonna be band stuff
And girl we haven't even started yet,
Gonna roll until we got nothing left,

Still got blood.

You always wanna do this
I don't wanna do that,
You always wanna call me
I don't wanna call back
And girl I'm just trying to be fair,
Ill give you all I can when I'm there
And I care, its tough
There's always gonna be band stuff
And girl we haven't even started yet,
Gonna roll until we got nothing left.

Still got blood.
We still got blood.
We still got blood.
Still got blood.

Still got blood.
We still got blood.
Still got blood.
Still got blood.
Girl I'm in fear, let me be
Still got blood.
Girl I'm in fear, let me be
Still got blood.
Girl I'm on stage, and you keep on calling me
Still got blood.
