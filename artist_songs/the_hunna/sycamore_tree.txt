Sitting under a sycamore tree
You turn those beautiful eyes to me
And then whisper so delicately

And you say what will become of us, my dear
And I'll smile at you and clutch your hand real tight
Coz your changing my life

I say our future is ours to pain
And I don't have much but I've got a lot to gain
And I wanna share it all with you
And I feel your heart go oo oo oo oo oo
It goes oo oo oo oo oo
It goes oo oo oo oo oo
If goes oo oo oo oo oo

And darling, you know we've got youth on our side
Lets have no worries or troubles in our minds, tonight
Lets take these moments day by day
And whats in store for us, who can say...

And I feel your heart go oo oo oo oo oo
It goes oo oo oo oo oo
It goes oo oo oo oo oo
If goes oo oo oo oo oo

And I swear I love you till the end of our days
And oooh I swear I love you till the end of our days

And I feel your heart go oo oo oo oo oo
It goes oo oo oo oo oo
It goes oo oo oo oo oo
If goes oo oo oo oo oo
If goes oo oo oo oo oo
If goes oo oo oo oo oo
If goes oo oo oo oo oo
If goes oo oo oo oo oo
