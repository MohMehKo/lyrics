Are you gonna you gonna you gonna you gonna rock my way
Oh are you gonna you gonna you gonna roll away
And are you

We won't get much sleep
And you'll get tired
Of the people we meet

But let's just go get high
We can make it if we try
If we try
All I wanna know is, all I need to know is

Are you gonna you gonna you gonna you gonna rock my way
Are you gonna you gonna you gonna you gonna roll away

Oh the girls are so sweet
And you fall in love
Week after week

But let's get turned all night
It will be the ride of your life
Of your life

And all I wanna know is, all I need to know is
Are you gonna you gonna you gonna rock my way
Are you gonna you gonna you gonna roll away
And all I wanna know is, all I need to know is
Are you gonna you gonna you gonna rock my way
Are you gonna you gonna you gonna roll away
And are you

Are you gonna you gonna you gonna rock my way
Are you gonna you gonna you gonna roll away...
