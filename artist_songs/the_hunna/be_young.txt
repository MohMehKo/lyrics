Same places, same frowns
Feels like we're floating around
Your dreams are starting to sing
Light does all that there'll be
It's tough with blind eyes
Sounds like I'm out of my mind
Our hometown's got you alone
If you don't leave you won't know
You've been here too long

Be young, be free
You got to be somebody
And be young, and be free

You said to me you're not strong
For this to work you aren't wrong
Everything you thought you would be
Turned out to not be reality
And we both know
You've been here too long
Follow your heart and let's go, let's go

Be young, be free
You got to be somebody
And be young, and be free
It's in you, it's in me
We don't need nobody to be young, to be free

So fuck everyone who knows me
Cause I ain't got time on my hands
Follow your heart and let's go

Be young, be free
You got to be somebody
To be young, to be free
It's in you, it's in me
We don't need nobody to be young, to be free
