You know if it gets to much and you start to feel scared
You know if you want me there then I will be there
These times all the parties start to feel like its getting dark only 
I lie with you let you know that I got you
You know if you want me there then I will be there

Oh she grows, in my mind, she knows

I know you needed, I know you feel it, I know you want it, 
you know I got it, got it bad for you
You know I needed, you know I feel it, you know I want it, 
you know I got it, got it bad for you

You know when you're done on the road and you're on your way home,
You know if you need me to care then I will be there,
I'll bed in your bed wearing red like the rose that you gave to me,
We don't have to talk, just fell my body baby,
You know if you need me to care then I will be there

Oh she grows, in my mind, she knows

I know you needed, I know you feel it, I know you want it, 
you know I got it, got it bad for you
You know I needed, you know I feel it, you know I want it, 
you know I got it, got it bad for you
I've got it bad for you
I've got it bad for
I've got it bad for you...
