Please help me find a reason 
For me it's always season 
Words can't describe all the things I feel 
I'm losing everyday 
Won't you come out and play 
Step in my world and you'll see what's real 

It's dark, it's cold, inside I know 
It's dark, it's cold, inside I know 

I've had enough 
I've had my fill 
It's time for you to learn what's real 

The heat I felt before 
Can't burn me anymore 
I know you will feel like I feel 
The heat I felt before 
Can't burn me anymore 
I know you will feel like I feel 
The heat I felt before 
Can't burn me anymore 
I know you will feel like I do 

I did not have a witness 
I cannot help but be this 
My destiny has been planned for me 
It's time to show you all 
There's something after all 
My future died in my history 

It's dark, it's cold, inside I know 
It's dark, it's cold, inside I know 

I've had enough 
I've had my fill 
It's time for you to learn what's real 

The heat I felt before 
Can't burn me anymore 
I know you will feel like I feel 
The heat I felt before 
Can't burn me anymore 
I know you will feel like I feel 
The heat I felt before 
Can't burn me anymore 
I know you will feel like I do
