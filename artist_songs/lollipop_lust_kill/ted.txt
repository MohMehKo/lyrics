Girl I want you, more than anything 
You look to the left, you look to the right 
You look all around, there's no help in sight 
You're all alone in my crazy world 
My sweet defenseless little girl 

Girl I want to, rub my libido all over you 
You look to the left, you look to the right 
You look all around, there's no help in sight 
You're all alone in my crazy world 
My sweet defenseless little girl 

Girl, you, you better run away, before I make you 
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay! 

These wounds I tear into you deep and real 
The scars left behind burn to reveal 
These wounds I tear into you never heal

Well I see you walk in the park but you don't see me 
Tailing you in my car but you don't notice 
Follow you to your house peek in your window 
I want to be with 
See you walk in the park but you don't see me 
Tailing you in my car but you don't notice 
Follow you to your house peek in your window 
I want to be with you 
I'm going to be with you 
You will be mine
