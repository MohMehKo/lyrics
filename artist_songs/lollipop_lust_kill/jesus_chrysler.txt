"You assholes goin' for a ride!"

Wicked priest in a crimson collar
Ridin' with the Devil in a Jesus Chrysler
Wicked priest in a crimson collar
Cruisin' through the desert in a Jesus Chrysler

[Chorus]
(Step on it!)
Jesus Chrysler!
Yeah lookin' for his victims praying for a sin
Jesus Chrysler!
Well if he's got your number it's trouble that you're in
Jesus Chrysler!
Murderin' is all that motherfucker wants to do!
Jesus Chrysler!
You better watch your back because he's comin' after you!

Wicked priest in a crimson collar
Ridin' with the Devil in a Jesus Chrysler
Wicked priest in a crimson collar
Cruisin' through the desert in a Jesus Chrysler

[Chorus]
(Step on it!)
Jesus Chrysler!
Yeah demon eyed headlights, black polished chrome
Jesus Chrysler!
Rollin' engines thunder, evil's on the road
Jesus Chrysler!
Laughin' as he kills like an evil clown
Jesus Chrysler!
Wicked priest says as he's got ya tied down!

[Sample:]
"The people who owned that car last...
Died in it".

Don't try to run
Lay down and get beat
Don't be afraid, I got what ya need
Murder is a riot
And torture is so sweet
Time to bite the bullet
