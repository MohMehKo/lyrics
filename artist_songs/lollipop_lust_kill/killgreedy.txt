I've got this evil feeling
It's overwhelming me
To build these devices
That cause your agony
I've this dirty needle
To pierce your skin so deep
I've got this rusty scalpel
To feel it just say please

I know your body needs me
And I will be your king
I'll give you pain and I'll do it once more oh yeah
Die mother fucker die

Dr. Killgreedy 
Pain so sweet to me
Got to make you bleed
Die mother fucker die
Dr. Killgreedy 
Pain so sweet to me
Got to make you bleed
Die mother fucker die

We've got molten metal dripping into forced open eyes
Taking out your teeth with a rusty wood file
Cutting off your skin as your tied down to the bed
Listen to you scream as I drill into your head
It's music to my ears when I hear you scream in pain
I will torture you till I've driven you insane
I am Killgreedy baby bleed, baby bleed
I am Killgreedy baby bleed, baby bleed, yeah
