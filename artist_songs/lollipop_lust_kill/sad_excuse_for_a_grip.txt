Its hard to say if I am alive

Disorder runs rampant in my mind
Loose thoughts slipping through my sad excuse for a grip
Random ideas bouncing around like a rubber ball in a rubber room
Uncatchable

My mind is going numb
My mind is going numb

I find myself tripping in your eyes

Delusions creeping up from behind
Sticking, probing, trying everything to falter me
These floating thoughts will trip me up; make you knowing me 
Psychopathically
Impossible

I have become
So mentally undone
I have become
My mind is going numb

You have tempted me forever

Suddenly my thoughts come into mind
It seems Ive found the problem that has been plaguing me
I think of pain I think of death 
And then I find my mind specificly incredible

I have become, I have become, I have become
So mentally undone
I have become, I have become, I have become
My mind is going numb

Dead girls bloom
In my garden of thought
Spreading and decaying
To become one with the silt of my mind

I have become
So mentally undone
I have become
My mind is going numb

I have become
So mentally undone
I have become
My mind is going numb
