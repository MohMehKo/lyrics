Write another song for the money
Something they can sing, not so funny
Money in the bank to keep us warm

Stick another grape in the juicer
Or fill your guts with grease and get get looser
You are what you eat , so eat it warm

Roll another joint for the Gipper
Get the Gipper high, he gets hipper
Stick it in his mouth and keep him warm

Elect another jerk to the White House
Gracie Slick is losing her door mouse
Take her off the streets and keep her warm

Fight another war if they make you
Squeal on a friend or they'll take you
The future's in your lap, so keep it warm...

Warm, here in your arms
Safe from all harm, where I belong
Warm, cozy and calm, another
Dawn together warm....

My woodie's broken down by the beach now
And TM's gotten far out of reach now
Tell the Mahareesh to keep it warm

George is suing Paul, suing Ringo
and immigration wants John and Yoko
All they need is love, to keep them warm

Kill another whale with your power
Or shoot a bunch a kids from a tower
Snipe them in there cars
Blood keeps them warm

Make a better world from the old one
Make yourself a baby and hold one
Hold her in your arms and keep her warm,
Keep her warm, Keep her warm,
Keep her warm...........
