Well, it started out way down south 
Took a left and headed on out 
It was movin' along very slowly 
'Cause it was travelin' by word of mouth 
Made a short stop in New Orleans 
Then it headed for the New York scene 
and the people there, they dug on air 
'Cause they found out just what it means, yeah to have... 

[Chorus]
Rock and roll music, sweet groovy music 
Well, it's the only kind of music 
That reaches right to your soul 

Here come a guitar-pickin' fella 
And he took them by the hand 
He said "Now, listen to me, everybody 
I got a message that you gotta understand" 
And then he took that brand-new music 
And he let it cross the U.S. of A. 
And now some folks laughed when they heard that sound 
But it looks like it's here to stay, and they call it rock 

[Repeat Chorus]

Rock and roll music
Rock and roll music
Rock and roll music 
Talkin' 'bout rock and roll, I like rock and roll, yeah 
Long live rock and roll, yeah, talkin' 'bout rock and roll 
Rock and roll, sweet groovy music 

[...and fade]
