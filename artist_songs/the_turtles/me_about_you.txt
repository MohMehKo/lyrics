Perhaps another time or maybe another place
Could have eased my mind
Would have never seen your face, or heard about you
But now you call my name and you’re reality

Though it’s hard to explain I know I’ll never be, without you
I know nothing about you
But I know, I don’t doubt your love and I know that it’s real
By God above I know how I feel about you

Got a handful of gold and a pocketful of dreams
A heart full of love and I know what it means to be without you
Come sit by my side and share with me all the feelings inside
And the things that you see, about you

I’d always know you’ll be here today
Waitin’ for me now
The time is right, so you’ll hear me say that for all my life
I’ll always stay, about you

I’d always know you’ll be here today
Waitin’ for me now
The time is right, so you’ll hear me say that for all my life
I’ll always stay, about you

About you
About you
About you
