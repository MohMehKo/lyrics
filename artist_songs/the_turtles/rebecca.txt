Met you brushing your hair with the wind
Riding your bike up on Mulholland Drive
Oh, I got a five minute rush
From you in your faded blue jeans

How many years is it you've been alive?
Oh, I'll take a guess
Rebecca, could it be eighteen, nineteen or so?
Ooh, Rebecca, will I ever know?

No way, how will I fit in your life?
How could you live with a man without change?
Too strange and too poor to be trusted
Busted a couple of times
Shaken a bit by the years on the road
And the women I've known

Rebecca, you'd have liked the name I gave to you
Ooh, Rebecca, if you only knew
Go home to your father's friend's straight sons
To your mother's friend's sweet ones
To the families, so well-to-do and so well-established
And

One day, you might wake up to a shock girl
What has it come to, this sensible life? The wife of a fool
Rebecca reading magazines in a chic salon
Ooh, Rebecca, where's Rebecca gone?
