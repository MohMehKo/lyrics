Girl, I know what he can give you
Every single day you will be
Wearin' Paris gowns and diamond rings
There is nothing he can't buy you
And I can not tell a lie
You know with me you'll never have those things

Glitter and gold
(Glitter and gold)
Never can keep you warm at night
Glitter and gold
(Glitter and gold)
Never can make a wrong out right
Girl, you're gonna find
You'll have my sweet, sweet lovin' on your mind

You'll be eatin' caviar
And ridin' in a chauffeured car
And all your friends will say, "How lucky can she be?"
He'll be keepin' you in style
But, you'll remember all the while
The happiness you used to have with me

Glitter and gold
(Glitter and gold)
Never can keep you warm at night
Glitter and gold
(Glitter and gold)
Never can make a wrong out right
Girl, you're gonna find
You'll have my sweet, sweet lovin' on your mind

Glitter and gold
(Glitter and gold)
Never can make a wrong out right
Girl, you're gonna find
You'll have my sweet, sweet lovin' on your mind

Glitter and gold
Glitter and gold
Glitter and gold
Glitter and gold
Glitter and gold
Glitter and gold
Glitter and gold
Glitter and gold
