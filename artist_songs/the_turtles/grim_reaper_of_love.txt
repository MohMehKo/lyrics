Oooooh- Oooooh – Oooooh- Oooooh- Oooooh

Movin' on slowly, sittin' forlornly
Looks through her window, clouds hide the sun
She thinks of her love, gone like the wild ones
She knows he'll never return

Grim Reaper of love, Grim Reaper of love
Grim Reaper of love, Grim Reaper of love
Killing the living and living to kill
The Grim Reaper of love thrives on pain; people beware

Oooooh- Oooooh – Oooooh- Oooooh- Oooooh

Missed her sadness of the loss of his loaning
But in his past thinking, love can't last
We were so happy, peaceful and dear
But now his life's a little miser

Grim Reaper of love, Grim Reaper of love
Grim Reaper of love, Grim Reaper of love
Killing the living and living to kill
The Grim Reaper of love thrives on pain; people, beware

Oooooh- Oooooh – Oooooh- Oooooh- Oooooh
