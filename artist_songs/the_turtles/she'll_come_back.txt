When she left me I felt my world crumble
All I have lived for have faded from sight
And though I say that I can live without her
I find myself crying at night

She'll come back, oh yeah, she'll come back
She'll come back, oh yeah, she'll come back
Don't you worry my friend, she'll come back in the end

Though I try to conceal all my heart breaks
Still one can tell what I'm feeling inside
And all my friends tried to comfort and help me
Regain what is left of my pride

She'll come back, oh yeah, she'll come back
She'll come back, oh yeah, she'll come back
Don't you worry my friend she'll come back in the end
