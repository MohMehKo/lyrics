Dub sheisty, I'm thirsty nigga, ready to eat
Lench Mob 'til I die if the world ain't ready for me
It's that Big Swang affiliate, got ya feelin' it
like 10 inches of ashey dick in fresher pussy, a nigga be killin' it
Peep the delivery, what I'm deliverin', more than the average
Parental Discretion, Dub is a savage
I'm harder than Michael Jackson dick in a daycare
And I'll beat a rappin' bitch up too 'cause I don't play fair
In the throne I sit, with a jar of Vaseline jackin' off
to my videos 'cause I'm on my own dick
Gettin' my jerk on 'cause y'all niggaz ain't gangsta
With them tight ass Mel-donna v-neck t-shirts on
Fuck all y'all, I'll put the slug in through your chest
W.C. bitch, I put the W in the West (Westside!)
Who got 'em shakin' like Parkinson Disease?
Dub Sizzle, ain't a nigga reppin' harder than me

Smokin' weed, gettin' the money with that hard liquor up in my cup
Nigga fuckin' it up, look it here

Now, duck down, gots to buck 'em down
Look around now, y'all done fucked up now
[BEEP] Here he come, clear the location
In the West Coast formation, back up outta the gangsta nation
Swervin' through L.A. and surplus hanky wavin'
Swangin 'til infinity 'cause niggaz can't fuck with me lyrically
Everybody Killa, nigga realize who you facin'
Quick to do you, run it through you with no lubrication
You're slap boxin' with a giant smokin' on a Newport
Forfeit and "Blow The Whistle", your arms is Too $hort

[scratching]

From L.A. loc, in a Range Rove'
Twistin' my zag up, back to act up
Holdin' the stainless, communicatin' with my fingers
It's the world famous, world famous
Concrete safari ass nigga, the kind to reach back
and slap all the S-Curl out you R&B ass niggaz
Haters won't say it but I'm one of the greatest
The most underrated, Dub fall off, I can't see or feel that picture
You got a better chance catchin' me in a Blood gang meetin'
with Clay Aiken, Johnny Guild and Little Richard
Believe me, niggaz can't see me, I'm the king of the city
Sippin' on Henny, fuckin' my competition if any
Lights out, any nigga around me pullin' the mic out
is like shit in a ass crack, he gettin' wiped out
Cube turned me up on the beat, so I could tell these niggaz
what it do and what they gettin' fuckin' with me

Shit talk, Crip Walk, Jack and the Bean Stalk
That's what you get when you fuckin' with me
Shit talk, Crip Walk, Jack and the Bean Stalk

I have keep him on the chain sometime 'cause he forget uh
The nigga forget he in the industry mayne, Crip loco cuh)

Loc who fuckin' with Dub? Look it here
Smokin' weed, gettin' money with the hard liquor up in my cup
