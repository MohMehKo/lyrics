[Verse 1: W.C.]
Dub Sizzle for Shizzle
A nigga fresh out the work and I'm clean as I whistle
I keep it cracking (keep it cracking)
I got these whores on the phone saying (Let's get it on, let's get it on)
Woo! clean! baby Dud Sizzle lean
C-Walking with a lean of the Sticky Green
I rep it right (Bang on!)
You want sex tonight, call the original shady (Grab on it baby)
Got my (Dubs up) I'm in the club like (FUCKED UP!) holding my cup
Got the tailor made air one Nikes with a twist
Big biting on my wrist (God Damn)
It's the return of the real and 07 turning the wheel
Chrome feet with the chrome grill (For Real)
In a wide body sum with my eyes blunted
Got a pocket full of hundreds, now which bitch want it? (Who?)

[Chorus: DJ Crazy Toones]

[Hook: Ice Cube]

[Verse 2: W.C.]
Drink! in my hand on the dance floor
Peep! I'm off that Hennessey playing with coke
Freaking! on this girl while I dance slow
Tattoo on her waist with her pants low
Now I'm.. reaching for that big brown Caramel (That ass)
Squeezing on that thick soft round tail
Creeping out the door with the ghost well
I'm a have her legs in air at the hotel
After that we're gonna blow and inhale
Keep it on the low, you got a man I won't tell (UHH!)
But when you bend over girl that thing is like BOOM! BAAM! (GOD DAMN!)
I keep them all sweating and stumbling
And man ain't nothing going on but a whole lot of sex and hustling (That's all)
A whole lot of smoke and drink
And got Forty Eight hours to play y'all
I live for the day y'all

[Chorus: DJ Crazy Toones]

[Hook: Ice Cube]

[Girl:] Hold Up! Hold Up Dub! what you're trying to do to me?
[C.T.:] Get your ass DRUNK! - [X16] [Rough Coughing]
[Girl:] You still got me throwing up
[W.C.:] Don't worry about it baby, I'm still gonna fuck your ass [laughter]
