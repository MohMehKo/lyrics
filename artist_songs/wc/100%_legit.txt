[Intro/Chorus: Eazy-E]
Bitches don't see I'm a hundred percent legit
And you know it ain't about all that bullshit
Bitches don't see I'm a hundred percent legit (Yeah!)
And you know it ain't about all that bullshit (Turn the Music up!)
Bitches don't see I'm a hundred percent legit (Uhha!)
And you know it ain't about all that bullshit (What?)
All of y'all can just.. (Come On!) all of y'all can just.. 
All of y'all can just SUCK my dick!

[Verse 1: W.C.]
Feeling good, gripping wood, laying upon the leather 
Sunny weather rolling with the windows down low
Hitting Kush, niggaz look, cause I'm drinking and blazing on that 
Roll that motherfucker, you know I'm blown 
Dice on the mirror, Dub Shiest call me the Power Steering 
Rolling up on these whores 
Pure and Vanilla on my passenger seat 
So I'm looking around, looking out for po po's
Dirty as a piss test; can't afford to get arrested 
Cause I know these niggaz wanna stretch me out long 
Cause I'm a Lench Mob rider with triple X.O.; wearing V.V.S stones 
Awww shit! - this independent game got my ass sitting on Chrome 
Dub-C; niggaz thought it was over cause I was gone 
But tell them motherfuckers I'm home!

[Chorus: Eazy-E]

[Verse 2: W.C.]
I see you niggas' lips moving around and moving around 
Preparing to shoot me down because I got the top down 
But I ain't giving a damn, I'm giving them a main ply 
Plus, I can't hear you because I got the loud sounds 
Reflection from the wet paint got them upset 
Hating me cause I'm moving around town 
But y'all ain't seen nothing, give way my hog 
Get to settle your ass to pound the ground
Fat stack, fat sack, joint is fat
Matter of fact, motherfucker I'm about to clown 
Front back, black Lac, and this black strap 
That have the choir singing to you in the black gown 
And I don't care what they say, I'ma hustle get laid, make money and lounge 
Niggaz thought it was over 
But see I just started tell them motherfuckers Dub's back around!

[Chorus: Eazy-E X2]
