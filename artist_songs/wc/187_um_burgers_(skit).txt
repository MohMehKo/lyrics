[Nate Dogg:]
I'm gonna roll (I'm gonna roll)
I'm gon' stay fly (I'm gonna stay fly)
I'm gonna bust (I'm gonna bust)
Hold my hood up high (throw my hood up high)
In the name of the streets
I'm gonna roll (I'm gonna roll)
I'm going rich ride (I'm going rich ride)
I'm gonna ball (I'm gonna ball)
Hold my hood up high
In the name of the streets

[Snoop Dogg:]
This the itty-bitty nigga from the city they call L.B.
What you know about the D-O-G?
I keep my peeps with a bag of treats
On the streets my nephews beat your beat and keep that heat
In the Cut..
