Six feet under struggling to breathe
I'm covered in the dirt on your mind
Digging deeper with every word that you speak
You're on to me, but honestly

I tried to warn you, told you that I was bad news, yeah
I never wanted to make a mess of everything

These lies, these dirty little lies
They're keeping me up all night
This time they're dragging me down
And I don't know how to turn it around, yeah
These lies, these dirty little lies
They're running right through my mind
If I've been dragging you down
I'm telling you now, I'll turn it around, yeah

Ah ah
These lies, these dirty little lies

Couldn't keep my hands to myself
Left a stain, now you might never be clean
Wish I could wash away all the hurt
I just messed you up with my words
And you believed, but honestly

I tried to warn you, told you that I've got issues, yeah
And I never wanted to stray but it was all so easy

These lies, these dirty little lies
They're keeping me up all night
This time they're dragging me down
And I don't know how to turn it around, yeah
These lies, these dirty little lies
They're running right through my mind
If I've been dragging you down
I'm telling you now, I'll turn it around, yeah

Ah ah
These lies, these dirty little lies
Ah ah
These lies, these dirty little lies

Maybe it's all in my head
And you don't see through me just yet
But sooner or later you'll regret
And sooner or later we ever met

These lies, these dirty little lies
They're keeping me up all night (Up all night)
I'll turn it around

These lies, these dirty little lies
They're keeping me up all night
This time they're dragging me down
And I don't know how to turn it around, yeah
These lies, these dirty little lies
They're running right through my mind
If I've been dragging you down
I'm telling you now, I'll turn it around, yeah

Ah ah
These lies, these dirty little lies
Ah ah
These lies, these dirty little lies
