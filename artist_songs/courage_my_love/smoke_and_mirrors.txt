I was fooled so easily
Smoke and mirrors got the best of me
But one thing is for sure
Nothing's ever what they seem
Fool's gold could never buy me anything
Can't rely on daydreams

But daydreams are all I have
And nothing can take that away from me, no
I fell asleep and I can't wake up
I just can't shake this feeling that I'm better off not knowing

Heaven knows I'll never see
How you do it; lying through your teeth
But one thing is for sure
You were never who you seemed
Fool's gold could never buy me anything
Can't survive on daydreams

But daydreams are all I have
And nothing can take that away from me, no
I fell asleep and I can't wake up
I just can't shake this feeling that I'm better off

I'm better off

But daydreams are all I have
And nothing can take that away from me, no
I fell asleep and I can't wake up (I can't wake up)
I just can't shake this feeling that I'm better off not knowing
I'm better off not knowing!
