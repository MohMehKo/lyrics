You let the wind in when you opened the door,
And soon I knew it would become a storm.
Still haunted by the ghosts of all the boys I let in before.

I found a safe place in you

I buried my heart; hid it deep in the ground,
And in the soil I let it drown.
And when I thought all my luck had run out,
You brought it back when you came around,
'cuz love is either in your heart or on it's way
To a safe place in you.

I found a safe place in you.
