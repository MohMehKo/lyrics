(...Don't you know it's still better than drowning?
I'll never let this go)

You've been sinking like a stone below
And I've been trying to keep your head above

Cause when the water comes rushing in
It's not easy to know if you should sink or swim
Yeah when the water comes rushing in
Don't let go, don't you know it's still better than drowning?

I'll never let this go

I won't let you sink
When you're drowning
Sink
When you're drowning
I'll never let this go, I'll never let this go
I'll never let you sink to the bottom
To the bottom

You've got demons, yeah I know you do
But I won't let them get a hold of you

Cause when the water comes rushing in
It's not easy to know if you'll come back from it
Yeah when the water comes rushing in
Don't let go, don't you know it's still better than drowning?

I'll never let this go

I won't let you sink
When you're drowning
Sink
When you're drowning
I'll never let this go, I'll never let this go
I'll never let you sink to the bottom

Don't you dare for a second longer
Think that it was pointless diving in
Cause I swear you will come out stronger
I've never let you go

When the water comes rushing in
When the water comes rushing in

Don't sink
When you're drowning
Sink
When you're drowning
I'll never let this go, I'll never let this go
I'll never let you go
Sink
When you're drowning
