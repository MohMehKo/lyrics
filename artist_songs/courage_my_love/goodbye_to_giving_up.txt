Tonight I'm cutting ties 
cracked lips and bloodshot eyes, 
I've been compromised, 
knocked down, but I'm still alive. 
Tonight I'm letting go, 
I've given up on my last hope 
but I'll stay afloat 
because you feel like forever ago
Maybe one day we'll find home. 

Goodbye, say goodbye to giving up. 
Just keep your head up in the clouds 
this time I'll survive and laugh it off. 
Just hold your breath and don't look down. 

I can't believe I'm here again, 
burning bridges with all my friends. 
Well I can't pretend 
that I've never won in the end. 
I'm sick of this dead end town 
where everyone just brings me down.
Well it's over now, 
this time I'll turn it around. 
Maybe one day I'll let go.

Goodbye, say goodbye to giving up. 
Just keep your head up in the clouds 
this time I'll survive and laugh it off. 
Just hold your breath and don't look down.
