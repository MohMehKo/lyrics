I've seen cities burn,
I've seen tides turn right here in your eyes.
I can't imagine how, but we stand together now.
We'll make it through tonight.

We won't regret anything that's done or said.
We'll be here till there's no one left.
We're gonna be the last ones standing!

We held hands at the barricade,
as bricks shattered the windowpanes behind us.
This is our design
Our rebel yells became a voice;
This is our time, this is our choice, oh yeah!
This night is mine!
This is our night!
This is our night!

Here on these crowded streets
no order, no retreat, just fire in our hearts.
Where faith dies in front of me,
there's no place I'd rather be than here; in your arms!

We won't regret anything that's done or said.
We'll be here till there's no one left.
We're gonna be the last ones standing!

We held hands at the barricade,
as bricks shattered the windowpanes behind us.
This is our design
Our rebel yells became a voice;
This is our time, this is our choice, oh yeah!
This night is mine!
This is our night!
This is our night!

This night is mine!
(This night is mine!)
This night is mine!
(This night is mine)
This night is mine!
(This night is mine!)
This night is mine!
(This night is mine!)

(This night is...)
We held hands at the barricade,
as bricks shattered the windowpanes behind us.
This is our song
Our rebel yells became a voice;
This is our time, this is our choice, oh yeah!
This night is mine!
Tonight
