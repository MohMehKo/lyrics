Well I could never be 
The one who sits at home at the TV
Watching what others see
Terrified to live out my own dreams

Can you hear me now?
Are we loud enough?

Let's make this feeling last longer than tonight
For now, this crowd, we are alike
Seize it all and forget the past
We've got no reason left to fight
For now, we'll stand down
I guess I'll just dream til then
For now, let's just pretend

There I go about to jump the gun
Am I still making sense to anyone?
'Cause I've rambled on and on
And I can't say it all in just one song

Can you hear me now?
Are we loud enough?

Let's make this feeling last longer than tonight
For now, this crowd, we are alike
Seize it all and forget the past
We've got no reason left to fight
For now, we'll stand down
I guess I'll just dream til then
For now, let's just pretend

Let's make this feeling last
Let's make this feeling last
Let's make this feeling last
Oh, tonight!

Let's make this feeling last longer than tonight
For now, this crowd, we are alike
Seize it all and forget the past
We've got no reason left to fight
For now, we'll stand down
I guess I'll just dream til then
For now, let's just pretend
