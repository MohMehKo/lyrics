We've all got monsters
Underneath our bed
I know your closet
Full of skeletons
It must be lonely
Living in your head
So how did you get under my skin again?

Every time I let you in, I watched you walk away
Now and then I wonder if I saw you, what I'd say

Maybe I was too young
Maybe you were too stubborn
Baby, our kind of love
Is a two headed monster
Maybe you had in hard
Maybe I made it harder
Baby, our kind of love
Is a two headed monster

(Nothing but a two headed monster)

We've all got demons
Sitting on our back
It's hard to see them
When they're your better half
No one ever came close to you
And I don't know if I'm over you
Why do I keep thinking "what if" again?

Every time I let you in, you never want to stay
Now and then I wonder why you treated me that way

Maybe I was too young
Maybe you were too stubborn
Baby, our kind of love
Is a two headed monster
Maybe you had in hard
Maybe I made it harder
Baby, our kind of love
Is a two headed monster

(Nothing but a two headed monster)

I know, I know, I know
If I ask you to stay then this feeling won't go away
I know, I know, I know
If I hold onto your ghost, then you'll always be haunting me

I know, I know, I know
Why did it take me so long
I know, I know, I know
To say that I was wrong?

Maybe I was too young
Maybe you were too stubborn
Baby, our kind of love
Is just a two headed monster
Maybe you had in hard
Maybe I made it harder
Baby, our kind of love
Is a two headed monster
