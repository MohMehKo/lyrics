I've been listening
I've got my ear to the ground
I haven't heard a single sound that's familiar
Your always whispering but your voice is not your own 
At least its not the one Ive known
And I hope that someday you retrace your way back to me 
Don't say it's too late for us 
It's not to late for me

Ohhhh

High and low I've been looking for you 
Tell me where did you go to
I I moved so slow but I'm not moving toward you 
Oh I just want to know you

So are you coming clean
I'd give anything to know 
Now that you let your colors show
Are you still standing on your own 
Your still a part of me like the water in my lungs 
Your like the venom in my blood 
And I hope that someday you will retrace your way back to me
Don't say its too late for us 
It's not too late for me

Ohhhh

High and low I've been looking for you
Tell me where did you go to 
I I moved so slow but I'm not moving toward you
I just want to know you

Oh oh oh oh oh ohhh oh oh 

High and low I've been looking for you 
Tell me where did you go to 
I moved so slow but I'm not moving toward you 
I just want to know you 

Oh ohhhhh
