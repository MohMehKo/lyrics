(So this is where we are)
(So this is where we are)

So this is where we are
We're not at the end we're past the start
I keep my eyes on the ground
You put your hands in my heart

Cause when it's you and me
We can't decide what we should be
Should we just put this fire out
And cover it in kerosene

You and I could be brighter
Than a thousand hands holding lighters
(Woah oh oh)
Tell me you need me
(Woah oh oh)
And we'll burn like kerosene

You and I sparked an ember
This kind of love could go on forever
(Woah oh oh)
Tell me you need me
(Woah oh oh)
And we'll burn like kerosene

Yeah this is where we are
We're so much closer in the dark
Just when I'm safe in your arms
Then we unravel apart Oh

And honestly
Are you hearing me
It's so hard to say the words out loud
Can barely breathe
When you're here with me
And I need to know if you want this now

You and I could be brighter
Than a thousand hands holding lighters
(Woah oh oh)
Tell me you need me
(Woah oh oh)
And we'll burn like kerosene

You and I sparked an ember
This kind of love could go on forever
(Woah oh oh)
Tell me you need me
(Woah oh oh)
And we'll burn like kerosene

And we'll burn like kerosene

Put your hands in my heart

Then we are never apart

You and I could be brighter
Than a thousand hands holding lighters
(Woah oh oh)
Tell me you need me
(Woah oh oh)
And we'll burn like kerosene

You and I sparked an ember
This kind of love could go on forever
(Woah oh oh)
Tell me you need me
(Woah oh oh)
And we'll burn like kerosene

(Woah oh oh)
Put your hands in my heart
(Woah oh oh)
So this is where oh so this is where we are
(Woah oh oh)
Put your hands in my heart
(Woah oh oh)
So this is where, so this is where we are
