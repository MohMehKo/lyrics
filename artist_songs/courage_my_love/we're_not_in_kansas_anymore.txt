I can see the end closing in on the room
Can we go back again and re-discover our youth?
But I'm too scared to ask 
Is this all according to plan?
It's happening so fast

Why can't you understand 
We've got a crisis on our hands
Can't rely on a second chance
This time we're on our own
Click your heels, you're never coming home
Click your heels, you're never coming home

(2, 3, 4!)

I can see the end, it always shows up too soon.
Can we go back again and re-discover the truth?
But I'm too scared to ask 
Is this all according to plan?
It's happening so fast

Why can't you understand 
We've got a crisis on our hands
Can't rely on a second chance
This time we're on our own
Click your heels, you're never coming home
Click your heels, you're never coming home

The more we wait, the less things change
It's too late, it's too late
When you lie awake and count your mistakes,
It's too late, it's too late

Why can't you understand 
We've got a crisis on our hands
Can't rely on a second chance
This time we're on our own
Click your heels, you're never coming home
Click your heels, you're never coming home 

Why can't you understand 
We've got a crisis on our hands
Can't rely on a second chance
This time we're on our own
