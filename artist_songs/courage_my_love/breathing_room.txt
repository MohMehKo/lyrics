I caught myself in a trap 
There's barely any room to breathe
Caught in the act 
I guess that I should admit defeat
But I can't always break down in these situations

Oooh whoahohoh

And all I'm asking of you now 
Is some of your patience oooh

I just need some breathing room 
I just need to be away from you 
I just need some breathing room 
I just need to be away from you 

Oh oh ohhh

Maybe you've got a knack 
For bringing out the worst in me
Cause if you're the match 
I guess that makes me the gasoline oooh
You know it always breaks down 
To these situations oooh whoah oh
When all we have in common now 
Are these confrontations oooh

I just need some breathing room
I just need to be away from you 
I just need some breathing room 
I just need to be away from you 
I just need some breathing room 
I just need to be away from you 
I just need some breathing room 
I just need to be away from you 

Ooooh whoa whoa

Breathing 
Breathing
Breathing 
Breathing
