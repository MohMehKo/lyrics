Don't want to hear your sad songs
Heard them all before
Take it from me dear
You don't need them anymore

Sympathy is all you know
Just let it go

Let's find a way to turn this around
You're like an anchor, bringing me down
Sinking deeper, I can't reach you
I've seen right through your crying game
I say "hello," you run your mouth again
Sinking deeper, I can't reach you

How can I make you understand?
It's not who you are,
But it's exactly who you'll be
If you let it get that far

Sympathy is all you know
Just let it go

Let's find a way to turn this around
You're like an anchor, bringing me down
Sinking deeper, I can't reach you
I've seen right through your crying game
I say "hello," you run your mouth again
Sinking deeper, I can't reach you

You just take, take, take, take
Why can't you give, give, give, give
Before I'm gone?
You just take, take, take, take
Why can't you give, give, give, give
Before I'm gone?

Let's find a way to turn this around
You're like an anchor, bringing me down
Sinking deeper, I can't reach you
I've seen right through your crying game
I say "hello," you run your mouth again
Sinking deeper, I can't reach you
