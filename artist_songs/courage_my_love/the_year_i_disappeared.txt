I'm still trying to fit in to my old life before I ever laid eyes on you
I still think of you awake at night hoping I'm on your mind too

What we had may have been once in a lifetime
All I have now are memories of when you were all mine

I still feel you, see you, breathe you in
I still need you here
This could be the year I disappear

This could be the year I disappear
This could be the year I disappear

I hate falling asleep without you, dreaming of keeping you here
I hate writing these songs about you knowing you will never hear them

What we had may have been once in a lifetime
All I have now are memories of when you were all mine

I still feel you, see you, breathe you in
I still need you here
This could be the year I disappear

This could be the year I disappear
This could be the year I disappear

I have changed now
For better or for worse
I'll never be the same now
I hope you hear these words

I still feel you, see you, breathe you in
I still need you here
This could be the year I disappear

This could be the year I disappear
I still feel you
This could be the year I disappear
I still need you here
This could be the year I disappear
