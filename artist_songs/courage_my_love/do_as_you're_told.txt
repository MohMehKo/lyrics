19 unable to believe but you're willing to pretend
So unsure well you've been there before
Now you're feeling it again
You say you've been in love or at least you thought 
You didn't feel it enough or was it too much

You don't know you just do as your told [x2]
Uptight you've never been right
Held it close to your chest 
You held out but now without a doubt 
All they want is the rest

You say we are in love
Don't say that we're not 
You didn't feel it enough was it too much

You don't know you just do as your told [x4]

Every time you say forever 
Every time you lose a little more 

You don't know you just do as your told [x2]

Take your time 
When you say your all all mine
Cause you always rush 
When you fall for someone out of trust 

Take your time you don't know you don't know
When you say your mine you don't know you don't know 
Cause you always rush you don't know you don't know
When you fall for someone out of trust you don't know [x2]

You don't know you just do as your told [x4]

Every time you say forever 
Every time you lose a little more 

You don't know you just do as your told [x2]
