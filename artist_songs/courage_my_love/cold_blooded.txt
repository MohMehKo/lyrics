Slow me down, counting every step,
I remember that time, remember that place.
You're filling my mind with thoughts I can't erase.
Deeper now, holding every breath
I shut the world out, you let yourself in
A little creature here in my skin

Your eyes are always on me
I can't let you win

Take comfort, you'll find a new lover
Cold blooded, I know what you are.
Now I see you shed your skin in front of me
Cold blooded, I know what you are.

It's hard to say why I've been trying to escape
No matter how far I run away,
I always end up back in the same place,
It's getting closer and closer
You're gripping tighter and tighter.
We do this over and over and over

Your eyes are always on me
I can't let you win

Take comfort, you'll find a new lover
Cold blooded, I know what you are.
Now I see you shed your skin in front of me
Cold blooded, I know what you are.

Just let this go [x4]
Just let me go

Take comfort, you'll find a new lover
Cold blooded, I know what you are.
Now I see you shed your skin in front of me
Cold blooded, I know what you are.
