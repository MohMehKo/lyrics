I can feel you pulling down on me
Like the currents of the river
No I can't tell you where it may lead
I can only hope it carries me far

You told me not to fight,
With dreams so big, there's no use
You were almost right
My dreams are always bigger than you

I know you'll swear that you still have faith in me
You'll be surprised, when this river leads into the sea
River carry me [x3]

I throw every thought into the sea
Just to see how far they sink
Though I know they'll all come back to me
When this guilty tide holds them in

I can't believe I almost gave into the undertow
Every time I fall, I get back up cause now I know

I know you'll swear that you still have faith in me
You'll be surprised when this river leads into the sea
(carry me away)
River carry me

This promise I will keep
You won't forget me easily

River carry me [x4]

I know you'll swear that you still have faith in me
You'll be surprised where this river leads me
I know you'll swear that you still have faith in me
Your be surprised when this river leads into the sea
(carry me away)
River carry me
