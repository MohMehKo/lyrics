If you need someone
Doesn't have to mean that we should fall in love
If you need someone
I can keep a secret if it's what you want

Here we are, 4 AM
Champagne lies, say I'm just a friend
But like the sun, you came and went
In the dark alone again

I've been on the outside
Looking into your life
Reading into blurred lines
Even if it's just for tonight

If you need someone
Doesn't have to mean that we should fall in love, no
If you need someone
I can keep a secret if it's what you want, oh
Such a fool for believing, we're more than we are
But my heart skips a beat every time that you call
When you need someone
I can be someone

Made up my mind, made up my bed
You come around and mess them up again
And like a breeze, it's so effortless
The way you blow off everything

I've been on the outside
Looking into your life
Telling little white lies
Even if it's just for tonight

If you need someone
Doesn't have to mean that we should fall in love, no
If you need someone
I can keep a secret if it's what you want, oh
Such a fool for believing, we're more than we are
But my heart skips a beat every time that you call
When you need someone
I can be someone

If you need someone
Doesn't have to mean that we should fall in love
If you need someone
I can keep a secret if it's what you want
Just for tonight

If you need someone
Doesn't have to mean that we should fall in love, no
If you need someone
I can keep a secret if it's what you want, oh
Such a fool for believing, we're more than we are
But my heart skips a beat every time that you call
When you need someone, when you need someone
I can be someone, I can be someone

I can be someone
