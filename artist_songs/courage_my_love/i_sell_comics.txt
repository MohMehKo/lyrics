What manner of creature 
Stands behind this counter 
Man or machine is the big mystery 
With every transaction 
Comes a sweet satisfaction
As I cement my place in history.

It's just another sale
(Come on buy one you just can't get enough) 
To this comics-selling alpha male.

I could sell comics to a blind man 
(A Wednesday warrior through and through) 
And you'll buy every single thing I tell you to. 
'Cause I sell comics baby. 
(Come on buy one you just can't get enough) 
I sell comics baby
(Come on buy one you can't get enough) 
Oooh Yeah!

My fingers dance over 
The cash register 
Don't look so surprised
I'll leave your mouth agape 
And it's not because 
I make King Kong 
Look like just another ape.

(In WWII the allies kicked nazi ass and Hitler sobbed nein, nein, nein just like my competition when they hang that going out of business sign)

I could sell comics to a blind man.

And you'll buy every single thing I tell you to. 
I sell comics baby.
