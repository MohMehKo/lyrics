This isn't me
I'm not the type to move so recklessly
I know, I know this isn't love

I swear I feel it when you touch her
You don't mean it when you say you love her
He's a stranger, I feel better
In the morning I'll regret this

If these walls could speak
I hope they don't tell on me
All the secrets that they keep
You were everything to me
If these walls could breathe
I know they'd be whispering
"You were everything to me
You were everything to me"

This isn't me
This isn't where I thought my life would be
I'm close, so close to giving up

I swear I feel it when you touch her
You don't mean it when you say you love her
He's a stranger, I feel better
In the morning I'll regret this

If these walls could speak
I hope they don't tell on me
All the secrets that they keep
You were everything to me
If these walls could breathe
I know they'd be whispering
"You were everything to me
You were everything to me"

If these walls can breathe
Can't be alone with myself
If these walls can breathe
But I don't trust anyone else

If these walls can speak
I hope they don't tell on me
Cause I know everything they've seen

If these walls could speak
I hope they don't tell on me
All the secrets that they keep
You were everything to me
If these walls could breathe
I know they'd be whispering
"You were everything to me
You were everything to me"

"You were everything to me
You were everything to me"
