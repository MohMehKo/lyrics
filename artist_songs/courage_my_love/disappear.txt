So tense never tenser 
You could say I'm on the fence 
But who's that you're holding hands with? 
Looks like another night of? 
trying to keep my distance 
Feels like you're haunting this place 
I'm sick of seeing you everywhere I go 

I never imagined it could ever be like this 
I keep looking over my shoulder trying to resist 

You're just another stranger now 
You're just another face that's lost in the crowd 
I can't forget you, I can't forget you 
You're just another stranger now

I wish you would disappear, disappear, disappear
I wish you would disappear, disappear, disappear
I wish you would disappear, disappear, disappear
I wish you would

Awkward conversation, false smile, but I'm losing patience
I'm running out of things to say

I never imagined it could ever be like this 
I keep looking over my shoulder trying to resist 

You're just another stranger now 
You're just another face that's lost in the crowd 
I can't forget you, I can't forget you 
You're just another stranger now 

I wish you would disappear, disappear, disappear
I wish you would disappear, disappear, disappear
I wish you would disappear, disappear, disappear
I wish you would

You're a stranger now [repeat]

You're just another stranger now 
You're just another face that's lost in the crowd 
I can't forget you, I can't forget you 
You're just another stranger now 

I wish you would disappear, disappear, disappear
I wish you would disappear, disappear, disappear
I wish you would disappear, disappear, disappear
I wish you would
