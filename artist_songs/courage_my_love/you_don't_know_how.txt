Hold me, control me
(Is this what you want?)
As if you own me
(And everything I've got)

Come over slowly, sink into my skin
Everyone told me to not let this begin,begin again.

Get out if it's too much, I won't slow down.
Found out I'm strong enough on my own now.
Give up your heart to love, you don't know how.

My eyes are open, it's never been this clear.
I let you go and I watched you disappear.

Come over slowly, sink into my skin.
Everyone told me to not let this begin, begin again.

You don't know how long I've waited
Held my tongue but now I'll say this.
