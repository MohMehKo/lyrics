I wanna tear you limb from limb
Just so I can touch your skin
Feel all the places you've been

I wanna claw you to the core
So I can find your beating heart
Bare my teeth and sink them in

Can you feel my animal heart?
Can you feel my animal heart?
There's a beast inside these bones of mine
Running wild through the night
Can you feel my animal heart?
Oooh yeah

I wanna know your every move
Just so I can lick your wounds
Shed all my skin and bury you

I always knew the day would come
When we'd grow fond of tasting blood
Bare our teeth howling at the moon

Owooooo

Can you feel my animal heart?
Can you feel my animal heart?
There's a beast inside these bones of mine
Running wild through the night
Can you feel my animal heart?
Oooh yeah

Here in the dark
I'm lying awake
Asleep in my arms
I'm hunting my prey

Can you feel my animal heart?
Can you feel my animal heart?
There's a beast inside these bones of mine
Running wild through the night
Can you feel my animal heart?
Oooh yeah
