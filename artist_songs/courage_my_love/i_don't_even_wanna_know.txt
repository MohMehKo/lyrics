Maybe we just bring out 
The worst in each other
Baby we just can't stop 
Hurting one another
How far is too far to go
How much is too much to hope

I don't even wanna know 
If you're alright
I don't even wanna know 
If you're lonely tonight
I don't even wanna know
If ignorance is bliss 
Don't tell me anything more
If I'm on your mind 
I don't even wanna know

Maybe you should spit it out 
So I don't need to wonder
Drain the poison from your mouth 
Contaminate the others

How close is too close to be
How soon is too soon to leave (leave)
I don't even wanna know 
If you're alright
I don't even wanna know
If you want me tonight
I don't even wanna know 
If Ignorance is bliss 
Don't tell me anything more
If I'm on your mind 
I don't even wanna know
If ignorance is bliss 
Don't tell me anything more
I know it's selfishness 
But I can't seem too let it go
There is so much to say that 
I don't even wanna know 
If your alright 
I don't even wanna know 
If you're lonely tonight 
I don't even wanna know
If ignorance is bliss 
Don't tell me anything more 
If I'm on your mind 
I don't even wanna know
