You stole everything you got from me
My soul, my heart, and I just gave you the key
Let go of me before I start to believe
Love hurts, love hurts, love hurts

So close to the end of my rope
Swallowing so many words, I'm about to choke
It's like you're living out some twisted fantasy
Where you're the king of the world ruling over me

I stay up all night
You call, we fight
Red eyes til daylight
But we're still okay, right?
We've got our issues
God knows I do
But when it comes to you
God knows what I've been through

You stole everything you got from me
My soul, my heart, and I just gave you the key
Let go of me before I start to believe
Love hurts, love hurts, love hurts

Stone cold, like a knife to the throat
Falling on so many swords that I'm full of holes
It's like my heart's carved out, split right in two
Already lost myself and now I'm losing you

I stay up all night
You call, we fight
Red eyes til daylight
But I'm still to blame, right?
I'm still to blame, right?

You stole everything you got from me
My soul, my heart, and I just gave you the key
So let go and leave before I start to believe
Love hurts, love hurts, love hurts

Love hurts, love hurts, love hurts

You stole everything you got from me
My soul, my heart, and I just gave you the key
Let go of me before I start to believe
Love hurts, love hurts, love hurts

So close to the end of my rope
Swallowing so many words, I'm about to choke
Like you're living out some twisted fantasy
Where you're the king of the world ruling over me

You stole everything you got from me
My soul, my heart, and I just gave you the key
So let go and leave before I start to believe
Love hurts, love hurts, love hurts

Yeah, love hurts, love hurts
Yeah, love hurts, love hurts
