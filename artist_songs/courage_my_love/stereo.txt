We were kids smoking up wild fire in our lungs
Burnt the world just because we could
Dirty knees, summer dress, stolen liquor on our lips
Heels in our hands, walking home with you

Now you hate saying my name
Fading in and out of your waves
I'm a song you don't wanna play

I hope you hear this on your radio, radio
Frequency feelings that keep peaking, I'm out of control
Sending signals I just can't decode, can't decode
Got me back and forth, lost in your stereo

I always thought you and I would be like the stars at night
Permanent, never drift apart
You drew a line in the sand that divided all our plans
Never meant to let it get this far

I'm a song you don't wanna play

I hope you hear this on your radio, radio
Frequency feelings that keep peaking, I'm out of control
Sending signals I just can't decode, can't decode
Got me back and forth, lost in your stereo

Frequency feelings I get
When you play your games in my head
You got me watching my step
But I'll keep running back in the end, yeah

Fading in and out of your waves
I'm a song you don't wanna play

I hope you hear this on your radio, radio
Frequency feelings peaking out of control
Sending signals I just can't decode, can't decode
Lost in your stereo, lost in your stereo

Lost in your stereo
