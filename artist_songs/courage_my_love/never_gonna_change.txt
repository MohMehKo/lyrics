Tried to be better for you
When I should have tried for myself
Wanted to give you the moon
When all you gave me was hell
I should have opened my eyes
When you didn't see what you had
Always been chasing a prize
That meant nothing in the end
I'll never do that again

I'm never gonna, never gonna change
I'm never gonna, never gonna change
I'm never gonna, never gonna change
Even if you want me to
I'm never gonna change for you

I'm never gonna change for you
I'm never gonna change for you

Nobody's perfect I know
That's not how I see myself
But I still believe we can grow
Without needing someone else
You can't control what you don't own
And you don't own a body's soul
Don't try to fix what isn't broken
I might have let you then
I'll never do that again

I'm never gonna, never gonna change
I'm never gonna, never gonna change
I'm never gonna, never gonna change
Even if you want me to
I'm never gonna change for you

Even if you want me to
I'm better off without you
Don't tell me what to do
I'm better off without you

Tried to be better for you
When I should have tried for myself

I'm never gonna

I'm never gonna, never gonna change
I'm never gonna, never gonna change
I'm never gonna, never gonna change
Even if you want me to
I'm never gonna change for you

I'm never gonna change for you
I'm never gonna change for you
Even if you want me to
I'm never gonna change for you
