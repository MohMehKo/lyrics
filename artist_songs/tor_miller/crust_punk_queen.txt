You are into the wild
Always a wild child
The pulse of their lives is too calm and mild
No structured living
No plans to walk down the aisle
Parents wish for college
Though you'd think they're in denial

They wouldn't vote you queen of the homecoming
Though you didn't really want to be
Organized sports and much counselling
Pushed you over, sent you packing
Crust punk queen
Left mom and dad when you were 17
And tore up those jet black jeans
Hopped on a train into a troubled scene
With all the trust fund drug fiends
Who don't care about the
Don't seem to care about the American dream
Who don't care about the American dream

From my own prison I hear my stomach grumble
My father's footsteps are so far apart that I could stumble
I see who walks upon the cracks of the concrete jungle
I wish I could just fall apart so you would help me crumble

They wouldn't vote you queen of the homecoming
Though you didn't really want to be
Organized sports and much counselling
Pushed you over, sent you packing
Crust punk queen
Left mom and dad when you were 17
And tore up those jet black jeans
Hopped on a train into a troubled scene
With all the trust fund drug fiends
Who don't care about the
Don't seem to care about the American dream
Who don't care about the
Don't seem to care about the American dream
Who don't care about the American dream

Mom and dad this little hell which hangs over my head
And I know it's gonna show up once again
Mom and dad I need a little more money to get by
And I promise that this shit is gonna end
And when the fog clears look in my eyes I'll be
Coming home once again

Crust punk queen
Left mom and dad when you were 17
And tore up those jet black jeans
Hopped on a train into a troubled scene
With all the trust fund drug fiends
Who don't care about the
Don't seem to care about the American dream
Who don't care about the
Don't seem to care about the American dream
Who really cares about the American dream
