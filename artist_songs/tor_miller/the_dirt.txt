Beneath the blood moon, all filled with wine
You say you love me for the very first time
And as the three words fire from your teeth
Like some perfect bullet to knock me off my feet

I'll be loving you, too
The shadow of your heart, it cuts right through

And as you fall for some decent man
You place your life into his trembling hands
And as the red sun struggles up in the sky
With his arms around you, and your dreaming eyes

I'll be loving you, too
The shadow of your heart, it cuts right through
I'll be loving you, too
From your lips to the dirt they lower me down into

And as I make love to another woman
Your name is riding on the tip of my tongue
And as her body crashes on me like a wave
My resolve may weaken, but never break

I'll be loving you, too
The shadow of your heart, it cuts right through
I'll be loving you, too
From your lips to the dirt they lower me down into
And the shadow of your heart, it cuts right through

And when the day comes, you've forgotten my name
And I've drunk an ocean to try to quell the pain
And in your autumn, when your colours have changed
Your naked branches or your lips don't feel the same
From the greyhound to the after light
I was looking out my window all this time

I'll be loving you, too
The shadow of your heart, it cuts right through
I'll be loving you, too
From your lips to the dirt they lower me down into
