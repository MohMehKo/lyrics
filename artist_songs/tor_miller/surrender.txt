Baby I, baby I surrender
Baby I, baby I surrender
Baby I, baby I surrender
Baby I, baby I surrender

Give my records back
But keep my sweater on
It’s gonna be a cold December
Maybe we ran out of electricity
Maybe we're too young our hearts too tender
But the tail lights over the bridge are already fading

One less night with you
One less avenue
One less moment to remember
One more l-train stop
And one last look at you
And no more playing the pretender

Baby I surrender, uh
Baby baby I surrender, uh

You call at 2 am but I won’t pick up
Every sidewalk will be wider than an ocean
I'll delete your name, erase my history
It will feel just like a revolution, oh

One less night with you
One less avenue
One less moment to remember
One more l-train stop
And one last look at you
And no more playing the pretender

Baby I surrender, uh
Baby baby I surrender, uh

The tail lights over the bridge are already fading
Before my heart has one more reason from breaking

One less night with you
One less avenue
One less moment to remember
One more l-train stop
And one last look at you
And no more playing the pretender

Baby I surrender, uh
Baby baby I surrender, uh
Baby I surrender
Surrender
Surrender
