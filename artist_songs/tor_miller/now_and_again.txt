Now and again
I'll be thinkin' about you
It will cross through my head
There's nothin' I can do
And I wonder if you're going out
If you're staying home instead
Am I just being paranoid?
Or is it all in my head?

Now I'm tellin' myself I should give it up
Get off before the end of line
Am I kidding myself I will live it up
If I could only get you out of my mind

I'd make the call spill it all if I really wanted you
And you'd throw your pride to the side
If that's what you gotta do
And we could have it all
If we really wanted to
If we really wanted to

Every day I'm livin' in this déjà vu
I've got bills to pay
Punchin' in and punchin' through
I'm tired of this shit that I've gotta do
I'd rather stay home instead
Just the 9 to 5 to be with you
Then have you sleep in my bed

I'd make the call spill it all if I really wanted you
And you'd throw your pride to the side
If that's what you gotta do
And we could have it all
If we really wanted to
If we really wanted to

I can't stop
Get you outta of my head
And I am wishing there were times where I would have said
That I think about you and I want you so bad
Oh I think about you
I can't stop
Get you outta of my head
And I am wishing there were times where I would have said
That I think about you and I want you so bad
Oh I think about you

I'd make the call spill it all if I really wanted you
And you'd throw your pride to the side
If that's what you gotta do
And we could have it all
If we really wanted to
If we really wanted to
