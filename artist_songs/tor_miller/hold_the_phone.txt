From the first kiss
I always thought we would be more than this
Some call it bliss
But there's something that we've always missed

If you love me now
Speak it true and let your words ring out
Here I stand
With open arms and my heart in hand

Hold the phone
I never you knew you felt so alone
Let it be known
I never wanted to let you go
I never wanted to let you go
I never wanted to let you go
I never wanted to let you go

For every show
The curtain called and the lights went low
Fast and slow
The wind who whips the life on the road

Hold the phone
I never knew you felt so alone
Let it be known
I never wanted to let you go
I never wanted to let you go
I never wanted to let you go
I never wanted to let you go

And I was only
Trying to make it
To start a better life
A house with the yard and kids
Maybe a wife
Thought I was doing right
By making my name in the spotlight

Other fortunes seemed
More important than you and I
Our inconsequential lives
Sending its tower
Clocks the hour
So I'll try to come home tonight
And I was only
Trying to make it
