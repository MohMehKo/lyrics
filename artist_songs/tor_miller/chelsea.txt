To escape from the heat
Roll one up tight
Find a light
And take it to the street
Air conditioner is broke, I see
That the kids fixed the hydrant on
Broome and Ludlow
Water flows down to gutters below

The sun is shinning down on my face
And the pretty girls are running around
In the park oh the band starts to play

I'm looking up and walking to Chelsea
The way that we used to go
Walking to Chelsea
Getting lost in the places we know
I'm still your New York City
New York City boy
It's still as pretty
Even when you're not around
New York City
New York City boy
New York, New York
New York City boy

The sun's coming down
Over the broken beer bottles
In china town
Memories from the past
We were so close
Two in one
Lost off the grass
How the time went as fast
As the cash

The sun is shinning down on my face
And the pretty girls are running around
In the park oh the band starts to play

I'm looking up and walking to Chelsea
The way that we used to go
Walking to Chelsea
Getting lost in the places we know
I'm still your New York City
New York City boy
It's still as pretty
Even when you're not around
New York City
New York City boy
New York, New York
New York City boy

I'm walking to Chelsea
The way that we used to go
Walking to Chelsea
Getting lost in the places we know
I'm still your New York City
New York City boy
It's still as pretty
Even when you're not around
New York City
New York City boy
New York, New York
New York City boy
New York City
New York City boy
It's still as pretty
Even when you're not around
New York City
New York City boy
New York, New York
New York City boy
