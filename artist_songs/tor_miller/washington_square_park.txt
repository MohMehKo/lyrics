I first saw you on Great Jones
You was singing out loud with your headphones on
Well Lady Stardust is my favorite song
I didn't even care you got every word wrong

I can't find you in the crowd
In my head I see you over and over again
I stood outside the cinema
You set me up in flames

My heart is still stuck in Washington Square Park
Waiting in the neon baby
I just wanna know where you are
And why it feels like I'm going crazy
Now the night always seem so dark
In Washington Square Park

Above Skyscrapers and under every stone
Are you hiding somewhere in the midnight shadows
Said post no bills but I put up signs
Stood on the corner handing out flyers
No I won't stop until you're mine

My heart still stuck in Washington Square Park
Waiting in the neon baby
I just wanna know where you are
And why it feels like I'm going crazy
So this is where the vampires go
I guess it's a city I just didn't know
Now the night always seem so dark
In Washington Square Park

My heart still stuck in Washington Square Park
Waiting in the neon baby
I just wanna know where you are
And why it feels like I'm going crazy
So this is where the vampires go
I guess it's a city I just didn't know
Now the night always seem so dark
In Washington Square Park
In Washington Square Park
