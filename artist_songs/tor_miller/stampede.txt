With your hair tied back and my t-shirt on
and we're bathed in red drownin' in the yarn
Well I know how the story goes, well I know

We got love to spill, we got blood to bleed
Never gave a fuck where our lives would lead,
But I know, I'm gonna lose you in the stampede

Settle down in the thunder
Lay your soul in this bed
Gimme ghosts to remember, not to regret

With your hair tied back and my t-shirt on
And the universe rattlin' through your bones
Well I know how this story goes, well I know

In your sister's car when we stole the keys
To the reservoir at a break-neck speed
Well I know I'm gonna lose you in the stampede

Hummingbird in the jet stream
Paper boat in the sea
Stay, with me reckless
Baby stay with me

With your hair tied back and my t-shirt on
And you're painted red drownin' in the yarn
Well I know how this story goes, well I know

Wanna burst your heart, wanna watch you sleep
Nothing in this life is ever guaranteed,
But I know I'm gonna lose you in the stampede

With your hair tied back and my t-shirt on
And the universe rattlin' through your bones
Well I know how this story goes, well I know

In a concrete rush with nowhere to breathe
And it feels like we lose another mouth to feed
I know I'm gonna lose you in the stampede

With your hair tied back and my t-shirt on
And we're bathed in red drownin' in the yarn
I know I'm gonna lose you in the stampede
