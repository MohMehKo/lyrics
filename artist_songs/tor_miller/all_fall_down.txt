Every evening on my way back home
I keep myself compose pretending we'll be fine
But I believe in you wake up alone
Even know you always know that I miss you cry

I know every hour that passes by
I'm turnin' roses into ashes
I made heaven a hell and
Made it harder on myself

I go down and choose my words carefully
So I won't give it all the way, all the way
Right now, girl you see right through me
Throwing it all the way, all the way to the ground
We all fall down

And it'll be easy if I did something wrong
Is what we have wasn't so strong
If it was just a lie
But we both know that what we have is pure gold
Kinda think that you won't let go for all your life

And I wish I can stay and talk to you
Say the things I know you want me to
Run in this frustration with the [?]
I know every hour that passes by
I'm turnin' roses into ashes
I made heaven a hell and
Made it harder on myself

I go down and choose my words carefully
So I won't give it all the way, all the way
Right now, girl you see right through me
Throwing it all the way, all the way to the ground
We all fall down

I go down and choose my words carefully
So I won't give it all the way, all the way
Right now, girl you see right through me
Throwing it all the way, all the way to the ground
We all fall down
We all fall down
