Maybe I hate being alone
And holding you through a cellphone
And runin' hard from the miles
If I could break all the fast clocks
Wouldn't make all the noise stop
Could we be still for a while

I'm probably gonna let you down

Lying awake in a fever
Call me a cold sweat believer
I will be loving you always, always, always
Heart beating louder than thunder
If you are ever to wonder
I will be loving you always, always, always

I'm looking for lights on the runway
Can you forget my mistakes
And wipe the blood from my hands
Take me from the city of angels
All the stars and the fables
Show me somewhere to land

I never wanna let you down

Lying awake in a fever
Call me a cold sweat believer
I will be loving you always, always, always
Heart beating louder than thunder
If you are ever to wonder
I will be loving you always, always, always

I don't want to ever lose you
I will love you always, always, always
I don't want to ever lose you
I will love you always, always, always

Lying awake in a fever
Call me a cold sweat believer
I will be loving you always, always, always
Heart beating louder than thunder
If you are ever to wonder
I will be loving you always, always, always

I don't want to ever lose you
I will love you always, always, always

Don't know how we got to this place
But I'll be loving you always
And I always will
