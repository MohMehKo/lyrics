I left home about a week ago
I never really had a brain of my own
Back then I had an ego
Thinking that the world was so damn small

And it's like the lawn is on fire
Like the fumes might get me high

And baby blue, what should I do?
Will I feel so lost without you?
And I'm deaf, dumb, blind and out of touch
Your eyes got so big
Who can I trust?
And I feel so far from your side
And when I look up I start to cry
You're a darker hue
My baby blue

And I've re-read the same page
Never comprehending what the words have to say
I'm always on the next stage
Living for a moment that never comes my way

And it's like my number is retired
Like we always knew our lines

And baby blue, what should I do?
Will I feel so lost without you?
And I'm deaf, dumb, blind and out of touch
Your eyes got so big
Who can I trust?
And I feel so far from your side
And when I look up I start to cry
You're a darker hue

Baby blue, what should I do?
Will I feel so lost without you?
I'm deaf, dumb, blind and out of touch
Your eyes got so big
Who can I trust?
And I feel so far from your side
And when I look up I start to cry
You're a darker hue
My baby blue

You're a darker hue
My baby blue
