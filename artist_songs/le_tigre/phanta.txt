[voice continues throughout song:] speak your identification code, speak your destination, and place.

Four months and eight days
Been waiting here
Transporter broken
Horizon's clear

(DAY ONE)
No vegetation
Blips on my screen
Whatever was here
Has been disappeared

Now here's alright [x2]

(DAY TWO)
Wait tower
Radar's going off
I see a small creature
Who can barely walk

My data says "large"
But what I see is small
Text reads "Big Danger"
But this just looks tired

Now here's alright [x2]

(DAY THREE)
Come in tower
All our data's wrong
Research inconsistent
We misread azlyr it all

There was no monster
And what's left is near dead
Control killed a phantom
From inside their heads

Nowhere's alright [x4]
