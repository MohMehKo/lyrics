Backstage, everyone wants a piece of JD
Kathleen's on the phone and i got to go get paid
See, promoter's making small talk
He says we knocked his socks off
Cinna-mint, inter-net, cinnamon and butter-buns!
Who's got the keys?
Oh! look, man, we just gotta get some sleep
He says "do you guys need a place to stay?"
No, no thanks, just point at to the highway
She said, she likes it better when were angry
"Sing that song again that makes me think youre gonna spank me!"
Head on my jacket like a pillow in the van
When i close my eyes im in a cross-town cab

Hey, who wants to party?
Those girls outside just asked me
Check out's late and they seem cool, so
Oh ok, ok, ok

Hey we want a universal healthcare deal
And we want kissinger on trial for real
We got a right wing king making third world war
Assholes, oil-guys!
How many shows till were back in new york?
Killer's got us packed up, coffee in a travel mug
Thinks she got the mix all right, she says she wants to drive tonight
The power amp we call the "pamp"
The S-2000 we call it the "samp"
The MRC's do not come on tour
They used to, back when we were hardcore
Hey these girls say that this town sucks!
They just wanna know if they can come with us

Hey, who wants to party?
Those girls outside just asked me
Check out's late and they seem cool, so
Oh, ok, ok, ok...
