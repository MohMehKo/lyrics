I don't care you sing such a winner's song.
No I won't respond.
My silence screams ha.ha.
And you can call us wrong either way.
It "just so happens" to us everyday.
Oh I. I won't come undone.
And if you ever wanna adventure,
If you ever want a fashion show, I'll walk on yr block.
Cuz my art is better than yr art
And you will be better off when I'm gone...
And if you ever wanna try yr hand at forcing my suicide,
Come on fucker reach out for the sun!
Yeah yeah yeah you got the lens that wants to go through me.
You got the rebel style it don't fool me.
You're a poset-modern parasite.
And if you ever wanna try yr hand at forcing my suicide
Just know I've only begun,
And if you ever wanna try yr hand at forcing my suicide
Come on and try to kill me off.
