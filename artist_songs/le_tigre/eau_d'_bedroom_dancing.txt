I'm in the sky when I'm on the floor 
The world's a mess and yr my only cure 
There's no time for me to act mature 
The only words I know are "more, more" and "more" 

No one to criticize me then 
No one to criticize 
No one to criticize me then 
No one to criticize 

There's no fear when I'm in my room 
It's so clear and I know just what I want to do 
All day bedroom dancing 
To you I wanna say 
Yr my thing.
