No shopping, no choice
I can't stay here and listen to your voice
I'll be gone before you're home
And if you want to know where, I went to
Then baby you, can read it in my note
It says I went to be alone

Yeah babe,
I know I make about twice the money you make
But of course, I'm never called a stupid whore or a fake
And I don't structure my life
Around fear of murder, dismemberment, or rape
But I hardly see what that has to do with our relationship

Now if you want to know where I went to
Baby, you can read it in my note
It says I went to be alone
