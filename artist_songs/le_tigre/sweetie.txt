Why can't they understand
It was always more than me in a band
I came here tonight to find my friends
Didn't they put a stake right through our hearts

Hold me close in the rain
I'll play the second set and the sense walk out again
Why is it so wrong to be sure
Rip the stake out from my stylish heart

If they come to find me
I will fall into peices
If they come to find me
I'll sneak out the window

It's not right
It's not right
Its not right
Its not right

Taking it up and taking it back
Taking it up and taking it back
Taking it up and taking it back
Taking it up and taking it back
