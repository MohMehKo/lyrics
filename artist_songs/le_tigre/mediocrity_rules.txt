So you wanna hang out with me tonight? 
Well 
You're cool, but I'm right, so 
I'll set the dial to "no fights." 
And as we leave the club, 
and the sun is coming up, you ask, 
"Have I failed to entertain?" 
I say no man, it's ok. 

[Chorus:]
Cuz I already knew 
that when I'm with you 
Mediocrity rules, man. 
Mediocrity rules. 

Life is but a compromise 
and I can see it in yr eyes that 
nothing scares you like a real idea. 
But no man, it's ok, 
you didn't waste my day 

[Chorus]

Yabba dabba dabba doo, man. 
Yabba dabba dabba doo. 
Yabba dabba dabba doo, man. 
Yabba dabba dabba dude.
