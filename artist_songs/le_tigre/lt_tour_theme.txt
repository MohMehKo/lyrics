Yeah it's weird when the club is really crowded
And there's no way we can do every song that's shouted,
But we'll still try to push you towards abandon.
Yesh, every night is something we can't plan on.
Won't you dance some more?
For the ladies and the fags yeah,
We're the band with the rollerskate jams...
Yeah you know the guys with the digi cameras,
Push to the front and then they just stand there?
But then we see the girls walking to the dancefloor
And we remember why we go on tour.
Won't you dance some more?
