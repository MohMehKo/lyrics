The stars are getting in and out of automobiles 
And we keep wondering when we're gonna feel something real 
Keep waiting for a Santa that'll never come

But everything gets erased before it's even said 
And all that glitters isn't gold when inside it's dead 

All that glitters is not gold [x4]

I sat thru yr movie but I didn't see anything 
I went to yr comedy club and didn't laugh at all

I went to yr concert and there was nothing going on 

You don't say, you don't say 
You don't say anything.........
