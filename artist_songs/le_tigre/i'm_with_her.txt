One, two, one, two, one, two, three
Who do we want? We want HRC!

She doesn't bake cookies, doesn't play much golf
And the whole world is watching her persistent cough
Pass the wicked witch a glass of water
Careful not to spill it, you might melt The Donald

She's already done the math
And she's ready with a plan
And she's always got to work
Twice as hard as every man
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Trump has got to go!

I'm with her
To the top
She's with us
We won't stop

I'm with her
To the top
She's with us
We won't stop

I want a problem solver, a true rock climber
Pantsuit-wearing herstorical first-timer
I want a listener, a negotiator
A legal scholar, supreme court nominator

We can't, we can't, we can't, we can't, we can't wait
We can't, we can't, we can't, we can't, we can't wait

Trump thinks Putin is a "very strong leader"
Just like him, a fascist bottom feeder
Building a wall is his greatest vision
Bigotry colors his every decision

She's already done the math
And she's ready with a plan
And she's always got to work
Twice as hard as every man
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Trump has got to go!

I'm with her
To the top
She's with us
We won't stop

I'm with her
To the top
She's with us
We won't stop

[Background vocals:]
Abortion is healthcare, it's a human right
Policy homework 'til the morning light
NRA stands for murder and hate
Gun laws now! We can't wait!

I want a problem solver, a true rock climber
Pantsuit-wearing herstorical first-timer
I want a listener, a negotiator
A legal scholar, supreme court nominator

One, two, one, two, one, two, three
I don't want a racist in the President's seat
One, two, one, two, one, two, three
I don't want a sexist, it's 2016!
One, two, one, two, one, two, three
Who do we want? We want HRC!

I'm with her
To the top
She's with us
We won't stop

I'm with her
To the top
She's with us
We won't stop

I'm with her

She's with us
We won't stop

I'm with her, I'm with her, her her her (I'm with her)
I'm with her, I'm with her, her her her (To the top)
I'm with her!
