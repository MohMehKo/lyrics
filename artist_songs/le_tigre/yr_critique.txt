Yr critique is superficial 
but yr hatred's like the rain. 
We could agree to disagree, you know 
But I gotta catch my train 

[Chorus:]
So, go-go, go-go, go-go 
Good luck! 
So, go-go, go-go, go-go 
W.I.A!* 
[2x]

I think you're pretty smart 
But you act like such a jerk, I 
can't stand yr fake rebellion 
misdirected and anti-art 

[Chorus]
So over it (Now!) [4x]
