Nine years old and climbing out the house 
Thru a song played on piana by my neighbors Les and Ray. 
I put my head up against the wall to be closer to the music that they played. 

You were my oxygen, the thing that made me think I could escape. 
This is a thank you song for Les and ray 

You were my batteries, the thing that made em think I could escape. 
Here's a song for Les and, here's a song for Les and Ray
