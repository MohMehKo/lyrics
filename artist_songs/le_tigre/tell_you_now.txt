I’ll just tell you now
Cuz I dont think you know
The things you tried to kill
I found a way to grow
I’ll just tell you now
You may have made your mark
But I’m still here today
Knowing who you are
I’ll just tell you now

I’ll just tell you now (don’t want to dissapoint you)
Yr not the city of god (or be one to annoy)
You can’t strike me down (but it wont go away now)
From your mountain top (and heres the reasons why)
I’ll just tell you now (you took my intuition)
Yr not the city of god (my knowledge of the truth)
You can’t shoot me down (the love I had in this world)
From your mountain top (I gave it all to you)
I’ll just tell you now

I wanna tell you now

I’ll just tell you now
Cuz I dont think you know
The things you tried to kill
I found a way to grow
I’ll just tell you know (you took my intuition)
Yr not the city of god (my knowledge of the truth)
You can’t strike me down (the love I had in this world)
From your mountain top (I gave it all to you)

I wanna tell you now

Say this one packs a fight
Just crazy, out of my mind
Say sorry, yeah its all right
Just give me back what you took that night
I wanna tell you now
I wanna say it full out
I wanna get up in your face
And tear your thoughts right out
I wanna tell you, tell you now
I’m gonna tell you, tell you how
You didnt change my mind
You didnt do a thing
'Cept made me hate myself
And made me fear everything
You thought I’d run and hide
And keep it all inside
How can you see me
And think its alright?
I wanna tell you now
