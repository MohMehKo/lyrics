I like going to the dyke march
Because I like to be surrounded with women.
Marching naked ladies.
We recruit.
We recruit...
There's no one telling us where to stand or where to be.....
Resist, Shout it out.
Resist, Resist, Shout it out...
There's no one telling us where to stand or where to be,
We're just this huge strong mass of feminist fury.
Resist. Resist..... Feminist fury.
Feminist fury.
It was a lifelong dream I had as a child...
And it's actually come to pass in my adult life.
