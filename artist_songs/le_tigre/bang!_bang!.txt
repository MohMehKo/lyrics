Murder is murder 
Why're they confused? 
Another man dead 
I read it in the news 
Who gave them the fucking right 
To run around like they own the night? 

[Chorus:]
Oh bang! bang! 
Oh oh bang! bang! 
Oh oh bang! bang! 
Oh oh bang! bang! 

Wrong fucking time 
Wrong fucking place 
There is no fucking way 
this is not about race 
Who's gonna call 9-1-1 
When they can't tell a wallet 
from a mother fucking gun? 

[Chorus]

Bang bang daddy I want you dead 
Bang bang daddy get out of my head 
Bang bang daddy I want you dead 
Bring me Giuliani's head 

[Chorus]
