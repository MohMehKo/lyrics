So they say I was sometimes cruel
I dont know if I would say that too
Oh I, I don’t know about that
Everyday the sky reminds me still
Yr not here and it always will
Oh I, I don’t know about that

You

I try my best to play along
Like nothing’s over and no one’s gone
But I, I don’t know about that
I don’t know about that

If I tried harder you’d, still be here
Is it true?
Oh I, I don’t know about that
I don’t know about that
