(Forever in my life) [x4]

Past the point of disbelieving
Way above the borderline
You pushed me right into the deep end, girl
Ain't got no choice but take the dive

(Forever in my life)
Forever in my life I see you
(Forever in my life)
Forever you're in my life, I can't lose
(Forever in my life)
Forever I know where we're gonna break through
(Forever in my life)
Forever you got me, you got me locked down
Locked down, you got me Locked down

Past the part of my defenses
Way above the edge of time
You're playing right into my weakness, girl
Ain't got no choice but lose the fight

(Forever in my life)
Forever in my life I see you
(Forever in my life)
Forever you're in my life, I can't lose
(Forever in my life)
Forever I know where we're gonna break through
(Forever in my life)
Forever you got me, you got me locked down
Locked down, you got me Locked down

I can't deny it's early for these feelings
Can't explain what will begin
But I've learned some things happen for a reason
So I walked into you knowing that...

(Forever in my life)
Forever in my life I see you
(Forever in my life)
Forever you're in my life, I can't lose
(Forever in my life)
Forever I know where we're gonna break through
(Forever in my life)
Forever you got me, you got me locked down
Locked down, you got me Locked down
