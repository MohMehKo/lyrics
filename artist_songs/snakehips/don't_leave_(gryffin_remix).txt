Love you better than me

You know me
Now and then, I'm a mess
Please don't hold that against me
I'm a girl with a temper and heat
I know I can be crazy

But I'm not just a fuck up, I'm the fuck up you need
I don't hear nobody when you focus on me
Perfectly imperfect, yeah, I hope that you see
Tell me you see

Don't leave
Shut your mind off and let your heart breathe
You don't need to be worried
I may not ever get my shit together
But ain't nobody gonna love you better

Don't go
What we have here is irreplaceable
No, I won't trade this for nothing
I may not ever get my shit together
But ain't nobody gonna love you better than me

Love you better than me
Love you better than me
Love you better than me
Love you better than me
Love you better than me
Love you better than me
Love you better than me
Love you better than me

In a room full of people with you
I don't see anybody else, no
When we fight, and you're right
So sorry, I make it just so difficult

But I'm not just a fuck-up, I'm the fuck-up you love
We ain't like nobody else, tell me so what
Perfectly imperfect, yeah, baby, that's us
Baby, that's us
'Cause I know that you've been thinking 'bout it

Don't leave
Shut your mind off and let your heart breathe
You don't need to be worried
I may not ever get my shit together
But ain't nobody gonna love you better

Don't go
What we have here is irreplaceable
No, I won't trade this for nothing
I may not ever get my shit together
But ain't nobody gonna love you better
But ain't nobody gonna love you better
But ain't nobody gonna love you better than me

Love you better than me
Love you better than me
Love you better than me
Love you better than me
Love you better than me
Love you better than me
Love you better than me
Love you better than me
