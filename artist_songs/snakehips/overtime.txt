Ahh, I'm going overtime
Ahh, all because you're not mine

I'm running, running
Running back to you
I'm working, working
Got something to prove

Ahh, I'm doing overtime
Ahh, all because you're not mine

Running back to you
I'm working, working
Got something to prove

Running, running
Running back to you
I'm working, working
Got something to prove

Ahh, I'm doing overtime
Ahh, all because you're not mine

Running, running
Running back to you
I'm working, working
Got something to prove

Ahh, I'm doing overtime
Ahh, all because you're not mine
