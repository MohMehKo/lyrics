[Elhae:]
Yeah
She said she rather be high
So it's up, up and away we go
To somewhere that they don't know
You know feelings slow me down
And it ain't right, but it's right now
You know feelings slow me down
And it ain't right

Party everyday, why we waitin' on the weekend?
'Cause she know that I know what she came here to do
We'll be diving off the deep end, woah
'Cause I be in my zone, ooh
Pressin' up like defense, woo
And now we on the road, everythin' is slow-mo
No discussions, skip the pretense (let's not make it complicated)

[Elhae & H.E.R.:]
You know when we get together we probably won't act right
You been talkin' shit forever, but tonight's the last time
Bottle on the table, like the one we finished last night
Hold up on the breaks and hit the gas

[Elhae:]

It ain't right, but it's right now
We ain't right, we ain't right, oh
You know feelings slow me down
And it ain't right, but it's right

[D.R.A.M.:]
Girl you always fallin' off on me, that's target practice
And I can't stand it when you mad, but it look so attractive
And I got somethin' in my pocket that makes both of us happy
And when we kick it for some hours off that dope and candy
Said we be freakin' for some minutes, but it feels like hours
Said we would be strapped off that OG, but it smells like towel
And I can't stand you when I'm sober, would you still come over?
You drive me crazy, you're my chauffeur 'til the Uber shows up

[Elhae:]
She wanna get faded, so we gon' let the night [?]
And we're gonna let the [?] slow
We gon' let the party till we are, ooh

Snakehips
One bottle, two people and no chasers
Me and lil' mama, solve our problems
By gettin' wasted off the alcoholla, marijuana and etcetera
My boo thang, always and forever, yeah
We problematic, so it has it
But who ain't got problems?
We all have 'em, yeah
But she still a baddie, I'm still her daddy
And we're higher, than all y'all
Still at it, still at it
