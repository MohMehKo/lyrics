[Sinead Harnett:]
Oh no, the pennies dropped
How did my focus stop?
I never let desire lead me blind
I can’t get enough
Oh no, the force is strong
You know ya done me wrong
I never let a feeling lead my mind

I gotta rise above
Don’t need to fret
Cause if I was to take you home
What’s left when the danger’s gone?
I never let a feeling lead my mind

Would you like to know, me better, baby?
Then what you could show me, is better, maybe?
Well, I sure don’t wanna waste your time
Sure don’t wanna waste your time
So let me tell ya that I’d be, better off without you

Duck down, the bullets gone
Slow motion, switch me on
I never let desire lead me blind
Won’t give it up
Freeze frame, I dodged that shot
The bigger picture’s not good enough
I never let a feeling lead my mind
I gotta rise above

I gotta rise above
Don’t need to fret
Cause if I was to take you home
What’s left when the danger’s gone?
I never let a feeling lead my mind

Would you like to know, me better, baby?
Then what you could show me, is better, maybe?
Well, I sure don’t wanna waste your time
Sure don’t wanna waste your time
So let me tell ya that I’d be, better off without you

There I said I’m better off without you [x4]

Would you like to know, me better, baby?
Then what you could show me, is better, maybe?
Well, I sure don’t wanna waste your time
Sure don’t wanna waste your time
So let me tell ya that I’d be, better off without you
