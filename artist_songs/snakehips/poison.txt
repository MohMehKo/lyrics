Elevate my feeling
So, I don't think I'm coming down
Ain't no escaping
Elegant emotion
I'm a diamond in your eyes
Don't be mistaken
Why don't you tell me in the moment,
unless you want to fool yourself
Cuz you
Know better than to hold back,
Why you want to play yourself

I'm your poison
And you can't leave me alone
(You know I won't let go)
(I know you won't let go)
Now you're poison
Throwing stones in my window
(I know you won't let go)
You know I won't let you get away

I could be forgiven
Forgiving you the run around
It is no good pretending
Would you bless your ending
Cuz you can't say it outloud
It don't make it out your mouth
Why don't you tell me in the moment,
unless you want to fool yourself

I'm your poison
And you can't leave me alone
(You know I won't let go)
I know you won't let go
Now you're poison
Throwing stones in my window
(I know you won't let go)
You know I won't let you get away

You know I won't let you get away
You know I won't let you get away
You know I won't let you get away
You know I won't let you get away
You know, I won't let you go
You know, I won't let you get away
Nooo
You know, I won't let you go
You know, I won't let you get away
