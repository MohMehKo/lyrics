Soul sister with beautiful black eyes
Ntwana yam she kills me every time when she smiles
Educated black sister with a conscious mind
Even though I say so myself she's my type
Ethwel'iqhiya pretty much like umam'uS'biya
Using nothing but u buhle bakhe ebendibiza
Samza ngashiva lomntwana uyang'bandisa
Profound sister ben'geke ngiye daar ndiza
Mara akusizi ukulinda ngasukuma ngayozazisa
Igama uNtsika ngathi elakhe mfana uSiza

Ya blender daideng uyayizwa iya rhymer daideng
Sa chiller e cafe kanti ungwana uhamba that day

Now would it make you smile seeing her again
Seems like she's gone and she'll never return
Would it make you smile seeing her again
You act like this girl's the only reason you win

Would it make you smile
Making her your bride she's gone now that's why you singing this song
Would it make you smile
You look so sad man she left you bad

Now would it make you smile seeing her again
Seems like she's gone and she'll never return
Would it make you smile seeing her again
You act like this girl's the only reason you win

Would it make you smile
Making her your bride she's gone now that's why
You singing this song
Would it make you smile
You look so bad man she left you bad

On a day it was a Sunday
U buhle bakhe took my breath away
Ingxakuthi ebehamba that day
But I hope to see her someday
Please believe me when I say
In this sour life you're my honey
You're the only one abekho abanye
Sthandwa sami ngicela sibambisane sihlalisane

Ngumvulo ulwesibini nolwesithathu
Hayi alukho usuku olufana nolasuku
Mde unomkhitha wayevel'eMtata
Lomfana ndamphiwa Nguye uSomandla
Efak'ipanama yakhe yama krwala emnyama
Ndaziva ukuthi hayi lomfana uyandi charmer
Ndaxelela umama
UMama waxelela utata
And soon sizaw'shata nalo mfana obendi charmer
Akhange ndilinde mandi khawuleze ndizazise
Igama nguBuhle wathi umfana elakhe uSihle
Ya blender le way
Uyazivela nawe iya rhymer le way
Sa chiller elwandle
Kodwa bendigoduka that day

Molo sthandwa sam kunjani lovey wam
Ndikunika uthando lwam luthathe please
Molo sthandwa sam kunjani lovey wam

Although bathi ng'bloma ekasi lama psycho
Mara ubani othe alukho uthando eSoweto

Lommtwana lo uvela pha kwaMakhumalo and yena ingathi yeah ungoyama
