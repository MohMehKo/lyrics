[Verse:]
I Was Thinking Of You
I Was Thinking Of You
And What I Wanna Do
With You
With You
I Don't Know What To Do
I'm Going Crazy Ba-by
Without You
Without You

[Chorus:]
Lonely Nights
Can't Describe
The Feeling of Sleeping
By Myself... [x2]

[Hook:]
Lonely Nights
Lonely Nights
Lonely Nights
Lonely Nights

[Music Break]

Would You Be My Honey Baby
Would You Be My Honey Baby
Would You Be My Honey Baby
Would You Be My Honey Baby [x2]

Would You Be My Honey Baby
Without you in my life I'd go crazy
Would You Be My Honey Baby
Ngaphandle kwakho uyazi soze ndiphile [x2]
