Please now [x7]
"I really don't want us to carry on,
New years resolution", she said
It's not you, it's me. I don't want you to feel bad
I don't know why but I quickly remembered the little times we shared
I know this song sounds sad, but it's a reflection of how much I am glad.

So please listen to the words I'm about to say,
I'll be thinking of you each and everyday [x2]

At night when she called me,
She did not waste time, she just told me, she told me
She said and I quote "Ntsika you and I could never be"
Well I don't Disagree, as I'm setting you free
'Cause nami I could see that we were never ment to be
But I will miss your lips especially when I go all the way to your Hips.

So please listen to the words I'm about to say
I'll be thinking of you each and everyday [x2]

I really don't want us [x4]
To carry on
I really don't want us [x3]
To carry on
You really don't want us [x3]
To carry on
You really don't want us [x3]
To carry on
You really don't want us [x3]
I don't know why, Lord knows I don't why but it's not hard to let you go
I want to cry but then I cannot cry cause it's not hard to let you go.
It must be that soup of your love that we shared
Cause it's not hard to let you go
I want to cry but then I cannot cry cause it's not hard to let you go
Engithi go oh oh oh oh [x7]
