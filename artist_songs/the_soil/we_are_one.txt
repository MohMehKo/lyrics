Celebrate...
Celebrate humanity
And when you love
Love unconditionally
Better world begins with a smile
Go out there and give it a try
Celebrate humanity
And when you love
Love unconditionally
Better world begins with a smile
Go out there and give it a try
I pray that
As soon as you hear this song
You feel the wave of love
And that you’ll reach out
And spread love like a soaring dove
That pure love that comes from above
Without peace, love and happiness we won’t survive
May the dear Lord continue to bless you (Jesus Christ)
And those around you
Know that he loves, yeah
That’s why we say...say, say, say
We’ll never be apart
If we find it in our hearts to

Celebrate humanity
And when you love
Love unconditionally
A better world begins with a smile
Go out there and give it a try
Peace.. love.. happiness...
Is what we need
Peace.. love.. happiness
Is what we need
Calling all the nations (nations)
And everyone from different races
Stand up and make some changes (changes)
For a better human nation
Calling all the nations (nations)
And everyone from different races
Stand up and make some changes (changes)
For a better human nation
Hmmmmm, Show compassion lend a hand
It might not be easy but I know you can
Divided we fall but together we all stand
Love thy neighbour treat them like your brother
Phila nawe ngobi xesha li futshane
Ncuma nawe ngobuyazi wena umhle
Masibambaneni sincedaneni
Masithandane...ni
Because...We are one
Because...We are one
We are one
We are one (Because)
We are one (Because)
We are one
