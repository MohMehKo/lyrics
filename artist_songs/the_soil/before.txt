First things first
And this how it goes
I gotta be ready by the time that you show
Come back home, before my heart blows
The more I think about it anticipation grows,
At night when we kiss,
I like it when we slow down and we pause for a round of applause
You're gift from heaven
Forget Santa Clause
The more I think about it
Anticipation grows... before

Before you talk
Before you walk
Before you blink
Before you think
Even before you take off your coat
Allow me to come closer so please
Before I rub your feet
Before you sit
Before we rush
Before you blush
Even before you close the door
Can we have our magical kiss

It's what I look forward to when I come home to you
And your eyes light up the room when you look at me
So, baby it's ok
We can go all the way
Just promise me you'll stay
Stay with me and don't you go away

Baby it's ok
We can go all the way
Just promise me you'll stay
Stay with me and don't you go way
But before...
Before you talk
Before you walk
Before you blink
Before you think
Even before you take off your coat
Allow me to come close so please
Before I rub your feet
Before you sit
Before we rush
Before you blush
Even before you close the door
Can we have our magical kiss

Remember those days when you used to say
You love me so much and you would stay
I believed you in my heart
Cause you my baby
You one of a kind
I can say
When I think about you everyday
I feel like I'm in heaven yet again
You bring out all the love I ever had
You the one I've been waiting for
Before you talk
Before you walk
Before you blink
Before you think
Even before you take off your coat
Allow me to come close so please
Before I rub your feet
Before you sit
Before we rush
Before you blush
Even before you close the door
Can we have our magical kiss
Kiss... kiss... Kiss...
Magical kiss... kiss...
