I've been watching girl from a distance, from a distance and I've been wondering girl, if I could have your number but with my stuttering ggg...irl I'm afraid I might blow my chances so I chill and relax, relax and chill

I don't know about love at first sight but how do I explain what happened
that night we stood at a corner that had no street lights
her angelic eyes were so bright next thing we were talking and laughing tightly holding and hugging,
lip-locking and touching later in the week we were pushing and shoving is it flirting or loving,
let me tell you something, I think we fell in love
They fell in love too fast...
