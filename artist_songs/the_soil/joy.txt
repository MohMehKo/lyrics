1, 2, 3, 4!

First verse and you know it does not get any worse
I got my friends and my pals singing this to nurse
They wish our voices bring you peace on this earth
'Cause in the name of Jesus Christ we were blessed at birth
With the gift of singing your sorrows away
We won't sing 'til we drive your sorrows away
Please don't cry, winds of change are blowing away
And I know I don't know who you are but I know

We are family
(I know it, I know it, I know it)
We are family
(I got my mother, my brother, my sister and lover)
We are family
(I know it, I know it, I know it)
We are family
(I said I know it)
We are family
We are family
We are family
(I know it, I know it, I know it)
We are family

You're probably sitting there on your own
You're probably listening to this song
Pumping all over your radio
And suddenly you feel a lot of joy, joy
You're singing along,
The Soil comes in, you don't care, you just carry on

You're probably sitting there on your own
You're probably listening to this song
Pumping all over your radio
And suddenly you feel a lot of joy...
Oh oh oh oh oh

I got joy in my heart
And you know it's the kind of feeling
Followed by a sense of healing, yeah
I got joy in my heart, I got love in my heart and I got joy in my heart
And you know it's the kind of feeling
Followed by a sense of healing, yeah
I got joy in my heart, got love in my heart, I got joy in my heart

UThixo wakudala wena wandizala
Nobuhle bendalo wandithiya
Ndiyabulela mampinga
Wen' usisthandwa sam'
Akhukhw' endimthandayo njengawe
Mama wam' ndiyabulela mampinga
Usisthandwa sam'
I'm saying this because:

We are family
(I know it, I know it, I know it)
We are family
(I got my mother, my brother, my sister and lover)
We are family
(I know it, I know it, I know it)
We are family
(I said I know it)
We are family
We are family
We are family
We are family
Family in my heart
