Walking down the road,
Down the road of Soweto.

Walking down the road,
Down the road of Soweto.

Walking down the road,

Walking down the road,
Down the road of Soweto.

I met a lady in black,
Everything stop for a sec

I could not speak I was blank,
Allow me to walk you as we chat
Maybe grab a snack,
later scratch you back
Naughty Lady in black

Naughty Lady in black

I met a lady in black,
She was wearing all black

She look as if she was sad,
But, no wait she was glad.

I ran to her and never back
Holding hands as we chat

She looked at me and she said:
my, my, my (and she said) "I love you my man in black" (my man in black)

Walking down the road,
Down the road of Soweto.

Excuse me my baby
I can see all from heaven
And I kinda knew I'd meet you here around seven

I'd like to know you better,
Cook dinner for you later.

Pin up the midnight oil,
While listening to the The Soil.

My shoo be do be,
Can we be what we should be.

My shoo be do be,
Lovers that's what we should be.

My shoo be do be,
After the dinner could we pillow fight
Turn off the light,
And hold each other tight

Walking down the road,
Down the road of Soweto.

Walking down the road,
Down the road of Soweto.

Everything stop for a sec
