I took a picture, your form was cloudy in the night
You wrote a letter, you said you try to shed some light
On the good and the wicked things we do.

Face my direction, I wanna see you better, dear.
You're a distraction from everything that I feel
And the good and the wicked things I do.

Sometimes, oh, sometimes,
I think I can fade away.
In the light, oh, the light
Of an ever sunny day.
But I'm stronger than the picture that you took before you left
In the light, it faded to white.
In the light, the colors turn to white.

Indian summer, I caught a glimpse of things to come
Racing to finish, I never think before I run
To the good and the wicked things you do.

Sometimes, oh, sometimes,
I think I can fade away.
In the light, oh, the light
Of an ever sunny day.
But I'm stronger than the picture that you took before you left
In the light, it faded to white.
In the light, the colors turn to white.
In light it faded to white.
In the light the colors turn to white.
In light it faded to white.
In the light the colors turn to white.
In light it faded to white.
