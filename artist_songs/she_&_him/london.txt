Oh, London
Where the clouds never go away
I keep my coat on from September to May
When the tulips will bloom in the most unusual way

Oh, London
I love you
Where the clouds never go away

Oh, London
Where it's gloomy in the fall
I can't shake the sadness
Cause it's never that small
But we're all sad together
So I'm not alone at all

Oh, London
I'll leave you
With the sky 
Will always fall

Oh, London
Where the daffodils grow
Each one like a fireball at the end of the meadow
And I'll always forget there 
I could've felt so low
Oh, London
I'll forget you so I'll never have to go
