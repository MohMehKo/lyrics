Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
It's the time of the year
When all good dreams come true

I look at all the toys under the Christmas tree
It makes me think about the way things could be
If people all over the world could just see them too

Every Christmas, every Christmas
There's a magic in the air when the holiday spirits true

I listen to the voices as they floats my way
It must be the music that the angels play
If people all over the world could just hear it too

If we open our hearts, our wishes would come true
They'd come true

I listen to the voices as they floats my way
It must be the music that the angels play
If people all over the world could just hear it too

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
It's the time of the year
When all good dreams come true

I look at all the toys under the Christmas tree
It makes me think about the way things could be
If people all over the world could just see them too

If people all over the world could just see them too
people all over the world could just see them too
