Hair got caught in the sunlight, darling
But I just wasted the day
I knew it would happen this way
Can't get up in the morning lately
And I'm just stuck in a dream
I'm always in this ship in the stream
I'm not wasting away and you don't want me anymore
You're free to do what you want, I know
But I can't be on the clock
I won't be waiting on the dock
