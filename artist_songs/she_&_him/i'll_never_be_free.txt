Each time I hold somebody new
My arms go cold aching for you
No one can take your place
Darlin' in my embrace
I'll never be free

And when my lips burn with desire
No other kiss can put out the fire
Thought I may try and try
No one can satisfy
This longing in me

I'll never be free from your smile so tender
Sweet surrender in your eyes
How can I be free when I still remember
How you could thrill me with a sigh

Just like a chain bound to my heart
Your love remains when we're apart
Each kiss I give to you
Made me a slave to you
I'll never be free

When my lips burn with desire
No other kiss can put out the fire
Thought I may try and try
No one can satisfy
This longing in me

I'll never be free from your smile so tender
Sweet surrender in your eyes
How can I be free when I still remember
How you could thrill me with a sigh

Just like a chain bound to my heart
Your love remains when we're apart
Each kiss I give to you
Made me a slave to you
I'll never be free
