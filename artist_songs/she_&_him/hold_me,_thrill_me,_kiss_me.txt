Hold me, hold me, never let me go
Until you've told me, told me what I want to know
And then just hold me, hold me,
Make me tell you I'm in love with you

Thrill me, thrill me, walk me down the lane where shadows will be, will be
Hiding others just the same as we'll be, we'll be
When you make me tell you I love you

They told me be sensible with your new love
Don't be fooled, thinking this is the last you'll find
But they never stood in the dark with you, love
When you take me in your arms and drive me slowly out of my mind

Kiss me, kiss me, and when you do I know that you will
Miss me, miss me if we ever say "adieu"
So kiss me, kiss me, make me tell you I'm in love with you

They told me be sensible with your new love
Don't be fooled, thinking this is the last you'll find
But they never stood in the dark with you, love
When you take me in your arms and drive me slowly out of my mind

Kiss me, kiss me, and when you do I know that you will
Miss me, miss me, if we ever say "adieu"
So kiss me, kiss me, make me tell you I'm in love with you
Make me tell you I'm in love with you
