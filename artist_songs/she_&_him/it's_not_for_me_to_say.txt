It's not for me to say you love me
It's not for me to say you'll always care
Oh, but here for the moment, I can hold you fast
And press your lips to mine
And dream that love will last

And speaking just for me, it's ours to share
Perhaps the glow of love will grow with ev'ry passing day
Or we may never meet again
But then, it's not for me to say

Perhaps the glow of love will grow with ev'ry passing day
Or we may never meet again
