Did you say I've got a lot to learn
Well don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Teach me tonight

Starting with the ABC of it
Right down to the XYZ of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight

The sky's a black ball high above you
And if a shooting stars goes by
I'll use the star to write 'I love you'
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear my love
Should the teacher stand so near my love
Graduation's almost here my love
Teach me tonight

Starting with the ABC of it
Right down to the XYZ of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight

The sky's a black ball high above you
And if a shooting stars goes by
I'll use that star to write 'I love you'
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear my love
Should the teacher stand so near my love
Graduation's almost here my love
Teach me tonight
