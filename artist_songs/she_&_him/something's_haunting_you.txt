You seem to be having fun,
Raising your glass to no one, no one
What's a girl to do when something's haunting you again?
When something's haunting you.

You always love a race,
Placing your bets on no one, no one
What am I to do when something's haunting you again?
When something's haunting you.

Your love is a blessed curse,
Actually that gets worse, supernaturally.

The steps on the hall just hopped,
Seem to be going nowhere, nowhere,
What's a girl to do when something's haunting you again?
When something's haunting you again
When something's haunting you again
When something's haunting you.
