Well, I would rather do a lot of despicable things
Then sit around and wait, sit around and wait for the telephone to ring.
Why do you wait, what are you waiting for?
Stop looking out the window, looking out the window,
He came at your front door.

I'm so cold,
But I'm nice beneath the ice.
So deep, never doing as I'm told.
And it's cold outside,
But I think you'll get used to it, darling.
And it's dark out there,
But isn't scary.
I'm the cold, I'm the snow,
Make it hurt until you go.
I'm the dark, I'm the night,
I'm a bark, but never bite,
I'm the snow queen,
I'm the snow queen,
I'm the snow queen,
I'm the snow queen.
