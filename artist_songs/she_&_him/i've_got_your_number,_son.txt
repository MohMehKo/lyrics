What's a man without all the attention?
Well, he's just a man.
Why do you fear that no one will hear what you've got to say?

Who am I without all your affection?
I'm a nobody, too.
I'm not above, being unloved if that's how I've got to pay.

And you can tell everyone, everyone
I've got your number, son.
'Cause I can try my love, I can try my love onto.
'Cause I can shine my light on, I can shine my light on you.

I don't wanna spend night after night with you,
While you figure it out.
You're getting restless, I'm getting restless looking at you.

I don't wanna be rocking hard times
'Cause I figured you out.
You're not a man who can understand anyone but you.

And you can tell everyone, everyone
I've got your number, son.
'Cause I can try my love, I can try my love onto.
'Cause I can shine my light on, I can shine my light on you.

Would I sacrifice myself
At the altar of someone else's love for me?
No, that doesn't comfort me.

You think you can creep in the shadows
While you figure it out.
I've listened to enough of all your stuff to fill a book or two.

And you can tell everyone, everyone
I've got your number, son.
'Cause I can shine my light on, I can shine my light on too.
'Cause I can shine my light on, I can shine my light on you.
'Cause I can shine my light on, I can shine my light on you.
