You and I, we built a shadow of love
You and I, we built a shadow of love
In our hearts, where the future should be
There's no tomorrow to set me free.

You and I, we told a story of love
You and I, we told a story of love
From our hearts, but it never came true,
There's no tomorrow for me and you.

We weren't so young, we should've known
Love's as brittle as a broken bone.
We couldn't see around the bend
We spun the yarn without an end, without an end.

Time goes by, it's only shades of grey
Time goes by, it's only shades of grey
In my heart, where the colours should be
There's no tomorrow to set us free.
