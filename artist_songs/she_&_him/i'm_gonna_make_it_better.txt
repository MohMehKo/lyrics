Looking for a letter
Trace it in the sand
Nothing was lost on the way
I couldn't stay, holding your hand
Hours on the sidewalk
Staring at the sun
Everyone is wasting away, wasting the day, jumping the gun
I know it all comes full circle
It all comes crashing down on you
I'm gonna make it, make it better
I'm gonna get the best and lock it up and swallow the key

Hide it in your heart, chase it till the morning
Sunlight is lost in your eyes
You never tried facing the sting
Walking all in circles, take it all in stride
Faces are not what they seem, I always dream, lost in the tide

Hide it in your heart, chase it till the morning

Walking all in circles, take it all in stride
Faces are not what they seem, I always dream, lost in the tide
