If you can't sleep, I'll be there in your dreams
I'll be there in your dreams
If you can't sleep at all
And in your dreams, I'll touch your cheek
And lay my head on your shoulder

Goodbye, shadows
Goodbye, shadows

If you're far away, if you can't see my face
If the world is cold, but the sun shines the same
Shut your eyes, there are bluer skies
For you're embraced in my heart

Goodbye, shadows
Goodbye, shadows
