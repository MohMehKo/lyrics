My little baby
Oh, little baby

Baby, I know I told you
A million and more times that I, I love you so
Baby, I want to be sure
You know that I need you and I, I'll never let you go

Oh, little baby
My little baby

Baby, if you should want me
I'll come when you call me
Yes, I'll be around
Baby, don't ever worry
As long as you need me you know I'll never let you down

I wanna be with you till the day I die
You always see me through, that's the reason why, why

Baby, I wanna hold you
So close to my heart that you, you can hear me say
Baby, tell me you love me
And make me a promise that you, you'll never go away

Oh, little baby
My little baby
Oh, little baby
Oh, little baby
Oh, little baby
