I won't hold it against you,
Never hold it against you someone else's heart.
And I am not holding back now,
Just give you some slack now,
And I'll become around.

And I like you, but you think too much,
And I don't wanna be your mother
And you could just lay down
And just lay down.

And we'll all go through it together
But we all go at it alone
Yes, we all go through it together
And we all go at it alone.

And I, I don't wanna offence you,
I know that I sense you
Of someone else's heart.

And I have a slimmer of love now
I won't push and shove now,
I hope you'll come around.

And I like you, but you think too much,
And I don't wanna be your mother
And you could just lay down
And just lay down.

And we'll all go through it together
But we all go at it alone
Yes, we all go through it together
And we all go at it alone.

And we'll all go through it together
But we all go at it alone
Yes, we all go through it together
And we all go at it alone.
