Mmm, would you like to take a walk?
Mmm, wouldn't it be nice?
Mmm, how about a sarsaparilla?
Gee, the moon looks yellow
Something good will come from that

Mmm, have you heard the latest song?
Mmm, it's a very pretty strain
Mmm, are you getting kinda thrilly?
Look, it's getting chilly
But something good will come from that

When you're strolling through the wheresis
You need a whosis to lean upon
But if you got no whosis
To hug and whatsis, gosh darn oh

Mmm, would you like to take a walk?
Mmm, do you think it's gonna rain? (Oh I don't know)
Mmm, ain't you sick of television?
I wish that I was fishin'
but something good will come from that
Something good will come from that
