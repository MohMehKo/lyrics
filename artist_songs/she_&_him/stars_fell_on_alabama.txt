We lived our little drama
We kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama
Last night

I can't forget the glamour
Your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama 
Last night

I can recall in my imagination
A situation - so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center - just you and me

My heart beat like a hammer
Your arms wound around me tight
And stars fell on Alabama
Yeah, and stars fell on Alabama
And stars fell on Alabama
Last night
