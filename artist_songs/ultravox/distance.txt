You make to much of the way I am
Like my heads in another land
Break my back on a second chance
Saying I don't wanna make it last

Won't distance you
Don't resistance too
The track I distant you

My getting hungry doesn't need to end
Thinking I do something underhand
Another life couldn't live without
Will I ever keep you satisfied

Won't distance you
Don't want resistance too
The track I distant you

Destroy....distance.. Destroys...
All this...connected to me...
me.....
me!.....
me!!.....

Won't distance you
Don't want resistance too
The track I distant you

You make to much of the way I am
Like my heads in another land
Too much talking about the past
Now you seem to understand...
