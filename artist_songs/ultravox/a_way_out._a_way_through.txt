Perfecting what's mine
From now and all time
Devoted to everyone

This could not survive
It's hard to see how
This page is left unturned

[Chorus:]
I.. choose.. everything.. I feel
I.. run.. anywhere.. to see where a way
A way out, a way through

The river of fear
Runs certainly clear
Over the darkest day

Can I explain?
Time after time
The pages we burn

[Chorus]

A way out, a way..

I.. choose.. everything.. I feel
I.. run.. anywhere.. to see..

[Chorus]

A way out, a way..
A way out, a way through
A way out, a way..
