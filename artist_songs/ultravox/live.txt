Oh
Oh
Oh-oo

Time will find a way
A way to make your world go round
Present an empty day
A canvas for your words
To paint the things you see
A chapter still to come
Don't you know that every picture holds a story?

Don't you know you'll learn to live again?
Soon to find your road to everything
Don't you know you'll learn to live again?

Oh
Oh
Oh-oo

I've seen it all before
The emptiness and empty heart
Bewildered and unsure
One moment, and it's gone
Release and set you free
To cast away your ties
To radiate and shine to light your path to glory

Don't you know you'll learn to live again?
Soon to find your road to everything
Don't you know you'll learn to live again?

Time will find a way
I've seen it all before

Don't you know you'll learn to live again?
Soon to find your road to everything
Don't you know you'll learn to live again?

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
