One more day in a vacuum drags me down
One bright thought in a black room drags me down, down, down
One more head hits a wall and it drags me down
Two of us tired of it all and it drags me down

Picture us on a snow white charger
Picture us in a secret hideaway
Picture us with a million dollars
Moon madness again

One more life at a dead stop drags me down
Like a cat in a cage in a big top drags me down, down, down
Like strangers who nod on a station drag me down
Run dry on our conversations, drags me down

Picture us on a wild adventure
Picture us as we sail around the world
Picture us with some happy moments
Moon madness again

One more day in a vacuum drags me down
One bright thought in a black room drags me down, down, down
One more head hits a wall and it drags me down
Two of us tired of it all and it drags me down, down, down
One more life at a dead stop drags me down
Like a cat in a cage in a big top drags me down, down, down
Strangers who nod on a station drag me down...
