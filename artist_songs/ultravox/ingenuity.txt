Reach for the stars 
(Kudos is lost) 
The space race 
Man on the moon 
(Won't tear me apart) 
Your future 

Curiosity staring out 
In everyone's eyes 
Discover lust? 
We're innocent now 
Deliver us 
Ingenuity right now 

Ingenuity right now 
Ingenuity 

Send out the sound 
(Galactic collide) 
Lightyears 
A quest for the key 
(The technology) 
To transport us 

Curiosity steers us out 
Through everyone's eyes 
Discover lust 
We're innocent now 
Deliver us 
Ingenuity right now 

Discover us 
They're amateurs now 
Deliver us 
Ingenuity right now 

Ingenuity right now [x3]

Discover us 
We're innocent now 
Deliver us 
Ingenuity right now 

Discover us 
They're amateurs now 
Deliver us 
Ingenuity right now
