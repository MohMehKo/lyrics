There's nothing left
The system's gone
It's taking over, over, over
Right before our eyes

It's all over
Hear them cry
It's all over
Hear them sigh
It's all over
Nothing but time, time, time is all we had

Face to face
Room to room
It's taking over

The streets are bare
There's nothing there
It's all gone now, gone now, gone now
Right before our eyes

It's all over
Hear them cry
It's all over
See them die
It's all over
Nothing but time, time, time is all I had

Face to face
Room to room
It's taking over

It's all over
Hear them cry
It's all over
Hear them die
It's all over
Nothing but time, time, time is all we had

Face to face
Room to room
We're taking over, oh!
