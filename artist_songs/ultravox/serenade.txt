Serenade
In rhythm and swing, serenade
The gift that we bring, serenade
Youth runs wild with the beat in their hearts
Dance a wild dance, be torn apart

Voices ringing in their heads
Their crashing hands in time
In sequence and in rhyme
The chant of a thousand-fold
The song of a million strong
Echoes their perfect praise

Serenade
In rhythm and swing, serenade
The gift that we bring, serenade
Youth runs wild with the beat in their hearts
Dance a wild dance, be torn apart

From the mouths of babes and fools
Hunted melodies
With gracefulness and ease
Compose their gifted words
Orchestrate their moves
Echo the perfect praise
Serenade

Dance a wild dance, be torn apart

Prophets tell the tale
The legend and the lies
The fable and the rhymes
The chant of a thousand-fold
The song of a billion strong
Echoes the perfect praise
