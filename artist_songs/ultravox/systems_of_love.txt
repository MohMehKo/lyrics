When everyone else is uncertain
And walls are closing in
There's no-one to hear you
No-one at all
Don't tell me what to believe in
Wake up and start again
Be part of the vision
Be part of it all
Don't you give me compassion
Just give me it all

[Chorus:]
Are you strong enough?
Can you stand above?
This is survival
Not systems of love
Don't you give up
It's never enough
Live for survival
Not systems of love

One way conversation
Won't you let me in
Don't let indecision
Ruin it all
Inside information
What a fool I've been
I spend every moment
Regretting it all
Just reliving the moment
That I heard the call

[Chorus]

Be my disciple
All I ask is put your faith in me
There's a better way, you know it
Don't be afraid of divine technology

[Chorus]
