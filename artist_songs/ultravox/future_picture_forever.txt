Time rolled by and I held out my hand and touched an illusion
That I would find...if I could see in the future
And I could tear up the picture
The future picture forever... and ever

Lying was good for I teased it with my hand
When outside in the wilds..
If I could see the future
And I could tear up the picture
The future picture forever... and ever...and ever

I the fool and I just don't understand 
One last history...good time to you
If I could see the future
And I could tear up the picture
The future picture forever... and ever...and ever

If I could see the future
And I would tear up the picture
The future picture forever...
ooohhh
The future picture forever...
The future picture forever...
The future picture forever...
