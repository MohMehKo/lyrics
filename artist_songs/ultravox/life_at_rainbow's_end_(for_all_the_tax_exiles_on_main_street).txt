Streets I knew were raining, changing
Addresses were rearranging
The cold boy from the suburbs, he left there
He'd read the book of no return

And me, I burnt your picture 
For the ashes of the lords
For you had played your games too well 
As the martyr and the boss

I suppose I chose a 
Good introduction 
From a formerly trusted friend
A good introduction 
To life at rainbow's end
Life at rainbow's end
Life at rainbow's end

Here I am a millionaire
Sewn into these dreams
I burnt all the maps that lead here
So no one can ever follow me

Only lonely parties start 
At the dark side of this world
The gangster with the golden arm 
Plays death cards for the girls

I saw the final vicar 
Make confession to a dancer
We stood upon the bridge at dawn 
And the dancer kissed my cancer

I suppose I chose a 
Good introduction 
From a formerly trusted friend
A good introduction 
To life at rainbow's end
Life at rainbow's end
Life at rainbow's end
