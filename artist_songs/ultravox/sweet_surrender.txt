Sweet sweet sweet surrender
Sweet sweet sweet surrender
Sweet sweet sweet surrender
Sweet sweet sweet surrender
Searching the institution
Chasing the grand illusion
All the way, away
Turn every stone to find it
Filling my empty mind
It falls away, away

Beats on my devotions
Like a hammer hits a nail
With your sweet surrender
Fill up my emotions
Like a wind fills out a sail
With your sweet surrender

Beats on my devotions
Like a hammer hits a nail
With your sweet surrender
Fill up my emotions
Like a wind fills out a sail
With your sweet surrender

Finding the key to open
A heart that was never broken
With a smile, a smile
Look for whoever sold me
On a feeling nobody told me
Could be wild, so wild

Sweet sweet sweet surrender
Sweet sweet sweet surrender
Sweet sweet sweet surrender
Sweet sweet sweet surrender
Searching the institution
Chasing the grand illusion
All the way, away
Turn every stone to find it
Filling my empty mind
It falls away, away

Beats on my devotions
Like a hammer hits a nail
With your sweet surrender
Fill up my emotions
Like a wind fills out a sail
With your sweet surrender

Beats on my devotions
Like a hammer hits a nail
With your sweet surrender
Fill up my emotions
Like a wind fills out a sail
With your sweet surrender

Beat on my devotions
Like a hammer hits a nail
It's a sweet surrender

Sweet sweet sweet surrender
Sweet sweet sweet surrender

Beat on my devotions
Like a hammer hits a nail
It's a sweet surrender

Sweet sweet sweet surrender
Sweet sweet sweet surrender

Beat on my devotions
Like a hammer hits a nail
It's a sweet surrender

Sweet sweet sweet surrender
Sweet sweet sweet surrender
