Follow, follow
Follow, follow your heart
There must be something to rely on
Follow your own way
Follow, follow
Follow, follow your heart
There must be someone to depend on
Follow your own way

We were the listeners, we were believers
Of a thousand lies
(Follow your heart)
And it gave us what we have today
We heard the preachings, we heard the gospel
Tried to turn the tides
(Follow your heart)
Oh, as it washes our hopes away

Follow, follow
Follow, follow your heart
There must be something to rely on
Follow your own way
Follow, follow
Follow, follow your heart
There must be someone to depend on
Follow your own way

Don't ask the questions, follow the leader
Just like a good boy will
(Follow your heart)
And I wonder what's in store for me
Don't need the prophets, don't need the seer
Don't need the overkill
(Follow your heart)
Oh and I wonder what could be

Follow, follow
Follow, follow your heart
There must be something to rely on
Follow your own way
Follow, follow
Follow, follow your heart
There must be someone to depend on
Follow your own way...
