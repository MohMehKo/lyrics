Oh yeah!

Oh - it's automatic (narcotic) let's ride
Four turkeys in a big black car
The road is shiny (black shine) the wheels slide
It all goes for a dangerous ride
The lacquer crackles (black car) the engine roars
A ship is turning, they come back to the shore
Splish splash I was raking in the cash
The biology of purpose keeps my nose above the surface

King's lead hat was a mother to desire
It will come, it will come, it will surely come
King's lead hat put the innocence inside her
It will come, it will come, it will surely come

In New Delhi and Hong Kong
We all know that it won't be long
I count my fingers (here she comes) as night falls
And draw bananas on the bathroon walls
The killer cycles (hum drum) the killer hertz
The passage of my life is measured out in shirts
Time and motion (motion carried) time and tide
All I know and all I have is time and time and tide is on my side

King's lead hat was a poker in the fire
It will come, it will come, it will surely come
King's lead hat was a mother to desire
It will come, it will come, it will surely come

The weapon's ready, the gun's on
The satellite can toss and turn
The captain's here (sieg heil) but nobody hears
The king's hat fits over their ears
He dials zero (cold line) on every time
He tries to dial out 999999999
He dials reception, he's all alone
He's just a victim of the telephone

King's lead hat made the Amazon much wider
It will come, it will come, it will surely come
King's lead hat was a mother to desire
It will come, it will come, it will surely come
King's lead hat put the innocence inside her
It will come, it will come, it will surely come
King's lead hat was the poker in the fire
It will come, it will come, it will surely come

Oh yeah!
