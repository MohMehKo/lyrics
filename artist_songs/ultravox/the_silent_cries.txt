You're hopeful of everything
To do what you want to
Belief in high to the inner self
Taste for the finer things
The beat becomes your backbone, no
Will always be leading you astray

[Chorus:]
Don't leave your spades to the hands that wait
Don't leave your life behind and ignore the silence
And do this spades, understand your place
Don't leave your love behind and ignore the silent cries

Your hope should mean everything
Your needing is often you
Forced into a black and white
Your left on eternal way
The few were building up on you
The symptom of a changing age

[Chorus x2]

The silent, the silent...
