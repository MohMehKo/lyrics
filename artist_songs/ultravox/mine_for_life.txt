A life as a stranger
Hands through a wire
Forbidden desires
Are mine for life

Looking
From a spiral staircase
At a man with a suitcase
As he shades his eyes

Watching
From a stained glass shelter
He bides his time and thinks
There must be more to life than this

A life as a stranger
Hands through a wire
Forbidden desires
Are mine for life

The poet
Reads his words out loud
To a make-believe crowd
In the quiet of his room

Careful
Where the tears are falling
He closed the book and cried
There must be more to love than this

See the boy
On the walkway
Where the young have their own say
And it screams from the wall

He's writing
For the hundredth time there
I hate it all, but
There must be more to hate than this

A life as a stranger
Hands through a wire
Forbidden desires
Are mine for life

A life as a stranger
Hands through a wire
Forbidden desires
Are mine for life

A life as a stranger
Hands through a wire
Forbidden desires
Are mine for life

A life as a stranger
Hands through a wire
Forbidden desires
Are mine for life
