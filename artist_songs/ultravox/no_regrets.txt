I know you're leaving but it's too long overdue
For far too long, I've had nothing new to show to you
Goodbye, dry eyes, I've watched your 'plane fade off west of the moon
And it felt so strange to walk away alone

[Chorus:]
There's no regrets
No tears goodbye
I don't want you back
We'd only cry again
Say goodbye again

The hours that were yours echo like empty rooms
The thoughts we used to share I now keep alone
I woke last night and spoke to you
Not thinking you were gone
And it felt so strange to lie awake alone

[Chorus]
