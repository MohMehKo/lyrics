Running down an empty street
Perhaps it was a railway station
Smell of eau de cologne
The sound of a celebration

[Chorus:]
Oh-oh-oh, dislocation
Oh-oh-oh, dislocation

Just a swimmer growing dimmer
In the glimmer of a summer
Waving gladly, swimming madly
Never, never going under

[Chorus]

The Sun was going down
One quiet evening
Someone came into the room
While I was half-asleep
We spoke for a while
I couldn't see his face
Later on when he was gone
I realized I didn't catch his name

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

Just a swimmer growing dimmer
In the glimmer of a summer
Waving gladly, swimming madly
Never, never going under
