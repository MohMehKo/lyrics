First of all, do you all dream?
Yes we do
The difference between our systems is that
Some of us remember our dreams better than others
Do you all dream, every night?
Yes we do
It's part of, a regular part of our sleep
Yes it is
Does it affect the quality of our sleep?
Only if we wake up from the dreams
And we find our dreams disturbing...
