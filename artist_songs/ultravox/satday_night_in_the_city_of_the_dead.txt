Right!

Fat guy jets by, bony in a zodiac
Picking up trouble, maybe looking for a heart attack
All-night boys in the Piccadilly Arcade
Boozy losers cruising, maybe trawling for some rough trade

Sat'day night
Sat'day night

Sat'day night in the city of the dead
(Hey!)
Can you feel the time bomb ticking in your head?
(Hey!)
Too many memories are burning in your bed
(Hey!)
Sat'day night in the city of the dead

Stands in the dole queue, face like a statue
Laugh like a maniac, walk like a king too
Spiked hair, don't care, Oxfam outlaw
Rap band rips it out, you're buzzing like a chainsaw

Sat'day night
Sat'day night

Sat'day night in the city of the dead
(Hey!)
Can you feel the time bomb ticking in your head?
(Hey!)
Too many memories are waiting in your bed
(Hey!)
Sat'day night in the city of the dead

High-rise reptile sucking on a cigarette
Ripped suit, zip boots, dancing like an insect
Tottenham court road, litter skitters in the wind
My, the city's pretty dead but the nights are still alive

Sat'day night
Sat'day night

Sat'day night in the city of the dead
(Hey!)
Can you feel the time bomb ticking in your head?
(Hey!)
Too many memories are waiting in your bed
(Hey!)
Sat'day night in the city of the dead

Sat'day night
Sat'day night
Sat'day night
Sat'day night in the city of the dead

Sat'day night
Sat'day night
Sat'day night

[Repeat and fade]
