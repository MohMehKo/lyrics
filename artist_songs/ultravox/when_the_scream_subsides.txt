[Chorus:]
(And we talked) just the two of us
(All the time) nothing serious
(We pretend) time is on our side
('Til the end) when the scream subsides

Yes, we had it all, had the key gripped in our hands
We could see the fall as a martyr understands
When the chorus calls there's no room for hope inside
Lose it all when the scream subsides

[Chorus]

Yes, we took the role of the lovers and the friends
And we played the parts 'til the words came to an end
But the tongues were tied in the passion and the pride
Wasted all when the scream subsides

(And we talked)
(All the time)
(We pretend)
('Til the end)

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
