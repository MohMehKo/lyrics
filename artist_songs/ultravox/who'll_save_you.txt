Please yourself
Only solitary kind
Be yourself
When there's no one else around

There's hope around
Story told to man to foe 

Who will save you?
Who will still be seen?
Who will break it?
Who else will save it?
Tell me who?

Bleed yourself
Only you know jewels you found
Feed yourself
Before you're driven and around

There's hope around
The lies you told come down to talk

Held this chain
To let it go to late

And I will wait for you
The distance for you to

Who will save you?
Who will still be seen?
Who will break it?
Who else will save it?
Tell me who?
