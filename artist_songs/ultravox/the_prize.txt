The prize is worth the working for
The prize is worth the waiting for

Waiting for years in the dirt and the tears is no compromise
Stand up and fight for the right to be someone in others' eyes
The popular sin of us all giving in won't reveal the prize

The prize is worth the working for
The prize is worth the waiting for

Running up hills and the battle of wills used to wear you down
The pressures of life used to cut like a knife at this humble clown
The taunts and the jokes of the carnival chokes on your fearful cries
The popular sin of us all giving in won't reveal the prize

The prize is worth the working for
The prize is worth the waiting for

You were the proud believer
Oh don't you want that pride again?
The prize

The prize is worth the working for
The prize is worth the waiting for...
