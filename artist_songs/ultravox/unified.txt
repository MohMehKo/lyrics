You give me exaltation
Like a rush from the morning air
All the endless roads we've taken
Don't mean a thing I swear
Destiny brought us together

[Chorus:]
We've all that we need
As long as we're side by side
We are sanctified
I'll be the air that you breath
And you'll bring me life
Tonight we are unified

You're stronger than emotion
Surrounding me inside
This is the perfect time
I feed on your devotion
The eternal flame of life
This is the reason I
Feel destiny brought us together

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
