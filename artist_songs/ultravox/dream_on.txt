Hold my breath and pray for something better
Close my eyes and wish for something better
Much better
Dream on
Dream on

I saw a day when there was no fight to fight
Dream on
Dream on
Nothing more, no hurting for no reason
What reason?
Dream on
Dream on

I heard a world laugh together for a while
Dream on
Dream on
I saw the strength and the love behind the smiles
Dream on
Dream on
Something good for everyone to share
To care
Dream on
Dream on...
