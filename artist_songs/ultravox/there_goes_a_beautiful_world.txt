Spinning round, demanding a gentle way
Rushed up crowd, had to go off the way

[Chorus:]
Oh, the circumstances detailed
The force of the run
Oh, the messages unfold
There goes a beautiful world

Higher ground, safe from the open way
Desert hound, try to get hold of me

[Chorus x2]

There goes a beautiful world
There goes a beautiful world

[Chorus x2]

There goes a beautiful world
There goes a beautiful world
