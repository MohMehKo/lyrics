So the victim ever comes
And the lies won't give at all
Who asked for a change?
Me!
Just need more time
And to put things right
Give your recline
Give it all up, give it all back

So to be strong never men
Does he hold out for a brand new world?
Who said things could change?
Try!
And how we try
Could break down lies
Tell me what's my line?
Give it all up, give it all back
Give it all up, give it all back
Give it all up, give it all back

Give it all up, give it all back
Give it all up, give it all back
Give it all up, give it all back
Give it all up, give it all back
