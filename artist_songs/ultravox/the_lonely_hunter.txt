I'm a lonely hunter, a hungry ghost
When you call a passion, you must pay the host

Look upon me as I thunder
I wonder if you wonder
How it feels to be 
The lonely hunter?

Lonely hunter
Lonely hunter
Lonely hunter

The wind blows clouds across my cheek
My collar's up and my coat is sleek

Look upon me as I plunder
I wonder if you wonder
How it feels to be 
The lonely hunter?

Achtung!
