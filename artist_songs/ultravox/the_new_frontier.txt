Try to understand
As I take you by the hand
Side by side
We'll begin again
Find a future in this land
If we try

And as we come together
We're guided by the light
This is more than just adventure
As destiny unfolds for you and I

[Chorus 1:]
We are not alone
We can build a better future
Way beyond the new frontier
We can overcome
Hear the bells of liberation
The days of independence will be won

Haunted by the pain
We will rise again, testify
The hand that turns the page
The child that came of age
It feels so right

As we set the world in motion
We cross the sands of time
There will be an answer
As destiny unfolds for you and I

[Chorus 2:]
We are not alone
We can build a better future
Way beyond the new frontier
Together we are one
Hear the bells of liberation
The days of independence have begin

As the line remains unbroken
We'll set sail tonight
There is cause for celebration
As destiny unfolds for you and I

[Chorus 2]
