Strange how the change came
All in a day
Counting down and counting down
And waiting for the minute
We could touch a world
Where every heart had love to offer

Heart-felt passion
Building around
Feel the love
Feel the love
Sharing the strain
From where apathy reigns
For a dying world

All in one day
All in one day
When the hands reached out across an ocean
Everywhere

All in one day
All in one day
When the people came and stood together
Everywhere

All in one day
All in one day
When the hands reached out across an ocean
Everywhere
