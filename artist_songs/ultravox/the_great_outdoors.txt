You stand out of the crowd
You don't follow the shadows
You've given me solid ground
You rise above
All that surrounds you
And I can't believe what I've found

[Chorus:]
And I am falling through the hands of time
As I discover within my mind
That I, if I can leave the hurt behind
Then what's mine is yours
Save the great outdoors for another time

You've opened my eyes
To a world of intentions
And I've just begin to realise
That so many times
Too many to mention
We let the moment pass us by

[Chorus]

And through all this confusion
We create our own kind
Don't let destiny leave you behind

[Chorus]
