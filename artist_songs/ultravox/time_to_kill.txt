Sitting on a train going round, round, get around
Looking at the same old places
Going up, down, to and fro, leave it all behind
It's a really good time
It's a really good waste of
Time for the taking
Turn it into something more than just
Time to kill

Driving down the road in a flip top motor car
Smiling at my strange reflection
Thinking buy one, have one, anyway you want one
It's a really bad time
It's a really bad waste of
Time for the taking
Turn it into something more than just
Time to kill

Watch those minutes turn to hours
Watch those hours turn to days
Watch those days turn into years
Time to kill

Talking with my friend on a seaside promenade
Whispering old conversations
Going chit chat, fancy that, going on for hours
It's a really good time
It's a really bad waste of
Time for the taking
Turn it into something more than just
Time to kill
