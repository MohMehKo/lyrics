[Chorus:]
(Welcome to)
(Welcome to)
(Welcome to the song)

Hear the words of the syncopated rhythms
Welcome to the song
And when it calls you
Time to move on, we go

[Chorus]

Feel the strength of a hundred thousand heartbeats
Cry welcome to the song
And as it lifts you
Time to move on, we go

[Chorus]

Drawn from the inside
Time to move on

We go
We go
