[Verse 1 - Fabolous:]
Shout out to my day-o, inni yayo
That white shit put me on the bread, I should call it mayo
And my niggas go all out, I should call 'em "A.O"
That Choppa lay you down, you can't get up, I call it K.O
Yeah, J.O., that's what I call jump off
Your baby baby momma on the dick, and she don't wanna jump off
Sucka found out, hit the roof and jumped off
It's fucked up that a jump off, made a nigga jump off

Bitch we live like kingpins, vacation in Cabo
Bossed up, El Fabo
No money, no hablo
Cubana or Hablo

[Verse 2 - Snootie Wild:]
Yeah, yayo, yeah, I just say yayo
Taste just like the Candy Cane but whiter than that pure snow
And why d'you try to play me and you know you selling guapo?
When you with the boss, then I got the say so
Aye, oh no, hit these licks like oh no
Counting all this mula paper, you can call it mucho
Cause I be rockin' all this paper, movin' weight like macho
I be eatin' nacho... cheese - guapo

He gon' ship 'em off, pfffiu, torpedo!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3 - Jadakiss:]
I swear, ha-haaah
Yayo, yayo, all I know is yayo
You feel some type of way, y'all dudes know I let that K go
Couple dudes is nice, the rest of y'all just in the way tho
The coke is from Colombia, the kush is from LA though
I get it in the mail; I got some people on the payroll
Let it sit, they like it even better when it's a day old
Money sure will get you either shot, stabbed or K.Od
Whatever I say go: y'all know, they know
Extendo out the window, motherfucking broad day though
Devil with the pitchfork or the angel with the halo
Spanish mami with me, fat ass - J-Lo
She ask me what I knew, I told her all I know is yayo

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4 - YG:]
Aye, it's yayo, on the block, when it's hot like a muthafucka
The price drop, the homies cut like a muthafucka
The homie turned to a chef and the fiends love him
These niggas on the block selling all day
These niggas living like Penny Hardaway
Nigga bust a whole bird down sellin' ounce to ounce
For you more money, but that's a harder way
Niggas just got out on motherfuckin' bail
He just got a pack in the motherfuckin' mail
Push it overseas, "How it's smell?"
Niggas like: "Ooh, that's that Scarface!
Ooh, this shit look sauteed
Ooh it smell so tart, eh
Ooh, we movin' work like Hova moved the Nets to Barclays
Ooh, we them niggas
Ooh, we got them hittaz
Ooh, that yayo bakin' soda freein' like yo niggas"
Hold up
(Shh) On the phone, niggas don't talk now
Cause niggas get in that interrogation room and they bitch out
Uh-oh!

[Verse 5 - French Montana:]
Yayo, Yayo, all we need is yayo
Killers on the payroll
Clap, you sniff some yayo
Dyckman got that yayo
Heights got that yayo
Forlter got that yayo
Broadway got that yayo
Yayo yayo, trafficking that yayo
If they pull us over, Buju Banton time with that yayo
Beaucoup with that yayo
Coo Coo with that yayo
Soda on the side, Chicken noodle with that yayo
Pablo and Diego, swallowin' that yayo
Flights from Republic, damn it, doodoo in that yayo
My nigga down south got a plug on that yayo
Catch me up top, 'bout fifty for that yayo
Coke boy

All I know is Yayo
