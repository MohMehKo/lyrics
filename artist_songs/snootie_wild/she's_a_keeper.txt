[August Alsina:]
She's a keeper

[Snootie Wild:]
Eyyyy Eyyyy Eyyyy... unhhhhh huhhhh

[Hook - August Alsina:]
She's a keeper
He don't know what to do
She's a keeper
I wanna be with...
She's a keeper
He don't know what to do with you
She's a keeper
He don't know what to do

He don't know what to do (he don't know what to do)
Baby you too bad
And you got all that ass
We both know that (I wanna be with...)
Cause she's a keeper
Girl, your the trillest fa'sho
Down to ride when I'm ready to go, that's one hunnid I thought you should know, you ain't like other hoes

[Snootie Wild:]
She came straight from the ghetto
Ass all on the strip pole
Cashed out with' a bankroll
Now she focused on college (eyy)
And I know that she polished
Daddy used to swang yayo
Now he locked down on death row
Independent, she got it
And I know I'm a get her
And she know that I want her
Five star in my city
Need that in my corner
Five packs for the fifty
Posted up on the corner
Used to watching her daily
Walk to school from my corner
Nigga drivin' her crazy
He just a sperm donor
Real estate that pussy
Let em know I'm the owner
Thorough bred, and I know so
All about her gold robe
Dude must be loco
That's why I won't let go

[Hook]

[Yo Gotti:]
He don't know what to do with you
If he did he wouldn't put you through
All the things that he put you through
Now a street nigga wanna fuck with you
You allergic to these lame niggas, might break ya out like allergies
I'll turn ya dream into ya reality
Killin hoes, you a casualty
And you the one, I ain't gotta tell you that though
Confidence high, yeah you already know
I'll send a jet to ya city just to bring ya to the show
Turn ya house into a mall, turn ya closet into a store
I know ya like that
Not the gifts, but the time that I spend with ya
I'm trynna build somethin, win with ya (I am)
Hope this shit here never ever end with ya (nah nah nah)
I can be ya man and friends with ya

You a main chick, that shit mandatory (nah nah nah)
Ain't no other bitches in yo category (nah nah nah)
Plus you a down bitch, that's another story (nah nah nah)
And you a real rider when it's necessary (nah nah nah)
So you a keeper
