Jack confides in Catherine
That he's filing for divorce
Catherine gives her promise
To keep it secret but of course
As soon as backs are turned in soaps
They're sharpening their claws
Meanwhile my whole world is collapsing

The congregation's nervous
Especially bride to be
There's three of them she'd rather have
Gone down on bended knee
Credits roll on "speak up now
or forever hold your peace"
Meanwhile my whole world is collapsing

It's pretty odd some two bob god
Can somehow grip the nation
But maybe to us sad old mares
It's a form of consolation
Makes us feel creative
In a life minus creation
Meanwhile our whole world is collapsing
Look out on the streets outside
Catch a conversation
The whole wide world is collapsing

The oldest of the brothers
The audience thought was dead
Returns to find his sister and his wife
Tucked up in bed
If this is true to life
Feed me fantasy instead
Meanwhile the whole world is collapsing

It's pretty odd some two bob god
Can somehow grip the nation
But maybe to us sad old mares
It's a form of consolation
Makes us feel creative
In a life minus creation
Meanwhile our whole world is collapsing
Riots on the streets outside
They're tearing up a nation
The whole wide world is collapsing

These petty little problems
They bring into our home
We actually tend to laugh about
Cause ours would not get shown
And sufferings so much funnier
When it's theirs and not your own
Meanwhile your whole world is collapsing
