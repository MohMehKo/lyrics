There's something very English about 'forever' 
'Hugs and kisses' are English too 
'Forever and a day' has to be American 
But 'hold me close' is me and you 
'Hold me close' is me and you 

So pilots do it in the air 
And surfers do it wave after wave 
But soon they'll be looking limp and lifeless 
We'll still be at it in our grave 

Hold me close, underground 
Hold me close, underground 
I'll be there, I'll wait for you 
In with the old, out with the new 

'Man and wife' just doesn't suit us 
'Just us two' is hardly true 
I couldn't care about Mr and Mrs 
But 'you and I' is me and you 
'You and I' is me and you 

Potholers do it with the lights off 
Hikers do it long and slow 
I'll still be trying to get your clothes off 
When I lie 6ft below 

Hold me close, underground 
Hold me close, underground 
I'll be there, I'll wait for you 
In with the old, out with the new 

I'll be there, I'll wait for you 
Hold me close, underground 
In with the old, out with the new 
Hold me close, underground 

When it's turned to overbearing 
You and I will still be here
