The perfect love song it has no words it only has death threats 
And you can tell a classic ballad by how threatening it gets 
So if you walk into your house and she's cutting up your mother 
She's only trying to tell you that she loves you like no other 
No other, she loves you like no other. 

The only emotions that I know are love and hate 
And she's chopping & she's changing & it's making you afraid 
I said close your eyes and imagine that I'm nice 
She'll kiss you or she'll kill you but you'll just have to wait 

Because some things that I do make you go blue 
And something that you said made me go red 

The perfect love has no emotions, it only harbours doubt 
And if she fears your intentions she will cut you out 
So do not raise your voice and do not shake your fist 
Just pass her the carving knife, if that's what she insists 
Insists, if that's what she insists 

A hate tattoo on my brain and a love one on my heart 
I'd love to hate you, like I love you 
and just tear your dreams apart 
I said close your eyes and imagine that I'm nice 
Cupid's arrow looking more like Cupid's poisoned dart 

Because some things that I do make you go blue 
And something that you said made me go red 

Because some things that I do make you go blue 
And something that you said made me go red 

The perfect kiss is dry as sand and doesn't take your breath 
The perfect kiss is with the boy that you've just stabbed to death 

Is with the boy that you've just stabbed to death 
Is with the boy that you've just stabbed to death
