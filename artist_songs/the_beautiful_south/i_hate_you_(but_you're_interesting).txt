Tables turned over and curtains ripped 
Bottles uncollected, collected here 
Nothing seems to shine like these razor edges do 
It's a crazy little world without you 

I went to see a doctor and she said 'Yes, go ahead' 
'Throw yourself into the sea' 
I wrote a will for my friends 
And this is how it read 
'Me, me, me, me, me, me, me' 
No friends, everything for me, me, me 
No friends, just me, just me 

Fleet Street was a very funny place 
Home to the mad and the corrupt 
What would you say if I told you today 
I'd made this whole story up? 

I made this whole story up
