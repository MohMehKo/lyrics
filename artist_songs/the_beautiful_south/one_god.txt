Like the toupee on a fading fame 
The final whistle in a losing game 
Thick lipstick on a five year old girl 
It makes you think it's a plastic world 

A plastic world and we're all plastic too 
Just a couple of different faces in a dead man's queue 
The world is turning Disney and there's nothing you can do 
You're trying to walk like giants 
but you're wearing Pluto's shoes 

And the answers fall easier from the barrel of a gun 
Than it does from the lips of the beautiful and the dumb 
The world won't end in darkness, it'll end in family fun 
With Coca Cola clouds behind a Big Mac sun 

A howling scream in a church asleep 
Rusty bicycle in an ocean deep 
Like an ear-ring on the newly born 
Strong perfume on a winter's morn 

The world is perfumed and we're perfumed as well 
Petals from a flower that blossomed in hell 
And you can't breathe the air through the thickness of the smell 
And you can't see the hair through the grease of the gel 

And the answers fall easier from the barrel of a gun 
Than it does from the lips of the beautiful and the dumb 
The world won't end in darkness, it'll end in family fun 
With Coca Cola clouds behind a Big Mac sun 

You say there's only one God, you could do with two or three 
Your Jesus Christ is hired out, like the slag of Galilee 
Well if Peter is a prostitute, then what does that make me 

There's only one God 
There should be two or three 
One God 
There should be two or three 
One God 
There should be two or three 
Two or three
