Sailin' away on the crest of a wave
It's like magic
Rollin' and ridin' and slippin' & slidin'
It's magic

And you, and your sweet desire,
You took me,
Higher and higher, baby
It's a livin' thing,
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose.

Making believe this is what you've conceived
From your worst day, (I'm taking a dive)
Moving in line when you look back in time
To your first day (I'm taking I'm taking)

And you, and your sweet desire,
You took me,
Higher and higher baby
It's a livin' thing,
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose.

Takin' a dive 'cos you can't halt the slide
Floating downstream, (I'm taking a dive)
So let her go don't start spoiling the show
It's a bad dream (I'm taking I'm taking)

And you, and your sweet desire,
You took me,
Higher and higher baby
It's a livin' thing,
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose.
