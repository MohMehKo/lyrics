Valentine.
Won't you be my valentine.
And introduce your heart to mine
And be my valentine.

Summertime.
We could run and play like summertime
With storybooks and nursery rhymes.
So be my valentine.

Candy heart.
If anyone could, you could have a candy heart.
You're the sweetest of all sweethearts.
Won't you give your heart to me.
Can't you see

I love you valentine.
Won't you be my valentine.
And won't you share your space with mine.
And be my valentine.

Candy heart.
If anyone could, you could have a candy heart.
You're the sweetest of all sweethearts.
Won't you give your heart to me.
Can't you see

I love you valentine.
Won't you be my valentine
And introduce your heart to mine.
And be my valentine.

Valentine
Valentine
And be my valentine
