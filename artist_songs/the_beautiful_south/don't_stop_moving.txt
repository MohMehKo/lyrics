DJ's got the party started
There's no end in sight
Everybody's movin to the rhythm that's inside
It's a crazy world
But tonight's the right situation
Don't get left behind

I can feel the music
Moving through me everywhere
Ain't no destination baby
We don't even care
There's a place to be
If you need the right education
Let it take you there

Just go
With the magic baby
I can see it there in your eyes (I can see it there in your eyes)
Let it flow and stop the waiting
Right here on the dance floor
Is where you gotta let it go

Don't stop movin'
Can you feel the music
DJ's got us going around, 'round
Don't stop movin'
Find your own way to it
Listen to the music
Taking you to places that you've never been before
Baby now

You can touch the moment
Almost feel it in the air
Don't know where we're goin
Baby, we don't even care
Ain't no mystery
Just use your imagination
Let it take you there

Just go
With the magic baby
I can see it there in your eyes (I can see it there in your eyes)
Let it flow
Stop the waiting
Right here on the dancefloor
Is where you gotta let it go

Don't stop movin'
Can you feel the music
DJ's got us going around, 'round
Don't stop movin'
Find your own way to it
Listen to the music
Taking you to places that you've never been before
Baby now

Forget about your fears tonight
Listen to your heart
Let's just touch the sky (listen to your heart)
No need to reason why
Just listen to the sound
Let it make you come alive

Don't stop movin'
Can you feel the music
DJ's got us going around, 'round
Don't stop movin'
Find your own way to it
Listen to the music
Taking you to places that you've never been before
Baby now
Baby now
Baby now

DJ's got us moving around, right 'round, right 'round
DJ's got us moving around
