There's a bench in every park dedicated to
Those who sat there once but didn't make it through
There are names carved deep in bark on every tree
By those who spent their time like you and me

And wherever geography may place you now
There's a piece of history all folk carry around
Whatever your situation, whatever it may allow
There's an even larger piece in every lost and found

There's a song
There's always a song
Wherever there's perfection
There's a wrong
There's always a song
But a broken bond
And an unkissed frog
In every village pond

There's a name that we graffiti'd up on a wall
To the folks who live there now, makes no sense at all
And in every underpass, on every street
A promise someone made but couldn't keep

A tiny piece of chalk in every coat
In every film the smallest lump in throat
In every song you've sung, every novel read
That unkissed love will always rear its head

There's a song
There's always a song
Wherever there's a right
There's always wrong
There's always a song
But a broken bond
And an unkissed frog
In every village pond
