Birds are singing in the trees 
As we rise up on a beautiful morning 
But I can't hear 
That beautiful sound 
Because I'm permanently yawning 

What about the time of the fancy dress 
When you came dressed as your mum 
And there I was splendid in my penguin suit 
So scared to show my bill 

You must have been listening to your Carousel 
Your Carousel, that Carousel 

Remember the time 
When I turned the house into a rocket ship 
And you refused to come to Mars 
You said "It's too far" 
You had to be back by six to watch your Carousel 
Saturn's much too far 
You had to watch Carousel (What's going on in there?) 

When we first met 
I asked you for your hand 
I didn't really mean that hand 
I meant join hands 
Bake phallic cake (Bake phallic cake) 
Carry round sticky tape 
And love those devil dogs 
Be an Indian elephant (Be an Indian elephant) 
Bait straight people 
But you must have missed my wink 
You must have missed my wink 

(I love you, 
But you're boring, you know, 
I really do love you 
But you're so particularly boring) 

Maybe you were too busy listening to Carousel 
watching Carousel, living Carousel 
You were listening to Carousel 
You were watching Carousel
