Why forbidden fruit always looks so sweet
Hanging down like devil's food, from highest branch on tree
Yes, woman should be satisfied
Be happy with her lot
But sometimes half of him
Seems better than the whole I've got
Yes, sometimes half of hell right here
Is better than a heaven forgot

Yeild not to temptation is only good advice
If true love happens just the once and never ever twice
Yes, woman should be satisfied
Be happy with her lot
But sometimes half of him
Seems better than the whole I've got
Yes, sometimes half of hell right here
Seems better than a heaven forgot

We were happy with happily ever after
But only if the plot
Had bad guys we could boo and hiss
And good guys we could not
We probably feel that second best
Could actually be much worse
But you're kind of drawn to chocolate
When you've tasted wafer first
Yes you're kind of drawn to chocolate
When you've tasted wafer first

Hunt me down like your other prey let your claws take hold
If what I've chosen's truly grey, make tiger black and gold
Yes, woman should be satisfied
Be happy with her lot
But sometimes half of him
Seems better than the whole I've got
Yes, sometimes half of hell right here
Is better than a heaven forgot

We were happy with happily ever after
But only if the plot
Had bad guys we could boo and hiss
And good guys we could not
We probably feel that second best
Could actually be much worse
But you're kinda drawn to chocolate
When you've tasted wafer first
Yes, you're kinda drawn to chocolate
When you've tasted wafer first

'I Can't Get No Satisfaction'
so sang all the guys
The biggest single breeding ground
For a girls 'I Will Survive'

We'll be happy with happily ever after
But only when the song
Admits 'Can't Get No Satisfaction'
Wasn't all our wrong
We probably feel that second best
Could actually be much worse
But you're kind of put off wafer
When you've tasted chocolate first
Yes, you're kinda put off wafer
When you've tasted chocolate first
