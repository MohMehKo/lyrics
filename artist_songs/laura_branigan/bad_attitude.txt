Drawn like a moth to a flame 
I've been consumed by the fire 
I've only got myself to blame 
I shoulda known better 
Than givin' into desire
And with an arrow through my heart 
I watch your image fall apart 
True colors blinding me 
I don't like what I see 

You know you got a bad attitude 
I wanna love you but you're too dumb animal
Raw like a diamond in the rough 
I think you're pretty but you're too tough

You see the glass half empty 
I see the glass half filled 
You try to tell me it's alright 
You say you're gonna change your ways
Oh baby I know you never will 

You know you got a bad attitude 
I wanna love you but you're too dumb animal 
Raw like a diamond in the rough 
I think you're pretty but you're too tough 
I don't need your bad attitude
It's hard to love you when you're too wild animal 
Raw like a diamond in the rough
I've had my fill babe enough is enough 

And with an arrow through my heart 
I watch your image fall apart 
True colors blinding me 
I'm not impressed with what I see 

Get out of here with your bad attitude 
I wanna love you but you're too wild animal 
Raw you're a diamond in the rough
I've had my fill babe enough is enough 

I don't need your bad attitude
It's hard to love you when you when you're too wild animal 
Raw you're a diamond in the rough 
You could be pretty but you're too tough 

I don't need, bad attitude 
I wanna love you, I wanna love you
