Maybe I love you, maybe I don't
Maybe I'll need you and maybe, baby, I won't
I guess I don't take the time
To let you know what's on my mind
Maybe I've been blind

Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I'm sane
Maybe I need to go away, start over again
But if I went away
I'd be afraid I should have stayed
Maybe I'm afraid that maybe I love you

And believe me when I tell you
It's because of all the things you say and do
That help me make it through
I need you
But when I try to say goodbye
I realize I won't know what to do
If I don't have you

Maybe I love you, baby I do
I guess I loved you
The first time I saw you
And when I don't take the time
To let you know what's on my mind
I know that I'm too damn blind
But baby I love you

Maybe I love you, maybe I don't
Maybe I'll need you and maybe, baby, I won't
I guess I don't take the time
To let you know what's on my mind
Maybe I've been blind, but maybe I love you
I love you
