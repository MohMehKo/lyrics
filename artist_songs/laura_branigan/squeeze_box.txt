Mama's got a squeeze box 
She wears on her chest
When daddy comes home
He never gets no rest 
'cos she's playin' all night
And the music's alright 

Mama's got a squeeze box
And daddy never sleeps at night 

Well, the kids don't eat
And the dog can't sleep 
There's no escape from the music
In the whole damn street 
'cos she's playin' all night
And the music's alright 

Mama's got a squeeze box
And daddy never sleeps at night 
She goes in and out and in and out
And in and out and in and out 
She's playin' all night
And the music's alright 

Mama's got a squeeze box
And daddy never sleeps at night
She goes "Squeeze me
Come on and squeeze me
Come on and tease me like you do
I'm so in love with you"
