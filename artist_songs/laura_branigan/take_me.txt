I fancied you for a very long time
You finally got around to makin' your move 
But when you picked me up, you looked so very... 
I wish we could dispense with the preliminaries 
Oh, so much for subtlety 
I can't wait for you to get your hands on me

Oh, take me, take me, please 
Oh, take me, take me

Don't leave me at the door with a good night kiss 
It's guys like you can give a girl a complex
I've never been so in love before 
I'm not playin' hard to get, that's for sure 
Oh, so much formality 
I can't wait for you to put your hands on me 

Oh, take me, take me, please 
Oh, take me, why don't you take me? 
Oh, take me, come on boy 
Oh, take me, take me

Oh, don't let me scare you away 
It's not like me to come on strong 
But love like this just can't be wrong 
So I'm gonna make it easy

Oh, take me, take me... 
It's the holdin' back makes me want you more
I'm not playin' hard to get 
Oh, why don't you take me, boy? 
Oh, oh, take me, come on, take me...
