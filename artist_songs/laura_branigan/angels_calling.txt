Everytime I see you
I get a feeling deep inside 
I want to be near you 
I want to be always by your side 
You know my wants, you know my needs 
You never turn your back on me
You know I play, you let me stray 
You're always there to rescue me 

Everytime I see you
Angels calling, stars are falling 
I hear sounds of love
When I'm near you 
Heavens singing hearts are ringing 
I hear sounds of love 

Everytime I see you 
I feel my secrets falling out 
When I'm near you 
I lose my defenses, drop my guards 
It's been so long, always so wrong
Love was never good to me 
I know you care, you're always there 
Your love was heaven sent to me

Everytime I see you
Angels calling stars are falling 
I hear sounds of love 
When I'm near you 
Heavens singing hearts are ringing 
I hear sounds of love
Everytime I'm near you 
My world is changing, fire's raging
I hear sounds of love
I want to be near you 
Shadows dancing, voices chanting 
I hear sounds of love 
You're all I want
You're all I need 
You're all I want 
You're life to me
You're life to me
