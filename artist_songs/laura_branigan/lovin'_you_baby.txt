I try to be all of the things you say I'm not
You never fail to remind me of what I haven't got
I get so tired of pleasin' you
You never give me a reason to
If you tell me you're leavin'
You know what I'd say

Where would I be, how could I live?
Where would I go and what would I give?
What can I say, how do I stand?
Where do I fall if there's no more lovin' you baby?

Sometimes it's harder stickin' around
Than seein' you go
And the way that you laugh about
It is your way of lettin' me know
You couldn't care less if I was gone
Still I keep on hangin' on
'Cos if you tell me you're leavin'
You know what I'd say

Where would I be, how could I live?
Where would I go and what would I give?
What can I say, how do I stand?
Where do I fall if there's no more lovin' you baby?

You couldn't care less if I was gone
Still I keep on hangin' on
'Cos if you tell me you're leavin'
You know what I'd say

Where would I be, how could I live?
Where would I go and what would I give?
What can I say, how do I stand?
Where do I fall if there's no more lovin' you baby?

No more lovin' you baby
Where would I be, how could I live?
Where would I go and what would I give?
What can I say, how do I stand?
Where do I fall if there's no more lovin' you baby?
