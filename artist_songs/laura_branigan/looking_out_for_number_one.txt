Looking out for number one 
Looking out for myself seems a fantasy 
Drifting out to sea into memory
Looking out for myself and I'm feeling good 

Make the moves I should,
hop that train, knew I could, ignore the pain 
And now I want it back, 'Cause I'm saint inside
Set free on time for myself not delight

Looking out for number one
Looking out for number one
Looking out for number one

When you told me the truth I just closed my eyes
But inside I knew it was no surprise
Now soon pack my things Left it all behind
Had to fill my life with something new Safe myself I needed you 
And now I want it back, 'Cause I'm saint inside
Set free on time for myself not delight

Looking out for number one
Looking out for number one
Looking out for number one

And no more keep this all for somebody else
Never knew it felt so good to be depending on no one but me
Now the worst is behind and I'm here to stay
No more practicing It's my turn to play
