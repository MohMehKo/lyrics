Was there light on the water when I fell in and drowned?
Did anyone see my body go down?
Did he call out "Someone help, she can't swim!"?
Or did he just laugh when I slipped and fell in?

I went down without a trace
And all I could see was a smile on his face
I fell in, was I pushed, did I fall?
But when I went down, I went down like a rock

Did anyone jump in or climb down the rungs
To catch me and save me and pump out my lungs?
I saw nobody cry on board, nobody offered a prayer
Did anyone notice, doesn't anyone care?

I went down without a trace
And all I could see was a smile on his face
I fell in, was I pushed, did I fall?
But when I went down, I went down like a rock
