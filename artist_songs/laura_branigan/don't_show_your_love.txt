Looking to find somebody new
That's what I've got in mind to do
Taking a chance
No one is there
People afraid to share

Don't show your love
Say no to love
Don't show your love to me
Take back your love
Say no to love
Don't show your love to me

Loneliness lives out in the world
People afraid to give
Better off free
Out on your own
Living your life alone

Don't show your love
Say no to love 
Don't show your love to me
Oh, take back your love
Say no to love
Don't show your love to me
