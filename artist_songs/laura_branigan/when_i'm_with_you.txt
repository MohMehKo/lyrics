I got this tension down in my bones
Feel it come whenever you're near
A new dimension that I can't control
I don't know what's happening here

'Cause one night with you and my heart just shatters
One night with you and now you're all that matters

I'm getting circles around my eyes 
Half awake half of the time 
This isn't like me to be insecure
But I've never had my heart on the line

'Cause one night with you and all my courage crumbles 
One night with you has made a strong girl stumble

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
And you do what you do the way you do
I feel just like a baby
Maybe I should be going, knowing 

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
That's all I want to do, is what you do 
And have you here to touch me, touch you 
You don't know how much I want to
When I'm with you 

Don't know if you want it
Just like I want it 
You keep me guessing most of the time
But I got to have it
Just like we had it
It's the only thing on my mind 

'Cause one night with you and all my courage crumbles 
One night with you has made a strong girl stumble

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
And you do what you do the way you do
I feel just like a baby
Maybe I should be going, knowing 

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
That's all I want to do, is what you do
And have you here to touch me, touch you
You don't know how much I want to
When I'm with you
