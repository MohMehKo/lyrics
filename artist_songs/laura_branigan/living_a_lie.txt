You've been callin' and there's no answer
Now you're wondering why
How'd you get in this situation?
Now it's your turn to cry

You're living a lie, you're wasting your time
Caught in a dream, you're living a lie
You're living a lie, you're wasting your time
Caught in a dream, you're living a lie

You keep wonderin' where she's goin'
Just to find where she's been
Could it be she no longer loves you?
Could it be it's the end?

You're living a lie, you're wasting your time
Caught in a dream, I said you're living a lie
You're living a lie, you're wasting your time
Caught in a dream, you're living a lie

Somebody better help this boy
He's chasing rainbows in the sky
But there's a fool in every boy
The things you never question why

You're living a lie, you're wasting your time
Caught in a dream, you're living a lie
You're living a lie, you're wasting your time
Caught in a dream, I said you're living a lie

You're living a lie, you're wasting your time
Caught in a dream, are you living a lie
You're living a lie, you're wasting your time
Caught in a dream, you're living a lie
You're living a lie, you're wasting your time
