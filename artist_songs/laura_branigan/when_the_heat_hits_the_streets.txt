You don't know if you're awake or dreaming
The sky is still and the city is screaming
You don't hear a sound but there's something in the air 
You don't know where you're going to be going
Your body is tired but the night keeps calling
Pushing you further and taking you higher
Turning your smoke into fire 

When the heat hits the street
It's gonna rock you off your feet
The pavement's moving to the beat
When the heat hits the street
You can lose yourself in the neon light
And your heartbeat echoes the sound of the night
If you have no name and you have it all 
If you lose yourself you can find your soul in the night 
When the heat hits the street

You're alone and your thoughts are racing 
Was it real or a dream you're chasing
You had it all but you let it slip away 
Searching the streets and the music's playing 
Somebody's calling but you're still waiting
You're going further and you're going you higher
Turning your smoke into fire 

When the heat hits the street
It's gonna rock you off your feet
Oh, the pavement's moving to the beat 
When the heat hits the street
You can lose yourself in the neon light
And your heartbeat echoes the sound of the night
If you have no name and you have it all 
If you lose yourself you can find your soul in the night 
When the heat hits the street

And you're racing with the wind
Moving so fast you're leaving time behind 
You're not coming back again
Going someplace 
Where no one has ever been

When the heat hits the street
It's gonna rock you off your feet
Oh, the pavement's moving to the beat 
When the heat hits the street
