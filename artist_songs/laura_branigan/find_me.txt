If you see me trembling 'cos you're near
Please come closer it's not you I fear
Find me, touch me, never let me go
Darlin', I'm so cold, hold me
If you hear me cryin' in my sleep
Kiss me gently hold me while I weep

Find me, touch me, never let me go
Find me, reach me, feel what I can't show
Darlin', I'm so cold, hold me

Because you're near me now
I'm so much braver now
No longer lost somehow with you with me
If you feel me pushin' you away
That's me simply beggin' you to stay

Find me, touch me, never let me go
Find me, reach me, feel what I can't show
Find me, love me, God I love you so
Darlin', I'm so cold, hold me
