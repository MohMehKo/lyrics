The days grow old like winters that creep slowly past
And the love grows cold like icicles against the glass
Now everything around me has changed
The magic of your touch remains

And I stand here feeling naked
Like a statue in the rain
A statue in the rain
Statue in the rain
Calling out your name

A photograph, a window to another time
As I watch the past, I feel your body dance to mine
Now everything about you has changed
The phantom only feeds the flame

Oh, I stand here feeling naked
Just like a statue in the rain
A statue in the rain
Statue in the rain
Calling out your name

Now I'm cold from my head to my toes
And I'm wet, I can never forget
How your love made me feel so alive
Thinking of you, my whole world is gray
As I wander through the magic of facing
One more day you're so far away

Now everything around me has changed
The magic of your touch still remains

And I stand here feeling naked
Like a statue in the rain
Just like a statue in the rain
A statue in the rain
Calling out your name

Now I'm cold from my head to my toes
(Statue in the rain)
And I'm wet, I can never forget
(Statue in the rain)
How your love made me feel so alive
(Statue in the rain)

Like a statue in the rain
A statue in the rain
Statue in the rain
Calling out your name
