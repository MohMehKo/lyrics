I confess I love you
But you don't believe me
You're on the rebound
And you don't want to get hurt again
I know you are fallin' But you don't want to let me know
You think it's safer not to let it show

You got your feelings locked away
For your protection
You think you keep them inside
Oh it's so obvious there's something
Here that can't be denied

You're building up a smoke screen
Trying to keep me in the dark
Trying to camouflage the way you feel
You're sending out a smoke screen
Acting like you're not in love
Making out it's no big deal
I know it
You know it
What are you afraid of

You're keeping a distance
For the sake of apppearances
Don't want to look like
You are ruled by your emotions
Surrender to your heart
Lift the veil that's keeping us apart

You're building up a smoke screen
Trying to keep me in the dark
Trying to camouflage the way you feel
You're sending out a smoke screen
Acting like you're not in love
Making out it's no big deal
I know it
You know it
Say the words you need to say
I know it
You know it
Blow the smoke away
I know it
You know it
Step out from behind the cloud
I know you love me just say it out loud

You got your feelings locked away
For your protection
You think you keep them inside
Oh it's so obvious there's something
Here that can't be denied
