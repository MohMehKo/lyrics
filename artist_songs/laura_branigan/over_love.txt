My head touches the pillow
Dreams of us come rushin' through
They light the dark like fireflies
Slowly fillin' up the room
Everywhere I look tonight 
I can see how I cried

Over love, over you
Over love there was nothing I could do
Over love, over you

I believe in magic
It clouds the mind like sweet perfume
It almost made me crazy
I could've died from the pleasures of me and you
Until the magic drifted away
I never thought I'd say

I'm over love, over you
Over love there was nothing I could do
Over love, over you
And so I'm turnin' on the light
Don't want to lose another night
Over love

Not gonna hurt anymore 
Not gonna do what I did before
Not gonna feel like I felt
Till I fall again

I'm over love, over you
Over love there was nothing I could do
Over love, over you
And so I'm turnin' on the light
Don't want to lose another night
Over love
