Driving through the city
As I look out through the window 
Wonderin what it's like to be sleepin' on the outside 
Watch me take a picture of the place that I grew up in 
Sorry mister, thought you look like someone I remember 
Someone I remember
Look at him still walking 
Like he knows somebody's watchin' 
If I try to talk to him I wonder if he'll know me 
C'mon say "Hey baby" won't you take a ride in my car
Maybe you can show me how we lost what we believe in

Just let me stay here
I'm running from I don't know 
Just let me stay here the night
I won't hurt you 
Don't stop me 
Just let me stay a while 
Just let me stay here for life 

I know it's been a while and the years have been unfaithful 
Is there nothing left of me that even looks familiar 
Everything was easy when we thought we had the answer 
Why you lookin' at me like I'm from another planet 

Just let me stay here 
I'm running from I don't know 
Just let me stay here the night 
I won't hurt you 
Don't stop me 
Just let me stay a while
Just let me stay here for life

Ooo eeee Oh
My lo say no
May you can let me in
