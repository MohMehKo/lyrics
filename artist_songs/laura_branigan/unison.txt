Somewhere tonight become alive
Two hearts at night 
We're one of a kind 
Here we are undivided by anything 
Just you and I 
We've come so far no one else could ever 
Steal away what we confide 
Who wants to know? 

We stick together we're never apart 
Everybody knows who we are
Because we are one
We do it in unison 

The look in your eye
The flash of your smile 
Never too shy 
Playin' ever so wild 
Baby here we are I'm relying on 
No one else 
But you and I 
We've come so far 
No one else could ever steal away what we confide
Who wants to know? 

We stick together we're never apart 
Everybody knows who we are
Because we are one
We do it in unison 
We've come together and stronger we are 
Just when the world tries to tear us apart 
We go on as one
We do it in unison

You and me 
As one 
We stay together 
We stay together 
Unison 

Baby here we are undivided by 
Anything just you and I 
We've come so far 
No one else could ever steal away what we confide 
Who wants to know? 

We stick together
We stick together
We stick together we're never apart 
Everybody knows who we are
Because we are one
We do it in unison 

We stick together we're never apart 
Everybody knows who we are 
Because we are one 
We do it in unison 
We've come together and stronger we are 
Just when the world can tear us apart 
We go on as one 
We do it in unison
