I fight the night 
To be alone has never frightened me 
Behind the light 
The shadow of your memory 
Oh, who are you to turn the knife 
I am not your sacrifice 
Who are you when I can get you out of my life?
Bet you didn't know 
That I would pack away my things and go 
And know it's true 
Gonna get along in spite of you 
Don't want to hear your alibis 
Don't want your part time compromise 
Who are you when I can get you out of my life?

Whatever I do wherever I go 
I'm never coming back to you 
Whatever you do wherever you go 
I'm gonna get over you 
Whatever I do wherever I go 
I'm never coming back to you 
Whatever you do wherever you go 
I'm gonna get over you

I stand alone 
Another victim of your fantasies 
I face the world, ooh 
I'm searching for my destiny 
Oh, who are you to tie me down 
When you were not always around 
Who are you when I can get you out of my life? 

Whatever I do wherever I go 
I'm never coming back to you 
Whatever you do wherever you go 
I'm gonna get over you 
Whatever I do wherever I go 
I'm never coming back to you 
Whatever you do wherever you go 
I'm gonna get over you 
Over you 

Oh, who are you to turn the knife 
I am not your sacrifice 
Who are you when I can get you out of my life? 

Whatever I do wherever I go 
I'm never coming back to you 
I'm never commin' back babe
Whatever you do wherever you go 
I'm gonna get over you 
Over you
