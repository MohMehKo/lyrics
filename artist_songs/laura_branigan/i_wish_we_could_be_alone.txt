I wish we could be alone
So all of the world couldn't see
How much we have together
And how much you mean to me
I wish we could put out the flame
But oh, sweet baby, tell me would it be right?
I take the subway and you take the train
I got a husband and you got a wife
I wish we could love and then not always have to pretend

I wish we could be alone, all alone
I wish we could be alone, all alone

I know it's not simple
But I know that it's strong
And I know it will never be easy
But I know it ain't wrong
I wish it could always be the way it is when you're kissin' me

I wish we could be alone, all alone
I wish we could be alone, all alone

And so we'll go on and on
Hidin' out the way that we do
Keepin' it from all of our friends
There ain't a nothin' between us two
I wish we could hang about
And not worry who's givin' in or out

I wish we could be alone, all alone
I wish we could be alone, all alone
I wish we could be alone, all alone
