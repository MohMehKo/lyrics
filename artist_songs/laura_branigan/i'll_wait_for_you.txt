Time, time gets the best of me 
Moving on endlessly, when we're apart 
Faith, faith is the strength I need
Faith is the inner key, the key to the heart 

Just a face in the crowd 
Is all that it takes for the memory 
Of that pale cool night, with you by my side 
When all that I wanted was you

Wherever we run, whatever we choose 
Whether we win or if we lose 
Until the sun no longer shines 
I'll wait for you

Wherever we run, whatever we choose
Whether or not our dreams come true 
Until we reach the end of time 
I'll wait for you 

You, you are my fantasy 
You are my destiny like the sea to the shore 
Faith, faith is the strength I need 
Faith is the inner key, the key to the heart

Just a face in the crowd
Is all that it takes for the memory 
Of that pale cool night, with you by my side 
When all that I wanted was you 

Wherever we run, whatever we choose
Whether we win or if we lose
Until the sun no longer shines
I'll wait for you

Wherever we run, whatever we choose
Whether or not our dreams come true
Until we reach the end of time 
I'll wait for you

I, I close my eyes and see
Your body next to me your lips on mine

Wherever we run, whatever we choose
Whether we win or if we lose
Until the sun no longer shines
I'll wait for you
