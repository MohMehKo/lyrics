You always run to me 
Whenever she leaves you 
We trade philosophy
But nothing can free you 
Too many poison arrows hit
The heart you've try to hide
Can't you say goodbye to this foolish lullaby?

Still you talk as if 
She didn't hurt you 
But I see what she did 
And you see the virtue
You refuse to hear the words
That lie behind your eyes
Can't you say goodbye to this foolish lullaby? 

If you are so sure that she's the one
Why are you lying here with me? 
Did it ever cross your mind at all 
Of how this feels to me?
I'll never know just what you see in her
I don't even want to try
I guess the both of us sing a foolish lullaby 

So we'll wear the goodbye look 
Collecting excuses 
For all the time it took
To hide the abuses 
The thorns around the roses left
Their mark below our eyes
Can't we say goodbye to this foolish lullaby?

If you are so sure that she's the one
Why are you lying here with me? 
Did it ever cross your mind at all 
Of how this feels to me?
I'll never know just what you see in her
I don't even want to try
I guess the both of us sing a foolish lullaby
