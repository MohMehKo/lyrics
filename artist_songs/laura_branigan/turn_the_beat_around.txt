Blow horns sure sound pretty
Violins keep movin' to the nitty gritty
When you hear the scratch of the guitars scratchin'
Then you'll know that rhythm carries all the action, woah

Turn the beat around, love to hear the percussion
Turn it upside down, love to hear the percussion
Love to hear it

Flute player play your flute 'cause
I know you want to get your thing off
But you see I've made up my mind about it
It's got to be the rhythm, no doubt about it, woah

And when the guitar player starts playing
That syncopated rhythm with the scratch, scratch, scratch
Makes you wanna move your body, yeah, yeah, yeah
And when the drums starts beating that beat
Beating out that beat with the syncopated rhythm
And the (rat, tat, tat, tat....) of the drum, hey

Turn the beat around, turn it upside down
(Love to hear the percussion)
Turn it upside down, turn it all around
(Love to hear the percussion)
Love to hear it, love to hear it
Love to hear it, love to hear it

(Turn the beat around)
Turn the beat around, turn it around
(Love to hear the percussion) Let me hear it
(Turn it upside down) Around and 'round and 'round
(Love to hear the percussion)
(Love to hear it)

(Turn the beat around)
Turn the beat around, turn it around
(Love to hear the percussion)

(Turn it upside down)
Turn it upside down, turn it around and 'round and 'round....
(Love to hear the percussion)
Love to hear it, love to hear it, love to hear it

Talkin' 'bout the beat when you move your feet
(Turn the beat around) When you move your feet
Talkin' 'bout the beat when you move your feet
(Turn in upside down) Turn the beat around
Turn it upside down, turn the beat around
Turn it upside down (turn the beat around)
(Turn in upside down)
(Turn the beat around)
