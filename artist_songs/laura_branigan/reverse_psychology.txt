All the girls are runnin' after you
And I've got to admit that it includes me too
All the girls are puttin' on a show
We all try to catch your eye
But you don't want to know

I've got to be smart
Really got to use my head
I'm gonna pretend I'm not interested

I got a secret weapon
I'm runnin' away
To to make you fall in love with me
I can create the illusion
I'll turn you around
With reverse psychology
Chase me till I catch you...

It really gets you when you are ignored
So I'll make myself a territory unexplored
Now it's my turn to play hard to get
If you try to phone I won't be home
So you don't suspect

I got a secret weapon
I'm runnin' away
To to make you fall in love with me
I can create the illusion
I'll turn you around
With reverse psychology

My heart's telling me what to do
Let you chase me till I catch you

I've got to be smart
Really got to use my head
I'm gonna pretend I'm not interested
