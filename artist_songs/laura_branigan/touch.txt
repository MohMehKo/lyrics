Let me tell you baby what I want to do
There's something that I really got to say
Let me tell you everything that's on my mind
Don't say no I'll tell you anyway
Sometimes when I see you in a crowded room
I really want to kiss you in the dark
I get the strangest feelings coming over me
Frightening sensations of the heart

I want to run but my feet won't go
I wanna move right through the floor
I want to stop but I can't say no
I wanna hear you cry for more

Baby let me touch you
Let me get to know you
Baby let me touch you tonight
Baby let me touch you 
Let me feel your fingertips
Baby let me touch you tonight

I've been attracted to you for so long 
Seems like I've been waiting all my life
And now there's nothing standing in the way of us
We can find what we both really like
I wanna stay with you all night long
I wanna kiss you on the floor
I wanna stop but I can't say no
I wanna hear you cry for more
