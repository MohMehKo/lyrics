Feel it tonight
Rainin' down as cold as ice
The air that we breathe
Is all we share between us
Wearing the scars
Deep inside our desert hearts
Tell me where did it go 
Why did love ever leave us
Now the memories burn in my eyes
As I remember the look of the broken hearted
Never thought I'd be one of their own

We're standing in a shadow forever
Her shadow's in the way of our love
What should have been forgotten
Forever more 
The shadow of what was
Now I'm the one who loves you
But I know we can't hide we can't run
From the shadow she casts on the night
The shadow of love

I want to believe everything that I can't see
But the truth always lies somewhere in between us
I can't help what I feel in the night
Thoughts disturbing the sleep of our innocent lives
Will these dreams ever leave us alone

We're standing in the shadow forever
Her shadow's in the way of our love
What should have been forgotten
Forever more
The shadow of what was
Now I'm the one who loves you
But I know we can't hide we can't run
From the shadow she casts on the night
The shadow of love

I want to know I'll always be
All alone with you
I'm the only one
But long before we ever were
You belonged to her
And she still isn't gone...

Now I'm the one who loves you
But I know we can't hide we can't run

We're standing in the shadow forever
Her shadow's in the way of our love
What should have been forgotten
Forever more
The shadow of what was...
