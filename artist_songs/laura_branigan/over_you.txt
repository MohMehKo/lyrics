I don't lose my breath 
When I hear a step on the stairway 
And my heart doesn't stop 
When I hear a knock at my door
I say to myself it's just some old friend of mine
I don't think for a moment, boy
That you've changed your mind

I'm over you 
I'm finally over you 
Just like you've gotten over me
Just like you did so easily

I'm over you
This time I'm over you 
I really don't care what you do
Just don't tell yourself 
I'm still in love with you 

Things have fallen in place 
And there's hardly a trace of you anywhere 
I've got too much to do 
To be thinking of you coming home 
And I don't expect that your turn will come to cry 
'Cause after all, baby
It was you who said goodbye

I'm over you
This time I'm really over you
Just like you've gotten over me 
Just like you did so easily

I'm over you 
This time I'm really over you 
I really don't care what you do 
Just don't tell yourself
I'm still in love with you 

I'm over you
This time I'm really over you
I don't give a damn what you do 
Just don't tell yourself
I'm still in love with you

This time I'm over you 
I swear I'm really over you
I really don't care what you do 
Just don't tell yourself
I'm still in love with you
