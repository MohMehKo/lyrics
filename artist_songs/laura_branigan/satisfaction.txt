Don't know what you're doin'
But you're doin' somethin' I think I like 
Not sure what I'm feelin'
But it feels like somethin' so right 
The sound of your sigh
The touch of your skin 
Is takin' me places I've never been 
I wanna go there again and again 

'Cause you give me 
Satisfaction
When you're touchin' me 
You start a chain reaction deep inside of me 
Satisfaction
I just never knew that I could feel this way 
Oh babe, I love you

Holdin' you close now
I keep thinkin' of times before 
When nothin' was good enough
I was always left wantin' more 
You took my world, turned it around 
I know you won't be lettin' me down 
'Cause baby, you showed me that love could be found 
When you gave me 

Satisfaction
When you're touchin' me 
You start a chain reaction deep inside of me 
Satisfaction
I just never knew that I could feel this way 
Oh babe, I love you
