If you loved me
I'm sure that you would know
Wouldn't be so easy for you to let me go
If you loved me
You'd put away your pride
And put some love inside
And hold it there forever

If you loved me
If you ever did before
You could find those feelings
And feel them all once more
If you loved me
That love would pull us through
You'd do all you could do
To keep that love together

You had me walkin' on a rainbow
That vanished at my feet
Now that it's over
I see the truth my heart refused to see

If you loved me
The way I loved you from the start
Wouldn't be so easy for you to break my heart
If you loved me
You'd give it one more try
You wouldn't let it die
You'd hold me close forever
If you loved me
If you loved me
If you loved me
Like I love you
