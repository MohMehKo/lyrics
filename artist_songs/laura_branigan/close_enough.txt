I've been waiting all of my life
For you, stranger, you are a light
The light that shines in me
The one who holds the key to my love forever

Close enough
We're close enough to fall in love
We're close enough
Just close enough to make it last
Now there's no turning back
We'll do it together
We're close enough

Open arms reach out to my soul
Hold me closer, in from the cold
And now the time has come
To keep the love we found here forever

Close enough
We're close enough to fall in love
We're close enough
Just close enough to make it last
Now there's no turning back
We'll do it together

And now, now the time has come
To keep the love we found just close enough
We're close enough to fall in love
We're close enough
Just close enough to make it last
Now there's no turning back
We'll do it together
Close enough
