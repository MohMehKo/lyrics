Sitting in La Casolette 
The same place we first met
Trying to talk it out before the fall 
You look the other way 
I struggle for the words to say 
Feels like I'm talking to the wall

I can here them play our song 
But somehow it sounds all wrong 
In a lost romance, dancing a lonely dance

With a heart that doesn't beat as much 
Fingers that have lost their touch
Looking into eyes that just don't see
We dance a little out of time 
I laugh when I feel like crying
Is there anybody here but me 

Two silhouettes in the dark
So close, so far apart 
Going through the motions of the past 
The night is coming to an end 
It's getting harder to pretend 
But still we try to keep this love alive 

With a heart that doesn't beat as much
Fingers that have lost their touch 
Looking into eyes that just don't see
We dance a little out of time
I laugh when I feel like crying
Is there anybody here but me

Never dreamed what we started could end like this
Lovers saying goodbye with a strangers kiss

With a heart that doesn't beat as much 
Fingers that have lost their touch
Looking into eyes that just don't see 
We dance a little out of time
I laugh when I feel like crying 
Is there anybody here but me
