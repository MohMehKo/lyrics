We're all a mystery in this world in which we live
And there's no guarantee that we'll get back what we give
We take a chance on love a dream that lasts forever
We're only flesh and blood
Throwing coins in a wishing well

Only time will tell if a love is true
Only time will tell what a heart is gonna do
Only time will tell who's the dreamer, who's the fool
Only time will tell

We tie the ties that bind with a simple act of faith
No matter how we try we're in the hands of fate
We take the gift of life and give it to each other
We promise you and I a promise that we'll try to keep

Only time will tell if a love is true
Only time will tell what a heart is gonna do
Only time will tell who's the dreamer, who's the fool
Only time will tell

We take the gift of life and give it to each other
We promise you and I a promise that we'll try to keep

Only time will tell if a love is true
Only time will tell what a heart is gonna do
Only time will tell who's the dreamer, who's the fool
Only time will tell
