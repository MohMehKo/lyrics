I don't know who to turn to 
Looks don't look like they used to 
Everything that I try 
Turns from good to goodbye 
I don't know who to turn to
My heart longs for another
One on one with each other 
Deep down inside of me 
It's so, so easy to see 

I want a little tenderness
I need a little honesty
Looking for the open heart
Openin' his arms to me
I wanna fall in love again
To find the love I've never known
I need a little tenderness of my own

I've had just too much of
Of these users using up my love
Deep down inside of me
It's so, so easy to see 

I want a little tenderness
I need a little honesty
Looking for the open heart
Openin' his arms to me
I wanna fall in love again
To find the love I've never known
I need a little tenderness of my own
