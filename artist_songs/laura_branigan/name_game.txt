Come on everybody I say now lets play a game 
I betcha I can make a rhyme, out of anybody's name 
The first letter of the name I treat it like it wasn't there 
But a 'B' or an 'F' or an 'M' will appear
And then I say "Bo" add a 'B' then I say the name 
Then "Bonana Fanna" and "Foe" 
And then I say the name again with an 'F' very plain
then a "Fee Fi" and "Mo" 
And then I say the name again with an 'M' this time
And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme 

O.K. Let's do Tony! 
Tony, Tony Bo-Bony Bonana Fanna Fo-Fony Fee-Fi-Mo Mony
Tony
Now was good Let's try Katie!
Katie Katie Bo-Batie Bonana Fanna Fo-Fatie Fee-Fi- Mo Matie

But if the first two letters are ever the same
You drop them both then say the name
Like Bob, Bob drop the 'B' Bo-Ob 
Or Hugh Hugh drop the 'H' go "Oooo"
Mary, Mary, drop the 'M's Mo-Ary 
That's the only rule that is contrary

O.K. everybody
Now say Bo, Bo! 
Now Tony with a B, Bony!
Now Bonana Fanna Fo, Bonana Fanna Fo!
Then you say the name again with an 'F' very plain, Fony!
Then a Fee Fi and a Mo Fee-Fi and Mo!
Then you say the name with an 'M' this time, Mony!
There isn't any name that I can't rhyme
