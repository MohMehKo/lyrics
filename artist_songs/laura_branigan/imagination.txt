He says that he can read my mind
The power to turn iron into gold
She says she's seen the other side
And knows the place the fire burns all night

There is an answer to the question
So long ago
It's a heartbeat away, everyday
Want to have it, it never goes away

It's in the pocket when you really really like it
When your fantasy becomes reality
Living inside the imagination
It's in the pocket when you really really like it
When your fantasy becomes reality
Living inside the imagination

The magic of the secret door
I can take you down and show you more
It's easy once you know the way
It's harder than the closest thing you are

You've got to walk right through that fire
It will not burn you
And the ones who may look all their life
Won't make it to just burn away

It's in the pocket when you really really like it
When your fantasy becomes reality
Living inside the imagination
It's in the pocket when you really really like it
When your fantasy becomes reality
Living inside the imagination

You've got to walk right through that fire
It will not burn you
And the ones who may look all their life
Won't make it to just burn away
