For the first time in such a long time 
I've been feeling there's some reason 
To hold on through the night 
And for the first time since you broke this heart of mine 
I find myself believin'
It's really going to be alright 
Now you're asking me to let you walk back into my life
Something I can't bring myself to do

'Cause it's been hard enough getting over you 
You know you kept me holdin' on till the end 
Oh it's been hard enough getting over you
I don't think that I could say goodbye again

I could trust you, but it's out of my hands 
I once believed your promises
Believed in every word you said 
I still love you but my heart won't take the chance 
All the pain I've left behind me
Might be waiting for me up ahead
Just remember it was you 
Who walked right out of my life 
Oh you don't know what I've been through 

'Cause it's been hard enough getting over you 
You know you kept me holdin' on til the end 
Oh it's been hard enough getting over you
I don't think that I could say goodbye again 

I made a promise to myself 
And this one I'm not gonna break
I've made it without you
And I'm not about to
Just turn around and make the same mistake 

Oh it's been hard enough getting over you 
You know you kept me holdin' on til the end 
Oh it's been hard enough getting over you
I don't think that I could say goodbye 
I know that I can't say goodbye 
I don't think I could say goodbye again
