I'm caught in a crossfire
With nowhere to run
I'm keepin' my head down
'Cos I've got only one
I'm up on a high wire
With nothin' but air
I'm feelin' so nervous
With so many places to go
But I'm goin' nowhere
I'm ridin' a cyclone
It's twistin' my head
I feel like I'm moving
But my feet feel like lead
I'm drowning in quicksand
It's pullin' me down
I feel so abandoned
When I, I reach for the sky
I still can't get off the ground

Please stay, go away
Can't you see darling that you're drivin' me crazy?
Please stay, go away
Can't you see you're drivin' me crazy?

I'm deep in a forest
I can't find a tree
I'm chained to your heart
But I can't find the key
So show me the way home
I'm too blind to see
My mind's leaning left
While my heart tells me it's right
But it seems wrong to me

Please stay, go away
Can't you see darling that you're drivin' me crazy?
Please stay, go away
Can't you see you're drivin' me crazy?

So you want me to feel
Then you turn like a wheel
Don't you know that I love ya?
Do I have to explain that I'm livin' your pain?
I can't take it again but I don't want it to end

So please stay, go away
Can't you see darling that you're drivin' me crazy?
Please stay, go away
Can't you see darling that you're drivin' me crazy?
Please stay, go away
Can't you see you're drivin' me crazy?
