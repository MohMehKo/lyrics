Ooh, ah 
Come on, come on, come on, come on 

Didn’t I make you feel like you were the only one, yeah 
Didn’t I give you nearly everything 
That a man possibly could 
Honey, you know I did 
And each time I tell myself that 
Well, I think I had enough 
I’m gonna show you, baby 
How a man sure can be tough 
I want you to

And baby, deep down in your heart 
I guess you know that it ain’t right 
Never, never, never hear me when I cry at night 
Yeah, I cry all the time 
But each time I tell myself that

But when you hold me in your arms, baby 
I’ll sing it once again 
Oh, won’t you 

Come on, come on, come on, come on and 
Take it 
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby 
Oh, break it 
Break another little bit of my heart 
Now, baby, baby, baby

Have another little piece of my heart now, baby

Break another little bit of my heart 
Now, baby, baby, baby 
Oh, have a 
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby

Break another little bit of my heart 
Now baby, baby, baby

Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
