Hey honey, take a look at this face 
I’ve been fakin’ this smile all day 
Keepin’ up with this masquerade 
Like a wind me up, a one-man parade 
Can’t you see I’m a different man 
No lie honey, I ain’t no sham 
Lookin’ right here you can see first hand 
It’s the same old me with the same old plan 
I don’t, don’t know if you can see it, baby 
If you heard about me lately 

I’m somebody new, I’m somebody who 
Doesn’t laugh the way I did, I did with you now, honey 
I’m a playin’ me a one more song 
I’m an all night rollin’ stone 
I’m the life of the party ‘cause I don’t wanna go home 
With somebody new 

Remember how I used to be that guy 
Fall for ‘em when they’d bat their eyes 
Grass was greener on the other side 
Sweeter honey when it wasn’t mine 
That’s long, long gone 
Oh, can’t you see it baby 
Have you heard about me lately 

I’m somebody new, I’m somebody who 
Doesn’t laugh the way I did, I did with you now, honey 
I’m a playin’ me a one more song 
I’m an all night rollin’ stone 
I’m the life of the party ‘cause I don’t wanna go home 
With somebody new 

Oh, oh 

I’m somebody new, I’m somebody who 
Doesn’t laugh the way I did, I did with you now, honey 
I’m a playin’ me a one more song 
I’m an all night rollin’ stone 
I’m the life of the party ‘cause I don’t wanna go home 
With somebody new 

With somebody new 
With somebody new 
Nobody but you, ooh 
I’m somebody new
