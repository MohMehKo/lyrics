I ran out, nothing else matters, You and me and the Georgia night,
Look around 'cause it don't get any better, Have you ever felt so alright?
Let's dance, take it slow, Tom Petty on the radio
When we're singing about American Girls like you
When I look in your eyes, all I wanna do is...

Bang bang baby like the 4th of July, A Lightning strike in the midnight sky
Don't give a damn about the summertime blues, All I need is red white and you
Can't let those colors fade, tell me you're gonna stay
American girls making dreams come true
All I need is red white and

You pulling me a little bit closer, Heart beating like a big bass drum
We spinning' on a roller coaster, A "Free Fallin'" into your yum yum
All the bad girls rockin' those cut off jeans, and good old boys driving Big Machines
And you can kiss my ass, can't help but say, it's good to be "Born in the USA"

Bang bang baby like the 4th of July, A Lightning strike in the midnight sky
Don't give a damn about the summertime blues, All I need is red white and you
Can't let those colors fade, tell me you're gonna stay
American girls making dreams come true
All I need is red, white and you

Baby, sweet potato pie
All I need is red, white and
Baby, what we gonna do
And honey, don't give a damn about the summertime blues
All I need is

Bang bang baby like the 4th of July, A Lightning strike in the midnight sky
Don't give a damn about the summertime blues, All I need is red white and you
Can't let those colors fade, tell me you're gonna stay
American girls making dreams come true
All I need is red white and you

Baby
Baby
All I need is red white and
You
Don't give a damn about the summer time blues
All I need is red white and you.
