Janie’s got a gun 
Janie’s got a gun 
Her whole world’s come undone 
From lookin’ straight at the sun 
What did her daddy do 
What did he put you through 

They say when Janie was arrested 
They found him underneath a train 
But man, he had it comin’ 
Now that Janie’s got a gun 
She ain’t never gonna be the same 

Janie’s got a gun 
Janie’s got a gun 
Her dog day just begun 
Now everybody is on the run 
Tell me now it’s untrue 
What did her daddy do 

He jacked a little bitty baby 
The man has got to be insane 
They say the spell that he was under 
The lightnin’ and the thunder 
Knew that someone had to stop the rain 

Run away, run away from the pain, ah 
Run away, run away, run, run away 

You better run away, run away from the pain, yeah 
Run away, run away from the pain, yeah 
Run away, run away, run, run away 

Janie’s got a gun 
Janie’s got a gun 
Janie’s got a gun 
Now everybody is on the run
