Sweet Biloxi to New York City
From that fine red wine of the vine to cheap brown whiskey
Seattle coffey, Memphis blues
Chi-Town wind, Miami cruise
There’s a thousand stories between me and you

Give me some love!

We’re all somebody from somewhere
Some mama, some daddy
Some love in the air
Some big, some little
Some left, some in the middle
Some white, yellow, black or red

Yeah, we’re all somebody from somewhere
(Yeah, we’re all somebody from somewhere)
We’re all somebody from somewhere
(Yeah, we’re all somebody from somewhere)
Yeah!

Hollywood to New Orleans
Filet mignon to black eyed peas

And cornbread damn I love that stuff...

We’re all somebody from somewhere
Some mama, some daddy
Some love in the air
Some big, some little
Some left, some in the middle
Some white, yellow, black or red
