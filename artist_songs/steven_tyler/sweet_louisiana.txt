Where’d you get that voodoo, you ain’t from the Bayou 
Where’d you learn to move like that 
Go ahead and try me, and bring your poison ivy 
Snakin’ in the tall green grass 
Why’d your mama name you Sweet Louisiana
‘Cause you could be the devil’s child 
Glory hallelujah, love the way you do ya 
It’s never goin’ out of style 

Well, it must be so cool to be you 
Makin’ me a fool, yeah, like you do 
You’re like honey to the bees 
Baby, won’t you please 
Sting me with a tease or two 
Sweet Louisiana

Yeah, you’re burnin’ like a fire, sparkin’ like a lighter 
Sugar with a side of sass 
Down and nitty gritty, like you own the city 
Honey, how you so badass 

Well, it must be so cool to be you 
Makin’ me a fool, yeah, like you do 
You’re like honey to the bees 
Baby, won’t you please 
Sting me with a tease or two 
Sweet Louisiana

Sweet Louisiana 

Well, it must be so cool to be you 
Makin’ me a fool, so cruel 
You’re like honey to the bees 
Baby, won’t you please 
Sting me with a tease or two 
Sweet Louisiana 
Sweet Louisiana 
Sweet Louisiana
