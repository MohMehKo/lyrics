Everything is wonderful
Everything is great
And Iâ€™m as free as a bird outside my window pane
I got a fresh new start
It's a brand new day
And I got lots of love to give away

It don't matter if it's raining
Nothing can phase me
I make my own sunshine
And if you think you can break me
Baby you're crazy
I make my own sunshine
I make my own sunshine 

I say hey, let's make a rainbow
Look for a pot of gold
I'll show you how to keep it nice and easy
And even if a cloud comes forming on my love today
There's nothing, no nothing, that could stand in my way

It don't matter if it's raining
Nothing can phase me
I make my own sunshine
And if you think you can break me
Baby you're crazy
I make my own sunshine
I make my own sunshine

It don't matter if it's raining
Nothing can phase me
I make my own sunshine
And if you think you can break me
Baby you're crazy
I make my own sunshine

It don't matter if it's raining
Nothing can phase me
I make my own sunshine
And if you think you can break me
Then baby you're crazy
I make my own sunshine
