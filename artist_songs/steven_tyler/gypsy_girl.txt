I remember the leaves were gone 
And burning embers make for the sweetest songs 
Yeah I can see the two of us living on dreams and dust
Loving you was so unreal that I remember 

[Chorus:]
She was just a gypsy girl 
I was just a chance I wish she’d take 
Got into a lonely world, trying to belong 
Love is like a string of pearls 
While I was waiting for the strand to break 
From a thousand miles away 
Somehow we made it home 
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh 
Just a thousand miles away 
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh 

Wayward travelers’ stars get crossed 
Find out only after we were never lost 
I can see the two of us living on dreams and dust 
Loving you was so unreal that I remember 

[Chorus]

Just a thousand miles away 
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh 
From just a thousand miles away 
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh 
From just a thousand miles away 

[Chorus]

Just a thousand miles away 
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh 
Just a thousand miles away 
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh 
Just a thousand miles away 
Just a thousand miles away
