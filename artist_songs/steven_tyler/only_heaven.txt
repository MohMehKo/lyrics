You're more than a miracle
An answer to a prayer

You heal the broken heart
In need of much repair

Only heaven could've laid you in my arms
Only heaven could've brought us where we are
Girl, it's heaven when I'm lying in your bed
Cause nothing compares to the taste of your lips
Only heaven could ever feel like this
Only heaven

I was down the dusty road
The end nowhere in sight

And I've been dying in the dark
Now I'm living in your light
And you know it feels so right

Only heaven could've laid you in my arms
Only heaven could've brought us where we are
Girl, it's heaven when I'm lying in your bed
Cause nothing compares to the taste of your lips
Only heaven could ever feel like this
Only heaven

Yeah, it ain't nothing but a good thing baby
And there ain't no wonderin' why

Only heaven could've laid you in my arms
Only heaven could've brought us where we are
Girl, it's heaven when I'm lying in your bed
Cause nothing compares to the taste of your lips
Only heaven could ever feel like this
Only heaven
Only heaven
Yeah.. yeah! Only heaven
Only heaven
