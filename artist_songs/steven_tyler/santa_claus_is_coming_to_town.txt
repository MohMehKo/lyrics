You better watch out 
You better not cry 
You better not pout 
I'm telling you why 
Santa Claus is coming to town 

He's making a list, 
Checking it twice; 
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice. 
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping 
He knows when you're awake 
He knows if you've been bad or good 
So be good for goodness sake 

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is coming to town 

He sees you when you're sleeping 
He knows when you're awake 
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake 
Goodness sake 

You better watch out 
You better not cry 
You better not pout 
I'm telling you why 
Santa Claus is coming to town
