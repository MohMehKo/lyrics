I could blame Jesus, I could blame momma 
I could blame Brahma for all the bull that’s in my head 
I could blame Seagram’s for all the whiskey 
And for the tipsy that’s still here on my breath 
And ain’t that why you left 

I’m all alone, tongue tied, and twisted 
Since I said it ain’t you, it’s me 
And girl you cried, but I insisted 
That what could be would never be 
But I was wrong, what’s wrong with me 
I’m my own worst enemy 

I  blame midnight for bad decisions 
And blurry vision for what I didn’t see 
I could blame forever even though I didn’t get it 
I could blame the love even though I up and left it 
I could blame goodbye even though I said it 
And maybe that’s just me 
That’s why you had to leave 

I’m all alone, tongue tied, and twisted 
Since I said it ain’t you, it’s me 
And girl you cried, but I insisted 
That what could be would never be 
But I was wrong, what’s wrong with me 
I’m my own worst enemy

I’m all alone, tongue tied, and twisted 
Since I said it ain’t you, it’s me 
And girl you cried, but I insisted 
That what could be would never be 
But I was wrong, what’s wrong with me 
Now you’re gone and any fool can see
I’m my own worst enemy 
My own worst enemy
