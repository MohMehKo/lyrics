I looked at you, you looked at me,
I knew it then, but you couldn't see it,
And now you've come around.
I walk away, you stay behind,
But I've got the memories to remind me,
Of how you used to...
Hold me so tight, be by my side,
And make it alright...

Love gives, and love takes,
Yeah it'll keep you up in the middle of night
And catch you when you're falling
Love is, what love makes,
If you let it go it'll always come back,
When it hears you calling,
LOVE LIVES...

I know you're there, you always were,
There'll be an end to all this hurting,
But how many tears will fall?
Before you're back into my arms
So I can tell you I've been dying
Without you...
Too many nights, are passing us by,
But we'll make it by, yeah..

Love gives, and love takes,
Yeah it'll keep you up in the middle of night
And catch you when you're falling
Love is, what love makes,
If you let it go it'll always come back,
When it hears you calling.
Love lifts you up and lets you fly
And makes you think you'll never die,
And it's just like livin' in heaven
And you'll never ever wanna come down...

'Cause love is, what love makes,
And true love, never breaks.

'Cause Love gives, and love takes,
It'll keep you up in the middle of night,
And catch you when you're falling
Love is, what love makes,
If you let it go it'll always come back,
When it hears you...

Love gives, and love takes,
Yeah it'll keep you up in the middle of night.
And catch you when you're falling
Love is, what love makes,
Yeah if you let it go it'll always come back,
When it hears you calling,
LOVE LIVES...

LOVE LIVES...
