Yeah, you wanna know me better 
What’d you think I was in it for 
I ain’t the kind of guy just wanna walk you to your door 

I squeeze some Georgia peaches 
But I know you got the juice 
When the devil greets us, girl what’s your excuse 

You say left and I say right 
You say go to bed, I’m stayin’ up all night 
Yeah, straight jack, straight black 
In fact, you’re gonna get what you see 
The good, the bad, the ugly and me 

I come and get, get, get, it baby 
For me and the whiskey’s gone 
You ain’t no Tina Turner, get your Nutbush City on 

Yeah, you say left, I say right 
You say go to bed and I stay up all night 
Straight jack, straight black 
In fact, you’re gonna get what you see 
The good, the bad, the ugly and me 

There ain’t no need to sugar coat it 
Take the bitter with the sweet 
While you’re preachin’ to the choir 
I’ll be dancin’ in the street, street, street, street 

I say left, you say right 
You say go to bed and I stay up all night 
Straight jack, straight black 
In fact, you’re gonna get what you see 
Straight jack, straight black 
In fact, you’re gonna get all three 
The good, the bad, the ugly and me
