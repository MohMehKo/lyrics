I never knew I could fly,
But something is taking me higher than ever,
Like something inside is lifting me up
Until I'm touching heaven.
No matter what the world may bring,
It all comes down to one thing.

Have you ever been in love?
Have you ever noticed how 
The sky never seemed so blue,
The whole world's in time with you.
Have you ever known that someone
Is gonna be the one,
And no matter what you do,
The sun still shines on you.
Like an angel from above,
Have you ever been in love?

And if he takes my hand,
I'm carried away with the force of the river.
And when there are mountains ahead,
They're easy to face if we climb them together.
Whatever dreams the night may bring,
It all comes down to one thing.

Is gonna be the one.
And no matter what you do,
The sun still shines on you.
Like an angel from above,
Have you ever been in love?

No matter what you do, yeah.
