When you're down
And the worse just gets the better of you
I'll come nothing above you, my love

'Cause I'm on a ride
And you got me caught up in this landslide
You make me wanna spread my wings and fly

Oh baby, you make me stronger
Baby, you make me weak
Ain't nobody gonna keep you out of my reach

Baby, anywhere you are
No, it don't matter how far
I'm going any which way but without you

And if heaven ever falls
Should I be rich or lose it all
I'll take it any which way but without you, baby

Don't you know it?
Ain't no feeling in this world that's better than
When I'm the skin under your hands

I'll be coming running
If you just call out my name, I'm ready
For whatever lies ahead

Oh baby, you make me stronger
Baby, you make me weak
But ain't nobody gonna keep you out of my reach

Baby, anywhere you are
No, it don't matter how far
I'm going any which way but without you

And if heaven ever falls
Should I be rich or lose it all
I'll take it any which way but without you

I wanna show you
Oh, there ain't no doubt about it
The faith you give to me

Oh, haven't I told you?
Maybe you're all I breathe
I'll be your light when darkness falls
Make it over any wall

Any which way but without you
And if heaven ever falls
Should I be rich or lose it all
Any which way but without you, baby

Any which way but without you
Should I be rich or lose it all
Any which way but without you
Without you, baby, yeah, yeah
