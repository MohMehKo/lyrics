What I gotta do
What I gotta do to get through to you?
Baby can you feel me?
It hurts for me to think about leaving you,
Tell me what I gotta do.

Six months ago, we reconnect with so much passion
Yo what happened, I can't imagine
I was feeling you, you were feeling me, so much affection
Thought we were moving in the right direction.

I wanted you to be my man
Now I just don't understand
What the hell has gotten into you!

You lie around watching TV while I am cookin',
Wearing some lingerie but you ain't lookin'.
Wait up for you to come to bed and lit some candles
To get it going but you don't notice.

[chorus]

The nights we shared, the laughs we had
What happened to the man that used to put me first?
How can we take it back to yesterday?
Cuz damn I really wanna stay, what I gotta do?

[chorus]
