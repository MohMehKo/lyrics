You assume I'm weak, you assume I'm frail
But your presumptions won't prevail
I'm made of more than what you see
Tell me to twist, tell me to bend
But I won't break just to fit in
Just shut your mouth and listen up
I was so naive
To let you have control of me
But now that I believe in me, I know
Oh

You're wrong, and I'm strong
Unafraid I'm moving on
Cause I'm free to be me
Nobody tells me who to be
Cause you're wrong, and I'm strong
Un-afraid I'm moving on
Cause I'm free, to be me
Nobody tells me who to be
Yeah

I'm on the outside looking in
No longer do I pretend,
To be something that I'm not
I don't run, and I don't hide behind a comfort in disguise
What you see is what you get
I was so naive
To let you have control of me
But now that I believe in me, I know
Oh

Cause you're wrong, and I'm strong
Unafraid I'm moving on
Cause I'm free to be me
Nobody tells me who to be
Cause you're wrong, and I'm strong
Un-afraid I'm moving on
Cause I'm free, to be me
Nobody tells me who to be
Yeah

I wouldn't change a thing
Cause life is how you grow
You live, you learn, and then you know

Cause you're wrong, and I'm strong
Unafraid I'm moving on
Cause I'm free to be me
Nobody tells me who to be
Cause you're wrong, and I'm strong
Un-afraid I'm moving on
Cause I'm free, to be me
Nobody tells me who to be
Cause you're wrong, and I'm strong
Unafraid I'm moving on
Cause I'm free to be me
Nobody tells me who to be
Cause you're wrong, and I'm strong
Unafraid I'm moving on
Cause I'm free to be me
Nobody tells me who to be
Yeah
