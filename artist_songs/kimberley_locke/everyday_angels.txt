Today woke up thinking it was my day
Heard you say thing's don't ever go your way

Saw my reflection just passing by
Homeless man looking through my eyes
Held up a sign, said what's inside
Because of him I realize

Everyday angels, oh, sometimes I don't see
When I'm all caught up in stupid things
They show me what it means

Everyday angels, oh, teach me how to fly
'Cause we only get one chance to make
The most of our lives

I pray for a miracle to come my way
Saw her face, she was wishing she was in my place

Then I caught my reflection just passing by
A little girl with her arms held high
Holding a sign that said 'What's inside?'
Because of her I realize

Everyday angels, oh, sometimes I don't see
When I'm all caught up in stupid things
They show me what it means

Everyday angels, oh, teach me how to fly
'Cause we only get one chance to make
The most of our lives

Looking at my life and what my purpose is
Too busy in his face to notice tears upon your face
Now I realize what I gotta do
Everyday find a way to be an angel too

Everyday angels, oh, sometimes I don't see
When I'm all caught up in stupid things
They show me what it means

Everyday angels, oh, teach me how to fly
'Cause we only get one chance to make
The most of our lives

Everyday angels, oh, sometimes I don't see
When I'm all caught up in stupid things
They show me what it means

Everyday angels, oh, teach me how to fly
'Cause we only get one chance to make
The most of our lives

I only get one chance
To spread my wings and fly
Everyday, everyday angels
Everyday, everyday angels

Don't let 'em pass you by
When they look into your eyes
Lend a helping hand
And make a difference in their lives

Everyday, everyday angels
Everyday, everyday angels

It only takes one person
(Everyday, everyday angels)
To make a difference in his life
(Everyday, everyday angels)

Everyday, everyday angels
Everyday, everyday angels
Everyday, everyday angels
