So long you were wrong
This is it, I'm moving on
It's my life, can't stop me now
I'm through with you, I see the light
It feels so right

First thing I'm gonna do now that I'm over you
Is everything you told me I couldn't do

I'm gonna cut my hair
I'm gonna call my girls
Hit the club, I'm doing it tonight, yeah

I'm gonna wear that skirt
I'm staying out all night
If I want, I'm doing it tonight, yeah

So long I was scared
Never thought I'd make it alone
But look at me now

I found the real me inside
The woman that you tried to deny
But you won't this time

First thing I'm gonna do now that I'm over you
Is everything you told me I couldn't do

I'm gonna cut my hair
I'm gonna call my girls
Hit the club, I'm doing it tonight, yeah

I'm gonna wear that skirt
I'm staying out all night
If I want, I'm doing it tonight, yeah

And it feels so good to be myself again
Doing all the crazy things
That you know we should have did
So baby, don't be mad
If you see me doing my thing without you, yeah, yeah

I'm gonna cut my hair
I'm gonna call my girls
Hit the club, I'm doing it tonight, yeah

I'm gonna wear that skirt
I'm staying out all night
If I want, I'm doing it tonight, yeah

I'm gonna cut my hair
I'm gonna call my girls
Hit the club, I'm doing it tonight, yeah

I'm gonna wear that skirt
I'm staying out all night
If I want, I'm doing it tonight, yeah

Can't stop me now
Now that I'm over you

First thing I'm gonna do, yeah
