It's hard, to believe
We weren't meant to be
And all good things end eventually
But here i am, walking away
And you're down on your knees begging me please baby stay
Well no can do
'Cause boy you were un-true
The only rule, there's no exception to
Three's a crowd
So where does that leave you now
That's what you get for living now
Remember

Coulda been right, coulda been cool
Coulda been the best thing since high school 
Coulda been right, coulda been free
Coulda been everything, to me
Coulda been real, coulda been hot
Coulda been the one who hits my spot, 
But you're not and all you got is something that coulda been
But you're not and all you got is something that coulda been

I use to think i couldn't live without us together
But boy look at me now
I got my whole, whole life and all my dreams
So as you wave goodbye to me, remember

Coulda been right, coulda been cool
Coulda been the best thing since high school 
Coulda been right, coulda been free
Coulda been everything, to me
Coulda been real, coulda been hot
Coulda been the one who hits my spot, 
But you're not and all you got is something that coulda been
But you're not and all you got is something that coulda been

Someday you'll see me walking down the street, 
Looking all competent and complete.
Wondering if you made a mistake, 
Throw it away too soon. 
I'll wave and blow you a kiss, 
And say it's cool running into you like this.
How you doing, how many kids, 
Do you ever look back, 
And wish that you could turn, 
Turn back time
And make me change my mind
But you didn't so, lets get on with letting go
Almost doesn't count you know
So remember, remember, 
So remember, remember

Coulda been right, coulda been cool
Coulda been the best thing since high school 
Coulda been right, coulda been free
Coulda been everything
Coulda been real, coulda been hot
Coulda been the one who hits my spot, 
But you're not and all you got is something that coulda been

Coulda been

Coulda been right, coulda been cool
Coulda been the been thing since high school
Coulda been right, coulda been free
Coulda been everything
Coulda been real, coulda been hot
Coulda been the one who hits my spot, 
But you're not and all you got is something
But you're not and all you got is something
But you're not and all you got is something
That coulda been
