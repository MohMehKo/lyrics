Ooh Ooh Ooh
Never knew I was existing
Getting by from sun to sun
Missing out on what my life 
Someday would become
There were friends and there were lovers
There were times I really cared
And every now and then
Someone I thought 
I always wanted there??
I laughed and dreamed
I moved to my heartbeat

I never lived before
Never felt before
Never breathed 
Until I breathed the same air as you
I never gave before
Always wanted more
And with one touch I knew I'd never loved 
Before....you

It's like I never saw a sunrise
Til I woke up by your side
Like I didn't see the moon until
I saw it in your eyes
I never kissed 
Until your lips touched mine

I never lived before
Never felt before
Never breathed 
Until I breathed the same air as you
I never gave before
Always wanted more
And with one touch I knew I'd never loved 
Before

Before you there was no music
No rhythm and no rhyme
Now life is like a symphony
And my heart is alive

I never lived before
Never felt before
Never breathed 
Until I breathed the same air as you
I never gave before
I always wanted more
And with one touch I knew I'd never loved 
Before....You

Oh oh oh 
One touch I knew
I never loved before
