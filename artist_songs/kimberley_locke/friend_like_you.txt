Lookin' back in the past
Remember when we used to be so close
But now who knows

I can't believe that I could be
So unaware of your vindictive ways
The games you play

You violated all the trust we had
When you were doin' my man

Who needs an enemy
When I've got a friend like you?
After all that we've been through
You turned on me, I don't need you

Who needs an enemy
When I've got a friend like you?
What they're sayin' must be true
You turned on me, I don't need you

I was there when you were down
I let you in, I gave you all I had
Wish I could take it back

Now I see, what you're about
You run your mouth
All you care about's yourself
You're somethin' else

You violated all the trust we had
With all the lies that you spread

Who needs an enemy
When I've got a friend like you?
After all that we've been through
You turned on me, I don't need you

Who needs an enemy
When I've got a friend like you?
What they're sayin' must be true
You turned on me, I don't need you

Get a life, you're outta line
'Cuz all you do is live through mine
Got a little too much time on your hands

I never thought that it would get to be this way
You can't even look me in my face

Who needs an enemy
When I've got a friend like you?
After all that we've been through
You turned on me, I don't need you

Who needs an enemy
When I've got a friend like you?
What they're sayin' must be true
You turned on me, I don't need you

Who needs an enemy
When I've got a friend like you?
After all that we've been through
You turned on me, I don't need you

Who needs an enemy
When I've got a friend like you?
What they're sayin' must be true
You turned on me, I don't need you
