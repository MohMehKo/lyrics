Sorry for what I forgot to say
But you know how words get in the way baby, lately
Wasn't strong enough to cut right through
All the red tape between me and you, baby
Time escapes me

What's it gonna take to shake these blues
Pushing through the clouds just to get to you
Can't hold back the storm that's blowing through, yeah

I feel a change, babe, washing over me
I feel the rains, babe, coming to set me free
It's a one way track, ain't coming back
This train's about to leave
I feel a change coming over me

Never noticed that it's kind of strange
Same story but a different day lately, oh baby
Gotta get up, gotta change the scene
Gotta rip this page from the magazine

(I feel a change, babe) Change washing over me
(I feel the rains, babe) I feel the rains, yeah, coming to set me free
It's a one way track, I ain't ever coming back
(This train's about to leave) This train's about to leave, yeah
I feel a change coming over me, yeah

I ain't trying to be difficult, no no
I ain't trying to be mean
I just gotta do right now
What's best for me, oh

(I feel a change, babe) Something's changing, baby, deep inside of me
(I feel the rains, babe) I feel the rains coming down to set me free
(It's a one way track) I ain't ever going back
(This train's about to leave) If you wanna go, baby, this train's gonna leave
(I feel a change) There's a change coming over me, yeah

Oh, yeah
I feel a, I feel a change coming over me
Rain washing down on me
Coming to set me free, baby
I feel a change, yeah
I feel a change, yeah
A one way track
I ain't never coming back
This train's about to leave, baby
I feel a change, yeah
