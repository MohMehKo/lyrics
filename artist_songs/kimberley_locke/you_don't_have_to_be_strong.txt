Ooh, yeah, yeah
Listen to me baby

You've always been there for me
I have a shoulder to cry on
Whenever I call you come running
Something I can rely on

I can see, I can see the pain in your eyes
You think a man's supposed to hide
What he's feeling inside but you're wrong

You don't have to be strong for me
You don't have to be so proud with me
You don't have to be a rock
Standing out there like an island all alone
You don't have to be strong

Ain't gonna think less of you, baby
And you know that's for sure
If the tears roll down your cheek
It'll only make me love you more

You're still a man, still my man, a man in my eyes
Let me be there for you
Like you've been there for me, all along

You don't have to be strong for me
You don't have to be so proud with me
You don't have to be a rock
Standing out there like an island all alone
You don't have to be strong, no, you don't

I know you feel
The weight of the world on your shoulders
So come over here
And, baby, just let me hold you, let me hold you

You don't have to be strong for me
You don't have to be such a proud man with me
You can let it all out
That's why I'm here that's what this love is all about

You don't have to be strong, no, no, no for me
You don't have to be so proud with me
You don't have to be a rock

Standing out there like an island all alone
You don't have to be strong
Just let me be strong for you this time
