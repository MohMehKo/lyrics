Ohhhhh yeaaa
Mmmmmmmmmmmmm

Somewhere over the rainbow,
Way up high.
There's a land that i've heard of,
Once in a lullaby.

Somewhere over the rainbow,
Skies are blue.
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.

Someday i wish upon a star, (someday i wish upon a star)
Where the clouds are far far far behind me
(and wake up where the clouds are far behinnnd me)
Wherrrreeee.

All my troubles melt like lemondrops.
Way above the chimney tops, (way above the chimney tops) 
That is where you will finnnnnnddddd meeeee.

Somewhere over the rainbow,
Bluebirds fly.
If birds can fly over over the rainbow,
Then why, then why can'tttttt IIIIIIIIIIII!
(bids fly high, why can't I)
Ohh wahy ohhh why ohhh why ohhhhh
(if birds fly high, why can't I)
If every little bluebirds fly (if every bird fly) 
Over the rainbow, 
Somebody tell me why, somebody tell me
(if bids fly high, why can't I) 
Whyyyyyyyyy cannnn't I.
