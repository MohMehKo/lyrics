There's a shadow in my mind,
that I'm tryin' to leave behind
but it can't get me down.
There are clouds in the sky,
still, the sun is in my eyes
whenever you're around.

It's all good,
like I could
finally be the one who gets to win.
It's so real,
how I feel
ever since I let you in.

Does it get any better than this?
We're into something beautiful.
Bein' with you's as good as it gets.
It doesn't get any better...

It's as if,
the night is ours.
I can see a billion stars
that were never there before.
Like there's something in the air
I can feel it everywhere,
I just want more and more.

It's all good,
like I could
fly up to the moon and back again.
It's so real,
how I feel,
never want it all to end.

Does it get any better than this?
We're into something beautiful.
Bein' with you's as good as it gets.
It doesn't get any better...

Standin' here in my shoes,
I feel like I can't lose,
no, not this time.
O-o-oh,
the worst is in the past,
we save the best for last
when now I find
everything is just fine!

Everything is just fine!

Does it get any better than this?
We're into something beautiful.
Bein' with you's as good as it gets.
It doesn't get any better than this!

No, no, no!

Something beautiful!

As good as it gets!

Baby, you and me.

It doesn't get any better!

We're into something beautiful!
