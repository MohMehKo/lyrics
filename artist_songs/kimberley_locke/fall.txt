Oh, look, there you go again
Putting on that smile again
Even though I know you've had a bad day

You're doing this and doing that
Always putting yourself last
A whole lot of give and not enough take
But you can only be strong so long before you break

So fall, go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine
I'll catch you every time you

Fall, go on and lose it all
Every doubt, every fear
Every worry, every tear
I'm right here, baby, fall

Forget about the world tonight
All that's wrong and all that's right
Lay your head on my shoulder, let it fade away, yeah
And if you want to let go, baby it's okay

So fall, go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine
I'll catch you every time you

Fall, go on and lose it all
Every doubt, every fear
Every worry, every tear
I'm right here, baby, fall

Oh, hold on, hold on
Hold on to me

Fall, go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine
I'll catch you every time you

Fall, go on and lose it all
Every doubt, every fear
Every worry, every tear
I'm right here, baby, baby, baby fall
