I could pretend to love you,
And be someone else for awhile.
Make you believe your the one that i want,
Give you my heart in diguise,
I could be all you wanted
Make all your dreams come true, yeah
Surrender my love
At the feet of your will
And live out your fantasy for you,

And you would be happy,
And I'd make you smile
And I'd go on living a lie,

But do you really want,
To give your life to,
Thinking you've found true love,
When it hasn't found you?

Do you really want,

I could make you a promise,
And be all you want me to be.
Give you my hand as we walk down the aisle
So you could live happily.

Cause this is not
What i had planned
I hoped one day that you will understand,
If i could take 
This heart i broke
And say i love you honey, 
If i could.

But do you really want
To give your life to,
Thinking you've found true love,
When it hasn't found you?

I could be the one to hold you,
And i could be the one you need,
But i could never be the one 
To give you everything.
