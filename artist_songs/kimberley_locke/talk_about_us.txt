Come home late at night
And some thing's on your mind
You say that you're okay
But it feels like you're pushin' away

I know just what to do
To show you I'm here for you
So, come to me, just let it out
I'll ease your mind of any doubt

When it feels like the world is upside down
I'm your girl through the sun and the rain
You're always there for me
When things are turned around
So that's why I say

Let's talk about us
Baby, tell me what's goin' on
So we can move on

Let's talk about us
Ain't no use in keepin' it inside
Don't you know by now I know
When something ain't right?

Let's go back to when love was free
Don't make it harder than it has to be
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause nothin' matters but you and me

I know you made a sacrifice
So we could start a brand new life
You would never say that you're afraid
But I see it written on your face

If we really sync together now
There's nothing that we can't figure out
Here we are, don't throw this moment away
That's what I gotta say

When it feels like the world is upside down
I'm your girl through the sun and the rain
You're always there for me
When things are turned around
That's why I say

Let's talk about us
Tell me what's goin' on
So we can move on

Let's talk about us
Ain't no use in keepin' it inside
See, I know if something ain't right

Let's go back to when love was free
Don't make it harder than it has to be
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause nothin' matters but you and me

Let's talk about trust
Let's talk about the best of us
Let's talk about me being down for you
Whenever you need me

Let's talk about love
Let's talk about makin' up
'Cause I'm your girl
And I'm here to stay for always

Let's talk about us
So we can move on
Let's talk about us
Ain't no use to keep it inside
See, I know if something ain't right

Let's go back to when love was free
Don't make it harder than it has to be
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause nothin' matters but you and me

Let's talk about us
So we can move on
Let's talk about us
Let's talk about it, baby
Let's talk about it, baby

Let's go back to when love was free
Don't make it harder than it has to be
