I have always been the one who could see a mile away
I can read them all just like a book
When friends would ask me for advice, I'd be the first to say
Don't be blind, take a good hard look

But now that I'm the one
Who is wonderin' what's been goin' on
Now that I'm the one
Who can tell there's somethin' wrong

I don't wanna know
If you don't love me anymore
I don't wanna know
If love has closed the door

I don't wanna hear
What you might say to me tonight
Don't wanna face my fear
If I gotta let you go

I don't wanna know
(I don't wanna know)
I don't wanna know
(I don't wanna know)

I remember kisses, then the flowers in the rain
Feeling safe when I was in your arms
Something in the way you touched is givin' it away
How did we drift so far apart?

If it's really true when you're loving me, it's just a lie
If it's really time that we have to say goodbye

Then I don't wanna know
If you don't love me anymore
I don't wanna know
If love has closed the door

I don't wanna hear
What you might say to me tonight
Don't wanna face my fear
If I gotta let you go
I don't wanna know

Maybe it was somethin' I said to you
Maybe it was somethin' I didn't do
I don't know

There were times that we didn't see eye to eye
Lord knows I gave it a real good try
Maybe it's got nothin' to do with me at all

I don't wanna know
If you don't love me anymore
I don't wanna know
If love has closed the door

I don't wanna hear
What you might say to me tonight
Don't wanna face my fear
If I gotta let you go

I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
