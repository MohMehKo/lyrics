I can still remember how I
Felt that day
Like the wind was taken out
From under me
It sent me head first back 
Down to earth
Looking up at all my pain and hurt

Just when I thought all my
Hope was gone
Felt you there right by my side
Promising i'd never fall again

And lifting me into the sky
Shattered memories and
Broken wings
Love had left me with
Wounded dreams
You came in my life and now i can fly
My heart was heavy it weighed
Me down
I couldn't see it the higher ground
You came in my life and now i can fly

There's something different in
The air around me
I can't explain it but your lovin'
Set me free
Now my head is all up in the clouds
There ain't a thing that can bring
Me down

Just when I thought all my hope 
Was gone
Felt you there right by my side
Promising i'd never fall again
And lifting me into the sky

Shattered memories and 
Broken wings
Love had left me with
Wounded dreams
You came in my life and now i can fly
My heart was heavy it weighed
Me down
I couldn't see it the higher ground
You came in my life and now i can fly

When you're lying next to me
I see a future in your eyes
I took a chance on letting you in
And i was right, told the past
Goodbye
And now i can fly
