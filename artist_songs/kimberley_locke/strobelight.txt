Post, feet, stop, motion
move your body lets go
Stimulation overload

Everyday with you is like a Friday night.
Take me where I leave the world behind.
I wanna go to the slow motion zone
I wanna feel the floor and Im loosing control
Won't you come and take me to paradise?

Strobelight
Takes me so high
When I'm with you, Im on Cloud 9
Out on the floor
Strobelight
Flash in my eye
When I'm with you, I know soul ties
My time for more.

You're my sweet escape from everything
You've got me sprung cause you satisfy my needs
I wanna go to the slow motion zone
I wanna feel the floor and Im loosing control
Won't you come and take me baby please?

Strobelight
Takes me so high
When I'm with you, Im on Cloud 9
Out on the floor
Strobelight
Flash in my eye
When I'm with you, I know soul ties
My time for more.

You can call me crazy,
but I'm just having the time of my life...right now
We can feel the rythm,
And the dj's keeping it hard, nothing can stop us right now

Post, feet, stop, motion, move your body lets go
Stimulation overload

Strobelight
Takes me so high
When I'm with you, Im on Cloud 9
Out on the floor
Strobelight
Flash in my eye
When I'm with you, I know soul ties
My time for more.
