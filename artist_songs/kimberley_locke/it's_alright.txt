She was so attractive
Her parents overprotective
Met a little boy with a Lexus
They made out on a mattress

She thought he loved her
But now he don't even bother
Had a little baby named Donna
But Donna don't ain't got no father

17 can't occur
All they saw was a dumb young girl
Spend a little dough, talk a little game
She was young and she didn't know
All they play on the radio, all they show in the video
How could she say no?

It's alright, it's okay, you don't have to explain a thing
I know what's it like, 
Looking for someone to love.
It's okay, it's alright. 
You can come and stay with me tonight. 
You can cry on my shoulder, 
Just come on over

It's alright, It's okay
It's allllright

Now Brenda lived in Michigan, always seemed a little different
Met another girl after college, then came out of the closet
All the friends she had before, they don't come around no more
She feels so abandonded, won't even leave her apartment

It's alright, it's the same
Just want to be like everbody else
Can't go home, what will the say
She ran away
She was young and innocent, she gave in to prejudice
No one came and heard a thing
No one heard a thing

It's alright, it's okay, you don't have to explain a thing
I know what's it like, 
Looking for someone to love.
It's okay, it's alright. 
You can come and stay with me tonight. 
You can cry on my shoulder, 
Just come on over

It's alright, It's okay
It's alright
It's okay, it's alright.

It's okay if you want stay, it's alright if you want to go
Arms are open wide, I just gotta let you know
No matter what they say, I'm going to stay right by you side
I'll be there for you, everything is going to be alright
Alright

It's alright, it's okay, you don't have to explain a thing
I know what's it like, 
Looking for someone to love.
It's okay, it's alright. 
You can come and stay with me tonight. 
You can cry on my shoulder, 
Just come on over

It's alright, It's okay
I know what it's like looking for someone to love
It's alright, it's okay
You can cry on my shoulder
