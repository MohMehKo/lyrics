You know, something's happened
It ain't the same

Started out as friends, no doubt we'd be to the very end
One thing lead to another
Then we fell in love with each other 
Oh how beautiful things were between us back then
It was so sweet,
Use to send roses to my job in the middle of the week
One thing lead to another
Now we hardly speak to each other
It's so strange, soooo strange

You've changed. 
I miss the conversations,
Miss the stimulations, 
Miss communicating. 
You've changed. 
Miss the lovey-dovey, 
Feeling way you hugged me,
Knowing you still love me
So don't change. 
Don't change, noooo

Use to make love for hours,
Turn right around and take long hot showers
But now we just go through the motions
What's love if there's no emotion
Just ain't the same, ain't the same
The beautiful thing that we had
Use to be good, now it hurts me so bad
Now when I look in your eyes, 
All I see is emptiness inside
You can't disguise, can't deny

You've changed. 
I miss the conversations,
Miss the stimulations, 
Miss communicating. 
You've changed. 
Miss the lovey-dovey, 
Feeling way you hugged me,
Knowing you still love me
So don't change. 
Don't change, noooo

You've changed
Used to go everywhere
Where the was one there was always the other
Now you're out all night, 
Act like we ain't even together
Use to call every hour on the hour, 
Didn't need no excuse
If you want to get it right, keep it tight, 
Make it alright, 
Baby, please don't change

Miss the conversations,
Miss the stimulations, 
Miss communicating. 
You've changed. 
Miss the lovey-dovey, 

You've changed. 
I miss the conversations,
Miss the conversations,
Miss the stimulations, 
Miss communicating. 
You've changed. 
Miss the lovey-dovey, 
Feeling way you hugged me,
Knowing you still love me
So don't change. 
Don't change, noooo
