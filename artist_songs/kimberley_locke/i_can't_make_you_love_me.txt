Turn down the lights 
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices
Inside my head

Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close,
Dont patronize

Dont patronize me

I cant make you love me
If you dont
You cant make your heart feel something it wont
Here in the dark
in these final hours
I will lay down my heart
And Ill feel the power 
but you wont
No, you wont
Cause I cant make you love me
If you dont

Ill close my eyes
then I wont see
The love you dont feel
when your holding me

Morning will come
and Ill do whats right
Just give me til then
to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

I cant make you love me
If you dont
You cant make your heart feel something it wont
Here in the dark
in these final hours
I will lay down my heart
And Ill feel the power 
but you wont
No, you wont
Cause I cant make you love me
If you dont
