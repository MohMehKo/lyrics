This week was crazy, so glad it's through
Ready to party all night long
Me and my besties, we in this spot
DJ keep spinning 'cause that's my song
I noticed you across the room
You wanna know just how I do
Well I'm not your average kinda girl
Think you can hang? Then you gotta

Rock with it, roll with it
Lose all control with it
Rock with it, rock with it
Relax and let it go

Dance 'til you can't dance no more
Just rock, yeah yeah, just rock, yeah yeah
Hey, work your body, hit the floor
Just rock, yeah yeah, just rock
You wanna be bae, just play by the rules
Follow my lead, keep up, boy, don't kill the mood
Hey, dance 'til you can't dance no more
Just rock, yeah yeah, just rock, yeah yeah
Oh, hey, hey

I feel like money, 100 grand
Won't you come over? Take my hand
Lost in the rhythm, it call my name
Can't ignore it, the beat's insane
Don't worry 'bout who's in the crowd
We're in the spotlight, let's show out
'Cause I'm not your average kinda girl
Think you can hang? Then you gotta

Rock with it, roll with it
Lose all control with it
Rock with it, rock with it
Relax and let it go

Dance 'til you can't dance no more
Just rock, yeah yeah, just rock, yeah yeah
Hey, work your body, hit the floor
Just rock, yeah yeah, just rock
You wanna be bae, just play by the rules
Follow my lead, keep up, boy, don't kill the mood
Hey, dance 'til you can't dance no more
Just rock, yeah yeah, just rock, yeah yeah
Oh

We gonna dance 'til we can't no more, dance 'til we can't no more
Party's going up and the speakers on loud
We gonna dance 'til we can't no more, dance 'til we can't no more

Dance 'til you can't dance no more
Just rock, yeah yeah, just rock, yeah yeah
Hey, work your body, hit the floor
Just rock, yeah yeah, just rock
You wanna be bae, just play by the rules
Follow my lead, keep up, boy, don't kill the mood
Hey, dance 'til you can't dance no more
Just rock, yeah yeah, just rock, yeah yeah
