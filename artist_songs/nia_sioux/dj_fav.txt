I can't stop
I'm hypnotized
All eyes are fixed on you
Feel it throbbing
Through the speakers
Turn it up, up, up, up!

I can't stop climbing up your chart
My heart beats double time for you
Feel it s-skippin'
Drop the needle
Turn it up, up, up, up, yeah!

Turn me round
Turn me round
I wanna dance all night with you
Turn me round
Turn me round
DJ, what you gonna do?

And you push play
Got me dancing
I'm so crazy
I'm spinnin' like a CD
And it's okay
'Cause I'm dancin' all night long

I'm the DJ's favorite song

Play it all night long
You won't forget
I'm the DJ's favorite song
Play it all night long
You won't forget me
I'm the DJ's favorite song

I won't flop
I'm too confident
Not another one-hit wonder
Cut the record
A Capella
Turn it up, up, up, up, yeah!

Turn me round
Turn me round
I wanna dance all night with you
Turn me round
Turn me round
DJ what you gonna do?

And you push play
Got me dancing
I'm so crazy
I'm spinnin' like a CD
And it's okay
'Cause I'm dancin' all night long

Play it all night long
You won't forget
I'm the DJ's favorite song
Play it all night long
You won't forget me
I'm the DJ's favorite song

I'm the girl
You'll never forget
I get stuck in your head
So you can't forget when you wear me out
Like an old cassette

And you push play
Got me dancing
I'm so crazy
I'm spinnin' like a CD
And it's okay
'Cause I'm dancin' all night long

I'm the DJ's favorite song
I'm the DJ's favorite song
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm goin' real crazy
I'm the DJ's favorite song

Play it all night long
You won't forget
I'm the DJ's favorite song
Play it all night long
You won't forget me
I'm the DJ's favorite song
