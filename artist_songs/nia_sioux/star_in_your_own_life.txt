Getting ready in the mirror
Today will be epic
Gotta live the way you wanna
So you don't regret it

Life is a book and you write it
Your happiness is on you
No matter what just keep at it
And push through

Cause you're fearless
Flawless
You got this
So go do it (do it)
Aye, get to it (to it)
Aye

Whoever you choose to be own it
It's your drum and it's your beat
Show it off for the world to see
Be a star in your own life
Be a star in your own life
You are a star in your own life

Everybody has a dream that
They need to follow
All you got to do is believe
The world is ours

Cause life is a book and you write it
Your happiness is on you
No matter what just keep at it
And push through

Cause you're fearless
Flawless
You got this
So go do it, do it
Aye, get to it, to it
Aye

Whoever you choose to be own it
It's your drum and it's your beat
Show it off for the world to see
Be a star in your own life
Be a star in your own life
You are a star in your own life

If life is a runway
Walk it out
Don't-don't be afraid to put it down

If life is a dance
You better own it
Never have no fear
Don't ever show it

'Cuz we all got that thing
That really makes us shine
And who you are is just fine

Whoever you choose to be own it
It's your drum and it's your beat
Show it off for the world to see
Be a star in your own life
Be a star in your own life
You are a star in your own life
