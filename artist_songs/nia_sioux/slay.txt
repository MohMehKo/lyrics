[Nia & Coco Jones:]
Impressing you? Mmmm
Don't be surprised that's what I do
I slay, and I mean that boo
From the curls of my hair to the tips of my shoes
Too grown for this
Ain't nobody trying to trip
Got too many goals to be stuck on
Watcha talkin 'bout
Such a pretty young thing it's true
Face beat brains too
I shake my thang but don't get confused
I never back down tell em what we do

Stronger than you think I am
Ain't no holding back
Haters throwing shade I ain't got time for that
All I know is we gon' get it
We gon kill it
All we do is slay

You know this is how I act
On my job as a matter of fact (slay)
All up in my business
You can't even handle my fierceness (slay)
You know we too cute to hate
Ain't nobody trippin' off a thing you say (slay)
Excuse me boo you're in my way
Baby we slay

You know that we be killing it
You know that you can't handle it
Me and my girl we're bringing it (okay)
Slay
You know that we be killing it
You know that you can't handle it
Me and my girl we're bringing it
Baby we slay

Stronger than you think I am
Ain't no holding back
Haters throwing shade I ain't got time for that
All I know is we gon' get it
We gon kill it
It all we do is

You know we're to fly for this
Keep my hair on fleek and my nails all did (Slay)
You know we're to fly for this
Keep my hair on fleek and my nails all did (Slay)
You know we're to fly for this
Keep my hair on fleek and my nails all did (Slay)
You know we're too fly for this cause what we do we slay all day

Stronger than you think I am
Ain't no holding back
Haters throwing shade I ain't got time for that
All I know is we gon' get it
We gon kill it
All we do is
(Slay)

You know this is how I act
On my job as a matter of fact (Slay)
All up in my business
You can't even handle my fierceness (Slay)
You know we too cute to hate
Ain't nobody trippin' off a thing you say (Slay)
Excuse me boo you're in my way
Baby we slay

All I know is we gon' kill it all we do is
