Good friends are hard to find
I'm lucky to have someone
We share the best of times
Laughter where ever we go
And even through the tears
I've never felt alone
No-oh-oh

If you're ever feeling down
You can always call on me
Sometimes ya really need a friend
To tell ya that it's not the end
I just want you to know
Imma be here for you

When you need a helping hand
I'll be there through the thick and thin
I just want you to know
Imma be here for you

Sometimes we'll fuss and fight
But we don't stay mad for long
Cause we always apologize
And you know I just want to say
When I feel like giving up
You chase my cares away

So if you're ever feeling down
You can always call on me
Sometimes ya really need a friend
To tell ya that it's not the end
I just want you to know
Imma be here for you

When you need a helping hand
I'll be there through the thick and thin
I just want you to know
Imma be here for you

If you're ever feeling down
You can always call on me
Sometimes ya really need a friend
To tell ya that it's not the end
I just want you to know
Imma be here for you

When you need a helping hand
I'll be there through the thick and thin
I just want you to know
Imma be here for you

Sometimes you really need a friend
To tell ya that it's not the end
I just want you to know
Imma be here for you

When you need a helping hand
I'll be there through the thick and thin
I just want you to know
Imma be here for you
