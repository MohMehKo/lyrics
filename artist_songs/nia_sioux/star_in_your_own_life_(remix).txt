You are a star in your own life
If life is a runway, walk it out
If life is a runway, walk it out

Getting ready in the mirror
Today will be epic
Gotta live the way you wanna
So you don't regret it
Life is a book and you write it
Your happiness is on you
No matter what just keep at it
And push through

Cause you're fearless
Flawless
You got this
So go do it (do it)
Aye, get to it (to it)
Aye

Whoever you choose to be
Own it
It's your drum and it's your beat
Show it off for the world to see
Be a star in your own life
Be a star in your own life
You are a star in your own life

If life is a runway, walk it out
If life is a runway, walk it out
If life is a runway, walk it out
If life is a runway, walk it out

Everybody has a dream that
They need to follow
All you got to do is believe

Life is a book and you write it
Your happiness is on you
No matter what just keep at it
And push through

Cause you're fearless
Flawless
You got this
So go do it (do it)
Aye, get to it (to it)
Aye
