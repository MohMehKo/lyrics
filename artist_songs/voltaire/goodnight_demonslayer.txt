There's a monster that lives ‘neath your bed
Oh for crying out loud it's a futon on the floor
He must be flat as a board

There's a creature that lurks behind the door
Though I've checked there 15 times 
When I leave then he arrives
Every night

Tell the monster that lives ‘neath your bed
To go somewhere else instead
Or you'll kick him in the head

Tell the creature that lurks behind the door
If he knows what's good he won't come here anymore 
Cause you'll kick in his butt at the count of four

Goodnight demon slayer, goodnight
Now it's time to close your tired eyes
There are devils to slay and dragons to ride
If they see you coming, hell they better hide

Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight my little slayer goodnight

Tell the monster that eats children, that you taste bad
And you're sure you'd be the worst that he's ever had
If he eats you, don't you fret, just cut him open with an axe
Don't regret it, he deserved it, he's a cad

Tell the harpies that land on your bed post
That at the count of five you'll roast them alive
Tell the devil its time you gave him his due
He should go back to hell, he should shake in his shoes
Cause the mightiest, scariest, creature is you

Goodnight demon slayer, goodnight
Now it's time to close your tired eyes
There are devils to slay and dragons to ride
If they see you coming, hell they better hide

Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight my little slayer goodnight

I won't tell you, there's nothing ‘neath your bed
I won't tell you, that it's all in your head
This world of ours is not as it seems
The monsters are real but not in your dreams
Learn what you can from the beasts you defeat, 
you'll need it for some of the people you meet

Goodnight demon slayer, goodnight
Now it's time to close your tired eyes
There are devils to slay and dragons to ride
If they see you coming, hell they better hide

Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight my little slayer goodnight

Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight
