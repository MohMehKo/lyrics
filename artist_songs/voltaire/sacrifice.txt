When I hear your name....
I go soaring right back to that place.
Red lit basement bedroom,
incense and your perfume.
Was the final time i saw your face.

Monday at school....
"Oh my god! did you hear who just died?!"
I covered up my ears and I couldn't bare to hear then laugh
about a shot that rang out in the night.
Hold on....
Hold on and on and on...

There's a place where you and I looked in each other's eyes
and swore that we'd be free some day.
So please tell me why you sacrificed all that you would be.
We hadn't much to wait.

A photograph...
is the only piece of you I have.
In that hula skirt you
smiled yet none of us knew
how much pain there was behind your smile.
Hold on....
Hold on and on and on....

There's a place where you and I looked in each other's eyes
and promised we'd be free someday.
So please tell me why you sacrificed all that you would be.
You threw away your dreams.

Only heaven knows why you sacrificed all that you would be.
You threw away our dreams.

So much life to live...
So much love to give...
So much life to live...
So much love to give...
