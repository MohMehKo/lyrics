If the light does not reveal
What I'm feeling for you
If the light does not expose
Please don't fret
My precious heart
If you don't understand
Keep in mind you're not alone

And I may never find
The words to paint
What you are to me
And I may never find them 
Whole.

If the light is not as kind
As the truth is ugly
Every mirror's not a door
Just a stranger always
Kicking, crying, criticizing
Stranger leave yourself alone!

And I may never know
The reasons why I said
What I did, I may never know it
When I did it, I think I knew it
Now I only hope that I get through it

You could have been my guide
To the other side
Out of the storm raging inside
But my hands were tied to
The wall of pride
And my legs were shackled to 
The wall of pride

I guess it's why my blood
It goes ballistic when I see you
Danger turns my heart a drum
It's only you who sends my body
Reeling for the exit
It's only me I'm running from

And I may never know 
What I was doing
Far from your side
I may never know it
When I did it, I think I knew it
Now I only hope that I get through it

You could have been my guide
To the other side
Out of the storm raging inside
But my hands were tied to
The wall of pride
And my legs were shackled to 
The wall of pride

You could have been my guide
To the other side
Out of the storm raging inside
But my hands were tied to
The wall of pride
And my legs were shackled to 
The wall of pride
