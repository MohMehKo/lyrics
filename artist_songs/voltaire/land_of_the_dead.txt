The Minotaur's my butler
The Cyclops my valet
A Centaur draws my chariot that takes me down the way
Through a river made of fire 
To a street that's paved in bones
I got a dozen zombie skeletons to walk me to my throne

In the land of the dead
Heck boy, ain't it grand?
I'm the overlord of the underworld
Cause I hold Horror's Hand
In the land of the dead
I'm darkside royalty
I'm far renowned in the underground
And you can't take that from me

Cerberus my lap dog is loyal as can be
My bed is made of skulls, I'm in the lap of luxury
I've got a Dragon's Blood jacuzzi
the Gorgons think it's cool
And a seven-headed Hydra livin' in my swimmin' pool

In the land of the dead
Heck boy, ain't it grand?
I'm the overlord of the underworld
Cause I hold Horror's Hand
In the land of the dead
I'm darkside royalty
I'm far renowned in the underground
And you can't take that away from me

No you can't take that from me
