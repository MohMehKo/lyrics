He's so afraid when they scream
When they're mean
She was the star of a life
That ceased to be
I die in my dreams
It eats me whole, It eats me whole
All this sorrow disappears
When I learn to shake this fear
And let it go

Sue hates Irene
and Irene,
She hates Sue
I know you hate me
It's okay, I hate you too
Hate is a beast 
It eats me whole, it eats me whole
'Til I take him by the ears,
Turn him 'round, paddle his rear
And let him go

Let it go, let it go, let it go
All this anger dissipates
When I come to shake this hate
And let it go
(Let it go, let it go, let it go,
All this sorrow disappears
when I finally shake this fear
And let it go)

I've been up high and I've been down low
But mostly I've been tired
I'll tell you, the best thing
I ever did was to let it go
