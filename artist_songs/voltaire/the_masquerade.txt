Every day the Masquerade is sending out the call
Every day that Night Bregade came crashing through that door
They said "What are you doing siting all alone just staring at the telephone?
There's a place we know that you can go and join in the parade"
And I said "I'm just sitting here licking my wounds
And I don't think I'll be finished soon
Where can I find a place to hide from this mess I've made?"

At the Masquerade!
You'll be glad you came!
They won't see the holes that in your soul when you cover up your face
At the Masquerade!
It's gonna be ok!
Trade your shame for wealth and fame where no one knows your name!

Blast and break through
They dragged me to this zoo
"Put your mask on: That's the key"
Which animal is right for me?
So I burst through the pearly gates and
I was alarmed by what awaited
They greeted me with open arms: Like I was one of them
And I felt right away they let me in
Absolved me of my prior sins
So I shed this wretched skin at last!
And I became the mask!

At the Masquerade!
You'll be glad you came!
They won't see the holes that in your soul when you cover up your face
At the Masquerade!
It's gonna be ok!
Trade your shame for wealth and fame where no one knows your name!

It's a chance to leave it all behind (leave it all behind)
Start again, begin a brand new life
They were right that I wouldn't hate it
To think that I hesitated
I finally checked my checkered past
And i'm not going back!

At the Masquerade!
You'll be glad you came!
They won't see the holes that in your soul when you cover up your face
At the Masquerade!
It's gonna be ok!
Trade your shame for wealth and fame where no one knows your name!

Come along don't you fear the Masquerade!
Step in: Don't be afraid
Take your pain and deepest shame
And let them go a the Masquerade!
Grab a mask and cover up your face!
Wrap yourself in silk brocade.
Just forget the mistakes you made
Cause no one cares at the Masquerade!
