Life has a way of making you humble
Day after day it's bringing you to your knees
all's okay, then everything crumbles
And all that you perceive is blowing away

But while I'm tearing at the seams
I'll apologize to anything
I'm sorry....

All's black and white when you're just a baby
You get some hair on your chin
you think you know everything
Years go by then everything's "maybe"
and all that you believe
Drowns in a sea of gray

But while I'm tearing at the seams
I'll apologize to anything
I'm sorry, I'm selfish
I'm sorry, I behave this way
I'm sorry, couldn't help it
I'm sorry that you lost your faith in me
We lost our faith in me

But while I'm tearing at the seams
I'll apologize to anything
I'm sorry, I'm selfish
I'm sorry, I behave this way
I'm sorry, couldn't help it
I'm sorry that you lost your faith
I'm sorry that it rains
I'm sorry I ever came
I'm sorry, sorry
