God thinks all blacks are obsolete farm equipment
God thinks the Jews killed his son and must be punished
God thinks the white man is Satan
God, they know what God thinks

God thinks we should all convert to Judaism
God thinks we must all be Christians and
God thinks we should all embrace Islam
God thinks the only true religion is Hinduism

And I, I know what God thinks
God thinks you're a waste of flesh
God prefers an Atheist
God, God

God thinks all people like you are hateful
God thinks all people like you are an embarrassment to creation
Self-righteous
Judgmental
First to throw the stone
And using His name for your own protection

God thinks the Sun revolves around the Earth
God thinks there was something very wrong with Copernicus
God thinks abortion is murder and
God thinks everything that science gave us is wrong
God thinks women deserve it
God thinks AIDS is a form of punishment
I hate people who blame the Devil for their own shortcomings and
I hate people who thank God when things go right

And I, I know what God thinks
God thinks you're an idiot
God prefers a heretic
God, God

God thinks all people like you are hateful
God thinks all people like you are an embarrassment to creation
Self-righteous
Judgmental
First to throw the stone
And using His name for your own agenda

God is a liberal 
God is a democrat
God wants you to vote republican
Never trust a man who puts his words
In the mouth of God and says that it's absolute truth 
It's lies and it smells like death
It's all in a day's work taking money from the poor
Why do you think that God
Would need your dirty money if you want to start a holy war?

Self-righteous
Judgmental
First to throw the stone
Using His name for your own protection

God thinks puppies need to die and
God thinks babies need to drown
'Cause God is neither good nor bad
God is you and me
God is everything
