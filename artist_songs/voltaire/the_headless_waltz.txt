As above, so below, place your bets
Which way the head will roll
Made in your image we are at least
As twisted and mean as thee
'Fore your eyes, what a curious sight
Your children have turned on you
And you say, you don't sleep well at night
Well, we'll take care of that for you

Belle Marie Antoinette
"Love the pearls!" 
They'll make a great tourniquet
Never did as you should and you claim
It was all for our very own good
'Twas a lie, a magnificent lie 
Now, your subjects have turned on you
And you claim you have lots on your mind
Well, we'll take care of that for you

Get that damn thing off the neck
I'm the head of the board now I'm bored of her head
Sharpen up the blade boys, what are you waiting for?
Here's where we all get ahead!
Wipe that damn smile off your face
Or we'll lop it off clean with our new guillotine
Sharpen up the blade boys, what are you waiting for?
Here's where we all get ahead!

All my troubles, all my pain
Stems from this thing that you call a "brain"
Be my guest, sever me from the source
Of all my agony
What a shame, I've forgotten my name 
Without the use of my brain and
"My, bet I'll sleep well tonight!"
Without this head of mine

Get this damn thing off my neck
I'm the head of the board now I'm bored of my head
Sharpen up the blade boys, what are you waiting for?
Here's where we all get ahead!
Wipe that damn smile off your face
Or we'll lop it off clean with our new guillotine
Sharpen up the blade boys
Bells are now tolling, soon heads will be rolling

Please Sir, for me, Sir, 
Won't you see if you see, Sir?
Oh dear, I dread
I seem to have lost my head 
I think I left it about
It fell to the ground 
And I kicked it around
Has anyone seen, no need to be mean, 
My bloody, fat, ugly head?
Please Miss, for me, Sis, 
Won't you see if you see, Sis
It's got black hair
And it's kickin' about in the square
I'm really not totally sure but
I think that it might have rolled into the sewer.
Has anyone seen, no need to be mean, 
My bloody, fat, ugly head?
