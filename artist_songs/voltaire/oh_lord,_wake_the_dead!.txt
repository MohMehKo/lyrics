You better look down and shake your head
Look down and shake your head
Get down and shake a leg
Get down and shake a leg
Jump down and wake the dead
Jump down and wake them
Oh Lord! Oh Lord!
[2x]

Oh Lord! Can it be true?
These things they say about you
Oh what am I to do?
Oh Lord
When I look out of my window
Everything I see
Is hate and murder, stabbin',
Stealin', rape and larceny
Well I heard that you can stop it Lord
But you just let it be
It make you look down and shake your head
They act like rabid monkeys
Chained up in a zoo
And the Bible says that each of us
Is modeled after you
Well hell, that should offend you Lord
If it does, here's what you do

You ought to look down and shake your head
Look down and shake your head
Get down and shake a leg
Get down and shake a leg
Jump down and wake the dead
Jump down and wake them
Oh Lord! Oh Lord!

Oh Lord, can't you see?
What this has done to me?
I've lost my faith in thee
Woes me.
Well the preacher on the TV
He tells me if I'm poor
I should give him all my money
Cause the Lord will give me more
Well I saw him wink and
Drag a sack of cash on out the door
Well, he bought himself a Cadillac
And now I got less than before!
Oh!

Look down and shake your head
Look down and shake your head
Get down and shake a leg
Get down and shake a leg
You better jump down and wake the dead
Jump down and wake them
Oh Lord! Oh Lord!
[2x]

They say you'll bring down Armageddon
They say you'll break the Seventh Seal
Well I hope you bring down Armageddon
Cause through the fire and the brimstone
At least I'll finally know you're real
Real, real, real! Oh!

Oh Lord! How can it be?
That you won't talk to me?
Oh woe, woe's me, poor me

Look down and shake your head
Look down and shake your head
Get down and shake a leg
Get down and shake a leg
You better jump down and wake the dead
Jump down and wake them
Oh Lord! Oh Lord!
[2x]

People on the street, they're ugly, mean and rude
They're bumping into me, they're bumping into you
They never say "excuse me" or "how do you do".
Oh lord
Oh lord

I swear to you the next fool who come shootin' his mouth off
'Bout his almighty friend up in the sky
He's gonna get a mighty load of me when I sound off
In the way of kick right in his eye

You're like my landlord in this hovel where I sit
I always pay my rent but you ain't never fixing shit (shut yo' mouth!)
You should take a look around Lord, your world is just the pits
Oh Lord, Woooaaaah Looord
