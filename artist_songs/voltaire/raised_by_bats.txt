Here at home in this steeple
Made of chrome, above a city of steel,
I’ve chosen bats over people
‘Cause I never did like the way humans made me feel.

So we sleep all day and we rise at night
And we spread our wings and take into the skies.
And when the people look up and stare
And say, “Why you gotta be like that?”
I just look them in the eye and tell them
I was raised by bats!

When I was young, I was feeble
And it stung when they pushed me down.
I was so hated by these people,
That I knew I had to do what I could to get out of that town.

So I ran away to this sacred place
And was taken in by creatures of the night.
Now when the people all stop and stare
And say, “Why you gotta dress like that?”
I just look them in the eye and tell them
I was raised by bats!

When the people all stop and stare
And say, “Why you gotta be like that?”
I just look them in the eye and tell them
I was raised by bats.

Those dark days seem far away
I've risen to a better place
So do like me, follow the dream like that.
Just throw your old life away
And get raised by bats!

So we sleep all day and we rise at night
And we spread our wings and take into the skies.
We do it all our way, live our lives like that
And there’s no one here to fill our heads with lies.

And when the people all stop and stare
And say, “Why you gotta be like that?”
When the people all stop and stare
And say, “Why you gotta dress like that?”
When the people all stop and stare
And say, “Why you gotta be like that?”
I just punch them in the eye and I bite them on the thigh
And I kick them in the ass where the sun don’t shine.
I look them in the eye and tell them
I was raised by bats!

I just look them in the eye and tell them
I was raised by bats!
I was raised by bats!
I was raised by bats!
