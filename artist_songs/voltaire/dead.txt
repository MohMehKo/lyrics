There's a pilot impaled to the wing
and he's Dead!
And all the passengers, they are missing
'cause they're Dead!

Oh someone tell me why
I'm alive I don't even care
And yet I have been spared

There's a girl with a hole in her heart 
and she's Dead!
And there's an infant that's been torn apart
now he's Dead!

Oh, someone tell me why
I'm alive I don't even pray
And yet I have been saved

The good reverend Carlin was right,
he said When you pray 
Only 50% of the time will you get your way
If God doesn't listen to our cries when we call
Someone tell me what's the point of praying at all

There's a man and he lives in the sky
So they said
And he watches us all of the time
So I've read

So someone tell me why 
it could be he won't talk to me
Could it be that I'm deaf?

The good reverend Carlin was right,
he said "When you pray..."
"Only 50% of the time will you get your way"
If God doesn't listen to our cries when we call
Someone tell me what's the point of praying at all

God is all-knowing
And God is all-seeing
Just who do you think that you are
to change his mind

He already knows what you want
And decided that you didn't need it
So don't bother asking for cures or an answer
God is the one who gave you the Cancer!
