I have been in this line of work for a long time
And I have never seen anything so strange
It's so peculiar
It's all so deranged 
See for yourself now
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury
Step right up and view the freak
We caught him red handed
Down by the morgue where he sleeps
And if you think that that's disgusting
Wait 'til you hear this
I never could do it justice
So hear it in his own words

Dead girls like me, oh
Dead girls like me
Can't you see?

I don't expect you to understand me
I am not an ordinary man
And I have seen things with these eyes 
You'd never comprehend
See for yourself now
Take those living women 
They have never shown me any kindness of any kind
It's not my fault I look this way
I try to talk to them
They look at me
They walk away
So, really, is it so strange that

Dead girls like me
Can't you see?
Only dead girls like me, oh
Dead girls like me
Can't you see?
Only dead girls don't walk away from me
Sad as it seems

Have you ever tasted love like this?
Cool and smooth
And have you ever been accepted unconditionally?
Have you ever loved someone
Who didn't hurt you
Didn't harm you?

There's no pain and there's no pressure
No verbal humiliation
There's no fear
There's no shame
There's no pulse, so is it so strange?

Dead girls like me
Can't you see?
Only dead girls like me, oh
Dead girls like me
Can't you see?
Only dead girls don't walk away from me
Sad as it seems
