I was on a cruise ship out at sea, my fianc√©e and me
The ship went down, everybody drowned
And I was just glad the sea didn't swallow me
Oh, I was in distress, 'cause my hair was such a mess
And so I washed up on a beach
Nine hungry eyes were staring down at me.

I'm in the middle of the Cannibal Buffet
I'm feeling well; they like me that way
See, if you really wanna know what's eatin' me
It's the man-eaters on the coast of Barbary

Oh, trouble was afoot - they were eatin' mine
Toein' the party line,
I was startin' to feel, "these guys are heels"
But, the truth be told, these cannibals have got sole
Hey, numbskull, look at me, I got a bone to pick with thee
You ain't humerus, stop ribbin' me
Have a spine, bone up on settin' me free 

I'm in the middle of the Cannibal Buffet
I'm feelin' rare; they like me that way
See, if you really wanna know what's eatin' me
It's the man-eaters on the coast of Barbary

Missionaries came to this place
They taught us manners
Now we cannibals always say grace...
(Thank you God for this weiner we're about to eat, and the
sweet buns we're about to stick it in)
And then we eat your face!

I'm in the middle of the Cannibal Buffet
I'm feeling well; they like me that way
See, if you really wanna know what's eatin' me
It's the man-eaters on the coast of Barbary
It's the man-eaters on the coast of Barbary
It's the man-eaters... on the coast of Barbary!

(Ooh, oh, ah, oh, whoooooaa....not my peepee!)
