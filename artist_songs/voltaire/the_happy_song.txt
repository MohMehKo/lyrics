[Spoken:]
A Buddhist on the subway tells me that
What you want is rarely, if ever, what you need.
And of course, I argue the point like a completely self-righteous idiot.

[Sung:]
I was looking for perfection
And it found me, right between the eyes
All this time we spent in bliss,
You know, like all things, it has to fade away
The devil says beware
Cus when you ask, you might get what you want
The devil, he may care
When you ask, you might get what you want

[Spoken:]
So now I spend most of my time waiting for things to happen,
Letting the wind take me where it will.

[Sung:]
Only when it's done do you lose the veil
You get so blind you never see the light coming down the tracks
It keeps me hanging from a thread
Devil drives the train,
Devil pass me by

This is the happy song I wrote for you
You know, this is the happy song I never wrote for you

And after all this time,
And after all the lies
Never dreamed you would seem to me little more than an earthly waste of time
After all these precious opportunities that I had to set things right
Dissolve like regret in heaven, they do
And she said

Anata no namae o yuki ni kaku
Keredomo nani mo iwanai.
[Japanese translation:]
You write your name in the snow
Yet say nothing.

This is the happy song I wrote for you
This is the happy song I never wrote for you

After all this time, and after all the lies
Never dreamed you would seem to me little more than an earthly waste of time
After all these precious opportunities that I had to set things right 
Dissolve like regret in heaven,
Zen Buddhist heaven.
