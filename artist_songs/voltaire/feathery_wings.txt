You, there on the bridge
Where've you been, what's your name?
And you, there on the wall
Where will you go to, once you fall?
You, lost at sea
Do you need me, do you need directions?
Hey, put down the gun
What are you thinking?
You were someone's son

The taste of tears
The sting of pain
The smell of fear
The sounds of crying, oh

A long, long time ago, I fell to this place
From another dimension
And thrust amongst the beasts
And the way they behave, it borders on dementia
Now through all these years
I can barely take it
I don't think I can make it
Take me away from here
I want to go home
I'm so sick and tired of

The taste of tears
The sting of pain
The smell of fear
The sounds of crying, oh

As you're standing at the edge of your life
What do you remember?
Was it all you wanted?

I'm trying to earn a set of feathery wings
I wish I could protect you here
Oh, please don't cry, now, smile
As you're standing at the edge of your life
Your troubles are over
Mine are just beginning

I'm trying to earn a set of feathery wings
To take me away from here
It's me you leave behind

Oh, if only I could have been there
I'd be a hand for the sinking
If only I could have been there
I'd be a prayer for the dying
See the pain etched in my face,
Oh, I'm so sick and tired of

The taste of tears
The sting of pain
The smell of fear
The sounds of crying, oh

As you're standing at the edge of your life
What do you remember?
Was it all you wanted?

I'm trying to earn a set of feathery wings
I wish I could protect you here
Oh, please don't cry, now, smile
As you're standing at the edge of your life
Your troubles are over
Mine are just beginning

I'm trying to earn a set of feathery wings
To take me away from here
It's me you leave--

You're gone from here
Don't leave from here
Don't leave me here
I hate it here
You're gone from here
Don't leave me here
I need you here
I need to see you smile
