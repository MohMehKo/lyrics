It happened at a birthday celebration
You said by all accounts I made a scene
I told off-color jokes,
Offended several folks.
I guess perhaps I might see what you mean.

Now if you were to take me to a funeral,
I'd be the only fool there in a party hat.
I mean no disrespect,
I just think "What the heck?
I might just make a grieving widow laugh."
Your girlfriends say it all the time,
But your mama says it, too,
You married a fool
You married a fool
You married a fool
But I'm a fool for you. I met you where you worked, down at the tavern.
We sang karaoke songs until you closed.
I guess I drank too much,
And maybe I lost touch.
I'm not sure why I took of all my clothes.

It's nothing new, hell, you can ask my mother.
I was a joker and a classclown back in school.
And I take any gaffe
Just to make some people laugh.
And I don't care if I come off a fool.
Your girlfriends say it all the time,
But your mama says it, too,
You married a fool
You married a fool
You married a fool
But I'm a fool for you.

At night we get in bed and we turn out the lights.
It's not a hint of irony, it's not a joke in sight.
But in this great, big world of ours
You're the only one around who can see the real me
Through the make-up of this sad and wounded clown.
I like to think I'm like Kenny Rogers
When I stay out late at night and play my songs.
But this song is no "Lady"
In fact, they're all quite shady.
I guess I only sing 'bout things gone wrong.

A friend asked if you were my inspiration.
You told her: "Have you heard this moron sing?
Even has a song that says that
I lost my head when he gave me the ring.
What a godawful thing to sing!"
Your girlfriends say it all the time,
But your mama says it, too,
But they can't see between the lines
To the truth of me and you,
I guess I might seem asinine,
So hey it might be true that
You married a fool
You married a fool
You married a fool
But this fool ain't nothin' but a fool in love with you.
