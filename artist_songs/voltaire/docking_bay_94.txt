Well it's hot as hell out there 
and the suns they bake the streets
but it's cool in here, in this cantina where we meet.

The room is full of faces
I've never seen before,
I guess folks look strange
when you've run away from home..

Well, It's pretty rough in here 
there's a guy who pushed me 'round.
On my friend he laid a hand
and it ended on the ground.

Then we met a hairy beast
and his partner's name is Han
and they've got a ship
that shined in the Kessel Run.

I left all the talking to Obi Wan.
And though he's old I think he's the only one...
who gets who I am
and that I need a change
and his eyes light up, when he says my father's name.

Docking Bay 94, that's where we're gonna meet
and they'll take me, take me, off of the dune sea.
See my family is gone and there's nothing left for me
on this wasted, wasteland, they call Tatooine.

They say we're off to meet a princess
I never dared to dream or even think it.
She'll be so pretty I bet I won't be able to resist her,
But then, my luck's been so bad, Mister, 
she'll probably end up being my own sister!

Docking Bay 94, that's where we're gonna meet
and they'll take me, take me, off of the dune sea.
See my family is dead and there's nothing left for me
on this wasted, wasteland, they call Tatooine.

We reach the docking bay
and the ship's a hunk of junk
and I worrying if
I'll have to ride in the trunk

Then some troopers shoot at us
and I'm wondering what for
and Han guns it and blast us
out of Docking Bay 94!

Docking Bay 94, that's where it all began
now the engines are roaring, goodbye ball of sand!
I'll visit other worlds, 
I'll avenge my father's name
One things for sure, life will never be the same
after Docking Bay 94.
