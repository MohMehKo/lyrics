I want to wake up from this horrible dream.
I want to open up my eyes to find life's not as it would seem.
I want to wake up from this horrible dream.
I want to open up my eyes to find life's not as it would seem.

The cabinet floats in the murky water,
Bobbing in the slime that trickles out of the cerebellum
And right on down your spine.
Well I don't know what you've been told
But there's more than one truth: This I know.
I don't know just what you fear
But take a look in here.
And when the walls of Earth rise up around you
Rise to another plane.

And wake up from this horrible dream.
I want to open up my eyes to find life's not as it would seem.
I want to wake up from this horrible dream.
I want to open up my eyes to find life's not as it would seem.

The eternal question of reality;
It still stands today.
Is life a dream that we believe
Only to fade away?
Is death a door or is it the end?
Did I take my life only to find myself in another bed
Dreaming another life?
And when the walls of Earth rise up around you
Rise to another plane.
And when the arms of Earth reach up to grab you
Rise to another plane!

And wake up from this horrible dream.
I want to open up my eyes to find life's not as it would seem.
I want to wake up from this horrible dream.
I want to open up my eyes to find life's not as it would seem.

I never felt like I belonged here
With these creatures to depraved.
Now if only I could find a way out of this place
I could finally plan my escape
And wake up!

I want to wake up from this horrible dream.
I want to open up my eyes to find life's not as it would seem
I want to wake up from this horrible dream.
Open up my eyes to find life's not as it would seem
And wake up!

Tear the veil that covers up our lives.
What you want is right before your eyes!
Yeah! Just wake up!
Wake-up...
Wake-up...
Wake-up...
Wake-up...
Wake-up...
