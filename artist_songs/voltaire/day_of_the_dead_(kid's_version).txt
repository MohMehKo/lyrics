I was just a tourist the first time I went to Mexico
I was a stranger, in danger, in a world unknown
A clap of thunder and the ground around me did explode
And the skeletons in dozens come out from that hole

Why? No lie!
It was the Day of the Dead! 
Did you hear what I just said?
Oh-oh-ohh
I didn't even know
It was the Day of the Dead!
I tried not to lose my head
Oh-oh-ohh
Way down in Mexico

The place was jumping with carribas swaying to and fro
An evil skeleton made off with my beef burrito
They opened the pinata and a swarm of guts went up my nose
I lost all bowel control and knew that it was time to go

Why? No lie!
It was the Day of the Dead! 
Did you hear what I just said?
Oh-oh-ohh
I didn't even know
It was the Day of the Dead! 
I tried not to lose my head
Oh-oh-ohh
Way down in Mexico

The locals tell me not to fear
It happens at least once a year
When hell is full the dead will walk the Earth and
Apparently they come up here
For the beer!

Why? No lie!
It was the Day of the Dead!
Did you hear what I just said?
Oh-oh-ohh
I didn't even know
It was the Day of the Dead! 
I tried not to lose my head
Oh-oh-ohh
Way down in Mexico

Dia de los muertos
El calacas vio
Oh-oh-ohh
Y el gringo se asusto
Dia de Los Muertos
El cabron se arrugo
Oh-oh-ohh
Aqui en Mexico

CORRE CARAJO QUE LOS MUERTOS ESTAN EN LA CALLE!
