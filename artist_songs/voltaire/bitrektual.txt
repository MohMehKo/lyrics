[Jason:] Live long and prosper, if you're one of us.
[Voltaire:] May the force be with you, unless that phrase don't fit you.
[Jason:] Forever, we have been at odds.
[Voltaire:] Cause you're a drooling Trekkie
[Jason:] Says the Lucas lackey.
[Voltaire (lead), Jason (harmony):] Whatever!

[Jason:] We are out in space the last frontier,
[Jason:] Seeking life that's new and strange out here
[Jason (lead), Voltaire (harmony):] and new civilizations in the great beyond.
[Jason:] boldly going where no one has gone.

[Voltaire:] Our tale is better in every way. 
[Voltaire:] in a galaxy far far away
[Voltaire (lead), Jason (harmony):] a great adventure happened a long time ago,
[Voltaire:] but then I don't suppose that you would know.

[Jason:] We have ray guns we call phasers
[Voltaire:] We have blasters AND lightsabers
[Jason:] We have ships that fly at warp
[Voltaire:] Yeah, it's called "Hyperspace", you dork!
[Jason (lead), Voltaire (harmony):] We've got the Mugato and you have got Ewoks!
[Voltaire:] yeah, well, a guy who plays with tribbles shouldn't talk!

[Jason:] Oh come on let's not fight, 
[Jason (lead), Voltaire (harmony):] it's so unintellectual.
[Jason:] How 'bout we join sides and be bi-trektual?
[Voltaire (spoken):] that's disgusting 
[Jason (spoken):] yeah, forget I mentioned it.

[Jason:] Klingons shooting at our starboard side. 
[Jason:] We've got a hull breach on the Enterprise.
[Jason (lead), Voltaire (harmony):] We drift into the neutral zone and we're on the wrong side.
[Jason:] We'd need a wormhole to get out alive.

[Voltaire:] On a moon of Yavin's where we hide. 
[Voltaire:] We're having trouble with the hyperdrive.
[Voltaire (lead), Jason (harmony):] This planet keeps on spinning and the Death star's now in sight.
[Voltaire:] We hope the rebels take it out in time.

[Voltaire:] Oh, come on let's not fight,
[Voltaire (lead), Jason (harmony):] it's so unintellectual.
[Voltaire:] How 'bout we join sides and be bi-trektual?
[Jason:] Wouldn't it be nice 
[Jason (lead), Voltaire (harmony):] and so much more effectual?
[Jason:] To put our cares aside and be bitrektual!

[Voltaire:] Think how awesome it would be a
[Voltaire:] team up with Jean Luc and Leah,
[Jason:] Kirk and Chewie save the day,
[Jason:] blowing up a bird of prey.
[Voltaire:] Han and Spock they set a net 
[Voltaire:] and trap the Borg and Boba Fett
[Voltaire:] While 3P0 and Data raid a Tie fighter to capture Vader.
[Voltaire (lead), Jason (harmony):] Luke and Worf get into it and blow the Deathstar into bits
[Jason:] And then we throw the tribbles
[Jason (lead), Voltaire (harmony):] into the Sarlac pit
[Voltaire:] and then we kicked the Ewoks into it.

[Jason:] Live long and prosper, so say we all 
[Voltaire (spoken):] Wait, what?
[Voltaire:] May the force be with you, May the time Lords keep you.
[Jason (lead), Voltaire (harmony):] Forever, we can Babylon
[Voltaire:] There's no use debating, 
[Voltaire (lead), Jason (harmony):] the Stargate's waiting,

[Voltaire:] So come on let's not fight,
[Voltaire (lead), Jason (harmony):] it's so unintellectual.
[Voltaire:] How 'bout we join sides and be bi-trektual?
[Jason (lead), Voltaire (harmony):] So let's take the advice of an Asian homo-sexual...

[Voltaire:] "Fellow Star folks, cool it down!"
[Robert Picardo:] Celebrity voice impersonated.

[Jason (lead), Voltaire (harmony):] Let's put our cares aside and be bitrektual!
[Voltaire:] Hell, I want to be Sci Fi multi-Trektual!

[Jason (spoken):] Live long and prosper,
[Voltaire (spoken):] May the force be with you!
[Jason (spoken):] Never give up, never surrender!
[Voltaire (spoken):] To infinity and Beyond!!!!!
[Jason (spoken):] Really, Voltaire? Really?
