Is it so wrong if I don't pay my rent?
No! Responsibility, I gave it up for lent
Sell your wares, pollute the air
I don't care
Fresh air's for squares
Now if it were up to me
The piper would be up the creek 
and the fiddler too
'Cause neither one of you would be paid
I need the cash for getting laid 
And I don't mind
To seem unusually unkind
You ask what kind of guy am I

I'm a friend of the irresponsible fools
Who don't have time for rules
The irresponsible who wouldn't
be caught dead in a school
I'm irresponsible
I'm Mr. Irresponsible
I'm irresponsible, and I don't care
If the whole wold burns

I live my life without a care
I don't have time to be 
Politically aware
I hate to have to think 
I hate feeling too
I'll leave those chores to some
Pathetic sap like you
Don't talk to me about the
Dolphin in the tuna net
I'm on the tuna's side
Hey, dolphin tastes quite good I bet
I'd never lie, my hair requires aerosol
I want it ten feet tall
And I don't care about the hole in the sky
If Rogue don't mind, why should I?
It just so happens I'm that kind of guy

I'm a friend of the irresponsible fools
Who don't have time for rules
The irresponsible who wouldn't
be caught dead in a school
I'm irresponsible
I'm Mr. Irresponsible
I'm irresponsible, and I don't care
If the whole wold burns
(Let it burn)

It's a bloody miracle that I haven't gotten 
Distracted by a skirt and got bored
And just walked away
Before the end of this God forsaken tune
