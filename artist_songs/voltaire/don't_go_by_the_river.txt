Don’t go by the river
If you love your wife
‘Cause you’ll make that girl a widow
And you’ll cause her pain and strife
If you go by the river side,
You’ll lose your l-l-l-l-life!

People by the river,
They know who’s the boss
They’ll get at fancy city folks
No matter what the cost
And if you go by the river side,
You’ll end up l-l-l-l-lost!

There's a bat they call Lestat 
Who’ll sink his teeth in you
You might meet a creature from the swampy black lagoon
And if the moon is full, 
You might meet the loup-garou
Don’t go by the river side,
You’ll be sorry if you do!

A young man met a lady
And she made this fellow swoon
So they went on down to New Orleans
To elope under the moon
He took her by the river side,
To give her the heir l-l-l-loom!

Well the next day he got outta bed and
She wasn’t by his side
He searched the quarter high and low
When the bayou far and wide
Locals say she ran away 
But you know they l-l-l-l-lie!

There's a bat they call Lestat 
Who’ll sink his teeth in you
You might meet a creature from the swampy black lagoon
And if the moon is full, 
You might meet the loup-garou
Don’t go by the river side,
You’ll be sorry if you do!

Who shivers when they hear about voo-doo?
Don’t lie to me, boy, I know you do!
You better tremble when you hear me call!
‘Cause you’d make a lovely shrunken head
You’ll be my favorite voo-doo doll!

Sting went by the river,
Now he slings on Bourbon Street
And there’s that song by Concrete Blonde about where it’s warm and green
And if you go by the river side,
You’ll never l-l-l-l-leave!

There's a bat they call Lestat 
Who’ll sink his teeth in you
You might meet a creature from the swampy black lagoon
And if the moon is full, 
You might meet the loup-garou
Don’t go by the river side,
(Don’t go by the river side!)
Said don’t go by that river side,
(Said don’t go by that river side!)
Don’t go by the river side,
(Why's that?)
‘Cause you might meet me if you do!
