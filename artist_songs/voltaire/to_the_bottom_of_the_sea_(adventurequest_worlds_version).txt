Our Moglin cook, he grabbed all he could took. 
He say, "no storm is stoppin' me!" 
He made fricassee of a sea anemone. 
Down at the bottom of the sea. 

I turned to my first officer and I said,
"What have you got to say to me?" 
Well, he turned and said, "I'm in over my head." 
Down at the bottom of the sea. 

A she-Braken, lurkin' under my men, 
Looked up at their legs hungrily. 
She counted eight so she thought she found a mate. 
Down at the bottom of the sea. 

They kicked and they fought but it was all for naught 
'Cause she just wouldn't set 'em free. 
She had them taught in a tight sailor's knot
Down at the bottom of the sea. 

When the Braken's loose
Grabs you like a noose
Cryin' ain't no use.
I just reach out for a barrel of Moglin Juice! 

Cysero, was sad to see him go. 
His story don't end happily. 
He drifted by with a fishgig in his eye. 
Down at the bottom of the Sea. 

Down at the bottom was treasure galore, 
But guarding it so greedily was 
An angry horde of skeletons with 
swords. Down at the bottom of the sea.

(For BattleOn!)

When the Braken's loose 
Grabs you like a noose 
Cryin' ain't no use. 
I just reach out for a barrel of Moglin Juice! 
Down at the bottom of the... 
We're at the bottom of the... 
Stuck at the bottom of the deep, dark, crazy-fish 
Dwellin', between the Braken and the deep blue sea.
