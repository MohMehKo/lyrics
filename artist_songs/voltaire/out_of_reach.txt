You'll burn my flag
You'll crash my car
You'll kill my cat
You'll break my balls
You'll watch my cities fall
But not tonight

You're the devil's own
You'll cheat and lie
And you won't stop until you stole the glimmer from my eye
But not tonight
'Cause I won't let you

I know you want to
But not with me
It's all so clear to see
You can try to destroy me
But not tonight
'Cause I won't let you through
You can fight if you like some other time
You'll find I'm out of reach
Your words can't hurt me
I'm out tonight

You'll burn my flag
You're my demise
You'll orchestrate my fall
You'll kill my cat
You'll burn my bridge
You'll scale my castle wall
To get to me
You'll break my will
You'll sell my soul
You'll take my heart and replace it with a gaping hole
And step on me
I won't let you

I know you want to
But not with me
It's all so clear to see
You can try to destroy me
But not tonight
'Cause I won't let you through
You can fight if you like some other time
You'll find I'm out of reach
Your words can't touch me
I'm out tonight

My heart's divided
Yes, surrender would be nice
To just lay down my sword and shield by the flowers
But I know that you lie in wait tonight
But I won't let you

'Cause I know you want to 
But not with me
It's all so clear to see
You can try to destroy me
But not tonight
'Cause I won't let you through
You can fight if you like
You can scream if you want
Yell your stubborn head off
Anything at all
Your words can't hurt me
Your words can't touch me 
Your words can't hurt me
I'm out tonight
