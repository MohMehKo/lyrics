Don't touch me tonight
I might lash out in fright.
Lie on my bed but don't you move, dear.
I know you know not with whom we sleep tonight.

Don't touch me tonight while I'm sleeping.
I may lose my head if I hear your breathing.
You lie by my side, thought you'd seduce me.
Much to your surprise I hit the ceiling.
I know you know not with whom we sleep tonight.

Never, Never!
I never cried, I never cried,
I let it eat me up alive!
Under the light I told a lie.
I kept this secret safe inside.
No devil hides beneath my bed.
He slept with me tonight.
He'll take this child's snow white innocence,
Never, Never!

Don't touch me tonight
While I'm dreaming.
Don't be surprised if I tear off screaming.
I know you know not with whom we sleep tonight.

Never, Never!
I never cried, I never cried,
I let it eat me up alive!
Under the light I told a lie.
I kept this secret safe inside.
No devil hides beneath my bed.
He slept with me tonight.
He'll take this child's snow white innocence,
Never, Never!

So if you're wondering why I cant sleep at night,
I shared my bed with fear and pain I'll share my bed with them again...
Never Never!

Never, Never!
I never cried, I never cried,
I let it eat me up alive!
Under the light I told a lie.
I kept this secret safe inside.
No devil hides beneath my bed.
He slept with me tonight.
He slept with me tonight.
He slept with me tonight.
He'll take this child's snow white innocence,
Never, Never!
