Oh, the moon was full 
In the color of blood 
The night the Werewolves came 
To the Vampire Club 
A wolf named Jake tried to show off 
He walked up to Bella with his shirt off. 
Well, he recognized a Vampire 
From his school 
He said something that was 
Most uncool, 
"Hey, Pretty Boy, with the Sparkly skin! 
I'm gonna steal your girl, 
'Cause I hate your kin!"

Fur was flying, capes were torn 
Hell hath no fury like a werewolf scorn. 
Number one rule in this Clan 
Slay the undead who invade your land. 
Wolves were maimed, vampires were crushed 
By furry paws in a rush. 
Bela Lugosi orders a bud, he said, 
"Who let these fools in my vampire club?" 

Emmet chucked a werewolf over his head 
Alice saw the future and pronounced him dead 
Jasper glittered all over the wall, so they 
Hung him from the ceiling for a Disco Ball. 
There was so much angst after the fight, 
Edward and Bella broke up that night. 
While some wolves chowed down on a puddle of food 
That used to be some rasta vampire dude. 

Fur was flying, capes were torn 
Hell hath no fury like a werewolf scorn. 
Number one rule in this Clan 
Slay the undead who invade your land. 
Wolves were maimed, vampires were crushed 
By furry paws in a rush. 
Old Max Schreck orders a Bud, and says: 
"Get these shmucks out of my vampire club!" 

It's hard to believe after all this dreck 
Ed still hasn't bit his girlfriend's neck 
Though she begs and pleads and pleads and begs 
Bella is still not living dead. 
The Cullen Clan is a peaceful bunch, 
On Human Blood they refuse to much. 
But a real vampire would have a hunch, 
To never fall in love with your high school lunch!

By furry paws in a rush. 
Christopher Lee orders a Bud, and says: 
"You'd better not sparkle in my Vampire Club!"
