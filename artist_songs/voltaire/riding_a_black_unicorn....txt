A darkness falls over the land
Enslaves with a wave of its hand
And I try to see
The light through the disease
I tried to get up on my feet
Been so long, shackled down on my knees
For somewhere deep inside, I know
That fate favors the bold

So tonight, I'm riding a black unicorn
Down the side of an erupting volcano
And I drink, drink, drink
From a chalice filled 
With the laughter of small children

When darkness is drowning your soul
And makes you feel alone in the cold
Find me, and grab ahold
This chalice, it overflows

So tonight, you're riding a black unicorn
Down the side of an erupting volcano
And you drink, drink, drink
From a chalice filled 
With the laughter of small children

Lords of strength and gods of might
Hand over the reins
Bless our path, that tonight
We find the will to break these chains
And ride!

So tonight, we're riding our black unicorns
Down the side of an erupting volcano
And we drink, drink, drink
From a chalice filled 
With the laughter of small children
And the blood and tears of our enemies
