Where's the girl I fell in love with?
Where'd she go?
Where's that kind and gentle princess
Of my dreams?
Where'd she go?
Why'd she go away?
Where'd she go?
Why'd you take her away from me?

Where's the child who use to play there
In her eyes?
Could it be she still resides there
In disguise?
Everyday I look for a sign
It's all in vain, a colossal waste of time

What have you done to her?
Why have you taken her away?
Where have you buried her?
Hid from the light of day
(So far away from me
So out of reach)

(Does she still live behind your eyes?)
