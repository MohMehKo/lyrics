I knew a girl
She was so young
So full of dreams
So ready for love 
She met a boy whose words were like
The waves
In came the tide
And she was swept away

I knew a boy
He was so young
So full of steam
So ready for lust
He met a girl who
Held a wondrous prize
He said the magic words
To open up her thighs.

Ten years have past 
He's on your mind
As long as you live
He'll always be that guy
No so for him
For whom it was a game
He may recall the night
But he can't 
Remember your name

And you lose nothing!
You've lost nothing!
You've lost nothing!
You've lost nothing!
Welcome to the world.
