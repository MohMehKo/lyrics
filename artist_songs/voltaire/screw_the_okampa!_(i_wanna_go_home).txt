We were in the badlands one day
Chasing b'elanna and chakotay
We were wizzed then to the delta quadrant
Fuck, that's far away

I wanna go home, please let me go home
I say 'screw the ocampa, I wanna go home.'

The caretaker had an array
That could get us home safe
But janeway, that ignorant slut
She blew it away

I wanna go home, please let me go home
Drop me off at a worm hole, I wanna go home

So now I'm stuck here for years
In the delta quadrant, I fear
With the kazon and hirogen and a brother with pointy ears

I wanna go home, please let me go home
Talaxian chicks are ugly, I wanna go home

So hoist up the aft nacelles
See how the warp core burns
Tell janeway to go to hell
I wanna go home

I wanna go home, please let me go home
I say 'fuck the ocampa, I wanna go home.'
