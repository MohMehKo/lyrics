Did you find what you were looking for
And did you hear what you needed to hear
And did I serve you well, did I serve you well
Did I serve any purpose, any one at all

Did you come for redemption or a resurrection
Mayhaps a bandage for a gaping wound
I know I put one there
Or perhaps you were bored
Or mayhaps you were confused
Did I serve any purpose, any one at all

A crown of thorns would suit you well
You hang there at a loss
A crown of thorns would suit you
I'd shake your hands if they weren't nailed to a cross

I don't want to believe (this is the end)
I don't want to believe
I don't want to believe
I don't want to believe
I don't want you to leave

And is that, is that all
Is that, is that all you wanted
Is that, is that all you wanted me to know
Is that, is that all

I don't mind you dragging me around
And I don't mind as long as I know where you're taking me
And did I serve you well, did I serve you well
Did I serve any purpose, anyone at all

A crown of thorns would suit me well
I hang here at a loss
A crown of thorns would suit me
I'd lend a hand if it weren't nailed to a cross

I don't want to believe
I don't want to believe
I don't want you to leave me here nailed to this question mark

I don't want to believe
I don't want to believe
I don't want you to leave

And is that, is that all (this is the end)
Is that, is that all you wanted
Is that, is that all you wanted me to know
Is that, is that all you had to tell me
