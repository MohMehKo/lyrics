If you're headin' down the highway
Down about route ten,
Get off at the last exit
And take it around the bend
You'll find a small town
But don't go hangin' 'round.
'Cause hate lives in a small town
'Least that's what I have found.
Moms are in the kitchens
And they're baking pies.
They smell so good, they're made to
Cover up the smell of lies
There in a small town.
But pies don't cure all ills.
And hate lives in a small town,
That's why those moms take pills.

Well, I went to the big city
And everyone was wearing black.
They saw that in my home town,
They wouldn't stand for that.
I saw kids all covered in tattoos,
With mohawks and purple hair.
But what really struck me,
Was no one seemed to care!

Well, the Knights they beat the Badgers
When they played down on the square
But they saved the biggest beatings
For a kid with longish hair.
They're in a small town.
That kid was me one year.
'Cause hate lives in a small town
Moreso if you seem queer.

The pastors in the pulpit,
Preaching righteous lies.
And the congregation, they don't know
He slept with all their wives.
They're in a small town,
And it's so plain to see
That hate lives in a small town,
As does adultery.

I went to the big city,
With my clothes in a pack.
When I got off at the station,
There was no turning back.
I met freaks and creeps and weirdos,
Loose women and some geeks.
And they were the nicest gosh darn people,
I could ever hope to meet.

When you roll into a small town,
They're nice as they can be.
But at night they put on sheets,
And hang your sad ass from a tree.
They're in a small town,
Don't dare be different.
'Cause hate lives in a small town
Unless you're just like them.

If you're living in a small town,
And you feel you're in a vice.
Just buy yourself a ticket, kid,
Just take my advice.
And leave the small town,
Be quick as you can be.
Get out of that small town,
And you'll be free like me.
