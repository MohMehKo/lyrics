The day is the wife whom I elude.
The one to whom I should be right.
Though forewarned by peers and kin
I always give in to the night.
Mother always warned me such,
being a nocturnal soul
Besides just being simply strange
Spawns from some illness of the mind.

But the Night,
She calls me
She calls me
She calls me
She calls me
She sways in her velvet dress
And pulls me towards her in the dark
While the others rest
While the others rest
While the others rest

Heed the call the time has come
for you children of the Night
Gather 'round like suckling dogs
Mother's come she is the Night.
Come with me to the other side.
Make that girl in black your bride!

But the Night,
She calls me
She calls me
She calls me
She calls me
She sways in her velvet dress
And pulls me towards her in the dark
While the others rest
While the others rest
While the others rest

I see the light
coming through the blinds.
I close my eyes.
I don't care if you think it's wrong.
I'm gonna sleep the whole day long.
The sun goes down, This is my wake up call.

It still seems very strange to me
that her quiet, lonely streets
draped in all their mystery
could be so sweet and comforting

But the Night,
She calls me
She calls me
She calls me
She calls me
She sways in her velvet dress
And pulls me toward her in the dark
While the others rest
While the others rest
While the others rest
