Gather weary travelers, I have a tale to tell. 
It might just save your lives but only if you listen well. 
'Cause there before the breakers and just around the way, 
there's a sign that says, "Beware The Beast of Pirate's Bay!" 

Some say he's a guppy a kind threw in the sea. He ate so 
many sailors now he's bigger than a tree. His teeth are sharp 
as scissors his claws, they are like knives. And if you think 
he's ugly, wait 'til you see his insides! 

Oh, don't you sail and don't you row and certainly 
don't you swim, 'cause if you aren't careful you'll end up 
inside of him. He'll eat you up, he'll spit you out. You'd 
better stay away. Heed the sign that says "Beware The Beast of Pirate's Bay!" 

Some say he's a serpent that came straight from hell to eat 
the souls of pirates and other ne'er-do-wells. Some they 
don't believe it as for me I've got a hunch. 'Cause they used 
to have some pirates here. But he ate them all for lunch. 

Oh, don't you sail and don't you row and certainly 
don't you swim, 'cause if you aren't careful you'll end up 
inside of him. He'll eat you up, he'll spit you out. You'd 
better stay away. Heed the sign that says "Beware The Beast of Pirate's Bay!" 

Well, good ol' Captain Rhubarb, he came to Pirate's Bay. 
Seems his little Trobble had nearly got away. 
He reached into the water to grab it from the sand. There was 
a crunch and a scream! And now that scurvy Captain's got hooks on both his hands! 

Oh, don't you sail and don't you row and certainly 
don't you swim, 'cause if you aren't careful you'll end up 
inside of him. He'll eat you up, he'll spit you out. You'd 
better stay away. Heed the sign that says "Beware The Beast of Pirate's Bay!" 

Well, Blackberry the Pirate, you know for what he's feared. 
It's mostly for the dark, imposing color of his beard. He saw 
the beast and now nobody's scared of him because, his beard 
turned white and all agree, he looks like Santa Claus. 

Oh, don't you sail and don't you row and certainly 
don't you swim, 'cause if you aren't careful you'll end up 
inside of him. He'll eat you up, he'll spit you out. You'd 
better stay away. Heed the sign that says "Beware The Beast of Pirate's Bay!" 

Well, now Yulgar's inn is empty and there's only you and me. 
And if you care I'd like to share how this song came to be. 
So come a little closer if you really want to know. This very 
sad and woeful tale happened so long ago. 

Well, I was just a little boy when I went to Pirate's Bay and 
there I saw a creature that was very much dismayed. 
With a harpoon in his dorsal fin and a hook stuck in his side, 
this mighty whale was in such pain, we both began to cry. 

I pushed and I shoved but he wouldn't give way into the 
deeper waters off our shallow Pirate's Bay. All I could do 
to help him was to keep people away, so I wrote a sign that 
said, "Beware The Beast of Pirate's Bay!" And what did it say? 

Oh, don't you sail and don't you row and certainly don't you 
swim, 'cause if you aren't careful you'll end up inside of 
him. He'll eat you up, he'll spit you out. You'd better stay 
away. Heed the sign that says "Beware!. Hell I should know I put it there! 
Heed the sign that says, "Beware The Beast of Pirate's Bay!"
