Rain soaked soul of mine
It's a gray day here
From ice cold eyes march
A parade of tears

It's hopeless don't it seem
When even in my dreams
You put me through Hell

I've tried everything I could
To make you see the good in me
I'm just sorry that I failed
Keep your empty tears

It's hopeless don't it seem
When even in my dreams
You put me through Hell
And left me this way
It's so obscene
You were so mean
When you meant everything to me
I'll see you in Hell
Just go on this way
And then some day
When you awake
I'll be a thousand miles away
(And you'll be in Hell
Least I hope you will)
(Somewhere near Hell)
