I was just a noob the first time I went to BattleOn. 
I was a stranger, in danger in a world gone wrong. 
I was surrounded by a sinister, unholy throng. 
Went to my inventory and I put my armor on. 
Why? No lie! 

It was the Day of the Dead 
Did you hear what I just said? 
Oh, oh, oh, I wouldn't put you on. 
It was the Day of the Dead, 
I tried not to lose my head. 
Oh, oh, oh, right here in BattleOn. 

The place was teaming with some creatures fighting tooth and claw 
An evil skeleton made off with my new Blade of Awe. 
I reached for the Book of Lore to see just what was going on. 
Zorbak and Deady had unleashed an evil from beyond. 

Why? No lie! 

It was the Day of the Dead 
Did you hear what I just said? 
Oh, oh, oh, I wouldn't put you on 
It was the Day of the Dead, 
I tried not to lose my head. 
Oh, oh, oh, right here in BattleOn. 

The locals tell me not to fear, 
It happens at least once a year. 
When Friday the 13th is near I fear that.... 
All the undead show up here for the gear! 

Why? No lie! 

It was the Day of the Dead 
Did you hear what I just said? 
Oh, oh, oh, I wouldn't put you on 
It was the Day of the Dead, 
I tried not to lose my head. 
Oh, oh, oh, right here in BattleOn. 

Artix, Twilly, Warlic, Cleric Joy, 
Oh, oh, oh, they help me destroy.... 

Frogzards, Wereboars, Spiders, Wolves and Slime! 
Oh oh oh, I pwn them every time! 

Watch out Drakath, you're next on my list!
