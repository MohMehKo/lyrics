Long ago when I was just a lad
The other boys hated me, said I made them mad.
I guess I didn't fit in with the norm.
I'll never know why people are so desperate to conform.
Then I remembered something that you said.
Those 9 words of yours stuck inside my head.
You said "Prince Charming, ridicule is nothing to be scared of"
So I took it as a rule.

I slipped on my finest suit.
Shined up my pirate boots.
Put a medal on my lapel.
I thought of you and gave them hell.

We're captains all and we run this show
And we only sail where we want to go.
And we live at ease doing as we please
Like pirates drifting out at sea.

All of us have weathered through a storm.
You know they say what doesn't kill you often makes you better.
We live to tell and carry on.
After all, it's nothing but a touch of nasty weather.
Some of us are still around.
You're still the dandy highway man that they're too scared to mention.
And when you board you make us proud.
It's "Admiral on deck!" and we're standing at attention.

I slipped on my finest suit.
Shined up my pirate boots.
Put a medal on my lapel.
I thought of you and gave them hell.

We're captains all and we run this show
And we only sail where we want to go.
And we live at ease doing as we please
Like pirates drifting out at sea.
That's right we're captains all, we run this show
And we only sail where we want to go.
If you have orders, oh!
Keep them to yourself 'cause the only ones we follow are our own!

As for the ones whom we adore,
Those of our friends who still are lost out in the storm.
We raise a glass to you
And leave on a light or two
In case you ever make it home
There's always room on board because...

We're captains all and we run this show
And we only sail where we want to go.
And we live at ease doing as we please
Like pirates drifting out at sea.
That's right we're captains all, we run this show
And we only sail where we want to go.
If you have orders, oh!
Keep them to yourself 'cause the only ones we follow are our own!
