All the evil in the world
Pushing down on you
And all the venom in their words
What could you do?
What kind of ignorance
Causes them to be so,
So sick and vile and evil
You did nothing to them
It's just not fair, you don't deserve it.

It's not your fault
You're innocent
It's the world that's wrong
You're innocent

When they scream and when they yell
And tear you down
They make your life a living hell
When they come 'round
There's nothing you can say
That doesn't contradict them,
'Cause all they want's a victim
On which to vent their rage
It's just not fair, you don't deserve it.

It's not your fault
You're innocent
It's the world that's wrong
You're innocent
Just hold on,
You're innocent
Some day the world will belong
To the innocent

So let's wear black,
Let's blast The Cure and Siouxsie
Then we'll go see
The Rocky Horror Picture Show
And then we'll forget to go home.

It's not your fault
You're innocent
It's the world that's wrong
You're innocent.
Just hold on,
You're innocent.
Some day the world will belong
To the innocent.
