Three heavy stones will keep it from floating,
Weigh it down to the bottom, food for the fishes.
And I know that it won't be discovered,
'cause I will be careful, so very careful.
What if it doesn't rain for days and the river is,
Reduced to its muddy bed?
With the corpse exposed, I would work in haste,
And I might bury the bones in a shallow grave.
And the rain comes and moves rocks and the stones,
Washes away all the dirt and the mud flows,
Bones are exposed and well,
You know how that goes!

I wait for the day when I finally defile,
The bodies of my ex-lover's lovers.
I'll pile high to the sky,
The bodies of my ex-lover's lovers.

Die die die die die die,
Die die die die die die die,
Watch them die. [2x]

I saw you with him. You looked so happy.
All of that can change, cause I am so lonely.
And I have lots of time to send you straight to the Devil. 
I'm taking my time,
To plan your demise.
What if I were to cut you up and mail each part
To a different town? 
It would take the most,
Brilliant private eye,
The rest of his life,
Just to put you together.
A piece in each mailbox all over the planet,
From Moscow to Tokyo to Guadalajara.

I wait for the day when I finally defile,
The bodies of my ex-lover's lovers.
I'll pile high to the sky,
The bodies of my  ex-lover's lovers.

I wait for the day when I finally destroy,
The bodies of my ex-lover's lovers.
I'll pile high to the sky,
The bodies of my ex-lover's lovers.

Die die die die die die,
Die die die die die die die,
Watch them die. [2x]

I saw you with him, you looked so happy.
That will never change because I know myself too well. 
I don't have the courage,
To carry out my dreams,
And only there will I see them,

Die die die die die die,
Die die die die die die die,
Watch them die. [x4]
