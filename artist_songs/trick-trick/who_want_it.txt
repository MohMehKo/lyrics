[Verse - Trick Trick]
We been the killas with everything
From chest wets
To death treaths
The best yet
And niggas gettin their neck check
Best check to protect
Detroit is only known know
For best threats
So bet
We got decks
And hecks
Collect debt
And rest the goon sqad
We reck your whole set
We rep the midwest
You reppin niggas get wrong
Speak on your songy songs
Sendin them home
Stone sprone
And broken bones
Better leave us the fuckk alone
Keep it runnin thru niggas
Can't even stomach what
The D got comin
Waitin until they frontin and poppin off at the chops boy
We poppin off shots
Guaranteeing a spot at the top
First place for niggas gettin guys who think you fuckkin with trick and eminem
No you not mother fucker
So next time you see us
Be sure that you make a hole
And when they mention the D
Get down on all fours

[Chorus - Trick Trick]
Got big killas with big guns (who want it)
Come to my hood
Get some (who want it)
Wanna start shit in the club boy (who want it)
Touched up (who want it)
Fucked up (who want it)
[x2]

[Verse - Eminem]
Ooh wow, look at the bitches up in this club
Man I'm gettin me some digits fo I leave up out this mug
And it's like oh pal, wam, bam, thank you ma'am
I ain't kissin you on the lips, but I'll be glad to shake your hand
Now let's get blew out, let's start some shit tonight
Just let me pick the chick that I'm a leave here with tonight
Before we get the fighting, and Throughout
This music makes me rally, how they gonna play that new trick trick
And expect no-one to get their shit spit
It's just too wild, and one more shot of hypnotic
And I am not in control of my body, I go robotic and blow a fuse out
Homies is like you're startin to static
And I'm nah that's just my swagger but I'm dancing with this fat girl
And gettin Loose now, I don't wanna fight, I feel like partying
Till' this idiot dumps his bacardi on my cardigan and knocks my screws out
It never fails, I'm know I'm going to jail
I might as well take the laces out my shoes now

[Chorus - Trick Trick]
Got big killas with big guns (who want it)
Come to my hood, get some (who want it)
Wanna start shit in the club boy (who want it)
Touched up (who want it)
Fucked up (who want it)
[x2]

[Verse - Trick Trick]
I hear them screamin
God damn it
There goes the eminem
There ain't no hittin him
That think that we just cranked up
But he been them
It's trick and them
Goon sqad gangstas
You can't get to him
We down for the bang and the brawl
But now we killin him
See ever since we started
You might of had to pardon our hardest
From the largest city
They sayin that we retarded
And ? brought us over
Some of their artists got dropped
You think I'm playin
Then bring it
Come on let's see what you got
We make the club go bang (gun shot)
You got that light noise
See ain't nobody fucking with this nigga and this white boy
That been through the realest and the pros
Street just like hoes
We put the thugs on
On him and?
We don't give a fuck about nothin you used to do
This record is not equalient to high scool musical
No blaming paul or dre
Blame me for everything I say
Cause I got him nigga

[Chorus - Trick Trick]
Got big killas with big guns (who want it)
Come to my hood, get some (who want it)
Wanna start shit in the club boy (who want it)
Touched up (who want it)
Fucked up (who want it)
