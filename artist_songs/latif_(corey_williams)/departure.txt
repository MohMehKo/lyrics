How does someone even ask
If his girl of five years has been cheating
Gettin real suspicious
Cause some things ain't addin up
Been thinking
My girl is creepin

It's obvious I did the math
From always touchin, makin love to none of that
I just wanna ball up
Cause this cloud of bad luck
Just won't seem to let up

You gon get mad at me
And just deny it all
Then I'm a get up and leave,
The Depature

I'll soon find out,
Will you confirm my fears, when I ask you oh
I'm all cried out
Cause our love just might end yea
It's gettin closer to
The departure

I been thinkin bout the times
You left our house and said you be up at your mom's
Well you doin other things
Places you ain't need to be
Laid up in another man's arms no

I been tryna keep the peace
Cause by in time eventually I'm a have see yea
Now I'm more than anxious
See the future for us
In the Valentine Tour

You gon get mad at me
And just deny it all
Then I'm a get up and leave,
The Depature

I'll soon find out,
Will you confirm my fears, when I ask you oh
I'm all cried out
Cause our love just might end yea
It's gettin closer to
The departure

(Do I wanna know) Is it true or not, is it thru or not, between you and I
(Is it just my mind) My mind playin tricks and making me crazy, lately I
(I've been down) Down just wonderin bout if you're steppin out, girl
It's hard even to look in your face not knowin are we comin or goin, needs, where to be, pardon me, honestly

I'll soon find out,
Will you confirm my fears, when I ask you oh
I'm all cried out
Cause our love just might end yea
It's gettin closer to
The departure
