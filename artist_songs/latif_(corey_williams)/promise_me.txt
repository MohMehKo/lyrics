Promise me, that you will always be my queen.
I need to know that Yeeaah
Promise me, that if I couldn't buy you things,
Like your sugar jewels - you won't care.
Promise me, that you will never leave me alone
If my records ain't hot next year.
Promise me, I've Done been with some Chicks
Before But It Wasn't Sincere
Shorty please promise me.
If you true boo, show it.
Say you going, no where.
'Cause Some Chicks Be phony
So I'm asking...

I've been with Plenty girls (Uh huh)
Baby actin' thirsty (Uh huh)
Seen me on the stage, the jewels, the feet?
They don't really care about me.
And then I met you girl, Just Like I Dreamed Youd Be.
Girl, you are my lover, my homie.
Girl, I mean honestly; can you promise me.

(Promise me)
That you won't even take it there.
Hit up the courts; want half my shares (you know)
You won't listen to your girlfriends hating.
You'll listen to me girl first please.
You'll Hold Down My Back, Girl Handle That
And if you need a stack, I'll give you that.
Once I know you got love for me,
You gon' get some things that these chicks won't see (no)

If you true boo, show it.
Say you going, no where.
'Cause Some Chicks Be phony (Uh).
So I'm asking...

I've been with Plenty girls (Uh huh)
Baby actin' thirsty (Uh huh)
Seen me on the stage, the jewels, the feet.
They don't really care about me.
And then I met you girl, Just Like I Dreamed Youd Be.
Girl, you are my lover, my homie.
Girl, I Mean honestly; can you promise me.

A man can't fall in love out here anymore(no)
Cause some girls ain't seen to what they seem to be (uh huh)
Cause they'll do anything for money.
But they ain't gettin' nothing from me.
But you seem real to me.
Can you promise me?
