Oh, listen

Monday I'll be focused, first day of the week
Wake up and start rushing, get my kiss and then leave
You call me in an hour, ask me how I made off
I'll be working late, baby don't have to wait up
And then there's Tuesday and Wednesday, I'm at it again
Grindin' it for my baby girl as hard as I can
So she can have the funny things that finally costin' her
Tell her that I love 'er and I tell her that I'll be new
Wednesday came and let's call it hump day (hump day)
Halfway through the week, hurry up
Thursday night make love to my baby
Sweet as a grudge [?]
The ups and downs, the joys, the simple things
I trust your every moment thoroughly

These are the days of our lives
(These are the days of our lives)
If you would take a care and enter my life you'd wanna deal it
(Days of our lives)
You'd get a real prospect of this love, me and my baby
(Days of our lives)
We get into it and we fuss and we fight but nothing crazy
(These are the days of our lives)
Cause after phase cool-down and your creed is really absolved
(These are the days of our lives)
There are the days, these are the lives, yea

Now every other Friday supposed to be our movie night (our movie)
But it slipped my mind, of course (it slipped my mind, of course)
After work is done, I'm calling home. Did I call you? No
Say I'm hangin' out with the boys
By the time that I got home after a long night drinking
You was angry and mad like 'what was I thinking? '
So Saturday I put in a laze and breakfast
And apologize for Friday cause I knew I neglected her
Sunday, the choir sing the perfect melody
And then a preacher came, the words of love
Just like it preached it straight to me
We, that's a regular week, when life gets in style
It's tough, well after everything, there's love, we got us
And all we ever need is love

These are the days of our lives
(These are the days of our lives)
If you would take a care and enter my life you'd wanna deal it
(Days of our lives)
You'd get a real prospect of this love, me and my baby
(Days of our lives)
We get into it and we fuss and we fight but nothing crazy
(These are the days of our lives)
Cause after phase cool-down and your creed is really absolved
(These are the days of our lives)
There are the days
These are the days of our lives

Relationships can work if you want them to
Just try to make it work
I'm talkin' when it's rough, it don't get enough
I'm so glad we have
Ups and downs, nobody's perfect
It's not about all the material things
Unconditional love is gonna make it, all worth it

Oh, days of our lives, yea
(Days of our lives)
From Monday to Sunday, from Monday, my baby
(Days of our lives)
No way, they don't wait, speedy years, hold up some time
(These are the days of our lives)
Cause we all have our ups and downs in life
(These are the days of our lives)
Days of our lives, days of our lives oh oh
(Days of our lives)
(Days of our lives)
Days of our lives, babe
