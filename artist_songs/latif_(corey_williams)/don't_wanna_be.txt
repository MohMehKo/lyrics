Might be some few errors but here it is

Baby
We spent some time apart, You Know?
Ain't even making communicating in the day
And for real what for?
(All I want is you, hope you feel it to)
It was us when you were saying, Baby Don't abandon me
Must have lost my mind.
Woke up and it hit me hard

(Damn I'm Trippin)

I've been feeling crazy
Here lately
Cause you ain't with me
We've been seperated
And I be damned if I end up like
Some people I see
(I, I hear them saying)
I wish I hadn't, shouldn't let her go.
I can't stand to end up like them
I must admit, your one I need
I don't wanna be one of those people

Listen.
What I did was wrong
And I recognized to myself
Why we broke up
It was no reason
Cause you a dime
You could finally got
Getting wanna get even
(I was trippin so bad)
I'm feeling it
(So many regrets)
So many regrets
The walls been written on
Girl, I get played on tryna act hard

I've been feeling crazy
Here lately
Cause you ain't with me
We've been seperated
And I be damned if I end up like
Some people I see
(I, I hear them saying)
I wish I hadn't, shouldn't let her go.
I can't stand to end up like them
I must admit, your one I need
I don't wanna be one of those people

And I don't wanna be
55 in the club still looking
Before it's too late for me
I'm a give this shorty all mine
Cause what you got is, my heart
I wanna make it right with you
O baby, I know, it's loving you

I've been feeling crazy
Here lately
Cause you ain't with me (Woah Woah)
We've been seperated
And I be damned if I end up like
Some people I see
(I, I hear them saying)
I wish I hadn't, shouldn't let her go.(Oo Ohh)
I can't stand to end up like them
I must admit, your one I need (Oh)
I don't wanna be one of those people

I've been feeling crazy
Here lately (Baby Yeah)
Cause you ain't (Baby Yeah) with me
We've been seperated
And I be damned if I end up like
Some people I see

I wish I hadn't, shouldn't let her go.(Shouldn't let her go)
I can't stand to end up like them (Noo)
