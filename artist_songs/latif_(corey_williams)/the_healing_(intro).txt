Wake up wake up wake up wake up, my people
Listen
It's time to say 'so long' to the Philly mentality
And time to say 'hello' to the protest music
The life music
The spiritual music
You dig?
Let's speak on the realism of life and actuality
You know?
You know uh?
Where there's promise, there's hope
Where there's faith, there's love
And where there's love, there's forgiveness
See?
They ask me 'do you represent Philly? '
And I say 'noh'
If Philly is what you see, a world star
With your favorite blog sites
And that's since I represent Philadelphia
You know?
And our cultural significance can no longer be ignored or denied
You know, let's stay clean to our originality, people
Let's bring back the feeling
I bring to you that healing
The Philadelphia healing
Love
