(Oh, yeah) (Yeah, oh woah) 

Where was you before I seized to stop. 
Sleep with it, that's how bad it was. 
You see I had a girlfriend around that time. 
But I knew it was something about you that moved something inside me and I knew. 
(Everytime) Everytime that they would mention your name, I just couldn't explain. 
(Noo) Why I felt a rush in my chest. 
Was it love, was it lust, couldn't figure what it was, girl you got a player stuck (Woah) 

Cause I was falling in love, from the top I was winning with her. 
Ain't felt that way before, soon as she would walk in the door - I was gone like a feen. 
As for my heart, asking questions to my brain, why you stalling, why you waiting here? 
When you can't let her get away cause you know that you love her, you know. 

You gotta go get the girl when you find that one. 
If you're waiting and she's staying then you're just long gone. 
When you know, let her know, when you know that its real. 
If you're blessed with the chest, to have found true love. 
Found a way, tell it stays, why don't you say it to her. 
When you know, let her know, when you know that its real. 

When you know (When you know) 
When you know (When I know) 
When you know, know, when you know. 

Something inside eventually stops. 
Like my heart felt a rush, I got stiff and my legs froze up. 
And then when I would look in your eyes, the most beautifulest thing - I gotta get you in my life (Yeah) 
The minute I go deeper inside, I'm reward cause I know I got a lot with you. 
And a whole new experience, girl I'm so serious, got me delerious. 
Baby I'm feeling you. 

Cause I was falling in love, from the top I was winning with her.

Couldn't see myself in life with no other.
