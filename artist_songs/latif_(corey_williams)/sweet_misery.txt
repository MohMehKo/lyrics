[Talking:]
Yeah whats up with you girl?(all right all right all right)
Its like i cant live wit you
and i cant live without you

[Verse 1:]
The love you give me
is kinda hard to explain
you put me soul at ease
but at the same time you treat me pains
Theres nothing funny about you baby
but you still make me laugh
We're compatible but its like we're they same

[Chorus:]
Your my sweet misery yeah
i hate to admit it
but your my everything
the love you give me
is like the perfect pain yeah
the one i hate (yeah
the one i love
the one i blame

[Verse 2:]
Your love is a dream
but at the same time you
could be like we're married
get on me last nerve
but i am lonely when your not there
you get an attittude (how you gonna get an attitude?)
when i go out at night
but when you get mad at me its all right

[Chorus]

cant live without you baby
but i cant live with you
yeah...
misery, misery
wow wow wow wow

[Chorus]

your my sweet... misery
i hate to admit it but...your my everything
the love that you give me...is like the perfect pain yeah
the one i hate
the one i love
the one i blame

everything inside of me..you got to be my sweet... misery
no doubt in my mind your give me that sweet...misery yeah
the one i hate
the one i love
the one i blame
