Oh, Oh
Let's rock wit it
Whoa, ooh, ho
Next selection

It's obvious you were made for me (Made for me...)
And believe it or not
But you're the girl of my dreams (Girl of my dreams...)
Only second to my momma
And then you come with no drama girl
So calm, like the petal of a rose
That's why I chose you
Girl you're so sweet
You make my life complete (Life complete...)
Like a sentence with a dot, dot
Girl your lovin' don't stop, stop, stop
Better yet, like a bright baguette in this cross around my neck
One day you will, but I don't think that you know it yet

You think you know, but girl you don't have no idea
How you make me feel girl when I kiss you
If you ain't here I barely I miss you
You think you know, but girl you don't have no idea
Girl, cause what I've found in you
Is all I need

Love and happiness it goes hand and hand
(Can't have one and not the other)
On your hand I put about a hundred grand
(Cause that's the rock that I bought ya)
So strong, in face
Only woman than I know that truly got my back, yeah
Cause you showed me that (You showed me that)
That's why I love you
And if tonight were the end
I would want you here with me
Cause lookin' in your eyes is the last thing I wanna see
This feels just like it did when we first met
One day you will, but I know that you don't know it yet

You think you know, but girl you don't have no idea
How you make me feel girl when I kiss you
If you ain't here I barely I miss you
You think you know, but girl you don't have no idea
Don't matter if I'm rockin' my diamonds
If you ain't here, girl I ain't shinin'

You think you know, but girl you don't have no idea
Cause I'm trying to show you how much I love you girl
Love you baby
You think you know, but girl you don't have no idea
You don't know what I found in you
Is all I need

[R-Les]
Listen girl, I ain't a man of a thousand words
But from the bread I made
Even the crumbs track a thousand birds
Now you worry bout the way I live
Cause I'm gone and I try to make it up but the way I give
Now I realize jewels ain't enough for you
Cause you're confused and it's tough for you
And the money never comforts you
And it's hard but you understand
We gotta love, that's why I hustle man
You say we never get no time alone
And could I please spend a little more time alone
And I got you baby
You gotta lot to say
And I'm gon' stop cuttin' you off
And start listenin' more starting today
I'm for real you don't know the half
Cause I don't give you enough of the love you supposed to have
But tonight baby that's gon change
I'll give you everything that I have
Just to get you heart in exchange
I'm R-Les

You think you know, but girl you don't have no idea
You think you know, but girl you don't have no idea
Oh, baby, yeah
You think you know, but girl you don't have no idea
How much I love you
You think you know, but girl you don't have no idea
How much I love you, oh
Ha, yeah
