Oh yeah
Hm, huh
Sing it, come on

Girl I trust you and all,
But I've been here before you.
You remind me of pain,
But I can't ignore you.

After I met you girl,
I tried my best not to think of you. (I tried)
Such a silly game to play,
To eventually just lose to you.

Can I get another chance to hold you tonight
Last time I left left when things were so right
Hold you girl with all of my might
Just don't let you slip away
I poured my heart out to you
From now to daylight
So you would know hurting you was never my right
I'm trying to see what's in the cards left tonight
So please except this as my plea...

I love you
I love you
I love you
Hey Hey, so don't break my heart [verse x2]

I sat and waited for my chance,
To let you know just how I feel.
I held it in for far too long.
I couldn't tell if this was real.

I never thought I'd understand,
How it feels to be hurt and to love again.
I guess it's possible for me,
That's why I let you in.

Can I get another chance to hold you tonight
Last time I left left when things were so right
Hold you girl with all of my might
And I won't let you slip away
I poured my heart out to you
From now to daylight
So you would know hurting you was never my right
I'm trying to see what's in the closet tonight
So please except this as my plea...

I love you
I love you
I love you
Hey Hey, so don't break my heart [verse x2]

Like stars in the sky
You were light of my life
That's why I love you
Just don't break my heart

Without you by my side
I was wasting my time
But now I love you
Just don't break my heart

I love you
I love you
I love you
Hey Hey, so don't break my heart [verse x2]
