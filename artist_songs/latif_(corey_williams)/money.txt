Mama come and see, she's in love with me
Au contraire, mon fr√®re
Seemed genuine when she winked at me

Money, she had her eyes on nice things
Would've done anything for money
She really didn't want love
She really got there for me or

Would've done anything for money
She really didn't want love
She really got there for me or
Money, I messed up and gave my heart
She was too greedy for a little bit
Shorty had to have it all
Money, yea money, oh money, oh money, money

Money, she had her eyes on nice things
Would've done anything for money
She really didn't want love

Money, I messed up and gave my heart
She was too greedy for a little bit

Money, yea money, oh money, oh money, money

She loved herself
That's how money deceived her, yea
Money's the root of all evil
