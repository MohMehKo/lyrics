Three weeks, and no speaking for me to see;
I was wrong. 
Playing back in my head the things I said to you, 
Girl I went too far. 
When you yelled “I’m leaving”,
Fine! But you’re bluffing. 
Been weeks still you ain’t returned my call.
I stayed up every night, I couldn’t sleep
Cause you ain’t here. 
Wrote crazy longs texts, apologies, 
But my pride wouldn’t press send. 
I took for granted your love, 
See this, what I get is too much, 
Cause you’re gone.

Can I get one kiss?

One kiss,
It’ll make this right, 
Know that you feel it;
“I still love you”, 
from how I kiss your lips. 
Because me telling you, 
Don’t seem to work.
So I guess I gotta show you
That’s why I ask, for one kiss, girl!

Looking so lost, of course, 
Cause I ain’t got my queen.
Be feeling on my chest,
I left my sweat feels like my heart won’t beat. 
Nowhere else can I find a girl
That’s more perfect..
See I’m hurting like this
Cause I deserve it. 
Every day no sun, 
Guess you took that, huh? 
Just rain here. 
I just can’t give up, 
You mean way too much to me, baby. 
I promise I will cherish your love.
See I wanna change girl, for us.
What I wish? That you give me one kiss. 

One kiss,
It’ll make this right, 
Know that you feel it;
“I still love you”, from how I kiss your lips. 
Because me telling you, 
Don’t seem to work.
So I guess I gotta show you
That’s why I ask, for one kiss, girl!

One kiss,
It’ll make this right, 
Know that you feel it;
“I still love you”, from how I kiss your lips. 
Because me telling you, 
Don’t seem to work.
So I guess I gotta show you
That’s why I ask, for one kiss, girl!

Just one kiss, one kiss.
I’m so sick, my swags off, 
My girl’s gone, everybody’s noticing. 
One kiss, one kiss.
Got me on punishment, 
On the count of one I did. 
See I wouldn’t listen, NO!
Or give you that attention, 
It’s my fault. 
I want it like that, not this, 
Like that, not this…
Let’s start it with one kiss.

One kiss,
It’ll make this right, 
Know that you feel it;
“I still love you”, from how I kiss your lips. 
Because me telling you, 
Don’t seem to work.
So I guess I gotta show you
That’s why I ask, for one kiss, girl!
