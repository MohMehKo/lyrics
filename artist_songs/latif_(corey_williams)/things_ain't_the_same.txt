True
I'm singin' to you my baby
True
I'm singin' to you my baby, yeah
Singin' to you my baby, yeah
Yeah

Call it stupidity
Or a casualty of young love
I had no right to be
Your man, still playin'
You gave your heart to me
And I dragged it all through the mud
To think you thought of me
As someone you trust

I'm feelin' pitiful
Cause you're so beautiful
You are my ride or die
How can I let you go

I need to know what can I do
I swear that I'll be good to you
Give me the chance

[Chorus]
So I thought if I just told her a lie
She wouldn't walk away
She wouldn't say bye-bye
I really love her but I hurt her a lot
It's sad I played the game
Now things ain't the same with us

You might be missin' me
Or maybe don't give a damn
I understand you know
Right now, I stand heart broke and guilty, girl
A sad state of affairs
I seen your picture but you're really not there

I'm feelin' pitiful
Cause you're so beautiful
You are my ride or die
How can I let you go

I need to know what can I do
I swear that I'll be good to you
Give me the chance

[Chorus]
So I thought if I just told her a lie
She wouldn't walk away
She wouldn't say bye-bye
I really love her but I hurt her a lot
It's sad I played the game
Now things ain't the same with us

Us, with us, with us, with us
Now things ain't the same with us
Us, with us, with us, with us
Now things ain't the same with us
Us, with us, with us, with us
Oh, oh
Now things ain't the same with us
Us, with us, with us, with us
Now things ain't the same with us

Where we ready to, to end like this,
Relationship, I don't why
Let it spin, spin it down
I've been thinking about
The things that I said and did
I shouldn't have done it
Cause now things just ain't the same
Oh Nothing than you can say

[Chorus]
So I thought if I just told her a lie
She wouldn't walk away
She wouldn't say bye-bye
I really love her but I hurt her a lot
It's sad I played the game
Now things ain't the same with us

Us, with us, with us, with us
Now things ain't the same with us
Us, with us, with us, with us
Now things ain't the same with us
Us, with us, with us, with us
Oh, oh
Now things ain't the same with us
Us, with us, with us, with us
Now things ain't the same with us
