Listen
I'm not trying to say I don't trust you and all that
But sometimes, you know
I got thoughts, my mind can roam wild
I can trip sometimes, you know
And in order for me not to go that raller
Ask those questions
You feel me?
Listen

Riddle me this, what you care about?
How I would feel if you'd start givin' your dump around
I started talkin' to your ex
I hit him with responses to the texts (can I trust you too?)
Or think twice, then you double back?
Though you arouse there ain't no cause in my loosing that
I'm true to you and you're true to me
Sometimes I ask myself 'are they what they seem? '
Girl, I'm tryna see how strong is his love
Not as strong as our love so I (so I ask you these questions)
Just fuck the conversation, get confirmation why we trust
(So I ask you these questions)

There'll be no doubt between us, girl no secrets
Some questions I'm a ask to keep my mind from wondering
Questions

Now it's your turn to ask the questions
No, I don't mind confessin' anything you wanna know
And I ain't even gotta lie
Cause I'm bulletproof with money to comparison before you saw
And no, don't start, I don't mean between
Cause then girl you'd have made me a better man
I'm true to you, say you are true to me
Wanna be sure things are what seem, oh

I wanna see, girl how strong is this love?
As strong as this love song (so I ask you these questions)
To get the confirmation, more conversation
Why I trust you girl?
(So I ask you these questions)

There'll be no doubt between us, girl no secrets
Some questions I'm a ask to keep my mind from wondering
Questions

The reasons why I ask you questions (yea, questions)
Is to clear my mind
Cause baby, the suspicion alone can make you go crazy
I'm human and you know that in my rooms
Sometimes I wonder where you are when you're not home
So I ask you these questions, questions, yea

I wanna see, girl how strong is this love?
As strong as this love song (so I ask you these questions)
Just book the conversation, get confirmation
Why we trust?
(So I ask you these questions)

There'll be no doubt between us, girl no secrets
Some questions I'm a ask to keep my mind from wondering
