You're hotter than, all your friends
Looking good, do your thing
I couldn't pass ya, had to ask ya
Did you get it from your mama

None could tie the shoes on you girl
I'm not gaming so don't get me wrong
There's something I think you should know

Are you the one
You're just something I'm tryna get with tonight
But I want
Nothing serious, tell me are you feeling this
I'll take you home
Uh, huh, bet that shorty wanna ride with me
So put me on, girl
Put me on, ma

Hey, hey

Been sweatin you all damn night
And baby
The way you shake it on the floor
Plus that dress fittin you so right
Hey, hey
So won't you give me a chance
Cuz I'm not thinking bout those other guys
So, slide your body next to mine
Baby won't you put me on

We could shake the spot
You and me
This is where I'm tryna be
This pool is callin, for your body
Mixing Crissy, with Bacardi
You can leave the keys with your friends
Just come and take a ride in my Benz

There's something I think you should know

Are you the one
Or are you just something I'm tryna get with tonight
