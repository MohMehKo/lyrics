I gotta let her know
Damn, damn, damn
I gotta let her know
I gotta let her know
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Gotta let her know
Let's go

Tryna act like it don't faze me
But on the real I know it do
It don't feel the same
I can't let it go
Cause on the real I'm missing you
And all I really wanna do is get it tight again
Makin' everything like it was
We rolled to the club before they know bout us
Never thought that it would get to me the way that it does

Gotta dust it off and keep it movin'
Got me feelin' like I'm bout to lose it
But somehow, gotta get through this
But you know it's killin' me girl

Gotta dust it off and keep it movin'
Got me feelin' like I'm bout to lose it
I hurt my girl, I'm so sorry
But you know it's killin' me girl

Girl I said I know
I know was shady
What I did was wrong
Lord knows that I miss my baby
You finally got somebody
While I'm wishing that I woulda never played myself
Said all my pictures you threw away
Damn, never again wanna see my face
I said I never felt like this
And it hurts my baby, I done lost my baby

Gotta dust it off and keep it movin'
Got me feelin' like I'm bout to lose it
But somehow, gotta get through this
But you know it's killin' me girl

Gotta dust it off and keep it movin'
Got me feelin' like I'm bout to lose it
Girl I broke your heart, and I'm sorry, baby
But you know it's killin' me girl

Yo break it down
Gotta let her know
Oh, I miss you baby
Gotta let her know
Oh I miss you baby
Gotta let her know

Gotta dust it off and keep it movin'
Got me feelin' like I'm bout to lose it
But somehow, gotta get through this
But you know it's killin' me girl

Gotta dust it off and keep it movin'
Got me feelin' like I'm bout to lose it
