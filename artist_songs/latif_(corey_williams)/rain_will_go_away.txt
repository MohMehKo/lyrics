Ohhh yeah
Ohhh yeah
Ohhh
Ohhh
Na na na, na na

Now that we called it quits
I can't cease to remember the things I missed
Two years ago I wouldn'tve dreamed we'd end like this
To young to understand what love is
I wish I could've stayed another day
But in the end things simply weren't the same
I thought some day that you might share my name
We grew apart
I know it broke your heart
But the rain

Rain will go away
(Rain will go away)
I pray you find someone to take my place
(You will find love someday) Clouds will go away
(Clouds will go away)
And the sun and the moon and the stars will shine again
(Sun will shine again)

Darling yeah
When it began we were such best friends
Life was such a fairy tale, intense
Together we drank to lose our innocence
Gave in to each other, we were heaven sent
Now all in all I really can't complain
Though the memories that linger often bring me pain
I found in life you have to lose to gain
But never fear, you will love again

Rain will go away
(Rain will go away)
I pray you find someone to take my place
(You will find love someday) Clouds will go away
(Clouds will go away)
And the sun and the moon and the stars will shine again
(Sun will shine again)

Everything has its season
But I cry sometimes
For no reason
You were my first love
And I hope that you find what you dream of

Rain will go away
(Rain will go away)
I pray you find someone to take my place
(You will find love someday) Clouds will go away
(Clouds will go away)
And the sun and the moon and the stars will shine again
(Sun will shine again)

I cry sometimes
I don't know why
You'll find somebody baby
Somebody for you
Yes you will
Ohhh

I'm sorry baby

Rain will go away
You'll find love someday
Clouds will go away
Sun will shine again
