I couldn't even blink no think no 
Cause I was dumb struck when I met you 
I had given up on love, last girl did me in 
Lost all hope that I'd ever love again 
Everything change when the wind blow 
The meaning of life you made it simple 
You helped me trust again, the missing things I found in you 

Girl the possibilities are endless now, 
Hearts combined can tap into a treasure 
It's unfound with you girl, crazy love 
Must be love, crazy love, 
Girl you're taking my heart in a whirl wind 
Emotions so deep like an ocean, crazy love 
Must be love, crazy love, 
Girl you saved my soul from sinking 
My dreams came true in an instant 
My crazy love, oh, oh, oh, oh, 

The end of the world couldn't phase me 
Cause you are my sun, my baby 
Compassionate, you never hold back (no) 
I'm fortunate girl for what I have 
The softest kiss is with an angel's words 
Forget the past now I'm with you girl 
Words missing I found in you 

Girl the possibilities are endless now, 
Hearts combined can tap into a treasure 
It's unfound with you girl, 
Must be love, crazy love, 
Girl you're taking my heart in a whirlwind 
Emotions so deep like an ocean, crazy love 
Must be love, crazy love, 
Girl you saved my soul from sinking 
My dreams came true in an instant 
My crazy love, oh, oh, oh, oh, 

My heart is in a whirl wind spinning out hard 
Emotion that I could swim in, deep as our love 
Me and my baby, our love's crazy 
You turned my world around made it better it showing 
Life is so beautiful but before you ain't know it 
My baby, our love's crazy, whoa 

Must be love, crazy love 
Girl you're taking my heart in a whirl wind 
Emotions so deep like an ocean, crazy love 
Must be love, crazy love, 
Girl you saved my soul from sinking 
My dreams came true in an instant 
My crazy love, my crazy love, 
My crazy love, my crazy love 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
