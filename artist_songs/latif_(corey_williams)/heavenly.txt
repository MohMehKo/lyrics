Girl right now, now where I wanna be
Not at the club later maybe till three

When it comes to makin love you got the recipe
You sprinkle a little this, and a little bit of that
You got the kinda of love that makes a brother come back
So throw your cares to the wind baby
Cuz tonight is your night

Tonight I'm gonna do things differently
I'm gonna come home and take care of you
And do the special things that lovers do

Rollin late night chillin with my friends
