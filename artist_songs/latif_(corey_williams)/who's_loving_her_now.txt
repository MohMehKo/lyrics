This is real
This is how I feel baby
Check it

She was the kind of girl that I wanted
She was like my homie, my best friend
If there was one girl perfect in this world
It would have to be her
She was the kind of girl that I needed
She was off the chain and I mean it
I swear that she was too good to be true
But she love the ground I walk on
In her eyes, I could do no wrong to her
But somewhere along the lines, started feelin' myself
And I got all into her
But then one day I went too far, and didn't check myself
And I ended up losin her
But now I'm all by myself, and I can't help myself
Wondering who's loving her

Who's loving her now
Is he treatin' her right
Is he keepin' her satisfied
Who's touchin her now
Is he givin her something she can feel
Oh, I wanna know
Who's loving her now
Holdin' it down, turning her world all around
Who gettin what I've been missin
Who's givin her what I wasn't giving

Now I always said real niggas don't trip
So I hopped in my whip, and jumped on the strip
Cuz I knew if I really needed someone
The girls are lining up
I pick three and I go home
But know matter how many I love
I can't help but wonder if
My girl's alone, can somebody tell me

Who's loving her now
Is he treatin' her right
Is he keepin' her satisfied
Who's touchin her now
Is he givin her something she can feel
I know I'm young but I wanna know
Who's loving her now
Holdin' it down, turning her world all around
Who gettin what I've been missin
Who's givin her what I wasn't giving

I was a playa and that was how I was living, yeah
I know I was out there trickin baby
Taking but never givin lady
So many girls will come and go
But no one would ever come close to her
Nobody compares

I ran into her sister the other day
She said she moved out to L.A. to start again
Said that she was doing fine, everything is alright
Since she got away from me
Now she was doin better
And better than ever and never would she come back
I said yeah, yeah I learned my lesson
But will you please answer one question

Who's loving her now
Is he treatin' her right
(Is he treatin her right)
Is he keepin' her satisfied
(Lovin her now)
Who's touchin her now
Is he givin her something she can feel
(Feelin on my baby)
Oh, I wanna know
Who's loving her now
Holdin' it down, turning her world all around
