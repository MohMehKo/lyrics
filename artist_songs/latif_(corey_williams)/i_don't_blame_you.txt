La la la la la la
Yo, baby you alright?
Oh yeah
Come here let me talk to you for a second
(Ooh)
I know, I know, I know
Let me make you feel better
(Oh, ga ga ga ga ga ga baby)
Just talk to me
I'll never know unless you open up and talk to me
(I can tell something's wrong)
(Baby I can tell something's wrong)
I'm always here, believe me

Say what's the matter baby
There's something heavily weighing your mind
How about a conversation
I intend to ease your worries tonight
Please don't hold back your emotions
It pains me to see you hold feelings inside
I know you won't let it break yet
And you'll be okay if you give love a try

Girl you gave your heart
But that brother never cared
Thinking to yourself you wish
You wouldn't have gone there
Afraid to love again
Thinking all men are the same
Girl I don't blame you
Girl you gave your heart
But that brother never cared
Thinking to yourself you wish
You wouldn't have gone there
Afraid to love again
Thinking all men are the same
Girl I don't blame you

I know for certain you're hurting baby
You won't feel love that's real
Without ample time to heal
Learning to trust without fear
And to move beyond the past and your tears
No memories remain
The heartaches, the pain
They seem to never, ever, ever go away
Just let me know when you're ready baby
To forever be my lady, my lady

Girl you gave your heart
But that brother never cared
Thinking to yourself you wish
You wouldn't have gone there
Afraid to love again
Thinking all men are the same
Girl I don't blame you
Girl you gave your heart
But that brother never cared
Thinking to yourself you wish
You wouldn't have gone there
Afraid to love again
Thinking all men are the same
Girl I don't blame you

(Take a chance on love)
Girl you gave your heart
But that brother never cared
(Once again you'll find romance, my love)
Thinking to yourself you wish
You wouldn't have gone there
Afraid to love again
Thinking all men are the same
Girl I don't blame you
