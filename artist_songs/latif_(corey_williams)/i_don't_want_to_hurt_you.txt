Baby, you know you mean the world to me.
That's why I can't keep you in this situation,
Where I can hurt you.
Can I talk to you?

[Verse 1]

First of all 
I wanna tell you that all I do is have 
love for you (Love for you)
No matter we go our seperate ways I still 
ride for you (ride for you)

Cause you’re the truth (cause you’re the truth)
Can't be replaced (can't be replaced)
You’re the type of girl to make a nigga go out and get the ring. 
But the problem is, I'm not positive that I can give 
the commitment that you're asking for.

Cause right now I'm young and though you're the one. 
I can't guarantee that I can be the one you want.
You want someone who is faithful.
I'm not admitting I can't do it; just don't wanna put you through it.

If I may happen to see one,
She may holler I may holler, but I wouldn't wanna do that to you.

[Chorus]

Girl I feel that I'll be cheatin' you
If I continue to see you
Cause you're ready to get serious,
I'm not cause I'm still curious

I'd rather keep it real,
than tell you how I feel.
Cause I think you're beautiful,
and I don't want to hurt ya, no.

[Verse 2]
See over and over again I keep on sayin’ to myself 
I must be goin' out my mind to not wanna spend all my time with her.
Cause I love ya more than to game your heart.

Cause I know that I'm not ready, 
To lock it down full time,
Settle down with one dime,
spend the rest of my life with you.

It's better to cry now then to hate me later
Trust me, I've had a broken heart before.
And I know just how it feels,
And know in time it will...
In time it will reveal, if our love is real.

[Chorus x2]

Girl I feel that I'll be cheatin' you
If I continue to see you
Cause you're ready to get serious,
I'm not cause I'm still curious

I'd rather keep it real,
And tell you how I feel.
Cause I think you're beautiful,
and I don't want to hurt ya, no.

[Break]

Trust me girl, I never wanted to, I never wanted to hurt you.

Trust me girl, I never wanted to, I never wanted to hurt you.

No, no, no, no...

No, yeah

[Chorus]

Girl I feel that I'll be cheatin' you
If I continue to see you
Cause you're ready to get serious,
I'm not cause I'm still curious

I'd rather keep it real,
than tell you how I feel.
Cause I think you're beautiful,
and I don't want to hurt ya, no.

Girl I feel that I'll be cheatin' you
If I continue to see you
Cause you're ready to get serious,
I'm not cause I'm still curious

If I do baby, don't tell you the truth. 
It would only hurt you later, later.

Girl I feel that I'll be cheatin' you
If I continue to see you
Cause you're ready to get serious,
I'm not cause I'm still curious
