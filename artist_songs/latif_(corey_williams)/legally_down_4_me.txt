There were many dimes in the place
That's what I thought till I saw your face
Next thing you know, we're dancing close
Grindin' slow, hands upon your waist
I can hear her clear, whisper in my ear
Talkin' bout how she wanted to leave
Yo I was diggin' her, right
She was feelin' me, of course
I had to see her ID before we leave

Said I'm looking for a shorty, got her act right
Gotta be at least 18 for me to wife that
If you're young and you're down for me
Holla back when you turn 18

Said I'm looking for a shorty, got her act right
Gotta be at least 18 for me to wife that
If you're young and you're down for me
Holla back when you turn 18
Holla back

Girl I'll give you whatever
Got your own that's even better
Baby please, before we leave
Can I see ID, gotta see that before we leave
Just one night no commitment
I won't look at you no different
It's cool with me, I know your stee
Girl you're a freak, it's cool with me

[R. Les]
Yeah, it's cool if you wanna be down with me
You wanna roll with R. Les â€˜cause I made this beat
And that's fine, but 18 is where I draw the line
Holla in a couple years, I'll give you half what's mine
And that's if I haven't already found my wife
You know my life
City nights, fast cars, and bikes
Porcelain tubs, love on Persian rugs
You're too young, yet to understand my thug
Still I hope you ain't out for ones
For the songs I sung that you heard on Radio One
This is all how rumors begun
Cause they see us talking
And they be talking about you havin' my son
I'm good, it's okay, we can't talk or touch
Still you got thighs, two eyes, any man might lust
Got a smile like a high school crush
Girl you're too much
Here's an autograph and hug enjoy that

Got be at least 18

Girl I'll give you whatever
Got your own that's even better
Baby please, before we leave
Can I see ID, gotta see that before we leave
Just one night no commitment
I won't look at you no different
It's cool with me, I know your stee

Sneakin' in the club, tryna drink
Hah
It's Next Selection
It's ain't knocking you out for trying
Just wait baby
Wait baby
