Baby
This is Latif
And I wanted to tell you
How much you mean to me
This year
Starts the rest of our lives
Together
Yeah

I was just a lonely man
Livin' in a lonely world
Lookin' for that special girl
Then here comes you
Never thought I'd settle down
But I know I'm ready now
So girl let's go exchange these vows
While we young

Ooh, I promise
Girl I promise I'll be true, true to you
To have and hold to cherish you, cherish you
From this day forth I'll be yours, and you'll be mine
Only God about could break us up
We'll be together always

Last year
I was looking for a woman that's right
This year
Girl we walking down the aisle in all white
It makes me so proud just to say it
I realize girl that we made it
Last year
I was just a lonely man
This year
Now I've found love again
This year, baby
I'm so glad that you're here

Though we're lovers we're the best of friends
A fairy tale and not pretend
I never want this love to end, oh no
I could never leave you baby
One day you're gonna have my baby
And we gon' raise our family
Together, I'm so glad you're here

Girl I promise I'll be true, true to you
To have and hold to cherish you, cherish you
From this day forth I'll be yours, and you'll be mine
Only God above could break us up
We'll be together always
