Turn it up

Stop searchin'
You're perfect
Don't let nobody lie to you
Say you need the truth
You're perfect
You're worth it
Don't let nobody lie to you
Say you need the truth
Stop searchin'

I've gotta guess you
Baby girl you are flawless for guys that make you look good in the morning
Even get with insecure guys in the past
But try to light their confidence what they ain't have
See, I wanna build you up
I'll love unconditional
When I see a beautiful, I start to fade
I gotta say something
Stop chasin', chasin'

Tryna get these implants all these chicks got
Shoes gotta be red, bottom to the aim high
These are lies lies and lies and lies, girl sighs
Beauty is within, queen, listen to these words

Tryna get these implants all these chicks got
Shoes gotta be red, bottom to the aim high
Lies lies and lies and lies, girl trust
The beauty is within, queen, listen to these words

Stop searchin'
You're perfect
Don't let nobody lie to you
Say you need the truth
You're perfect
You're worth it
Don't let nobody lie to you
Say you need the truth
Stop searchin'

The product of love that you just really wanted
So easily you fell for the wolf in sheep's clothing
Put his hands on you, never call the cops
You wanna leave but he always stops you
You deserve much better than that
Sad when I see my sisters settlin' down
Listen, this is not the way that you should have to leave, noo

She's talkin' tears, I can't cover up
The scars and the bruises, that's never love
Lies lies and lies and lies, girl trust
The beauty is within, queen, listen to these words

She's talkin' tears, I can't cover up
The scars and the bruises, that's never love
Lies lies and lies and lies, girl trust
The beauty is within, queen, listen to these words

Stop searchin'
You're perfect
Don't let nobody lie to you
Say you need the truth
You're perfect
You're worth it (and you're worth it)
Don't let nobody lie to you
Say you need the truth
Stop searchin'

If I gotta tell the world, I will
Let's love our women, help 'em all to hell
Every mother, every daughter, every sister, give'em love
Tell them that they're perfect and got progress
Oh baby, stop searchin'

Stop searchin'
You're perfect
Don't let nobody lie to you
Say you need the truth
You're perfect
You're worth it
Don't let nobody lie to you
Say you need the truth
Stop searchin'
