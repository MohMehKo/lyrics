Do do do do do

I keep tellin myself it's all a lie
Until something made me realize
You're the best thing that happened to me
You're my pride and joy and destiny
Girl you know I love my music first
Don't be calling getting on my nerves
(I ain't tryna hear that)
Cuz what's best for me is best for her
I wanna give you girl what you deserve

I don't mind spending time
Girl you know the bottom line
Gotta go, I can't stay
Can't let love get in the way
On the road night and day
Maybe later we could play
Bottom line, I can't stay
Can't let love get in the way

Out of months of being out of town
I popped up in your door unannounced
Hoping that I wouldn't have seen the worst
If shorty messing round, getting hurt
But the outcome was so beautiful
She was cooking something in her robe
(Um hmm, it smelled so good)
She was sexy as she wanted to be
She's my baby girl my everything

I don't mind spending time
Girl you know the bottom line
Gotta go, I can't stay
Can't let love get in the way
On the road night and day
Maybe later we could play
Bottom line, I can't stay
Can't let love get in the way

Baby, listen, let me talk to you girl
Maybe later we could play
(But right now)
Can't let love get in the way
(I gotta go)
Girl I wish that I could stay
Gotta go baby I can't stay
Maybe later we could play
Can't let love get in the way
Girl I wish that I could stay
Gotta go baby I can't stay
Say baby I don't mind

I don't mind spending time
Girl you know the bottom line
Gotta go, I can't stay
Can't let love get in the way
On the road night and day
Maybe later we could play
Bottom line, I can't stay
Can't let love get in the way

Baby let me tell you something
You know what I gotta do girl
I'm always on the road
Oh, yeah
I said I get lonely baby
Oh, said I get lonely and I
I'm laying by myself
Cuz I know I gotta treat my baby right
