Uhhh, uhhh
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Ha ha ha ha
Check it
Was it the first
Was it?
It's not?
Oh, okay
Oh, yeah

I don't believe in a fairy tale love
But always thought that it could be us
We spent some time together
Started growing together
Through bad stuff we weathered together baby
You know I'll always love you, uh, yeah
Cause real love don't go away
I'll do whatever I need to do to please you
Because I need you baby

We talk and talk
The outcomes still the same
You won't stop
You gotta complain baby and I
Tossing and turning every night
Can't sleep
So if you think it's alright

If you thinking that every thing is fine
I'm gonna let you know baby right now that it's not
Now I know you can see that I'm hurting inside
If you like me say yes and if not it's alright
I'm gonna say it again
If you thinking that every thing is fine
I'm gonna let you know baby right now that it's not
Now I know you can see that I'm hurting inside
If you like me say yes and if not it's alright

Oh
Things ain't always been bad, oh no
And I keep thinking about the love that we had, yeah
I wanna hold you and wanna love you
You never listen baby all you do is argue
You get jealous when I hang with my friends
I get home late and then the drama begins
What's a man to do
Girl you put me through
More than I could ever have to words to express
Said we

We talk and talk
The outcomes still the same
You won't stop
You gotta complain
Tossing and turning every night
Can't sleep
You know it ain't right

If you thinking that everything is fine
I'm gonna let you know baby right now that it's not
Now I know you can see that I'm hurting inside
If you like me say yes and if not it's alright
It's not baby
If you thinking that every thing is fine
I'm gonna let you know baby right now that it's not
Now I know you can see that I'm hurting inside
If you like me say yes and if not it's alright

It's alright
Baby it's alright if you gotta leave me
Just let me down easy
It's alright
It's alright but you gotta tell me
If love ain't a two way street
It's alright
Love is supposed to make you feel happy
And make you feel complete
It's alright
So sort it out baby
Gotta let me know because I
Love to, love to love you

If you thinking that everything is fine
(If you think for a moment)
I'm gonna let you know baby right now that it's not
(No it's not alright baby)
Now I know you can see that I'm hurting inside
(Inside)
If you like me say yes and if not it's alright
(Inside I cry)
If you thinking that every thing is fine
(Oh whoa baby)
I'm gonna let you know baby right now that it's not
(Oh no no)
Now I know you can see that I'm hurting inside
(Say it again)
If you like me say yes and if not it's alright

Oh, baby
Yeah

Alright baby
