I remember that day
You told me that yo mamma
Was taking you away
That he put her through some drama
Tears came to my eyes
Really didn't wanna cry
But it hurt so bad on the inside

Tell me how can this be,
That you're not here with me
And I can't do nothin' 'bout it
I'm only nineteen
Since the day you left me lonely
My life has not been the same

Nothin' but cloudy days (Without you)
My sunshine turned to rain (Without you)
My life is not the same (Without you)
Just heartache and pain (Without you)
Everything I do (Is for you)
And every word I say (Is true)
My mission on this earth is to please you
Anything you say I'll do
Can't live without you

Now you're in another state
I'm writing you this letter
With a picture and a frame
Lying on the dresser
Baby come home to me
It's your arms that I need
Need your kissin' and your huggin'
Rubbin' and your touchin'
Girl I need your lovin'
Cuz my body's callin you(you)

Nothin but cloudy days (Without you)
My sunshine turned to rain (Without you)
My life is not the same (Without you)
Just heartache and pain (Without you)
Everything I do (Is for you)
And every word I say (Is true)
My mission on this earth is to please you
Anything you say I'll do
Can't live without you

I'm talkin bout your warm embrace
I'm talkin bout your pretty face
Ohh how your kisses taste
Missin her touch
I'm talkin bout my babygirl
She used to be my whole world
But now she's not here
What am I to do...

Nothin but cloudy days (Without you)
My sunshine turned to rain (Without you)
My life is not the same (Without you)
Just heartache and pain (Without you)
Everything I do (Is for you)
And every word I say (Is true)
My mission on this earth is to please you
Anything you say I'll do
Can't live without you

My mission on this earth is to be with you
What am I to do

I remember that day
You told me that yo mamma
Was taking you away
That he put her through some drama
Tears came to my eyes
Really didn't wanna cry

(repeat) Nothin but cloudy days (Without you)
My sunshine turned to rain (Without you)
My life is not the same (Without you)
Just heartache and pain (Without you)
Everything I do (Is for you)
And every word I say (Is true)
My mission on this earth is to please you
Anything you say I'll do
Can't live without you
