Yo
When two people get together
To love each other
That's the most beautifulest thing in the world

Girl
Across the skies by the dawn's early light
Words can't describe how you write in my mind
Oh yeah
If it means I got you by my side
I'll do anything for your love

Hey girl
Do you have dreams like I do
Passionate scenes that involve me and you
By candlelight in the dark it's so cool
When were in a groove
We can work it out
Take a walk on the beach with you
Skinny dippin by the pool
Got a bottle, yes we do
And there's nothing no
Even read you poetry
Cause you're so heavenly
You're the greatest thing I could ever do
That's why I cry

Across the skies by the dawn's early light
Words can't describe how you write in my mind
Oh yeah
If it means I got you by my side
I'll do anything for your love

Hey girl
Get everything you deserve
I can believe in you than have the nerve
Everyone knows your love is perfect, yeah
Baby and that's my word on everything I love
Take a walk on the beach with you
Skinny dippin by the pool
Got a bottle, yes we do
And there's nothing, no
Even read you poetry
Cause you're so heavenly
You're the greatest thing I could ever do
That's why I cry

Across the skies by the dawn's early light
Words can't describe how you write in my mind
Oh yeah
If it means I got you by my side
I'll do anything for your love

Said I'm glad this day has finally come
Cause now you and I are one
Combined and share this love
Baby down don't need to be around with you and me
Cause you're my everything
Oh girl

Across the skies right under the light
Word can't describe how you write in my mind, oh yeah
If it means I got you by my side
I'll do anything for your love

Said I love you baby
And I feel so sure
You're the girl that my heart was made for
Never had a kind of love so pure
Baby
Girl you're accompanied in all of my dreams
Baby baby what this means (What does it mean)
I'll do anything (I'll do anything)
