Girl you got me wanting to give you some
Hold up

Straight out of a movie
I just really think it's wicked
How you move your body sicken
I ain't even shy with it
I'm tryna slide up with you, got me
Wanting to take you home
I'm in the pearl x5, sittin right outside
Tell me, are you here alone
I can tell that you with it
If you with it, I can get it, come on

Body bangin like what

Girl

Girl

Let me see you shake it
I know inside you naked
Girl don't make me take it
Come here, let me tell you

Let me know just what you sippin
I'm make sure you be gettin it cuz
If you get tipsy then I know
What the evening looks like
Take it easy with it
I don't want you to just pass out
Till you get home to my house
Then we can both just pass out

Tell just what you want
Want to dip but you shy

Say girl, I won't hurt you, no
Girl you liking what you see
And I'm liking what I see, so come on
