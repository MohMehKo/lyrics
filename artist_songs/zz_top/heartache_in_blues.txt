Yeah
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Cmon
I got it bad
Yeah so bad
I don't never want it no more
Baby
If it were me
You left me layin down on the floor

Only you (only you)
Yeah yeah you (yeah yeah you)
You left me left my heartache in blue

Well when you're good
Don't mean no good
Leavin my mind in a tangle
And that's the way
That's what I say
I'm crumblin all around and a wrangle

Sweet you (sweet you)
Sweet sweet you (sweet sweet you)
You left me left my heartache in blue

Oh well
You demon hair?
Slitherin down a blue red door
Chang chang
It's just a thang
Tie me up then keep me just until I'm gone
Only you (only you)
Sweet sweet you (sweet sweet you)
You left me left my heartache in blue
