I DROPPED OUT OF SOCIETY
FELL BY THE WAYSIDE SO TO SPEAK
QUIT MY JOB I'M A LAZY SLOB
NEVER LIFT A FINGER 'CEPT FOR MY HEART THROB

I'M A SINPUSHER, HANGIN' ON THE ON THE "DL" DOWN LOW
JUST A SINPUSHER, KINDA LIKE HEAVEN OR HELL

I WANT A BIT OF EVERYTHING
I'M WANTED BY THE LAW
I JUST WANT A LITTLE BIT
I GUESS I WANT IT ALL

I'M A SINPUSHER, HANGIN' ON THE ON THE "DL" DOWN LOW
I'M JUST A SINPUSHER, KINDA LIKE HEAVEN OR HELL 

I LIKE MY BIG FAT BACK
I LIKE MY YA YA THIN
I LIKE TO PUSH IT DOWN
INTO THE LAND OF SIN

I'M A SINPUSHER, HANGIN' ON THE ON THE D.L., DOWN LOW
I'M A SINPUSHER, KINDA LIKE HEAVEN OR HELL
