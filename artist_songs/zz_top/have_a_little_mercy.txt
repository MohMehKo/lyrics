Have a little mercy
I want my baby back
Have a little mercy
Or give me cadialine
Have mercy miss Percy
Give me pa dozza back

Have mercy
Love me like a Big Rolls Royce
Have mercy
Love me like there ain't no choice
Have mercy miss Percy
Shucks, I'm gonna just cook somethin for ya.

[Solo]

Have a little mercy
I feel like diamonds and pearls
Have a little mercy
I feel like diamonds and pearls
Have mercy miss Percy
You're driving me out of this world

Well if you will have a little mercy
You have the time.
Have a little mercy
Have mercy
'Coz you're mine all mine
