Draggin a Mustang 69
Top dropped back and lookin fine
Workin a brew backin up with scotch
Lookin like Sir Lancelot
What it is brother
What it is kid
Rock it like a mother
What it is

Lookin suave I need to shave
But I ain't ready to behave
And it ain't bad on the other hand
Detroit rocks like the Rio Grande
What it is brother
What it is kid
Rock it like a mother
What it is

What it is
What it is
What it is
What it is
What it is, what it is
