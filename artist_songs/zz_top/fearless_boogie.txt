CALL ME A PRETTY BOY
THEY CALL ME A SAINT
THEY CALL ME A SINNER
IT'S GONNA BE THE SAME
NOW I'M NOT AFRAID
AND I'M NOT AFEARED
I AIN'T GONNA LOSE IT
AND I'M NOT SCARED

TO DO THE FEARLESS BOOGIE
TO DO THE FEARLESS BOOGIE
SMOKIN' FEARLESS BOOGIE
UNTIL IT'S GONE

THEY CALL ME A PONTIAC
THE RED IN MY NECK
THEY CALL ME A CADILLAC
THEY CALL ME A WRECK
NOW I'M NOT AFRAID
AND I'M NOT SCARED
NOW I AIN'T GONNA LOSE IT
NO, I'M NOT AFEAR

AND DO THE FEARLESS BOOGIE
TO DO THE FEARLESS BOOGIE
SMOKIN' FEARLESS BOOGIE
UNTIL IT'S GONE

THEY CALL ME A LOVER
THEY CALL ME A FOOL
THEY CALL ME A WINNER
THEY CALL ME A MULE

DO THE FEARLESS BOOGIE
DO THE FEARLESS BOOGIE
SMOKIN' FEARLESS BOOGIE
UNTIL IT'S GONE, GONE, GONE (till the fear is gone)
