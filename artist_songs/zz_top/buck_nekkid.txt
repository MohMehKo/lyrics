Two shots shy of a 40 ounce quart
A hand in the pocket and a hand in her shorts
Shoot me the two and don't be slow
You've only got one good way to go
Get naked, buck naked,
Buck naked, it's the only way to go

Twenty-six chicks all tied in a knot
Ain't all good but it's what we got
So get naked, buck naked
Let me see you naked, it's the only way to go

Buck, buck
Feelin' so fine things are lookin' better
My baby said maybe, I said I'd let her
get naked, buck naked
Let's get naked, it's the only way to go
Get naked,
Everybody get naked,
Buck naked, it's the onliest way to go
Get naked, get naked,
Get buck naked
