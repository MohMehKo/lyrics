Where we are? 
In California

Baby let me be 
Your lovin' teddy bear 
Put a chain around my neck 
And lead me anywhere

Oh let me be 
Your teddy bear

Baby let me be 
Around you every night 
Run your fingers through my hair 
And cuddle me real tight

Let me be 
Your teddy bear

I don't want to be a tiger 
'Cause tigers play to rough 
I don't want to be a lion 
'Cause lions ain't the kind 
You love enough

I don't want to be a tiger 
'Cause tigers play to rough 
I don't want to be a rhino 
'Cause rhino's horn to gruff 
I don't want to be a cheetah 
'Cause cheetah's scratch your stuff 
I don't want be a lion 
'Cause lion's ain't the kind 
You love enough

Oh now baby, let me be 
Around your cage tonight

Wrap your lock around my key 
And turn it 'round just right

Oh let me be 
Your teddy bear

Oh let me be 
Hay hi ho teddy bear 
Oh teddy bear
