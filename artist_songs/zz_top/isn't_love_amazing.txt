Don't you wonder why sometime
How does somethin' be so fine
She got somethin' best of all
That put my ya-ya against the wall

Isn't love amazing, hey
Isn't love amazing

Ferociousness is all she crave
Precociousness don't get me laid
It don't confront me none at all
That's why we gonna have a ball

Isn't love amazing, hey
Isn't love amazing

Angels peekin' down below 'em
I got somethin' I can show 'em
And when they get up off they cloud
They'll find out what be don't allowed

Isn't that amazing
Isn't that amazing
Isn't love amazing, hey
Isn't love amazing

Big-ass love
