I GOT A FAVORITE PLACE
IN A FAVORITE TOWN
IN A FAVORITE FOREIGN COUNTRY
I BEEN HANGIN' AROUND

IT AINT TOO BIG
AND IT AIN'T TOO FAR
AND THEN WE COULD GO
CRAZY WITH OUR HEAD IN A JAR

AND GO TRIPPIN'
TRIPPIN', AWAY

YOU GOT A SECRET SLOT (slide)
IN A SECRET SPOT
WE COULD SECRETLY FREAK OUT
IF YOU GIMME A SHOT

AND SECRETLY MEET TOMORROW (secret me)
IF I TELL YOU WHAT TIME
TELL ME WHAT YOUR NAME IS
AND WHAT'S CHO' SIGN
LET'S GO TRIPPIN'
TRIPPIN' AWAY

YOU CAN TAKE YOUR HALF
OR YOU CAN TAKE MINE
ITS TOTALLY SHINE OR TOTALLY BLIND
BUT ONE OR THE OTHER'S GONNA' WORK OUT FINE

WE GO TRIPPIN'
TRIPPIN' AWAY
WE GO TRIPPIN'
WE GO TRIPPIN'
