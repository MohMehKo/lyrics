Piece
I want a little piece
I want a little piece of your love
I've been here and I've been there
Seems like I've been everywhere
Lookin around, lookin for a release
I'm just lookin around
For a piece
I want a little piece
I want a little piece of your love
So tell me, tell me, whatcha gonna do
I just wanna make love to you
For a piece,
I want a little piece
I want a little piece of your love
aha a little piece
Piece
I want a little piece
I want a little piece of your love
Bring it here, tell me tell me now
Piece
I want a little piece
I want a little piece of your love
Bring it here now
If I wouldn't lie I wouldn't be talkin
I need a warnin now
You hear me talkin
