Crawlin cross the floor at the Holiday Inn motel
I saw that girl that my swamp bone knew so well
She crawled out of Texas and flipped off to Baton Rouge
She got that Gulf coast sun tan that give the(a) poor boy the blues
Alley gator, with those hypnotic big green eyes
Alley gator, she make you crave her, she'll chew it up it ain't no lie

Crawlin through the weeds with a Louisiana mean toothed grin
You can tell her that you love her then you better tell her once again
She might scratch your back and rub you with her rack
You better watch out, stand back
Alley gator, with the hypnotic big green eyes
Alley gator, she make you crave her,
She'll chew you up it ain't no lie listen here

Alley gator, with the hypnotic big green eyes
Alley gator, she'll make you crave her
She'll chew you up it ain't no lie, listen here
Alley gator with those hypnotic big green eyes
Alley gator, alley gator, alley gator, alley gator, alley gator, alley gator
Alley gator, alley gator, crocodile, alley gator
