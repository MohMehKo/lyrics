Stop!

I coulda been a brain surgeon
I coulda been a pharmacist
I gave a shot at radio revivalist
And with the boss man I never been missed

Me so stupid
Me so stupid
Me so stupid
What is my IQ
What is my intelligent quotient?

I coulda been the Golden Gate Bridge
Or Einstein's nemesis
I coulda been the derby jockey
But it's all come down to this

Me so stupid
Me so stupid
Me so stupid
What is my IQ
What is my intelligent quotient?

I coulda been Las Vegas
I coulda built a drop top Rolls Royce
Coulda been the president of the world
Coulda had Ali on the ropes
Coulda had Miss August - again
Coulda had Miss May - again
Coulda had Miss September - again
But I waited till December 
Man oh man

Me so stupid
Me so stupid
Me so stupid
What is my IQ?
What is my intelligent quotient?

That's so wrong
