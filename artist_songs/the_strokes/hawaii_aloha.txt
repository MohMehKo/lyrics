Whether you're in L.A., 
Sunny laid back L.A. 
Whether you're in New York, 
Comfort 'round your block. 
Whether you're in the U.K., 
Where the sky is dark 
And the grass is kinda green, 
You know like Central Park. 

Still my favorite place in this whole wide world 
Has got to be in the middle of the ocean floor. 
I see you poking out of the ocean, Paradise on Earth. 

The 50th state - WHAT?! 
Hawaii. 

Ooooooh Oooh 
Ooooh Oooh Oooh 
I wanna live in somewhere different.Oh oh oh 
A nuclear distaster might be on our way. 
But I don't care, I'm in the U.S.A. 

Whether you're drunk or stoned 
or we're sober and old, 
if I'm with you I'm a happy man. 
If you feel safe and cold 
while you count your gold. 
If your problem is you can't find 
your remote control. 

Still my favorite person in this whole wide world 
is the woman who can understand every word 
and when she speaks to me, she makes me 
see the whole world 
As my favorite place... 
Hawaii. 

We got it made 
Oh Oh Oh Oh 
Yes, I know 
Can we go 
By plane or boat 
Oh Oh Oh Oh 

Whether you take it slow or you let me go 
Whether you tell me something that i did not know 
Whether you're neat and polite or you scream and fight 
Whether you tell me something that i would not like 

Still my favourite attitude in this world so far 
Is the friendly spirit of an iron heart 
I like the way folks are in this most special place 
I don't care what happens I'm taking a plane

Ooooooh Oooh 
Ooooh Oooh Oooh 
All I want to do is something different 
Oh let me in 
Oh, Cut off from Malaysia 
Back in who knows when 
Oh we got kinda lost 
But my god What a place! 
I profess 
Cannot take 
Away my soul
