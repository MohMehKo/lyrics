Happiness is two different things
What you take and then what you bring
One is pleasure, one is the flame
One's devotion, one's just deranged

Inside everyone
Love conquers alter-joy 

Don't waste your heart
Don't waste your heart
One has nothing to do with the other
...

One to take it from with my love
One's an instinct, one takes some will
One you laugh and one makes you kill
What's lovely is that one's for the end

Inside everyone
Love conquers alter-joy

Don't waste your heart
Don't waste your heart
One has nothing to do with the other
...

Don't you give in
...
