Try and try
To give me up
All the songs
Bring back
Hide them all
Deep inside
We all comeback
To pull right back down
You down, you down
You down, you down

Look in my
Lonely eyes
Seen it all
And back in my
Push inside from your mind
We all come back
To pull you right back down
To pull you down

If I show up
To push you down
To push you down
She made up
To push you down
To push you down
You down
