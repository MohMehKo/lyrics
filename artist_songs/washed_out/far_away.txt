You said hello
You passed me by
You said your heart was lost

You left your world exposed, long gone
You left your voice inside

[Chorus:]
And you're far away
She's got it
And you're far away
She's far
And now all the thoughts
Forgotten
And now all the hope
Is gone

You said no words as you walked past
You said it was alright
You left your world exposed, long gone
You left your voice inside

[Chorus]
