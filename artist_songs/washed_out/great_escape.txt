All I want is someone I can lean on
All I need is the simple life
Make believe the world has vanished around us
We could sneak away and not come back

We'll run far away
And make a great escape

We can hide out
Won't look back
Slow it down for a while
We'll be alright
You and I
Far away from it all

All I want is a place I can belong
All I need is some peace of mind
We could sneak away and start all over
We could leave today and not come back

We'll run far away
And make a great escape
