Don't try to find
Words now, you fall
Then go, reach out
The choice is yours to find

This life you've got
The light to guide
Your faith decides
The roads you're going to find

Realize
So tired
Got hope, desire
Even though it's hard to forget
What you can't afford now
Chasing all your thoughts, you know that
You'll be all right in time

This life you've got
The light to guide
Your faith decides
The roads you're going to find

This life you've got
The light to guide
Your faith decides
The roads you're going to find
