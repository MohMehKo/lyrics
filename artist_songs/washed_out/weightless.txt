Close your eyes.
You're weightless now.
Floating safe and you'll be gone.
Define of though, keep rising up.
He'll raise you to the stars.

You've waited all of your life.
To leave it all behind.

Rise up.
Forget about yourself forever.
Float up.
Forget about the pain.
Leave it all and start again.

Hold your gun.
You've made it out.
You're safe from all the low.
And over trust he needs it back.
I'm far alone and done.

You've waited all of your life.
To leave it all behind.

Rise up.
Forget about yourself forever.
Float up.
Forget about the pain.
Leave it all and start again.
