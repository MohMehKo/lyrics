Don't want to file a cuff
To carry all the time 
Don't want no story line
The times we used to have 

You're all I think about
You're always on my mind
Don't want to live without 
You know it can't be right 

Don't wanna hear your voice
Don't call me off my phone
Don't want to hit you up
To say you're moving on

You're all I think I about
You're always on my mind 
Don't want to live without
You know it can't be right

Okay, here we go
1 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4
