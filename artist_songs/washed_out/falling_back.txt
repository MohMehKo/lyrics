You call my name out
At the darkest hour
You try to deny it
To forget why
You know inside it's right

You're falling back
You're falling back
Falling back
You're falling back

You can't fight it
You don't know why
You run in circles
From what's inside
It's all you've got

You're falling back
You're falling back
Falling back
You're falling back
