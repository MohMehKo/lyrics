Hey man oh leave me alone, you know
Hey man oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man I gotta straighten my face
This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place

Hey man schooldays insane
Hey man my work's down the drain
Hey man well she's total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she... and then she...

Don't lean on me man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back on Suffragette City
Don't lean on me man,
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight... she's all right

Hey man, ah Henry, don't be unkind, go way
Hey man, ah! I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man, ah droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes

Don't lean on me man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back on Suffragette City
Don't lean on me man,
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight... she's all right

Ah, hey man!

Don't lean on me man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back on Suffragette City
Don't lean on me man,
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight... she's all right

Aaaaaah Wham Bam Thank you Ma'am!

Suffragette City... Suffragette
