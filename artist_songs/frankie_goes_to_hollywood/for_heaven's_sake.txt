Leave them behind, those clouds of trouble
We have to find a world that's new
Buy a new dress and go out dancing
Do all the things you wanna do
For heaven's sake, you have to break away
Unchain yourself, from the mood of today

We don't need aggression
We don't need recession

Just give us some money
Our life could be sunny too

We don't need regression
Nor means of repression
Our life could be sunny too ,ooh

Our lives should be so full of laughter
With endless joy to follow after
Summer comes to girls and boys
Never too late, but to enjoy, to enjoy

Oh come on down from your ivory tower
Unlock the doors and give us flowers
We've wored for you now for too long
We've done what's right, you've done us wrong
For heaven's sake, we got to break away
Unchain yourself, from the mood of today

We don't need regression
Make your impression

Oooh, world is waiting
We need to go out dancing
Oooh, world is waiting
We need a new t.v.
Oooh, world is waiting
We don't need fear and fighting
Oooh, world is waiting
We don't need history

She should buy us all a drink
She should buy us all a drink
She should stop the pain, stop the pain
She should buy us all a drink

Yeah

We don't need recession
Nor means of repression

Just give us some money
Our life could be sunny too

Just give us some money
Our life could be sunny too, ooh

She should stop and think, stop and think, oooh

We don't need regression
Nor means of repression

Just give us some money
Our lives could be sunny too, ooh
