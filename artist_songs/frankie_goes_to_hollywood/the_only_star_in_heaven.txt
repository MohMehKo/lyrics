Enjoy it or get out the game
It's such a shame to lose a game
So use your brain and play it sane
It's just a game I another plane

And when I call you on the phone
Then show me that you're really home
Let's share this thing and I will sing
Live life like a diamond ring

I can tell you something, shoop shark
That you oughta know, know
Feel my feeling
Go to let it show show show

Got to shake you tail
To break away

Fish

Got to shake you tail
To make a wave

Shark

Got to shake you tail
To break away

Get hot

Red hot

Everybody create
Create your bait
Everybody create
Before it's too late

Live life like a diamond ring
Live life like a diamond ring

Everybody create
Create your bait
Everybody create
Before it's too late

Got to shake you tail
To break away

[Chorus:]
You're the only star in heaven
You're the only star that shines
You're the only star in heaven
Now that only star is mine
Mine - yeah

On my way to hollywood
The minute I get there
And this is how you get there
Yeah yeah
Love, love

You gotta fan a flame
(flame flame fire)
You gotta fan a flame
(flame flame fire)
You gotta fan a flame
Called love, love

Space is a place (let me out)
Space is a place (let me out)
Space is a place called love, love

Give me a sign

[Chorus]

Play it

Oh oh oh

Only star in heaven
On my way to hollywood
The minute I get there
The minute I get there
For love I stake this place
Say it again
Stake this place for love

You're the only star I heaven - yeah
You're the only star that shines

Let me out

You're the only star I heaven
Now I know that star is mine

[Chorus]
