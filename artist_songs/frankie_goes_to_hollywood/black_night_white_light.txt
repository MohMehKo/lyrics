We are the leaders
And nothing can beat us
I feel so good
The angels can take you there
You better beware
Of devil may care

Tell me where you want to go
We are the leaders
Heaven's above and Hell's below
We are the leaders
Oh sing hallelujah sing hallelujah
Giving it to you
We are the leaders

Black night white light
The other side of midnight

The pleasure seekers
Are dyin' to meet you
They need young blood
The devil may take you there
You better take care
You've every ware

[Repeat]

Chasing the dragon
Get up that dragon boy-yeah
Rub your body up
Work it up so good
Got to get on up
Going up show it off-yeah

[Repeat twice]

We're on a journey
Into the light it feels so good
Your mind can take you there
With what is the call
Of body and soul

Your body and soul
