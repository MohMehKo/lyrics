We're goin' back in black history

To see some a African American archievements that came to be!

Anything is possible!
With hard work there's no obstacle!
No obstacle!

Anything is possible!
With hark work there's no obstacle!

Martin, Rosa, and thur good, too fought for equal rights to come true!

They all shared one big dream.
For us to become a united team!
Let's go!

Anything is possible!
With hard work there's no obstacle!
No obstacle!

Anything is possible!
With hard work no obstacle!

Anything is possible!
Put your mind to it!
And you can do it!

Broker barriers,justice for all
Made Jake Robinson the first black man to hit a Major League baseball!

What seemed impossible become a dream come true Magi, Julius, and Michael Jordan too!

Traffic light, the filament for lights!
Created by African Americans, that's real tight!

Bassie! The first licensed to fly
And Mae Jemison went even more high, as the first to make it in space!

And in tennis, Arthur and Althea slammed at their own pace!

Hattie and Sidney Poitier made history
As the first African Americans to win an academy!

Put your mind to it and you can do it!

Put your mind to it and you can do it!

Now there's doctors, lawyers, professors and more!
All they way up to prez number 44!
