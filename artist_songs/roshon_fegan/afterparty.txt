She’s got a phone call
A hot tip where to go y’all
I heard about another dance y’all
Ain’t no way they gonna shut us down
Listen up girls and boys
I declare it time to make some noise
Show of hands for the all real Mccoys
Will keep it going all this weekend
Hear the sound I would never let em shut us down

All the VIPS get your things follow me
DJ knows we can’t get enough
Honey don’t be shy yeah you know you looking fly
Throw your hands up high for show love


At the After party
We ain’t never gonna stop
At the After party
We can dance until we drop

Shake It Up now
Break it up now
Take it up now
At the After party
Shake It Up now
Break it up now
Take it up now


We’re gonna break some rules
This event will be the crown jewel
Hey somebody’s in the pool
Don’t see a clock
But I know there’s not a yawn
Gotta stay to win
Kick it up and let the games begin
It’s the kind of night that never ends
We just keep on having fun
We got room enough for everyone


All the VIPS get your things follow me
DJ knows we can’t get enough
Honey don’t be shy yeah you know you looking fly
Throw your hands up high for show love


At the After party
We ain’t never gonna stop
At the After party
We can dance until we drop

We got it going on tonight
Baby you look outta sight
Spinning like a satellite  
Don’t wanna come back down
No they won’t shut us down

At the After party
We ain’t never gonna stop
At the After party
We can dance until we drop

Shake It Up now
Break it up now
Take it up now
At the After party
Shake It Up now
Break it up now

We can dance until we drop
