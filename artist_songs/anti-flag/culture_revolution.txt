Get ready to - make a stand
Get ready to - make a move
Because if - we don't- fuckin' do it - then no one's going to!
No!

Have you seen the scene on the street?
Do you care what's - going on?
Thousands – homeless - in the land of the free but no one seems to think it's wrong!
That’s why we fuckin' wrote this song

Take to the streets - cause it's time to make a stand
We’re not gonna back down! Culture revolution! 
Take to the streets - cause it's time to make a stand
We're not gonna back down! Culture revolution!
This ship is sinking - it's time we set it right
Take to the streets - cause it's time to make a stand
We're not gonna back down! Culture revolution!

When the standards of - society
Are based - solely on greed
Humanity - compassion
Do not - define what it means to succeed!
No!

For the poor - contempt and hate
From the rich - middle class, the state
Compassion - dumped for
Apathy - the greatest nation ever seen?
That’s fuckin' real hard to believe

Take to the streets - cause it's time to make a stand
We’re not gonna back down! Culture revolution! 
Take to the streets - cause it's time to make a stand
We're not gonna back down! Culture revolution!
This ship is sinking - it's time we set it right
Take to the streets - cause it's time to make a stand
We're not gonna back down! Culture revolution!

Socialized – socialized
Mechanized – mechanized
To consume... everything in the world!
Saturate – saturate
Accumulate – accumulate
Your happiness... can be bought and be sold!
Environment – environment
Detriment – detriment
Is not... an issue of concern!
Humanity – humanity
Or this insanity – insanity
The choice is yours and your choice alone!
But you won't be alone no, you won't be alone... YEAH!

Take to the streets - cause it's time to make a stand
We’re not gonna back down! Culture revolution! 
Take to the streets - cause it's time to make a stand
We're not gonna back down! Culture revolution!
This ship is sinking - it's time we set it right
Take to the streets - cause it's time to make a stand
We're not gonna back down! Culture revolution!

Revolution!
In your head!
On the streets!
Move!
