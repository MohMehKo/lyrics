One day while sitting in my room
You came in preaching
Your words predicting doom
You've never once been
Happy with me,
Because I'm not
What you want me to be..No!!!
You tried to teach me
To pray and go to school
You tried to teach me
To be the system's tool
But you missed
What I was smart enough to see
That their system doesn't work
For you or me

Oh..Don't believe what they say is true
Oh..Their system doesn't work for you
Oh..You can be what you want to be
Oh..Don't have to choose

To join the corporate army
For god and country give up your life,
Don't try to figure out what's wrong or right
You never tried to stop, to look, to see
That you're exactly what you're told to be
You did everything fucking right
You followed the system's guiding light
And now you fucking bitch to me
To fucking get a job,
When you don't like
That life you've got
You fucking corporate whore
For you or me

Oh..Don't believe what they say is true
Oh..Their system doesn't work for you
Oh..You can be what you want to be
Oh..Don't have to choose

To join their corporate army
Don't have to choose
To join their corporate army
Dont have to choose, don't have to choose
To join their corporate army
