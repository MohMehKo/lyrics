see you there, youve got a cold blank stare
and you wish i was, but im not
and you? well now you just dont get it 
its the hate in your eyes. its the hate in you heart
i stand there and laugh as they cut you apart
kill people for fun, kill people for sport

[Chorus x4]
i dont want to be like you
i dont want to control you

all day big brother schemes. and into the night
they push you down, push you around
grab on hold of your mind. over run it
and crush it(break you down)
but you dont know
because nobody know
because nobody cares
because nobody tries
they cut into your heart, they cut into your mind

[Chorus Repeat]
