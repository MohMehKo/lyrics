All you punkers with your
No Future dreams
Follow Johnny Rotten 
and all our preset beliefs
Following society 
be what they want you to be
Drunk and Quiet
"there's no future for me."
IMPATIENCE with society
BE WHAT they want you to be
IMPATIENCE "there's no future here"
"I'm not lazy I just don't care"
Of course there is no future 
when you make sure there is none
Impatience "time is wasting,
there is No Future to be won"
If you truly don't care,
then why talk No Future
Excuses hang like nooses
"I've given up I just don't care"
IMPATIENCE with society
BE WHAT they want you to be
IMPATIENCE "there's no future here"
"I'm not lazy I just don't care"
Of course you'll bring no change
when you sit home on your couch
We need to stand up and fight
bring our future to a start
We can change anything just as
long as we take the time
Generations, generations, generations...
they're not the same
IMPATIENCE with society
BE WHAT they want you to be
IMPATIENCE "there's no future here"
"I'm not lazy I just don't care"
