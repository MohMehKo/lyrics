He thinks because he's got spikes on his
Leather, that he's the punkest, he thinks
he's better!  He walks around with his
Nose in the air, the only thing bigger
Than his ego is his hair
He thinks that uniform he's wearing is a
Good excuse for his snobby glaring

I don't know when punk became a uniform
I always thought that uniforms were
For the army
But I guess he's right he's got punk rock
Hair, he paid a fortune for his gear

He thinks that uniform he's wearing,
Makes him a punk, yeah

We've got to try to stick together! Oi!
Oi! We're not supposed to fight each
other Oi!  Oi! Stand against the government
but stand up for ourselves Oi! Oi!

Lost on book shelves Oi! Oi!

now we're competing, now we're fighting
He drives the younger kids away
Sacrificing us for his image, punk rock
Kids will pay
