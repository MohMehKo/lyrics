she was showered in jewels
but her dad beat on her every day and night
and there was nothing she could do

she found it now
she found the meaning of life

so you can die [x3]
yeah

you find it now
you find the meaning of life
your only born so you can die
you find it now
you find the meaning of life
your only born so you can die

so you can die [x3]
