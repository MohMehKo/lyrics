They feed us brainrot, and tell us that it's true 
Dan Rather is reporting something but it isn't news 
It's molded, and folded, and beamed into your home 
The next minute you find yourself dying for fucking oil... 

Immediate - Reaction, to the brainrot in your mind 
Immediate - Subtraction, to the time left in your life 
Immediate - Reaction, to the brainrot in your mind 
Immediate - Substraction, but all we really want, 
all we really want, is truth 

Bred into silence by television sets 
Accepting lies from media so soon we will forget 
The lives that we spend as workers for the rich 
You work so much there's no time left to realize 
that you're in a fucking ditch
