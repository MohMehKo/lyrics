A black man driving down the street one day 
Pulled over by racist boys in blue in Brentwood,Pa.
Theres no reason,they dont have any right 
It's just that in their eyes he's not the correct shade of white....
Driving in a neighborhood that's reigned by whites
Ain't healthy for a black man trying to live a lengthy life
All those cops they walked off free,but him he's in a grave
His name is Jhonny Gammage,one of thousands they have slain

We've got no rights.....
....When cops can kill
it's not right....
.....we live in fear

Patrol man crusing in his car at night
Just looking for some homeys he can rough up in a fight
Pulled over 3 kids in a total rage
Next thing that you know there's bodies all over the place
His back up came & they're all acting tough
3 kids vs. 6 or 7 cops all armed with billy clubs
The cops they did it just cause those kids color and their age
They say that's not the truth,but this happens every fucking day!!!

We've got no rights....
....When cops can kill
it's not right.....
.....we live in fear 

Fear of what you're gonna do,when a cops talking shit to you
Fear of what you're gonna say,when the cops come gunning your way 
Fear of what you should'nt do,when the cops try to provoke you
Fear that on any given day,the cops could take your life away......

They say they're here,to keep the peace........
WHAT A BUNCH OF FUCKIN SHIT!!!

We've got no rights...
....when cops can kill
it's not right.....
....we live in fear

TAKE BACK YOUR RIGHTS!!!
