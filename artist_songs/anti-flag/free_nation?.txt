State official talks of freedom
THEY-TALK!
In this country that we live in
THEY-TALK!
Free to be harassed and be beaten by the pigs
YOUR RIGHTS? NO RIGHTS!
Till you're fucking broken, crippled, or until you're fucking DEAD!

YEAH!

They pass laws unfair to gays
THEIR-WORK
And separatist laws to keep the non-whites in their place
THEIR-WORK
Family values as a smoke screen blowing in your face
THEIR TRUTH? NO TRUTH!
Family values isn't something that shouldn't be based on hate

Based on hate...

Justice presides over them, late into the night,
A blind fold covering their eyes, but something isn't right...
Under their arms, there are shackles on her legs
And the hands that once held up her scales are bound,
Are bound in chains!
Bound in chains... 

And behind their closed door, they conspire through the night
MORE WORK? SICK WORK!
And they won't stop until this nation is all straigh and all white!

NO!!

They call it a free nation... but all it is, is A NAZI NATION!!!
