Why don't you come over here and see what you've created
It'll make you laugh so hard you'll cry
And lookin' into the black you make me so far past sick
Lookin' into your eyes I wish you'd die
No more dead
No more dead
Two, three, four
Well I've seen the crosses burnt and holy
And the people they all come down they're screaming
"Hey man, it's a fix!"
And I looked into the cause in which, you were striving towards
And I thought, though of the wasted, the wasted youth..
No more dead
No more dead
No more dead dead dead 
No more dead
No more dead
No more dead
No more dead dead dead
No more dead
He's lying all alone
His life is stolen, yes it's gone
Into the black of the night can't you see it was no fault of his own
Trapped in a slum, bred into a slum,
Killing his own instead of rich white men
And he's never gonna escape from it now,
Because it's over, and he's dead
The end
