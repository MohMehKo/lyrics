All united, all as one, let's make a stand...
We've got a privilege in the power that we command !
So let's not drown in ignorance, 
And let our strenght waste away...
As the richest nation in the world, we've got a responsibility !

Vieques, Puerto Rico, a pretectorate -- of the USA.
Part a home for native families, the rest...
A NAVY BOMBING RANGE !!

Shells misfired kill civilians there, 
And napalm hangs in the island air.
But the government beats down protests against this misuse...

So...

STAND UP, FIGHT BACK, RESIST-REFUSE !!
'Cause if we don't do it, no one's going to...
So,
STAND UP, FIGHT BACK, RESIST-REFUSE !!
'Cause if we don't do it, no one's going to...

I look into the eyes, of a dead island boy's face.
His (eyes) remind me of another's,
From a different time and place...

Where A-Bombs baked the ground,
Of Bikini's tropical lands.
Where a culture was erased,
Families misplaced,
BY A NAZI-ESQUE LIKE PLAN !!!

All done, in your name, by Uncle Sam...
So if we don't fight it, then we're guilty to !

So...

STAND UP, FIGHT BACK, RESIST-REFUSE !!
'Cause if we don't do it, no one's going to...

I think it's 'bout time that we had a change...
I think it's 'bout time that WE MAKE A CHANGE !!
