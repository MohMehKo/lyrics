watch your right watch your left watch the right watch the center and watch your back!

it's on the radio, it's on the TV news 
conservatives and liberals
with ever clashing views but as the days go by
i can't tell which side is talking their left is in the center
and labeled "liberal doctrine"

they do nothing for you...
they do nothing for me... no!
they give us nothing to believe
watch your right watch your left watch the right watch the center and watch your back! [x2]

let the feds pass a law, that takes your rights away cause
"you gotta sacrifice if you want to stay safe!"
til the day you find the feds in your back pocket
locking you away for saying, "question", "think", or "stop it"

they do nothing for you...
they do nothing for me... no!
they give us nothing to believe
watch your right watch your left watch the right watch the center and watch your back! [x2]

joseph mccarthy and reagan
set the motherfuckin' stage for the right leanings that now grip the u.s.a.
they framed and jailed the reds
lost the keys to the cell set up
the capitalist machine to go in for the kill... yeah... yeah... yeah... 

social divisions encouraged by the few - few!
those few in power - suckerin' suckers like you - you!
as corporate welfare, flows from troughs of the state - state!
yeah big business, takes more than their fair take - take!
but in the end it is suckers like you - you!
who buy that the poor, are givin' you the screw - screw!
can't you realize that it's just talk, talk, talk, talkin'...
like tax men at your door, fuckin' knockin' knockin' knockin'...
watch your right watch your left watch the right watch the center and watch your back! [x4]
