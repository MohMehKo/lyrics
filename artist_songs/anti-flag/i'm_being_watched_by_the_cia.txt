Oh say can you see
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hail
At the twilight's last gleaming
I'M BEING WATCHED I'M BEING WATCHED
I'M BEING WATCHED BY THE C.I.A.
I'M BEING WATCHED I'M BEING WATCHED
I'M BEING WATCHED BY THE C.I.A.
They said there's drug dealers selling on my streets
Those fuckers capped me three times in the feet
I've got two slugs embedded in my chest
Two hollow points from the nations best
I'M BEING WATCHED I'M BEING WATCHED
I'M BEING WATCHED BY THE C.I.A.
I'M BEING WATCHED I'M BEING WATCHED
I'M BEING WATCHED BY THE C.I.A.
They call me on the phone when I'm home alone
They ask for the Marines but they're just a bunch of whores
They spend their money on hotels just so they can tell
Tell Mr. President that I'm jerking off
I'M BEING WATCHED I'M BEING WATCHED
I'M BEING WATCHED BY THE C.I.A.
I'M BEING WATCHED I'M BEING WATCHED
I'M BEING WATCHED BY THE C.I.A. C.I.A.
