Spend a lifetime working for these people
To make what they earn in one day
There are options to choose, I call it Social Progress
Progress to not be abused

They were arrested for their views
It was the protesters they screwed
And still had the nerve to ask
Who I was voting for
Cause when you silence our youth
Then you silence the truth 
Our right not to remain...

YEAH!!!

Start funding lives that move for changes 
Not funding leaders that oppress and use
When politicians become nothing more but major corporations
Posing as humans, real humans lose...

SILENT!!!

I won't remain 
I won't remain silent
I won't remain 
I won't remain SILENT!!!!

Bring out your dead...
Oppression 
Intimidation 
Suppression
