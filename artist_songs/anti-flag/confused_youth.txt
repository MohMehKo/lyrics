She’s always askin' him what he wants to do
How many times does he have to say, he's fucking confused?
He’d run away but there’s nowhere else to run
Why do they try to conform us? we just wanna have fun

We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight for our youth
Wo...oh...oh confused youth
Wo...oh...oh confused youth
Wo...oh...oh confused youth

"Why don't you go to school? You need to grow up."
They’re so infatuated like growing up is something you shoot up
Some girls my age they want to have a baby
Well I actually don’t wanna get married... they're fucking crazy

We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight for our youth
Wo...oh...oh confused youth
Wo...oh...oh confused youth
Wo...oh...oh confused youth

Adults like to bring us up to be and act like them
If we don't act alike, discard and try again
There is no room deep in their eyes for an individual
“Conform” and “stand in line” make sure you fit the mould
It’s alright to grow old, to mature and become wise
Too bad all they seem to want is to die in ignorance
Straighten your back, straighten your face and lose your grin
It’s time to be serious, think hard but always give in
You are the inferior, open your eyes and close your mouth
Just grow up to be just like me, watch and follow with no doubt
Train children like a dog, try not to get in the way
When I talk you should obey, try not to get in the way
It’s not a war, what are you fighting for?
Life’s not a war, there's no need to conform
We need help but not everyday
No need, no need to use force
We need help but not in every single way
We don't need utter control

"Why don't you go to school? you need to grow up"
Like growing up is something that you just shoot up
All of us, we'd run away, but where would we go?
Just loosen your grip on our leash you don't have to let go

We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight for our youth
Wo...oh...oh confused youth
Wo...oh...oh confused youth
Wo...oh...oh confused youth
