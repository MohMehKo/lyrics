Sittin' home on a Saturday night
I can't believe she called me
I've beening waitin' for my whole life
and now she's dead

Betty Sue..is dead!
Betty Sue...

Sittin' home on a Saturday night
I've got nothin' better to do
then to sit here and play with myself
now that she's dead

Betty Sue...is dead!
Betty Sue...

This song is about my girlfriend from 1953.
She was the hottest girl in town. But nobody liked
her except for me.

She was bi-sexual...bi-sexual (no way) bi-sexual (heh wow)
there's no such thing as a bi-sexual in 1953!
(say that again)
there's no such thing as a bi-sexual in 1953!

She died yesterday (oh..oh) in a car wreck (oh..oh)
looking at her playboy..and now she's dead!

She died yesterday (oh..oh) in a car wreck (oh..oh)
a large price to pay to be a pervert

Betty Sue...is dead!
Betty Sue...

...to be a pervert!

Betty Sue...is dead!
Betty Sue is dead.

oh yeah she's one dead girl!
