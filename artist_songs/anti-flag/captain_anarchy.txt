A-N-A-R-C-H-Y !

He says that for the punk rock scene
He'd give his fucking life,
But he only ever paid to see a show once
maybe twice...

Instead he stands outside the halls
And pan handles for beer,
Then sneaks into the hall
To deface the bathroom mirror !

A-N-A-R-C-H-Y !
His name is "captain anarchy",
But only in his mind...
A-N-A-R-C-H-Y !
So punk that he's a poser and he'll be one
till he dies !

You never saw an anarchist
With such perfect hair,
Or so many ten dollar spikes,
Or so much punk rock gear...

He said he used his welfare checks
To buy his boots and plaids...
In reality it was all paid for
By his mommy and his dad !

A-N-A-R-C-H-Y !
His name is "captain anarchy",
But only in his mind...
A-N-A-R-C-H-Y !
He's anarchy incarnate but only in his (mind)...

You know he just can see,
OI! OI! OI! OI!
It's up to you and me...
OI! OI! OI! OI!
I don't want to be,
OI! OI! OI! OI!
Fighting, let's stride for...
Some unity!!!

...Let's go!!

A-N-A-R-C-H-Y !
His name is "captain anarchy",
But only in his mind...
A-N-A-R-C-H-Y !
So punk that he's a poser and he'll be one
till he dies !
