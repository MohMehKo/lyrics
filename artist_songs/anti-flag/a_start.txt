rats, monkeys, mice - teach 'em little tricks stay far from creativity, and from politics cause the multinationals need a solid work force or their growing profit margins will be wiped out at the source conform to the status quo, set rules hold your mind into their fucking tool reciting back their facts and numbers - that don't make you smart there's much more to intelligence - and thinking for yourself would be a start it would be a start... start!  pledge allegiance to a flag of which you're taught no history not mexico, granada, panama, or middle east but they're just a mere fraction of this country's shady past skeletons locked in the closet and i doubt they'll be the last "national interest, " defined for you... but who's it really serve?  who's getting screwed?  your prison warden is your school training you to be a social screw stage a jailbreak, swim against the flow show those motherfuckers what you know!  i feel like i am suffocating i feel my life depreciating i know their teachings are riddled with lies, distortions, shit!  it kills me knowing the masses are so brainwashed by it - brainwashed by it!
