he knows he'll be alone tonight,
while contemplating, "What can i do?" 
The lack of hope leaves him feeling violent,
it's not that he's looking for a fight, 
it's just... he don't know where to turn,
more stress than help,

mental, sexual, physical violence 
not once she heard an encouraging word,

so her life became something, 
so out of control... 

Angry, young and poor!
Angry, young and pissed!
Angry no one cares!

Angry, young and poor!
Angry, young and pissed!
Angry no one cares!

don't know where to turn 
don't know what to do...

Angry, young and poor!
Angry, young and pissed!
Angry no one cares!
