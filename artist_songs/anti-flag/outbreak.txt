the president got caught getting head so soon some people will be dead iraqi bodies scattered around by the cluster bombs that land in their barracks and their homes they (i.e. u.s. representatives) get on t.v. and openly state that saddam hussein should be removed from his place if anybody said that about the u.s. president the u.s. military would rip them a new ass so where is the real terrorist? in the middle east or the u.s.? so who is the real terrorist? is it saddam hussein or the u.s. president?
