As I look from this stage at the hundreds of kids in this room with me,
The truth is so plain and so obvious, I just can't help to see... 

That all of us, we are one and the same,
Only different in our ages and our names !!!

How many times have you heard that you're a bore or you're no good ? 
I know that all of us have been there, that's why we're all here joined as one !

We don't need that shit, this ain't no punk rock clique !
We're as one at the show, and one after the show.
We don't need that shit, this ain't no punk rock clique ! 
Acceptance at the show, and then after the show...

Society says that we're crazy, with utopian unreal goals...
But we're figthing for something we truly believe,
And all I can say his I'm glad we do,
We do...
And they can say what they want,
Because our hearts are TRUE !!!

What we've had through these years has been so unforgettable...
and what we've had through these years has been so unbelievable !
[2x]

We don't need that shit, this ain't no punk rock clique !
We're as one at the show, and one after the show.
We don't need that shit, this ain't no punk rock clique ! 
We're equal at the show, and then after the show...

It's what we want to do !!
