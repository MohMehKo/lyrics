You push and push a people, what are they to do?
Soon this corporate run government will be through
See, it doesn't represent the people anymore
Big business are the pimps and governments' their whores
We don't need more time to talk over a solution
We know what we need, we need a fucking revolution

We don't need your war machine, or your filthy blood stained dollars
We’ve got one thing you ain’t got
We’ve got, we've got, we've got... got the numbers!

To you the masses are not even human beings
We’re dogs that will be grateful for any scraps you leave
But even dogs will only put up with so much abuse
Keep stealing from us like you are we're gonna let loose
We don't need more time to talk over a solution
We know what we need, we need a fucking revolution

We don't need your war machine, or your filthy blood stained dollars
We’ve got one thing you don't have
We’ve got, we've got, we've got... got the numbers!
We’ve got...we have... we've got the numbers!

We don't need more time to talk over a solution
We know what we need, we need a fucking revolution!!!

We don't need your war machine, or your filthy blood stained dollars
We’ve got one thing you ain’t got
We’ve got, we've got, we've got... got the numbers!
