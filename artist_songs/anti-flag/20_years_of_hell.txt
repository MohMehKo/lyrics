Alright!
I've stood by, and I've cried
While friends have died
You ever have a friend kill themselves or, 
Shot down, or knifed?
Just when I think I've seen it
For the final time,
It comes knocking back again 
To devastate my life

20 years of hell (20 years)
20 years of hell (20 years)
For I've been living for too long
And I wish my life was done
20 years of hell (20 years)
20 years of hell (20 years)
For I've been living for too long
And I wish my life was done
20 years of hell

I said, 'Good-Bye' to you, 
On a summer's night
Now I wish that I had stayed with you, but 
Oh it's too late
Next thing I knew was that
You'd been in an attack
And you were laying in a cold morgue 
Stuffed into a body bag

20 years of hell (20 years)
20 years of hell (20 years)
For I've been living for too long
And I wish my life was done
20 years of hell (20 years)
20 years of hell (20 years)
For I've been living for too long
And I wish my life was done

Saw you last night you said was wrong
Where'd I get the idea you were gone?
Woke up to sounds of my own screams
Woke up in a sweat it was just a dream
That dream goes on and on and on?
Will it ever end? Well I don't? 
I don't know
I don't? know?
