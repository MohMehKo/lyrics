I was talking to this girl before a show 
Does she like me? i don't know 
I asked her to go out on saturday night 
She said "ok that would be alright" 

Then she left she had to go to work 
She gave me her number and said, "i feel like a jerk." 
I asked her if she'd dance for a song 
She said she'd be dancing all night long 

She's my little go-go dancer [x3] 
She's my little fast kids go-go-go 

She didn't tell me she danced in a cage 
Hanging high above the stage 
I worked my way with a push and a shove 
Before i knew i knew it i was in love 

I waited every second until saturday night 
I took her to dinner things were going alright 
Then we went out dancing went to have some fun 
We danced and we danced - danced all night long 

She's my little go-go dancer [x3] 
She's my little fast kids go-go-go
