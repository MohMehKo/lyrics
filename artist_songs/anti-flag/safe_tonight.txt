You know I feel so violent, 
Just want to break some glass,
Every day I pray it'll be my last
Turning to a blank wall wondering what to do? 
Turning to a caliber .22
Every day he starts the same old fight.  
And every day it just gets worse by night.
If I hit the streets I think I'll be alright.
But until I do, I won't be safe tonight.
Safe tonight
Every day I remember all that lead to this.
And every day don't ya know I get a little more pissed.
Banging on myself because I just don't care.
There's nothing left for me back there
He's twisted and violent, 
I don't know what to do.
I left there for the streets last night
Thinking only of you, be safe tonight
Safe tonight
It all falls down on to me, like a baseball bat.
It hurts me, haunts me, hurts me, haunts me
I never want to go back. 
I'm twisted tonight, and I don't know what to do?
I'm twisted tonight, I want to be with you, I want to be with you,
I want to be with you, be with, be with, be with you..
Safe tonight
