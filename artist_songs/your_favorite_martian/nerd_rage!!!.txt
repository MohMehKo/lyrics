They say I Nerd Rage
I say they don’t understand
Keep talkin’ trash bitch
Imma have to ban you from my chat room
And I can hardly think
But Imma have to slap Jar Jar Binks
And slam George Lucas’ head in a car door
For far more than just ruining Star Wars
Stop re-mastering, you’re making it worst
And for the love of god, Greedo didn’t shoot first!
And fuck Comic Sans
And fuck low bandwidth
And never say Pluto ain’t a planet, goddamnit
I’m readin’ what you’re saying on the message boards
Yes, I have too had sex before!
With a girl, you don’t know her, she moved away! Shut up!
And don’t tell me Dr. Who is the same
Without Tom Baker, the shit is just lame
And what do you mean you’ve never seen Citizen Kane?

I broke seven keyboards over my knee
How dare you say Marvel is better than DC
Your horrible grammar, it’s makin’ me puke
And Captain Kirk was far superior to John Luke Picard
And a Jedi could whip Superman in a fight
When I’m right Imma laugh like

(Nerd Laugh)

You beat me in chess; I’m flippin’ the board
Then I’ll go to Michael Bay’s house, kick in the door
Break every single copy of Transformer 4
Hit Bay in the dick with a stick ’til he’s sore
I’ll own your ass in Halo so bad you might cry
And who the hell jacked my twelve-sided die
I’m gonna beat you up; I know karate, ask my girlfriend
Yes, I have a girlfriend
Did I mention I have a girlfriend?

I see Wil Wheaton, and I get excited
Pick up your toys!
They’re collector’s items!
Shut up Mom!
And give ’em back to me!
And Holy Shit!
Don’t take them out the packaging!
And clean your room; it smells like manure
And stop watching porn videos on your computer
I’m doing research. Leave me alone; why you hatin’?
I just think it’s weird that all the girls are Asian

What? You never heard of Joss Whedon?
He’s like one of the greatest writer/directors of our time!
And what do you mean Phantom Menace is your favorite Star Wars movie?
God da…dude, alright
We can’t be friends
I can’t be your friend anymore
Goodbye
