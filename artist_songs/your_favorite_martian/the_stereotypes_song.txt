You know, I always thought stereotypes were kinda ridiculous.
So I wrote a song about it,
And it goes a little something like this.

I think I love you more than the
Japanese love tentacle porn,
And we should dance dance dance d-d-dance to these stereotypes.
Let's come together and live in this world like a unibrow on an Indian girl,
And we should dance dance dance d-d-dance to these stereotypes.

Check it out now.
I love those fat Americans.
You know they so obnoxious.
They always eating burgers.
They always holding shotguns.
And I love Mexicans.
The way they mow my lawn.
They all got a 100 kids 'cause they don't know how to put a condom on.
Uh huh.
'Cause that's the way they roll.
Ya gotta go big like an Israeli nose.
If you ever buy a pint for an Irish guy,
And they're out of control like a Chinese driver.

I love the Middle East, but how do they handle
Rockin' burkas while they're riding camels.
I love Jamaicans. Yeah, they cool, but they're always high, so don't let them fool ya.
Ya mon.
And I love them Puerto Ricans,
Even though they wash their ass about once a week and,
I'm just joking.
If you didn't know then
You're a little slow and you're probably from Poland.

I think I love you more than the
Japanese love tentacle porn,
And we should dance dance dance d-d-dance to these stereotypes.
Let's come together and live in this world like a unibrow on an Indian girl,
And we should dance dance dance d-d-dance to these stereotypes.

Aw yeah! Let me hear you yell
If you love the Outback redneck Australians,
And the crooked ass teeth of an English dude
And those creepy Italians who think they're smooth.
Mamma mia!
And how could anyone hate the French.
Yeah, I know their hairy women don't shave their pits.
Brazilian girls is what you want,
Walking around town with that ba-dunk-a-dunk.

I love Africans, but hold up a second.
National Geographic says they're all butt-nekkid.
Breasts hanging low. What have they done with their clothes?
They've disappeared like coke up a Colombian's nose.
Uh oh! You're all on my checklist,
Even Russian guys who drink Vodka for breakfast.
They're stereotypes, and if you believe them,
Then your brain is small like a Korean penis.

I think I love you more than the
Japanese love tentacle porn,
And we should dance dance dance d-d-dance to these stereotypes.
Let's come together and live in this world like a unibrow on an Indian girl,
And we should dance dance dance d-d-dance to these stereotypes.

All together now!
I love Scotsmen, though they hump sheep.
[repeat 4x]
They hump sheep [repeat 3x]

I think I love you more than the
Japanese love tentacle porn,
And we should dance dance dance d-d-dance to these stereotypes.
Let's come together and live in this world like a unibrow on an Indian girl,
And we should dance dance dance dance dance to these stereotypes.

Yeah. I'm just playing, you know I love you guys.
But seriously, don't hump any sheep.
