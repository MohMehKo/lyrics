Oh snap! It’s a robot bar fight
Oh no! It’s a robot bar fight
Oh snap! It’s a robot bar fight
Oh no! It’s a robot bar fight

I remember I used to serve drinks at this local joint
Cause I was broke but my focal point was
This wasn’t no regular bar
It was a spot where robots were ready to spar
And one night Megatron rolled in
He ordered Pennzoil
Drank it straight from a can
His plan was to go and get wasted again
Standing next to Megaman with a drink in his hand

Oh snap! It’s a robot bar fight (Have you ever seen them?)
Oh no! It’s a robot bar fight (You ain’t never seen them)
Oh snap! It’s a robot bar fight (You ain’t never seen them)
Oh no! It’s a robot bar fight

Now Megatron was
Rambunctious, hoping to lay
That lady from the Jetsons, Rosie the Maid
He said, “Hey, baby. Can I lube your parts?
We can put our metal together, produce a spark.”
Now, she was praying for a man to defend her from the offender
Her friend Bender walked in and wopped, clocked, socked him in the jaw
Then he saw Dr. Robotnik
And Robotnik was about to attack
And Terminator grabbed a bottle sayin’ “I’ll be back.”
Cause he knew Megatron for a couple of years
Hit Bender with the bottle and it busted his gears

Oh snap! It’s a robot bar fight (Have you ever seen them?)
Oh no! It’s a robot bar fight (You ain’t never seen them)
Oh snap! It’s a robot bar fight (You ain’t never seen them)
Oh no! It’s a robot bar fight

Now Marvin the Paranoid Android was startled, right
And he screamed, “It’s a robot bar fight.”
And Robocop busted in to stop ‘em
Started shooting at Robotnik
Blaka! Blaka!
Bullet hit Robotnik in the esophagus
One grazed the shoulder of Maria from Metropolis
Before Robocop could say he was sorry
In jumped her boyfriend Wall-E
Wall-E rolled up, pretty upset
Took Robocop’s gun, pistol-whipped him in the neck
And everybody ran.
He was fixin’ to shoot at R2 and C3PO kissin’ in a booth

Oh snap! It’s a robot bar fight (Have you ever seen them?)
Oh no! It’s a robot bar fight (You ain’t never seen them)
Oh snap! It’s a robot bar fight (You ain’t never seen them)
Oh no! It’s a robot bar fight

Oh snap! It’s a robot bar fight (Have you ever seen them?)
Oh no! It’s a robot bar fight (You ain’t never seen them)
Oh snap! It’s a robot bar fight (You ain’t never seen them)
Oh no! It’s a robot bar fight

Once Wall-E got the gat, he went crazy and snapped
He had everybody trapped, and he started to cap
Every single robot left in the place
Even that goofy bastard from Lost in Space
Wall-E paused for a moment for a re-up
So I fled out the back with Maria
She wasn’t hurt except a scratch on her shoulder
So I took her back to my home and I boned her
Or maybe I just make all that up
