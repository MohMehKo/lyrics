I don’t know if you’re aware
but your kids suck ass
If you need someone to whip ‘em then,
ha… just ask ’cause
They ain’t as perfect
as you say they is.
They ain’t perfect at all.
You’re raising Bebe’s kids.
I’m sorry. I don’t know you.
I don’t mean to get pissy
but you need to discipline
your bratty kids, you hippy.
Like c’mere you little jerk.
Taste the back of my palm!
But you ain’t my daddy!
Nah! But I’m doing your mom!

Now I know you think they’re angels,
but they’re driving me insane.
I’ll punch a baby in the face
just for cryin’ on a plane.
Cause I don’t mess around.
You need to control ‘em or I’ll lose it.

But I made you a drawing.

Shut the fuck up, kid.
That’s stupid.
Now Imma get my truck.
Imma load all my boys in back.
Imma find out where you live
and break all your toys in half.
And I know it ain’t your birthday,
but when nobody’s lookin’
Imma give you a little present.

What?

An ass-whoopin’!!

Please may I whip your kids.
Whip your kids.
Please may I whip your kids.
Whip your kids.
Please may I whip your kids.
I wanna whip your kids.
Please let me whip your kids.
Please I wanna whip your kids.
I whip your kids.
Please
I whip your kids.
I wanna whip your kids.

I never ever thought I’d say a kid deserved
to get hit but it’s obvious time-out
ain’t working for shit!
Yeah, I’ve seen your parenting style.
It ain’t all that.
You gotta hit the little brat with a whiffle ball bat.
‘Cause this is obviously more than
just a youthful rebellion.
You gotta belt the little hellions
with a belt when they’re yellin’
Cause you don’t want me to do it cause
I’ll paint their little brains all over
the wall when I spank ‘em with a chainsaw.

And why are they acting wild and loose?
If they deserve the ass-whoopin’,
it ain’t child abuse.
When I’m tryin’ to buy groceries,
and they’re muckin’ up my style.
They’re like drunkin’ little midgets
runnin’ up and down the aisle.
Touching everything in sight,
and geez for Christ’s sake
I think one of ‘em just stuck
his little penis in my cake.
And now Imma have to put it back
and get a new one. And it bugs me.

But mommy says I’m beautiful.

Shut the fuck up kid you’re ugly!

Please may I whip your kids.
Whip your kids.
Please may I whip your kids.
Whip your kids.
Please may I whip your kids.
I wanna whip your kids.
Please let me whip your kids.
Please I wanna whip your kids.
Please let me whip your kids.
I whip your kids.
Please
I whip your kids.
I wanna whip your kids.
Please let me whip your children.
Please let me whip your kids.
I can’t stand kids misbehaving,
running around and disobeying.
All they need is a kick in the pants.
A punt in the butt.
A lesson that will finally shut ‘em up!

Please let me whip your children.
Please let me whip your kids.

Please may I whip your kids.
Whip your kids.
Please may I whip your kids.
Whip your kids.
I gotta whip!
I gotta whip!
Get em out of the way.
Please may I whip your kids.
I wanna whip your kids.
Please let me whip your kids.
Please I wanna whip your kids.
Please let me whip your kids.
I whip your kids.
Please
I whip your kids.
I wanna whip your kids.

Oh, come on people, it’s a joke.
We would never hit anyone’s kid, come on!
I love kids!
Come here and give me a hug you little rugrats!
Hey, what, what the, what?
