Man I feel like we live in a life of Nintendo,
Cause reality's such a hassle
Sometimes I even find my princess in another castle
I should ask Dr. Mario for medicine
Maybe hit up Little Nemo for a sedative
And slip into a Final Fantasy until the sequels get repetitive
You know I'll never let this, stack up against me Tetris
Some call me Pac-Man, maka-maka-maka
Cause I eat these spirits for breakfast
And if my game ain't startin',
Baby feel free to blow on my cartridge
Alcohol makes everything so pixelated when you party in a

8-bit world – we're side scollin' in this
8-bit world – collectin' coins in a
8-bit world – we're next level

Nowadays my life's so complicated
My TV is 3D, not pixelated
The music is 4 free and 5, 6, 7, 8 bit
Plug me in, you don't even gotta say shit
Hittin' all my neighbors in Mercedes. Okay they annoyed
Ask me why I do it, cause I'm all about the Paper Boy
Let me know that I am just the illest villain they employed
Let me slow it down, slow it down with the illest noise
Damn girl, you kinda made my screen froze
Take you to my d-pad, show you who's the hero
Give you all the recap, got a Metal Gear flow
Cause it's so solid, my whole team brolic
Came to L.A. man, now I gotta dodge her
You ain't gonna make it in these streets like Frogger
I'm on YouTube like a blogger
You heard me, groupies wanna blow, Kirby

I drink until I feel like Tyson punched me out
And until these chicks get sick of us
I'll collect hearts like Kid Icarus
Hey Princess, did I tell you
I'm gonna be the next Legend of Zelda
I'm gonna be the one making noise
A real Mega Man amongst Paper Boys

I take these ploys, lay them out, tell them see you later
Haters gettin' in my face so I'ma call them Space Invaders
Once I get her, I'ma take her
Y'all say that this is luck son
But they don't ever shoot me down (down)
