You don't know me, baby, but I've seen you around.
It might be kind of crazy, but I'm just new in town.
And now I wonder what you'd think if I said, hey look
I'd like to get your number and a link to your Facebook.
Now if I tell you what a nice guy's supposed to
Would that compel you not to scream when I approach you?
You'll have to promise me you'll take this news calmly,
But honestly, I'm sort of a zombie.

I knew you'd be surprised. You can bet that I
May not be alive, but I sure as hell ain't dead inside.
What's with the shotty? I ain't wishing you harm.
You see, I'd try to hold your hand but I'm missing an arm.
Brains are all I've eaten all week it's true,
But if my heart were still beating, it would beat for you.
So let me take you to Wendy's. You deserve it.
Yeah, I'm a zombie, baby. Ain't nobody perfect.

I'll chase you through the yard and all through the house into the dark.
I wanna steal your heart and eat your brains.
I've never been so true, but if my heart were still beating, it would beat for you.
I wanna steal your heart and eat your brains.

Baby, sometimes I bite, and you can bet
That I've got an appetite for human flesh.
I'll always be near though. You'll have to accept that
When I nibble on your earlobe you might get infected.
Cause I fell in love with you and I'm

Undead but you make me feel alive.
And when I chase you through the graveyard
It feels like foreplay.

If I'm lying I'm dying, and I speak truly
When I say I love your mind. I'll take brains over beauty.
We'll be the undead Dagwood and Blondie
When I teach you how to zombie, teach you, teach you how to zombie.
And everybody will love you, and you can sing along
To this post-apocalyptic, postmortem love song.
So give me a chance,girl. You know I'll be worth it.
Yeah, I'm a zombie, baby. Ain't nobody perfect.

I'll chase you through the yard and all through the house into the dark.
I wanna steal your heart and eat your brains.
I've never been so true, but if my heart were still beating, it would beat for you.
I wanna steal your heart and eat your brains.

Brains. Brains. Brains. Brains.
Brains. Brains.

I'll chase you through the yard and all through the house into the dark.
I wanna steal your heart and eat your brains.
I've never been so true, but if my heart were still beating, it would beat for you.
I wanna steal your heart and eat your brains.
