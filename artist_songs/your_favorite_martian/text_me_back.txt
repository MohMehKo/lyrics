I'm checking out your Facebook
I drive past where you work
You tell me you're my girlfriend
But are you even on planet earth?
I see you out with your friends but
Yo who the hell is that dude?
You're not playing with me are you girl?
Well hell, I wouldn't put it past you
I hate that you just won't text me
You say you're out with Becky
Why you dress so sexy
I check my text every five seconds obsessing
That you're in another dude's bedroom undressing.

He's got you pressed on your back
It's a wrestling match
Well anything he's good at
I'm the best at that
My heart was broken
I was hoping it would be left in tact
So please let's just chat
Just text me back!

I wasn't crazy
I wasn't crazy
I wasn't crazy
Until I met you
Crazy
I wasn't crazy
Until I met you

I refresh your Facebook
Analyze all your wall posts
Why'd you leave a smiley face on that one dude's page
Or whatever you call those
The fact that you flirt with
That dirty rat that you work with
I feel the love boat sinking
I'm trying to bring it back to the surface
Why do you keep pictures of your ex around?
You think he's better than me?
Why you letting me drown?
In my own imagination
That I face when I'm alone
I'm going to wait until you sleep
And then I'm going through your phone
'Cause I don't believe you when you tell me
He's only a friend
I'm not possessive, I'm depressed
You let me feel lonely again
So I'm sitting in my bedroom checkin' your Facebook
Checkin you're Facebook
Text me back!

I wasn't crazy
I wasn't crazy
I wasn't crazy
Until I met you
Crazy
I wasn't crazy
Until I met you
I wasn't crazy
I wasn't crazy
I wasn't crazy
Until I met you

I had a dream that I killed you
I'm not certain what it means
I didn't say that I would do it
I said it was a dream
Anger is the lone emotion flowing through my veins
Knowing you I may spend the night
Going through some pain
Call me insane call me obsessed
The fact remains that I will rage
Unless you text me back!

I wasn't crazy
I wasn't crazy
I wasn't crazy
Until I met you
I wasn't crazy
Until I met you

I wasn't crazy
Until I met you

I wasn't crazy
Until I met you

I wasn't crazy
I wasn't crazy
I wasn't crazy
Until I met you
