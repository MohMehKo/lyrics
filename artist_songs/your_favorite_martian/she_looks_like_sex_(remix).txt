She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
Sex

Sex, sex
She looks like sex
Sex, sex
Oo-ooh

She looks like sex
Maybe not yet, but don't fret
I bet if you get drunk suddenly you'll be dead set
On getting it in
You mess with the gin
And you'll end up convinced you had sex with a 10
So full throttle
Order another bottle
And shot after shot will ransform her into a model
Mike posner on the refrain
'Cause you know beer goggles are hell of a thing

That ass makes me wanna oo-ooh
You know exactly what you do
How I'd really like to take that home
Everybody here knows... 

She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex [4x]
She looks like

When I crack a six pack and chase it with patron
Every girl looks like catherine zeta jones
So I show up to the club, and I stand at the door
Waiting on the perfect girl whose standards are low
I take jameson and take it with no shame
And change any dame to jenna jameson
Mike posner on the refrain
'Cause you know beer goggles are hell of a thing

That ass makes me wanna oo-ooh
You know exactly what you do
How I'd really like to take that home
Everybody here knows... 

She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex [8x]
She looks like

Break it down

Sex sex
She looks... 
Sex
Sex sex
Sex sex
She looks like sex
Sex, sex
She looks like sex
