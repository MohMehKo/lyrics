Every day day and every night night
I am gonna fight fight fight to win
(We're kickin' ass now)
Every day day and every night night
I am gonna fight fight fight to win
(We bring the house down)
Every day day and every night night
I am gonna fight fight fight to win
(We crush our enemies)
Every day day and every night night
I am gonna fight fight to win
(We bringin' to their knees)

I step in the arena
I get my knuckles crackin'
I try to keep it clean
But who knows what could happen
I see a long row, an ensemble
Of the best fighters from a combo of consoles

First came Ryu, a guy who cries (Hadouken!)
As he tries to fight you
I decked the dude in his chest
Just before I shocked Blanka
When I kicked the fool directly in his testicles
Sub-Zero felt the need to freeze me
Exsqueeze me?
That's cheesy
His ass left bleeding
I Falcon Punched Captain Falcon
Just as I Super Smashed Mario up in his mustache
Panda gets up in my face and I'm thinking
That I'ma have to beat him
'Til he's pleadin' for extinction
Leavin' knuckle imprints on his eyelids
And I ain't sayin' video games make me violet
But..

Every day day and every night night
I am gonna fight fight fight to win
(We're kickin' ass now)
Every day day and every night night
I am gonna fight fight fight to win
(We bring the house down)
Every day day and every night night
I am gonna fight fight fight to win
(We crush our enemies)
Every day day and every night night
I am gonna fight fight to win
(We bringin' to their knees)

C-c-c-c-combo breaker!
Awww. I think I'm hit bad
Life bar almost depleted

[DeStorm]
Tag and I'm glad that you passed it to me
Which one of the cowards
Wanna bring the beef?
If you wanna harm me, better bring an army
Step in my way and I'm smashing your feet
Throw the knife. Pass it to me
I'ma slash Jin down to the white meat
Then I'm calling out Ken
(Let's take it to the streets)
Then I'm breaking his back and I'm breaking his teeth
And my Chun-Li kick gotcha taking a seat
Kasumi did I catch you at a bad time?
You can try to run but your ass mine
Flatline!
Now that her ass is dying over there
I'm goin' after Kuma the Bear
Beat ya 'till you look like Yogi the Bear
Using my bare hands holding your hair
Where Scorpion at?
I'ma cause him harm
Death to Ayane though she a bomb
Hit her with a bomb
Whole lot of bombs
Bombs she the bomb
Bomb bomb bomb bomb
Heihachi came from Tekken trying to step into the game
But I couldn't pronounce his name
So I put my weapon through his chest frame
Ripped out Lizardman's tongue
He's dumb with silence
And I ain't saying video games make me violent
But..

Every day day and every night night
I am gonna fight fight fight to win
(We're kickin' ass now)
Every day day and every night night
I am gonna fight fight fight to win
(We bring the house down)
Every day day and every night night
I am gonna fight fight fight to win
(We crush our enemies)
Every day day and every night night
I am gonna fight fight to win
(We bringin' to their knees)

Ain't nothing like whippin' your ass (whippin' your ass)
'Cause I love whippin' your ass (I love ass)
Ain't nothing like whippin' your ass (whippin' your ass)
'Cause I love whippin' your,

I step back to the arena bringin' death
Who doubted me?
I'm ripping out Nightmare's spine (Fatality!)
The crowd cheers, shocked then silent
I ain't sayin' video games make me violent
But..

Every day day and every night night
I am gonna fight fight fight to win
(We're using cheat codes)
Every day day and every night night
I am gonna fight fight fight to win
(Our thumbs are bleeding now!)
Every day day and every night night
I am gonna fight fight fight to win
(We're stuck up in our rooms!)
Every day day and every night night
I am gonna fight fight to win
(We never rage quit!)
