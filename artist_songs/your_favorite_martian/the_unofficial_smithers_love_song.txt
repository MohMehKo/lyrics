Hey, Mr. Burns. You thought your money could buy you the world.
I said hey there, Mr. Burns. I happen to notice that you don't have a girl.

Smithers loves you, Burns. Why do you ignore him?
You gotta keep up the rapport like it's too important
Instead of running away, you should move in toward him.
But you keep him at the border like the dude is foreign.
We know you're straight, dude. I really hate to
Say there's no way anyone else would date you.
Straight out the gay scene. How do you face him
Knowing he wants to be your Malibu Stacy?

All he ever wanted to do was spend a little time with you.
Hey, Mr. Burns. Hey, Mr. Burns.
You know you're worth more to him than all the money you spend.
Hey, Mr. Burns. Hey, Mr. Burns.

Hey, Mr. Burns. I'm thinking maybe you should give him a chance.
I said hey there, Mr. Burns. Yeah, so what if he's a man.

We know you're blind, old man, but you can hear me talking.
You're always home alone. You ain't Macaulay Culkin.
You ain't a Flintstone. Pay no mind
To the fact that Smithers wants to have a gay old time.
And while relationships have their twists and turns,
You know he'll never leave you. Don't you, Mr. Burns.
So you should give him a shot, and maybe help the guy,
And you can make relations Santa's Little Helper style.

All he ever wanted to do was spend a little time with you.
Hey, Mr. Burns. Hey, Mr. Burns.
You know you're worth more to him than all the money you spend.
Hey, Mr. Burns. Hey, Mr. Burns
