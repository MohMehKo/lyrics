I like this girl so much
She's always on my mind
We have an awesome time
We never crossed the line
She don't wanna mess-up the friendship
“Friendsies”
I'm in a frenzy, 'cause my bedroom's empty
And I'm gently attempting to win her over
By being as good as friend as I can be
She's tempting but riddled with doubt
Friend Zone is like the mafia
You'll never get out!

Ya
She doesn't know the half
In my wallet I keep her photograph
I've made my decision
For you, Babygirl, I'd change religions
‘Cause in your eyes I see heaven
Girl, I think about you 24/7
Before this story ends
I wanna know can we be more than friends?

I put my hands up in the air
Try to act like I don't care
But tonight I'm all alone
Because now I'm in the Friend Zone

I'm in The Friend Zone
I'm in The Friend Zone
I'm in The Friend Zone
Now, I'm in The Friend Zone
Now, I'm in The Friend Zone
Now, I'm in The Friend Zone, Oh Ya

I go the blues 'cause we're not knockin' the boots
We're talkin' gossip news and shoppin' for shoes
I hate when you make me watch Sex and The City until the day ends
I'm not your gay friend!
But I'll do it, just to get next to you.
Just to prove I can best the rest the dudes
I'm obsessed with you. I pester you.
‘Cause when we ain't together, I'm probably texting you

Ohh!
You make me the maddest
I just want to change my Facebook status
To “in a relationship”
But “it's complicated”
Well you're makin' it hard for me
‘Cause I just can't walk away
I just can't walk away
I just can't walk away

I put my hands up in the air
Try to act like I don't care
But tonight I'm all alone
Because now I'm in the Friend Zone

I'm in The Friend Zone
I'm in The Friend Zone
I'm in The Friend Zone
Now, I'm in The Friend Zone

I know you don't notice, but there's no excuse
To date that other dude, he's a total douche
He's got a few broken screws, I'm so confused
That Imma have to show the dude
That you deserve better, and you know you do
Always feel free to cry on my shoulder. Boo
‘Cause if I ever go with you, I'm sure I'll stay
I wanna leave now, but I just can't walk away

I just can't walk away
I just can't walk away
(I just can't walk away)
I just can't walk away
(I just can't walk away)
I just can't walk away
(I just can't walk away)
I just can't walk away
(I just can't walk away)
I just can't walk away
(I just can't walk away)
I just can't walk away
I just can't walk away

I'm in The Friend Zone
I'm in The Friend Zone
I'm in The Friend Zone
Now, I'm in The Friend Zone

I put my hands up in the air
Try to act like I don't care
But tonight I'm all alone
Because now I'm in the Friend Zone

I put my hands up in the air
Try to act like I don't care
But tonight I'm all alone
Because now I'm in the Friend Zone

I'm in The Friend Zone
I'm in The Friend Zone
I'm in The Friend Zone
Now, I'm in The Friend Zone
