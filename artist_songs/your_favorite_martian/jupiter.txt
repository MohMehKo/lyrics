There’s nothing left to say
I’m not with you
You lie so far away from the truth

Jupiter you’re on my mind
The clock will turn the gears of time
I only wanna be with you
Symmetry can lean askew

It’s gripping on my mind
I’ll stay impossible to define while you’re away

There’s still nothing to say
I’m not with you
Sometimes the path least traveled is the avenue

The stranger in your life you thought you knew
How can I be yellow and still so blue?
I’m blue

Jupiter you’re on my mind
The clock will turn the gears of time
I only wanna be with you
Symmetry can lean askew

It’s gripping on my mind
I’ll stay impossible to define while you’re away, you're away

Jupiter you’re on my mind
The clock will turn the gears of time
I only wanna be with you
Symmetry can lean askew
