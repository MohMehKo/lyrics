Girl, you got class and you’re lookin’ so fine
But you need a better ass as I follow behind
You gotta go to Wal-Mart and get a new get-up
Or you can pay us
We’ll make your booty look better
’cause this store sells brand new asses
From the manufacturer straight to the masses
So if your booty’s flat, we’ll take it back
And give you a new ass, and you’ll make it clap like

Double Ds in the front and the back
You’ll redefine what it means to have a fanny pack
And everybody will stare and they’ll gawk astounded
We’ll give you an ass so big, you gotta walk around it
You can have knowledge, self-esteem, and class
But who needs all that when you gotta nice ass?

Girl, you need a new set of butt cheeks and I think we can help you out
We’ve got a store full of junk for your trunk and baby without a doubt
You could improve your personality but who the hell wants that
When you could buy your self esteem in the form of a brand new ass

Everybody say
