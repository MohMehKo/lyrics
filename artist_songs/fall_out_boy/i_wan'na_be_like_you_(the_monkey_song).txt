I'm the king of the swingers, the jungle V.I.P
I've reached the top and had to stop
And that's what bothering me
I want to be a man, man-cub, and stroll right into town
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeying around

Ooh-bi-doo, I wanna be like you
I want to walk like you, talk like you, too
You'll see it's true, an ape like me
Can learn to be human, too

Don't try to kid me, man-cub, I made a deal with you
What I desire is man's red fire to make my dream come true
So give me the secret, man-cub, hey, clue me what to do
Give me the power of man's red flower so I can be like you

Ooh-bi-doo, I wanna be like you
I want to walk like you, talk like you, too
You'll see it's true, an ape like me
Can learn to be human, too

Now here's your part of the deal cuz, lay the secret on me of man's red fire!

Ooh-bi-doo, I wanna be like you
I want to walk like you, talk like you, too
You'll see it's true, an ape like me
Can learn to be human, too

Ooh-bi-doo, I wanna be like you
I want to walk, I wanna walk, I wanna walk and talk like you
You'll see it's true, true!
An ape like me
Can learn to be human, too (yeah)
