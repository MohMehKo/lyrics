She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman 
And I can't get you outta my head

The stench, the stench of summer sex
And CK eternity, oh, hell, yes
Divide me down to the smallest I can be
Put your, put your v-v-venom in me

She wants to dance like 
She wants to dance like

I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
I'll keep you like an oath
"May nothing but death do us part"

She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can’t get you out of my head

The blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
Is worth two lions, but here I am
And I slept in last night’s clothes and tomorrow’s dreams
But they’re not quite what they seem

She wants to dance like
She wants to dance like

I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
I'll keep you like an oath
"May nothing but death do us part"
