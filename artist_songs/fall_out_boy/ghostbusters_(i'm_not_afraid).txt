(Ghostbusters!)
If there's something strange
In the neighborhood
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters!)
If there's something weird
And it don't look good
Who can you call?
(Ghostbusters!)

I'm calling
I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, not afraid
Ooh, I'm not afraid

Now who are you calling out, ca-ca-ca-calling out?
(Ghostbusters!)
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
Yeah, yeah
(Ghostbusters!)

If you're seeing things
Running through your head
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters!)
An invisible man
Sleeping in your bed
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters!)

Ooh, I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, not afraid
Ooh, I'm not afraid

Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters!)
If you're all alone
Pick up the phone and call
(Ghostbusters!)

[Missy Elliott:]
I can't sleep when I'm home alone
Night time my lights on
Woo, got me scared
Woo, hidin' underneath my bed
In my closet, down the hall
I see shadows all on my wall
Man, these monsters be big and tall
Ghostbusters, who you gon' call?
They roll up to my house (my house)
They knocking at my door (my door)
They come busting in, kill all them ghosts
There's somethin' strange in my neighborhood
Look out the window and it ain't too good
I ain't afraid, so let's get to it
Smoke these ghosts like backwoods

Listen, I'm not a- I'm not a-
I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, not afraid
Ooh, I'm not afraid, not afraid
Ooh, I'm not afraid

Now who you calling?
(Ghostbusters!)
Now who you calling out?
Now who you calling out?
Now who you calling?
(Ghostbusters!)
Now listen...

Bustin' makes me feel so,
Bustin' makes me feel so,
Bustin' makes me feel good!

I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, not afraid
Ooh, I'm not afraid!
