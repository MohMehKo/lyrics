We sold our souls in dark hotel rooms
We slip tongues and lie like "I will see you soon"
Two explorers in the dark making maps and drawing shots
Put the world on notice I'm ruined and I know it
We threw the game from the start
I'm desperate and devoted the secret no one told us
My songs know what you did in the dark

We sold our souls in dark hotel rooms
We slip tongues and lie like "I will see you soon"
Two explorers in the dark making maps and drawing shots
Put the world on notice I'm ruined and I know it
We threw the game from the start
I'm desperate and devoted the secret no one told us
My songs know what you did in the dark

We sold our souls in dark hotel rooms 
We slip tongues and lie like "I will see you soon"

Put the world on notice I'm ruined and I know it
We threw the game from the start
I'm desperate and devoted the secret no one told us
My songs know what you did in the dark
My songs know what you did in the dark

My songs know what you did in the dark
My songs know what you did in the dark
My songs know what you did in the dark
My songs know what you did in the dark
My songs know what you did in the dark
My songs know what you did in the dark
