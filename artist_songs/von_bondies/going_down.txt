One lost his way in the fame
The other one with his heart
The last one wasn't that simple
Yeah, You could tell right from the start

He had attitude like the Devil
Lips that speak the truth
He had the soul of an angel
He could see it in her, too
He could see it in her, too

Well, She ain't no Cinderella
And he ain't no flashy king
But if she keeps on treating him right
He's going to make that mockingbird sing
But if she treats him bad
He's going to send her on her way
Making her pay for all his troubles
'til her dying day
'til her dying day

She's going down
She's going down
She's going down
I'll send her on her way

She's going down
She's going down
She's going down
I'll send her on her way

She's going down
She's going down
She's going down
I'll send her on her way

She's going down
She's going down
She's going down
I'll send her on her way

She's going down
She's going down
She's going down
I'll send her on her way

She's going down
She's going down
She's going down
I'll send her on her way

She's going down
