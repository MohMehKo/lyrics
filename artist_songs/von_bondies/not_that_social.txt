I'm the centre of whats getting you near
But if you wanna, you better come quickly 
You're not that social, just a good drinker 

I know a way, to make things better 
Do i mean it, or am i just mean 
You're not that social, just a good drinker 

Ahh ah ah ah ah ah 
Ahh ah ah ah ah ah 

Theres no limits to the problems you bring 
You need help, and i need the chance and its on its way 
You're not that social, just a good drinker 

I've been hinting for a long long time 
You'll never make it, this is the end 
You're not that social, just a good drinker 

Ahh ah ah ah ah ah 
Ahh ah ah ah ah ah
