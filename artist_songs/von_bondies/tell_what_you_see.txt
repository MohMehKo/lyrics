Everything is perfect 
Until I get your phone call 
Telling me something I said or did 
That wasn't even my fault 

When will I know it's the end 
When there's nothing left for me and you 

Then it gets much much worse as the day goes on 
I hear rumors of lies of my name 
Being dropped by the friends that I once loved 

When will I know it's the end 
When there's nothing left for me and you 

Well take a good look 
And tell me what you see 
I got a bad feeling about a thing or two 
And the way life's supposed to be 
With your ... life you choose 
You take the fun out being a lead 
Nothing to lose 
When is nothing .. 

When there's nothing left for me and you 
[until end]
