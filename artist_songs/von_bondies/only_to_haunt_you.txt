Ride for me
Just don't whore me
Blood depends,
Make ponderings of me
Won't you stay a little longer
You find pain where most find pleasure

Whoa ohoh
Only to haunt you
Whoa ohoh
Only to haunt you
Whoa ohoh
Only to haunt
You, it's true, it's you

She's not honest
The maddest one
Makes her kill when she needs to run
She don't mean it
She's good for the start
Begs and pleads when I break her heart

Whoa ohoh 
Only to haunt you
Whoa ohoh
Only to haunt you
Whoa ohoh
Only to haunt
You, it's true, it's you
Only to haunt you

Care for me
Just adore me
Revel in these words that sold me
Passed the night
Dressed in silence
Silence fills these thoughts with violence

Whoa ohoh
Only to haunt you
Whoa ohoh
Only to haunt you
Whoa ohoh
Only to haunt you
Whoa ohoh
Only to haunt you

Whoa ohoh
Only to haunt you
Whoa ohoh
Only to haunt you
Whoa ohoh
Only to haunt
You, it's true it's you

She's the baddest one
Only to haunt you
Maddest one
Only to haunt you
Baddest one
Only to haunt
You, it's true, it's you
Only to haunt you
