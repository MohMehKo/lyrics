How can I be down when I ain't been buried yet?
Ah-ooh ah-ooh
I smoke a cigarette, I ain't got no regrets
Ah-ooh ah-ooh
How can I be down when I ain't been buried yet?
Ah-ooh ah-ooh

Making snow angels to the break of dawn
Ah-ooh ah-ooh
Lying with ..... 'cause I don't give a d**n
Ah-ooh ah-ooh
Making snow angels to the break of dawn
Ah-ooh ah-ooh

Me and my brother ain't got no sister
just a bother at home
So we got two bottles of nite train, baby
And now we don't feel alone
Me and my brother ain't got no sister
Just a bother at home
