You buried me in a shallow grave
One without no name
You poisoned my rivers
Just to try and keep me tamed
You were my shadow of darkness
Keeping out all the light
You cut off my lifelines, baby, to try and see if I'd fight

Feeling this heartache of mine

I walk around all over town hoping that I'd find the one
But as fate would have it, I know you are the one
So I shed off this shadow to you, hoping that you'd see it, too
And I'll wait and I'll wait for the darkness to come on through

Feeling this heartache of mine
