With her head in the clouds now
She's sad over nothing
I said, 'girl you're delicious'
In a bar, now

I don't wanna be this way anymore
I don't wanna be this way anymore

I have bad inhibitions
On the floor, now
I swear this is serious
Make you smile, now

I don't wanna be this way anymore
I don't wanna be this way anymore

She's on the outside
Pay no attention
Show me your wild side
Good stimulation
Take me for part time
High on your hear say
Fighting for my sake
Ah, ah, woo!

I don't wanna be this way anymore

I said 'find me an innocent'
So many questions
Tell me I just need
A fair intervention
She's in a [?]
More of a headway
Make me a marked man
Ah, ah

I don't wanna be this way
I don't wanna be this way
I don't wanna be this way anymore
