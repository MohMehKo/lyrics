I've been set up like the innocent. 
I've been swank 
And I'm lovin' it. 

I've been alone like a little kid. 
I've been swank 
And I'm lovin' it. 

I've been swank 
And lovin' it. 

Oh no - it's a sin! The Jury's in. 
Doesn't look like I'll be doin' it again. 
Cause I've been swank 
Been swank - and lovin' it. 

I've been swank 
And lovin' it. 

The nights are cold 
The nights are long. 
I'm alone and I've been alone all along. 
I've been set-up like the innocent. 
I've been swank 
And lovin' it. 

I've been swank 
And lovin' it. 

I've been swank...and lovin' it
