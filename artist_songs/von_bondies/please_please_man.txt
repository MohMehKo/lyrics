Do you like the way I walk?
Do you like the way I talk?
Do you like me at all?

I'm your please-please man, baby
So don't ever let me go

I've been sleeping on your doorstep, girl
So don't ever try to come home

Please, please, yes
Please, please, no
I've been sleeping at your door
So don't ever come home
