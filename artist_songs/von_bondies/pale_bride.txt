Here she comes
My pale bride
Makes it so that I don't try anymore
All dressed in white
Sad to see that I don't care anymore

Don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
Don't care anymore
I don't

She's so kind
And on my mind
Fantasy that I can't fake anymore
A lullaby
Makes me wanna spend more time with you

Don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
Don't care anymore
I don't

And she dies
And she dies
And she dies
And she dies

All alone
And on the pain
Pay no mind that I don't care anymore
And on your way
Take your time to read what's on the wall

Don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
Don't care anymore
I don't

And she dies
And she dies
And she dies
And she dies
