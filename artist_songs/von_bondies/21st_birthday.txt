So, wait
Drink more wine
Do all the things
I'm feeling fine

Can't stay awake so you say goodnight
So long career
So long dear life

Never gonna live to see your 21st birthday
Never gonna have to see your pretty face again

And so it's back to the game
Its always more of the same
You never see it will be better my way

I can't take this no more
She's always facing the floor
There's nothing worse than an unhappy soulmate

Never gonna live to see your 21st birthday
Never gonna have to see your pretty face again

Twenty years old and I feel alone
With lies, trust burned away
No fun in living
Just die, yeah

So go
I'll feel better
You came to pay
I'll see that door
Closing another day

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

So, wait
Drink more wine
Do all the things
I'm feeling fine

Can't stay awake so you say goodnight
So long career
So long dear life

Never gonna live to see your 21st birthday
Never gonna have to see your pretty face again

Never gonna have to see your pretty face again...
