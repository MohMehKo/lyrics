If you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind
Oh bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me

Ooh yeah

You know I laughed
When you left
But now i know
I've only hurt myself
Oh bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me

And money too
And thats not all
I'll do for you
Oh bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

You know I'll always be your slave
Until i'm dead
And buried in my grave
Oh bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

If you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind
Oh bring it to me
Bring your sweeet lovin'
Bring it on home to me
