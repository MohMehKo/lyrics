You feel buried, you feel bored 
No one takes u seriously when ur 24 
So shut off ur days 
And turn on ur nights 
'cause the chance is for the taking 
And the taking's right 

No you really haven't lived life yet 
No you really haven't lived life 
If you ain't got no regrets 

What I did last night 
Is none of your concern 
You know I feel right 
But that's none of your concern 

No you really haven't lived life yet 
No you really haven't lived life yet 
If you ain't got no regrets 
If you ain't got no regrets 

Don't be mistaken 
For someone who cares 
Oh no, Oh no you wouldn't dare 
Your the path here, 
The pawn i took, 
The sacrificial lamb, 
The spineless book 

Oh no you really haven't lived life yet 
Oh no you really haven't lived life yet 
If you ain't got no regrets 
If you ain't got no regrets
