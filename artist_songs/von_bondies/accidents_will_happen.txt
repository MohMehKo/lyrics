She set herself on fire, I was burnt from head to toe
Please don't tell anybody, I can't bare them you know
She says it all for show
Makes me crazy, I didn't really wantna know
I'm a bleeding heart, there's no doubt about it

Oh no, oh no, I've done it again
Oh no, oh no, she's phoned up her friends
Oh no, oh no, she's not stopping
'Cause there's no stopping 'til the tears start dropping again

There's an accident old boy, I lost all self-control
Can anybody hear me? Anybody save my soul?
It's far too dead aside, to go on living a lie
I just don't need that bad kind love
That strips you from the inside

She says it's all for show
Takes romance and breaks it down to the floor
She's got a big black heart there's no doubt about it

Oh no, oh no, I've done it again
Oh no, oh no, she's phoned up her friends
Oh no, oh no, she's not stopping
'Cause there's no stopping 'til the tears start dropping again

Oh no, oh no, she's done it again
Oh no, oh no, she's phoned up her friends
Oh no, oh no, she's not stopping
'Cause there's no stopping 'til the tears start dropping again

There's no stopping, no there's just no stopping
No stopping, no there's just no stopping
There's no stopping, no there's just no stopping
'Cause there's no stopping 'til the tears start dropping again
