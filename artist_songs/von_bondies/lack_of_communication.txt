Well,tear down the Mona Lisa
Put your picture on the wall
Tell the world you love her
And i'm at your beck and call
And i'm the only Mona Lisa and
baby [x4]

Baby, I didn't mean you no harm
I just had some fun with some friends
I mean some girls in the city
Don't we get along?
Yeah,Don't we get along?
Yeah, don't we get along with our friends in the city?

Lord, I've been praying all day
Just take this pain and give it away
Don't leave no other witnesses
By the grace of God, I'm going to see you in Hell
