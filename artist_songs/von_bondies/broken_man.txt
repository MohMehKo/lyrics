I'm a broken man 
This here's my broken band 
From a broken land 
We take the good, the bad 
Yeah 

I'm a broken man 
From a broken land 
This here's my broken band 
From your hand 
Yeah 

I'm a broken man 
This here's my broken band 
From a broken land 
We call Detroit City 
There's no blood on these hands 
That's why we came to take a stand 
We take the good, we take the bad 
It's all we ever - 
It's all we had 
Yeah 

I'm a broken man [x6]
