Crawl through the darkness, fear all that don't, fate is a gift [x2]

Can you see the eyes and the daggers that follow? 
Anything and everything that stand in the way 
Wait, please wait, to the boy who hears the father 
Reaching for his hand as his heart starts to sway [x2]

Crawl through the darkness, fear all that don't, fate is a gift [x4]

Truth by truth you'll break men in town 
What makes a man drink 
And another man cry 
If not a gift 
No change to make way 
Through these fine hours of a our lonely lives 
Through these fine hours of a our lonely lives 

Crawl through the darkness, fear all that don't, fate is a gift [x4]

I need to be alone, I'm halfway to nowhere 
More 'n the cold on now that I am alone 
Wait means wait, to the boy and his father 
Raching for a hand as my heart starts to sway [x2]

Crawl through the darkness, fear all that don't, fate is a gift [x5]
