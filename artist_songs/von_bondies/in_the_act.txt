I know where your girl was last night
She didn't put up too much of fight
More like a plea for somebody who had some time

Me and her, we were sitting and talking
Just planning on making something
That's about when I told her to rearrange her life

She got pissed and splashed a drink in my face
More like a plea for a more moral case
Why don't you go home and try to be a better wife?

Stemming from a life of seduction
Headed out by a life of precautions
Then you'll go home and try to be a better wife
