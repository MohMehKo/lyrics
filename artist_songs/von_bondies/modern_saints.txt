Oh baby won't you wait
Until you're old enough
So grace and please don't
Make me take your name in vain
You're calling up the pain

So please don't
Make me suffer
Please don't
Choose another
Please don't
Celebrate
Only she'll
Decapitate now...

Baby won't you wait
Till we are old enough
So great, so please don't
Make me take your name in vain
So calling off the pain

So please don't
Make me suffer
Please don't
Choose another
Don't
Compensate
It only seems
To complicate now

So the days
Turn to nights
Ripping my life away
Whats in store?
Take my hand
Close that door
Tearing my heart away
Evermore

Turn the nights
Say goodbye
[?]
[?]
Take my hand
Say goodnight
Take the days
Evermore...
