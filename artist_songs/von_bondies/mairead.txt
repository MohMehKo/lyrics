Oh, Mairead 
Your love is beyond compare 
You have streaks of ivory hair 
Two lips I wouldn't dare - 
Oh, Mairead 
Sweet, sweet Mairead 
Love of my life, Mairead 
Oh, Mairead [x3]

It's your oasis 
Stroke of the pen 
It's your hive of friends, baby 
Tell me, is this the end? 
Oh, Mairead 
Oh, sweet Mairead 
Love of my life, Mairead 
Oh, Mairead [x3]

You hide behind an icy stare 
Do you even care? 
Well I'm here, well I'm there 
Oh, Mairead 
You sucked my dry 
Took all my will to live 
Look at me, oh look at me, Mairead 
Sweet Mairead 
Sweet, sweet Mairead [x2]

Oh, Mairead 
You took every - every ounce of my love 
(Let me put there)
I think I've had enough 
Oh, Mairead 
You said it was true love 
You said it was everything you ever wanted 
You said - said lies 
You said lies 
Oh, Mairead 
Take me for a fool 
Oh, Mairead [x2]
Took everything and let me never forget
