I'm the fly on flypaper
You're the rain on the web
Resurrected by demons
All shoutin' in my head
Its the lifeboat of sanity
The beacon in the dark
Let all hell's fury play the rhythm of your heart

Its the sound of terror
Its the sound of terror

It sleeps with the fear
All burrowing under your bed
Waiting for a signal
To bring this nightmare to and end
Its an affair of honour
Taken too far
Lets burn down st peter's and drive a stake through it heart

Its the sound of terror
Its the sound of terror
