I need a hard-headed woman with her
head on straight
'Cause my heart's been broken from too 
long a wait

Well, I fear kind of lovin'
No foolish games
I'm feeling California
But's it's so far away

For your lovin'
Real lovin'

I don't need no sugar mama
to pay my bills
I've got twenty dollars just to
fill my thrills

But needing and wanting are two seperate 
things
The only difference is you can but all those
things

For a real kind of lovin'
No foolish gamess
I'll move to California
So you're not far away

For your lovin'
Real lovin'
For your lovin'
