Yeah, Crying
Yeah, Sleeping
Yeah, Kicking
Yeah, Keeping
All this pain inside of me

There ain't no monetary value, baby
Just heart and soul
Hustle us down to the river, child
Let it take control
Holding on to the chaos scene, Yeah
Pink ribbons and bows
Just stick with the rhythm, child
It'll save your soul

Geraldine, let it take control
Geraldine, let it save your soul

Yeah, Crying
Yeah, Sleeping
Yeah, Kicking
Yeah, Keeping
All this pain inside of me
