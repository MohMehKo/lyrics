First thing I do:
Start a revolution
Built around me and you

Who are we to know the game
To freedom?
Dead to say, built between them
Kept aghast
Kept aghast

Well who can blame him for trying?
Oh, oh
I have to keep him from lying
Oh, oh
Hey

The next thing I do
Is stop watching the clocks
Cos everyone knows that time is fleeting
Open your ears and hear the pleading

Echoes of voices, fighting for years
Ringing with hatred, growing each fear
Dead to say, don't turn my way...

Well who can blame him for trying?
Oh, oh
I have to keep him from lying
Oh, oh
Hey
Well who can blame him for trying?
Oh, oh
I have to keep him from lying
Oh, oh
Hey

Last thing I do
Is tear away these scars
Paranoid, bleeding as bright as the night
Dancing with pain, with pain, with pain

Well who can blame him for trying?
Oh, oh
I have to keep him from lying
Oh, oh
Hey
Well who can blame him for trying?
Oh, oh
I have to keep him from lying
Oh, oh
Hey, hey, hey
