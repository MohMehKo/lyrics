What you need is to take a chance 
Dancin' days are a thing of the past
Mix it up and make her go
Just to let her know
This is the night to let it show

And if your feeling wounded
Don't waste your time move right away
'Cause fallin' down isn't that far to go
Just to let her know 

(Hey now, hey now, take it to the other side)
You don't look so cool, but you look so alive
So alive 
So oh oh oh oh oh oh oh alive 

(Hey now, hey now take it to the other side)
You don't look so cool but you look so alive 
So alive 
So oh oh oh alive 

What you need is to take a chance
Dancin' days are a thing of the past
Mix it up and make her go
Just to let her know
This is the night to let it show

Wave her down on the dance floor
You can't keep movin' anymore
Just scream out loud and we'll all see your pain 
We all feel the same

(Hey now, hey now, take it to the other side)
You don't look so cool but you look so alive 
So alive
So oh oh oh oh oh oh oh alive 

(Hey now, hey now take it to the other side)
You don't look so cool but you look so alive 
So alive 
So oh oh oh alive
