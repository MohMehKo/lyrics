Oh it's party time!
This what we've been waiting for
You ready?!
You ready?!

Take me under your wings
Let's fly to the sunrise
Sunrise
Hold me tight in your arms
You're making me feel alive
So alive

Like stars in the night sky
You shine for me
Light me up like fireflies
And lightning

Cause all we have is
Now forever
Go hard while
We're together
To the moon we go
Running wild like wolves forever
Turn up the night together
To the moon we go
To the moon we go

When I look in your eyes
That's when I get
Butterflies
Butterflies
Live wild like we won't die
Get lost in your
Paradise
Paradise

Like stars in the night sky
You shine for me
Light me up like fireflies
And lightning

Cause all we have is
Now forever
Go hard while
We're together
To the moon we go
Running wild like wolves forever
Turn up the night together
To the moon we go

She goes by the name Sofia
And I go by the name Khleo
Yeah
Let's go!
Turn up
Pull an all-nighter
Set the party on fire
Love in the air
Hands in the sky
Life taking us higher
Let me see you on the dance floor
With your whole crew
Acting hella crazy
Let me see you on the dance floor
If you down to dance
Then grab a lady
Music knocking through the speakers
We go hard don't need a reason
DJ turn it louder
Tonight we got the power
Hey its your birthday
It's your birthday
If this party was a race
You in 1st place

All we have is
Now forever
Go hard while
We're together
To the moon we go
Running wild like wolves forever
Turn up the night together
To the moon we go
To the moon we go
