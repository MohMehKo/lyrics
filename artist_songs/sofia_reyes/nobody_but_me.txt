[Sofia Reyes:]
This ain't enough
Might be too much
Maybe we're just foolish now
Stuck here in love
What's so hard to figure out
We both know that we care

[Prince Royce:]
Girl I don't mind spending my time
Learning all the perfect ways
To hate you with love
I'll be counting down the days
'Till I don't need you

[Both:]
Just don't let nobody but me
Break your pretty heart to pieces
Give us time to see what we could be
Even if we choose to leave it
High, selfish, so weird
Cause I'd rather be here healing with you
Too far, foolish
I'll be there
Cause that's just me
When it comes to you

[Prince Royce:]
Too close, too right
Too far for more
I don't wanna wait too long
To kiss you tonight
Any second will be gone
A life for we, for us

[Sofia Reyes:]
So terrified
Knowing I might lose
Who I'm supposed to be
To be by your side
Falling from this gravity
With you, you just love for pride

[Both:]
Just don't let nobody but me
Break your pretty heart to pieces
Give us time to see what we could be
Even if we choose to leave it
High, selfish, so weird
Cause I'd rather be here healing with you
Too far, foolish
I'll be there
Cause that's just me

Before we say yes
Before we say no
Before we hold on
Or decide to let go
Let's make it worth it
I hope you'll worth it
Cause I'll be your fool
I'll be your best friend
I'm crazy for you
This love is so reckless
But if we letting go
Just let me know

But just don't let nobody but me
Break your pretty heart to pieces
Give us time to see what we could be
Even if we choose to leave it
High, selfish, so weird
Cause I'd rather be here healing with you
Too far, foolish
I'll be there
Cause that's just me
When it comes to you
