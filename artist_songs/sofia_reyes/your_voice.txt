Just got home, all alone
Boy I'm missing you
I check my phone, one missed call
I see it's from you
You've been gone way too long
Hate when you're away
One voicemail, I can't wait to hear what you're gonna say

Sounds like a song
Sounds like a secret
Like a million memories
I close my eyes and I hear a heartbeat
That you still beat for me
And it's your voice, your voice shooting down my dreams
And it's your voice, your voice ending you and me

Your voice
Your voice
Your voice
Ending you and me, you and me

I can't breathe, I can't speak
My world is crashing down
I call you back, you don't pick up
My room is spinning round
I can't believe that, it feels so unreal
That you're really making it end
So I press replay just to hear you say it again, and again, and again

Sounds like a song
Sounds like a secret
Like a million memories
I close my eyes and I hear a heartbeat
That you still beat for me
And it's your voice, your voice shooting down my dreams
And it's your voice, your voice ending you and me

You and me
I thought we would be you and me eternally

Sounds like a song
Sounds like a secret
Like a million memories
I close my eyes and I hear a heartbeat
That you still beat for me
And it's your voice, your voice shooting down my dreams
And it's your voice, your voice ending you and me

Your voice
Your voice
Your voice
Ending you and me
Your voice
Your voice
Your voice
Ending you and me, you and me
