We pull up in beat up jeans, got no pennies but a pocket full of dreams
Looking a rock star millionaires
We don't give a [?], baby let 'em stare
Jam to the rhythm of the beat
Following the sneakers on our feet
We don't have a clue where we're gonna go
Hey, it's okay, we don't wanna know

We can have it all if we want to
Baby, anything that we can to
We're bigger than the trouble that we go to
We don't give a damn

Baby, love is free
Just like you and me
All the posh and blink
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing
We're young and free, just like one, two, three
Don't care what they think
It don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing to me
It don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing to me

We like a little bam, bam, boom
Catching all the ice in the room
Gonna live it up, can't keep it down
Gonna make it pop with the... sound

We can have it all if we want to
Baby, anything that we can to
We're bigger than the trouble that we go to
We don't give a damn

Baby, love is free
Just like you and me
All the posh and blink
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing
We're young and free, just like one, two, three
Don't care what they think
It don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing to me
It don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing to me

We just want some fun
And we want it while we're young
If you wanna come get some
We can have it all night long
We just want some fun
And we want it while we're young
If you wanna come get some
We can have it all night long

We can have it all if we want to
Baby, anything that we can to
We're bigger than the trouble that we go to
We don't give a damn

Baby, love is free
Just like you and me (just like you and me)
All the posh and blink
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing (don't mean a thing to me)
We're young and free, just like one, two, three
Don't care what they think
It don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing to me

It don't mean a thing to me
It don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing to me
It don't mean nothing
It don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing to me
