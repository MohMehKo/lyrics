Make me crazy, don't speak no sound
I want you to prove it to me in the nude
Addicted to the way you move

Honey, if anything ever should change in you
Don't worry I'm standing still
I'll move in with the right of will

This is the highest cost, take you and make you off
Love you and leave you lost, will you forgive me?
Asked out all over town, drags you and keeps you down
Two times in a day around, will you forgive me?

I can't control the feeling girl 'cause I know you're here
I feel you from the floor to the ceiling
Girl, I feel you when you comb your hair

Lady when we lock it low we get together, it's an overdose
I'm slipping, I'm here, I'm on my knees
I feel my heart's about to explode

This is the highest cost, take you and make you off
Love you and leave you lost, will you forgive me?
Asked out all over town, drags you and keeps you down
Two times in a day around, will you forgive me?

Baby to tell the truth when I'm sober I jones for you
When it's over I'm overdue
Girl there's no one as bad, no one as bad as you

You got me, you got me
You got me slippin' around with it, around with it, oh why?
You got me sick with this love baby
I'm so, I'm so in love, I can't come down

This is the highest cost, take you and make you off
Love you and leave you lost, will you forgive me?
Asked out all over town, drags you and keeps you down
Two times in a day around, will you forgive me?

You're my bad habit baby, you're my
You're takin' my soul down to the letter O
Can't escape the way you got me locked out baby
I gotta break from you, break from you, break from you

This is the highest cost, take you and make you off
Love you and leave you lost, will you forgive me?
Asked out all over town, drags you and keeps you down
Two times in a day around, will you forgive me?

Will you forgive me? Will you forgive me?
Will you forgive me? Will you forgive me?
Asked out all over town, drags you and keeps you down
Two times in a day around, will you forgive me?

I can't control the feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling
I can't control the feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling
I can't control the feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling
I can't control the feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling

You're my soul, soul
You're my soul, soul
