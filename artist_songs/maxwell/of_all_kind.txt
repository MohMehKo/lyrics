I never felt the fame
I never won the game
If I had a wedding ring
You would be the only thing
That I

Wanna be where you are the spirits go
If the end should come I sure hope they know that

I love you like there's no end in sight
You're like a God in my mind
You're a highest high of all kind

Oh
If I could help it I would take your place instead
I just wanna end the pain baby
I just want you back again
Because I

Wanna be where you are the spirits go
If the end should come I sure hope they know that

There's no end in sight
You're like a God in my mind
You're a highest high of all kind

Never alone you surround me with your soul
Every where I go
You're around me and you know
Cause I love you like you're like my life
You're a God in my mind
You are of all kind

I love you like there's no end in sight
You're like a God in my mind
You're the highest high of all
I love you like there's no higher site
You're like a God in my mind
You're the highest high
Of all kind
Of all kind
You're a highest high
Of all kind
Of all kind
You're the highest high of all kind
I love you like there's no end in sight
You're like a God in my mind
Of all kind
All kind
All kind
You're the highest high of all kind
