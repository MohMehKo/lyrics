I wanna love you, baby

Say that you'll be with me
Don't leave me, I'm in vain
Cause I've been lost for too long
Don't you go
Don't you leave me
Cause I've been lost for so long
So long
So long

When I see you from a distance
When I see how you ignore with resistance
And I know you have been
And your children are growing up
And your husband is loving you
I don't know if I can go on
Cause I've been so...
So lost
I've been so...
So lost
So lost
So lost
So lost

In the waking hour
In the middle of the night
When the moon is not just full
I see you in my eyes
I see you and it haunts me
And you tore me
And you haunt me

Cause I've been so...
So...
So lost
