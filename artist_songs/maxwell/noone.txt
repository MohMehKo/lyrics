If i had to do it over
If i had to do it again
Oh, i wouldn´t know too
And this would´ve never began (no it wouldn´t baby)

Oh, if i made you claustrophofic
Imagine if i gave you an inch
Oh, you´ll never know this
But there´s noone quite like, noone quite like you

[2x:]
I try to forget ya
But you´re all i wanna do
Oh, i can do better
But there´s noone quite like, noone quite like you

If i made you love me again 
if i made you love me again
If i made you want it again
If i made you want it again
If i gave it you probably wouldn´t want it baby
It´s alright
´Cause there´s noone quite like you

I try to forget ya, said i try
But you´re all i wanna do
Oh, i can do better (i can do better)
But there´s noone quite like, noone quite like you

I try to forget ya (try to forget ya)
But you´re all i wanna do
Oh, i can do better (i can do better)
But there´s noone quite like, noone quite like you

I try to forget ya (try to forget ya)
But you´re all i wanna do (i´m what you want)
Oh i can do better (i can do better)
But there´s noone quite like, noone quite like you

..Oh, like you...Try to forget ya...Do what i wanna do...
...Uh, i can do better...

I try to forget ya
But you´re all i wanna do
Oh, i can do better
But there´s noone quite, noone quite like you
