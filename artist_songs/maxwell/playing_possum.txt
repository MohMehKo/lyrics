Come back from the dead
You left my, my heart here
Say what you will and won't forget

Express disappointment
Speak your regrets, yeah
Or baby call out my name
I'll be where you are, I'll be very still

Step down to my heart and mend this broken
If only you'd wake up from your constant possum playing
If only you'd wake up

I'm begging you sugar, have some leniency
Call the president and ask him baby
To pardon me and bring you back to me

Amend this broken
If only you'd quite this nonsense of your possum playing
If only you'd wake up, wake up baby, wake up baby
