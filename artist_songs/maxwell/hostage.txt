You are the harvest
Your garden helps to feed me
I am your hostage
A simple logic
Use as you please
And I will remain ignorant and believe you
Foolish me, I can see through you

You are the object
I get lost in, all in
I'm in, fallin', high stakes
I am free
Baby

And let her stay from thee
I'm turning up
Like a rocket in the sky, we'll take it all off
To a place where pure discretion is the means
Where the universe is yours and made for you
If you want my love, I will surely go

You are the object
I get lost in, all in
I'm in, fallin'
High stakes, I am
Object I get lost in, all in
I'm in, fallin'
High stakes, I am free

If your keys were left, I would never go, yeah
Stay within the confines of your warmth
I'm free inside the cage of your heart of gold
Prison of your love, it makes me so
I'm your hostage
You are my love
