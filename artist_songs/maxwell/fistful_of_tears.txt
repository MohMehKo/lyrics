Feel just like a weight has lifted it 
How can I repay you help me understand 
Currency a fistful of tears I can afford 
Fight of your life is not the cost 
Time will reveal 
All along you're the one who's losing 

Cause I go insane 
Crazy sometimes 
Tryin you to keep you from losing your mind 
Open your eyes 
See what's in front of your face 
Save me my fistful of tears 

You can make it disappear girl 
All you got to do is just raise up, face up, stay up 
All things will heal we'll feel it with a kiss from the skies 
Don't' you let it go 
Don't' you let it go 

Cause I go insane 
Crazy sometimes 
Tryin you to keep you from losing your mind 
Open your eyes 
See what's in front of your face 
And save me my fistful of tears 

We gon fight the war 
We gon fight our fears 
The only thing I wanna throw is a fistful of tears 
We gon fight the war 
We gon fight our fears 
The only thing I gotta throw is a fistful of tears 
We gon fight the war 
We gon fight our fears 
The only thing I wanna throw is a fistful of tears 

Cause I go insane 
Crazy sometimes 
Tryin you to keep you from losing your mind 
Open your eyes 
See what's in front of your face 
And save me my fistful of tears 

Cause I go insane 
Crazy sometimes 
Tryin you to keep you from losing your mind 
Open your eyes 
See what's in front of your face 
And save me my fistful of tears
