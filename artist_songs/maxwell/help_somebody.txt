There's a moving inner peace that I love to see
Gotta raise my soul to tell you how I feel
Gotta listen to the tears that people cry for me
In a world that's so wild fear creeps

'Cause when I get up to hear you tears just fill my eyes
Now I know I got to let the selfishness subside
Tell 'em y'all

Help somebody, help somebody
Show them what it is, give a little bit more
Help somebody, help somebody
Show them what it is, let 'em know

If you see the future ask it if I'm there
Ask it if I'm there

Ask it to tell you did I ever make a stand
Ask if you may care to mention, did I learn from everything?
And even if it takes a sea of eternity to know
I'll wait a century, a buried mess of bones, help me

Help me to give myself the way that you've given you
Help me to be the helping hand that makes a dream come true
Choir sing

Help somebody, help somebody
Show them what it is, give a little bit more
Help somebody, help somebody
Show them what it is, let 'em know

If I'm there, tell me if I'm there
Do you see me there?
...

Help somebody, help somebody
Show them what it is, give a little bit more
Help somebody, help somebody
Show them what it is, let 'em know

If you see the future ask it if I'm there
Ask it if I'm there
