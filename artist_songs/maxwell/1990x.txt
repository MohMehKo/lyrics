Like the thunder, I can hear you whisper
If love was shown, if love was shown I would be more brave
If I can see anything I wanna entertain
But I can't. I'd rather have you next to me
But can you see that I'm alone?

There's no hesitation.
I feel you so much
There's no indication
That I will choose your touch

There's no song that defines it
There's no music behind it
There's no lyric to read from
There's just you and the moment

Lay here closely beside me
Feel my heart as it's pounding
We will climax with reason
'Cause we're grown and we own it

Inside the sky of me and you lives a star
Let's ride the galaxy and find who we are

I'm hearing them saying things all the time
The word on the street is that I'm slowly losing my mind
They say that he's wasting his whole life

There's no song that defines it
There's no music behind it
There's no lyric to read from
There's just you and the moment

Lay here closely beside me
Feel my heart as it's pounding
We will climax with reason
'Cause we're grown and we own it

When the night is through
The morning rays of love I see you through
'Til the morning dew, yeah,
A winter afternoon
A summer night in June,
Whatever works for you
Time goes by
It just can't be more than my love, love
