Cross your fingers, babe
Take ya time, don't stress about the minor things
If it wasn't meant to be

Maybe your love is just a big mistake
Maybe our love was just a world away
If you get the courage baby
One day, someday, probably, maybe
You'll be mine, all mine
Let me love you right, all night
All night, oh, oh

Cross your fingers, babe
I know sometimes, your love is pessimistic
Oh, baby, baby

Maybe your love is just a big mistake
Maybe your love is what you fabricated
If you get the courage, baby
Someday, maybe, probably, maybe
You'll be mine, all mine
Oh, you'll be mine, mine, mine

But you're not the kind
You have no time
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh

Cross your fingers, babe
I know sometimes, your love will only trick me
Oh, why would you let this go by?

They can tell you anything to change your mind
There's no mystery and you're not blind
Fingers crossed, you'll make the choice to make you mine
Make you mine, oh
Someday, maybe, probably baby
You can do it
Baby, you will be mine
All mine, all mine, all mine, all mine
Maybe you'll let me be your kind
Someday, maybe, probably, maybe
Maybe, someday, probably, baby
If you get the courage, lady
You, you, you
