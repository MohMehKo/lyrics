Days go by slowly
I never know wholly
I see what you owe me
You never realize
That everything changes
And everything moves
And nothing is as it
Was when you lose

The thoughts you feel
The way it's real
Completely sealed
My heart revealed, my mind is healing

And when you're gone, see my heart
Time it just rages
And it goes in stages
Feel like I'm average
The pressure's so savage
Bark away habits
But only if you're here
The love, I can feel it
The thought of you being
Closer than reason
And further than seasons
And closer than seasons

When does the summer fall?

Wait, wait, wait
Wait
Waiting for the...
Feel me for waiting so long
For taking the time to rise and destroy
I was avoiding the thing that I...
I can't feel you

Spring, winter, summer, fall
Forgive me
Spring, winter, summer, fall

Time, it just rages
Spring, winter, summer, fall
Time, it just rages
Love goes in stages
Spring, winter, summer, fall
Waiting for the fall
Love goes in stages
Waiting for the fall
Love goes in stages
