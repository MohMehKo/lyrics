Listen, hear, baby
Listen close, hear
Cause nothing here is gone
The thing still strong
Whenever things go wrong
Whenever things go left
You can be in charge
Cause I won't regret the way that I feel yet
And nevertheless, I'm here for you
And you're the one, the only thing that makes me want to stand up for you and me
To stand up for you baby

Cause nothing is wrong
Nothing is wrong
Everything's right
We're gon' be strong
We gon' be strong

Listen hear
Pay attention, my dear
Open your eyes see me more clear
I'm confusing at times, sometimes I might lie
I'm scared and I'm shy
To show you just how weak I am
Because sometimes I am not the kind of man I would like to be

Can't you see
I'm scared afraid
Destroyed be everything that I might un-make

There's a hole inside, there's something in me that tries to destroy it tries to deny the
Destiny that I've been given
Because the life I've chosen is not the life that I should be living
Oh listen, hear
Listen, hear
Nothing is wrong
