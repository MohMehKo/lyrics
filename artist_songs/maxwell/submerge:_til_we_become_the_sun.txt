Over to under
Enter your wonder, baby
Submerge into me, baby
And take me to higher

[Chorus:]
Submerge within the light
Illuminate my night
Let your atmosphere surround me

Submerge within the light all night
'Til we become the sun
'Til we become the sun

See if I'm breathing
Cause I'm not sure tonight if I'm alive
Words are demeaning they can't describe

[Chorus x2]

Oh, my God
'Til we become the sun

Submerge within the light
Illuminate my night
Let your atmosphere surround me

Submerge within the light all night
'Til we
'Til we become the sun

[Chorus x3]

Submerge within the light all night
'Til we become the sun
'Til we become the sun
