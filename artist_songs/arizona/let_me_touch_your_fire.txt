I've got a cold heart, cold hands
I make you want to be where I am
And if you only knew my plans
Oh if you only knew who I am

Normally, I'd break your heart
I'd love every minute, tear you apart
Woo hoo hoo hoo
Woo hoo hoo hoo

Late at night I lie awake
Just thinking about your pretty face
Woo hoo hoo hoo
Woo hoo hoo hoo

I've got a cold heart, cold hands
I make you want to be where I am
And if you only knew my plans
Oh if you only knew who I am

Normally, I'd break your heart
I'd love every minute, tear you apart
Woo hoo hoo hoo
Woo hoo hoo hoo

Late at night I lie awake
Just thinking about your pretty face
Woo hoo hoo hoo
Woo hoo hoo hoo

I'll never leave you on the wire
So let me touch your fire
Oh, I'm cold, sick and I'm tired
So baby, let me touch your fire

I'll never leave you on the wire
So baby, let me touch your fire
Oh, I'm cold, sick and I'm tired
So let me touch your fire
