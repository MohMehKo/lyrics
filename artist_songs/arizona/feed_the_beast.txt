I spent half my life looking for you
Just to find you here on a Friday night in the city
Ain't no way I could ignore you, no
Oh but if I feed the beast, it will wake up to come out and get me

Out here in the wild
Just strangers in the night
Oh I've been looking for you
To bring me back to life
So come a little bit closer
And I promise I won't bite
Until you get me home
And bring out the beast inside

Oh make my heart beat, beat
Come on and feed the beast
Make my heart beat, beat
Come on and feed the beast
Make my heart beat, oh oh
Come on and feed the beast
Cause I need no sleep, no sleep
So come on and feed the beast

I'd forget myself just to know you
Underneath all of the shining lights of the city
Ain't no other way to show you
So baby feed the beast, oh it's starting to come out and get me

Out here in the wild
Just strangers in the night
Oh I've been looking for you
To bring me back to life
So come a little bit closer
And I promise I won't bite
Until you get me home
And bring out the beast inside

Oh make my heart beat, beat
Come on and feed the beast
Make my heart beat, beat
Come on and feed the beast
Make my heart beat, oh oh
Come on and feed the beast
Cause I need no sleep, no sleep
So come on and feed the beast

Come on and feed the beast
Come on and feed the beast
Make my heart beat, oh oh
Come on and feed the beast
Cause I need no sleep, no sleep
So come on and feed the beast

Dancing with the fire, oh oh
Standing on the edge, oh oh oh
Oh we get a little tied up, ooh ooh
In each other's heads, other's heads

Oh make my heart beat, beat
Come on and feed the beast, oh oh
Come on and feed the beast
Make my heart beat
Come on and feed the beast
Cause I need no sleep, no sleep
Come on and feed the beast
