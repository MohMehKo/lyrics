Though I left you in a bad way
Never call you back and you always say
"Why you gotta go and dim the round to just like that?"
Baby I know that you can't take
The long nights and the heartbreak
But I always know you're gonna be coming runnin' right back

It's okay, to get stuck in the game
A little insecure, baby we're one and the same, woah
Oh, oh, oh-oh

Annie, don't leave me hanging
Oh, those big cold eyes that you're hiding behind
Oh, I can see through 'em every time, oh, oh
Annie, girl you know that I need you
Oh I love it when you smile
Won't you stay for awhile?
I promise everything is gonna be fine, oh, oh

Everything is gonna be fine, oh, oh
Everything is gonna be fine

I know it gets a little frantic
Trying to keep up with all the antics
Oh, I know you get so sad
I hate to see you like that
Oh-oh, oh-oh
But you're a rebel, I'm a bandit
Now we're ramblin' the abandoned
Let's just burn it all down, baby, never look back
Oh-oh, oh-oh

It's okay, to get stuck in the game
A little insecure, baby we're one and the same, woah
Oh, oh, oh-oh

Annie, don't leave me hanging
Oh, those big cold eyes that you're hiding behind
Oh, I can see through 'em every time, oh, oh
Annie, girl you know that I need you
Oh I love it when you smile
Won't you stay for awhile?
I promise everything is gonna be fine, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I promise everything is gonna be fine, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

We've both been here before
So before you walk out the door
Know it's just that game we play; the one we're both good at
I'm saying everything about you
But girl I wouldn't be so sure
So let's just find a way, oh, oh

Annie, don't leave me hanging
Oh, those big cold eyes that you're hiding behind
Oh, I can see through 'em every time, oh, oh
Annie, girl you know that I need you
Oh I love it when you smile
Won't you stay for awhile?
I promise everything is gonna be fine, oh, oh
