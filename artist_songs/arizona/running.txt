Oh we'd rather live a lie, live a lie
Then face all the heartache
So we live in the warmths of the nights
And sleep through the dark days
Does it even really matter?
Don't even want to get better
Cause it feels like we're fighting for nothing, nothing

So we keep on
Running, running, running, oh oh
Always hunting something, oh oh
They take our hearts
Then leave all the noise behind
People
Running, running, running, oh oh

We're doing alright, we'll be fine
Everything's okay
That's what we tell ourselves all the time
We can't make the pain go away
We can't slow down, we can't stop now, but we all turn around, oh oh
Even if it feels like we're fighting for nothing, nothing

Yeah, we keep on
Running, running, running, oh oh
Always hunting something, oh oh
They take our hearts
Then leave all the noise behind
People
Running, running, running, oh oh

Hiding away from ourselves
We never get too far
We can't stay, can't stay still
We don't want to do this anymore
Find a way to just let go
Turn around, and just get gone
And after all, you're fighting for something, something

So keep on
Running, running, running, oh oh
Always hunting something, oh oh
They take our hearts
Then leave all the noise behind
People
Running, running, running, oh oh

It feels like you're fighting for nothing
People
