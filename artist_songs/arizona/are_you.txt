Black heart, black eyes
Oh I feel alive
But this chaos hiding in my eyes
Always shouldn't trust me, and you know why
But there's no use in trying to hide

Oh I don't wanna hurt you
I just wanna open up your heart
Come a little closer
Don't be so afraid of a couple scars
Cause I don't wanna hurt you
I just wanna open up your heart
Come a little closer
I know you're not afraid of a couple scars

Don't be afraid, now you don't have to cry
It's getting dark out baby, come inside
Those noises in your head come alive
No there's no use in trying to hide, oh

Oh I don't wanna hurt you
I just wanna open up your heart
Come a little closer
Don't be so afraid of a couple scars
Cause I don't wanna hurt you
I just wanna open up your heart
Come a little closer
I know you're not afraid of a couple scars

Oh the night is dark and cold
And who knows, maybe I can steal your soul
But you're not one to believe in superstition, superstition, oh
Are you, are you, oh
Are you, are you, no
Are you, are you, oh-oh
Are you, are you, oh

Hurt you
I just wanna open up your heart
Come a little closer
Don't be so afraid of a couple scars
Hurt you
Open up your heart
Come a little closer
Afraid of a couple scars
