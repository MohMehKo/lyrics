Pause all these words, pause all these words that we keep hearing with
Who said it first? Who said it first? Let's not go down like this
Take your pain, take all of the emotions that you feel
Give 'em all to me

Oh, I-I-I, I wanna get lost in the night now
Hold me in the dark, turn the lights down
And give me your electric touch
Oh, I-I-I, I don't wanna think about the distance
I just wanna be in your existence
So give me your electric touch, oh
Give me your electric touch, oh

All the things, remember all the things we used to do
Give into me, give into me and I'll give into you
If you need it, or if you need to win, then I will lose
If it brings me back to you

Oh, I-I-I, I wanna get lost in the night now
Hold me in the dark, turn the lights down
And give me your electric touch
Oh, I-I-I, I don't wanna think about the distance
I just wanna be in your existence
So give me your electric touch, oh
Give me your electric touch, oh
Give me your electric touch, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So give me your electric touch, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Give me your electric touch, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Give me your electric touch, oh oh
