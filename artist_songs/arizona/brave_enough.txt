I, I hold myself hostage in your arms
I, I know I could leave whenever I want
And I see the way you look at me in the night
And I know you know that something isn't right

I've been telling myself
To love myself before I love you
But I needed your help, I needed your help
Just to pull me through
And now that we're here
Tell me what am I supposed to do
I'm not brave enough to lose
You

You, you lay with your pillow on my lap
Now, now I feel like there's no going back
And now I feel like now my heart is torn
Cause all you see is sunshine baby
But I'm bringing all the storms

I've been telling myself
To love myself before I love you
But I needed your help, I needed your help
Just to pull me through, oh oh
And now that we're here
Tell me what am I supposed to do
I'm not brave enough to lose
You
You

I've been telling myself to love myself before I love you
I needed your help, needed your help
Just to pull me through, oh oh
And now that we're here
Tell me what am I supposed to do
I'm not brave enough to lose
You

Not brave enough to lose
You
Not brave enough to lose
