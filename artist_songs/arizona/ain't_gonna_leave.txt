I fight myself, I fight everything
To make you who I want you to be
And I keep coming back for more
Through the fires and my fantasies
So what if I don't know what to do?
Don't care too much about the truth, the truth
Oh, I learn the hard way

You could be alive with a pretty face
But I believe, I choose to believe
Oh, I can be crazy, but that's okay
I'm in love with everything that's bad for me

Now here we have a world we don't understand
But really, how bad could it be?
I'm gonna stay here with you baby
Stay here with you baby
I, I, I ain't gonna leave
And I, I, I ain't gonna leave

I put your lips on a pedestal
Even if they suck the life out of me
Oh I can't stand to be in bed alone
Cause I can't dream away happily
Wide awake and staring at the door
What is fair in love and war?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, I learn the hard way

You could be alive with a pretty face
But I believe, I choose to believe
Oh, I can be crazy, but that's okay
I'm in love with everything that's bad for me

Baby we have a world they don't understand
But really, how bad could it be?
I'm gonna stay here with you baby
Stay here with you baby
And I, I, I ain't gonna leave, oh
And I, I, I ain't gonna leave, oh
And I, I, I ain't gonna leave, oh
I, I, I ain't gonna leave

Draw the pictures in my head of you and I
Fall in love before the ink is dry
And unto all the words that you might never say
As it gets me through my day
Oh, and every single time I think about you
Baby, I get shaken up, oh I can't breathe
You can do anything you want to me baby

And I ain't gonna leave-eave
Oh, I ain't gonna leave
I ain't, I ain't gonna leave
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And I, I, I ain't gonna leave
And you can do anything you want to me baby
Oh I ain't gonna leave
