I gave my all that day, gave me, I gave it all away
I wanted you to stay, stay with me, wanted us to play
In the backyard of your place, under northern lights
You fucked me up that night, under northern lights

I wanna dance again, baby
I wanna dance, dance
Don't wanna fall again, this time
I wanna dance, dance
I just wanna
I just wanna
I just wanna dance

We never left that place inside my head
If hurting wounds could mend, I'll be ok, I'll be ok
In the backyard of your place, under northern lights
Ain't no going back, ain't no going back

I wanna dance again, baby
I wanna dance, dance
Don't wanna fall again, this time
I wanna dance, dance
I just wanna
I just wanna
I just wanna dance, dance
I just wanna
I just wanna
I just wanna dance, dance, dance

In the backyard of your place, under northern lights
Ain't no going back, ain't no going back
No more northern lights, no more northern lies
Ain't no going back, no more northern lights
