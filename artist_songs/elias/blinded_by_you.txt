Cut up on broken dreaming, now I'm bleeding
Running back to you, back to you
Made to be wrong for each other, I tried another
Another, fade like ghosts they do, close to you

Somehow I get blinded by you
Blinded by you
Blinded by you
Somehow I get blinded by you
Blinded by you
Blinded by you

Swallow my pride I'm trying, justifying your lying
Being used by you, it feels so true
All of your exes, dealers, unbelievers
They don't fucking care for you, like I do

Somehow I get blinded by you
Blinded by you
Blinded by you
Somehow I get blinded by you
Blinded by you
Blinded by you

I can't stop dreaming of you
Dreaming of you
I can't stop dreaming of you
Bring me down
Bring me down

I can't stop dreaming of you
I can't stop dreaming of you
Bring me down, baby
Bring me down

Somehow I get blinded by you
Blinded by you
Blinded by you
Somehow I get blinded by you
Blinded by you
Blinded by you

No matter how hard I try
I'm always running, all the time
Running back to you
Running back to you

No matter how hard I try
I'm always running, all the time
Running back to you
Running back to you

No matter how hard I try
I'm always running, all the time
Running back to you
Running back to you

I can't stop dreaming of you
Dreaming of you
I can't stop dreaming of you
