Keeping one eye open. Sleeping with the enemy.
I see no heart in the frozen dark, that ever speaks to me.
Would you cut me from the branches? Release me from the chains?
Ain't nobody coming home to me, since you've gone your way.

Every time I lay down. Shut my mind, but I see you,
Green eyes in the night. The rain in your hair, as you run for your life.
Running through the storm.
Running through the storm.
I see you, a curse in my mind. Coming to hurt me, you're holding me tight.
Never coming home.
Never coming home.

Dancing with the loveless. Barefoot we are screaming in the dark.
Fill our lungs with our acid tongues, but it only breaks apart.
Would you cut me from the branches? Release me from your chain?
Ain't nobody coming home to me, since you've gone your way.

Every time I lay down. Shut my mind, but I see you,
Green eyes in the night. The rain in your hair, as you run for your life.
Running through the storm.
Running through the storm.
I see you, a curse in my mind. Coming to hurt me, you're holding me tight.
Never coming home.
Never coming home.

Won't you set me free? My dreams, they don't belong to me.
I say, why won't you set me free? My dreams, they don't belong to me.
I see you, see your golden teeth in the dark.
The rain in your hair, so perfectly calm.

Never coming home.
Never coming home.
Never coming home.
Never coming home.
