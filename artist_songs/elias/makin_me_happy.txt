I've been lying here one
Did you sleep last night
All my doors they came knocking, one to one
I've been searching for something
Keep you off my mind
But however you're fucking, one to one

I remember your smile
When you said you're making me happy
And no matter what you do
You're the only one that makes me feel happy, happy

I've been lying here one
Did you sleep last night
All my doors they came knocking, one to one
I've been searching for something
Keep you off my mind
But however you're fucking, one to one

I remember your smile
When you said you're making me happy, happy
And no matter what you do
You're the only one that makes me feel happy, happy

I remember your smile
When you said you're making me happy, happy
And no matter what you do
You're the only one that makes me feel happy, happy

You can swallow all the diamonds, baby
If it makes you feel happy, happy
You can swallow all the diamonds, baby
If it makes you feel happy, happy

I've been lying here one
Did you sleep last night
All my doors they came knocking, one to one
I've been searching for something
Keep you off my mind
But however you're fucking, one to one

I remember your smile
When you said you're making me happy, happy
And no matter what you do
You're the only one that makes me feel happy, happy
