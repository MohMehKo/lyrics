I've been counting days
I've been drowning nights
Now you wonder if you are
Still on my mind
It's a little too late
To be nice
So you wonder if you are
Still on my mind

When I, when I'm thinking of trouble
God knows I'm thinking of you
When I'm falling down
When I go out of my mind
God knows I'm thinking of you
God knows I'm thinking of you

After all this time
I still feel the pain
When you left me all alone
To take the blame
Did you run out of love?
Or just run out love?
Still got a heart-shaped bruise
That's how I remember you

Thinking of you (Don't you ever forget)
Am I thinking of you? (That I'll never forget)
Thinking of you (I can check in from my memory)

When I, when I'm thinking of trouble
God knows I'm thinking of you
When I'm falling down
When I go out of my mind
God knows I'm thinking of you
God knows I'm thinking of you

Don't you ever forget
That I'll never forget
Don't you ever
Don't you ever forget
That I'll never forget
Don't you ever

When I, when I'm thinking of trouble
God knows I'm thinking of you
When I'm falling down
When I go out of my mind
God knows I'm thinking of you
God knows I'm thinking of you
