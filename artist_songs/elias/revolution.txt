Falling
We are falling now
Words written down
They are falling now

But the lies they will hurt you
Hold on
Human kindness desert you
Hold on

Let's start a revolution
How beautiful
It is
Let's start a revolution
How beautiful
It is (revolution)

Running with a crown on your head
A resolution
Written on your hands

And the lies they will hurt you
No more
Human kindness desert you
No more

Let's start a revolution
How beautiful
It is
Let's start a revolution
How beautiful
It is

City's on fire but it's beautiful
Revolution
City's on fire, won't you burn it all?
Revolution
City's on fire but it's beautiful
Revolution, revolution

(Oh, oh, revolution)

Let's start a revolution
How beautiful
It is
Let's start a revolution
How beautiful
It is

(Oh, oh, revolution)
(Oh, oh, revolution)
