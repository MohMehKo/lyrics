Out of the blue you stole me
Into the dark you took me
Colors shine for all but me, here I go
And I've been gone for so long
Oh you finished me off
Put me out of my misery [?]

Oh you all gone by
Cause I gotta see the low
Only thing gets me high

The only thing that gets me high
When I'm up here
Nothing got a hold of me
The memories don't trouble me
Yeah when I'm high, for a while
I know you gonna let me down
I know you gonna leave me down 'n' out
I know you gonna leave me down 'n' out

I was a happy child, I
Ruler at my playground
2015 just hit me
Hey now here we go
I knew right when I saw you
I just had to have you
Put me out of my misery [?]

Oh you all gone by
Cause I gotta see the low
Only thing gets me high

The only thing that gets me high
When I'm up here
Nothing got a hold of me
The memories don't trouble me
Yeah when I'm high, for a while
I know you gonna let me down
I know you gonna leave me down n out
I know you gonna leave me down n out

I can't breathe without you
I can't sleep without you
2015 just hit me
Hey now here we go

When I'm high
When I'm up here
Nothing got a hold of me
The memories don't trouble me
Yeah when I'm high, for a while
I know you gonna let me down
I know you gonna leave me down 'n' out
I know you gonna leave me down 'n' out
