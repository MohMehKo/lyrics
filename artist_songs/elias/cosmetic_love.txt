Smoke out that window, white through the hall
My name is not under another, cosmetic love
Gunshot my head, white through the hall
Won't need no other lover, perfect fall

Fill me up with something, fill me up
Fill me up with something, fill me up

Anything for high
Anything for high
I do
Anything for high
(Fill me up)

Collect all them pictures, words falling through
Clouds been over and it's all about you
Forgive our faces when we burn
Clouds been over and I'm not under you

Fill me up with something, fill me up
Fill me up with something, fill me up

Anything for high
Anything for high
I do
Anything for high
(Fill me up)

Cosmetic love
Cosmetic love
Cosmetic love
Cosmetic love
(Fill me up)

Make me go blind
To what I must find
Still I will find
You make me go blind

Make me go blind
To what I must find
Still I will find
You make me go blind
