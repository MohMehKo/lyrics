I'm walking in this cloud
In this cloud, upon love
But still I feel this doubt
Feel this doubt, about us

I'm walking in this cloud
In this cloud, upon love
This road can't be mine, can't be mine

Giving it up, oooooh
Giving it up, giving it up

Stand down, drop these weapons now
We're walking in this lie, walking in this lie
You know I try, try to compromise
We're walking in this high, walking in this high

We are pushed back and down
I'm out of my mind otherwise
We are pushed and fallen down
Into this crowded space

Giving it up, oooooh
Giving it up, giving it up

Stand down, drop these weapons now
We're walking in this lie, walking in this lie
You know I try, try to compromise
We're walking in this high, walking in this high

Stand down, drop these weapons now
We're walking in this lie, walking in this lie
You know I try, try to compromise
We're walking in this high, walking in this high
In this high, walking in this high
