Up all night
Up all day
Sleep-deprived
A little insane
Smoking up
The beats rain down
Lightning strikes
Before your eyes
Just to let it out
Just to let it out
Just to let it out
Just to let it out
Just to let it out
Just to let it out
And we all bleed for something
Yes we all bleed for someone
And we all need something real
Future thrives
In open space
What still comes
From new flames
The past holds on
In endless ways
Guns and thunder
Release the waves
Just to let it out
Just to let it out
Just to let it out
And we all bleed for something
Yes we all bleed for someone
And we all need something real
(Want it, need it, get it, got it, tuck it away)
(Want it, need it, get it, got it, tuck it away)
We all bleed for something
We all bleed for someone
We all need something real
Need this, gotta have it
I am dead without it
Need this, gotta have it
I am dead without something real
