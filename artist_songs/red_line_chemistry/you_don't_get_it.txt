Watch yourself it’s a trick on the other side
But the illusion gets you high
A trip in the hole, it’s out of control
Renders you powerless to fight
Drawn to the wonder you might find
Heedless of all the warning signs
And you wanted it all
Now you’re taking the fall
You don’t know why

Oh yeah
You want it all but you just can’t get it
I said
You’re bleeding out now your facedown in it
Now the charade you paraded was all in vain
You really don’t care really don’t get it
No one to blame, it’s a shame that you let it go
You really don’t care really don’t get it, No

Through the glass is your past everybody’s dead
All that surrounds you spins your head
And how could you know a friend from foe
Amid all the cunning of disguise
Down here there ain’t no space in time
Only a lonely twisted mind
You don’t want anymore
Now you’re broke on the floor
You don’t know why

Oh yeah
You want it all but you just can’t get it
I said
You’re bleeding out now your facedown in it
Now the charade you paraded was all in vain
You really don’t care really don’t get it
No one to blame, it’s a shame that you let it go
You really don’t care really don’t get it at all

No it’s never enough for you
Never enough
No it’s never enough for you
Never enough
Never enough for you
Now leave it alone

Oh yeah
You want it all but you just can’t get it
I said
You’re bleeding out now your facedown in it
Now the charade you paraded was all in vain
You really don’t care really don’t get it
No one to blame, it’s a shame that you let it go
You really don’t care really don’t get it
