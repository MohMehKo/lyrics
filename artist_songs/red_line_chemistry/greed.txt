I did not do a goddamn thing 
Why the hell you trippin’ on me 
I was the one, said we should run 
But ya pulled out your gun and fuckin’ shot everyone 
Now there’s blood on your hands 
And the shit hit the fan 
Authority came and checked your life 
The battle was on 
But I was already gone 
You couldn't catch me if you tried

No money for you
More money for me 
Catch me if you can 
No money for you 
More money for me 
All's fair in war and crime I'll do no time 
Say goodbye  

I bet you’re pissed as all can be 
Cuz you're stuck, locked up and I'm free 
Out on the run, getting’ it on 
Like a mean little motherfuckin’ son of gun 
Now I'm taking it all, 
Never taking the fall 
Living it up I can't complain 
You're sittin’ for life 
And I'm fuckin’ your wife 
There ain't a damn thing you can say  

No money for you 
More money for me 
Nothin’ you can say 
No money for you 
More money for me 
All's fair in war and crime 
I'll do no time 
Say goodbye  

No money for you 
More money for me 
Catch me if you can 
No money for you 
More money for me 
Nothin’ you can say  

No money for you More money for me 
Catch me if you can 
No money for you 
More money for me 
All's fair in war and crime 
I'll do no time 
Say goodbye  

No money for you 
There ain’t nothin’ for you
