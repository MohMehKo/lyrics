You, know, how to win
You and me were stuck like glue then
Now we can't get far enough away
I don't believe a single word you say anymore
I cannot trust in anything you do

And so
It goes dear friend
The end gives in
Never to be saved

Pull down your halo
Shining in everyones eyes
While the devil
Is running around, spreading your lies
Go run and hide, you'll never survive
How do you sleep at night?

You are just another pretender
Can't believe I didn't notice before
You don't get my sympathy
There's nothing I can do but watch you bleed
Now that the damage has been done

And so
It goes dear friend
The end gives in
Never to be saved

Pull down your halo
shining in everyones eyes
While the devil
Is running around, spreading your lies
Go run and hide, you'll never survive
How do you sleep at night?

How do you sleep at night?

Broken...
Broken...
Hopeless...
Hopeless...

Broken
And Unspoken
And its hopeless
Rebuilding what was lost

Pull down your halo
shining in everyone's eyes
While the devil
Is hiding inside,
Tugging and pulling your halo
Slowly, you're blinding the stars
While the devil
Is running around, spreading your lies
Go on and hide, you'll never survive
How do you sleep at night?

How do you sleep at night?
How do you sleep at night?
How do you sleep at night?
How do you sleep at night?

How do you sleep at night?
