Living coma take me in
Paralyze and numb the skin
Death on Monday
Down a fifth on Tuesday
Church on Wednesday save me now
Banging on the big door
What the hell ya good for
Never leave a widow at home
Woke up in the night to fight the sweat and kill the pain
She was right beside me but I think 
I might be slipping away

It won’t be long and down we fall
Cuz living a life insane kills us all
And I prey tonight on piece of mind
This vicious cycle’s mine

Round and round I go
In vicious cycles
Always find my way
To let you down
Tumble like a ragdoll
Put me through a brick wall
Pull me up I’ll do it again
So disoriented like I’m caught up in a maze
Afraid of all the demons always 
begging me to come out and play

It won’t be long and down we fall
Cuz living a life insane kills us all
And I prey tonight on piece of mind
This vicious cycle’s mine

Vicious cycles drag me in
Rise so high then fall again 
Tumble like a ragdoll
Stumble through a brick wall
Humble me deliver the pain
Banging on the big door
Hanging on for one more
Maybe paranoid but I think I might be going insane
Down we fall

It won’t be long and down we fall
Cuz living a life insane kills us all
And I prey tonight on peace of mind
This vicious cycle’s mine
This vicious cycle’s mine
This vicious cycle’s mine
