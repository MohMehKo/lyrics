We got something mighty fine
But I can’t take it when we fight
Love is the hardest thing
We’re learning to mend the strings
Burning sheets with our desires
Buries a man that makes her cry
Love is the hardest thing

Where do we go
When the fire’s burning low
Feel like I’ve been here before 
The fire’s burning low
Let’s take it farther, 
farther from the wrong
Oh yeah we roll on

We got love without a home
Couple of dreams it’s all we own
Looking to find a way
Tomorrow’s another day
She got patience while I try
Thinking I’ll keep her till I die
But love is the hardest thing

So where do we go
When the fire’s burning low
Feel like I’ve been here before 
The fire’s burning low
Let’s take it farther, 
farther from the wrong
Oh yeah, against the odds we roll

Where do we go

We got something mighty fine
From high to the low we make it right
But love is the hardest thing
To keep on the road

Oh where do we go
When the fire’s burning low
Feel like we’ve been here before 
The fire’s burning low
Now take it farther, 
farther from the wrong
Oh yeah, against the odds we roll

Where do we go
