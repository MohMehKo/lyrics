Holed up forever 
Inside the winter of your dream 
Light the fire 
Take back the loss of revelry 
Dark days devour 
Removes the light from everything 
Crack the window 
Pull back the shade and let it rise  

Let it rise 
And you’ll find 
That the sun will free your mind 
Take the shell of a man 
Put some faith in his hand 
Come on out of the hiding 
Where ever you go 
You should know 
We’re the ones you call your own 
All the pain and love 
The grenades and drugs 
Yeah we’re all in the fire  

I’ll wait for you if you believe 
In the fire rising 
Tomorrow burn your suffering 
And the sun will rise again  

Self served destruction 
State of complete emergency 
Medicated 
Shut down the world outside and run  

Let him run 
From the sun 
Far away from everyone 
Where the grace of a man 
Turns to dust in his hands 
Come on out of the hiding 
Where ever you go 
You should know 
We’re the ones you call your own 
All the pain and love 
The grenades and drugs 
Yeah we’re all in the fire  

I’ll wait for you if you believe 
In the fire rising 
Tomorrow burn your suffering 
And the sun will rise again  

And the sun will rise again 
And your eyes open wide to the sky 
And you finally decide not to lay down and die 
Ride with the tide you believe you can fly 
Then you soar out of your mind 
I’ll wait for you if you believe 
In the fire rising 
Tomorrow burn your suffering 
And the sun will rise again
