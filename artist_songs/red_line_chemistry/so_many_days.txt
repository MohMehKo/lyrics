Lay right down 
Dream about the life we have found 
It's only just begun 
And we know we bring to light 
What most can never find 
And finally, we’ll be alive 
Still we ask ourselves 
Is it worth the trip through hell

So many days 
Come and go to waste 
While I wait for you 
I see you here 
And everywhere I go 
While I wait for you 
And ya know that I’ll wait for you  

Take my words 
It's all we get for now 
But rest assured 
We've only just begun 
And the seasons all will change 
But we'll remain the same 
And finally, we'll be alive 
Then we'll know damn well 
It was worth the trip through hell

So many days 
Come and go to waste 
While I wait for you I see you here 
And everywhere I go 
While I wait for you 
And ya know that I’ll wait for you 
And ya know that I’ll wait for you
