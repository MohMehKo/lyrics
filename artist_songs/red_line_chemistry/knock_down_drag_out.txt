Drag it on too long 
And you’re bound to come undone  

You want reaction go on and do what you need   
Yeah suit yourself it’s all the same to me  

Back and forth you run 
But the pain remains unsung  

You want reaction go on and do what you need 
Yeah suit yourself it’s all the same to me 
No more distraction go on and do what you need
This knock down drag out’s over and now I can breathe   

Well my regard ain’t high 
And I don’t mind 
Open your eyes 
The lies are my disguise 

You want reaction go on and do what you need   
Yeah suit yourself it’s all the same to me 
No more distraction go on and do what you need
This knock down drag out’s over and now I can breathe 

No more lying
No more trying
No more dying
No more faith in you
