Johnny my brother I won’t let you die 
Fuck this city man let’s roll tonight 
Are you coming? 
Thinking it’s over and look what you find 
A one-way ticket to a better life 
We’ve gotta burn this town 
And your pain will fade on out  

Remember when the summer was ours 
Always time to get high 
Never had a worry and the music was our life 
Playin’ all our favorite songs 
Yeah we’d burn out the night 
Thinkin’ ‘bout the glory we we’re dreamin’ of the fame  

Johnny my brother your life passing by 
Kick back, drink it up, and roll the dice 
Are you coming?
She got a demon inside of her eyes 
Legs wide open at a show tonight 
She’s gonna tear your heart out

Remember when the summer was ours 
Always time to get high 
Never had a worry and the music was our life 
Playin’ all our favorite songs 
Yeah we’d burn out the night 
Thinkin’ bout the glory we we’re dreamin’ of the fame 
We were so young and out of our heads

Remember when the summer was ours 
Always time to get high 
Never had a worry and the music was our life 
Playin’ all our favorite songs 
Yeah we’d burn out the night 
Thinkin’ bout the glory we we’re dreamin’ of the fame 
We were so young and out of our heads 
Come on Johnny come alive
