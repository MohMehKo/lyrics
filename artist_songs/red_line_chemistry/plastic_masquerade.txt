The old man, he broken 
He on the street no sign of change 
He had it made, he went astray 
Aint got no one but himself to blame 
He movin' on, the vagabond 
He gotta live just for today 
He'll never figure out 
What the game is all about  

All the people hang their heads 
Terrified to stand out 
Knowing that they wasted away 
All the riches that they had 
Never meant a thing   
Now they're stuck inside a never-ending nightmare all alone

The little girl, she was a pearl 
Until she strolled out in the world 
The other day, she run away 
She turnin' tricks got bills to pay 
She working hard, the boulevard 
Stuck on her back all night and day 
She'll never figure out 
What the game is all about  

All the people hang their heads 
Terrified to stand out 
Knowing that they wasted away 

All the riches that they had 
Never meant a thing  
Now they're stuck inside a never-ending nightmare all alone  

A never ending nightmare all alone 
A never ending nightmare all alone 
Is anything ever gonna change  
The young man, don't need a plan 
He let the trust fund pave the way 
He rollin' â€˜round, the underground 
With all the rich kids on parade 
They on a plain, the cocaine 
Some kinda plastic masquerade 
They'll never figure out 
What the game is all about

All the people hang their heads 
Terrified to stand out 
Knowing that they wasted away All the riches that they had 
Never meant a thing
Now they're stuck inside a never-ending nightmare all alone

Is anything ever gonna change
Will anything ever change
