Thinking much too hard and breaking the flow
Once again
Constantly recycling these things that will never change
Always re-igniting flames that were out
Smoldering fires just leave well enough alone
One more day
To turn it around
One more try
So beautiful now
It's time to start again
Making this so hard with every breath
Settle down
Focus on the changes one by one
Taking them on under the lights
That shine on what you can't control
One more day
To turn it around
One more try
So beautiful now
It's time to start again
Focus on what is yours now
Cause what's theirs
It just doesn't matter anyway
Anyway
One more day
To turn it around
One more try
So beautiful now
It's one more day
To turn it around
One more try
So beautiful now
It's one more day
