Sucker punch drunk dizzy love
The great scape for the taste of something new
Holding on trying to let it go
Running scared unaware what I'm running to

And when the consequences come
I'm climbing up the walls
And it's a long long way to fall

Flying high just to kill in time
Such a wreck I neglet to follow through
They are around when you're coming down
Out of space ain't no place to ground your mind

And when the consequences come
I'm climbing up the walls
And it's a long long way to fall

You will say the worst of me
I was on my knees
You can take the best of me
Don't you say it's all a part of me
