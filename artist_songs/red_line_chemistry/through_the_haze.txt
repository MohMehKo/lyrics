Falling down again
Falling down again
Falling down again
I feel the fire burn
Night after night
I hide from the light
That only reveals you're no longer in sight
Waking to find it was all just a dream
All just a teasing view through the glass
Where time doesn't pass
Patience and reverie laid on the grass
Soaking the sun when our feet left the ground
Floating, but now we're falling down again
Falling down again
I feel the fire
Feel the fire burn
Feel the water pouring down on you
Feel the fire burn
Feel the terra firma under you
Once more
Day after day
I try to replay
The memories before they give way to the haze
Like begging your mind to remember a dream
As real as it seemed, it's gone in a flash
It fades into black
The harder you try, well it pushes you back
And keeps moving faster to leave you behind
It won't let you fly, you're falling down again
Falling down again
I feel the fire
Feel the fire burn
Feel the water pouring down on you
Feel the fire burn
Feel the terra firma under you
Once more
Falling down again
Falling down again
I feel the fire
Feel the fire
Fuel the fire
Feel the fire burn
Feel the water pouring down on you
Feel the fire burn
Feel the terra firma under you
Once more
Once more
