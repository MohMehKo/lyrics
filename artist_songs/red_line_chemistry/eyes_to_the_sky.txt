There's no way to get out
And there's no way to stay in
And I'm stuck in the middle of everything
Stuck in the middle of everything I wanna be
I don't wanna be a part of this
I can't stand to be apart from this
I'm so divided...
I'm stuck in the middle of everything
Stuck in the middle of everything I wanna be

Eyes to the sky to find a sign
Some kind of navigation light
Shining in the night to learn the tide
Like rising from a shallow grave

And there's no way to get out
And there's no way to stay in
And I'm stuck in the middle of everything
Stuck in the middle of everything I wanna be

There's no way to get out
And there's no way to stay in
Lifeless and waiting on the shore
This ship was meant to sail away
Lifeless, waiting, patient, breathing
Let healing restore feeling
Lifeless, waiting, patient, breathing
Let healing restore feeling

Eyes to the sky to find a sign
Some kind of navigation light
Shining in the night to learn the tide
Like rising from a shallow grave

There's no way to get out
And there's no way to stay in
And I'm stuck in the middle of everything
Stuck in the middle of everything I wanna be
I wanna be
