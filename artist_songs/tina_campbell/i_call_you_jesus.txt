Mmm, what a name
Mmm, that name
Mmm, oh the name
Mmm, great name

Your name is peace, your name is joy, your name is wisdom, your name is Lord
Your name is love, mercy & grace, your name is redeemer, your name is to be praised

[Chorus:]
I call you Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. Your name is powerful, you're powerful [x2]

Your name is healer, of sickness & disease,
Your name is provider, of everything I need,
Your name is deliverer, you rescued me from harm,
Your name is Light of the World, Son of the living God

[Chorus]

Your name is Author, and finisher of my fate,
Your name is omnipotent, the name above all names,
Your name is the Word of God, the way, the truth, the life,
the awesome, the Almighty King, the only names that's right

[Chorus]

Mmm, what a name
Mmm, that name
Mmm, oh the name
Mmm, great name
[x2]

[Chorus x2]
