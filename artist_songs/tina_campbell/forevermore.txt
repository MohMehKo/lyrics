Your presence is what we long for just to feel your glory all around
Where there's fullness, fullness of joy and pleasure forevermore

Let heaven fill this place, as we rest in your embrace

We give you glory forevermore...
Halleujah, forevermore...

We stand in awe of you all mighty God, for you have given us your only son
Let all creation, shout your name, for all our sins you have washed away

Our creator, risen savior, Jesus Christ, sovereign Lord of all

We give you glory forevermore...
Halleujah, forevermore...

We stand in awe of you, almighty God, for you have given us your only son
Let all creation shout your name, for all our sins you have washed away 

Our creator, risen savior, Jesus Christ, sovereign Lord of all...

(Ohh, Jesus
We lift your name most high, we lift your name most high
Oooo, Jesus, halleujah)
We worship you, forevermore...
Forevermore...

We give you glory forevermore...
