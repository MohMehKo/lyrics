[Stevie Wonder:]
Every morning I wake up, you're the reason for my smile.
Before I close my eyes, it's you I'm thinking about.
Every part of you loves every part of me.
I never knew before that this is how it could be
Cause I'm so satisfied, I'm amazed, I'm overjoyed in every way.
It ain't nothing like what I'm feeling

Love, love, love...
