I will wait on you, oh oh, I will wait on you
No I wont be afraid, I'll hold on and I'll wait, I will wait

My circumstance is urgent, I'm in a real bad space, I'm trying to believe, but I'm struggling today,
Fear is all around me, and I don't know what to do, so here I am Jesus and I sure need you, and I...

I will wait on you, oh oh, I will wait on you
No I wont be afraid, I'll hold on and I'll wait, I will wait

Lord my life's a fire, and I have been burned, I've been trying to fix this, but it never works,
So I surrender, all of my care, I bring them all to you, and I'm leaving them here, and I...

I will wait on you, oh oh, I will wait on you
No I wont be afraid, I'll hold on and I'll wait

In your holy word, you said you would come, and give me the strength, to overcome, my life will be changed,
Forever more, and like an eagle, I believe I'll soar, and I will tell the world, that I waited for you,
Yes I did and you performed a miracle that no one else could do, so Lord I'm here and now...

I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait on you Lord...

No I wont... I wont be afraid, I'll hold on... and I'll wait, I will wait
