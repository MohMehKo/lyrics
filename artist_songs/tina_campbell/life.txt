From the Jesus was, came down from heaven to prove his love
He beat the devil, did it for me, Jesus spoke my freedom and my victory

He came to give me life, life abundantly, that's what I believe, 
that's what I receive, I believe it

I'll never doubt him cause He's there more than able, He never fails,
He is a good God and I am his child, He's gonna bless me right here and now, 

He came to give me life, life abundantly,
that's what I believe, that's what I receive, I believe it

He came to give me life
He came to give me life
He came to give me life
He came..
[repeat]

I got life abundantly
Life abundantly
[repeat]
