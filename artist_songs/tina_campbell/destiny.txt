I've got a destination in my veiw 
The road may be bumpy getting there
But I'm pressing through
I will enjoy this journey
No matter come what may
I'll become better and stronger
And wiser everyday

I've got a vision and a purpose
A divine destiny
It may not look like it right now
But faith ain't what I see
It is the things I hope for
believing that it will come
And no matter how long it takes
I know God's will shall be done

His will is that I prosper
His will is that I win
His will is that I fight on
His will is that I live
Ooooo He gave me what I needed
When He gave me his son 
He gave me hope and a future
He gave me the greatest love

And now that I've got Jesus
Helping me along the way
He's perfecting everything about this ole girl
Making me brand new in every way

So I'm singing Hallelujah
I'm not what I used to be
I'm following Jesus everyday
To reach my destiny

(I believe I'll sing it again)
Hallelujah
I'm not what I used to be
I'm following Jesus everyday
To reach my destiny

(I believe I'll sing it again)
Hallelujah
I'm not what I used to be
I'm following Jesus everyday
To reach my destiny
