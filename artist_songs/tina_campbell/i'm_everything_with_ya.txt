[Honey:]
I'm a victor not a victim, cause I serve the most high,
I fall but I get back up cause I'm made to survive,
I'm reaching for what's ahead, I won't look behind,
I gotta push and press my way, if I want to get the prize 
If I keep living life's going to happen and it ain't all gon' seem good
but as long as God is on the throne it'll work out for my good.
I've been chosen for his purpose so he orchestrates my life.
If I get in the way I'm gon' mess it up 
So I tell him day and night:

Lord, I'm nothing without ya but I'm everything with ya [x3]

[Tina:]
Can't live with Jesus part time but expect full benefits.
I did it that way and it don't work so I decided to commit,
I decided to reflect his light, I'm gonna tell the world he saves,
I'm talk about his love, his power don't care what people say
Cause if I keep living life's gonna happen and it ain't all gon' seem good
but as long as God is on the throne it'll work out for my good
I've been chosen his purpose so he orchestrates my life,
if I get in the way I'm gon' mess it up so I tell him day and night

Lord, I'm nothing without ya but I'm everything with ya [x3]

(If God is) If God is (With me) With me (I got everything) I got everything (That I need) That I need [x4]

(I got everything) I got everything 
(That I need) That I need [x8]
I got everything [x3], everything;
My Lord, everything;
Is everything, everything;
My my Jesus is, everything;
My my my Savior, everything;
My God, my God, everything;
He's my joy, everything;
He's my peace, everything;
He's my friend, everything;
Everyday, everything
[x4]

If God is, with me, I got everything, that I need
Cause if I keep living life's gonna happen and it ain't all gonna seem good
but as long as God is on the throne it'll work out for my good
I've been chosen for his purpose so he orchestrates my life
If I get in the way I'm gon' mess it up so I tell him day and night

Lord I'm nothing without ya but I'm everything with ya [x4]
