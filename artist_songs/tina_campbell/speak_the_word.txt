Word of God is power
Sharper than a sword
It knows the thoughts you're thinking
And what you're feeling in your heart
It'll teach you, train you, transform you if you let it in
It'll cover you and carry you, turn you away from sin
If you want to be like Jesus, and live like he lived
You gotta read the Bible and do what he did

Speak the word
If you're tired of being in the situation you're in
Speak the word
If you're sick in your body and you're ready to be healed
Speak the word
If the way you're thinking has really got to change
Speak the word
Cause the power of life and death isn't what you say
The word of God is your weapon
Use it to fight and win
Speak the word

Word of God is power
Sharper than a sword
It knows the thoughts you're thinking
And what you're feeling in your heart
It'll teach you, train you, transform you if you let it in
It'll cover you and carry you, turn you away from sin
If you want to be like Jesus, and live like he lived
You gotta read the Bible and do what he did

Speak the word
To remind yourself that God gave your authority
Speak the word
To renew you mind and keep the devil under your feet
Speak the word
To leave the past behind and be who God called you to be
Speak the word
Cause its alive and it revives everything
The word of God is the truth and the light
And it'll make you free
Speak the word

(Speak the word...)
Jesus loves you and he saves
When you're in Christ
You're never the same
Let him change your nature
Let him make it right
As you draw closer
He'll change your life your life
Don't settle for less you can have it all
Just get in that book and let Jesus talk
Let the word fill you, let the word heal you
Let the word save you, let the word change you
Cause Jesus died for you and me
Got up out the grave
With all authority
He gives you power when you invite him in
He'll be your help, your closest friend
Through Jesus Christ, you can do all things
You can live your life abundantly
He gives you hope and a future
He makes you more than a conquer
You been redeemed, you are brand new
His word has perfected everything about you
So stomp on the devil, crush him under your feet
You are an overcomer
You got the victory

You will not know unless you read
You will not have unless you speak
So speak it, believe it, receive it
Oh, speak...
