And I told you, you better move along, yeah
And I told you, what you thought was wrong
And I told you, the solitude inside, yeah
I will show you, we don't have to hide

This goes on and on, and on, and on
On and on again, yeah
Catch your breath and move along
On and on again

And I told you, keep your piece of mind, yeah
And I told you, the peace you hold inside
And I told you, everything you've known, yeah
They will know you for everything you've shown

This goes on and on, and on, and on
On and on again, yeah
Catch your breath and move along
On and on again

Don't hide from everyone
Come see what you've become
You've tried since you were young
To shine in front of everyone

And I told you, this is what you need, yeah
And I told you, what a life to lead
And I told you, controlling on your nerve, yeah
Now you own you, speaking your own words

This goes on and on, and on, and on
On and on again, yeah
Catch your breath and move along
On and on again

On and on, and on, and on
On and on again, yeah
Catch your breath and move along
On and on again
