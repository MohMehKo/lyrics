If I could take away the sun
And steal the light from everyone
Then you’d all be forced to see
What the world looks like to me

I believe
You will see
I believe monsters in me
I believe
You will see
I believe
Monsters in me

Sometimes it feels like number one
But Half the time i'm feeling numb
It hard to show you how i feel
When Everything is so sereal

[Repeat chorus]

The good inside completely drained
As I wake and scream your name
Distant voices sing in tune
Howling choir under moon

If I could take away the sun
And steal the light from everyone
Then you’d all be forced to see
What the world looks like to me

Take away the sun
Take away the sun
Take away the sun
Take away the sun
