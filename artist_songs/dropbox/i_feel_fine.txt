Rip apart my only means to unwind
Swim through the mud
I am a slave to the mind
Who ever would deny
Themselves to the world
Tell us a story
Of a sickness ignored

I feel fine 
Losing time

Where are the days where
Simple pleasures are made
I've tripped and found myself
Right into a grave
Let's weep together so
I wont feel alone
This better end 
So i can stand on my own

I feel fine
Loseing time
I'm alright
Lose my mind

You don't know
How much strength
And control
If i could tell between
The new and the old
My state of consciousness
Would widden to see
All of my sickness
Was caused by me

I feel fine 
Loseing time
I'm alright
Losing my mind

I feel fine
