Ride out her open road
Fell to the waste side
Dinned on her dirt soul
Ain't willing to pass it by
Went down by the loads
Told time by the moon and sun
Hide'n out in my abode
Said i'm the only one

I'm doin it cause i like it
Wishbone
Out of my way to find it
Wishbone

Smoke rings above the flames
Bitter sweat aftermath
Dry mouth i call her name
She leads an easy path
Dark eyes and dark intentions
She'll answer every question
Tied up to have her way
This one is just for play

I'm doin it cause i like it 
Whishbone
Out of my way to find it
Whishbone
Don't bother me while i'm on it
Whishbone
You fall apart without it

I wanna brake you apart
I wanna overflow you
