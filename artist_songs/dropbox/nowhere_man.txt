Apread your cards
Upon the table
Now's the time
To show your able

Nowhere man you will find
Yourself dead or older
Ask for me all the time
You've spent to make it over

Starve the mind
Of pain and hunger
Long to see them gaze
And wonder

Nowhere man you will
Find yourself dead or older
Ask for me all the time
You've spent to make it over
Nowhere man you might
Blind yourself getting sober
As for me come and cry to me
To wet my shoulder

Don't go down that road

Nowhere man you will
Find yourself dead or older
Ask for me all the time
You've spent to make it over
Nowhere man you you might
Blind yourself getting sober
As for me come and cry for me
And wet my shoulder
