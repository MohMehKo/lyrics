You can be the one to lie to me
And keep me up at night
And I’m the one who couldn’t see
To try to make things right

Spoken is the word, forgotten is his name
Do you speak the truth or are you to blame
Inside I fee so cold and nothing feels right
I’ve watched it all unfold it feels like I’ve died

I wouldn’t see you run to me
If I needed you to come
I know your love wasn’t free
So I’m sitting here undone

Spoken is the word, forgotten is his name
So you speak the truth or are you to blame
Inside I feel so cold and nothing feels right
I’ve watched it all unfold it feels like I’ve died

But I felt that if I could close my eyes
That all the dead would come alive
I went and bet it all until I went insane
I’m ending all of this I threw that part away

Spoken is the word, forgotten is his name
Do you speak the truth or are you to blame
I feel so cold nothing feels right
It all unfolds feels like I’ve died
