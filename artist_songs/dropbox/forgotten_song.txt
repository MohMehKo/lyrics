For as long as I knew about the things they say
I’ve wondered how long they’ve been that way
They don’t even know just what they need for
Themselves
I felt I knew at the age of twelve

Nobody knows my pain
And no one sings in the rain
Nobody’s hummin forgotten song
And no one really belongs

They say a real man can show how he feels
But when I try I just keep spinning my wheels
Something tells me I could be wrong
Let’s sing together to the forgotten song

Nobody knows my pain
And no one sings in the rain
Nobody’s hummin forgotten song
And no one really belongs

As I walk along I slip
And wonder where I went a stray
But I’m gonna find my way
While we sing forgotten songs
Remembering where we went wrong
But we’re gonna find our way

Nobody knows my pain
And no one sings in the rain
Nobody’s hummin forgotten song
And no one really belongs
Nobody knows my pain
And no one sings in the rain
Nobody’s hummin forgotten song
And no one really belongs
