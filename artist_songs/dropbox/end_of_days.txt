Far behind your eyes 
I see your rage
That holds you down 
There's no better time
To burn the sage
To turn around

All's far in love and war 
But all i see are black's and grey's
My life will measure yours 
See you at the end of days

Underneath your lies
I feel betrayed it's gettin old
Never been locked down by your chains
They're so cold
Fighting all the pressure you receive
Then you leave

All's far in love and war
But all i see are black's and grey's
My life will measure yours
See you at the end of days
All's far in love and war 
But all i see are black's and grey's
Needing and wanting more
See you at the end of days

You're troubled and fear moving on
Surroundings are burnt up and gone
You can't even trust your own ways
The darker it gets through this haze
Will prove to be your end of days
