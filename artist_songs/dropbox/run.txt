Well on my way
I smell the rain
Rumblins of a storm
The cowards will run
The warchild will fight
They’ll bring the world to its knees

How will I know
Where will we go from here
I’ll tell you it’s not what you dream about at
Night alone
And I run

Tending the wounds
I’m living the truth
The strength of a knew found world
And through it all the last man tall
Will have bled for a word called free

How will I know
Where will we go from here
I’ll tell you it’s not what you dream about at
Night alone

And I run
And I run
And I run
And I run

How will I know
Where will we go from here
I’ll tell you it’s not what you dream about at
Night alone
