We live alone to die alone
To live in sorrow and be ashamed
And when it's time it's just begun
You look around to lay your blame
And when tomorrow passes you by
Don't come runnin back to me cause
I've grown since I've last seen you
and I'm not who I used to be

But nobody cares (nobody cares) nobody cares (nobody cares)
nobody cares (nobody cares) nobody cares (nobody cares)

And once again
I've been sucked in to the game
I stay a slave
I try to place this bitter taste
But all my efforts end in rage
And if I told you that I hate you
Would things still be the same
Still I didn't mean to break you
But I need someone to blame

And nobody cares (nobody cares) nobody cares (nobody cares)
Nobody cares (nobody cares) nobody cares (nobody cares)
nobody cares (nobody cares) nobody cares (nobody cares)
nobody cares (nobody cares) nobody cares...
