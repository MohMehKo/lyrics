You fall apart and fall away
I know It’s hard but you’ll always be the blame
I’ll take the part that you can’t take away

You are hollow, the one with no soul
Can I borrow, a little self control
It’s hard to swallow, it’s hard to fill this whole
And I won’t follow, so I will let you go

I fall away when I can’t take the pain
I fall away and find a better place

Resurrect me and help me find my way
Disconnecting and look into another day
Feel so empty and you are out of reach
So preach to me a sermon you can’t teach

I fall away when I can’t take the pain
I fall away when nothing feels the same
I fall away and find a better place

The blinding sun told me I’m the one
And I knew that this would get me through
So you can stay and watch me fall away

I fall away when I can’t take the pain
I fall away when nothing feels the same
I fall away and find a better place
I fall away when I can’t take the pain
So you can stay and watch me fall away
