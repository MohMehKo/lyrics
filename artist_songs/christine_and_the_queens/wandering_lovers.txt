Let the sun pour on your skin
Let it shine
I won't take no other order

Tonight I stood up for you
In the crowd
Life has never felt so widened

It's true when they say
We are not fitted for each other

But here's the appeal
I've never wanted someone more

One
Are the water and the rock
Are the litter and the chalk
My love made them move made
Them melt

One
With my fingers I will draw
The road where we need to go
My love made them move, made
Them melt

Let the rain wind on you face
Let it steep
This is such a sweet surrender

Tell them that we way be gone
For a while
We're about to drop the anchor

You're a wake up call
What is tremendous
Is divine

If they don't want you
They'll turn us into
Wandering lovers

One
Are the water and the rock
Are the litter and the chalk
My love made them move made
Them melt

One
With my fingers I will draw
The road where we need to go
My love made them move, made
Them melt
