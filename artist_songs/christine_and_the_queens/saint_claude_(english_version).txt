So softly speaking
Your words' a constant babbling stream
Come from nowhere, where, where
Come from nowhere, where, where

You eyelids paint in chalk
Shimmering haze just as you talk
Are you sinking, king, king
Are you sinking, king, king

I see that your left arm is ink stained
And since you're sleeveless
Your winged lion gives a sly wink
Does he know my loneliness?

And then I steal a glimpse of your face 
As you turn the other way
Now I'll play your ghost as my ace
Whenever I'm led astray

Here's my station
Here's my station
But if you say just one word I'll stay with you
[x2]

Such an attitude 
Impatient, gloriously rude 
Are you for real, real, real
You're not for real, real, real

Every breath you take
Is a violent strain that breaks
Through their cursing, sing, sing
Through their cursing, sing, sing

Before you, I had nothing
But a handful of sad scents
And this town is dead my darling
You're the one that reinvents

With my lips sealed I say a prayer
"Long live the fool, kill the king"
I am offered newborn anger
And the storm will hear us sing

Here's my station
Here's my station
But if you say just one word I'll stay with you
[x2]

Pour que l'orage s'annonce...
