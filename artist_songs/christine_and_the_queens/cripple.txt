I miss my Motus to tell me how
I miss Mathusalem to tell me why
I miss them for being white and red
I miss them for all the tears they shed

Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple
Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple
Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple
Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple

I miss prothesis and mended souls
How they trample on beauty with those singin’ thoughts
I’m in for shady insomnia
When they said “je suis plus folle que toi!”

Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple
Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple
Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple
Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple

They love and let down
They love and let down
They love and let down
They love and let down

Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple
Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple
Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple
Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple
