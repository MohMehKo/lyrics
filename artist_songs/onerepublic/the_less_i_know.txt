All my life I've been waiting for something
Realized I've been waiting so long I think it's you
But you confuse me
You tell me up I'll be walking down the stairs
You tell me down I'll be climbing up
I think it's crazy and it tortures me
Oh call me late, call me liar, call me anything, oh just call me

Babe won't you tell me where you got engrossed?
I said babe do you want to take it fast or slow?
I swear the more I get to know you the less I know

All the weight that we've thrown on each other
All the way just to figure out I don't mind you
And you don't mind me
Yeah
All the lies, all the dancing around and
And all the times I came home so late
You know that oh cause you know me
Call me late, call me crazy, call me anything, but just call me

Babe won't you tell me where you got engrossed?
I said babe do you want to take it fast or slow?
I swear the more I get to know you the less I know

[Instrumental Break]

Babe won't you tell me where you got engrossed?
I said babe do you want to take it fast or slow?
I swear the more I get to know you the less I...
The less I know
The less I know
The less I know
The less I know
I swear the more I get to know you the less I know
