Mother said don't pack your bags
We ain't got no time for that
They shut the lights off in our neighborhood
Don't know if we're coming back

I saw signs on the video
I saw signs looking back but you never know
Sunrise on the radio
Said the sharp bulbs long lines
The false signs come in stereo
Tip of my scale is like a wave and I figured on
Don't know if I can let it go
I ain't got more time
So don't look down don't close your eyes

Fly closer to heaven and far from hell
Fly put your wings up so put your wings up
Fly far from the city we knew so well
Fly so put your wings up put your wings up
Time we say goodbye to the neighborhood

Mother said don't pack your bags
We ain't got no time for that
We'll switch our names up in our neighborhood
We'll make sure we don't attract

I saw signs on the video
I saw signs looking back but you never know
A sunrise on the radio
Said the sharp bulbs long lines
The false signs come in stereo
Tip of my scale is like a wave and I figured on
Don't know if I can let it go
I ain't got more time
So don't look down don't close your eyes

Fly closer to heaven and far from hell
Fly put your wings up so put your wings up
Fly far from the city we knew so well
Fly so put your wings up put your wings up
Time we say goodbye to the neighborhood

Do you hear us do you see my face I want the world to know
What are we now for the love like animals just to find a home
Searching the horizon for a sign
All I see is dark but I sail on
I can hear my heart beat harder
I'm still here but not much farther
Now we sit now we walk
Now they turn us back down
I don't speak I don't stop
I just keep on moving

Fly closer to heaven and far from hell
Fly put your wings up so put your wings up
Fly far from the city we know so well
Fly so put your wings up so put your wings up
Time we say goodbye
