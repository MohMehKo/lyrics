When I was younger
You told me I should get my shit together
You said life is a painting
But all your colors always bleed together
Woo all the times you said I wasn't just quite right
Woo and all I was trying to do was search for a light

When you said look for your sunshine it's not there
I told myself that I don't care
I found some new innovations
Might just be my imagination
But people can dream

When I was younger
You told me I should get my shit together
Because life is a painting
But you ain't trying to show me you ain't clever
Woo for all the times you said I wasn't just quite right

But you said look for your sunshine it's not there
I told myself that I don't care
I found some new innovations
Might just be my imagination
People can dream (People can dream, people can dream, people can dream)
Yeah

In my dark days and night
It might've been just a dream
In these dark days and night
I'll be more than what you see
In my dark there's a light
It might've been just a dream
In these dark days and night (Dark days and night)

Oh when I was younger
You told me I should get my shit together (People can dream)
When I was younger
So why your colors always bleed together

People can dream 
People can dream
People can dream
