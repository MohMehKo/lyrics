I'll be a fool when the suns out
Burn you a fire when you burn out
And give you the future you gave away
And give you my youth for some million days

I'll do all these things for you
Take what's broken make it new
â€¨Yesterdays gone yeah it went away
I've been lost but I'm here today
I'll do all these things for you

I'll be the drug that you can't buy
I'll tell you the truth when it's all lies hey
I'll give you the future you gave away
I'll give you my youth for some million days

I'll do all these things for you
Take what's broken make it new
Yesterdays gone yeah it went away
I've been lost but I'm here today
I'll do all these things for you

Something to trust for the first time oh
Making it up for the last nights
Sucks to love when you just lie oh
A couple of years and I'll have your soul and I

I'll do all these things for you hey
Take what's broken and make it new
Yesterdays gone yeah it went away
I've been lost but I'm here today
I'll do all these things for you
I'll do all these things for you
I'll do all these things for you
