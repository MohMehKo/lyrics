I think it's time that I told you
I'm a fan of your universe
And every shade that you offer
It's different but I know it works
I'm addicted to the magic
And the glow of the city lights
I felt it in my veins just didn't know how to say it right

She said do you see me in black and white
Do you need me every day and night
I said I don't wanna dance with another
We could feel this darkness with each other

Cause when I look at you I see colors
When I look at you I see colors

Everyone's got their own light
Some shine and they fade away
Everyone's got a story
Those change every single day

She said do you see me in shades of grey
Do you need me like I need you that way
I say I don't wanna lay with another
We could feel this quiet with each other

Cause when I look at you I see colors
When I look at you I see colors
I see woo colors
I see woo colors

Every time I look at you lately
I see colors they're changing
Every time I look at you lately
I see colors
I see you in black and white
I see you in the brightest light

Yeah when I look at you colors
When I look at you I see colors
When I look at you I see woo colors
I see woo colors
