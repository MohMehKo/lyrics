I was born, born to love you
I was born, born to love you
Bust through the door said what's your name
Looking for somebody and you match the shame
Now don't lie
Don't lie

You've seen me television and you know what's up
The worlds gone crazy and you're mighty stuck
So don't lie
So don't lie
I said here that's where I'll be living until my times up
Yeah found someone to keep my head up
Yeah trading darkness for the dawn
I was born, born to love you
I was born, born to love you

Lost in stars since she was a girl
She dreamt of a place of a better world
It felt like sunlight
Tired of the days living in the dark
She ran to the place where wild things are
It felt right
Cause it felt right
She said here is where I'll be living until my times up yeah
Found my people now I'm made up
Always dark before the dawn
Always dark before the dawn
I was born, born to love you
I was born, born to love you

I said here is where I'll be living until my times up
I said here I found my people now I'm made up yeah
I was born, I was born in the city born and raised
I was born, I was born in the city all my friends are here
I was born in the city born and raised
I was born in the city all my friends are here
I was born inside
No woo I woo I...
