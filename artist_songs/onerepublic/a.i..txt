[Ryan Tedder:]
'Member when we met?
We fell in love on a Sunday
Yeah I'll never forget
The way that you spelled my name
It took me a year
To find a new attraction
My hope and my fear
Is human interaction

Yeah I just want my love automatic
If artificial love makes sense
I just want your love, I'm an addict
Artificial intelligence

Artificial
Artificial

[Peter Gabriel:]
Remember when we met?
I got obsessed on a Monday
And I'll never forget
I felt such a cliche
I'm wanting to be there
Dreaming of your soft skin
With no emotion
You can really make my head spin

[Ryan Tedder & Peter Gabriel:]
Yeah I just want my love automatic
If artificial love makes sense
I just want your love, I'm an addict
Artificial intelligence
Yeah I just want my love automatic
If artificial love makes sense
I just want your love, I'm an addict
Artificial intelligence

[Ryan Tedder:]
Artificial
Artificial

I just want my love automatic
If artificial love makes sense
I just want your love, I'm an addict
Artificial intelligence

[Peter Gabriel:]
You're so too real
Love the way you love me
Artificial intelligence
Way you love me
Love the way you love me
It's so clear
You make everything inside me feel
Just automatic hurt
Bring me back tonight
Cause you're intelligent, so real
So real
