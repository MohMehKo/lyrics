[Hook: Spose]
I'm in the place, y'all, trippin on things
I just walked in spillin my drink,
I play ball but I never scored a basket
You already know, you ain’t gotta ask it
Swagless, you know I’m (swagless)

[Verse 1: Spose]
Ugly, clumsy, trust me
Sandusky wouldn’t fuck me
You know who’s swagless
To get my shit together I would have to eat magnets
(Swagless)
So if you’re lookin call it off
I’m right here homie, swag holocaust
Eh, I’m fever than Justin Bieber
I tried to do the dougie, it was lookin like a seizure
I’m accidentally celibate, I could sign and drive a boxy Honda SUV and not be in my element
I been irrelevant, I’m still delicate, but this year I can bench 85 like Bill Belichick
Check it out, droolin out my mouth, fallin on a couch
I just dropped a coffee sloppy
And I’m retarded and I only wrote 14 bars

[Verse 2: Stiky-1]
I met this girl named Betty
She was all about it
We started dancing, shook her booty all around it
I felt so guilty, had to call my man and tell him
I hung up and lit a candle, put on Lady Antebellum
When I in the bar I order cran and peach drink, peach drink, burn, cruisin, sleepin in the backseat
I’m so real that I freak if I see a spider
I won’t walk into a dark room without a lighter
Give me the mic and I made it my two-thug shit I chipped it
I'mma be out at a restaurant counting the bill but you know I won't pitch in
Glitchin, nonfiction books be my addiction
Picturin my nana on the couch knittin me mittens
Broke and lazy, makin me babies
Collecting food stamps to save for a mercedes
Man I’m swagless, but I smell good
Spray painting Nautical stars [?] all over the neighborhood
