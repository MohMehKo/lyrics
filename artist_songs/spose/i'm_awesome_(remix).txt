[Intro: Spose]
Whoops, I just made another wal-mart anthem (anthem, anthem...)
Still the opposite of tall, dark, handsome
I got junk like a thumbtack
Abs like a one pack
Couldn't run one lap
Hoes, my hobbies include knitting
Mittens, but that's only when I'm not snitching
These other MC's feel bad because
I just discovered that my brother is my real dad
The zaniest freak who rocks rhymes
Because I, simultaneously sip box wine
And I'm, nothing but a top notch slob
Mooching off my baby's mother and a drop top Saab
I'm awesome (awesome, awesome, awesome....)
(the-the sw-swa-swa-swa-swagger of a cripple)
Remix...
This is a remix

[Hook: Spose]
Brotherfucker, I'm awesome
No you're not dude, don't lie
I'm awesome
I'm driving 'round in my mom's ride
I'm awesome
A quarter of my life gone by
And I met all your mothers online
Motherfucker, I'm awesome
I will run away from a brawl
I'm awesome
There's no voicemail, nobody called
I'm awesome
Now I got Kansas City involved

[Verse 1: Mac Lethal]
(Oh yeah, uh, check it out yo)
I'm awesome
Sitting home alone full of toxins
30 years old, looking like Macaulay Culkin
I use drugs just to hang with crazy actresses
But this ain't even cocaine
It's fucking baby laxative
Protest in public
Squirting out my dick putty
My goddamn girlfriend looks like KiD CuDi
Buddy, I'mma tear them apart
My friends are trendy assholes wearing arabic scarves
(Oh you fancy, huh?)
Nope, I'm just awesome
Beginner level, Street Fighter 4, using Dahlsim
I make more money selling oxy than I could performin'
I'm masturbating while I'm reading through the book of Mormon
At my grandmother's funeral drunk
But it won't start until
I get her body out of the trunk
My name is Mac Lethal, my style is explosive
Here, have a blunt
My little sister rolled it

[Hook: Mac Lethal]
She's awesome
We make it rain, and we give it
I'm awesome
Done with your girl in 3 minutes
I'm awesome
Laying on the couch takes work
I'd beat Nikki Minaj at weed Tennis
Motherfucker, I'm awesome
Never run away from the cops
I'm awesome
Every single day smoking crops
I'm awesome
North Korea, you're fucking up
I'm snacking on a push-up pop
Motherfucker I'm awesome (awesome, awesome, awesome...)

[Verse 2: Spose]
(How you living Spizzy Spose?)
Oh where should I begin?
Nissan whip, four cylinder engine (vroom vroom)
All my clothes got Jnco emblems and
Ah-he-heh-hem, all my friends are pretend (lame)
Juggalos, I blend in with them
Sip wine coolers, watching Nickelodeon
Look, I'm no Don Juan with the blonde babes
Because my belly's getting bulbous, my chest is concave
Chicks in Maine get migraines when my song plays
French chicks tell me "No parle Anglais" (excuse me)
I'm at your kid's first birthday
Gin bombay, interrupting that shit
Like I'm Kanye (Yo I'mma let you finish)
I'm in a house full of cats (rawr)
McDonald's snack wraps in the trash out back
I'm awesome, I'm getting shunned by the bloggers
While I'm sitting in a kiddie pool reading Harry Potter
I'm not lying, dude
Ask my neighbors
Taco Bell what I bought with the paper
And I don't even start shit with the haters
I weigh about the same as a fat third grader (sup girl)
And 2010's been strange, wierd
Unemployed, signed in the same year
My pajama pants got reindeer
While I'm up at Applebee's drinking sangria

[Hook: Spose]
I'm awesome
My stomach hurts because I can't burp
I'm awesome
Fred Durst just wrote my last verse
I'm awesome
I'm puking up yogurt because
I think I look fat in this shirt
Motherfucker, I'm awesome
Whip exterior wood grain
I'm awesome
I just watched a softball game
I'm awesome
I'm the least famous person with fame
On stage with my clothes all stained
Motherfucker I'm awesome
