We hate money 
Broke people stand up, if you lack cash put a hand up 
We hate money 
And all the people getting paid, throw all your money on stage 
We hate money 
Dollars, cash, cheese, unless you're gonna give some to me 
We hate money 
And everyone who has it, we would do things that you couldn't imagine 

If I ever had money, I would do some crazy shit
I'd probably hire Lady Gaga to babysit 
So give me money, and I'll be like "Fuck it" 
I'll drop a hundred grand to make a vegan man eat turducken 
You know I wouldn't hold off, I would spend my figures 
Get a nose job, make it even bigger 
Set my Nissan on fire on the lawn 
Then I buy my own plane, step on and yell "Bomb!" 
And as my ego and my pockets swell 
I'd fly to the next town to go to Taco Bell 
Then I'd pay all the haters to become believers 
I'd pay Kanye West to punch Justin Bieber 
And then I'd buy a bunch of heroin and get really arrogant 
And pay all the foreigners to become Americans 
The possibilities are endless 
I would even go to the dentist, but 

We hate money 
Broke people stand up, if you lack cash put a hand up 
We hate money 
And all the people getting paid, throw all your money on stage 
We hate money 
Dollars, cash, cheese, unless you're gonna give some to me 
We hate money 
And everyone who has it, we would do things that you couldn't imagine 

We got trash on the porch, we never owned a Porsche 
We only wear our neckties to weddings and to court 
Our pay gets docked like it's coming into port 
So we keep cigars split up like they're getting a divorce 
Employees all annoyed, checks all void 
Eminem's the only one still employed in Detroit 
Bobzins and jobs from Nevada to Dakotas 
And we're not Japanese but we're broke as Toyotas 
Broseph, I know you know this fired and demoted 
They're drinking tapwater 'cuz they can't afford sodas 
Struggling, covering shifts just to buy Christmas gifts 
Before Tiger had mistresses 
We're at Wal-Mart, we hate Wall Street
As far as being in debt, we're balls deep 
Collectors call me, fucking all week 
But I send that shit straight to voicemail 

We hate money 
Broke people stand up, if you lack cash put a hand up 
We hate money 
And all the people getting paid, throw all your money on stage 
We hate money 
Dollars, cash, cheese, unless you're gonna give some to me 
We hate money 
And everyone who has it, we would do things that you couldn't imagine 

They told us "Go to college, expand our domes" 
Now we're jobless, with sixty thousand dollars in loans 
And the bank account's minus, surviving debt 
While the CEOs fly by in private jets 
So let me see your lighters, the funds couldn't be tighter 
And you call orderves appetizers 
If your whole predicament's vile, but you're still trying to smile 
With the bills piled for miles 
Problems, we've got ninety-eight plus one, no trust funds 
If the cops come we must run 
I do it for my belt buckle, black lung, 
White knuckle, blue collar 
Cold-hearted slaves to the dollar saying 

We hate money 
Broke people stand up, if you lack cash put a hand up 
We hate money 
And all the people getting paid, throw all your money on stage 
We hate money 
Dollars, cash, cheese, unless you're gonna give some to me 
We hate money 
And everyone who has it, we would do things that you couldn't imagine 

We hate money 
Broke people stand up, if you lack cash keep your hands up 
We hate money 
And all the people getting paid, you can all go away 
We hate money 
(and) dollars (and) cash (and) cheese (and) unless you're gonna give some to me 
We hate money 
And everyone who has it, we would do things that you couldn't imagine
