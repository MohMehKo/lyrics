Look, I don't have a mansion
I've never been to the Hamptons
It's more likely you'd find me if you came up here and went camping
I got bills stacked like Jenga
Respected less then most singers
But you don't see me sulk about or wallow in self doubt and let that linger 
Look, I still haven't been killed
I got pills every time I got ill
I don't got mils to top cough drops
Or a house in the hills
But I won't feel sorry for myself 
I don't need anything opulent as long as I got oxygen
(Ya Mean)

[Chorus]
Tonight if you see me knockin on wood
That's just cause I'm doin so fucking good
I don't hate my life, No its goin alright 
That's why tonight you see me knocking on wood 

I got all my limbs 
I don't got cancer, I'm superb
I never got kidnapped on my way to work
Got free education, Bitch I'm learnt!
But some people aren't so lucky
Knock on wood

I don't got HD Tv, But I got insulation
I got no Lamborghinis, But I got vaccinations
I got a microwave, I got some pocket change
But even if I didn't, No complaints

[Chorus]

Peter Sparker back up in this bitch is on
Say free country, I can say what the fuck I want 
Shit!
Bitch!
Cunt!
Fuck the government!
Buy my songs!
Some places you say Shit like this and you get your hands cut off

Lucky aren't we?
All this time to get drunk and party, puke up food while kids are starving
All of Somalia not one arbys
Were popin water bottles,What!
Were gettin tattooed,What!
Were gettin fat, takin naps, eatin mad food

[Chorus]

Look, I don't have a mansion
I've never been to the Hamptons
It's more likely you'd find me if you came up here and went camping
I got bills stacked like Jenga
Respected less then most singers
But you don't see me sulk about or wallow in self doubt and let that linger 
Look, I still haven't been killed
I got pills every time I got ill
I don't get mils to top cough drops 
Or a house in the hills
But I won't feel sorry for my self
I don't need anything opulent as long as I got oxygen
(Sing it!)

[Chorus x2]
