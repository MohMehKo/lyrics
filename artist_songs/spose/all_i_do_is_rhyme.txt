[Intro:]
(right now)
C'est la vie up in here
Je suis l'illest
(right now)
Nous avon foum√© tout le weed

[Chorus:]
All I do is rhyme, and smoke my weed
And spend my time
Trying to get better than me
And I'd be fine
If I never made it, but I did
So I take credit cause I changed my life
No I'm doing alright

[Verse 1: Spose]
Look, I know you had a party and I'm sorry that I missed it
But these days I run a twenty four hour, seven day a week business
I won't even have a day off on christmas
Just to make sure I got some milk on my crispix
And I couldn't put it simpler
If you don't get it, forget it man, we must be dissimilar
I've been touring foreign places out of the perimeter
Just to get the bank account to mount another integer (Minnesota!)
Nobody told me it would not be tough
Backwoods with me and the broccolis stuffed
I got my calon on ice like a hockey puck
I'll keep making it 'til haters are like "stop, enough!"
Try to copy us, they're see through
I see it clear, tell the engineer, keep the beat looped
And look at hard times that I elude
No days off like i sold chinese food

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Cam Groves]
Cause life is short homie
And I don't have the time to lose
And I was out rhyming dude
While you were buying shoes
And it's true
Who would ever want to rue in time
With do I do with mine
All I do is rhyme
And I'm doing fine
You gotta take that chance
And stay grinding harder than jamaicans dance
I'm on stage playing for a lake of fans
While you're at home naked with your snake in hand
Crammed in the studio, I keep the beat crank
Yo you smell that weed stank?
Yo it must be pdank
Oh you like my music, girl? gee thanks
Go buy my cd kids cause i need bank
And I've always loved rap
And I've had a knack for it
Since back before I could slap a backboard
Ten years later let life fast forward
Now I'm making those tracks that the people ask for

[Chorus]
