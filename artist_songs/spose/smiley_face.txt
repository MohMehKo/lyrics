Yo, this is a fat white kid
Crip walking through a Walmart, eating a Twix
This is, his mom in the next aisle, neglecting him while sending a text
This is, a mirror to society
I've already seen the truth so you don't got to lie to me
This is the skull behind a smiley face
The dark side that we all try to hide away

Join me as we open on a heavy set bride
As she cries on her wedding dress
Cheeks getting wet cause there's something she would never guess
Better yet
Zoom in on the bridesmaid
She fucked the groom five ways in the bride's driveway (no way)
Fast-forward to the bride's suicide
I know a lot of sad adjectives, and all of them apply
It's fucked up, because she suffered then she dies
But for this woman it was just tougher to be alive
If you rewind,
You'll see that there were other issues
In her bedroom clutching on a chunk of tissues
At nine, got touched by her uncle Mitchel
It's a cold world, darker than some pumpernickel

And I'm not trying to bum you out or make you sad
I just think somebody ought to state the facts
It's cool, they don't even hear half the raps
Working on their swag

Let me tell you buddy,
This is a fat white kid
Crip walking through a Walmart, eating a Twix
This is, his mom in the next aisle, neglecting him while sending a text
This is, a mirror to society
I've already seen the truth so you don't got to lie to me
This is the skull behind a smiley face
The dark side that we all try to hide away

The next scene opens in a parking lot
Outside an old motel
With the neon glowing as the raindrops fell
Both from the sky and the eyes
Of the passengers
Inside a ride that arrived
The inhabitants
A mother and her 3 kids running
From a new husband who seemed to scream more than love 'em
Tonight, he said he'd burn the house down
Kicked in the cupboard
They slipped out the back, undiscovered
She said they'd get a hotel room and a pizza
Watch TV, and take a breather
She went into lobby and returned sick
She'd left her purse at the crib
Hair matted to her face as the rain poured
Her kids huddled with her slithered to the back door
And I'm not kidding he was sitting in the kitchen, waiting to start hitting

This is, what she won't say when you ask "how's it going" the very next day
And this is, her kids doing well in school even though at home life was hell
This is, a mirror to society
I've already seen the truth, you don't got the lie to me
This is, the skull behind a smiley face
The dark side that we all try to hide away
