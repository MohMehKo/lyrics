[Verse 1:]
I started out underground, I was kinda like a seed
I had no manager, booked my own shows
Made the posters, and afterwards I sold CD's
Then I made a song making fun of all the bragging
And it brew up in like, not long
Then I got signed to a deal, threw me out to L.A.,
Put me in the studio and told me

[Chorus:]
We want you to write a Pop Song
We want you to write a Pop Song
And make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
And do it for the kids!

[Verse 2:]
Cause the kids want hits
They don't give a shit about the rhymes you spit
They just want a nice beat that they
All could rhyme to, with a chorus catchier
Than swine flu times two!
I know you like premo beats
So you compose verses like they we're a
Key note speech but...
We just want you to be 3oh3!
Mixed with Flo-Rida mixed with B.o.B
Capiche? So make another Airplanes
Or a song like Billionaire
Either's fair game
Do it or go down in flames
Back to Maine you can beg mousse
For spare change
You can't sing! We'll auto tune it!
Make it sound like someone else's music
We brought writers who could make it sound tighter
We could pull it all night baby

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
No, I wanna do it for hip hop
You know fresh to death like a bird in a zip lock
There like Spose, you're not fucking Rick Ross
We want something more like Ke$ha, Tik Tok!
I wrote a verse, and said listen to this shit
They put their hands to their foreheads as I kicked it
They're like, look, I don't think that you get it
Nobody cares about your verse
It's not 96 kid!
I told them, look man, I'd rather had my wrist slit
Than sound like every other fucking singer in the business
They're like, really SPOSE, you'd be that cataclysmic
To make a couple songs for top 40 and rhytmic
With hooks big enough to catch Moby Dick with
And very few words with some melodies addictive
If you're not up to the task, grab your bags
Call a cab, its too bad because

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
We want you to write a Pop So...ng
We want you to write a Pop So...ng
And do it for the kids!
