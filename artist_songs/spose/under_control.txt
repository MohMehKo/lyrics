[Verse 1: Spose]
You know me
I get down I live now cause it's the S-P-O-S-E, S-E
You know we, we get down we live now and when we do we rep the Wells, M-E, M-E
Papa don't preach, momma I'm so sorry
I dont get paid till the end of next week
Laugh but it's not funny being broke
It makes you wanna grab a ski mask and not for bunny slopes
Nope
I'm done being a crook and thank heavens
I'm filing chapter 11 haven't started the book
Man look I earn it, I cash it, I burn it, I pack it again
I write it, I spit it, I make it for me and my friends

[Hook]
You know we, we get down we live now cause we're free to do what we want and rep the M-E
With Spose no lies. flows and bowls
But we gotta keep em under control
[x2]

[Verse 2: Spose]
And though I'm a proponent of boning and smoking chronic I propose doing both with discretion I've learned lessons
It's unimpressive but my checks bounce like asses blunt ashes all over the sofa and he mattress
If going ape is reverse evolution
And balls to the wall sounds sexually abusive
Me? I got a hankering for both
I can't seem to keep my anchor in the cove
On the low, my pops said that my money need management
More canned store-brand Spam, bologna sandwhiches
Somebody said go big or go home
I lost my house key what now holmes?
It's not a dinner in the summer or the winter when we clam bake
Ignore laws and mandates
Ignite fires in sand dunes
Me and lampoons
Whip opposite of Lambo freestyle with Cam Groves
