It was a regular day in junior high for Chris
Same "Hey faggot!" same "Watch out bitch!"
Same older kids who treated him like shit
just because he liked computers and talked with a lisp (Hey Chrisss!)
They embarrassed him in all ways, Lunch room, Gym class, Bathroom, Hallways, All day
Sometimes it made him wanna die

The fullest of the bullies was this one guy named Jimmy!
A trouble makin' popular kid, who humiliated Chris every chance he could get
And this year Chris skipped ahead two years in math
To ones delight and ones fright, they're in the same class
Chris went to piss with the bathroom pass, Jimmy took his inhaler out of his bookbag
Later in gym he had an asthma attack, when he saw him in the ambulance Jimmy just laughed
It escalated like stairs that move, until Jimmy decieded he was too cool for school
Years later he was doin' coke off the floor again, when Chris graduated as the Valedictorian

He was yawnin' as he came around the corner
mumbled talkin', lookin' like a speed walker sorta
Bags under his eyes, days since he slept
Sweat on his brow made his face all wet
His wild eyes fixed on CVS
As he pulled his bandanna up off of his neck
Adjusted something in his over sized shortst, fiddled with it as he walked up to the door of the store

It was Jimmy!

Came here to rob this shit, he had done it a few times and safely split
His arm swung pale, you could see his arteries, vile as he's walkin' down the aisle toward the pharmacist
He surveyed the scene, only one dude in line as far as he could see 
So, He grabbed that pistol by the handle part of it
And demanded oxycontin as he pointed at the pharmacist
Who quickly obliged, handed over evey pill they had on the other side 
Pocket full of oxys as he went to bail, but the next thing he remembered was wakin up in jail 
(The fuck just happened?)

Our homie Chris had a flight that night to Japan
After one interview they said he was their man
He'd be rich within the year, so say "konichiwa" to the head systems engineer
But he's still an asthmatic, so hes at the pharmacy stocking up for his travels
Waitin' in line, he's the only one, and then he sees some dude with a gun

Its fuckin' Jimmy!

That same bully from school, who called him a fag and kicked him in the jewels, what a fool
Retribution will be great, cause Chris was in shape, drinkin' protein shakes
Even in the gym through college, while Jimmy graduated under oxycotin
So when Jimmy turned around and started walkin'
Chris took a decisive step towards him there was nothing that could stop him
He scissor-kicked him in the side of the noggin
On some MMA shit, he instantly dropped him
Minutes later the in came the cops, and Chris smirked as the clerk got the blood all mopped
