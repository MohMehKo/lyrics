Yeah Spose

Everytime Spose and a beat colesce it is no less than sick nasty grotesque
Disgusting rhyme-busting twenty-something
Dude who gets booty like a pirate chest
So gobble a dank if you don't like him
Cause lyrically he rape a beat like a viking
Flow so honed, hot as your blood
Cool as snow cones, what it's all good
Quite suburban he's not at all hood
Not country just the woods so fuck Keith Urban
I've wrapped tight and over your head
Like a turban since you nerds left turds in the bed
I'm absurd with words emerged in burned threads
[x2]

We need more beats

Like a phoenix from the art of emceeing left dead
My friends jock dreads and play death metal
In Maine where they mount fox heads from the meadow on the wall
I'm off the wall, Michael Jackson
Maxing at Federal Jacks with something attractive
I'm a cactus with this rap shit (Spose)
Never resort to wack tactics (no)
Jaw-dropped reactions when I'm rapping (so)
Fly it's making me high like Toni Braxton
Mr. Spizzy is now teaching classes
So throw away all your busy-work packets
Decidedly un-ghetto rhyme fello
Who listens to Sublime from time-to-time
Hello it's Spizzle
They're miserable I exist
They're pissed but this rhyming mindless drivel can't persist
My flow's A-list, your flow is gayness
I think you get the gist so liten up kids
I'll be at 15 chester, weed on the dresser
I'm clever but slept on like lunesta
Peace
Who in the fuck is this dashing boy?
Who raps religiously like Pastor Troy?
Spizzy Spose is fly like asteroids?
Lyrically he's passed your boys
But where's he from? Wells, Maine
Got a lot of dollars in my wallet nah im broke
Not a baller marijuana is the product i promote
I hope people see i'm ghoulish in the face
So, they understand when I'm caught staring into space
Fly like McLaren, high like a parrot
Coughing so hard looking like i'm in hysterics
Known amongst Jareds and Dereks as the rarest
Rapper staring at your weed asking you to share it
Like Napster, Mainers jock tractors
Hold up... Rest in peace Ol' Dirty Bastard
Ol' Dirty Curtis came back from the grave
Pussies got AIDs, walking like zombies
Broken Motorolla roll of quarters for the laundry
Smoked up sitting there looking like Ghandi
Stiky-1 leather jacket looking like Fonzi
Deep in thought, creeping like the cops
Heineken bottle pops and no models give me props
Rarely touch supple couple cupped tittied city sluts
Keep it York County, what up townies
Lifted all the time like Canadian mounties
Gobble a dank, baby, Spizzy Spose if you need him and if you don't
Preposterously Dank
Wells, Maine
0-4-0-9-0
In pussies like gyno
Old school like dino with the rhyme flow
It's all good
What it does
Sorry to beat ya rappers
Meet me at the Wells House of Pizza after
Preposterously dank the album, We smoked it All mixtapes 1 through 649 coming soon
Spizzy Spose
Keep it bimpin
