I did not take to analysis 
So I had to make up my mind and hold it for a while
I would not just leave you without a kiss
But I guess there must come a time, when there's no more tears to cry
Thieves and snakes need homes, need homes
Barricade

It starts to feel like a barricade 
To keep us away, to keep us away
It kind of does 
It starts to feel like a barricade 
To keep us away, keep us away

I could not lean on the politics
'Cause I didn't want to train my eye to hold so short a time
Oh so high, just don't know where the blind could lead the sightless
But I still like to witness
Thieves and snakes need homes, need homes
Barricade

It starts to feel like a barricade 
To keep us away, to keep us away
It kind of does
It starts to feel like a barricade 
To keep us away, keep us away

Full speed, half blind
Full tilt, decline
We turn to past times
Full speed, half blind 

You know us
You know us
And we said....
I'm sorry
Say I'm sorry

Sometimes it feels like a barricade 
To keep us away, keep us away
It kind of does 
How much fear can you fabricate
To keep us away, keep us away
You know us

Full speed, half blind
Full tilt, decline
We turn to past times
Full speed, half blind

Full speed, half blind
Full tilt, decline
On to old times
Full speed, half blind
