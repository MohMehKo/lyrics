Fake out, you've already made a scene
Allow me a break now
To say it in the way you go about
"It's my time, it's my time."

When love comes, honey, take it
Only one in a hundred make it
You fake until there's nothing to fake

Someone that I'm dying to be is cruising in my blue supreme

Babe, you've already captured me
And I fake out
To say it in the way you go about
"It's my time, my time."

There's someone that I'm dying to be cruising in my blue supreme
Someone that I'm dying to be
There's someone that I'm dying to be cruising in my blue supreme

To say it in the way you go about
"My time."

When love comes, honey, show it
So many others blow it
This kind of shit don't heal in a week

Cruising in my blue supreme
Cruising in my blue supreme
Someone that I'm dying to be  
Well, nothing ever comes for free
I'm cruising in my blue supreme
Something that I'm trying to create
Just my shoes and some shake
Cruising in my blue supreme
