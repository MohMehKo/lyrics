Spare me the suspense
Spare me the suspense
I got the current seat, but I'm heaven sent
So spare me the suspense
Just spare me the suspense

Hey lady, wait
I so hope you try
You're late,
Baby know it's your time

And I won't let you sit by
So call in the kid night
Alone, you can't make amends
Now won't let you sit by
So call in the kids
Now we should dance like two fucking twins

Just spare me the suspense

There are seven ancient pawn shops along the road
And the seven aching daddies you may want to know

Oh, right on

Lady rain
Oh baby, I can't deny
I gotta taste, a taste, a taste and it's time

But I won't let you sit by
So call in the kids
Alone, you can't make amends
Now I won't let you sit by
But so call in the kids
Now that's enough with this fucking incense

Just spare me the suspense

There are seven ancient pawn shops along the road
I know seven aging daddies you may want to know
When you played your heart out
It made me turn around

Oh, right on

Wait, have you frozen in the night
You're late, there's a hole in the sky
No haste, no lesson to lie
Gotta taste that I can't deny

And you wait till you know that it's time
You wait till you know that it's time
You wait till you know that it's time
You wait till you know that it's time

You say that you set black fires, do you know?
You say that you set black fires
