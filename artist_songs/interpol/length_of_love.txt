This could be destiny
Oh sweetheart
I've had no sense of time
Since we started
I got friends in need
Oh sweetheart
I'd go lengths and lengths and lengths of love
Since we started this thing now

Combat salacious removal
Combat salacious removal

There is a bitter breed
Oh sweetheart
They will be watching you sometimes
With their bitter hearts

But we went through with these
Oh we're shifting the heartache
We want strong summer love that must roam washed up blood
Just to stay away

Combat salacious removal
Combat salacious removal
