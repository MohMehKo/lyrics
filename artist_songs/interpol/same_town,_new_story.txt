Same town, new story
They bridge a fated span
He was bound for a glory
She found her winning man

So I bet she stood by him
Through it all
I bet she stood by him
When she was pounding on the wall
She said it feels like the whole world
Is up on my shoulders
Feels like the whole world's coming down on me
(Frightening)

How many bombs went off
Cuz he just had to play his hand
His lot is a woman's duty
And she was always tougher than
(Same town, new story)
She said who's gonna save them from you?
(Same town, new story)
Who's gonna save them from you?
(Same town, new story)
I ain't gonna chase another stake until he's gone

So I bet she stood by him to the law
I bet she stood by him
When he was down on his knees
She said we're still alive
We are still alive
Feels like the whole world
Is up on my shoulders
(Coming down)
Feels like the whole world
Is up on my shoulders
(Coming down)
Feels like the whole world's coming down on me

Wide eye, venture so slowly
Venture so slowly

Why do I venture so slowly?
Venture so slowly
