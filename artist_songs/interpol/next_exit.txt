We ain't going to the town
We're going to the city
Gonna track this shit around
And make this place a heart
To be a part of
We ain't going to the town
We're going to the city
Gonna track this shit around
And make this place a heart
To be a part of
Again

We're going [x3]
And we're gone
We're going [x3]
And we're gone

So baby make it with me in preparation for tonight
We've got so much to leave
That's not what makes this right
You've been building up steam
Ignited by this fight
So do this thing with me
Instead of tying on a tight one tonight

We're going [x3]
And we're gone

We ain't going to the town
We're going to the city
Gonna track this shit around
And make this place a heart
To be a part of
Again
