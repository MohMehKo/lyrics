There's a devil in your hands, there's a devil in your hands
There's a devil in your hands, that's really not your man
But I'm not speaking for you, you're fine babe, no
There's a devil in your hands, there's a devil in your hands

I don't know what, oh, we died without saying much
So I, malfeasance, malfeasance

There's a devil in your hands, he's wringing out your plans
But I'm not preaching for you, you're fine babe, no
There's a devil in your hands, there's a devil in your hands

I don't know what, oh, we died without saying much
So I, malfeasance, malfeasance
I walk the shore, don't ask me to hide
I lock the door, I won't be denied
I must have seen some part of me that I

I see them be
I see them beneath
I see them beneath me (beneath me, beneath me)

Well I'm not speaking for you, you're fine babe, no
There's a devil in your hands, that's really not your man

Well I don't know what, oh, we lied and not saying much
So I, malfeasance, malfeasance
I walk the shore, don't ask me to hide
I lock the door, I won't be denied
I must have seen some part of me

I see them be
I see them beneath
I see them beneath me
I see them be
I see them beneath me
I see them be
I see them beneath me
Beneath me

Idle eye, the whole world is blind
Idle eye, the whole world is blind
Idle eyes, the whole world is blind
Idle eyes, the whole world is blind
