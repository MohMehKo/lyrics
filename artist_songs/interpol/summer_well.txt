The fevered plastics that seal your body
They won't stop this rain hey hey
I was your eye in the night when the prophets fell
I said it looks like you summer well

I want to stay magical
I want to stay yearning
(Nobody told you, nobody told you)
I want to feel up on your life
I miss you but it looks like you summered well

All the while all the protests have shined the same
But you will never notice
It's alright
I rely on the process, don't mind the frame
They will never take this dream from me

It's alright
Make it back
It's alright
It's all the way behind us
It's alright

I miss you babe
I want you back
The signs we gave
Weren't those signs supposed to last?

The rainy days
The summer's back
The signs we gave
So what was that?

You know we have ways to make the seasons
just these ones
So let me take this cover your eyes
look away until it fades

All the while all the protests have shined the same
But you will never notice
It's alright
I rely on the process, don't mind the frame
They will never take this dream from me

It's alright
(Dream from me) 
It's alright
huuu huuu huu
You sent me
It's alright
You sent me
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
(You sent me)
