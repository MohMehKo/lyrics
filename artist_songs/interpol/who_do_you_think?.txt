Slow decay, I won't stop fighting yeah
Who do you think that is there?
I came to fight, I am in the air
I know you follow the body
Let go now to the coast of hypnotic we go
I only call them when I know
I don't see them
I only call them when I know
I don't see them
Who do you think that is there?
I show beyond so beyond compare
I always fall in these fights I know why
Always fall in these fights I know why
Controlling the agents takes a toll on my brain
Now who do you think that is there?
Only call them when I know
I don't see them.
I only call them when I know
I don't see them.
Slow decay, I won't
Who do you think that is there?
By interest strike leading out of despair
I know you follow the body, Let go now
to the coast of hypnotic that won't stop now
If making a taste for me
you're making your own way
Now who do you think, I said who do you think now?
Oh, how I pass the days, you know how much I care
Oh, through the wax and waning, you know I will be there
Oh, at your faded grace I know now not to stare
Slow decay, I won't stop fighting yeah
Who do you think that is there?
I came to fight, I am in the air
I always fall in these fights I know why
And from the birth strings of life I go right
But controlling the agents takes a toll on my brain
Now who do you think that is there?
I only call them when I know
I don't see them
I only call them when I know
I don't see them
