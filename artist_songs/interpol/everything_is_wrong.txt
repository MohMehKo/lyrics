Truly, truly, truly real

Enter the override, how we run the game
Sleeker and cheaper, the wind changed
Following deeper, they hear what I say
Spectral incentives have paved the way

Everything is wrong, oh, everything is wrong
I guess we hope in time what is now is overcome

I think I know why, I say what I say
Inverse achievements, I rue the days
Am I more soulful, or am I coming down now?
Can we start over as agents of peace?

Everything is wrong, oh, everything is wrong
All we have is time, but my heart is going numb
It's taken a part of both of us
And nobody likes to wait
Everything is wrong, truly wrong, everything is wrong
Everything is wrong

Truly, truly, truly real

Oh love, hold on, hold on, hold on
Oh love, hold on, hold on, hold on

We made our home, without begging your pardon
We made our home, with time alone
It's taken apart the best of us
But nobody likes to wait
Everything is wrong, truly wrong, everything is wrong
