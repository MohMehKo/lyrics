Why don't you see it?
Why don't you feel me?
I won't be keeped
You are misteaching me

Cave on, stay showed, ah

I got you seeking my company
I have to build through those eyes
To see that world complete
That world comes to me

I can show you what is what
I can show you how you're upgrading
Now that I know you
I can show you how it works

I saw you speaking, I don't believed
You're not of speaking
I have to lead you to change
This change I can lead, honey

You got your secrets
Your sacred team
I'm not betraying your eyes to leave that come me
With no complications

I can show you what is what
I can show you how you're upgrading
Now that I know you
I can show you how to getting comfort
I can show you how this works
I can show you how to getting comfort

It's a little tossing world
Positioned in time
And smiling, put that's all behind
It's my world, it's peaceful
It's very kind
Inside this, I leave your eyes
Talk to me

Now that I'm knowing you
I can show you what is what
Now that I'm knowing you
I can show you how to getting comfort
Stopped, letting go
I can show you how it works

I can show you what is what
I can show you how you're upgrading
Now that I know you
I can show you how it works
