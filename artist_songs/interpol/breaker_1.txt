Come back, come back, I'm the warning
Come back, come back, breaker one
(Come back, come back, breaker one)
Come back, come back, I'm the warning
Come back, come back, breaker one
(I'm the warning)
Come back, come back, breaker one

You see the way
When I hold you tight
Asleep beside me
There is a slope like an appetite we descend slowly
And I fear my deep makeup
The ache inside, go away
The vacant mind just relay
Some explosion from the bright side

Come back, come back, I'm the warning
Come back, come back, breaker one
Come back, come back, I'm the warning
Come back, come back, breaker one
Come back, come back, breaker one

You see the way how it happens right
The beast inside me
He leads the way
Then he's at my side
We feast til I'm starving
And I feel my deep makeup, the ache inside, go away
Am I aping some old holiday
Some remnants of a wild side
I'm inclined
Cuz I've seen my dreams defied
And I'll take my turns in stride
Just speed my feet away

Come back, come back, I'm the warning
Come back, come back, breaker one

Day's begun
Grace become
Babe this week I just went through so much and
went through so much darling
And I've seen my deep makeup
The ache inside go away
The patience to climb all day
The remnants of a mountain
I'm inclined
Cuz I need my needs to get by
And I've paid my turns in kind
Just speed my feet away

Come back, come back, I'm the warning
Come back, come back, breaker one
