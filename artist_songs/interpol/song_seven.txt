You can't still 
Yeah you fell too fast 
You come at thhe right time 
Yeah yo come too fast 
You bloom in the spring 
Yeah you move the sky
You come in singing 
Yeah you come in right out
You were like a cloud 
Yes you were a flower
When you where alive 
Now our love is sour
You were like a cloud 
Yes you were a flower
When you where alive 
Now our love is sour
Give up
Don't give up
Don't give up 
Don't give up
You were like a cloud 
Yes you were a flower
When you where alive 
Now our love is sour
You were like a cloud 
Yes you were a flower
When you where alive 
Now our love is sour
You were like a cloud 
Yes you were a flower
When you where alive 
Now our love is sour
You were like a cloud 
Yes you were a flower
When you where alive 
Now our love is sour
Start again buttercup 
Start again buttercup
Start again buttercup
Start again 
Oh start again dear
Last look 
At what we had
I gave in to when we went here
When you lost your nurses
I found you a docter in me
Oh in me 
Do right
