Can it be true?
Nobody warned you,
Nobody told you, to make up your mind.

Nobody told you, that I could just waltz through and shake up your style.

I'm Inside, like a wrecking ball through your eyes,
And I change it all from inside.

Strange and fine,
All this hardware slow in time,
And no one's for me,
Go inside,
Going somewhere, bonus tactile,
And no one's for me,
Open wide, you're like new year.

Stay and fight,
Stay and fight,
stay and fight.
