Innocent idols who turn me on
While selling bibles to babies
We sleep for a while but then you are gone
All I have left is the story

All I can see before me is the darkest blues
Because I slip to the depths without you

If I met a waitress could she turn me on
I got the time to let her know me
I keep my focus but my dreams keeps me strong
I come abreast of it slowly

All I can see before me is the darkest blue
Because I slip to the depths without you

So many hours that I see before me
Now the stars are out of view
Because I slip to the depths without you
