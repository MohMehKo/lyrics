It's the place that's said to break
It's just as safe from the outside tonight

And I want that
I face the storms at the tides
From the lighthouse

And I want that
Unleash the storm and the night

Oh...

What do the waves have to say now?
What do the waves have to say now?

Slow now

And let the waves have their way now
Slow, and let the waves have their day

And I want that

Here I've been living on roofs made from sin
Upward and outward, "Begin, begin."

Here I've been lucid I'm living within
Inwardly urgent, I'm sinking again

The Lighthouse
