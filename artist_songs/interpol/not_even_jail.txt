I'll lay down my glasses
I'll lay down in houses
If things come alive
I'll subtract pain by ounces
Yeah, I will start painting houses
If things come alive
I promise to commit no acts of violence
Neither physical or otherwise
If things come alive
I'll say it now
I'll say it now
Say it now
Oh I'll say it now
Cause I want it now

When personality is scarred tissue
We travel South if it's use
I'm subtle like a lion's cage
Such a cautious display
Remember take hold of your time here
Give some meanings to the means
To your end
Not even jail

We marshal in the days of longing
We tremble like anyone's children
And wait to watch the fire
Repairing on the side of caution
Betraying no other symptom
But girl you shake it right
I will bounce you on the lap of silence
We will free love to the beats of science
And girl you shake it right
I'll say it now

Oh but hold still darling your hair so free
Can't you feel all the warmth of my sincerity
You make motion when you cry
You're making peoples lives feel less private
Don't take time away
You make motion when you cry
We all hold hands
can't we all hold hands
When we make new friends

I pretend like no one else
To try to control myself
I'm subtle like a lion's cage
Such a cautious display
Remember take hold of your time here
Give some meanings to the means
To your end
Not even jail
