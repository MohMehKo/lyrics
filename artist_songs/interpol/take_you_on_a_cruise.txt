I'm timeless like a broken watch
And make money like Fred Astaire
I see that you've come to resist me
I'm a pitbull in time
The pretence is not what restricts me
It's the circles inside
An anatomy of kisses
And a teacher who tries
And knows how we'll disappear
Would you like to be my Missus
And a future with child
You know we can't get back from here
We can get away

Baby won't you try to find me
Baby won't you try to fight
Baby won't you try to find me
Maybe it will be alright

Along the way
Tears drown in the wake of delight
There's nothing like this built today
You'll never see a finer ship in your life
We sail today
Tears drown in the wake of delight
There's nothing like this built today
You'll never see a finer ship
Or see a better tip in your life

I am the scavenger
Between the sheets of union
Lately I can't tell for sure
whether machines turn anyone
Are you the scavenger?
Between the sheets of union
Lately I can't tell for sure
whether machines turn anyone

Lady won't you try to find me
Lady there is no need to fight
Lady won't you try to find me
Lady it will be alright

We sail today
Tears drown in in the wake of delight
There's nothing like this built today
You'll never see a finer ship in your life
Along the way
The sea will crowd us with lovers at night
There's nothing like this built today
You'll never see a finer ship
Or receive a better tip in your life

I see that you've come to resist me
I'm a pitbull in time

White Goddess, red Goddess
Black temptress of the sea, you treat me right
Black Goddess, red Goddess
White temptress of the sea, you treat me right

Oh my love is sailing to Norway.
All my love we're leaving tonight

White Goddess, black Goddess
Red temptress of the sea, you treat me right
White Goddess, red Goddess
Black Temptress of the sea, you treat me right
