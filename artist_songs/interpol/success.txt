Dreams of long life,
What safety can you find?
See the great unknown
that shapes for miles
Good eye
I'm a good guy

Dreams of long life
What safety can you find?
If the sea was that strong
Maybe we had
Maybe we had to fly
Was a good try
I'm a good guy

As high as the day
I read the papers
Before crime would pay
I'll learn to bury most beliefs

I have succeeded
I won't compete for long
I'm not not supposed to show you
I've got two secrets
But I only told you one

Dreams of long life
What safety can you buy?
If the sea will start strong
Maybe we had
Maybe we had to fly
Somebody make me say no, no, no
Somebody make me say no, no, no
Somebody make me say no, no, no
Somebody make me say no, no, no

I have succeeded
I won't compete for long
I'm not not supposed to show you
I've got two secrets
But I only told you one

I'm not not supposed to show you
I'm not not supposed to
I'm not not supposed to show you
I'm not not supposed to
