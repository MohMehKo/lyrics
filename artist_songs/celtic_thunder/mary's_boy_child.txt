Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible said
Mary’s boy child Jesus Christ was born on Christmas Day
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a new king born today
And man will live forevermore, because of Christmas Day

While shepherds watched their flocks by night, they saw a bright new shining star
And heard a choir from heaven sing, the music came from afar
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a new king born today
And man will live forevermore, because of Christmas Day

Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight
By night they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and ark, Mary’s little boy child was born

Trumpets sound and angels sing, listen to what they say
That man will live forevermore, because of Christmas Day
Trumpets sound and angels sing, listen to what they say
That man will live forevermore, because of Christmas Day
That man will live forevermore, because of Christmas Day
