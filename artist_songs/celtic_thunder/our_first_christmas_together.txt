Don't mind the snow that's falling 
The carol singers calling 
I'm just happy 
To be spending our first Christmas 
Together 

And I'll be more than jolly 
With the mistletoe and holly 
Tonight as we are counting down to Christmas 
Together 
Just you and me 

With those jingle bells ringing 
As I'm holding you near 
I'll be making a toast 
May tonight be the most 
Unforgettable night of the year 

The sound of 
Jingle bells and laughter 
Will remind us ever after 
Of how we spent that magical first Christmas 
Together 
Just you and me 
Just you and me 

With those jingle bells ringing 
As I'm holding you near 
I'll be making a toast 
May tonight be the most 
Unforgettable night of the year 
The year 

Cuddled up and cozy 
The future's looking rosy 
And I can see us spending every Christmas 
Together 
Just you and me 
Just you and me 
Just you and me 
Just you and me
