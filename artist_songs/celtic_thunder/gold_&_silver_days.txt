As I sit here by the fireside 
I'm turning back the years. 
I can hear my mother singing in the morning 
As she scrubbed our shining faces 
And then packed us off to school. 
All too soon those days were over without warning. 

[Chorus]
So sing me the songs of our gold and silver days, 
Days filled with innocence and light. 
Not a penny to our name, 
We were happy just the same 
In our gold and silver days. 

In the parlour on a Friday night, 
My father took the floor. 
I can hear us join together in the chorus, 
Singing "Just a Song at Twilight" 
And "The Moon behind the Hill". 
Now those voices are all silenced, gone before us. 

[Chorus]

We gathered at the Daisy Field 
On Sunday afternoon, 
And we danced to Johnny Quigley and the Royal. 
Through the years we all were scattered, 
But our friends were good and true, 
Always there when they were needed, always loyal. 

[Chorus]
