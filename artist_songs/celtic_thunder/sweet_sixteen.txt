When first I saw the love light in your eyes
I dreamt the world held nought but joy for me
And even though we drifted far apart
I never dream but what I dream of thy

I love you as I've never loved before
Since first I met you on the village green
Come to me e'er my dream of love is o're
I love you as I loved you, when you were sweet
When you were sweet sixteen

Last night I dreamt I held your hand in mine
And once again you were my happy bride
I kissed you as I did on 'Auld Lang Syne'
As to the church we wandered side by side

I love you as I've never loved before
Since first I met you on the village green
Come to me e'er my dream of love is o're
I love you as I loved you, when you were sweet
When you were sweet sixteen
