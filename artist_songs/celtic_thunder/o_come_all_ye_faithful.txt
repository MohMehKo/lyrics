Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the king of angels
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

See how the shepherds
Summoned to His cradle
Leaving their flocks, draw nigh to gaze
We too will thither 
Lend our joyful footsteps
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

Sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing all ye citizens of heavâ€™n above
Glory to God
Glory in the highest
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

Hail, Lord, we greet Thee
Born this happy morning
Jesu, forever be Thy name adored
Son of the Father
Now in flesh appearing
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
