Imtheochaidah soir is siar
a dtainig ariamh
an ghealach is an ghrian

fol lol the doh fol the day
fol the doh, fol the day

Imtheochaidh an ghealach's an ghrian
An Daonine og is a chail 'na dhiadh

fol lol the doh fol the day
fol the doh, fol the day

fol lol the doh fol the day
fol the doh, fol the day

Imtheochaidah a dtainig ariamh
An duine og is a chail ne dhiadh

fol lol the doh fol the day
fol the doh, fol the day

[Translation:]

I will go east and west 
(To the places) from whence came
The moon and the sun

The moon and the sun will go
And the young man
With his reputation behind him

I will go wherever he came from-
The young man with his reputation behind him
