Hear our hymn from the heartland.
Hear our prayer.
Steer us through stormy waters
Lead us there...

When the storm is raging,
And thunder rolls,
Deliver us from the ocean
Save our souls.

A thiarna dean trocaire [Irish for "Lord have Mercy"]
A chriost dean trocaire [Irish for "Christ have Mercy"]
A thiarna dean trocaire
A chriost dean trocaire

When the winds are howling
Vigil keep
Shelter us and save us from the deep

A thiarna dean trocaire
A chriost dean trocaire
A thiarna dean trocaire
A chriost dean trocaire

Thank you Lord you have brought us safe to shore
Be our strength and protection evermore.
