Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the land snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, oh, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is a new bird
And he's singing a song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

Well, in the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married , we'll say, "No, man"
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire to face unafraid
All the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland

Well, in the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your noes gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play
The Eskimo way

Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
