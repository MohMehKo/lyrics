O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Saviorâ€™s birth
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks, a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when was Christ was born

Truly He taught us
To love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall he break
For the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease

Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name
Christ is the Lord
His name forever praise we
Noel, Noel
Oh night, oh night divine
Noel, Noel 
Oh night, oh night divine

Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when was Christ was born

Oh night divine
Oh night, oh night divine
