Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk
Of a day -I-ay-I-ay
I met a little girl and we stopped to talk
On a grand soft day -I-ay-I-ay
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue
And I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl
Down the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl

We were halfway there when the rain came down
On a day -I-ay-I-ay
And she took me up to her flat downtown
On a fine soft day -I-ay-I-ay
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do
If her hair was black and her eyes were blue
So I took her hand and I gave her a twirl
And I lost my heart to a Galway girl

But when I woke up I was all alone
With a broken heart and a ticket home
And I ask you friend, what's a fella to do
If her hair was black and her eyes were blue
See I've traveled around I've been all over the world
I've never seen nothin' like a Galway girl

And I ask you friend, what's a fella to do
If her hair was black and her eyes were blue
See I've traveled around I've been all over the world
I've never seen nothin' like a Galway girl
