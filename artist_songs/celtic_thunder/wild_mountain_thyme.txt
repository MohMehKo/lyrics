Oh the summer time is comin'
And the leaves are sweetly bloomin'
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the bloomin' heather
Will you go, lassie, go?

And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the bloomin' heather
Will you go, lassie, go?

I will build my love a bower
By yon pure crystal fountain
And on it I will place
All the flowers of the mountain
Will you go, lassie, go?

And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the bloomin' heather
Will you go, lassie, go?

If my true love she were gone
I'd surely find another
Where the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the bloomin' heather
Will you go, lassie, go?

And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the bloomin' heather
Will you go, lassie, go?

And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the bloomin' heather
Will you go, lassie, go?
