When I dream, I'll be dreaming of Noreen
And the love that I'm leaving behind me.
And the twilight will always remind me
Of my Noreen, Mo Storin, my love.

Every night, I'll be thinking of Noreen
And the way I would cuddle and kiss her.
Every bone in my body will miss her.
My Noreen, Mo Storin, my love.

I curse the day that I left her
And the people who drove me away.
It's worse than I ever imagined,
Oh God, it gets harder each day.

I curse the day that I left her
And the people who drove me away.
It's worse than I ever imagined,
Oh God, it gets harder each day.

So I pray when my exile is over,
With the pain and the heartache behind us,
Back in the peace of the valley you'll find us-
My Noreen, Mo Storin, and me.
Back in the peace of the valley, that's where we will be-
My Noreen, Mo Storin, and me.
