Mary, did you know
That your baby boy 
Would some day walk on water?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy
Would save our sons and daughters?
Did you know
That your baby boy has come to make you new?
This child that you delivered 
Will soon deliver you

Mary, did you know
That your baby boy
Would give sight to a blind man?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy
Would calm the sea with His hand?
Did you know
That your baby boy has walked where angels trod?
When you kiss your little baby
Then you’ve kissed the face of God

Mary, did you know
Ooo...

The blind will see
The deaf will hear
The dead will live again
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of the Lamb

Mary, did you know
That your baby boy
Is Lord of all creation?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy
Would some day rule the nations?
Did you know
That your baby is heaven’s perfect Lamb?
The sleeping child you’re holding is the Great I Am

Mary, did you know?
