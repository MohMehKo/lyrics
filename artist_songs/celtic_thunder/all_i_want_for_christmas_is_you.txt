I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
You make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
Don't care about presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day

And I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
You make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, you, baby, woah

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I don't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

And I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
All I want for Christmas is you, you, baby, woah

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air

And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just just one thing I need
I just want to see baby
Standing right outside my door

And I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
You make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, you, baby, woah
You, all I want for Christmas is you
