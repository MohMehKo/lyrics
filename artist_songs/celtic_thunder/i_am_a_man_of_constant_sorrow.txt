(In constant sorrow, all through his days.)

I am the man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
I bid farewell to ol' Kentucky
The place where I was born and raised.

(The place where he was born and raised)

For six long years I've been in trouble,
no pleasure here on earth I've found
For in this world, I'm bound to ramble,
I have no friends to help me now.

(He has no friends to help him now)

It's fair thee well, my old true lover,
I ne’er expect to see you again.
For I'm bound to ride that Northern Railroad,
perhaps I'll die upon this train

(Perhaps he'll die upon this train)

You can bury me in some deep valley,
For many years where I may lay.
And you may learn to love another
while I am sleeping in my grave.
(While he is sleeping in his grave)

Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
My face you’ll never see no more
But there is one promise that is given,
I'll meet you on Gods golden shore

(He'll meet you on God's golden shore)
