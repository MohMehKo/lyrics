Take a bus, who needs a car.
We'll eat here, close by the door.
I'm not very hungry now are you?
Is it ok, if I share yours with you?
I've got no money and I think, I believe that you knew.

Remember the moon, on the water how she'd shine?
The taste of the sheets, and the feel of the wine.
Wasn't I glad, that you were mine
In the Grande Affaire?

Take a boat, or maybe a plane,
Anywhere now except Greece or Spain.
For sure I know where I am,
I see canals, this is Amsterdam.
Friends here and they know, they can say who I am.

Remember the room without any view?
Frightened we'd meet, someone that we knew,
No farewells or how-do-you-dos
In the Grande Affaire.

Now I stay, at the best hotels,
And there's white coated waiters attend me,
And I look, at the beautiful girls,
Do they really believe they can win me?

I drive now, it's seldom I walk.
Speak French, but I'd rather not talk.
And which suit will I wear tonight?
Take out the brown, but in the end wear the white.
After shade stepping out, stepping into the light.

Remember the moon on the water how she'd shine,
The year was all wrong, so we sent back the wine,
And wasn't I glad that you were mine,
In the Grande Affaire?
