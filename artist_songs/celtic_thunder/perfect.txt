I don't want half-hearted love affairs
I need someone who really cares.
Life is too short to play silly games
I've promised myself I won't do that again.

It's got to be perfect,
It's got to be worth it. Yeah!
Too many people take second best
But I won't take anything less
It's got to be Mmmm!
Perfect.

Young hearts are foolish they make such mistakes
They're much too eager to give their love away.
Well I have been foolish too many times
But now I'm determined I'm gonna get it right.

It's got to be perfect,
It's got to be worth it. Yeah!
Too many people take second best
But I won't take anything less
It's got to be Mmmm!
