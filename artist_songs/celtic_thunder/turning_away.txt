In darkness we do what we can
In daylight we're oblivion
Our hearts so raw and clear
Are turning away, turning away from here

On the water we have walked
Like the fearless child
What was fastened we've unlocked
Revealing wondrous wild
And in search of confirmation
We have jumped into the fire
And scrambled with our burning feet
Through uncontrolled desire

In darkness we do what we can
In daylight we're oblivion
Our hearts so raw and clear
Are turning away, turning away from here

There's a well upon the hill
From our ancient past
Where an age is standing
Still holding strong and fast
And there's those that try to tame it
And to carve it into stone
Ah but words cannot extinguish it
However hard they're thrown

In darkness we do what we can
In daylight we're oblivion
Our hearts so raw and clear
Are turning away, turning away from here

By Loch Etive they have worked
With their highland dreams
By Kilcrennan they have nourished
In the mountain streams.
And in searching for acceptance
They had given it away
Only the children of their children know
The price they had to pay

In darkness we do what we can
In daylight we're oblivion
Our hearts so raw and clear
Are turning away, turning away from here
