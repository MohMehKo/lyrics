So it goes, history shows, deserts must expand
Camels sail like wooden ships, like women down the strand
There's sand on second avenue and the wind blows like a train
Taxis line up like a string of pearls, around the block again

I remember everything and every window pane
Every word came back to me the way it used to be
Then I saw your face across the street
Through the tears of Hercules

You said love wrecks everything and none of us survive
But I got over you last night and I am still alive
Till I saw your face across the street
Through the tears of Hercules

You said love wrecks everything and none of us survive
But I got over you last night and I am still alive
Till I saw your face across the street
Through the tears of Hercules
