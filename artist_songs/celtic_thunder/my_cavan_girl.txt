As I walk the road from Killashandra
Weary I'm sat down
For it's twelve long miles around the lake
To get to Cavan town
Though Ougher and the road I go
Once seemed beyond compare
Now I curse the time it takes to reach
My Cavan girl so fair

The autumn shades are on the leaves
The trees will soon be bare
Each red-gold leaf around me seems the colours of her hair
My gaze retreats to find my feet
And once again I sigh
For the broken pool of sky reminds me
The colours of her eye

At the Cavan Cross each Sunday morning
Where she can be found
And she seems to have the eye of every boy in Cavan town
If my luck will hold I'll have the golden summer of her smile
And to break the hearts of Cavan men
She'll talk to me a while

So next Sunday evening finds me homeward - Killashandra bound
To work the week, till I return and court in Cavan town
When asked if she would be my bride at least she'd not said "no"
So next Sunday morning, rouse myself, and back to her I'll go

As I walk the road from Killashandra
Weary I'm sat down
For it's twelve long miles around the lake
To get to Cavan town
Though Ougher and the road I go
Once seemed beyond compare
Now I curse the time it takes to reach
My Cavan girl so fair
Now I curse the time it takes to reach
My Cavan girl so fair
