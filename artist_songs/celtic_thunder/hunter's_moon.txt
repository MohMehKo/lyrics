I'm moving on now
No more to say
Time I was gone now
Why would I stay?

Don't rake the ashes
I'll take the lashes
You go now
I'll walk away.

No cause to wonder
No one's immune
I kissed you under
The hunterâ€™s moon.

You wander free now
Don't look for me now
You go now
Before you,
Find your dreams are strewn
Beneath that icy hunter's moon
Dying all too soon
Beneath the hunter's savage moon

Time I was gone now
Anchors aweigh
I'm moving on now
Just one more day

I'll let you go now
How do we know though?
Who hunted?
Who was the prey?

You and I
Flew too high
Now we're falling free
Through the night
Burning bright
And colder than the sea

Now our dreams are strewn
Beneath that icy hunter's moon
Dying all too soon
Beneath the hunter's savage moon

Souls are out of tune
That kiss beneath that hunter's moon
Harsh and out of tune
And cursed to wander here and there forever,
Like the lonely moon.
