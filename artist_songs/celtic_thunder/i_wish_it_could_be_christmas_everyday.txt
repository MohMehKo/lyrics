When the snowman brings the snow
Well, he just might like to know
He's put a great big smile on somebody's face

And if you jump into your bed
Quickly cover up your head
Don't you lock your door
You know the sweet Santa Claus is on his way

Well, I wish it could be Christmas every day
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas every day
So let the bells ring out for Christmas

When we're skating in the park
If the storm clouds paint it dark
Then your rosy cheeks gonna light my merry way

Now the frosticals appeared
And they've frozen up my ear
So we'll lie by the fire
'Til the sleep simply melts them all away

Well, I wish it could be Christmas every day
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas every day
So let the bells ring out for Christmas
(Wish it could be Christmas, oh, I wish it could be Christmas)

Well, I wish it could be Christmas every day
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas every day
So let the bells ring out for Christmas

Well, I wish it could be Christmas every day
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play, woah, ooh
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas every day
So let the bells ring out for Christmas
So let the bells ring out for Christmas
