I'll take you home again, Kathleen
Across the ocean wild and wide
To where your heart has ever been
Since first you were my bonnie bride
The roses all have left your cheeks
I've watched them fade away and die
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak
And tears bedim your loving eyes

So I will take you back, Kathleen
To where your heart will feel no pain
And when the fields are fresh and green
Oh, I'II take you to your home Kathleen

Your voice is sad when e'er you speak
And tears bedim your loving eyes

Oh I will take you back, Kathleen
To where your heart will feel no pain
And when the fields are fresh and green
Oh, I'II take you to your home again

And when the fields are fresh and green
Oh, I'II take you to your home Kathleen
