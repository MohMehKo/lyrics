Now keep this promise
And never break it
I know you'll be back soon
How long's it this time

Another lifetime
All I want is to be with you
So hold me in your arms
Don't let go, take me with you...
When will you come back to me

I'm falling for you now
I'm falling for you now
I'm Gonna catch the world for you
Wrap it up, it's all for you

I've fallng for you now
I'm making my way back home
Just to see your face
Rosa, Rosa

Now don't you worry
I never left you
I am the angel by your side
We've made this promise
We'll never break it

Your in my heart
Your always on my mind
So hold me in your arms
Don't let go, take me with you
When will you come back to me

I'm Falling for you now
You know I'm falling for you now
I'm gonna catch the world for you
And wrap it up, it's all for you

I'm falling for you now
I'm making my way back home
Just to see your face
Rosa, Rosa, Rosa, Rosa

Now don't you worry
I've never left you
