Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it’s lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling “yoo hoo”
Come on, it’s lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We’re snuggled up together like
Birds of a feather would be

Let’s take a road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it’s lovely weather

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus lane
Vixen and Blitzen, and all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say your prayers
‘Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

(Santa Claus is coming tonight, Santa Claus is coming tonight)

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus lane
He’s got a bag that’s filled with toys
For boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
What a beautiful sight
Jump in bed, cover up your head
‘Cause Santa Claus is coming tonight

The toy shop door is locked up tight
And everything is quiet for the night
When suddenly, the clock strikes twelve
The fun’s begun

The dolls are in their best arrayed
There’s going to be a wonderful parade
Hark to the drum, oh, here they come
Cries everyone

Hear them all cheering
Now they are nearing
There's the captain stiff as starch
Bayonets flashing
Music is crashing
As the wooden soldiers march
Sabers a-clinking
Soldiers a-winking
At each pretty little maid

Here they come, here they come
Here they come, here they come
Wooden soldiers on parade

You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I’m telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

He’s making a list, checking it twice
Gonna find out who’s naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you’re sleeping
He knows when you’re awake
He knows if you’ve been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I’m telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn’t see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep
Then, I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus
