Oh, the weather outside is frightful
The fire is so delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbyeing
As long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I bought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh, the fire is slowing dying
An,d my dear, we're still goodbyeing
As long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
