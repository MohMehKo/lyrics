Going home for Christmas, can't wait to 
Be on my way to see once more the folks 
I've been missing is long and many a day, 
Can't wait to get that old feeling being back 
Where I belong, I've saved my fare and I'll 
Soon be there, it's Christmas and I'm 
Going home. 

Going home for Christmas, and the welcome 
That's waiting there I'll say goodbye to the lights 
Of Broadway fairwell to old Time Square, 
Thought my home is plain and simple it's 
The place where I was born, and pleeker 
Street just can't compete, it's Christmas 
And I'm going home. 

I've saved my fare, and I'll soon be there , 
It's Christmas and I'm going home. 

Going home for Christmas, the way 
That it used to be see the candle 
Burning there in the window the fairy 
Lights on the tree ,hear the laughter 
Of the children, see the wonder in there 
Eyes bring, on the snow and the mistletoe, 
It's Christmas and I'm going home. 

So bring on the snow, and the mistletoe, 
It's Christmas and I'm going home. 

I'm going home.
