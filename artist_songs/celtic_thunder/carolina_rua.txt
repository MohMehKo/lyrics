Stories never end ’til you come to conclusion
Mo Carolina Rua has a hand in my confusion.

She waits for me to choose which quarter to bend in.
To susie-make-me-blue, or the redhead I’m attending.

Now Carolina Rua has my heart and all I want to do
Is go down the winding road where my Carolina goes:
Down the crooked road where Carolina goes to
Mo Carolina Rua, do you love me?
Tell me true,   Carolina ooh oh ooh oh

Standing on three queens, I thought the game was over.
Then, out from the blue, Carolina’s at my shoulder:

with laughter in her eyes and a smile that touches all the guys
On down the winding road where my Carolina goes:
Down the crooked road where Carolina goes to
Mo Carolina Rua, do you love me?
Tell me true,   Carolina ooh oh ooh oh

Mo Carolina Rua has my heart and all I want to do
Is go down the winding road where my Carolina goes:
Down the crooked road where Carolina goes to ,
Mo Carolina Rua, do you love me?
Tell me true, Tell me true.
Mo Carolina Rua
