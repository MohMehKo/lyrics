Tumbling curls of green by the stained glass streaming light
And a yellow coloured lampshade used to keep us up all night
The smile upon your face, the tears upon your cheek
And the night sky on the window
Your heart calling out to me.

Come running home again, Katie
Come running home again
Cross my heart and hope to die
Shall I cause another tear from your eye

The mirror that won't talk and your nightgown on the door
And the old pedal Singer just don't sing no more
You can roll the reels for hours
From the movie of this book
It's a question mark on this heart of mine
sends an elder back to look.

Come running home again, Katie
Come running home again
Cross my heart and hope to die
Shall I cause another tear from your eye

Now I'm looking through a tunnel back into the room
With the genius of a Druid when the sunlight floods the tomb
And I'm never going back there I couldn't anyway
And though I made the great escape
I never got away

Come running home again, Katie
Come running home again
Cross my heart and hope to die
Shall I cause another tear from your eye

Come running home again, Katie
Come running home again
Cross my heart and hope to die
Shall I cause another tear from your eye
