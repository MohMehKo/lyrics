Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
And the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten, twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, well, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

Happy Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, "I love you", I meant it
But now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me, you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
And the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special, woah

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover when you tore me apart
Ooh, now, now that I found real love
You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special, woah

Gave you my heart
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Oh, oh, oh, oh, last Christmas
