There's a tear in your eye
And I'm wondering why
For it never should be there at all
With such pow'r in your smile
Sure a stone you'd be guile
So there's never a teardrop should fall
When your sweet lilting laughter's
Like some fairy song
And your eyes twinkle bright as can be
You must laugh all the while
And all other times smile
And now, smile a smile for me

When Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, 'tis like the morning Spring
In the lilt of Irish laughter
You can hear the angels sing
When Irish hearts are happy
All the world seems bright and gay
What when Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, they steal your heart away

For your smile is a part
Of the love in your heart
And it makes even sunshine more bright
Like the linnet's sweet song
Crooning all the day long
Comes your laughter and light
For the springtime of life
Is the sweetest of all
And there's ne'er a real care or regret
And while springtime is ours
Throughout all of youth's hours
Let us smile each chance we get

When Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, 'tis like the morning Spring
In the lilt of Irish laughter
You can hear the angels sing
When Irish hearts are happy
All the world seems bright and gay
And when Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, they steal your heart away

When Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, 'tis like the morning Spring
In the lilt of Irish laughter
You can hear the angels sing
When Irish hearts are happy
All the world seems bright and gay
What when Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, they steal your heart away
