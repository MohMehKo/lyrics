The Edge Of The Moon
She sings him a song
He loves to listen
He reads her a story
She plays a sweet tune
Chopin and Mozart she loves with her heart
Her guardian angel, looks down from the moon

He rings the bells nightly
She prays for their freedom
He stands at the pulpit
She stays in her room
Scarlatti and Haydn, she loves with her heart
Her guardian angel looks down from the moon

She prays for the vision
He hopes she won’t see it
She wishes for winter
He knows it won’t come
Summer and Autumn cry whisper the wind song
Her guardian angel looks down from the moon

He closes the curtains
She takes to her bed now
He waits in the doorway
She stays in her room
Beautiful music sweet songs filled with glory
Her guardian angel looks down from the moon
She waves her goodbye from, the edge of the moon
