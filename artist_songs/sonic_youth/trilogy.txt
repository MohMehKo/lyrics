[The Wonder]

[Thurston]
See flashing eyes
They're flashing cross to me
Burnin up the sky
Sunshinin to me
Yr locus crown
Copkillin heartbeat
Head's lookin down
Bowin out to the street

I'm just walking around
Yr city is a wonder town

Lips red to white
Lips green in blacked night
Yr spirit flares
Flarin up leonine

I'm just walking around
Yr city is a wonder town

Transmitter rhyme
Transmitter all the time
Lookin up to the sky
I'm seeing ghosts flyin

I'm just walkin around
Yr city is a wonder town

I think I been there once before
Something tells me there's so much more
She's back in town to even the score
Time to go

See flashing eyes
They're flashing 'cross to me
Burnin' up the sky
Sunshining into me
Your locus crown
Cop-killin' heartbeat
Head's lookin' down
Bowin' out, to the street

I'm just walkin' around
Your city is a wonder town

[Hyperstation]

[Thurston]
Falling out of sleep, I hit the floor
Put on some rock tee and I'm out with the door
From Bowery to Broome to Greene, I'm a walking lizard
Last night's dream was a talking baby lizard

All comin' from hu-man imagination
Day dreaming days in a daydream nation

Smashed-up against a car at three A.M.
Kids just up for basketball, beat me in my head
There's bum trash in my hall and my place is ripped
I've totaled another amp, I'm calling in sick

It's an anthem in a vacuum on a hyperstation
Day dreaming days in a daydream nation

[Kim]
Kids cruise away, pack of chickenshits
This guy is ours, dark stains on his pants
Enough to make a butcher out of the bone
Take a walk in the park? Shit, yeah!

A poor boy, a rich boy
A poor rich boy coming right through me
Rich boy, poor boy
Poor rich boy coming right through me
