We did not fade from the noise meditation
We stopped abruptly while spinning down
This is not to depict hesitation
A silent gesture-for princess pleasure
Oh see what heaven sent -oh stright from
Heavens gate
Oh see what heaven meant-when it embraces
Hate

Elastic dreemz of vicious aktions
Plastik stomachs wrapped in steel
Hair falls in a dead breeze curtain
Trash can canterbury-hollywood boulevard
O u can count on it-richard hell tacked to the
Wall
Remember the plunger pit-in love with nothing
At all

Our beards are circuits to amplifier
All our bells have an elite ring
Rapacious gardens of female distinktion
Can you smell trouble-libraries of rubble
I don't wanna know-who gets the highest score
Thats when my poodle pukes-on the gallery
Floor

We did not fade from the noise meditation
We stopped abruptly while spinning down
Hair falls in a dead breeze curtain
A silent gesture-for princess pleasure
Here comes mary rat-trudi tacked to the wall
Take me back to disgraceland-in love with
Nothing at all
