Best + sexy what was it anyway
Jean-michel what was it anyway
Saw you there what was it anyway
Kneel right down what was it anyway
Guitar on the ground what was it anyway
Lost yr hand what was it anyway
Hipsters stand what was it anyway
Glitter tongue what was it anyway
Gave you a flower what was it anyway
Gave you the power what was it anyway
Saintly ghosts what was it anyway
Tingling down what was it anyway
Nevermind what was it anyway

Soot me over / feel me naked
Soot me over / feel me escape

Boys go to jupiter to get more stupider
Girls go to mars, become rock stars

Come on down down to the river
Come on down and jump right in
Come on down I dare you to win now
Come on down and down my friend
Come on down and jump in the river
Come on down and jump right in
