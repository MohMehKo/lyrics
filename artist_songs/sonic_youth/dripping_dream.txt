Single fold sick insert design in junk
Grocery bag sleeve all the colours drunk
Texts of confusion and joy
Pink plastic pressing for bratfink
That's right
he's gone
wrapped up
chiffon
Sealed tight
hung up
street mouth
sad pup
Shards of sweetshine of voice and flute
Street mouth decodes the bluesking dude
Girlfriends will love the way we clip
Our split release on the thrashman
On top
a drop
fake blood
fresh mud
They're gone
for good
except
this one
Howling scriptures to the mother earth
O mother Africa awake yr son
To all the mommas with the money eyes
This kind of love comes as no surprise
Caught shadow
in sex meadow
Little darlings describe the scene
Purring notions of the dripping dream
We've been searching for the cream dream wax
Lathe killers make the meters crack
Caught shadow
in sex meadow
Purring notions of the dripping dream
The kinda girls with the money eyes
Howling scriptures to the mother earth
O mother Africa awake yr sun
Caught shadow
in sex meadow
Little darlings describe the scene
To all the mommas with the money eyes
Purring notions of the dripping dream
This kinda love comes in any size
Sensation shaking us from sleep
Hey Ethiopia were free
The dripping dream in cream-o-wax
Disk drops from yr hand and it cracks
