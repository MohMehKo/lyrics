Eyeliner was so cheap
It was free it was easy to steal because no 
Sister would miss it really 
Why would anyone steal it anyway 

You can apply it with the same expertise 
As you have with yr guitar
Just a bit so no one 
Gets too in yr face

Hit the street and go look for Angela 
Licking Angela's thighs back and round and round
Black lined lashes is punk rock sex 
Without all the hangups
Hits are for squares 
And so is money

Burnt english muffin crunches nicely between teeth
With still a whole lotta future to go
Bags of records as currency 
For rent and cigs and electricity 
Shit and phone, prostitutes 
On Chrystie and Delancey 

Think I can afford sex 
In Sara Delano Roosevelt Park? 
Maybe I look like a rich kid 
Or at least some kid with a bit of coin 
They will take it 
I can't even imagine it

Nowhere to go but the back door
Hard boot kick to metal void
Cold beer stench
Speed plowed waitress
Some art rock types working our way
To ice cream and thin sheet glory
A smile on the jesus freak 
Hooked on our show

Burnished hearts blind to
Inevitable madness
Take care of the devil 
Treat him with embrace 
Alive with Mary Magdalene's heart 
Her eyes light the screen, a siren 
Breasts somewhat buttoned
Somewhat busting thru
Next town over and I land into
Exasperated non-finish
Deliver me into tour mode 

Fucking kids crashing thru the woods
Stream language, resilient nature
Ripping thru: stones, rocks
Fallen branch

The chattering skulls of adult nayspeak (grimace)
Dead orange alerts annoy the bedroom gate
The poems, like text-straps, soothe and protect 
And beautify the insect click

City noise, screeching car-things 
Grandmothers in fractured finery 
A perfect day to taste a dog's coat 
Puppy lust, n' luck 

Corrective licking strategies 
She motions for a light curious 
To the invasive fix
