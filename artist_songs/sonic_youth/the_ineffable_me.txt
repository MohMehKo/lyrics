Cant catch me 
I'm syntax free 
I'm preconceived 
Preternaturally 
I don't invest 
In what is best 
Your once and for all 
Means shit to me 
Hate translator 
Hate translator 
Hate translator 
You can't catch me 
Don't mistake her 
Don't misshape her 
You don't mutate her 
You can't get me 
The radical beacon 
The preverbal season 
The abstract poetics 
Immediate treason 
Do you remember 
Reductionist lie 
Fundamentalist 
Alibi 
Hate castrater 
Hate castrater 
Hate castrater 
Don't fuck with me 
Don't you break her 
And don't deflate her 
Don't outdate her 
Or you'll fuck with me 
Its a cushy job 
A pussy's job 
A cum junkie's job 
Makes my dick throb 
Feel...ineffable 
Cant catch me 
I'm syntax free 
I'm preconceived 
Prehistoricly 
Don't be alarmed 
Don't be alarmed 
Don't be alarmed 
Its only me 
Come back in my arms 
Back in my arms 
Back in my arms 
The ineffable me
