[Thurston]
Whoahooh!

I love you baby 'cause you're back in time - I love you today
Yr eyes are flashing like a magic sign - the sun comes out to play

I learned it all from you girl - I got it all from you
How to howl the moon yeah - and how to scratch yr dog
I do it every day - come back again tomorrow
You chased it all away

A dreaming beauty sleeping day and night - the sun around you
I love you baby yeah you're superfine - a-comin' down too
A purring whirring fuzzy lights of day - a-switching sunlight
I chase you kitten catch you every time - funny how it flies

I learned it all from you girl - I got it all from you
How to howl the moon yeah - and how to scratch yr dog
I do it every day - come back again tomorrow
You chase the life away

I hear you purring through a supersoul - a-puff in to it
A puss in leather yeah a prince in gold - a leather tale away

I learned it all from you girl - I got it all from you
How to howl the moon yeah - and how to scratch yr dog
I do it every day - come back again tomorrow
You chase the life away
