Today I 
Said goodbye 
To my conflicted goddess 
Her lush eyes 
Show surprise 
At how we could gather knowledge 
The painting has a dream 
Where shadow breaks the scene 
And the colors run off 
Blue is bashful 
Green is my goal 
Yellow girls are running backwards 
Until the nextime 
With six hits of sunshine 
The lights will blind up with blues in haiku 
The shadow has a dream 
Where painters look to sea 
The colors burn out 
Now I know where 
I once saw you 
Stepping into muddy water 
John's reflection 
Decried perfection 
Now you walk him through the gardren 
Waiting in the wings 
Painters shade their dreams 
With falling colors 
See me wave good 
Bye forever 
Happiness the goddess lover 
Hurry back re 
Member last time 
The hits of sunshine 
The hits of goldmine 
I'll see you back tonite 
Where painters love the light 
And yellow shadow girls 
Today I 
Say goodbye 
To my complicious goddess 
Her hushed eyes 
Show surprise 
And how we captured knowledge 
I'll see you back tonite 
Where shadows dream of light 
Let's slip on outside
