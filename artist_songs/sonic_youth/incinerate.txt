I ripped yr heart out from yr chest
Replaced it with a grenade blast

Incinerate [4x]

Firefighters hose me down
I don't care I'll burn out anyhow
It's 4 alarm girl nothing to see
Hear the sirens come for me
You dosed my soul with gasoline
You flicked a match into my brain

Incinerate [4x]

The firefighters are so nice
I remember you so cold as ice
Now flames are licking at yr feet
Sirens come to put me out of misery
You wave yr torch into my eyes
Flamethrower lover burning mind

Incinerate [8x]
