[Lee]
Stretch me to the point where I stop
Run ten thousand miles and then think of me
I think you know the place we should meet
Don't worry if it's dark and I'm late

Run me out a thin wire
Help me to kill this, love
I'll meet you tonite at the bottom of the well
Just feel around in the dark until you get the idea

I'm not moving doesn't mean I can't
Flame on in my head
My best friend sucked his wife's blood an shriveled up
He was mistaken for sane

We move and groove and cut loose from fear
We should kill time, we'll shut it down
I've got a pipeline straight to the heart of you
Opening in my head

Bright glass on a chair being wound around us
The toiling of idle hands
Dripping,
With guilt
A secret form of punishment
Axes thru skulls
Shadow of futility
Endless / revolt
The shining of light and shadows

Dividing each existance
No-one is right
Nothing is solid
Nothing can be held in my hands for long

Discontinuity
Sandy beaches
Bridges sinking into the sea
Beautiful confusion
You're a fading memory

We should kill time
