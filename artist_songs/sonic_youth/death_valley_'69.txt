Groooooahhh!

You're right

You're right

And now in the canyon
Out in the yonder
She started to holler

So I had to hit it

I got sand in my mouth
And you got sun in your eyes
Blind 
And you wanted to get there
But I couldn't go faster

So I started to hit it
So I started to hit it
I started to hit it

[both]

Coming down
Sadie, I love it
Now now now
Death valley '69

You're right
You're right
You're right

I was on the wrong track
We're deep in the valley
How deep in the gulley

She started to holler
I didn't wanna
I didn't wanna
I didn't wanna
I didn't wanna
But she started to holler

Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Deep in the valley
In the trunk of an old car
In the back of a chevvy

But you couldn't go faster

Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it

Coming down
Sadie, I love it
Now now now
Death valley '69
Death valley '69
Death valley '69
Death valley '69

[Lydia Lunch]

You were right

And now in the canyon
Way out in the yonder

You got sand in your mouth
I got sun in your eyes
Blinded

I wanted to get there

You couldn't go faster

Hit it

Ieieieioooooaoaoaieeih!
