One two, one two, one two titty
I know every nook and cranny in New York City
We're ciccone and that's enough
I'm the royal tuff titty and you gotta taste my love
Taste my love
Yeah
Meeeh
Come on everybody and rock with me
I am the one on the christmas tree
Now working at the word like a moving storm
Now walking up the stairs and cookin' up the (board?)
Trippin' everywhere I don't fucking care
Put on some dark eyes and waving goodbye
Yooo
