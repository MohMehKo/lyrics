Keep on runnin' in the dark 
Dude ranch dream is fallin' apart 
Stolen kisses let's pretend my friend 
You play sick and I will mend 
Let the action begin again my friend 
You be patient and I'll attend 

Let's rehearse let's do it again 
Dude ranch nurse yr brand new friend 

Let nurse give you a shot it's something to do 
Took my pulse 
Let nurse give you a shot it's something to do 
I could love you I could love you 

Deep sleep coming along 
Like a newborn colt you found 
You're wrapping around the gauze 
Dizzy reminder 
Ouch she found 

Let nurse give you a shot, don't slip too far 
I could love you 
I could have you 

You be cowboy and I'll allow 
Let me ride you 'til you fall 
Let's pretend there's nothing at all 
Nobody knows the shape I'm in 
Kiss me now it's just a sin 
Nobody knows the shape I'm in
