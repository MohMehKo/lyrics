Smile like a sun, back over time
Crazy fr you, pleasure is mine
I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?
I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?

You're coming thru, even it up
Going too far, try understand
I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?
I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?

Whisper kiss yr ear, I'll tell you what I fear
Whisper the kisses in yr ear, I'll tell you what I fear

Come on home, just ain't fair
Name of rock'n'roll, where love dies
Couldn't find a soul, tell it like it is
Deep down inside, drunken butterfly
I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?
I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?
I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?
I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?
