Blast id earth
Om immersed
Gold in cave
The blondes come first

I love the way you move
I hope its not too late
For me

Its too good
On this sea
Where the light
Is green
Where the light
Is green

Jagged brain
Slow refrain
We love the jams
And black runs free

I love the way you move
I hope its not too late
For me

Its too good
On this sea
Where the light
Is green
Where the light
Is green
