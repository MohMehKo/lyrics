[Thurston]
Insulation
In my circulation
I'm a mating rhythm
Sick with electricion
Nazi operation
Devestation

Wire up a radio
And I am a mating rhythm
Wire up the radio
Turn the terror and find my limit

Hot wire my heart
Hot wire my heart
Hot wire my heart

Like this

(I feel now?)
They're movin' in
Pull the zipper
It's sliding up
I don't have a reason
Honey for your best man

Wire up a radio
And I am a beating rhythm
Wire up for the radio
Turn the terror an'

Hot wire my heart
Hot wire my heart
Hot wire my heart

Like this

A kicking in the nightshifts
Greasing up/a teasing of my fingertips
I think you'll find us
Anybody's title??
Got my eyes on the controls
Turned on let's go

Wire up the radio
And I am a mating rhythm
Wire up for the radio
Turn the treble and fight my limit

Hot wire my heart
Hot wire my heart
Hot wire my heart
