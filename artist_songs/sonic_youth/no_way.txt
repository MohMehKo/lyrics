Sweet temptation came today
Time for angels to kneel and pray
I saw you hangin with the devil
Evil nature frozen grave
Renounce yr lies sweet succubi-oh no
I don't care I don't wanna hear it
Cuz I'm not talkin to you no more
And I'm never gonna shadow yr door-
No way

U know u hrt me once
And you know ull never hurt me again
Cuz I'm sick of all yr games
You can't trick my love w/sin
Sinners lie I will never die-I said no
I don't care I don't wanna hear it
Cuz I'm not talking to you no more
And I'm never gonna shadow yr door-
No way

Sweet temptation came today
Time for angels to kneel and pray
Yr black wings r bound in chains
As I swoop into yr grave
Werewolf kommandos poison tongue-I said no
I don't care I don't wanna hear it
Cuz I'm not talkin to you no more
And I'm never gonna shadow yr door-
No way
