[Kim]
Always cost a pair of hose - spaces pressed together rose
Arms around each others back - you know that I liked you Jack
And all the other boys who pose - a silent dance in the woods
In the suburb light is shown - another can of Coca Cola
Don't you ever call me Mom - freckled dancing in the plan 
And air so thin it weighs a ton - you can see as far as fun
You're nothing but a history - a second here and then you're gone
Quicksand, quicksand all around - turn the corner just beyond
The shadows move and change the groove - and something tells me not to brood
Turning room and that's a show - you're walking through my heart once more
Don't forget to close the door - I'm not certain of what you found
All the men want a charming whore - like a crown fortunes
Sunny skies and angels bleed - falling down upon my knees
That wasn't how it's supposed to be - clear blue eyes, justice tries
The wind is busy blowing dizzy - you're dreams were shot like a star
Exploding in a mind somewhere - doing something on a dare
Pulling a trigger like breathing air - a sunkissed boy that gave no thought
To what he'd made while others sake

Ocean spreads a candle sand - it's dripping in my hand, you're dead
Little brother reminding me - the moments tick forever true
You can see as far as him - don't you know the shape I'm in
You're walking through my heart once more - don't forget to close the door
