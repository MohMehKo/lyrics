Skimmin' the tops of tall trees 
Through the clear light of free speech 
A sudden memory disease 
Claims the air all around me 

I'm gettin' lost in the slipstream 
Maybe relive the same dream 
Of comin' in from the cold 
And losin' half of my soul 

Memory disease 
Across United States 

That I had told the truth 
Feel so high 
Architectural 
I look to the skies 
To see our bodies 
They were rising up 
Out of the paper cup 

A sea change is due 
I don't seem to (?) you 
Touchdown on the new mason-dixon 
Line-up map was ripped and torn 
Jilted frame with all hope gone 
And I don't mind if you sing a differnet song 
Sing a different song 
Just as long as you sing 
Sing along 

It's later than it seems [x3]
Time everyone came down (?) 
It's what you didn't say it's what you didn't say 
Don't wanna be a slave 
It's what you didn't

Skimmin' the tops of tall trees 
Through the clear light of free speech 
I'm comin' in for a landing 
I've got a soul (sole?) understanding 
It all comes down to a word 
It's just like nothin' I heard 
Over the rainbow in time 
Will be one hell of a climb 
Eye lights bright 
The lights sweep high clear sky 
Sky 
Reminiscent 
Of money in your eye 
Unwind 

I don't mind if you sing a different song 
Sing a different song 
Just as long as you sing 
Sing along 
It's later than it seems 
It's later than it seems 
It's later than it seems 

New ears are listening 
It's what you didn't say 
It's what you didn't say 
Don't wanna be a slave 
It's what you didn't say 
Nothing to give away
