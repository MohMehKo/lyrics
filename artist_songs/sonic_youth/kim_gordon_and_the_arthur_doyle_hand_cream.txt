[Kim]
Yr bounce to the ounce makes us wanna pounce
Yr just being totally perfect
On Larry King you said you were tired
Time to put to bed yr competitive edge
They say you can't say no to Brahma
Now you don't have to try so hard
The label says you don't have to wear less clothes
It's time to take a bubble bath

[Chorus:]
Hey hey little baby breakdown
Button up baby you come undone
Hey hey little baby get down
Before you fall and hurt someone

You say you need privacy
Broken glass everywhere
Maybe you need an emo boy
No underwear on the director's chair
You are seemingly unconscious 
Of what yr body is doing
Like Miss Monroe yr head don't know
Exactly what yr body's doing

[Chorus]

On TV you're soft and whispery 
Delicate like angel food cake
They say if you press too hard on it
It will squish into a dense ball 
It will lose its fluffiness
That's what you get when you use a box mix
Can you get some satisfaction
How much are you willing to pay?

[Chorus]

What's yr gut feeling about the new deal
How's the label gonna remake you?
How was yr date with Eminem
Did he bake you and then forsake you
Is innocence gonna still overtake you
Like Arthur Doyle they can't fake you
Oh Mariah you are endless
Like the wind, you feel defenseless

[Chorus]
