[Thurston]
Like girl come walkin' thru the cornfield
Like blue vibration thru the sea
I know I'd love her to breathe, again
Like cubes are talkin' her down

I've been a wasted day
Like spinning round a saint
Like colored wild sign
Theresa talkin' in the rain

Like girl be growin' thru town
Windows are thoughts in the stain
I know I'd love her to stay
Whispering signs are agreeing

Like talkin' golden terrain
Like thrivin' dark in the saint
A cat in gold goes along
Theresa's sound for the king
