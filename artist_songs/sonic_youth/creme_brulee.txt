Aaaaaaaaaaoooow
Whoooow
Ha
Ha

Riding down the road it nearly struck me blind
You and me are burning in the summertime

Let's go find some shady ground
Gotta get rid of that king hell throng
You and me are burning in the summertime
You and me are burning in the summertime

Scrape, scrape, scrapin' melted cheese
Say I love you, later please
You and me are burning in the summertime
You and me are burning in the summertime

Dark spots floating in front of my eyes
Mum said she turned it and squattin' flies
You and me are burning in the summertime
You and me are burning in the summertime

Last night I dreamed I kissed Neil Young
If I was a boy I guess it would be fun
You and me are burning in the summertime
You and me are burning in the summertime

Don't you know a city where the horses grow?
Green malls hanging chillin' crows
You and me are burning in the summertime
You and me are burning in the summertime

I said it before and I'll say it again:
"I'm so happy we're just friends"
