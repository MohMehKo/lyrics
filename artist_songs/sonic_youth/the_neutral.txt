He's not a dreamer or a schemer,
Running away from me
He's not a singer, an entertainer
With no follow thru
He's not a poet or a mystic
With his cgarette unglued
He just neutral, and he's weary
Not even brand new.

It's a perfect sin
Close yr eyes and loose the rest
It's a perfect sin
Close yr mind and feel the best

Everyone has a headache
Imprecise , hard to cure
Got a shake it, what ails you
The lines are a blur
Is it a pain in her heart
Dark and gray from the start
You won't seduce me, or attract
Just cause yr a stray

It's a perfect sin
Close yr eyes and loose the rest
It's a perfect sin
Close yr mind and feel the best

Why won't you tell me what's inside yr head
Why won't you show me yr secret bed, secret bed?

He's not a dreamer or a schemer
Running away from you
He's not a singer, an entertainer
With no follow thru
He's not a poet or a mystic
With his cigarette unglued
He 's not a cowboy or a loner with nothing to do
He's neutral yeah he's weary,
Not even brand
He's neutral yea he's weary
And he's so in love with you.
