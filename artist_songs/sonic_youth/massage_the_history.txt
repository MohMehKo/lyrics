Oil dripping on my head
Let's go back to bed
Bring you back to me
Bring you back to me

Oil dripping on my head
Bring you back
From the dead
From the dead
Here's wishing you were here with me
Here's wishing we could massage
History, history
I'm witness to what you do
Anything that you feel
In between, in between
You and me
Bound at sea
Floating on debris
Yr so close, close to me
Yr so close, close to me

Oil dripping on my head
Let's go back to bed
Bring you back
Bring you back
From the dead
From the dead
Wishing you were here by me
Wishing you were here
Let's massage history
All the money's gone
All the money's gone
Funny it was never here
It was never here
Here's a song
Here's a song
To massage along
History along
Come with me
To the other side
Not everyone makes it out alive
Come with me
To the other side not everyone makes it out
Alive
I want you to suck my neck...

Suck
