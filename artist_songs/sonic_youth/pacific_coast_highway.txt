Come on get in the car
Lets go for a ride somewhere
I won't hurt you
As much as you hurt me
Let me take you there
Before the sun goes down
Come on give me your love
Comon baby all you have
I wanna take your breathe away
Comon baby
Just like that, you say
You make me feel so crazy
Comon get in the car
Lets go for a ride somewhere
I won't hurt you
You make me feel so crazy
