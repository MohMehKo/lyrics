"Take my hand" he said to me
Follow now or you'll be damned
Let's go to the other side
Let's go to the other side
Great balls of simplicity
Great balls of simplicity
Brother James gave em to me
Brother James gave em to me
I don't need em anymore
Don't go knockin' at my door
I don't need em anymore
Don't go knockin' at my door

Take my hand, you might as well
We're going straight to hell
I don't wanna hang around
Won't you stick yr head in the ground
