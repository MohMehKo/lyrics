Sing yr children 
Yr children song 
Sing yr love child 
Love is on 
See thru child eyes 
Eyes are old 
And old is magic growing 
See the child lights 
Spinning gold 
Everyday girl 
They blow away 
Leaves falling to the water 
Wildflowers 
For you today 
Sing yr birthday 
Yr birthday blues 
Sing yr wild light 
Wildflowers bloom 
They will not forget you 
And down/they go 
To sleep/so slow 
Away/they grow 
They go 
I wait/i wait all day 
Sing yr love child 
Love is on 
Sing yr child lights 
Sing yr child lights 
Lights are gold 
Sing yr child life 
Wildflower soul
