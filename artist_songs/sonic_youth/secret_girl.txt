My mother used to say
'you're the boy that can enjoy invisibility'
I'm the boy that can enjoy invisibility
Close your eyes make a wish
Cross yourself
See yourself
Feel yourself
Scream once more
Move yourself
Across the floor
Burn inside
Between two walls
The advertisements say
The pleasure's ever lasting
Come an' touch me
The advertisements say
The pleasure's ever lasting
Must be dead and gone to heaven
Come and touch me here
So I know
That I'm
Not there
