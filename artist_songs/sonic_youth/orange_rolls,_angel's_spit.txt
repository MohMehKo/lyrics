She got you, got you good - didn't have a chance
Pretty lady put you in - wear hat master ends (?)
Oh baby don't you know - you're livin' on the death
You better stay away - if you wanna live

Lalalalalalalalalaaaaaah
Lalalalalalalalalaaaaaah

Every time you turn around she is lookin' up at you and down below
Oooh - sugar pie
Mmm - come on
Chocolate spot

She gotta gun and all - don't you even know
She looks into your eyes - angels wanna go (?)
She takes it on the stride - leap through mind again (?)
Don't worry you are fine - living with the mess

Lalalalalalalalalaaaaaah
Lalalalalalalalalaaaaaah

Every time you turn around she is lookin' up at you and down below
Ooh - sugar pudding
Candy tic
Orange rolls - angel's spit

Boy she's got you got you good - don't you even try?
Come on if you could - you would surely die
You take it towards your mouth - you don't even know
Come on sugar tic - you are gonna go

Lalalalalalalalalaaaaaah
Lalalalalalalalalaaaaaah

Every time you turn around she is lookin' up at you and down below
Cool dye - chocolate spot
Check her out - don't you know 
Deep in my heart - saying g'bye (?)
