If I could give you anything
I would give you a kick
You'd rather have a dollar 
Than a hug from your sis

You really fucked up this time
Your old lady's really pissed
She's not just laughing
She's polishing her fist

If you could give me anything
Would you consider a fist?
Don't give me yr soul
It's caught is an abyss

Here's a pack of ciggies
Fresh from the wonder lips
A dream, a wish, a heart's desires
Cinderella is a kiss

A cold is gonna take you
And freeze away your tears
Ome a little closer honey
You can be so near

Mind your heart aside you (?)
Really got no sense of time (?)
Ninety-nine inside you (?)
That I'm scared if you were cryin'

If I could give you anything
I would give you a kick
You'd rather have a dollar
Than a hug from your sis

A cold is gonna take you
And freeze away your tears
Come a little closer honey
We can be so near
