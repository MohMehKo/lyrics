She scans the room
For a star to consume
When eye contact is made
I suggest son you fix yr grave

[Chorus:]
Its lights out for you
Lights out for you
Theres not a hell of a lot you can do
Its lights out for you

He rolls his eyes
At the thought of paradise
But when he makes that insect sound
Then its time girl for you to leave town

[Chorus]

She scans the room
For a star to consume
When eye contact is made
I suggest son you fix yr grave

[Chorus]
