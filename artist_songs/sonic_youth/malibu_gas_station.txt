Malibu gas station
Pumps up the nation
A tough cross to bear
Oops no underwear

Com' on do it
You gotta use it
That a girl
Don't you blow it
Com' on move me
Turn me on now
It will make make you feel so good, yeah

I took the stage to show you
So long ago now
My mind is hazy
Just a little crazy

Com' on do it
You gotta use it
That a girl
Don't you blow it
Com' on move me
Turn me on now
Roll me over
It will make you-

Everybody down, everybody dark,
Crawling on the ground

I can't move faster
My face is plaster
The breasts are bangin
Abdominal master

Com' on do it
[Repeat chorus etc]

Everybody down, everybody dark, crawling on the ground
Movin in the waves, moving in the sand,
Bumping on the ground
Grinding in the water, grinding in the water, feel
The undertow, feel the undertow, whats yrs is
Mine, whats yrs is mine, feel the undertow, oh
Yeah pulling down, pull me down,
In the undertow french kiss, french kiss now

Malibu gas station
On face the nation
California magik
A tan so tragique
