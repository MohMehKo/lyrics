Come on down, down to the river
Come on down I want to feel you shiver
Dark on the edges, golden on top
Floatin down the river
Yr so hot
Oh oh oh oh oh ooh
[repeat]

Come on down, down to the river
Come on down I want to feel you shiver
The sight of death is sure to deliver,
Come on down I want to hear you quiver
Oh oh ooh
Corpses' drapery
Rusting, sliding, sliding,
Sliding
Endless
