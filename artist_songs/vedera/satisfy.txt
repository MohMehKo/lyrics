If there was a way to try and make it back
Back to where we started from
Could I find a way to try and make you stay?
Would I know what could be done?

I don't wanna deny my heart its chance to feel
I don't wanna deny my soul something real

Is there anything left in this world
That will satisfy me?
Is there anything left in this world
That will satisfy you tonight?

We were sailing on, I could see the world below
Never thought of coming down
Expectations fell, it seemed as though our will
Was no match for the trouble found

I don't wanna deny my heart its chance to feel
I don't wanna deny my soul something real

Is there anything left in this world
That will satisfy me?
Is there anything left in this world
That will satisfy you tonight?

So take my hand and I won't look back
Though I've lived tossed along these waves
I will stay

Is there anything left in this world
That will satisfy me?
Is there anything left in this world
That will satisfy me?

Is there anything left in this world
That will satisfy you?
Is there anything left in this world
That will satisfy me tonight?
