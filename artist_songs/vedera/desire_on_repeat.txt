it's all the same
sex in the air
your promises all the same
you'll be the one who will always care
but how can you promise the world
how can you promise your heart when it's always searching
but i'm just like you
i don't want to deny my heart its chance to feel
i don't want to deny my soul something real
is there anything else in this world that can satisfy me
do you really love him they'll say
your second chances are scribbled in the rules
but i think the consequence is just
something more feels so exciting
and this black romance is so enticing
this desire is worth the fighting
but is it worth deciding that i am just like you
and it keeps repeating
and we keep believing
disrupt the part of me that needs some space
repeat that look i see in your face
remid me of truth, remind me of the reason of existence
