your eyes are nothing i've looked deep knowing i was safe
and this memory will never be erased
you put me in my place no more
i would have liked a call
outside of you calling out my faults
i would have liked to settle this once and for all
would you have me crawl
and this memory, it will never fade
you can cry in this bed alone
i won't cry with you anymore
you can lay in this grave you made
i won't lie with you anymore
