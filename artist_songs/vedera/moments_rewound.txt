When I'm lost without a word to say
When I'm not the most intriguing
Will you stay?
When I've called just to hear you say hi
Will you find me too needy and walk away?

And I know these are silly questions to ask you
'Cause you've proven to love me far beyond my faults
And I'll hold on to every conversation if it could be our last

'Cause when you're not breathing
I beg for one more breath with you
When you're silent
I hang on to every word
And there are no regrets with this love

Rewind to any moment you like
Sit back, remember
I will always sit back with you

Oh how cool you wished to be
We were both so nervous
But at peace
And the same time knowing this was right

The time I moved in closely for what you weren't expecting
Think on this
But don't miss
Don't long for the past
Long for what comes next

'Cause when you're not breathing
I beg for one more breath with you
And when you're silent
I hang on to every word
And there are no regrets with this love
No~o

Come away with life
Come away with love
With something better

'Cause when you're not breathing
I beg for one more breath with you
And when you're silent
I hang on to every word
And there are no regrets with this love
No
