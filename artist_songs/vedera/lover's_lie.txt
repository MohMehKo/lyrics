where'd you go
the leaves they move too fast
i was lost looking for your face
did you go to catch the lovers lie
or to move the stars and put them in place
is there ever a dream of mine you haven't heard
i'll keep running ahead of the race
to hope i put a sparkle in your eye
did you know when you move i breathe
i'd take blind destiny over empty space
as my friends slowly fade into ghosts
i hold on tighter, and struggle for demands
i'll keep running ahead of the race
until i put a sparkle in your eye
