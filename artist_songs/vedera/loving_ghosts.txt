I don't know how long I've been here
the days all run together
You're gone but you won't disappear
Traces of you will last forever
It feels like...
If I hold my breath you'll walk in any second
and tell me it was all a mistake, cant believe that you left and
It haunts me to hold you this close
but hurts me more to let go
That's why I'm still loving ghosts
They say I should get on with my life
but I can't even get up
I'd rather believe in this beautiful lie
than admit you're really gone forever

Every sense is screaming
every hair stands on my skin
every room I feel it. You are here!
Baby I'm not seeing, but I'm still believing 
My heartbreak a chance worth taking
so on this floor I'll still be waiting

and OH...I feel you this close now
....I'm still loving ghosts now
