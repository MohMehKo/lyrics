In the night I have traveled
All alone just to see
Where I left all the memories
I had grown to count as me

Through the days though uncertain
I can live secretly
Just for you, just for you
Just for you

And I strain to see
Will it ever be you and me?

Singing, oh, oh
We sing, oh, oh

It was cold on the last day
I was trying not to see
In a place so familiar
Yet resisting all of me

I am one, I am only
Who I hope that I can be
All for you, all for you
All for you

And I strain to see
Will it ever be you and me?

Singing, oh, oh
We sing, oh, oh
Singing, oh, oh
We sing, oh, oh

If you could only see how good
I could be in your arms tonight
If you could only see how good
We could be moving on

We sing, oh, oh
We sing, oh, oh
We sing, oh, oh
We sing, oh, oh

We sing, oh, oh
We sing, oh, oh
We sing, oh, oh
We sing, oh, oh

We sing, oh, oh
We sing, oh, oh
