Who is this darkness?
Who is this lucid dreamer?
Why do I love the way this distance feels?
It's coiled up independence

I want so much to run
Carry me over all this distance, my dear
Trade this fear
Carry me over all

What part of my heart enters into your secrets?
And where is the key to cherish you?
I want to repay all the debt
Insecurities ran up
My peaceful surrender I do not own

I want so much to run
Carry me over all this distance, my dear
Trade this fear
Carry me over all this distance, my dear
Dear, oh

Was I dreaming when I called you the loveliest?
Was I only hoping my pride would quiet itself?
And everything is quiet
Everything's so quiet

I want so much to run
Carry me over all this distance, my dear
Trade this fear
Carry me over all this distance, my dear

Call the guards
Call the authorities
And lock this tension up
Call the guards before my heart
It runs away again
