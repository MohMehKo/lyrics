I've been running along these spaces all alone
Trying to find a place I feel that I belong
You don't seem to notice me
You don't seem to notice me

You've got money and power
To hold your position down
But all this money and power
Is showing me the ground
I can't see anymore, I can't see anymore

Watch you go

Down, I can see you running
Look around, look around
There is no one following
Now what're you gonna do solo?
Look around, look around

Down, I can see you running
Look around, look around
There is no one following
Now what're you gonna do solo?
Look around, look around

I've been thinking that I can find a better way
Outside of all the empty hopes and words you say
You can't breathe when you're alone
You can't breathe when you're alone

Watch you go

Down, I can see you running
Look around, look around
There is no one following
Now what're you gonna do solo?
Look around, look around

Down, I can see you running
Look around, look around
There is no one following
Now what're you gonna do solo?
Look around, look around

Where'd the people go who told you
All the pretty things, your ego full?
What's the matter now?
I see you falling, falling, falling, falling

Where'd the people go who told you
All the easy words not what they should?
What's the matter now?
I see you falling, falling, falling, falling

Down, I can see you running
Look around, there is no one following
Now what're you gonna do solo?
Look around, look around

Down, I can see you running
Look around, look around
There is no one following
Now what're you gonna do solo?
Look around, look around
