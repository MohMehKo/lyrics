Here in a box I hide the letters
Written, postmarked with your name
Secrets I wish I could only share
With a heart that feels, feels the same

And here we fall to pieces
In front of each other but we know
Somehow we're greater
Than our lonely fears

Here's where the notes were torn and crumbled
Before feelings could reach the page
Try to replace some sober thought
From emotion, fists held up with rage

And here we fall to pieces
In front of each other but we know
Somehow we're so much greater
Than

Here we fall to pieces
In front of each other but we know
Somehow we're greater
Than our lonely fears

Though I'm a simple mind, I know
I can see the picture drawn out here
You are the reason I have found
To keep believing in these years

And though the road is long
The trying keeps us holding on this way
And make no mistake, this is love
Love, love, love, this is love, love

And here we fall to pieces
In front of each other but we know
Somehow we're so much greater
Than

Here we fall to pieces
In front of each other but we know
Somehow we're greater
Than our lonely fears
