does she linger in the air
that follows you home each day
do you ever stop and stare at yourself
for traces of her
can a picture bring some comfort
where a song melody leaves off
is she silently rocking you to sleep
'cause i hope and i pray
i'll see a bit of that light
in my world today
it would be an injustice not to see
that kind of love live on
what kept your eyes up
kept your world from falling
darkness chokes, but you found a way out
may i say your words are insight
something unique
hold on my friend she's rocking you out of here
