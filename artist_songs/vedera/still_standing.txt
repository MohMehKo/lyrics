They're building hate today.
I see it in the eyes of every passing gaze.
They're calling your name today.
You've won, congratulations.
Say what you're suppose to say.
Be safe. Make everyone feel comfortable.

Call me out and let me breathe again.
Call me out and let me see it again.

And breathe into me the air you say you're not polluting.
And flatter me: tell me I am beautiful.
That i'm the only one you care for.
And make me believe that all your good intentions were heartsent.
All the wrong you've done, still I'll be screaming.

Call me out and let me breathe again.
Call me out and let me see it again.

You don't know all the wrong you've done, and we're still standing.
We will cast our faults and then we are free.
We will not fall.

When you call us out, giving us freedom again.
Won't you call us out, giving us freedom again.
