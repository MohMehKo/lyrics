It's on this road that I'm drawn back to you
As the miles remember me as I go
It's in the silence of a night's dream
That I recall the words of devotion we spoke

And I can't remember where our bodies roamed
I can't remember all alone
How our love got lost out in the cold

But you're the only song I hear
In this great wandering mess of my years
You're the only one I know
Who brings me back to the middle

You're the only song I hear
In this great wandering mess of my years
You're the only one I know
Who brings me back to the middle

I separated all I thought I knew
In a pile of books collapsed upon my floor
I memorized the words in code and true
But I can't carry them with me no more

And I can't remember where our bodies roamed
I can't remember all alone
How our love got lost out in the cold

But you're the only song I hear
In this great wandering mess of my years
You're the only one I know
Who brings me back to the middle

You're the only song I hear
In this great wandering mess of my years
You're the only one I know
Who brings me back to the middle

Don't tell me you've been swept away
I can't believe it about you
I won't believe it about you, no

Don't tell me you've been swept away
I can't believe it about you
I won't believe it about you

'Cause you're the only song I hear
In this great wandering mess of my years
You're the only one I know
Who brings me back to the middle

You're the only song I hear
In this great wandering mess of my years
You're the only one I know
Who brings me back to the middle

And you will draw me near
When the sky opens and we appear
You'll bring me once again
Back to the middle
