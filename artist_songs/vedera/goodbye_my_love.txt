What do you see when you close your eyes?
Do you watch all your dreams go by?
I'll tell you what I see.

You're an uncut diamond,
You're the rarest star;
A lone bird dying to fly so far;
A beautiful mystery.
That's what you are.
Such a beautiful mystery.

So, baby go on and live your life.
I can't hold on and you're burning alive.
Don't let all your dreams just pass you by,
This is your time.

Even though we know that it's bittersweet,
Go and find the freedom that you need.
Even if it takes you away from me,
I know it's right.
So goodbye my love.
Yeah goodbye my love.

Like a violent storm on a quiet day,
Your heart is torn between go and stay.
I know that you love me,
But get on your way.
Yeah I know that you love me.

So baby go on and live your life.
I can't hold on and you're burning alive.
Don't let all your dreams just pass you by,
This is your time.

Even though we know that it's bittersweet,
Go and find the freedom that you need.
Even if it takes you away from me,
I know it's right.

And don't second guess yourself.
Yeah you know what you need.
Don't waste your moment worrying about me.

So goodbye my love.
Yeah goodbye my love.

Baby go on and live your life.
I can't hold on and you're burning alive.
Don't let all your dreams pass you by.
This is your time.

Even though we know that it's bittersweet.
Go and find the freedom that you need.
Even if it takes you away from me,
I know it's right.

You're an uncut diamond,
You're the rarest star;
A lone bird dying to fly so far.
Oh goodbye my love.
Goodbye my love.
