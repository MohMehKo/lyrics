You, you should've left me a long time ago
And you, you should've seen how scared I was
But you, you chose to stick around in spite of me
When I let the night take the day

And my friends the tiny glimpses
Of something different, something free
Moved away and moved along the scene
But just remember

If you go, well, I'm going with you
If you know, if you know me at all
If you go, well, I'm going with you
If you know, if you know me at all

You, you always take it slowly day by day
And you, you're never turning around
And you, you're always bringing me direction
And I know I'm coming home today

But baby, don't you know me?
I wouldn't give up, oh so soon
You'll see me fighting all those bitter parts
But just remember

If you go, well, I'm going with you
If you know, if you know me at all
If you go, well, I'm going with you
If you know, if you know me at all

Take it slow, we can move away
It doesn't matter what they say
Slow, we can move away
It doesn't matter what they say

Slow, we can move away
It doesn't matter what they say
Slow, we can move away
'Cause all that matters

If you go, well, I'm going with you
If you know, if you know me at all
If you go, well, I'm going with you
If you know, if you know me at all

When I say these words I mean them
And I will be your home again
