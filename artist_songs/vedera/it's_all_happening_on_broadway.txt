if you lay me down in this mess will i remember your name
when you come back calling for me like you said you would
do i trust your breath will sustain you in all your long hours
do i love your weakness enough to see it as my strength
do you come back to me
when everyone else has failed you
i am no more flattered by your wandering eyes
than i am by your softly broken lies
oh, the air is thick with betrayal
we search for devotion and wind up settling for emotion
you don't make me want to dance with you
you make me wanna, you make me wanna
make me wanna run and find something true
something true, someone like you
