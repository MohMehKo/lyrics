my eyes they never sleep
my eyes they torture me
my heart it falls so fast, but it looks back
my knees are getting weaker each passing day
with each word of disapproval my backbone falters
could this be my ticket out of here
could this be the one i'm dreaming of
could this be redemption soon
i need redemption soon
believe me when i say
i'm trying to make it just like you
could you show some grace
fall back into my spell
into my hell
you don't even know where i come from anymore
it used to be so easy
your provision doesn't even fall on my land anymore
conversation weakens in your eyes
