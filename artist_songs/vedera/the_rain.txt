Take a walk with me, love
You say you can't get enough
Well you won't till you open your door
And you give some more to me

And the silence in your steps
As you tip-toe around the rest
Makes me want to pull you in
And kiss you, my friend, and your silly games

And I'm not tired
I could chase you around
And debate you here again and again
So tell me lies if you want to
I can take it, I won't be afraid
'Cause I am the rain

The rain is gentle some days
It can clean off the mess that Winter made
The rain can wash all the years of doubt
And the tears that were shed
So just look up please
Shine a little bit of hope to me, oh
Let me know there's a season for all
And a season to call you my love

And throw me off with your pride
It's okay, I won't hide here again and again
I'll tell you there's no mistaking
The reason that I'm not afraid
'Cause I am the rain

The rain will wash us clean
And I know the rain will wash us clean
And when it does, I'll be right beside you
Holding on, holding on
The rain will wash us clean
And I know the rain will wash us clean
And when it does, I'll be right beside you
Holding on, holding on
