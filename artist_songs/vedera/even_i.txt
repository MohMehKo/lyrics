I don't wanna notice
I don't wanna see
Even I don't give up
Even I won't give up

You're breaking the surface
So what's left of me?
Tell me when is enough
Tell me I should give up

It's not the way you move
It's your words
Though they soothe
They're not telling the truth

Didn't I know you?
Didn't I try to carry on
While just believing in you?

Didn't I give up everything?
Tell me now if there's
A reason for anything

My heart it was open
You stepped through the door
It is tearing me up
Giving in, giving up

Left here always hoping
One day there'd be more
Even I don't give up
But tell me when is enough

I see the strings you pull
I'm not blind
And I'm not fooled
Well, you know it's true

Didn't I know you?
Didn't I try to carry on
While just believing in you?

Didn't I give up everything?
Tell me now if there's
A reason for anything

And here we are one glance away
I wanted you, you couldn't stay
Every part of me
Still reaching out, reaching in

And will I be here till the day
You've found another
To back away from?
I won't make the same mistake again, no

Didn't I know you?
Didn't I try to carry on
While just believing in you?

Didn't I give up everything?
Tell me now if there's
A reason for anything

Didn't I know you?
Didn't I try to carry on
While just believing in you?

Didn't I give up everything?
Tell me now if there's
A reason for anything

'Cause even I don't give up
Even I don't give up
Even I don't give up
Even I don't give up

I don't wanna notice
I don't wanna see
Even I don't give up
Even I won't give up
