No time for haters,
I see you later
Try to put up barriers
But I never get through the bitchy fake girls
I'm lying to them yeah, I'm lying to them yeah

When they're screaming out your name, everyone in the crowd
You know that you made it
Like a king on a throne, baby, you wear the crown

That's when you know that you made it (oh, oh, oh)
You know that you made it (oh, oh, oh)
You know that you made it (oh, oh, oh)
You know that you made it (oh, oh, oh)

When the moments try to pull you down-down
Cause they're jealous, you know
Keep you're head up to the heavens now-now
They're just jealous, you know

Never forget all those who held me down
But them sharksâ€”they left me to drown
Stronger than ever I'm holding my brow
Who's laughing now, yeah, who's laughing now

When they're screaming out your name, everyone in the crowd
You know that you made it
Like a king on a throne, baby, you wear the crown

That's when you know that you made it (oh, oh, oh)
You know that you made it (oh, oh, oh)
You know that you made it (oh, oh, oh)
You know that you made it (oh, oh, oh)
