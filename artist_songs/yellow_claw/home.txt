Take me home
While we're young in lives we're living
Take me home
Choose before the night is through
I don't care
When you wanna keep the feelings
As long as I get to stay while you do
Take me home with you
Take me home with you
Take me home with you
Take me home with you

Tell me a story
Make up the pieces
Tell me what you want me to do
Moving closer
I'm sick of the distance
Tell me what you want me to do

Cause I'm here for you
Cause I'm here for you
Cause I'm here for you
Cause I'm here for you

Love me like you never really wanna know my name
Everybody always thinks that they don't play these games
Cause you wanna take me home
And you wanna feel my soul
Cause we wanna, cause we wanna get to know
Feel my soul
And you feel my soul
And you feel my soul
And you feel my soul
And you

Tell me a story
Make up the pieces
Tell me what you want me to do
Moving closer
I'm sick of the distance
Tell me what you want me to do

Cause I'm here for you
Cause I'm here for you
Cause I'm here for you
Cause I'm here for you
