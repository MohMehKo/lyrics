[Gia Koka:]
You got me not falling at all
I guess I knew was never yours
But I never heard about them all, no
You could've told me way before
One in a million, I was more
I wouldn't never let go
So you are quickly moving on 'cause
If you could've told me way before

But I'm good without you
Keep looking but I'll never go back, no
I was better but without your love
I'm good without you
And I'm not saying goodbye, baby, no
I was better but without your love

Good
But I'm good
But I'm
I was better but without your love

Tell me you know where do I go
When the said all that calls me home
Sometimes I wonder if we knew at all
The way we knew it right before
I see in your eyes, you hold back
You don't even tell it's the same
Sometimes I wonder if we all done
Would you be drowning in my love?

But I'm good, ooh ooh ooh, without you, ooh ooh ooh
I can't, I can't ever go back, no
I was better but without your love, I'm

Good
But I'm good
I'm
I was better but without your love

I'm good, without you
But I'm good, without you
But I'm good, without you
But I'm good, without you
