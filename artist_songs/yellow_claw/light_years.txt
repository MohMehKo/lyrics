Electric nights, like fireflies
Time is frozen
Velvet skies, like lightning vibes
We be floating

'Cause when you touch me
I swear I can't speak
I'm out of body
There ain't no coming back
And when you touch me
It's what my heart needs
And we can run free
I know that

We can be light years away
I know I can find you
We can be light years away
I know we can shine through

Anywhere
Anywhere
Anywhere
I know I can find you
Anywhere
Anywhere
Anywhere
I know we can shine through

(Yellow motherfucking Claw)

Worlds apart, we're shooting stars
Skies are open
A ray of sparks, our beating hearts
Throw us in motion

'Cause when you touch me
I swear I can't speak
I'm out of body
There ain't no coming back
And when you touch me
It's what my heart needs
And we can run free
I know that

We can be light years away
I know I can find you
We can be light years away
I know we can shine through

Anywhere
Anywhere
Anywhere
I know I can find you
Anywhere
Anywhere
Anywhere
I know we can shine through

(Yellow motherfucking Claw)
