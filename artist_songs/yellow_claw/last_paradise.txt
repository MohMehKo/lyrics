We started as friends and now we're two lovers, since then, it still feels new
How can it be that you always know how to find the best in me?
Memories of walking by your door, never saw you like this before
So take your hands off your heart and hold me tight

I never told you seventy times
I'll tell you again, cause you think that I lie
But I keep falling when I look in your eyes
When I look in your eyes
Yeah, I think I love you a little bit more
The way that you kiss me and I'm all yours
I take you back in when you open your eyes
When you open your eyes
You're my last paradise

Are we mad? It's still a mystery
Thinking 'bout who, our history
No, no days go by without you here
Nowhere else I'd rather be

I never told you seventy times
I'll tell you again, cause you think that I lie
But I keep falling when I look in your eyes
When I look in your eyes
Yeah, I think I love you a little bit more
The way that you kiss me and I'm all yours
I take you back in when you open your eyes
When you open your eyes
You're my last paradise
