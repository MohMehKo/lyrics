Let's not let the seconds go to waste, waste, waste
Let's get lost together on the streets, streets, streets
We can trip all night, hanging like we're satellites
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Let's not let the seconds go to waste, waste, waste

Til we wake up, we play all, we rollin' them dice
We're living on the edge, yeah, cause we 'bout that life
Say we wake up, we play all, we rollin' them dice
We're living on the edge, yeah, we're living on the edge, yeah

We get far, without y'all, than ever
Don't look down, we're in this together
Do walk down, without fall, whatever
We get far, we're higher than ever
Higher than ever
We get far, we're higher than ever

We get far, we're higher than ever
Higher than ever

We can do whatever in the dark
No one's watching, soulless take it far

Til we wake up, we play all, we rollin' them dice
We're living on the edge, yeah, cause we 'bout that life
Say we wake up, we play all, we rollin' them dice
We're living on the edge, yeah, we're living on the edge, yeah

We get far, without y'all, than ever
Don't look down, we're in this together
Do walk down, without fall, whatever
We get far, we're higher than ever
Higher than ever
We get far, we're higher than ever
