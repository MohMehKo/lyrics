King Push

I don't live in my fears
I just swallow my tears
It ain't all in my head
Life is just a nightmare
I don't care if you care
I just know it ain't fair
Ain't no time to prepare
Life is just a nightmare
I don't live in my fears
I just swallow my tears
It ain't all in my head
Life is just a nightmare
I don't care if you care
I just know it ain't fair
Ain't no time to prepare
Life is just a nightmare

Push
You can run but you can't hide
Push
You can run but you can't hide
Push
You can run but you can't hide
You can run but you can't hide

Rapstar, trapstar, you can call me black czar
Duffle bag boy money buried in the backyard
Rather count a hundred thou', you can keep your black card
Got the bases covered, kitchen covered when we stack hard
Spend it all, 200 on the dashboard
Every verse is like a dope dealer's crash course
Every trip another stamp in the passport
So what you mothafuckas mad for?

I don't live in my fears
I just swallow my tears
It ain't all in my head
Life is just a nightmare
I don't care if you care
I just know it ain't fair
Ain't no time to prepare
Life is just a nightmare
I don't live in my fears
I just swallow my tears
It ain't all in my head
Life is just a nightmare
I don't care if you care
I just know it ain't fair
Ain't no time to prepare
Life is just a nightmare

Push
You can run but you can't hide
Push
You can run but you can't hide
Push
You can run but you can't hide
You can run but you can't hide

Walk with your team
And live in my shade
Walk with your team
And live in my shade
It's a wonderful day
Let's sleep, drive or pray
It's a wonderful day
Let's sleep, drive or pray
It's a wonderful day
Let's sleep, drive or pray
It's a wonderful day
Let's sleep, drive or pray
