Love seems like we were born tonight
Every second we spend I am living again
Words can't contain what's in our eyes
Time runs fast cause the close will begin

We get lost in the space
Feel our hearts race
It's OK... as long as we're together

We can live a lifetime in one night
Hold my hand and never leave my side
I will never forget you till I die
We can live a lifetime, a lifetime in one night
Yeahhh
Yeahhh
We can live a lifetime, a lifetime in one night

Eventually everything must come to end
From the moment when we kissed
Hey, I already miss you
Now is our chance to began
Baby let's not wait

We can live a lifetime in one night
Hold my hand and never leave my side
I will never forget you till I die
We can live a lifetime, a lifetime in one night
Yeahhh
Yeahhh
We can live a lifetime, a lifetime in one night
