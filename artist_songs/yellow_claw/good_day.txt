You make me feel like
All those kids that
Were supposed to stay the night but
Changed their mind and called their mommy
You are not me, I am dirty
You make me feel like
All those kids that
Were supposed to stay the night but
Changed their mind and called their mommy
You are not me

Remember that day
We met for coffee and you were late
Yeah we shat all about you and you mostly
But a bit about me
And then now we back to yours
And I never been there before
On the blue line subway
Yeah I think it was raining
Yeah you made me a painting
Sing a song about dolphins
Young love, was calling

It was a good day
Oh, what a good day
But it is long gone now
When all the stars fell down
It was a good day
Oh, what a good day
That day you broke my heart
I loved you way too hard
Now I'm free

Remember so well
That time when I found a dog
I thought you'd be cool
Not cool at all
When you opened the door (come on)
You said I was your soulmate
And I was there on my way
On the blue line subway
And I think it was snowing
'Cause the city was glowing
Yeah I started to notice
Young love, was broken

It was a good day
Oh, what a good day
But it is long gone now
When all the stars fell down
It was a good day
Oh, what a good day
That day you broke my heart
I loved you way too hard
Now I'm free

Free, free, free falling
