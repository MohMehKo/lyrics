We've been dancing too long
Music has stopped, but the high is too strong
And all this money is depressing
Dollars getting greener, but we'll never learn a lesson
Never learn to lack it, we will never learn to keep it
Never learn to love, but we will never learn to see it
Say we will never learn to love, but we will never learn to see it

And they are drunk, but we're not down
Oh oh oh ooh, oh oh oh ooh, woah oh oh oh
And they are faded, but we're smoked out
Oh oh oh ooh, oh oh oh ooh, woah oh oh oh

Say hate, say we hated so
Tell me something, we're stronger, better oh oh oh ooh
Do we say enough, we were on our own
Now we're drowning in champagne
Say hate, say we hated so
Tell me something, we want it better oh oh oh ooh
So we said enough, hit the bottle up
Now we're drowning in champagne
Now we're drowning in champagne
Now we're drowning in champagne

Smell the shots in my hair
The smell of dirt on your hand
Yeah, I'm busy getting richer now we're in trouble
Drake says now we're in trouble, I don't mean to be in trouble
The screaming doesn't help cause my echo won't sing
I'm running outta air cause I'm drowning in our drinks
It's cause we're never learned to love and we were never learned to see it

And they are drunk, but we're not down
Oh oh oh ooh, oh oh oh ooh, woah oh oh oh
And they are faded, but we're smoked out
Oh oh oh ooh, oh oh oh ooh, woah oh oh oh

Say hate, say we hated so
Tell me something, we're stronger, better oh oh oh ooh
Do we say enough, we were on our own
And now we're drowning in champagne
Say hate, say we hated so
Tell me something, we want it better oh oh oh ooh
So we said enough, hit the bottle up
Now we're drowning in champagne
Now we're drowning in champagne
