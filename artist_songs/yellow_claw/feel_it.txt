Everybody's telling me to let go, to let go, no
But they don't know that all I see is ego, yeah ego, no
Stop, hold up, I know, I'll never be whole
They took all of my pieces, my pieces, my pieces

I, will lift up, will lift up
I, won't give up, won't give up

Do you feel it? Do you feel it? What I say say
Do you feel it? Do you feel it? What I say say
Do you feel it? Do you feel it? What I say say
Do you feel it? Do you feel it? What I say say

I have lost my fear I've lost emotions, emotions no
Let's go forever floating in the ocean, the ocean no
Stop, hold up, I know, I'll never be whole
They took all of my pieces, my pieces, my pieces

I, will lift up, will lift up
I, won't give up, won't give up

Do you feel it? Do you feel it? What I say say
Do you feel it? Do you feel it? What I say say
Do you feel it? Do you feel it? What I say say
Do you feel it? Do you feel it? What I say say

I don't know, I just cannot let go
Cause I cannot throw these feelings out the window
I got this, I got this
Hear me, hear me, I got this
I got this, I got this, hear me, hear me
I got this

Do you feel it? Do you feel it? (do you feel it)
Do you feel it? Do you feel it? (do you feel me)
Do you feel it? Do you feel it? (this feeling)
Do you feel it? Do you feel it? (do you feel me)
Do you feel it? Do you feel it? (do you feel me)
Do you feel it? Do you feel it?
Do you feel it? Do you feel it?
Do you feel it? Do you feel it?
Do you feel it? Do you feel it?
