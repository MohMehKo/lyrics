If I'm stressing you out, why don't you go?
You're wasting your time with your lies so...
You've been breaking me down, now it's enough
'cause you would do it again and again, oh, oh

I hope that you'll be gone soon
I can't take no more, oh, no
I hope that you'll be gone soon
I can't take no more, nooo

You shot me right in the face with a shotgun
You shot me right in the face with a shotgun
You shot me, you shot me, you shot me, you shot me 
You shot me right in the face with a shotgun

Oh, I will never fall for your lies again, oooh, oh
Oh, I will never fall for your lies again, woah, oh

You shot me right in the face with a shotgun
You shot me right in the face with a shotgun

You shot me right in the
You shot me right in the
You shot me right in the face with a shotgun (shotgun [x12])

Yellow motherfucking Claw

No, I can't take no more, nooo

If I'm letting you down, I'm letting you out
I'm wiping your dirt off my soul
You're talking a lot but you're pissing me off
What you try to say doesn't matter no more

I hope that you'll be gone soon
I can't take no more, oh, no
I hope that you'll be gone soon
I can't take no more, nooo

Oh, I will never fall for your lies again (again)
Oh, I will never fall for your lies again, woah, oh

You shot me right in the face with a shotgun
You shot me right in the face with a shotgun

You shot me right in the
You shot me right in the
You shot me right in the face with a shotgun
