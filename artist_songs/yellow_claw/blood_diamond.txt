Too good to be true, Imma prove 'em wrong.
If you're a mistake, I will make some more.
'cause you got me going up, going down, going round.
I love this game, yeah.

I don't need liquor to wash away.
You love my sins and I love your pain.
'cause you got me going mad, going bad, I'm blacking out.
Till I say, yeah.

We don't need to be saved.
If you fall, don't you worry.

I'm gonna hit the roof and smash all the lights.
I'll shine me down on all of you, 'cause I'm a star, star star.
I'll take you with me when we blaze through the night.
'cause you're diamond made of blood, blood, blood.

We don't need to be saved.
If you fall, don't you worry.

Your like a diamond in flesh and blood.
My hunger gets louder and screams for more.
Yea you got me going up going down.
Going round and make me wait eh.

Got nothing to lose cause the night is young.
They wait for the lights but they wont come on.
Cause you got me going bad, blacking out.
I can't come out till say yea.

We don't need to be saved.
If you fall, don't you worry.

I'm gonna hit the roof and smash all the lights.
I'll shine me down on all of you, 'cause I'm a star, star star.
I'll take you with me when we blaze through the night.
'cause you're diamond made of blood, blood, blood.

We don't need to be saved.
If you fall, don't you worry.
