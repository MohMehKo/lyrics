Say you wanna spend some time
Want someone to do it right
Well baby I'm free tonight
Everybody needs that one good fire in their life
And if you wanna burn I got the light
Let my body be your guide
Watch your breathing sync with mine
Keep your hands inside the ride

Oh-oh, oh-oh yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh yeah
Thought an everlasting love would end up lost
So we got into it before the moon is gone

No looking back, eyes on mine
Need to live and let go
Since we met, on my mind, you been on it the most
You can take it how you want it
You know the invitation's open

I give my every, I give my everything, for what?
Love and devotion, you don't know what that means, at all
You give your every, you give your everything, for what?
Love and devotion, that's all I really need and want

No looking back, eyes on mine
Need to live and let go
Since we met, on my mind, you been on it the most
You can take it how you want it
You know the invitation's open
