[STORI:]
You said we can go anywhere
Anywhere your heart desires
So I guess we 'bout to take it there
Take it there, I love it when we go there, ah-ah
When you do that thing, you make me so, ah-ah
Trembling, ay-oh
When you kiss me like, you get me so charged up
Adrenaline, ah-oh

Asking can we disappear
We say nay-ah, later, later, like it
And we're riding through the endless sunset
Sunset, oooh
On a rose horizon
On a rose horizon

Ye-ye-ye Yellow motherfucking Claw!

Let's get down for a minute, let's get real for a minute
Have a private moment with the weirdos in it, yeah
Don't even need to speak and I'm with it
You know you're just the perfect thing, oh

Asking can we disappear
We say nay-ah, later, later, like it
And we're riding through the endless sunset
Sunset, oooh
On a rose horizon
On a rose horizon

Ye-ye-ye Yellow motherfucking Claw!

On a rose horizon
On a rose horizon
