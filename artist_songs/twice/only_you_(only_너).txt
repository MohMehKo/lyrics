Only, oh only, only 너
Only, oh only, only 너
Only, oh only, only 너
Only 너

이상해 처음엔 상상 못했는데
Just like a sugar rush
조금씩 넌 다가와
지친 내 맘 문을 두드린
그때부터일까

좋은 친구라고 생각했었는데
나도 모르게 자꾸 니 생각이 나
볼이 빨개져 웃음만 나와
이미 시작된 love

달콤해 넌 마치 chocolate candy
감출 수 없이 커진 내 맘 보여줄래
Let's go

늘 함께 있어줘 날 두고 가지마 boy
이젠 알아 with my heart 난 only 너
내 눈을 봐 boy 하트 가득하잖아
누가 뭐라 해도 난 only, only 너

Only, oh only, only 너
Only, oh only, only 너
Only, oh only, only 너
Only 너

난 O N L Y 너야 don't ask why
진짜 사랑엔 다 이유가 없는 법
Call me “jelly” 불러줘 매일
우리 둘만의 code 설레는 love mode

Baby, baby, tell me 어떻게 생각해
뭐가 그리 복잡해 너도 날 원하잖니
아닌 척해도 넌 티나 티나 that's right
자 이리와 kiss me butterfly

Ooh 조금만 스쳐도 난 떨려
Ooh 조금만 닿아도 심장이
콩닥, 콩닥, 콩닥 분명해 L O V E
Let's go

늘 함께 있어줘 날 두고 가지마 boy
이젠 알아 with my heart 난 only 너

더 기다리겐 하지마 내 답은 하나야
Only 너, always 너
간지러운 첫사랑 날아갈 것만 같아
Only 너, always 너

내 손을 꼭 잡아 never ever 놓지마
Only 너, always 너
너와 나 against the world 난 두렵지 않아
Only 너, always 너

Only, oh only, only you
Only, oh only, only you
Only, oh only, only you
Only you

It's weird, I didn't imagine it at first
Just like a sugar rush
You slowly approached me
And knocked on the doors of my tired heart
Is that when it started

I thought you were a good friend
I keep thinking of you before I know it
My cheeks get red and I only smile
The love's already begun

You're sweet you're just like chocolate candy
I want to show you how big my heart has grown that I can't hide anymore
Let's go

Always stay with me, don't leave me boy
Now I know with my heart I've got only you
Look into my eyes boy, it's full of hearts
No matter what anyone says I've got only, only you

Only, oh only, only you
Only, oh only, only you
Only, oh only, only you
Only you

I've got O N L Y you don't ask why
Real love has no reasons
Call me “jelly” call me every day
Our secret code fluttering love mode

Baby, baby, tell me what do you think
Why is it so complicated, you want me too
You pretend you don't but I can tell, I can tell that's right
Now come here kiss me butterfly

Ooh I tremble when we brush a little
Ooh when we touch a little, my heart goes
Pitter, patter, pitter it's for sure L O V E
Let's go

Always stay with me, don't leave me boy
Now I know with my heart I've got only you
Look into my eyes boy, it's full of hearts
No matter what anyone says I've got only, only you

Only you

Okay, let's go
Don't make me wait any longer, I've only got one answer
Only you, always you
Ticklish first love makes me feel like I'm gonna fly
Only you, always you

Hold my hand tightly, never ever let go
Only you, always you
You and me against the world, I'm not afraid
Only you, always you

Always stay with me, don't leave me boy
Now I know with my heart I've got only you
Look into my eyes boy, it's full of hearts
No matter what anyone says I've got only, only you

Always stay with me, don't leave me boy
Now I know with my heart I've got only you
Look into my eyes boy, it's full of hearts
No matter what anyone says I've got only, only you
