someday I'll find someone who really loves me
and he will be the one to call me baby
and when he comes I know the stars will guide me
that he's the one, the one for me

and he will fall down on his knees
and ask if he could marry me

someday
I will fall in love
and maybe one day
a blessing from above
and everyday of every week
of every month of every season of the year
you'll be here
spending time in this crazy love
(crazy love)

I want someone who loves and hugs and kisses
and makes me smile when I am blue
I hope and pray that kind of love will find me
and when it does, it'll be for years

and he will fall down on his knees
and ask if he could marry me

someday
I will fall in love
and maybe one day
a blessing from above
and everyday of every week
of every month of every season of the year
you'll be here
spending time in this crazy love
(crazy love)

someday
I will fall in love
and maybe one day
a blessing from above
and everyday of every week
of every month of every season of the year
you'll be here
spending time in this crazy love
