yes always do more
wag kang matakot
everything is ok
dont be afraid to explore
express yourself, express yourself
do the moves
you can do many things just do it

everyday is a new day
adventure always comes your way
aralin ang bagay bagay
cause all things work together for good

minsan when life gets boring
you should try things
that you've never tried before
wag kang matakot
kung di alam ang gagawin
enjoy life and feel it
you go out and try

yes always do more
wag kang matakot
everything is ok
dont be afraid to explore
express yourself, express yourself
do the moves
you can do many things just do it
(do it)

itaas ang iyong mga kamay
wag kang matakot na iwagayway
happy together with all your friends
party together until the day ends
its part of growing up
dont be afraid just express yourself

yes always do more
wag kang matakot
everything is ok
dont be afraid to explore
express yourself, express yourself
do the moves
you can do many things

maraming bagay na pwede pang masubukan at matutunan
give it what you got
show us what you got
life is a blessing, love the moment
express yourself and never be scared
everybody hands in the air
express yourself and never be scared
just do it
aim for the stars and make yourself proud
express yorself and never be scared
just do it
muster the courage and say it out loud

express yourself, dream and be on your way
everything is possible if you put your mind to it
go get up, go get it just do it
