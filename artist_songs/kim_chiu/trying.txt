I've finally know what the meaning of love is
I've finally know how it will end
I've finally know when to make decisions
I've finally know how to control

But the weird thing that I'm feeling
Is not the same
And I don't know what I'm feeling
And I don't know how it remains

And I'm trying to do my best, do my best for you
And I'm trying to be myself, be myself for you
Oh it's just hard to love but the love is strong
I just can't feel the love and I feel that it's not wrong
I'm trying to do my best, do my best
Just to love you

I saw you with someone and it's hard to explain
To explain the feeling that can't go away
It's hard to forget what you did to me
I don't really know what my feeling should be

But the weird thing that I'm feeling
Is not the same
And I don't know what I'm feeling
And I don't know how it remains

And I'm trying to do my best, do my best for you
And I'm trying to be myself, be myself for you
Oh it's just hard to love but the love is strong
I just can't feel the love and I feel that it's not wrong
I'm trying to do my best, do my best
Just to love you, love you

I finally know what the meaning of love is...
