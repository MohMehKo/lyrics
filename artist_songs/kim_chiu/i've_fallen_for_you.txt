[Kim:]
What is this I'm feeling
I just can't explain
When you're near,
I'm just not the same
I try to hide it
Try not to show it
It's crazy
How could it be?

I've fallen for you
Finally my heart gave in
And I've fallen in love
I finally know how it feels

[Gerald:]
When you said hello
I look in your eyes
Suddenly I felt good inside
Is this really happen
Or am I just dreamin'
I guess it's true
I can't belive

[Both:]
I've fallen for you
Finally my heart gave in
And I've fallen in love
I finally know how it feels
So this is love

[Gerald:]
Doesn't matter where I am
[Kim:]
Thoughts of you still linger in my mind
[Both:]
No matter what time of day
I've really really fallen for you

[Both:]
I've fallen for you
Finally my heart gave in
And I've fallen in love
I finally know how it feels

I've fallen for you
Finally my heart gave in
And I've fallen in love
I finally know how it feels
So this is love
