I hate the way you walk
Hate the way you talk
Hate the way you look at me

I hate the way you smile
Hate those big brown eyes
Cause I know there not for me

[Chorus:]
Cause/but we can never be
More than friends and it hurts me
Every time I close my eyes
All I see is you and this
Crazy love, crazy love,
Oh this crazy love, crazy love...

I hate thinking of you
Cause every time I do
I just keep on missing you
And I hate the way I feel every time you're near
Cause it feel like time standing still

[Chorus]

I hate it when you're blue
And how I care for you
Hate the way my heart decides
And I hate those sleepless nights
And the pain I kept inside
But I keep pretending it's all right

[Chorus]

I don't know what to do
Hate me for loving you
Cause I know its wrong for me to say
I love you
