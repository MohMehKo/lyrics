We sail into the black
We sail into the black
We sail into the black
We sail into the black

And all those secrets got lost in your eyes
And all those regrets, you hold inside
And all those memories, left by design
And all those mysteries, lost in your eyes
Lost in your eyes

We sail into the black
We sail into the black

And all those footsteps, washed in the tides
And all those droplets, blood into wine
And all those heartaches, tears that you've cried
And all those mistakes washed in the tides
Washed in the tides

We sail into the black
We sail into the black

I stare at the stricken, the follies of man
And the horror that lives in your eyes
And once were forgiven
The mind explodes in waves of terror

Burn my eyes, tear at the skin
The crawling beneath will begin
Side by side
Pounding the heretic drums
As we rise or we fall

And all these scars, the nightmare it calls
The fear and betrayal begin, we've come so far
The shit we ingest, with a mouthful of spit and protest
We sail into the black
The black candle fades, go disappear
Lost and forever broken, shattered like glass
The scars and the sex, the lies and the fables we tell
And all we are, this fate is your choice
Regrets that you'll take to the grave
These threads of silk that held this together
Rotting and curdled as milk
We sail into the black
