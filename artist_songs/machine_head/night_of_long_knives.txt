You won't see us come
You won't see us come
You won't see us come
You won't see us come

You won't see us come
In the night
With these knives
And these bloodstains on our hands
And these bloodstains on our hands
Paint the walls
Taste the blade
On the night of long knives

Midnight we KILL

In summer of '69, there came a prophet
His words were used to propel the minds of the weak
He sprawled them balls deep within the desert
His followers into the belly of the beast
Don't look into his eyes
Buried with knowledge past the point of no return
The pride of the work he'd done
The family all the dreams they could
The prophecy of Charles Manson and what had been done in the hills

Of Hollywood tonight

Sing of the angels
Sanity deprived
The family fatal
They bring the night of long knives
Deserts and the devil
Rapist of mind
The family fatal
Pitch black

You won't see us come
In the night
With these knives
And these bloodstains on our hands
Paint the walls
Taste the blade
On the night of long knives
Midnight we kill

The hills were echoing with their laughter
Happily ever after was a faded memory
Rosemary and the baby of Polanski
6 people dead and bloody
In the hills of family
Now screaming for their lives
Praying and pleading for lives of babies unborn
The spawn of hell they just begin
The horror of the splitting skin
Noose tied around their necks
To beat their dying breaths
In the hills

Of Hollywood tonight

Sing of the angels
Sanity deprived
The family fatal
They bring the night of long knives
Deserts and the devil
Rapist of mind
The family fatal
They bring the night of long knives

We have been so wrong
We will fall
We will fall
No tomorrow

We'll fall away tonight

Don't look into his eyes
Buried with knowledge past the point of no return
The pride of the work he'd done
The family all the dreams they could
The prophecy of Charles Manson and what had been done in the hills

Of Hollywood tonight

Sing of the angels
Sanity deprived
The family fatal
They bring the night of long knives
They bring the night of long knives
Deserts and the devil
Rapist of mind
The family fatal
They bring the night of long knives


You won't see us come
In the night
With these knives
And these bloodstains on our hands
And these bloodstains on our hands
Paint the walls
Taste the blade
On the night of long knives


You won't see us come
In the night
With these knives
On the night of long knives
