As I fall, over and over
Drunken through vodka

As I fall, over and over
Drunken through vodka and cola
Shard's of glass burning the back of my head
As I turn red all out war

Each one get on the floor
Red so hot follow the middle son
Concrete jump
Makes a boy look like a drunken grass

Every time I cross the line
I go, just leave me alone, I'll get by on my own
This whole world is ours so let's take it

Scrape the plate, trust you a little bit
Face so fucked

Scrape the plate, trust you a little bit
Face so fucked, blow out your leg, yeah
Spinning lies, make the man feel like
He can't meet a superstar

Take a hit, let the burn flow over you
Flow excel, expand inside of you
Cut your throat, that'll be crazy now
Ha, ha

Every time I cross the line
I go, just leave me alone, I'll get by on my own
This whole world is ours, so let's take it

Every time I cross the line
I push the boundaries out a little

Go, just leave me alone
(Every time I cross the line)
I'll get by on my own
(I push the boundaries out a little)
This whole world is ours, so let's take it
