There is no rose of such virtue 
As is the rose that bare Jesu; 
Alleluia. 

For in this rose contained was 
Heaven and earth in little space; 
Res miranda. 

By that rose we may well see 
That he is God in persons three, 
Pari forma. 

The angels sungen the shepherds to: 
Gloria in excelsis deo: 
Gaudeamus. 

Leave we all this worldly mirth, 
And follow we this joyful birth; 
Transeamus. 

Alleluia, res miranda, 
Pares forma, gaudeamus, 
Transeamus.
