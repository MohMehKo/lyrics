Lully, lulla, thow little tyne Child
By, by lully, lullay,
thow little tyne Child
By, by, lully, lullay.

O sisters too, how may we do,
For to preserve this day
This pore yongling for whom we singe:
By, by, lully lullay?

Lully, lullay, thow little tyne Child...

Herod, the king, in his raging
Chargid he hath this day
His men of might in his owne sight,
All yonge children to slay.
Lully, lullay, thow little tyne Child...
