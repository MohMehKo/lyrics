The Angel Gabriel from heaven came 
His wings as drifted snow, his eyes as flame 
"All hail" said he thou Holy Maiden Mary 
(to holy mary) 
Most highly favoured lady Gloria 
(Most highly favoured lady Gloria) 

For know a blessed mother thou shalt be 
All generations laud and honor thee 
Thy son shall be Emmanuel as seers foretold 
Most highly favoured lady Gloria 
(Most highly favoured lady Gloria) 

The gentle Mary meekly bowed her head 
"To me, be as it pleaseth God" she said 
"My soul shall laud and magnify his holy name" 
Most highly favoured lady Gloria 
(Most highly favoured lady Gloria) 

Of her Emmanuel, the Christ was born 
In Bethlehem all on a Christmas morn 
And everyone through out the world will ever say 
Most highly favoured lady Gloria
