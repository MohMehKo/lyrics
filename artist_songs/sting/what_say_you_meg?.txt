What say you, Meg?

There's a house on the hill that's come off for sale
It's a place I have known since I was a lad
And it needs a lick of paint and a hammer and a nail
But it's part of the boyhood dream I've always had

I climb up the hill with the evening news
I've been sent from the town to deliver
And I stand in the porch and gaze at the views
'Til my eyes are bruised by the sunset's glow on the river

I'd imagine a girl who would share my life
As dreamers all tend to do
And the face I always conjured up
Was no one else but you

What say you, Meg?
What's this story's ending?
I want you, Meg, by my side
What's the use, Meg,
To gaze at a view on your own?

For rich or for poorer
In sickness, in health
I will see this through, Meg
No chance of this ending
Such a view, Meg
As we gaze from a house on the hill

To love and to cherish
To have and to hold
I'm a hard man to beat
If I may be so bold

And I promise it all by the sweat of my brow
Tell me what say you, Meg, now?

What say you, Meg?
How's this story shaping?
I want you, Meg
As we gaze from a house on the hill

For rich or for poorer
In sickness, in health
I'll be hard to replace
If I say so myself
And I promise it all by the sweat of my brow
Tell me what say you, Meg, now?
