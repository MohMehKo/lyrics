[Verse 1]
It can be 100 degrees in the shade
I won't complain about a thng i'm over it
Got a fan blowin' on me man 
I'm so cool on you don't you understand

[Chorus]
Like the wind in November
That was cold what you did I ain't bitter
I'm cool on you babe, I'm cool on you babe
I'm cool on you babe, So cool on you babe
All the games that you played
Got my heart growin' cold like a cube in a tray
I'm cool on you babe, I'm cool on you babe
I'm cool on you babe, So cool on you babe

[Verse 2]
Dinner cookin' A good book to read
And a place to rest my feet
I sit and I wait for the breeze
Blow through my window ledge
To help me clear my head I'm sorry I 
Can't be that girl Who waits on the side
For my man to come back right
Got too much respect for myself
I knew this all too well 
I can't let you waste my time

[Chorus]
Like the wind in November
That was cold what you did I ain't bitter
I'm cool on you babe, I'm cool on you babe
I'm cool on you babe, So cool on you babe
All the games that you played 
Got my heart growin' cold like a cube in a tray
I'm cool on you babe, I'm cool on you babe
I'm cool on you babe, So cool on you babe

[Verse 3]
Call up that girl you met at the club
'Cause I'm not your one night love
I'm not gonna be number 3
'Cause I would rather leave
Heartbreak and pain ain't in my destiny
You're like a cross between back taxes and
Bad traffic, I'm through
I can't be messin' with you
Build me up just to bring me down
I'm running out of reasons to stick around

[Chorus]
Like the wind in November
That was cold what you did I ain't bitter
I'm cool on you babe, I'm cool on you babe
I'm cool on you babe, So cool on you babe
All the games that you played
Got my heart growin' cold like a cube in a tray
I'm cool on you babe, I'm cool on you babe
I'm cool on you babe, So cool on you babe

[Verse 4]
When you realise that you had a good thing
Don't even try I'm off doing my own thing
'Cause I realise the way you are is how you'll be
Imma be alright, I don't need you comin' around
Keepin' me leveled to the ground
I don't make the rules, You snoose You loose
Do what you choose I'm cool on you

[Chorus]
Like the wind in November
That was cold what you did I ain't bitter 
(In November that was cold what you did to me)
I'm cool on you babe, I'm cool on you babe
I'm cool on you babe, So cool on you babe
(I'm not mad and you need to know I'm cool on you boy I'm letting you go)
All the games that you played
Got my heart growin' cold like a cube in a tray
I'm cool on you babe, I'm cool on you babe
I'm cool on you babe, So cool on you babe

Boy I'm C double O... L 
Can't you tell that I'm cool on you
That I'm cool on you
Boy I'm C double O... L 
Can't you tell that I'm cool on you
That I'm cool on you
That was cold what you did to me (Hey, Hey, Hey)

Ha, I'm Over You!
