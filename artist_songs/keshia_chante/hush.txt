Do you really wanna talk, there's nothing left to say, you said it all (you said it all)
And I can't change your mind, that you've already made, you know it all (you know it all)
And if moving on, is where you are, I've already heard it, so don't say a word
Just hush (just hush) 

Don't try
It only makes it complicated
baby when you try to fake, in your eyes
they are saying everything, so go ahead and keep it in 
just hush (hush)

I don't see the point to relive everyday
we had it all (we had it all)
Cause when you get so high
And give your heart away, you gonna fall (you gonna fall)
And if moving on, is where you are, I've already heard it, so don't say a word
just hush (hush)

Don't try
It only makes it complicated
baby when you try to fake, in your eyes
they are saying everything, go ahead and keep it in 
and if moving on, is where you are
I've already heard it so don't say a word
Don't try
It only makes it complicated
baby when you try to fake, in your eyes
they are saying everything, so go ahead and keep it in 
just hush
