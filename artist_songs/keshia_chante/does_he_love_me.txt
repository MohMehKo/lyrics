(Oh) Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na [x3]
But does he love me, 
Does he really love me?
(Hey yo Kesh) (Uh huh)

Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na [x3]
But does he love me, 
Does he really love me?

Met him at the mall in the parking lot
He said Keshia lookin' good and your lookin hot
He was runnin' game and it sounded good
But does he love me, 
Does he really love me?
Talkin on the phone almost every night
He said he didn't want me chillin' with no other guy
Am I the only one or was it just a lie
But does he love me, 
Does he really love me?

[Chorus:]
Is it all about me?
Will I be his one and only
He don't know a thing about me
Should I really be his shorty?
Cuz does he love me, 
Does he really love me?

Is it all about me?
Will I be his one and only
He don't know a thing about me
Should I really be his shorty?
(Yeah ye…)

[Verse 2]
Thinking to myself is he leading me on?
But I felt that I'm right I don't wanna be wrong
Should I get with him 'cause I need to know?
Cuz does he love me, 
Does he really love me?

What am I supposed to do, now?
I'm falling for this boy and he has no clue
Is it just a phase he's got?
Am I down for the way yay…?

[Chorus:]
Is it all about me?
Will I be his one and only
He don't know a thing about me
Should I really be his shorty?
Cuz Does he love me, 
Does he really love me?

Is it all about me?
Will I be his one and only
He don't know a thing about me
Should I really be his shorty?
(Yeah ye…)

[Foxy Brown:]
I got 99 problems, but a nigga ain't one
Missy I throws it down crazy
Yes I spill anoder down babeee….
Listen head or foxy playin with that money 
I’m the DK general 
My boxy aint nothing
I got this crew name A MILEO
From mainced town 
Wished that cranberry 
Layed back with the shades down
A yo kesh with the mother young world
When i'm done you’d be stunting
Like there’s nothing-old gurl
Scalping in Quebec, Jacob on ur neck
Wid u stunting through Ontario, fox in da stereo
I’m in the hood going hard in the boulevard
Make hard in holes, n the old hood adores u
Mah doo block keep it fresh peer s dots
Nearing its ear ha, holla if ya hear fox
Keshia, fox in the Kingston blocks
Stay on hard in the drop top dealing [rap fades]

[Keshia:]
Is it all about me?
Will I be his one and only
He don't know a thing about me
Should I really be his shorty?
Cuz Does he love me,
Does he really love me?

Is it all about me?
Will I be his one and only
He don't know a thing about me
Should I really be his shorty?
But Does he love me,
Does he really love me?

[Keshia talking:]
Thinking bout it all its got feelings inside
If I try to hold it in I'll be living a ride
Is that, every little thing that I should
of need
Cause does he love me babeeee…. Oh…

(Oh) Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na [x3]
Is it all about me?
Will I be his one and only
He don't know a thing about me
Should I really be his shorty?
Cause Does he love me,
Does he really love me?

Is it all about me?
Will I be his one and only
He don't know a thing about me
Should I really be his shorty?
Cause Does he love me, 
Does he really love me?
