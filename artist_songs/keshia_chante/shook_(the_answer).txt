Yeah
To all my chicas and my fly mama citas
For real
This is UOMO
Yeah 
C'mon

Yeah yeah yeah

We was out to catch a flick
Just me and my clique
I made sure that we wasn't late
Cause the movie's starting at 8
I was chillin in my seat
Took the first one i could see
This boy came and sat beside next to me
He really blew my mind

Can't concentrate
Feeling sweaty
Gettin' butterflies
Gettin' dizzy
Gotta keep it cool
Gotta keep it fly
And remember he is just a guy
Tell me what is this i feel inside
I never felt like this before 
But i got to keep it real tonight
This boy he got me shook
Cause he's lookin so fine
He's gonna be mine
The way that he moves just gets to me 
Keep shakin' that thing and makin' me sing
He got just what i like
Everyday of the week
My baby so sweet
Come over here, let's hook up tonite
You lookin so right
Your game is so tight
This boy he got me shook

Backstage at the fashion show
Lights down i'm ready to go
Walking on down the runway 
I saw the boy from the other day
He was checkin my silky gear
Didn't expect him to be here
And keshia's got a secret
He's the boy that i want to be with

Can't concentrate
Feeling sweaty
Gettin' butterflies
Gettin' dizzy
Gotta keep it cool
Gotta keep it fly
And remember he is just a guy
Tell me what is this i feel inside
