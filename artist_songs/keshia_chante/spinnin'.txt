Me and my girls hangin' out tonight
We decide we gonna step in line for the club, to see what's up
Didn't know if we was getting in
No ID - we don't got anything to show, oh no

Oh my God! Tell me what do I see
A hunny right in front of me and he's clockin' me
He steps thru. I hope that I would too
Then the bouncer takes one look at me "what are you fifteen?"

U know u had me spinnin
Right from the beginnin'
When U put dat record on 
U know I'm bouts to get my groove on
And I can't even imagine
If this thing didn't happen
The night is just beginnin'
And I'm already spinnin'

I tell the bouncer "I'm herre all the time"
Didn't believe me, said he heard that line before, and many more.
I try to tell that I'm 21 (nuh, uh girl)
Come on man "I just look real young" Cuh huh.

I say "please you gots to be to cool wit me"
Then he smiled and said "okay, alright but just for tonight"
I step inside. And right there before my eyes
He's in the dj both with headphones on,
And he's playing my song, Oh my God!!!!! 

Got me spinnin' right round like a record baby!
