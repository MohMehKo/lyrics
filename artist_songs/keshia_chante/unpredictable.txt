[INTRO]
Everything I do is for you, 
Your unpredictable but I still love you baby

[VERSE 1]
Why you trippin, You were cool yesterday
Is there, something I can say to bring your smile back my way?
I'd say I’m sorry if I knew what I did wrong
But I still carry on cause my feelings are so strong

What else can I do? (What can I do?)
Do for you to prove (to prove)
Prove that this is true
I need to know cause...

[Chorus]
Everytime I think were all right,
Why you gotta go and change your mind baby?
Everything I do is for you,
(Everything i do)
Your unpredictable but I still love you baby

[Verse 2]
It's so confusing, things always seemed okay
When we couldn’t stay away
From each other for a day
Boy one minute you could make me feel so good
Doing everything you could
But today I wish you would

Why you gotta be? (Why you gotta be?)
Buggin out on me? (On me)
Won’t you tell me please?
I need to know cause...

[Chorus]
Everytime I think were all right 
Why you gotta go and change your mind baby
Everything I do is for you
(Everything i do)
Your unpredictable but I still love you baby

Thought I knew (I thought I knew)
I’m so confused (I'm so confused)
What’s goin on (what’s been going on?)
Where did we go wrong (where did we go wrong baby!)

[Chorus]
Everytime I think were all right
(Everytime I think we’re all right baby) 
Why you gotta go and change your mind baby
(Why you gotta go and change your mind)
Everything I do is for you
(Everything I do)
Your unpredictable but I still love you baby
(I still love you)

Everytime I think were all right 
(Everytime I think we’re all right baby)
Why you gotta go and change your mind baby
(Change your mind)
Everything I do is for you
(For you, For you)
Your unpredictable but I still love you baby
