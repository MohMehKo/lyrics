[VERSE 1]
Lately..baby...you make me feel like I'm not a priority
Frankly...baby... to treat me this way
Who gave you the authority

It's not supposed to feel like this
And I refuse to feel like this
Do I have to mention the lack of attention
That you've been showing me

[PRE CHORUS]
Say You wanna leave - Go
Calling my girls to let em know
Warned you bout me...from the go
I won't take this....hell no

[CHORUS]
If your Kickin with your boys tonight 
I'm alright...it's singles night (just go)

I'm gettin crazy with my girls tonight
And I'm alright...it's singles night (just go)

If you don't feel like coming back again
Don't think again, stay with your friends (just go)
I'm gettin crazy with my girls tonight
And I'm alright...it's singles night (just go)

[VERSE 2]
So go do....what you do...that's cool with me
If that's cool with you
So don't, i won't, come home at three 
I'll be at the party
From now on it will be like this
You rolled the dice you took a risk
I won't ever mention the lack of affection
That you've been giving me

[PRE CHORUS]
Say you wanna leave
Calling my girls to let em know
Warned you bout me...from the go??
I won't take this....hell no

[CHORUS]
If your kickin with your boys tonight 
That's alright...it's singles night (just go)

I'm gettin crazy with my girls tonight
And I'm alright...it's singles night (just go)

If you don't feel like coming back again
Don't think again, stay with your friends (just go)
I'm gettin' crazy with my girls tonight
And I'm alright...it's singles night (just go)

[BREAK]
Here's to all the times you never listened to me
Never listened to me

Here's to all the times that you've been lying to me
You've been lying to me

[CHORUS]
If your kickin with your boys tonight 
Dance alright...it's singles night (just go)

I'm gettin crazy with my girls tonight
And I'm alright...it's singles night (just go)

If you don't feel like coming back again
Don't think again, stay with your friends (just go)
I'm gettin crazy with my girls tonight
And I'm alright...it's singles night (just go)

If your kickin with your boys tonight
