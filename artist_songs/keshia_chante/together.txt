Not to young to see
That true love comes once in a lifetime
So come with me

Its all in the game
But as long as were together
We'll make it through the rain, ya

[Pre-Chorus]

All the things that we've been through
No one can take ya place
You and I against the world
Lets make it last forever
You're the only one for me
