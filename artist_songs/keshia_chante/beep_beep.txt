Everytime my heart goes beep beep, its cause of you
Everytime my heart goes beep beep, its cause of you baby
Everytime my heart goes beep beep, its cause of you
Everytime my heart goes beep beep, its cause of you baby

Love the way we get down, totally unexpected
Love it when we hang out, think of you every second
Got me spinning like them 24s, ride low, go slow
Give me that feeling when you call, oh you make me want you more
I love the way it feels
Sometimes I think I'm dreaming but it's really something real
I love the way you touch, you might think it's simple but it's more than just enough

Everytime my heart goes beep beep, its cause of you
Everytime my heart goes beep beep, its cause of you baby
Everytime my heart goes beep beep, its cause of you
Everytime my heart goes beep beep, its cause of you baby

All I want is to be with you, you to be next to me
Your the reason for this heartbeat, you know exacly what i need
Got me spinning like them 24s, ride low, go slow
Give me that feeling when you call, oh you make me want you more
I love the way it feels
Sometimes I think I'm dreaming but it's really something real
I love the way you touch, you might think it's simple but it's more than just enough

Everytime my heart goes beep beep, its cause of you
Everytime my heart goes beep beep, its cause of you baby
Everytime my heart goes beep beep, its cause of you
