Catching a flight from LA it's been three weeks I've seen your face
Touching down at a quarter past 3. Lucky you, you must be home asleep
I wait for my bags - they're taking so long. 'Bout to call a cab to take me home
That's I feel a touch from behind. Turn around you're right before my eyes.

Standing there - I can't believe you came
It's 3 o'clock in the morning and it's pouring rain
There's something about the kinda love that you bring
Can't put my finger on it - guess it must be...

All these things
The little things that you do
They make my heart beat for you
All these things
The little things mean so much
You remind me each time we touch
Of all the little things

I sleep through the morning and wake up at two, just can't wait to spend the day with you
I head downstairs and the first thing I see is a note there waiting saying

"there's a concert tonight I thought you'd want to go
I hear dat Alicia's got a real good show"
Sometimes it seems you think of everything
You never cease to amaze. You know I'm loving

All these things
The little things that you do
They make my heart beat for you
All these things
The little things mean so much
You remind me each time we touch
Of all the little things

BGV (All these things you do keep me loving you)
All the little things that you do keep me in love with you, baby, yeah
