I don't wanna play no more,
tired, I run the score,

(I'm fighting for)

[Rap:]
Keshia, know I got you right,
ain't you ready baby,
yeah, it like every other chick was a loose loose,
them other birds, drove me coo coo,
and I see you in the street tryna' do you,
tell em' I put my spell on you, voodoo,
yeah, and if you really tryna' do me,
then hang it up like jordan, 2-3.
Now I got your little friends like, "who is he",
3 letters baby, MVP
ha, run one more play for me,
I pick you, and you roll with me,
I just wanna be the coach you can lean on, 
'cause baby I'm the king, lebron,
first pick when you enter the draft,
got a ring on you finger much bigger than Shaq,
she got a jersey on the wall with my name on the back,
and on the defense, back board when I make an attack

[Chorus:]
you make me hang my , jersey up,
jersey up, jersey up, jersey up,
put it up in the sky,
you make me hang my jersey up,
jersey up, jersey up, jersey up,
put my number up high (put my number up high)
the game is over, the game is over, ooh ooh ooh,
(there is no time left on the clock)
the game is over, the game is over, ooh ooh ooh,
ooh ooh ooh

yeah
