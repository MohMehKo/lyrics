[Verse 1]
Lay your head down on my pillow
You don't need words 'cause I-I know
But sometimes you walking around feeling defeated, hey yeah
Tell me your fears, I'll keep it a secret

[Pre-chorus]
Is it the moon? Is it the stars?
Why didn't I that you open your heart?
Is it the moon? Is it my eyes?
It's always an I even to realize

[Chorus]
I never felt a love like this
I never felt a love like this
I never though it could exist
I can never get enough love

I never felt a love like this
I never felt a love like this
I never though it could exist
I can never get enough love
Of your love love

Pillow talk talk talk talk
I get you when it's pillow talk talk talk talk
I get you when it's pillow talk talk talk talk
I get you when it's pillow talk, pillow talk

[Verse 2]
You can't weight the world right up on your shoulders
And you still act up on me when I tell you that I hurt
Tell me how you hold it inside when you're heated
Open up your heart and let me in, boy you need it

[Pre-chorus]
Is it the moon? Is it the stars?
Why didn't I that you open your heart?
Is it the moon? Is it my eyes?
It's always an I even to realize

[Chorus]
I never felt a love like this
I never felt a love like this
I never though it could exist
I can never get enough love

I never felt a love like this
I never felt a love like this
I never though it could exist
I can never get enough love
Of your love love

Pillow talk talk talk talk
I get you when it's pillow talk talk talk talk
I get you when it's pillow talk talk talk talk
I get you when it's pillow talk, pillow talk

[Bridge]
Seconds, minutes, hours I'll been waiting
Seconds, minutes, hours I'll been waiting
Seconds, minutes, hours I'll been waiting
Just to hear you talk, talk, love it when you talk, talk

Seconds, minutes, hours I'll been waiting
Seconds, minutes, hours I'll been waiting
Seconds, minutes, hours I'll been waiting
Just to hear you talk, talk

[Chorus]
I never felt a love like this
I never felt a love like this
I never though it could exist
I can never get enough love

I never felt a love like this
I never felt a love like this
I never though it could exist
I can never get enough love
Of your love love

Pillow talk talk talk talk
I get you when it's pillow talk talk talk talk
I get you when it's pillow talk talk talk talk
I get you when it's pillow talk, pillow talk

When the sun goes down I know you will come around
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down I know you will come around
And baby we can talk, I love it when we talk

I can never get enough love
Of your love love

I can never get enough love
Of your love love
