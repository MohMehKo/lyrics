I was working at the mall after school on a Friday 
You were with your mom, dont know what you were buying 
We made eye-contact, through the tee-shirt rack 
And I was hoping that you would say something to me (but you didnt) 
But you were too afraid to talk while your momma was present 
So when she left the store you came back in cause you left something 
Slipt your number to me, on the back of the receipt 
And you made me promise I would call you later (And I did) 
I thought I knew it.. 

[Chorus:] 
Thought I knew it from the first time I saw you 
Thought I knew it from the first time we met 
Thought I knew it from the first time we kicked it 
But I knew it from the first time we kissed (when we kissed) 
It felt just like we fell in love (when we kissed) 
I know right then I fell in love (when we kissed) 
Your lips showed me the purest love (when we kissed) 

When I got home from work it was 9 in the evening 
When we got off the phone it was 9 in the morning 
Now its Saturday, so we planned a date 
To meet up at 6 oclock at the movies 
We got there (got some snacks) 
Some drinks (it was dark) 
So we sat (in the back) 
Thats when you (stole my heart) 
Cause you kissed me, didnt know you would kiss me 
And I loved every bit fell in love with your kiss 

[Chorus:] 
Thought I knew it from the first time I saw you 
Thought I knew it from the first time we met 
Thought I knew it from the first time we kicked it 
But I knew it from the first time we kissed (when we kissed) 
It felt just like we fell in love (when we kissed) 
I know right then I fell in love (when we kissed) 
Your lips showed me the purest love (when we kissed) 

The touch of your hand, is where it began 
The feel of your heart, still wasnt enough 
But everything changed, on our first date 
Boy thats when it hit me, the moment you kissed me 
The touch of your hand, is where it began 
The feel of your heart, still wasnt enough 
But everything changed, on our first date 
Boy thats when it hit me, the moment you kissed me 

[Chorus] 

We kissed. We kissed... when we kissed, I thought I fell in love...
