I needed a friend and you were there like a brother
Thru good times and bad - always there for me
We were so tight I trusted you like no other
Now I miss you so much, the way you made me feel

Cause we would talk for hours on the phone
And you were always there to walk me home
Now looking back I guess I should have known
But I, I couldn't see it, now I feel it
Tell me how did I miss that
I'd give the world if I could just go back
To the day when "friends" was all you had in mind...
But now I see the true colours in your eyes

Then you stepped to me in a way that was more than I wanted
And when I said "No! I don't feel that way bout you"
The look on you face, said everything. And I got it.
And now I know I was right cause it's been weeks since I heard from you

We used to talk for hours on the phone
And you were always there to walk me home
Now looking back I guess I should have known
But I, I couldn't see it, now I feel it
Tell me how did I miss that
I'd give the world if I could just go back 
To the day when "friends" was all you had in mind...

But now I see the true colours in your eyes
Was everything we had a lie
Tell me now baby
Thought I knew you, thought it was true
I though that I had something special with you..
... oooh, why'd you have to go and
Ruin, such a good thing and,
We were so tight, thought it was right
And sometimes I wish was you was back in my life

Cause we would talk for hours on the phone
And you were always there to walk me home
Now looking back I guess I should have known
But I, I couldn't see it, now I feel it
Tell me how did I miss that
I'd give the world if I could just go back
To the day when "friends" was all you had in mind...

But now I see the true colours in your eyes
True colours shining through
Now I see you true colours painting you!
True colours in your eyes
