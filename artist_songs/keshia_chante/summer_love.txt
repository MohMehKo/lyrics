I looked in his pretty brown eyes and ever since I saw him 
Ive been checking for him seriously 
And when he walks by I say hi 
He dont reply like he doesnt even notice me 
But I know its all a front 
I can tell he really wants to come close and kick it to me 
But hes running out of time 
Hurry up and make up your mind 

[Chorus:] 
Im falling like autumn leaves 
you call like a winter breeze 
Cant wait til spring comes and leaves 
Cause I miss what I was getting in the summer time 
I remember (remember my) 

Summer Love, Summer Love (remember my) 
Summer Love, Summer Love 
Now that its cold I dont know here to go 
I cant wait for the seasons to change to bring me back to my 
Summer Love, Summer Love (I remember my) 
Summer Love, Summer Love (I remember my) 
Summer Love, Summer Love 
All I want is to take back the day we had to say goodbye 

I would of held on really tight 
If I would of realized that night we were gonna part 
Drove me crazy to go and even though Im gone 
I left him with a piece of my heart 
Though the seasons change my feelings remain 
And I know they will always be 
Until I find my summer love, hes all Ill be thinking of 

[Chorus:] 
Im falling like autumn leaves 
you call like a winter breeze 
Cant wait til spring comes and leaves 
Cause I miss what I was getting in the summer time 
I remember (I remember my) 

Summer Love, Summer Love (remember my) 
Summer Love, Summer Love 
Now that its cold I dont know here to go 
I cant wait for the seasons to change to bring me back to my 
Summer Love, Summer Love (I remember my) 
Summer Love, Summer Love (I remember my) 
Summer Love, Summer Love 
All I want is to take back the day we had to say goodbye 

Im just telling you what you told me baby, 
Never thought you could be so cold to me baby 
Just when I thought you would go with me baby 
Where did you go my summer love? 
Either Im confused or you lied to me baby 
Why you couldnt be here to ryde with me baby? 
In the middle of July you leave baby 
Where did you go my summer love? 

[Chorus] 

We had to say goodbye... we had to say goodbye...
