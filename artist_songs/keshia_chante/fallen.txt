We was just walking,just smiling and talking 
Then add to my surprise, got lost in your eyes 
This time they were different, and I found what it meant 
After I leaned in, I helplessly fell in 

Help me I've fallen in love, and now I can't get up 
Somewhere between your lips, is where I think my heart slipped 
I tried to catch myself, not even I could have helped myself from 
falling 
I think that I'm in love 

In love and I can't see,what's happing to me 
You blinded my thoughts, from what pain and tears taught 
See my hearts been broken before,it don't trust love anymore 
One kiss from you, I just let myself fall right through 

Got me hypnotized with your magaic spell, I got butterflies can't 
control myself 
Close my eyes at night and I dream of you, it's true, don't know 
what to do 
Don't stop now 
Since I let you in 
You showed me how 
You showed me how to love again, 
I've fallen please help me 

Got me hypnotized with your magic spell, I think that I'm in love 
Close my eyes at night and I dream of you, I think that I'm in love 
It's true,don't know what to do,don't stop now, I can't get up 
Its's true, don't know what to do, don't stop now, I think that I'm in 
love,in love
