[VERSE 1]
Long sleepless nights
and everything's not right
you should be here by my side
Things just ain't the same
how could we let it change
cause we were everything

[PRE HOOK]
I need you to know
I'll never let go of you and me
And I need you to trust
the love between us
when times are so tough I need you to see

[HOOK]
That I miss you, eh eh
That I miss you, eh eh
That I miss you, eh eh
At the end of the day I need you to say
I miss you
I miss you

[VERSE 2]
Long restless days
I'm battling with this pain
wish you could take it away from me
We're miles and miles apart
it's like living in the dark
it's messing with my heart, yes it is

[PRE HOOK]
I need you to know
I'll never let go of you and me
And I need you to trust
the love between us
when times are so tough I need you to see

[HOOK]
That I miss you, eh eh
That I miss you, eh eh
That I miss you, eh eh
At the end of the day I need you to say
I miss you

[BRIDGE]
I'm sick of watching the clock
you know I'm tired of waiting, waiting, waiting
Cause all this time apart
you know it's driving me crazy, crazy, crazy

(I need you to know, I'll never let go of you and me)

[HOOK]
That I miss you, eh eh
That I miss you, eh eh
That I miss you, eh eh
At the end of the day I need you to say
I miss you
I miss you
