Come with me let me lead the way
I will be the one that stands beside you
We could be anything we dream
As long as we keep dreaming it together

We'll ride the wind and soar above the clouds
Where we'll be free...

Come fly with me to a place where love has never been before
And you know. It'll just be you and me
Fly with me to a world where no one's ever been before
And you know we wont ever have to leave, come fly with me

So here we are where time stands still
And a perfect moment, it can last forever
Cause we both saw, the same shooting star
We made a wish and here we are together

As we ride the wind and soar through open skies
Now we are free...

Come fly with me to a place where love has never been before
And you know. It'll just be you and me
Fly with me to a world where no one's ever been before
And you know we wont ever have to leave
Fly with me

So free

Wont you come fly with me to a place where love has never been before
And you know - It'll just be you and me
Fly with me to a world where no one's ever been before
And you know we wont ever have to leave
Fly with me
