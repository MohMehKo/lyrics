We don't listen when you yelling and telling us,
Call us young dumb & rebellious, 
(Belly rings how we wear our clothes) 
Cannot,will not,live our lives the way you do yours, 
You get one life and we won't be bored 
So we flip through tricks off a skateboard, 
We know you scared for us,cause you care for us, 
Just be there for us and let us breathe 

Hey teachers, not another one of your long speeches 
How there's no hope and you can't reach us 
Why can't we be us, just jump up, rip off the bleachers and 

Stomp, soon as you hear the system thump 
I need to feel that, pop the trunk, 
All my ladies you wit me? 
fellas if you feel me,feel 
I want you to get up, I wanna see you jump and 
Stomp, soon as you feel the system thump 
I wanna feel that bump,bump,bump 
All my ladies you wit me? 
fellas if you feel me,feel me, 
I wanna see ya, I wanna see ya stomp 

Were not listening when you scream and yell 
with your parental judgemental selves 
Like you never been young before 
We cannot,will not,live our lives the way you dours 
We get one life and we won't be scared, 
So throw your hands up in the air, 
Instead of crowding us and doubting us, 
You outta be proud of us, and let us breathe 
Hey teachers, not another one of your long speeches 
How there's no hope and you can't reach us 
Why can't we be us,just jump up, rip off the bleachers and 

Cause we've had enough and 
We've had it up to here,and 
All we wanna do is have some fun,so please 
Don't suffocate us, let us breathe,breathe,breathe 
We've had enough and 
We've had it up to here, 
All we wanna is have some fun,so please 
Don't suffocate us,let us breathe,breathe,breathe 

All my Ladies,All my Ladies...
