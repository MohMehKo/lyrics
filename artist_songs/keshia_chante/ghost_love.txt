[VERSE 1:]
In the mist of the night 
In the mist of the night 
When everyone's asleep
He comes out from way height
It's a different life
Filled with hurt filled with fright
And for me and what's love
So he tries and he tries

[PRE CHORUS:]
It feels like I'm way passed the clouds
And being pulled to the other side
The other side
Our feelings need tonight and I'm flying towards the light
But it's just not right
It's just not right

[CHORUS:]
It's ridiculous (It's so unnatural)
I'm feeling so unnatural
I just want to give it up
I just wanna lose it
Now I live my life without your Ghost Love
(Ghost Love)

It's ridiculous (It's so unnatural)
I'm feeling so unnatural
And I just want to give it up
Just wanna lose it
Now I live my life without you being a Ghost Love

A Ghost Love (A Ghost Love)
Ah no no

[VERSE 2:]
I'm so moved by his touch
I'm so moved by his touch
And his arms I'm wrapped up
Feels so good but it's rough
To know he's not for real
And it ain't gonna be
Nothing but a mystery

[PRE CHORUS:]
Feels like I'm way passed the clouds
And being pulled to the other side
The other side
Our feelings need tonight and I'm flying towards the light
But it's just not right
It's just not right

[CHORUS:]
It's ridiculous (It's so unnatural)
I'm feeling so unnatural (Unnatural Love)
I just want to give it up
Just wanna lose it
Now I live my life without your Ghost Love
(Ghost Love)

It's ridiculous (It's so unnatural)
I'm feeling so unnatural (Unnatural Love)
I just want to give it up
Just wanna lose it
Now I live my life without you being a Ghost Love

[BRIDGE x2:]
Tell me what doing to me
Doing to me
Doing to me
You don't know what this does to me
Does to me 
Does to me
Tell me what you doing to me
This just not right for me
I don't want this 

Ghost Love

[CHORUS:]
It's ridiculous (It's so unnatural)
I'm feeling so unnatural (Unnatural Love)
I just want to give it up
I just wanna lose it
Now I live my life without your Ghost Love

It's ridiculous (It's so unnatural)
I'm feeling so unnatural (I don't wanna go)
I just want to give it up (give it up)
I just wanna lose it (lose it)
Now I live my life without you being a Ghost Love

[BRIDGE:]
Tell me what doing to me
Doing to me
Doing to me
You don't know what this does to me
Does to me 
Does to me
Tell me what you doing to me
This just not right for me
I don't want this 
GHOST LOVE
