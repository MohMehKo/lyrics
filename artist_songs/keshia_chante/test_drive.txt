I found myself drawn to you
Looking for something new
Only to find it was used
I was tired of waiting
Was looking to trade-in
You left me with not much to choose
You had me thinking of
How I'm a sucker for love
You were such a good sales man
I signed on the dotted line
Didn't take me much time
You had me sold

U wanted me so bad
Fallen for the best pitch that u had
Selling me what I don't have
(I was mistaken)
From the outside you looked so good
Shoulda double checked under that hood
Ey (I was just taken)

Is it too late to change lanes
(Feels like I'm going to fast)
Were driving on a one way
I knew I shoulda taken that test drive
test drive, test drive
Cause something didn't look right
Look right, look right
Should taken that test drive
Test drive, test drive
Something didn't feel right

Soon as I started the engine
It was a lemon
Won't make this mistake again
Red lights start blinkin
It got me thinking
What kinda mess am I in?
Feels like I'm riding on empty
U won't get the best of me
(Shoulda read my policy, policy)
Shoulda got me that warranty
Cause I got no guarantees
(I got no guarantees)

U wanted me so bad
Fallen for the best pitch that u had
Selling me what I don't have
(I was mistaken)
From the outside U looked so good
Shoulda double checked under that hood
Ey
(I was just taken)

test drive, test drive
Cause something didn't look right
Look right, look right
Should taken that test drive
Test drive, test drive
Something didn't feel right

When this car goes a blazing
me, you wont be taking down
before these tires get deflated
I wont be around
no, test drive

(Shoulda shoulda shoulda baby)
