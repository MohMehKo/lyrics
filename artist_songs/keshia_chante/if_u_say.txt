Eh ey, oh no no, yeah eh...

You promised me last night that things gonna change
Woke up this morning babe and things were just the same
Walking down the hallway and looking at the photographs
Looking at all the times you used to make me laugh

Now you gone and it's wrong
I'm in this kitchen cooking breakfast alone
It's so wrong cause you gone, I don't care

If you say you love me then just make it right
If you say you need me why we argue and fight
If you say you need me then just make it work
Just make it right, just make it right

Why am I still waiting for you at the front door
I got myself all dolled up, your favorite dress down to the floor
Its 9:45 wait, this reservations at 8
You couldn't even call me, to tell me you'd be late

And it's wrong, still not home
I'm in this kitchen cooking dinner alone
It's so wrong, you ain't home, I don't care

If you say you love me then just make it right
If you say you need me why we argue and fight
If you say you need me then just make it work
Just make it right, just make it right, just make it right, just make it right

Oh no, I'm sick of everything that you said oohh (always promising tomorrow)
Did you think that I'm the girl who would stay for you? (your promises are hollow)
I really don't know what to do ohh
I deserve much better than you

Now you home all alone
You're in the kitchen thinking where we went wrong
I'm so gone I'm so gone, I don't care 

If you say you love me then just make it right
If you say you love me why we argue and fight
If you say you need me then just make it work
Just make it right, just make it right
Just make it right, just make it right
Just make it right, just make it right
Just make it right, just make it right
