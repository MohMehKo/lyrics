[Verse 1:]
I gave you everything but was it enough
Can't believe how you neglected my love (wish I would see)
Wish I woulda seen you for who you are (baby I was just a foool)
Baby I was just a fool in love (what was I thinking of)

[Pre-Chorus:]
You say you, found somebody new (now you don't want me, noo ohh)
Hope she do, the same thing to you (I hope that she makes you)

[Chorus:]
Cry (cry), Cry (cry), Cryyyy cryyyyy
Cry (cry), Cry (cry), Cryyyy cryyyyy
Cry (cry), Cry (cry), Cryyyy cryyyyy
Cry (cry), Cry (cry), Cryyyy cryyyyy

[Verse 2:]
Never thought that we'd be where we are (nooooo)
Always thought that we would reach the stars (yeaa)
I guess you just weren't capable
Of being truly faithful
But it's all good cause now I know who you are

[Pre-Chorus:]
You say you, found somebody new (now you don't want me, noo ohh)
Hope she do, the same thing to you (I hope that she makes you...)

[Chorus:]
Cry (cry), Cry (cry), Cryyyy cryyyyy
Cry (cry), Cry (cry), Cryyyy cryyyyy
Cry (cry), Cry (cry), Cryyyy cryyyyy
Cry (cry), Cry (cry), Cryyyy cryyyyy

[Bridge:]
Think of everything you put me through
Now imagine you in the position but beings? onto you
Never thought that we would end this way
And I'm sorry babe but karma's coming back in the worst way
I know the vagant thing to do would be just to forgive you
But I'm sorry baby cause I already too
Now I hope you realize that telling me all those lies
Is gonna be the thing that's gonna (Make Ya)

[Chorus:]
Cry (cry), Cry (cry), Cryyyy cryyyyy
Cry (cry), Cry (cry), Cryyyy cryyyyy
Cry (cry), Cry (cry), Cryyyy cryyyyy
Cry (cry), Cry (cry), Cryyyy cryyyyy
