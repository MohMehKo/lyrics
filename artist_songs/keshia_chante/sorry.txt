Why you keep telling me that, 
You ain't never coming back, that's too hard to take, 
Can you at least hear me out first? 
Though you think that I'm the worst, I made a mistake 
I never thought I made you feel I didn't care, 
I know that I have hurt you,but you leaving just ain't fair 
Here is my apology 

I'm sorry, for ever thinking of myself 
Forgive me don't want you loving no one else 
Stay with me don't want to feel the way you felt 
Oh no,no,no,no 
I'm sorry, for ever thinking of myself 
Forgive me, don't want you loving no one else 
Stay with me, don't want to feel the way you felt 
Oh no,no,no,no, 

Your like nothing that I've had before, I love your name 
I have let you down and baby I'm the one to blame 
This letter that I've written isn't something that I do 
That's why you must believe,that I'm still in love with you 
This is my apology 

I can't think right 
My days seem night 
'Cause it's so cold 
And baby I know that 
Me alone ain't good 
I said, me alone ain't good 
I can't see straight 
Please heal my fate 
Don't run away 
I need you to stay cause 
Me alone ain't good 
I said, me alone ain't good 

Boy, I'm sorry, for ever thinking of myself 
Forgive me, don't want you loving no one else 
Stay with me, don't want to feel the way you felt 
Oh no no, no, no, no,no,no 
I'm sorry, for ever thinking of myself 
Forgive me, don't want you loving no one else 
Stay with me, don't want to feel the way you felt 
Oh no no, no,no,no,no
