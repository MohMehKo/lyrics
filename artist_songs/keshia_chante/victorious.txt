I'm on my own,on my own, in the middle in the middle of the universe
And noone's there to lend a hand, and I'm so so cold 
I'm in the race, in the race, with nothing there's no way I'm about to lose this
I'm the boss, yes gonna be first, I'll go journey that road

[Chorus]
There is only one life to win, one chance to win
One hill to climb, to prove that you're a champion
I'm gonna ride, no wind with the tide, does not horror, I will survive cause now 
I'm on top of the world, ain't no mountain I can't climb
Guess this is the final destination, I'm flying home victorious
I'm on top of the world, ain't no mountain I cant climb
Guess this is the final destination, I'm flying home victorious

I'm letting you know even if I fall down, I'mma get up off that get up off that
I'm flying home victorious, the journey is hard sometimes I wanna give up
Imma get up off that get up off that, I'm flying home victorious
Ohhh I'm on top of the world 

I'm almost there, almost there
The finishing line is just a mile away
I'm tired out, thirsty now, still moving on
I've come so far, come so far, like a pyramid I'm way too up to go back down
I hold my faith, make no mistake, I'm gon get that goal 

I'm on top of the world, ain't no mountain I can't climb
Guess this is the final destination, I'm flying home victorious
I'm on top of the world, ain't no mountain I cant climb
Guess this is the final destination, I'm flying home victorious

[Bridge]
I'm flying home victorious, flyin victorious
I made it through against all odds 

[Chorus out]
