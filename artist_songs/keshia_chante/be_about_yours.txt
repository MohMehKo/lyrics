Oooo whatchu want?
Tell me now before your time is up
Back on the wall posted up
You look too damn good to be tryna front
OoOo where's your game?
Sure looks like you got somethin' to say
Playing around I aint got all day
So come and take over me

[Bridge]
Grab my left and my right hip
Keep on and get me dip boy
Just go ahead and enjoy
Enjoy me so be about

[Chorus]
Be about yours, Imma be about (mine)
I know what I want so don't waste you (time)
If you aint tryna step to me or get wit me don't even show your face cause
I'm on a roll you can't hold me (back)
If you bring it on then i'm good with that
Tonight don't play around cause if you bout yours then it's going down

Yeah now you understanding
I know my looks was so demanding that you couldn't help yourself
You know it's always better with someone else
When you moving baby making me wanna just get crazy
The way you handling yours i'm sure
You'll have no problem with grabbing

[Bridge]

[Chorus 2x]
