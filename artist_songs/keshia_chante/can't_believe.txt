So good to finally 
Get where we need to be 
Cause I was so close to losing my mind 
Right now is the time 
Made for you and I to do whatever we would like 
Without a care or fear cause were in 

In a place that we always dreamed of 
Where we can breathe and be free with our love 
A place where we can clear our heads and forget about what 
everyone says 

I cant believe that we're finally here 
A zone that just cant be found anywhere 
Something so special that only we can share (i cant believe) 
I can't believe that were finally here 
It was well worth the wait my dear 
I'm so happy you got me flowing teams - of joy 

It's all overwhelming me 
To the point where I don't wanna leave 
But if I got to I justt wanna make sure 
We can always come back,always come back for me 
Of this blissful life,I always see when I close my eyes 
And the memories I have to remind me 
Keep me wanting to be 

[Bridge:] 
That's all I can say,cause I'm so happy 
(I'm so happy so happy finally) 
Thank you for making me so so happy 
I can't believe 

joy, mmm 
uh no no 
I cant believe
