[VERSE 1:]
You had me almost convinced that 
Something really special was about to happen 
In our lives ya ya you said that
But now it seems like you don't really mean what you were saying
You thought that you could play me
Thought you could have me hooked on you so easily 
Thought wrong ya you shoulda known that
This aint no chick
This aint no chick
That you should be messing with

[PRE CHORUS:]
You keep telling me that I'm the only one
You keep telling me that I'm the only one
You said that I'm the one
But I know that you mess around with just about everyone

[CHORUS x2:]
No I gotchu now
No I gotchu now
No I gotchu now where I want you 
It's all over now
All over now

[VERSE 2:]
Its too bad for you now you lost me 
So whats up with that running back looking for forgiveness
I moved on I hope you get there
I've already written you off of my list 
Crying trippin off now
