[Intro:]
A couple more commas richer
And I'm still mobbing with my niggas bruh
That's why they don't like us rolling deep to the club
Nigga, fuck yo club, nigga!
Wherever I'm at is the club, nigga!
Suck a dick! Swag. Swag
A$AP

[Verse 1: ASAP Rocky]
Toot that shoot that Glock 9
Jiggy nigga I'm 'bout mine
Pinky ring and my watch shine
Yo' bitch is calling my hotline
Wide buggy look cockeyed
Big pockets sit lop-side
Talk stupid get your mouth wired
We 'bout it 'bout it, and rowdy uhhh
Bitches all on my jock, huh?
Pretty nigga might stop time
Told y'all young niggas run this shit
Including red lights and stop signs
Asap niggas on the scene ha
Young trill niggas on my team ha
Serving fiends ah, bitches scream ha
See the beam ha, it's the nina

[Hook: ASAP Rocky]
Rocky where you been?
I've been thugging with my team ho
Rocky how you been?
I've been thugging with my team ho
Rocky where you been?
I've been thugging with my team ho
Rocky how you been?
I've been thugging with my team ho

[Verse 2: ASAP Rocky]
My trunk shake and my pink spill
Chrome lady with the grain wheel
Pussy niggas they ain't trill
And we toast to ricky cause he ain't here
A couple bad bitches every day chill
So much snow, need a reindeer
Thuggish Ruggish like St. Clair
Trill bitches wanna hop up on the thing, yeah

[Hook]
