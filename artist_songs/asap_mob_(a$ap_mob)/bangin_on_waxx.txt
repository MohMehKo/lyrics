[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
Yea

All of my bitches is rocking Givonny

Yea
Talk to me nice or don’t talk to me at all

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
This that fucking nigga, Fergen-stein
And I’m finna shine ‘cause a nigga on his grind
Sipping that lean and I’m finna lose my fucking mind
Kissing codeine and I fucking commit crime
See ya hear me? Niggas know with me! Bobby, Whitney, spit that crack
Got that Mac, in the back of the Acura black
As matter of fact, get them facts, right
Coming through with the fucking gun or the knife
Do you want your wife, do you want your life, tell me nigga
And I got that heater, you know that Tommy Hilfiger

Nasty back and I’m strapped with that mothafuckin’ A-K
Got this crack up in my, sock
And these coppers on my dick, they tryna catch me on the fucking block

I don’t give a damn about yo life so I’ma lay you in this fucking dirt
Now get in my hearse, should have got him a purse, niggas is pussy
I said it don’t push me, I’m all on my grind and they can’t overlook me
I style in my Stussy, hoes wanna do he
Like him in a suit be, come get at this coochie, I’m smelling like "ooo wee"
Rubbing yo booty while I’m smoking a loosie in my jacuzzi
I told that bitch, if you feel it, might be woozie, come and see me
I can hit it in a, in a movie, then I’m leaving
Out to my city, where I be breezing, I come through sneezing
Up on that track just how I do it, I’m speaking the fluent
You talking that shit, I’m one of the new kids, just spitting up fluid
Bitch
