[A$AP Ant:]
Young wild nigga, I'm high as hell
Break a whole pound down, smell the smell
Word around town, they ringing bells
All my niggas cracking, lock the shells
Sweat pants on with the YSL
Might go Dipset [?]
All white on, the light snow
In the summer time my fly glow
Some hate me, some love me though
Bitches on the guest list at my shows
In the mosh-pit throwing elbows
[?]
Poured all slow, don't catch the flow
Bum niggas want to steal my clothes
Thirsty niggas want to fuck my hoes
Run up on me meet the 44
Mobbing ten deep in the Tahoe
Drug money, rap money, more dough
Pots caught me but the wrist game
Rap don't work, flip cocaine
Do it for the money, do it for the fame
Don't love the hoes, let my bros run trains
Puffing on gas, lighting up the flame
City on my back like a campaign
Cross-over, slammed, that LeBron James
Peanut butter inside, wood grain
Pull up on your block like a goblin
All you see is guns, get to sparking
Then the police get to chalking
Dope in the car, no walk in
Outbid a nigga, no bargain (Nigga)

Young nigga living
Young nigga living
Fucking these bitches
Niggas ain't made for the stone cold
Niggas pull Ks for the co-co
I'ma just blaze with the 44
Stand back, blow haze in my low low
Catch a fade then I go go
Act right, then I fade to the slow-mo
That's right got a pay for the po-po
On the West got the drank for the low low
Bounce in my low low
Vision like a GoPro
Down Melrose, got about twelve hoes
In the Valley, I got about twelve more
Two twelve in the pell, give em' hell like you came from the twelfth floor
Got the bell, get the bands like a billfold
Where they at? Man I'm strapped like Velcro
Where I'm at I'ma bad in the hell hole
Where it's at matter fact who the hell knows
It's a fact that I rap and I move Os
Then the Act got me slapped, man I'm too slow
Then I'm trapped in a trap turn the two door
Porsche 911, shit too cold
Man I'm one then I'm done then it's new coach
Man 911, we don't do those

Young nigga living

Life's so hard
RIP Grandma
These cops play different
Every corner got a camera
I swear the game got a cancer
These lil niggas bust a hammer
White bitch my attendant
Seize, make her want to get a [?]
Ain't about gang bangers or color bandannas
Or holding your fist up and repping the panthers
See Willie still Lynching they want us to hang us
Game is still pimping adapted the changes
I'll take your 360, work off your anus
Shit on these niggas, like you constipated
See that's what I did
And Momma I made it
But I'm gone out my mind
And my point is vacated
I can't take this world
Ain't got the patience
Years of oppression, I'm feeling violated
And that's why my niggas be highly sedated
Addicted to money and driving the Ranges
Gone off the lean, want to stay faded
They can't even drink because their life is so jaded
I want to be clean but the world is so tainted
Ain't it?
