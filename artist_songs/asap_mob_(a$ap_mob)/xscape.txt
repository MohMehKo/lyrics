I'm feelin' like Puff back in '98
Bad Boy here, boost the crime rate
My hand good but the nine great
Fuck the law, nigga, crime pays
Can't tax dirty money
Thank the Lord for dirty money
Man, I used to be dead broke
Now my bank full of dead folks
Get the Benjis for my brothers
Grants for the bills and the Jacksons to my mother
Momma love kept me so clean
And I got it with the dope fiends
Now I'm tryna get my dough clean
Hoes scream when they get a glimpse of the whole team
In that Velour VLONE
A Nutcracker at the kingdom
"Work" banging on my ringtone
Whole team getting dough, she ain't even know
It's the year of that A$AP
Niggas slept on us now it's time for that payback

It's mad stress round here
Got my bulletproof vest and my Tec round here
I just wanna get away
But I can't get away
It's mad stress round here
Got my bulletproof vest and my Tec round here
I just wanna get away
But I can't get away

It's like my back's against the wall
See a nigga want it all, run the game with my dogs
See they praying that I fall
Another mural on the wall, front page of the Source
A blood stain on the floor
Another black boy lost, left slain in the Porsche
Man, they killed my nigga Stack B
I'm yelling, free my nigga Max B
Man, they killed that boy Trayvon
I got the right to carry firearms
Bill of Rights, I know my shit
Bunch of books and some loaded clips, tell the law
"Suck my dick"
Free my nigga S-1
And Remy too, for them 2 I'm a wreck, son
Light somethin', know a nigga stressed
Know a nigga blessed, gotta get this shit up off my chest
Fuck the rest, cause when sun is set
I'mma burnin'[?] that then kill some clowns with my loaded Tec
Trigger happy, nigga nappy head peasy
Motherfucker, be easy motherfucker, ha

It's mad stress round here
Got my bulletproof vest and my Tec round here
I just wanna get away
But I can't get away
It's mad stress round here
Got my bulletproof vest and my Tec round here
I just wanna get away
But I can't get away
I just wanna get away
But I can't get away
It's mad stress round here
But I can't get away
It's mad stress round here
Got my bulletproof vest and my Tec round here
I just wanna get away
But I can't get away
There's no way out
There's no way out
There's no way out
Wanna get away
But I can't get away
