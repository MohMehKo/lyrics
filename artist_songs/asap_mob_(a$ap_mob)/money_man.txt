I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma ride
I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma ride
All that I wanted man
Bring me some money man
Look at my wallet man
Countin' the hunnids
Call me the money man
She do the money dance
I keep the money man
Keep it one hunnid

Cash rules everything around me
Nigga ask about me
I swear my shooters be my juniors call me Robert Downey
He held it down, he held his own
Now holding down the county
It just so happen now, she wet and now i'm all outta Bounty
I'm the quicker, picker upper
Still don't give no fucks bruh
Quick to pick her up
I be that pretty mothafucker
For fuckin' up my cash on Ubers
Time to switch the truck up
Tip the driver
Turn the Future up, fuck up some commas
Homicide, pussy good, eat it good, treat it good
Beat it good, peck a wood, wish you could
Love a ride, ride or die
Ride it backfroth, side to side
Make it shake, surfboard
Make a nigga go dumb for it
I'ma ride, I'ma ride
Love the bitch 'till I die
Genuine, Bonnie Clyde
We gon' die, Homicide
Suicide, two of us
You and I, crucified
Truths and lies, you despise
I'm the best, you decide

I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma ride
I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma ride
Choose a side, suicide
You and I, crucified
You despise
I'm the best, you decide

[A$AP Nast:]
Pull up on lil shawty
Hello, howdy, howdy

Told that hoe don't come I ain't got no times for phonies, uhh
I've been gettin' money, Why you niggas fronting?
Flacko told me "fuck 'em", I'm like "nah let's buck 'em"
I ain't got no time, these niggas want discussion
Told her drop that ass, I ain't tryna fuck you
I just bought a stripper pole
I put it in my bed room
Got your hoe plus several more sliding down the metal
666 off in your bitch
She call my dick the devil
She like "nasty baby demon", yeah that boy a rebel
