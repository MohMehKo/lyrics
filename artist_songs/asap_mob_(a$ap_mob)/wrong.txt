[A$AP Rocky:]
La Musica de Harry Fraud
I know it's wrong
I know it's wrong

Father please forgive us
Couldn't tell the difference and it's on me
I don't need to seek attention
Just to keep these womens on me
I know it's wrong
I know it's wrong
[A$AP Ferg:]
I know it's wrong
I know it's wrong

Fuckin' on that bitch and I know it's wrong
Wifey walked in and she found that thong
She talk to my dick like an intercom
Then smoke that dick up just like it's a bong
I ain't gon' lie, this the realest song
Hit Ben Baller, get my glisten on
Trap Lord been gettin' his ceiling on
But I know it's wrong
I know that it's wrong so the boy pray
I speak to the Lord, don't ignore me
White model bitch doin' cocaine
Layin' her out in the hallway
Double strappin' on a ratchet bitch
So she don't take me to Maury
Man I done lost me a classy bitch
Fergie is learning the hard way

[A$AP Rocky:]
Father please forgive us
Couldn't tell the difference and it's on me
I don't need to seek attention
Just to keep these womens on me
I know it's wrong
I know it's wrong
[A$AP Ferg:]
I know it's wrong
I know it's wrong

Feel like I'm stuck in a maze, my bitches lookin' amazed
Now she is goin' so crazy, she caught me cheatin' today
Eyelashes all on my bed, texts I didn't erase
Now she comin' at my head, thought I'd never see the day
Shouldn't have never been with them other broads
And now I left my girl with another scar
Sometimes I take advantage just 'cause I'm a star
I know it's wrong so I'm on my knees prayin' to God

[A$AP Rocky:]
Father please forgive us
Couldn't tell the difference and it's on me
I don't need to seek attention
Just to keep these womens on me
I know it's wrong
I know it's wrong
[A$AP Ferg:]
I know it's wrong
I know it's wrong
