Put that on my set, uhh, uhh
Put that on my set
I recollect, uhh, uhh
Time to count some checks and go collect, uhh
They owe some debt
Nothin' over, nothin' less
And hoes on deck, and plus I flex
I put that on my set

Understand, I'm a man tryna make it in the world today
She just wanna fuck and I just met her at the club
And now we left
I just wanna fuckin' love her, rough her
She was lovin' nothin' less
I just love how we're bustin' nothin' more than fucking chest
God I love that dress, god I love the way she dress, she fresh
God I love her breasts, god I love her thighs and eyes and uhh
Swear to god I'm outta breath
Swear to god if I get out of line, she checkin'
Only time we naked, only time she complain and didn't demand for private jets
Twist my fingers, put that on my set
Fuck that other side no disrespect, uhh
Stack of crazy niggas
Comin' at my neck
Man that's word to Skepta
I'ma put that on my set

[Skepta:]
Show respect, I'ma aim for the neck
I'ma make some ghosts
When it comes to the raps
Man I must be possessed when you see me up close
When you look into my eyes
When you see how I flex, just me and my dogs
And another handful of cats
I ain't tryna fuck with the rest
Man, I'm ready to die
My soul's in the sky
See the pain in my eyes
I don't wanna cry, put my life on the line
For my blood all the time
I see all the signs, but it's like that nine
Tryna kill me for mine
Now this all behind, the police tryna find
DNA on the 9
Man, open the door
Real niggas on tour
Man, I'm ready for war
Ten toes on the floor
Fuck with me on the 3rd, It will be Halloween on the 4th
Yeah, all the way from the East to the North
Rocky rollin' up that Backwood
Spilling mad weed on the floor
Ice me

[A$AP Rocky:]
Eyy, eyy
Put that on my set
I said, I flex
Eyy, eyy
What's that on my neck?
Eyy, eyy
Put that on my set
I said, I flex
Eyy, eyy
What's that on my neck?
These bitches flex
