[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
She was coming on to me, I was coming on to her
Hit the town and shoot the breeze, baby don’t you fight because
She was making love to me, I was holding on to her
Hit the town and shoot the breeze, baby don’t you fight because
Ah just give me that bass she listenin' to Ross now give me that face
I ain’t tryin to chase tryna get the third base
Till I head the home run 321 we safe
Damn she a looka, ran outta liquor
Sweet sweet pusha, give me that gusha
I ain’t tryin spit game maybe we can hook up
The Aston out front, so my nickname Kutcher
Then the day town stay nine
I’m in the state of mine like the dinner date's fine
We can go to the condo and drink wine
She want to be my girl but it'll take time
She like where the cognac why we drink wine
’cause the wine get you open heard through the grape vines
First dim the lights close the drape blinds
Then I scratch that kitty word to my K-9's
Don’t spur show fur bitch real we greemin
Po learn no firm when the ship season
Got em red bottoms look like your heels bleeding
I fuck the hundred bitches to these day we still speaking
And he still creeping, got em still cheatin
