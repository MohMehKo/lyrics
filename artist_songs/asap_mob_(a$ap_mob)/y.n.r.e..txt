A$AP!...

Man I'm feeling like rich with the duffle
Bricks on the shelf
Yams like 12 you better stay out of trouble
Crew is paid in full
No snitch in the huddle
A$AP mob
Money mixed with the muscle
Dollars falling from the sky
Harlem on the rise
On some Spartan shit
You don't want no problems with these guys
I know I'm smiling though
How I get you bodied in your ride
Check the calendar
Got this shit feeling like July
But I'm cool though
Graduated school though
Don't sip nouveau
That never been cool though
Fuck it I'm a fool though
New after new flow
Twelvyy bout his cudos
I'm live from the group home
Hardknocks & seeing the bigger picture
Plan is to get richer
Or kill them with the scriptures
So fuck them other niggas
Cause they ain't fucking with my niggas

All my niggas throw they hands up
See we sinning and winning
Fuck it we living
But you gotta keep the vision
All my niggas getting paper
Cause we hustle and shit
Young niggas just running this shit

All my niggas throw they hands up
See we sinning and winning
Fuck it we living
But you gotta keep the vision
All my niggas getting paper
Cause we hustle and shit
Young niggas just running this shit

Man I'm gunning for the top
Million niggas deep
Strapped with heat
Watch how we occupy the streets
For the least and the maximum
All the g's jacking them
And I keep the calcium
And I'm known for blasting them
So stop harassing them, about
Bitches and his rapper friends, dog
What you feeling man
That queer shit is sickening
All about my benjamins
Oh shit it's him again
All black timbaland
Y'all little niggas feminine
Y'all ain't getting dividends
Man I got racks to get
Man I got racks to spend
I'm fake on some rapper shit
I'm caught in the loop, straight from the stoop
To the booth, next stop a coupe, I'm the truth
What it do
Why they let this young nigga loose
I'm the truth, this is what I do in the booth
Man I have fun, and I spaz on everything
Cause young niggas run everything
A$AP!...
