[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Medusa faces turn me into stone
Versace killas and Raff murdering Dior hoes
My skinny niggas fuckin' bring the chrome
The only thing I'm killin' is a microphone, now let my little niggas take you home
One straight to the dome, better ring the alarm, Fergy's home
Ever taste the chrome? Way far from a silver spoon
Sing yo lullabies, watch yo mother and yo brother cry
Fuck yo sister brains, cause a mental homicide
Mothafuck yo life, fuck yo family nigga, fuck yo wife
I be down for life (A$AP) those my brothers for life
Big money, talk to me knots, talk to me nice or don't talk to me at all
Grippin' that MAC now he grippin' the floor, rat-tat-tat-tat let it split through yo jaw
Laid on your back, whispering Lord, then he couldn't see his death
Berettas under the leather, he couldn't see this Tec
Teflon vest for those who test
A bunch of niggas gettin' throwed, call me Jazzy Jeff

[Hook: x2]
I got these choppas on deck, and the 9 is on deck
And the Llamas on deck, just in case you ain't heard what I said
I got these choppas on deck, and the 9 is on deck
And the Llamas on deck, just in case you ain't heard what I said

[Verse 2:]
I'm drowning these niggas, no coroner with me, in Vitamin Water like Formula 50
I'm pipin' yo daughter mothafucka come get me, one clip to the brain, gone in a jiffy
I'm pipin' yo dame, cum on her titties, beef lo mein all in a?
Oodles and noodles hangin' out his fitted, somebody done died, who knows who done did it
Somebody gon' ride, bangin' with the Smith'n, now it's Men in Black, I will Will Smith him
Semi-automac, brrat it will lift him, preacher gon' sing, momma gon' listen
He was on that bullshit, Jordan on Pippen, so I had to pull shit, feeling so tempting
Rocks on his socks, Shawshank Redemption, somebody gon' die, who know who done did it
