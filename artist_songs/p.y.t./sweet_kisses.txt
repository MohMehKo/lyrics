As I walk with him
I'm feeling something different
The way he looks
The way he smiles
The way he listens
He ain't the flyest guy I know
Let's just let the record show
The boy's got style
The boy's got class
Always says something to make me laugh

I ain't looking for no guy who thinks he's too cool
I don't want no one
To play me for a fool
What I'm looking for
I found is so delicious
All I really need is

[CHORUS:]
Sweet sweet kisses
Every moment I'm awake
Sweet sweet kisses
Every promise that I make
Sweet sweet kisses
Every star up in the sky
Sweet kisses
Your sweet kiss I can't deny

As I'm going through oh so many changes
One thing in my life remains the same
He's the only one I'm dreaming of
Never have to tell him to show me love
The boy's got class
The boy's got style
Always says something to make me smile

I ain't looking for no guy who thinks he's too cool
I don't want no one
To play me for a fool
What I'm looking for
I found is so delicious
All I really need is

[REPEAT CHORUS]

You've got something special any fool could see
You've been number one from the start
If by chance you ever have to leave
You will always stay in my heart

Sweet sweet kisses (sha la la la la la)
Sweet sweet kisses (sha la la la la la)
Sweet sweet kisses (sha la la la la la)
Sweet kisses (sha la la la la la)

I ain't lookin' for no guy who thinks he's too cool
I don't want no one 
To play me for a fool
What I'm looking for
I found is so delicious
All I really need is

Sweet sweet kisses (sha la la la la la)(your kiss is so sweet)
Sweet sweet kisses (sha la la la la la)(oh so sweet)
Sweet sweet kisses (sha la la la la la)(oh your kiss is so delicious)
Sweet kisses (oh so sweet)(sha la la la la la)

Sweet sweet kisses (sha la la la la la)(every moment I'm awake)
Sweet sweet kisses (sha la la la la la)(every promise that I make)
Sweet sweet kisses (sha la la la la la)(every star up in the sky)
Sweet kisses (sha la la la la la)
