Yeah Yeah Yeah Owww Oww hmmm hmmm

First time you said that you were leaving
I cried cause you said you didn't need me
But the second that I started seeing somebody else
It's when ya had to come back to me
(gone) continued moving now I'm better
I moved on
To someone who would treat me better
But now you're tripping cause you see I ain't all by myself
And you won't let be me boy

[CHORUS:]
Why you gonna call me on my phone?
Everytime you see another boy at my door
Oh boy you should've thought of that before
And now you wanna come home
And you're alone
It's the Same Ol' Same Ol' sad scenario
Everytime you say you wanna be so low
Oh boy you should've never let me go
But you've done it before
And now I know it's the Same Ol' Same Ol'

Oh
You thought that you could keep on dreaming
This too you think that I won't keep on moving
I admit it for a minute
You was having your way
What can I say?
I wasn't over you (oh no)
Things change you and me
Best forget it (no more games)
No more playing I ain't with it
Don't you get it boy
you did it, now you're trying to stay like it was yesterday
But boy
But you never really ever cared about me
Cause if you ever really cared about me
Then it wouldn't take another man
To make you understand
That you want me (oh)
Cause if you really ever cared about me
You wouldn't ever broken my heart, left me
And now you wanna come back and call me up

[CHORUS:]
Why you gonna call me on my phone?
Everytime you see another boy at my door
Oh boy you should've thought of that before
And now you wanna come home
And you're alone
It's the Same Ol' Same Ol' sad scenario
Everytime you say you wanna be so low
Oh boy you should've never let me go
But you've done it before
And now I know its the Same Ol' Same Ol'

[BRIDGE:]
I told you (I told you)
I'd leave ( you know I told you)
(I told you I would leave you)
Next time (and it's the last time boy)
Boy boy boy you were told lets get it on
It's the Same Ol' Same Ol' Same Ol' Same Ol'
Boy boy boy you were told lets get it on
It's the Same Ol' Same Ol' Same Ol' Same Ol'

[CHORUS:]
Why you gonna call me on my phone?
Everytime you see another boy at my door
Oh boy you should've thought of that before
And now you wanna come home
And you're alone
It's the Same Ol' Same Ol' sad scenario
Everytime you say you wanna be so low
Oh boy you should've never let me go
But you've done it before
And now I know its the Same Ol' Same Ol'
