All alone, all alone
No one to play with
Your eyes are all swollen from crying, hmm

Feeling sick
You open it
And discover your lover
Between the legs of another
And he's lovin' it

Let me lie to you
Let me lie to you
I'll be kind, kind when I deceive you
You must never question me
Quietly believe

There, there
You haven't a care
I won't ever hurt you, deny or desert you

Don't ask me again
Wake up and listen to the thee
Someone must have told you
Someone must control you
Before you can get free

Let me lie to you
I'll be kind, kind when I deceive you
You must never question me
Quietly believe

All alone, all alone
No one to play with
No one to play with
No one to play with
