Baby
Don't make me worry aboutcha
You look so sad
What you do to make you so blue?

I have to ask you, where do you go?
You look so far away sometimes
I don't know, where do you go?
I wanna go

Miles away, miles above
The vampire only wants a little love
You might be right, you might be
Everything that you said that you were, but so?

Baby
Don't make me worry aboutcha
They say that goodbye
Arrives by design

Who do you think about
When you're lonely?
I remember when
You used to sing about your one an' only

You're such a phony, now I finally know
You really know me

Miles away, miles above
The vampire only wants a little love
A little love, a little more
He's got you now
You're gone for sure
Gone for sure
Gone for sure
Gone for sure
You know now
You know
