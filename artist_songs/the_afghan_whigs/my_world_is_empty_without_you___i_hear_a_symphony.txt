My world is empty without you, babe
My world is empty without you, babe
And as I roam my way alone
I find it hard for me to carry on
I need your strength, I need your tender touch
I need the love, my dear, I miss so much
My world is empty without you, babe
My world is empty without you, baby

You've given me a true love
And every day I thank you, love
For the feeling that's so new
So exciting so inviting
Baby, baby, I hear a symphony
A tender melody
Pushing me closer and closer to your heart
Then suddenly
Your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine
Til I leave my past behind

My world is empty without you, babe
My world is empty without you, babe
From this cold world I try to hide my face
But from this loneliness there ain't no hiding place
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell
In darkness, in memory I know so well
My world is empty without you, babe
My world is empty without you, babe
Without you babe Without you babe...
