If I stepped it off
Walked outside your trance
Crawled inside your mind
And got my hands into your pants

Wouldn't that beat all
Wouldn't that be great
And all the things you do to me
We could exaggerate

Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh

Now everybody knows
Or everybody wants to know
The hows, the whens, the whys
Of how I said goodbye

Oooooooh
Oooooooh

Don't forget the alcohol
Ooh baby ooh baby
Don't forget the alcohol
Ooh baby ooh baby
Don't forget the alcohol
Ooh baby ooh baby

Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby

If I stepped it off
Walked outside your trance
Crawled inside your mind
And got my hand into your pants

Oooooooh
Oooooooh

Don't forget the alcohol
Ooh baby ooh baby
Don't forget the alcohol
Ooh baby ooh baby
Don't forget the alcohol
Ooh baby ooh baby
Don't forget the alcohol
Ooh baby ooh baby

Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
