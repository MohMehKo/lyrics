Ladies, let me tell you about myself
I got a dick for a brain
And my brain is gonna sell my ass to you
Now I'm OK, but in time I'll find I'm stuck
'Cause she wants love, and I still want to fuck

Now that I'm ashamed, it burns
But the weight is off
Now that you're out of the way
I turn and I can walk
You showed no sympathy, my love
And this was no place for you and me to walk alone

On my grave, am I OK?
I'm sure I'm not

Ladies let me tell you about my love
She kept giving me more
But it wasn't enough
So understand
Now that I come to you
To understand my little self
To understand my little self

And Baby you be sweet, be sweet, be sweet
And Baby you be sweet, be sweet, be sweet
And Baby you be sweet, be sweet, be sweet
And Baby you be sweet, be sweet, be sweet
