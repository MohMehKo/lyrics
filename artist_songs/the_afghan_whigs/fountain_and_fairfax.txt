Angel, I'm sober
I got off that stuff
Just like you asked me to
Angel, come closer
So the stink of your lies
Sinks into my memory

She said baby, forever, 
But I don't like to be alone
So don't stay away too long
Now baby, forever, 
Well it's Tuesday now
I hear him breathing inside of her

Let me drink
Let me tie off
I'm really slobbering now
Let it stink
Let it dry up
Is it impossible how

Angel, forever
Don't you promise me
What you cannot deliver
Angel, together
I'll be waiting for you 
On Fountain and Fairfax

Let me drink
Let me tie off
I'm really slobbering now
Let me stink
Let it dry up
Is it impossible how

Let it stink

Let it dry up

Dry up, dry up
