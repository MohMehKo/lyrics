Yea
I walk around with this all over me
I cannot wash it clean
You've got the ball
You've got the ball I'm takin' it from you

And today
It's in the blood
I left it in the blood you see
So put the words together
I'll be with you forever

Get up, we'll rise, they'll pay, get up
We'll rise and wait until tomorrow night
I can't wait recall yet if I'm black
Or if I'm white or wrong, oh
Or if I'm white or wrong

I am your creator
Come with me my congregation
Get up, I'll smack your back down
Get up, we'll rise, they'll pay

Get up, I'll smack your back down
You will become my diamond
I'm yours and you are mine

Get up, we'll rise
And wait until tomorrow night
I can't wait recall yet if I'm black
Or if I'm white or wrong
Or if I'm white or wrong

Get up, we'll rise, they'll pay
Get up, we'll rise, they'll pay
Get up, we'll rise
