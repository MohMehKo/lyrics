Sit back and count your fingers
What else is there to do?
Oh honey I know how you feel
I know you feel like you're through
Sit back, count, count your little fingers
My unhappy, little, little girl

Sit back
Gonna count those raindrops
Feel it falling down all around you
Honey don't you know it's time somebody told you
Cause you got to know
All you ever gonna have to count on
I'm gonna want to lean on
It's gonna feel just like those raindrop do
When they're falling down
Baby, all around you
Well I know you're unhappy

Now you sit back
Gonna count your little fingers
What else do you have to do?
And I know how you feel
And I know you ain't got no reason to go on
And I know you feel like you must be dreaming
Honey go back and sit right back down
I want you to count on me
My unhappy, my unlucky, and my little, little girl
I know you're unhappy baby
Honey I know
