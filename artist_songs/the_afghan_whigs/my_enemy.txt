I hear the whispers, baby
If what they say is true
They say I killed the brother
To fall in love with you

These words I heard them once before
A conversation I believe
How does a man begin to fall
When he does practice to deceive?

It was a voice behind my back
His face I could not see it clear
The voice was so familiar, though
I knew my enemy was near
I knew my enemy was near

The sun is gone and the sky is black
So get your ass out from behind my back
I told you once and I told you all
And I told it like it was

You can't have me if you can't catch me
Out of your mind bent on revenge
To think I once called you my friend
You want the dog? I'll let him out
Come and get some baby
Come and get some baby

The sun is gone and the sky is black
So get your ass out from behind my back
I told you once and I told you all
And I told it like it was
I told it like it was, I told it like it was
