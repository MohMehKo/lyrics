Are you back in my life to stay
Or is it just for today
oh that you need me
If its a thrill you're lookin for
well honey I am flexible
oh yeah

Just....
Be for real
wont you baby
Be for real
wont you baby
you see I, I dont want, to be hurt by love again

You can understand baby, can't you?

Now you see I am not naive
but I would like to believe
oh what you tell me
So don't give me the world today
and then tomorrow take it away
don't do that to me darling

No....
Be for real
wont you baby
Be for real
wont you baby
You see I, I dont want, to be hurt by love again

Be for real
wont you baby
Be for real
wont you baby
You see I, I dont want, to be hurt by love again

Because I, dont want, to be hurt by love again
