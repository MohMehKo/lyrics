Up all night again as for sleep no comprende
I don't sleep 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Least that's what Nas say, sleep is a state of mind
And to know is to be on your way
I bought some bad drugs off these snotty little rave kids I met
And shuffled off to Buffalo

If I have love then I hide it
And the people that I hide it from have helped me to deny
That it's not enough baby to show you care
You gotta take on every double cross
And every double dare, I swear to you

Unchain your mind, become divine
Surrender, surrender my love
And get on down here and stay with me baby, yeah, yeah, yeah
Unchain your mind, become divine
Surrender, surrender to me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sick and tired again, fucked and wired again
It's all so beautiful sound like a stone temple sob story to me
If I'm on your mind again
You must be trippin' on some of that voodoo I've been throwin' down
When you're high and lost in the clouds
Then you know oh, it's time to get down again

Unchain your mind, become divine
Surrender, surrender my love
Get on down here and say with me yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Unchain your mind, become divine
Surrender, surrender to me
Get on down, sing with me child
And say yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
