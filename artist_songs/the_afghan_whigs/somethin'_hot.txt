I got your phone number, baby
I'll call you sometime
I think I might, be out tonight
Maybe give you a ride

Cocktails for two, down lover's lane
I wantcha so bad, after tonight
I'll never walk the same
And you're to blame

I wanna getcha high
I wanna get next to you
I wanna feel everything
I wanna feel, I wanna feel good

You make me feel good, baby, you don't know
Just how I lie awake
And dream awhile, about your smile
And the way you make your ass shake

If that ain't love
I guess I'll never know
A sweeter lie, you'd be surprised
Just how far I'd go to make it so

I wanna getcha high
I wanna get next to you
I wanna feel everything aboutcha, girl
I wanna feel good
You make me feel good, baby

I wanna getcha high
I wanna get next to you
I wanna feel everything aboutcha, girl
I wanna feel good
You make me feel good

You make me feel good
I wanna feel good
You make me feel good
I wanna feel good
I wanna feel good
I wanna feel good
I wanna feel good
I wanna feel good
