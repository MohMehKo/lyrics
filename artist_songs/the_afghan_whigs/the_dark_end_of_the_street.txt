At the dark end of the street
That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong
You and me at the dark end of the street
You and me

I know time is gonna take its toll
We have to pay for what we stole
It's a sin, and we know it's wrong
But our love keeps coming on strong
Steal away to the dark end of the street

And when the daylight hour rolls around
If by chance we should walk downtown
If we should meet, just walk on by
Ooooh darling, please don't cry
Tonight we'll meet at the dark end of the street
You and me

They're gonna find us
They're gonna find us
They're gonna find us
Oooooh, some day
You and me at the dark end of the street
You and me
