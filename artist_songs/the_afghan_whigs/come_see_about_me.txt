I've been cryin'
(for you)
cuz I'm lonely
tmiles have all turned to tears
tears won't wash away the fear

That you're never ever gonna return
to ease that fire that within me burns
it keeps me cryin' baby for you
keeps me sighing baby for you
(for you)
won't you hurry
come one
and see about me 
(come see about me) 
see about your baby
(come see about me)

I've given up my French dress
(for you) 
your friends are talkin
you have too
no more piece of my pie
until you come back and be mine

No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you anyways
it keeps me cryin' 
(baby, for you)
I'm gonna keep sighin'
(baby, for you)
won't you hurry
come one
and see about me
(come see about me)
(come see about me)
see about your baby


Sometimes up
sometimes down
my life's so unsanctified with you not around
from arms you maybe out of reach
but my love says you're here to keep 
it keeps me cryin' 
(baby, for you)
I'm gonna keep sighin'
(baby, for you)
won't you hurry
come one
and see about me
(come see about me)
see about your baby
(come see about me)
see about your baby
hurry hurry
hurry hurry
