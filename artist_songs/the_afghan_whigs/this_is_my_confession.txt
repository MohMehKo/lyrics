This is my confession Angel
Let's not make too much about it
This is my confession Angel
Let's not make too much about it

Don't say a word
Don't do a thing
Lock yourself inside my dear
This is what I mean

I'm lyin' now I always do
I know my way around the truth
My need for guilt demands fresh fuel
You've laid your trip upon me now
Won't you take me with you

And it was all just meat to me
You was all just meat to me
And it was all just meat to me

This is my confession Angel
Let's not make too much about it
This is my confession Angel
Let's not make too much about it

Don't say a word
Don't do a thing
Don't you move a muscle
Worship silence as your king
Hide in the dark
Block out the light
Tricked into believing that the dog wouldn't bite

And it was all just meat to me
And it was all just meat to me
You was all just meat to me
And it was all just meat to me
