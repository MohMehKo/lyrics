Whatever did happen to your soul?
I heard you sold it
To some old boy who lived uptown
Who could afford it
So what's gonna happen to you now?
Therapy, pharmacy

Crazy
That's what you'd like to believe
But it ain't easy when you're goin' crazy
Over the rainbow

"I think your story's jive," she said
There ain't nothin' wrong with me
If I use it to get me some sympathy
Some ecstasy, a memory
I wanna remember me

Crazy
That's what you'd like to believe
But it ain't easy when you're goin' crazy
Over the rainbow

Crazy, crazy
Crazy over you

Crazy about you
Crazy without you
Crazy over you
