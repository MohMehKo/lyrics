I knew a girl, extraordinary
Suggested something, unsanitary
As I asked her for a moment to consider her kind offer
She blew a kiss and said to me

"I know, you want it so
I want it too, so see it through
'Coz when I do what I'm gonna do to you
Make sure you remember my name"

You know it's true, I want it too
I know you know, so make it so
'Coz when I do what I'm gonna do to you
You'll never ever, ever

Intoxicated by your aggression
I offer you my one possession
You can fuck my body, baby
But please, don't fuck my mind

You know it's true, I want it too
I know you know, so make it so
'Coz when I do what I'm gonna do to you
You'll never ever, you'll never ever

You know it's true, I want it too
I know you know, so make it so
'Coz when I do what I'm gonna do to you
You'll never ever, ever

Get you high, girl, come with me
Take a ride in search of ecstasy
I wanna roll, I wanna roll

I feel you now, I never knew
You were so sad, I'll make it up to you
'Coz I feel you now

I feel you now
I feel you now
I feel you now
I feel you now

I feel you now
I feel you now
I feel you now
I feel you now

I feel you now
