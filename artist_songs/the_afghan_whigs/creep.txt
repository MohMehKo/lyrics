The 22nd of loneliness
and we've been through so many thangs
I love my girl with all honesty
But I know she's cheatin' on me
I look her in the eyes 
but all she tells me are lies that keep me near
I'll never leave her down 
though I might mess around 
it's only 'cause I need some affection

So I creep yeah
Just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep yeah
'Cause she doesn't know what I do
and no attention goes to show 

The 23rd of loneliness
And we don't talk like we used to do
Now it seems pretty strange 
but I'm not buggin' 
'cause I still feel the same yeah yeah
I'll keep giving loving
Till the day she pushes me away
Never go astray
If she knew the things I did
She couldn't handle it
So I choose to keep her protected

So I creep yeah
Just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep yeah
'Cause she doesn't know what I do
and no attention goes to show 

I creep around because I need attention
Don't mess around with my affection
I creep around because I need attention
Don't mess around
Oh I oh I oh I oh I baby
Oh I oh I oh I oh I yeah
Oh I oh I oh I oh I baby
Oh I oh I oh I oh I yeah
