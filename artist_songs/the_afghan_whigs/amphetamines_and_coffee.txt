Hey, man what is that you're thinkin'
Maybe you can get away
There must be lots of pressure
And lots of bills to pay

Amphetamines and coffee
It almost makes you gag
Too many big decisions
No more time to play

Slip into something classic
Turn on the television
Ignoring all your children
Accepting their derision

Routine is acknowledged
With pinnacle precision
The statistician stares at
A family in division, hey

Amphetamines and coffee
Amphetamines and coffee
Amphetamines and coffee
It almost makes you gag
