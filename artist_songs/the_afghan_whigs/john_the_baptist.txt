Hey, welcome home
I got a little wine
Some marvin gaye
Come on and taste me
Come on and take me, I'm yours

Dance, little sister, dance
This is my girl you're talkin' to
There isn't anythin' I wouldn't do
So take me, so taste me, erase me
I'm yours let's get it on

Anythin' for a lover
Anythin' for a friend
I only wanna see you happy
Baby can we pretend
I'd give anythin' to see you dance
I'd give anythin' to see you smile
Baby, doesn't want just anythin'
She wants everythin'

Hey welcome home
I got a little wine
I got a little time
So come on take me
Come on taste me
Come on and waste me
Come on and erase me
I'm yours let's get it on

Anythin' for a lover
Anythin' for a friend
I only wanna see you happy
Baby can we pretend
I'd give anythin' to see you dance
I'd give anythin' to see you smile
But baby doesn't want just anythin'
She wants everythin'

I've got the devil in me, girl
I've got the devil in me, girl
I've got the devil in me, girl

Everything for the lover
Everything for the lover
