"My temple should be a house of prayer"
Some have made it, getout
My time is almost through
Oh no

See my eyes I can hardly see
See me stand I can hardly walk
I believe you can make me whole
See my tongue I can hardly talk
See my skin I'm a mass of blood
See my legs I can hardly stand
I believe you can make me well
See my purse I'm a poor poor man

(Ooh)
Will you touch will you mend me Christ
(Ooh)
Won't you touch will you heal me Christ
(Ooh)
Won't you kiss you can cure me Christ
(Ooh)
Won't you kiss won't you pay me Christ
(Ooh)

See my eyes I can hardly see
(Ooh)
See me stand I can hardly walk
(Ooh)
I believe you can make me whole
(Ooh)
See my tongue I can hardly talk
(Ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
