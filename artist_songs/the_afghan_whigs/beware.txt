The way people smile and say,
Using me in every way
It's okay

Times are changing
Life is upside down
No reason to cry now
Oh no reason to cry now

Beware of who you listen to
Beware of what you believe
Ain't nothing I can do to you
To make you love me

Friends are the reason 
For so many breakups and breakdowns, round town
So many people think that life is so much fun
We've only just begun
Begun to have some fun

Beware of who you listen to
Beware of who you believe
Ain't nothing I can do to you
To make you love me

Beware of who you listen to
Beware of what you believe
Ain't nothing I can do to you
To make you love me

To make you love me
