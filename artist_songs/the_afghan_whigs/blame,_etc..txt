My lust it ties me up in chains
My skin catches fire at the
Mention of your name
No matter what I tried to do
I could not lose it

Now I know my heart is being used
But what I'm not allowed to have
I never could refuse
No matter what I tried to do
I stood accused

But I reply, that I don't believe
I'm ever gonna die, I don't
Do you?

Blame, deny, betray, divide
A lie, the truth, which one shall I use?
Whatcha gonna do? I know
Whatcha gonna do? I know
I know, I know

Your sanctimony is showing my dear
The acrimony hangs in the air
Beware of who you trust in this world
Beware the lies about
To unfurl

I reply, that I don't believe
I'm ever gonna die, I don't
Do you?

You were blind
But you are not alone in this
As I was once
Like you

Blame, deny, betray, divide
A lie, the truth, which one will I use?
Whatcha gonna do? I know
Whatcha gonna do? I know
Whatcha gonna do? I know
Whatcha gonna do? I know
I know, I know, I know
