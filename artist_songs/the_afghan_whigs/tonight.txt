Hey, baby there's a vampire moon
Scaling the sky, shining your room
Your eyes are open, you got nothing to do
Come outside and play with me
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Follow me down to the bushes dear
No one will know, we'll disappear
I'll hold your hand, we'll never tell
Our private little trip to hell
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Can I walk you home?
Can I walk you home?
Can I walk you home tonight?
Can I walk you home?
Can I walk you home?
Can I walk you home tonight?
Tonight, tonight, tonight
