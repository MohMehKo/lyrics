Did you feel the breeze?
My love
Summer's kiss is over, baby
Over
Do you know the words?
Sing along with me
And put on your rose fur coat, baby
It's 1973

My love, this dream I have each night
I stare into a blinding light
Alone, I stare

Demons, be gone
Away from me
And come on down to the corner
I got something i want you to see
The burning sun
Too hot for shade
Come lay down in the cool grass
With me, baby let's watch that 
Summer fade

My love, this dream I have each night
I stare into a blinding light
Alone, I stare
So sweet
This dream is not a dream
I wake with it
Inside of me
Alone, I swear
