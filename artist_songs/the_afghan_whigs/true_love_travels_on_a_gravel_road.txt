How many girls 
Would choose a cotton-dress world
When they could have satins and lace? 
To stand by her man
Through good times and bad
And still keep a smile on her face?
How many hearts would feel the winter's wind blow
And still not turn cold?
True love travels on a gravel road
Love is a stranger and hearts are in danger
On smooth streets paved with gold
But true love travels on a gravel road
Down through the years
We've had hard times and tears
But it only helps our love grow
And we'll stay together
No matter how strong the wind blows
Not once have I seen your blue eyes fill with envy
And stray from the one that you hold 
True love travels on a gravel road 
Love is a stranger and hearts are in danger 
On smooth streets paved with gold 
But true love travels on a gravel road...
