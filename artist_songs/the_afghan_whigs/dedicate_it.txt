My love don't comfort me
She toys with my sincerity
On that I can depend

Yeah, I've found that nothing's straight
My twisted mind is bent all out of shape
But you will come back and you will live on
Indeed I know

But you wouldn't lie when I told you to
Had to waste your time and tell the truth, yeah
This one is three, this one is three, this one is three
Indeed I know
You got me figured out now
Now we're both disappointed

(Shall we go back, yeah lets go)

What's done is now undone
Let's cut the line and have the action
In time I will be able to give
I know

But you wouldn't lie when I told you to
Had to waste your time and tell the truth yeah
This one is three, this one is three, this one is three, yeah
Indeed I know
You got me figured out now
Now we're both disappointed yeah
You got me figured out now
Now we're both disappointed
