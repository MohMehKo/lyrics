My darling, I
Can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe

Oh, some things I can't get used to
No matter how I try
It's like the more you give, the more I want
And baby, that's no lie, oh, no, babe

Tell me, what can I say, what am I gonna do
How should I feel when everything is you
What kind of love is this that you're givin' me
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet

Girl, all I know
Is every time you're here
I feel the change
Somethin' moves
I scream your name
Look what you got me doin'

Darling, I
Can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe, oh, no, babe

Girl, if I can only make you see
And make you understand
Girl, your love for me is all I need
And more than I can stand, oh, well, babe

How can I explain all the things I feel
You've given me so much, girl, you're so unreal
Still I keep loving you more and more each time
Girl, what am I gonna do because you're blowin' my mind

I get the same old feelin'
Every time you're here
I feel the change
Somethin' moves
I scream your name
Look what you got me doin'

Darling, I
Can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe

How can I explain all the things I feel
You've given me so much, girl, you're so unreal
Still I keep loving you more and more each time
Girl, what am I gonna do because you're blowin' my mind

I get the same old feelin'
Every time you're here
I feel the change
Somethin' moves
I scream your name
Look what you got me doin'

Darling, I
Can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe

Darling, I
Can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe
