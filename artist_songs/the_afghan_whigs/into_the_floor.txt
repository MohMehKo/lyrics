When it burns and falls into the floor
Feel it rise and come and get some more
I'll remember you always this way

When it seems your back's against the wall
Tilt the sky and under you will crawl
I'll remember you

Is it late
Or is it yet to come?
Will it wait
Or burn into the sun
I'll remember you always this way

And suddenly
It was meant to be

When it burns and falls into the floor
Feel it rise and come and get some more
I'll remember you always this way

And suddenly
A summer breeze
