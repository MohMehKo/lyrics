Jean Content, he wake up everyday
In a government yard deep down inside Citi Soleil
Roll some bones and catch a fire, evil minds they will conspire
The moon to lose its light, the stars sink into night

Across the town a young girl plays guitar
"Do you remember me?"
She sings to a lover she worships from afar
Roll some bones and catch a fire, evil minds they will expire
The moon to shine a light upon us all tonight

Ooh child, I'll meet you child
On the sunny side
It's alright, it's alright
No lies, and no cryin'
It's alright, alright, alright

Ooh child, I'll meet you child
On the sunny side
It's alright, it's alright
No lies and no cryin'
It's alright, alright, alright

"How you like me now?"
My friend, he say
"How you like the madness of Citi Soleil?"

Roll the bones and catch a fire, join the triumph of the choir
Citi Soleil, Citi Soleil, I love to say Citi Soleil

Ooh child, I'll meet you child
On the sunny side
It's alright, it's alright
No lies and no cryin'
It's alright, alright, alright

Ooh child, I'll meet you child
On the sunny side
It's alright, it's alright
No lies and no cryin'
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright
It's alright, ooh

Ooh child, I'll meet you child
On the sunny side
It's alright, it's alright
No lies and no cryin'
It's alright, alright, alright

Ooh child, I'll meet you child
On the sunny side
It's alright, it's alright
No lies and no cryin'
It's alright, alright, alright

Ooh child, I'll meet you child
On the sunny side
It's alright, it's alright
No lies and no cryin'
It's alright, alright, alright
Ooh child, I'll meet you child
