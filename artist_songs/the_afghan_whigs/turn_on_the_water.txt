Untie the boat, turn on the water
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
It's alright
Untie the boat, turn on the water
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
It's alright

Carry me out, into the ocean
Save me a prayer and then lower the side
Untie the boat, turn on the water
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
But it's alright

And you can hold me down
But don't you let me breathe
Let it wash all over me
Let it wash all over me

They cut off my head, child, and gave it away
And poisoned the people, I wanted to save
And left me here dark an' rolling around
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
But it's alright

And you can hold me down
But don't you let me breathe
Let it wash all over me
Let it wash all over me

Untie the boat, turn on the water
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone and it's alright
Untie the boat, turn on the water
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
It's alright

Carry me out, into the ocean
Save me a prayer and then lower the side
Untie the boat, turn on the water
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
But it's alright

And you can hold me down
But don't you let me breathe
Don't you let me breathe
Don't you let me breathe
Let it wash all over me
Let it wash all over me
Don't you let me breathe
Don't you let me breathe
Don't you let me breathe
