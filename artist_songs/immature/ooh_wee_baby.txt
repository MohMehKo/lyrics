[Chorus]
Ooh Wee Baby
Ooh Wee
Come and play with me

Come on come on get it get it
If you down wit' it
Don't bite it come and get it
And be all down wit'it
'cause I drop my thizangs
With codes so you knizoes
Ain't no tellin' baby where
Me and you gizoes
Dippin' in my caddy, ain't it plush?
And the way that I fuss too much
You got my adrelanine pumpin'
Got me deep into somethin'
With my Immature behavin'
I ain't stoppin' for nuthin'
See ain't nothin' but a gansta party
When the girlies in the clubs startin'
Actin' naughty
Ooh wee check it out
I disappear like a bat in the air
It's like who, what, when, where?

It's you I need with me
Baby why can't you see
I am the man you want
Baby no need to front

See let's go to my room
So we can have some fun
I just wanna show you what's inside of me for you

[Chorus]

Baby you
Keep freakin' me the way you do
Be yourself and always stay true
Be you
Stay true

Ha ha....It's all about 5's 10's 20's
50's and 100's cash money
See ain't a damn thing funny
When it comes to honeys
It's all money don't act funny
See baby notice the way I shake, rattle and roll
Got you all in control got you all in my mode
See conversation runs all and without it can't fall
Small thangz run large and with that I'm in charge
Catch you chillin'with the feelin'every time of the flow
LDB...Batman....and Romeo
Got you chillin' in the club
Showin' everybody love
Got the whole crowd sayin'
Whatcha' thinkin' of?

[Chorus]
