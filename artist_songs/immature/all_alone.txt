This song is dedicated to my mother
Who I really loved a lot
And who I lost
she'll always be in my heart
4ever... I love u

[Chorus:]
I'm all alone
Alone
In this whole world
With no one by my side
But you
New you're gone
Now you're gone

[Repeated]

[1st Verse:]
Everyday, I hope and pray
You'll come back in my life
You were my friend
My confidant
I treasure every moment with you
Oh what am I supposed to do
My mother and my friend
Until the end , i never will forget

[Chorus: Repeated 2 times]

[2nd Verse:]
The smile you gave
The way we played
You gave me all my strength
When I think about life
I know you'll always lead my path
Apart of you is still in me
Which means we're always together
Forever...
You'll always be
You'll always be
Apart of me

[Chorus: Repeated 2 times]

[Bridge:]
You gave me your love
I treasured your love 
I miss you
I gave you my love
Oh, oh, oh
I know that you love me
I know you will protect me
I love you so much
I don't want to be alone

[Chorus: Repeated 5 times]
