Yeah, this is Romeo
And Immature's 'bout to drop that new jack funk on ya'
You livin' large, duece
This psychological trio
Always on our worst behavior
Yo' what up Hal-Pint
Yo' Batman, kick it

[Batman:]
People look out
We're comin' at you
Immature's gonna turn it out (Turn it out)
Doin' what we won't do
Takin' no shorts
And breakin' all the rules

Don't be frontin' on us
'Cause we ain't havin' it
We're just havin' fun
Distrupting all of
'Cause a kid that rocks the cradle
Is a kid to rules the world

[Chorus:]
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up

[Romeo:] Yo' Batman drop the second verse

[Batman:]
People always peepin' our sound
'Cause we're nine years old
And wiser than our years
We always do, what people don't expect
But after Marq, we don't regret

Don't be frontin' on us
'Cause we ain't havin' it
We're just havin' fun
Distrupting all of
'Cause a kid that rocks the cradle
Is a kid to rules the world

Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up [8x]

[Romeo (Talking):]
This is Romeo
And we still rockin' that funky Immature stuff
In the house we got Jermaine for Kris Kross posse
To show you how deep we rollin'
Jermaine, break 'em off some

[Jermaine Dupri:]
Rip it up, tear it up
No one doesn't matter what is
'Cause these kids, a little bad but
Here they come like a bomb, hope you lay low
'Cause the tre, from L.A. ain't no joke
Marq, the Don, don't forget Jerome
Three bad brothers got it goin' on, huh
Here's the flavor, nothin' can save ya
When they on their worst behavior

Can't nobody, can't nobody play this, Immature
Can't nobody, can't nobody, can't nobody, play this

[Chorus]

Can't nobody, can't nobody play this, Immature (Yeah)
Can't nobody, can't nobody, can't nobody, play this
Can't nobody, can't nobody play this, Immature
Can't nobody, can't nobody, can't nobody, play this

Waitin' to holler, drop the sounds
