[Chorus]
Sweetest Love, Sweetest desire
Sweetest love, one and only desire

I fell in love from the moment we met
You looked into my eyes I knew
There wasn't one thing I wouldn't do
Just to be with you

[Chorus]

Hold me and say I'm the one that you love
And there's no one else but me girl
And we'll take this time to promise each other
We'll be together forever

[Chorus]
