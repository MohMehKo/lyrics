[Chorus]
Your love's sweeter than candy
So keep swingin it my way
That's the only love that I will ever need

Look at me, acting like a child
I can't keep this smile off my face
Its been a while, since I've felt your warm embrace
Tonite our love awaits
You've got that something
When you pour it on like rain
Sweeter than a candy cane
Just keep it comin
'cause you know I like the way
Girl you make me say

[Chorus]

Carefully I put your hand in mine

As you take me to that special place
With your style you know you drive me wild
In your arms I wanna stay forever and today
You've got that something
When you pour it on like rain
Its sweeter than a candy cane
Just keep it comin
You know I like the way
You know it makes me say

[Chorus]

Taste and see
How good our love could be
Taking me on a ride to estacy
Totally, me for you and you for me
I've got to have my candy

[Chorus]
