[Da Boy Wonder:]
Eh yo, band, cut me up, yo
Immature, Darkchild
All day everyday
You can see me in the drop top S L K
D to the A to the R to the K
Child it's been a while
And I still can't wait

[Mr. Mike Nitty:]
Well ex'causee me
Can I have your attention
There's just a few things
That I've got to mention
I know you don't know me
But my name is Mikey
And after this shhh
You're sure to like me

[Chorus]
I can't wait (Oh baby I can't wait)
To see you today (See you today)
I got you on my mind (Baby I can't wait)
To see your face (To see you today)
[Repeat]

[Batman:]
Tell me what time are we hookin' up
'cause I can't wait (Until we get in touch)
Girl you got me open like an all night store
So come on girl
I'll give you what you're lookin' for

[Chorus]

[Batman:]
You should know just how I feel
When you come around, I feel so good inside
That's why I need you girl right now
I can't wait, baby

[Chorus]

[Batman:]
Won't 'yall break it down
Break it down

[Da Boy Wonder:]
Mr. Mike Nitty get down right now

[Mr. Mike Nitty:]
Now now now now
Who make you boogie like me, nobody
(You jigglin' baby)
Drive them young girls crazy 
Yo, how it go let me know the deal
Shorty slam outta my gas
So tell me how it feel

[Da Boy Wonder:]
I'm the big boy 
That makes the big hits
Stack the big chips
Float the big whips
Baby, dig this
Got ice on my wrist
We eat on platium plates, around eight
I just can't wait

[Chorus]
