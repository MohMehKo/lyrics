[Chorus]
I'm given you all my time
Just come and feel the flavor
Whether its rain or shine
Cuz we got it

Thinkin of you is all I do
Daydreamin' about my boo
Crazy days I like your silly ways
And just thinkin bout you
What can I do

[Chorus]

I know our love is real
You make my mind do flips
Its funny how you make me feel
Toss and turnin in my bed
My time is just for you 24/7 our love is true

[Chorus]

Its the mack of the year in your ear
With the flavor you've been waitin for
A taste in your face don't take it personal
4 deep we gonna creep for the street
Smooth Batman and Romeo and LDB
Throw your hands in the air put the bounce in your body
Microphone check now scream ladi dadi
Ain't no party like an Immature party
Give 'em props, cuz you love what they got

[Chorus]

Don't you wanna feel the funk
What we got is what you want
Don't you wanna feel the funk
What we got is what you want
