You know what girl
I'm really hurting inside
I just don't understand how you could hurt me
And break my heart 
That's why I wanna sing this song
To let you know how I really feel
'Cause you broke my heart

[Chorus]
What would you do
What would you do
What would you do if you had a broken heart
Sweethang sweethang

All I do is think of you
I'm so sorry for what I've done
I want you back in my life
I'm glad you still love me
Girl you know you broke my heart
Oh yeah

[Chorus]

There's no other girl
Who can make me feel this way
You're so special
There's no one like you
I know that we'll get back together
If you don't break my heart

[Chorus]

You know what girl
We've really been through a lot
You know and I know
That we gotta get back together
I just don't understand
I'm just thinkin' right now baby
Uh uh uh

[Chorus]
