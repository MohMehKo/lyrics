Hey there lady
Your on my mind (on my mind)
I think about you everyday
I think about you all the time (all the time)
Wonderin' if (wonderin' if)
Somebody else is lovin' you (whose lovin' u)
'Cause nobody in this world
Makes me feel like you do

[Chorus]
I can't stop the rain
Get down with the Immature flavor
I can't stop the rain
Get down with the Immature flavor
I can't stop the rain
Get down with the Immature flavor
Take the pain
Just like the rain falls from the sky
That's how my heart feels inside
Since you've been gone

I admit (I admit)
I acted just like a fool (like a fool)
Playin' on your emotions (emotions...)
Girl, I shoulda been good to you (should of been good to you)
Your love for me
Was ever so true 
Ooh...baby (baby)
And that's why
I'm gonna make it up to you

[Chorus]

Romeo Romeo
Romeo Romeo
Romeo Romeo
Romeo Romeo here I go

[Chorus]
