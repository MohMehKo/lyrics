Yeah this for all those ladies out there
that's waitin' for that hustler that pimp
that playa to hit you on the side

[Chorus]
I'll make sure I'll hit you on the side a little later
(I'll make sure I hit you)
So you know its just me jockin' you on your pager
(I'll make sure I hit you)

When your out about with your girlfriends
You know I'm callin' baby 
So don't pretend baby
I try to reach your heart 
Through your private line..oh baby
I cant help the fact
That your always on my mind baby

[Chorus]

Baby answer me when you feel me call

If I cant have you girl 
I don't want anyone at all, baby
True feelings that I try to hide baby
Keep showin' girl 
When I hit you on the side of your pager

Romeo Romeo feel me flow
When you feel the rat-tat in your pocket
Don't stop it
Just lock it
Yeah uh yeah yeah

[Chorus]

So uh..here I go one more
I come again with this pager flow
Rock on rock on yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
