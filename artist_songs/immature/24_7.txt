I cant sleep, cuz you're not here 
This isn't just another love affair 
And I don't need, nobody else 
It's killing me, day by day 
Feelin stronger every minute only you 
Can get me up this way, whoa 

[Chorus]
65 weeks and it's been too long 
Tryin to keep it down until you puttin' me on 
All theses other girls, they just won't do 
24/7 I've been thinking of only you 
Only you 

Ooh, girl tonight, I'm prepared 
To find a way to get you over here 
I really need, some love and care 
So come to me, don't make me wait 
It all comes down to what you want 
Not only words you say, yeah oh 

[Chorus]

Only you (Only you) 
Only you 

Everybody say 
Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh babe 
Everybody say 
Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh baby 
Everybody say 
Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh babe 
Everybody say 
Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh baby 
Ooh baby, baby 

[Chorus]

Only you (Only you) 
Only you (Only you) 

[Chorus]

Only you (Only you) 
Only you (Only you) 
Baby (Baby) 
Baby (Baby) 
Come on, baby 

[Chorus]

Only you (Only you) 
Only you (Only you) 
Whoa (Whoa) 
Only you (Only you) 
Yeah, baby 

Now see it's all about you babe 
It's all about you babe 
It's all about you babe 
It's all about you babe 

Everybody say (Everybody say) 
Everybody say (Everybody say)
