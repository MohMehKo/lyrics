[Chorus]
Where (Where) Where (Where)
Where do we go from where (here)
I can prove my love
Where do we go from here 
Let me open up to you
Let's swallow all the negativity of life
We can make it through 
Only if we try

I feel your tears fall from your face into my hand
I feel the hurt inside your heart
Near mine 
Where did (we go wrong?)
It's no way to figure out
I know I can't live without you

[Chorus]

I miss you whispering softly in my ear
I miss your tender kiss
Against my lips
Where did (we go wrong?)
(I can't figure it out)
But I (But I)
I know (I know)
That I love you....Oh

(Baby please don't go) ooh
(I will never lie) I will never lie
(Lie again) lie again
(Constantly I think) Constantly (of you) I think of you
(Oh yes) oh yes (I do) I do
(Please stay) Please stay
(With me) With me
(Please stay) Ooh now (with me)
Ooh baby yeah yeah

[Chorus]
