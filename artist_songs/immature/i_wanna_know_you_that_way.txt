Immature, kick that for all the ladies out there

[Batman:]
There's a way, we both feel, as one
Here inside my heart, until we understand
That love takes forever, hold me now
I'll make you secure so let's make it tonight, yeah

[Chorus:]
I wanna know u that way, that way
I wanna know u that way, that way
I wanna know u that way, that way
I wanna know u that way

In your eyes, someone tells to me
This could never be, and still I can't ignore
This feeling of me
I'll make you secure so let's make it tonight, yeah

[Chorus]

Wanna know you in that way [2x]

Wanna know you in that way (That way)

[Chorus (Repeat til fades)]
