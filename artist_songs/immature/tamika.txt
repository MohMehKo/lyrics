Tamika...
Ohh....
I don't wanna wait til tomorrow....
Cause everyday I'm away from u I feel so bad...
Oh cause I need someone
(Need someone)
In my life
(In my life)
Lately I don't know if it's wrong or right...
(Wrong or right)
All I know...
Is I just don't wanna wait 'til tomorrow

[Chorus:]
You mean the world...
to me Tamika...
You are my everything...
Tamika
[repeat]

I shouldn't have to wait 'til tomorrow...
I wouldn't hesitate for a yes... or no...
Why don't you tell me if I could be a part of you...
(In your life, in your life)
Cause I want so much to be...oh, over you

[Chorus (2x)]

[Chorus (repeat 3x until it fades)]
