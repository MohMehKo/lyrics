[Chorus]
It's nothin' but a party
It's nothin' but a party
It's nothin' but a party
It's nothin' but a party

Let me know
If you wanna jam
All I want you to know
Is I want to be your man
I'll meet ya on the floor
That's what I wanna do
So we can dance and party 

And I'll freak my move on you

[Chorus]

Get on up
Start to dance
No more time for playing
You know what I'm saying
I wanna move ya to the floor
I wanna dance some more
With you baby

[Chorus]
