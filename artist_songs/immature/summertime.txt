[Chorus]
Summertime, a fun time
(It's fun in the hood)

Riding down the shore
In their jeeps
Bumpin' to the Immature dope beat
Real fly cuties
With their sistas'
Hanging in the mall
Can I give you a call
Cause its summertime

[Chorus]

Lets go shoppin'
For some Nikes
Hang out at the arcade all night
No more school
Means no more rules
Lets go swimming in my pool
Cause its summertime

[Chorus]

On the shore with the jeep beat
On the shore with the jeep beat
The jeep beat

[Chorus]
