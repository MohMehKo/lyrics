(Good things) Come to those that wait [4x]

[Batman:]
Someday I'll see the fruit of babies
I'll have a piece of the pie
I'm always doin' everyone a favor

When will the part be mine

Try and try
Harder work the words of my mama
From the day that I begin
She said, keep up faith and don't let nothing get your way
And baby you'll get close in the end

[Chorus:]
(Good things) Come to those that wait
(Good things) Come to those that wait
And if you think that it's impossible
I got something you should know
(Good things) Come to those that wait
That's what somebody told me

[Batman:]
I know, it's just a matter of time
I'll wait for my big day
I asked the one above and he told me
It comes to those who wait

Try and try
Harder work the words of my mama
From the day that I begin
She said, keep up faith and don't let no one in your way
And baby you'll get close in the end

[Chorus (2x)]

[Chorus (2x)]

(Good things) Come to those that wait [4x]

That's what somebody told me
