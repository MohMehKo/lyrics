Intro..
Yo its Romeo
Yeah and Immatures back on
And we doin' it like this
Uh yeah..
A yo Batman be right here

[Chorus]
Let me walk you home from school
And do the little things I wanna do
Let me walk you home from school
And do the little things I wanna do

Baby would you be mine
Ive never seen no one
Let loose like you
Hold my hand
Come walk with me
Baby Baby Baby you can see
I am the key

[Chorus]

Because its time to be
More then just friends
Just you and me
I wanna be your man
Come stroll with me
I wanna walk you home
'Cause there's lots of things to see

[Chorus]

Romeo Romeo here I go
I wanna walk you home so you know so you know
There's things to be done hun
For fun hun
Yo momz, I'm not your son honey-bun
I wanna walk up your stairs real sneaky
Romeo's gonna get real freaky
Romeo Romeo I hear you screaming my name

[Chorus]
