[Romeo:] Oh yeah

[Chorus:]
Be my honey dip
Be my honey dip
Be my honey dip
Be mine
Be my honey dip
Be my honey dip
Be my honey dip
Be mine

[Romeo (Talking over Chorus):]
Another funk-one from Immature
This goes out to all y'all honey dips out there
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Kick it Marq

[Batman:]
Will you spend, sometime with me
You are the girl of my fantasy (Fantasy)
Will you do what I ask you
All I wanna do is, be with you

[Chorus]

[Batman:]
Will you hottie be with me (Be with me)
Can I dip into you honey (Honey)
Your body's where, I wanted to be
You were gonna be my, honey dip

Ooh, with your sexy body
The way you hold me
You're to send tingles down my back
Will you be mine

[Chorus (2x)]

[Batman:] Yo Romeo, kick it

Honey dip, honey dip, seen a honey dip, dip [2x as background]

[Romeo:] Move over down the block
Shorty's on my dock
Saw a honey dip
Now surely had to get
[Batman:] Ooh, take a trip with me
Skip candy love, honey dip with me
[Romeo:] I got you just built like Monopoly
[Batman:] Collect call you want
And just be with me
[Romeo:] Oh yeah
[Batman:] Boo-yah, the onion's kinda phat

[Batman:]
Ooh, with your sexy body
The way you hold me
You send chills down my back
Will you be mine

[Chorus (Repeat 'til music fades)]
