[Verse 1]
Hey girl, when I looked at you
I'd never seen brown eyes so true
Oh, something wonderful came over me
You got to hear my cry for sympathy

[Chorus 1]
You drive me crazy
Don't know what to do
You got me baby
I'm so hooked on you
You drive me crazy
With the things you do
You got me baby

[Verse 2]
Baby, you're always on my mind
I swear I think that you're so fine
Girl in time, love the way, the way you make me feel
I know this time the feeling's real

[Chorus 2]
You drive me crazy
Don't know what to do

You got me baby
I'm so into you
You drive me crazy
With the things you do
You got me baby

[Verse 3]
You must know you mean the world to me
There is no other love I can see
Not a day comes by without me, knowin' that I
Want you, want you by my side for the rest of my life

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 4]
Everyday I think of you
'Cause I really like the way you make me feel
It's not what you do, it's the way you do it (Girl, it's the way!)
You know how to make my dreams come true

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2/Fade Out]
