[Romeo:] Yo, y'all like that
[Half-Pint:] Dang, baby's fine
[Batman:] And I can think of a hundred ways
[Half-Pint:] 'Cause we on our worst behavior
[Romeo:] Ya got that right (Whoo)
[Half-Pint:] Dang, baby got the works
[Romeo:] I'm 'bout to rush that
[Half-Pint:] Baby psychological
[Batman:] Man let me hmm hmm hmm
[Romeo:] I wish I could tell my song
[Batman:] Yo Immature, kick it to her

Ooooh [7x as background]

[Batman:] Can you meet me outside, girl

[Batman:]
I see you there across the room
That brings joy into my heart
To say, we're together, yeah
All the ugly little faces around
Really don't stand a chance
With your lovely ways in the air
They don't compare

I know we bustin' inside
But I'd do anything, to keep you by my side
You mean everything to me, yeah
It's hard to pull you away
But I must tell you right now
About the joy
And love you bring, hey yeah

Can you meet me outside
Can you meet me outside
Meet me outside ooh oh oh, oooh (So I could tell you how I feel)

[Chorus:]
Can you meet me outside
Can you meet me outside
Meet me outside ooh oh oh, oooh
Can you meet me ouside

[Batman:]
All the things you do
Strike me as a cute little habit
That you really shouldn't lose
'Cause you drive me crazy girl yeah
Now some things you do
Really rub in the wrong wrong way
I get excused
But I still love you with all my heart

Can you meet me outside
Can you meet me outside
Meet me outside ooh oh oh, oooh (So I could tell you how I feel)
Can you meet me outside

[Chorus (3x)]

[Batman:] Let's go talk to her
Hey y'all, let's go wait for her over the fire escape
[Romeo:] She's definitely worth waiting for
[Half-Pint:] I just sing the whole song to her and see girlie waitin' a
All those for us
[Batman:] Hey look, she got some homies, one for you, you and you.
Hey where'd they go

I wanna say

Na na na, na-na na-na [3x as background]
Na, na, na, na, na

[Romeo:] Oh man
[Half-Pint:] They left, man, let's go
[Batman:] Let's go man, let's go
[Half-Pint:] Peace man

[Chorus (Repeat til music fades)]

Na na na, na na na [Sing over Chorus]
Na na na, na-na na-na [Sing over Chorus]
