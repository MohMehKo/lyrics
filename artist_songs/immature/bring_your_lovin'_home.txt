[Romeo:]
Yeah, yeah
Look here boo
I'm attracted to you
How many ways
Can I interact with you
My brown sugar baby, you taste so sweet
Finger lickin' good
From your head to your feet
You're thinkin' everybody got a piece of me
Yeah baby
I'm bad as Michael J, see
Billy Jean is not my lover
Go and see the ebony lover

[Batman:]
Watchin', moving slowly in the dark
Chocolate dreams those feelings bout' to start
In my mind everytime it's me and you
One more dance
Baby, love me now and through

[Chorus:]
Bring your lovin' home my baby
Bring it home to me
I just wanna know if we can still swing
Round and round with you my baby
Up and down we through
Bring your lovin' home my baby
Whoo hoo

[Batman:]
Still in, feelin more in love with you
When you dance I feel my hands on you
Come with me, I'll show love that's true
Baby, oh, what can I do for you

Still in love
Moments shared
Round and round
Dancin', dancin' in your heart tonight

[Chorus:]
Bring your lovin' home my baby
Bring it home to me
I just wanna know if we can still swing
Round and round with you my baby
Up and down we through
Bring your lovin' home my baby
Whoo hoo

[Romeo:]
I got what you want, don't sleep
Cartier links (what) Persian minks, what
No pressure lil' mama
I keep you in Gabbana
I keep you in the Donna
You wearin Karen
Got people starin at you
Because of things that I do, boo
Haha, haha, haha
Now bring it home to the Rome

[Chorus x2:]
Bring your lovin' home my baby
Bring it home to me
I just wanna know if we can still swing
Round and round with you my baby
Up and down we through
Bring your lovin' home my baby
Whoo hoo

Bring your lovin' home my baby
Round and round with you my baby
