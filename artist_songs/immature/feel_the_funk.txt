2 think about memories of you and I

it's alright 4 you 2 be next 2 me
so I can hold you tight

or 2 your house

let your body go 
put you in the mood 
let it sue

and I think I am going 2 rhyme
Nothing else 2 do I'm just a crazyfeel or not
But 2 feel the funk'?

put you in the mood 
let it sue love will make you...
feel the funk now
