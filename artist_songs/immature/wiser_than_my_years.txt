[Half-Pint:] Did you hear about the riot?
[Batman:] Yup (Dang) man that was crazy
[Romeo:] I just don't understand
[Half-Pint:] I guess we're too young to understand
[Romeo:] I don't understand why people can't just live together

Oooh

[Batman:]
Why is it, no one know, I seem to know so much
The people say, I must've been here before
But if it's true, then why can't I, remember who I was
Where I lived, or who I loved anymore

Somehow at my age I learned a lot
Without going to the school or fall in love
But what it all comes down to, is for epace to come to me
Loving as to love itself, that's the key, and that makes me

[Chorus:]
Wiser than my years
But na√Øve enough not to know
For many of doubts and fears
So I need somebody ideas

Cuz I'm wiser than my, years, oh yeah
Wiser than my years

[Batman:]
And still it seems, the price I've paid, is often I could pull
Cuz no one tries, to challenge my state of mind
So every night, before I sleep, I pray a simple prayer
Give me this chance, and give joy, all the time

Now somewhere down the line where I go on
And make it to another world beyond
Through the other puzzle, you will see what I understand
For us to walk in free, that's the key, and that makes me

[Chorus (2x)]

Cuz I'm wiser than my, years, oh yeah
Wiser than my years (Yes I am, yes I am)
Wiser than my years (I can feel it deep down)
Wiser than my years (Yes I can, yeah)
Wiser than my years (That I'm wiser than, my years)
Wiser than my years (I feel like I've been here before)
Wiser than my years (Oh, baby)
Wiser than my years (Gonna say a simple prayer)
Wiser than my years (To give me strength)
Wiser than my years (What am I, gonna do, cuz I'm so much younger)
Wiser than my years (I feel like I've been here before, oh)
Wiser than my years
Wiser than my years (Yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
Wiser than my years
Wiser than my years

[Batman:] Why can't grown-ups learn what kids already know
