[Bizzy Bone Rap 1]

[Verse 1]
As I walk across the road (across the Road)
I just think about my life...how I grow old (how I grow old)
And I think about the things the people do and how kids that 
they can't go to public schools and I see how this world has 
been ruined (has been Ruined) But what can we do, what can we do?
(what can we do) But what can we do, what can we do?
(What can we do) Peace at the end of the 
end of the world is where we are

[Chorus repeat 8x]
From coast to coast give up the ghost ghost

[Bizzy Bone Rap 2]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Everybody that's confused just see me out
(just see me out) From coast to coast,from coast to coast, give
up the ghost All our homies really don't know just what to do 
(just what to do) 'cause there's a coffin over there waitin'  for you 
downloadin' all the info from your mind (downloadin all the info) where your 
soul has gone we will find Peace at the end of the world is where we are

[Repeat Chorus]
