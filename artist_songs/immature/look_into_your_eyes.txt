Sensitive but sweet
The kinda girl a boy would wanna meet
Very clever so unique
Baby knocks me off my feet
On and on all I do is dream about you
Hold me gentle hold me tight
I think about you every night

[Chorus]
Let me look into your eyes
They say that eyes don't lie
Now I know that you are mine
Cause I'm looking into your eyes

Your eyes gave me the sign

Told me that you want me
Told me that you need me
I want you to see this love can go far
I know that you wanna get with me girl
Hold me, tight

I see you, and I know that you want me
Your eyes say ooo love me
Be my baby today is our day (today's our day, hey)
I see you I know that you want me
Your eyes say oo love me (oo love me)
My baby today is our day (today's our day, hey)

[Chorus]
