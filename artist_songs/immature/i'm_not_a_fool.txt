I'm reminiscing on all the times we shared
I can't seemed to forget, the times that we've spent
And I miss your pretty smile just seems to brighten up my day
I want you here with me, I'm callin' out your name

Hear me, my pretty girl, you're on my mind
I wanna hold you in my my my my my arms
Tonight, let's make it right, unless we're face to face
You can't relate to what I have to say

I'm not a fool, please don't break my heart
I'm day dreamin' about you and I need you in my life
I'm not a fool, please don't break my heart
Please don't break my, don't break my heart

I'm sitting in my window watching cars go by
And hoping that one, you will be inside at night
I want you here with me no explanation goes
You move the way as if you feel, that's for sure

No no my baby girl
I wanna hold you in my arms
Tonight, let's make it right, unless we're face to face
You can't relate to what I have to say

I'm not a fool, please don't break my heart
I'm day dreamin' about you and I want you in my life
I'm not a fool, please don't break my heart
Don't break my heart, don't break my heart
I want you in my life, baby

Girl, I want to hold you in my arms
Tonight, let's make it right, unless we're face to face
You can't relate to what I have to say

I'm not a fool, please don't break my heart
I'm not a fool, please don't break my heart
I'm not a fool, please don't break my heart
I'm not a fool, please don't break my heart
