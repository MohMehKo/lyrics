[Chorus]
I wanna pay you back
For the things you do for me
I love you so
Never let you go

You give me all your lovin'
And I wanna give you mine
'cause someone needs to pay you back for
For being so fine
I'll lay you on my magic carpet
And take you on a lover's ride
'cause I never met a girl who loved me
Let me lay it on the line

[Chorus]

If I ruled the world I'd give you

Everything your heart desired
Rubies as red as your lips
And diamonds shinin bright as your eyes
I'd build a castle on a mountain
Way up in the sky
A million dollar bill for every moment
'cause girl you are so fly

[Chorus]

Wassup up this Romeo
And I just wanna let you know
That I love you
And I like to pay you back for lovin' me

[Chorus]
