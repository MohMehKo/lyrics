[Chorus]
I don't know if you don't know
Where our love should go
Lovin you's impossible
Girl I don't know
Where our love should go
Lovin you's impossible

You call me late at night
Tryin to start a fight
Girl you know you've changed
I won't play these games
I sit and reminisce
Of us just kickin it

Now you wanna trip, I'm not havin it

[Chorus]

I don't wanna front
You used to treat me right
I don't understand
What happened to our plan
No man's supposed to cry
But girl I can't deny what I feel inside
These feelings I can't hide

[Chorus]
