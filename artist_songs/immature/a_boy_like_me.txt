[Chorus]
See a boy like me
Wants to get a girl like you
I wanna get you in the mood
In the mood

When I first laid eyes on you
You put me in a trance
I never met no one so fly
I can't believe my eyes
My sweet baby, sweet baby
Come over here
And let me be your man sweet thing

And I will treat you right

[Chorus]

I realize that we just met
Not tryin to go to fast
Not tryin to go to slow
Now see you got the vibe I like
Wanna make you my woman tonite
What am I supposed to do baby
'cause I wanna get with you sweet thing

[Chorus]
