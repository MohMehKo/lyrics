Under city lights
You got mesmerized
You forgot where you are from
And who you are

Such a tragedy
You were young and free
Did you ever think
That you'd fall so far

Turn it on tonight
Carolina
Till the morning light
Carolina

I remember when
You were innocent
I remember what you were
My dirty rose

Never happy now
You're just selling out
Easy street is drenched in tears
You know it's never paved in gold

Turn it on tonight
Carolina
Till the morning light
Carolina

Just leave your dirty little secrets for a while
Just leave your dirty little secrets for a while
Let me make it alright

[Solo]

Turn it on tonight
Carolina
Till the morning light
Carolina

Turn it on tonight
Carolina
Till the morning light
Carolina
