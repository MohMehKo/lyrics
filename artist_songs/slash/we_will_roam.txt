A restless tide
Is breaking on the shore
Unsettled skies
Beyond the storm

The wind we ride
Until we can no more
Just to find our own
Just to find out own

We can't let go

And still we roam
Now forevermore
Tread the night on steel and stone
And still we roam
Never asking more
Where we are will be our home
Our home

And it's been said
That we're the last to fall
A precious few
The first to fade

Keepers till the end
Of what was lost
Still we can't let go
Still we can't let go

We're on our own

And still we roam
Now forevermore
Tread the night on steel and stone
And still we roam
Never asking more
Where we are will be our home

And still we roam
Now forevermore
Tread the night on steel and stone
And still we roam
Never asking more
Where we are will be our home
