It was a blood red summer
One I can’t forget
When you took the one thing
All in this world I had left

For I will remember
Until the end of time
If it takes forever
Retribution will be mine

This I know
In the end
But I wanted you to know
That I wont forget, no

In the fields you'll hear us crying
For the ones we've lost and loved
Underneath the savage sun

How many killing seasons
Can you justify?
How many dead and bleeding
Only for an ivory lie?

Was it for the money?
Was it for the thrill?
If I could have my way
Yours would be the blood I’d spill

But I won't
Not today
'Cause revenge is best served cold
This I know
So I wait

In the fields you'll hear us crying
For the ones we've lost and loved

'Cause the evil never stops and we keep dying
Underneath a savage sun
Underneath a savage sun

How many bleeding and how many die?
All for the greed of an ivory lie 
When will they see what they’ve done isn't right?
The blood that they spill could not be justified

How many bleeding and how many die?
Blood that they spill could not be justified 

In the fields you'll hear us crying
For the ones we've lost and loved

'Cause the evil never stops and we keep dying
Underneath a savage sun
Underneath a savage sun
