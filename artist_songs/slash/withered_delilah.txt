You had to climb for what you are
You had to break out every trick you could pull
But there comes a time when everything must turn off
Back to the start again
Back to the place where you've come from

Stuck out of view
My withered Delilah
You know it's true 
That no one cares anymore 

Stuck out of view
You had your time and now your moment is all but gone

Lost in a daze what have you done?
Digging a grave to be your own
You're soon to fade but just too blind to let go
Of what you had and what you were
Irrelevance hurts, but you're not alone

Stuck out of view
My withered Delilah
You know it's true
That no one cares anymore

Stuck out of view
You had your time and now your moment is all but gone

So pack your diamond rings
All your pretty things
And just move along

'Cause there's always somebody else 
To replace you when you are gone

(When you are gone, Hey yeah)

Stuck out of view
My withered Delilah
You know it's true
That no one cares anymore

Stuck out of view
You had your time and now your moment is all but gone

Stuck out of view
My withered Delilah
You know it's true
That no one cares anymore

Stuck out of view
You had your time and now your moment is all but gone
Your moment is all but gone                    
Oh it's gone
