Hold my hands down 
So they don't 

In case you don't know 
A saint is a sinner too 

Blind my eyes so they 
So I can't see 

What coming for you 
Is coming for me 

I hear the choir sing 
Calling me on back to you 

And I forget now just what I'm supposed to do 
When a saint is a sinner too 

I hear the choir sing 
Calling me on back to you 

And I forget now just what I'm supposed to do 
When a saint is a sinner too 
A saint is a sinner too 

Hold hold my hands down 
Hold my hands down 

I don't reach 
I don't reach 
So I don't reach for you 

Oh oh 
A saint is a sinner too
