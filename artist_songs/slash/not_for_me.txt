Dirty Sunrise creeping in,
Broken bottles, gilled within,
The room is black,
The blinds are drawn,

I don't remember anything,
What I've done, where I've been,
Another night has come and gone,

This is not for me, no,
This is not for me, no,
This life is not for me, no,
This is not for me, no,
Anymore,

The devil smiles and laughs at me,
Says you'll be back, just wait and see,
You know I've heard this all before,

And I say,
You can keep your high life in the hills,
Your cocaine lies and whiskey thrills,
I don't need you anymore,

This is not for me, no,
This is not for me, no,
This life is not for me, no,
This is not for me, no,
Oh oh oh,

The only thing that makes me whole again,
Is to stand right here before you in the sun, oh,
I'll keep running til the very end,
For the life I've lived is not the life I want.

Dirty sunrise creeping in,
Broken bottles, gilled within,
In a place I don't belong,

This is not for me, oh,
This is not for me, oh,
This life is not for me, oh,
This life is not for me, oh,
Anymore, yeah,

You can keep your life,
I don't want anymore, yeah,
I'm gonna leave it all behind yeah,
I'm gonna leave it all behind yeah,
I don't want no more, don't want no more
Yeah yeah yeah.
