My Baby's fixin' her face, 
Doing her hair, 
Runnin' red lights in her underwear. 
She likes to step on the gas, 
Put her foot to the floor, 
Music to her ears when the engines roar. 

There ain't much she can't do; 
Anyhing I wanna do 
But when I turn my back 
I'm a mean speed demon heart attack 

Baby Can't Drive, 
Baby Can't Drive 
I'm a million miles away 
Doin' a hundred and five 
If you wanna survive, 
Try and get there alive 
Baby Can't Drive, 
Baby Can't Drive 

I got my red lips on, 
Makin' the stereo bleed. 
Texting my girls 
While I'm driving with my knee 
I'm doing my nails, 
I'm paintin' them black 
Cause baby's hit the road 
And there's no goin' back 

My knuckles turning white 
Cause baby wants to drive all night 
My Hair is turning grey 
Cause baby wants to drive all day 

Baby Can't Drive, 
Baby Can't Drive 
I'm a million miles away 
Doing a hundred and five 
If you wanna survive, 
Try and get there alive 
Baby Can't Drive, 
Baby Can't Drive 

Yeah, yeah 
Baby can't drive, 
Baby can't drive 
Yeah, yeah yeah 

Baby Can't Drive, 
Baby Can't Drive 
I'm a million miles away 
Doin' a hundred and five 
If you wanna survive, 
Try and get there alive 
Baby Can't Drive, 
Baby Can't Drive 

Baby, Baby, 
Baby, Baby can't drive 
You know I love you baby, 
But baby can't drive 
You just can't drive 
I never said I could 
Uh-uh, not my car....
