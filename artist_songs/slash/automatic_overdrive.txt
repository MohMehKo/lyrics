My baby's high
She's in overdrive
She's a fiend out on the floor
She's a shot of pain
She's a drop dead paramour

She comes around 
And she turns it out
Her disease I can't ignore
Puts it to the red like I've never seen before

But it's all right
Baby's automatic, she's in overdrive

Rollin' all night
Never slowing down till she sees the light

She always says she's sick and tired
Of the pressure and the pain
Bearing down on her like a ten ton suicide

How many times I tell her
If she keeps running at this pace
She'll be long burned out
Before she can ever reach the line

But it's all right
Baby's automatic, she's in overdrive

Rollin' all night
Never slowing down till she sees the light

She's running free
She's running hard
That's all she needs 
To reach the top

She's so obscene
She's all I've got
My motor queen 
Don't ever stop
Oh I want to do it again

'Cause it's all right
Baby's automatic, she's in overdrive

Rollin' all night
Never slowing down till she sees the light

'Cause it's all right
Baby's automatic, she's in overdrive

Rollin' all night
Never slowing down till she sees the light

But it's all right
Baby's automatic, she's in overdrive

Rollin' all night
Never slowing down till she sees the light

But it's all right
Baby's automatic, she's in overdrive

Rollin' all night
She ain't slowing down till she scores tonight
