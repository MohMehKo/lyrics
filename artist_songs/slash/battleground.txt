One more shot across the bow
One more bullet through the heart
You've got me bleeding on the ground
I've got you wounded in the dark

Why do we always 
Take this way too far?

Surrender tonight 
There's time save tomorrow
Mama, don't you let me down

This broken alliance
Leaves me so hollow
And wondering how
Did the bed that we made
Become our battleground?

Well the damage has been done
I know you hurt so don't pretend
Where we're used to making love
Now we're making war instead

Before it's too late
Lay your arms down let me in

Surrender tonight 
This time save tomorrow
Mama, don't you let me down 

This broken alliance
Leaves me so hollow
And wondering how
Did the bed that we made
Become our battleground?

Just hold your fire
Long enough to see
This ain't how it's supposed to be

Once all that we've got is lost
The walls will fall
Please don't let them fall on me

I wanna lay you down
Surrender all the sorrow 
The sorrow

Wanna lay you down
Surrender till it's gone

I wanna lay you down surrender
Till tomorrow 
Tomorrow

Wanna lay you down surrender till it's gone

(Lalalas)
Just surrender till it's gone 
Just surrender till it's gone
[Vocalizing]

(Lalalas)
I don't wanna fight no more
Say [vocalizing]
I can feel it all there
I wanna tell right just then and there oh
Say yeah
Say yeah

I don't wanna fight this battle anymore
