Stone blind
In the dark
Vision of beauty with an ugly heart 

Stone blind
To everything about her

She pulled the wool over my eyes
But the last nail in my coffin 
And robbed me blind 

It's the truth I can't deny
Only feeds off good intentions
As you beg for second sight

She's got me
Stone blind
In the dark
Vision of beauty with an ugly heart 

Stone blind
To everything about her

She always comes on way too strong
And the room fills up with fire 
And then she's gone 

My double talking debutante
In a hustle she will own ya
Till she gets all that she wants

She's got me
Stone blind
In the dark
Vision of beauty with an ugly heart

Stone blind
To everything about her

She's such a wicked thing
And though I've seen it all before
I'm in the dark again
The woman's got a way

She's got me
Stone blind
In the dark
Vision of beauty with an ugly heart

Stone blind
To everything about her

She's got me
Stone blind
In the dark
Vision of beauty with an ugly heart

Stone blind 
To everything about her

(Stone blind) She pulled the wool over my eyes
(Stone blind) She shot me down and robbed me blind
(Stone blind) And now I'm begging her for second sight
She's got me stone blind
