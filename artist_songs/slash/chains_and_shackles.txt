What makes you think I'm just a dog
They don't listen and don't pay
Put away your short leash I'll get the fuckin' chain
So step aside and I'll take control
I make right once you make wrong 
I let it go too long
I realize that all of these

Chains and shackles fill all
Like ribbons and bows
Like kill me in law

Fuck you can't make me stay here
Fuck this I won't bow to you
Fuck you can't make me stay here
Fuck this I won't bow to you

Bleeding cat on the floor
No fighting all the time
You can scream right in my face, 
I know your words mean nothing
You're just screeching out to fate
I only listen to the demon in my mind, 
He's always there
He's always staying with you behind

Chains and shackles fill all
Like a light summer dress
Like a river running wild 

Fuck you can't make me stay here
Fuck this I won't bow to you
Fuck you can't make me stay here
Fuck this I won't bow to you

I'm gonna keep you away, 'cause now I'm building,
Keep you away, 'cause now I'm building
Keep you away, 'cause now I'm building
And motherfucker...yeah, oh yeah

Yeah
Fuck you can't make me stay here
Fuck this I won't bow to you
Fuck you can't make me stay here
Fuck this I won't bow to you (leave your chains to me)
Fuck this I won't bow to you (leave your shackles too)

Fuck this I won't bow to you!
