Blood red sky on a desert road
Gotta make my way down to Mexico
For what I did I know that it was wrong
The fire in my heart, it will never die
Everything I love will be left behind
No turning back, forever gone tonight

All my love Anastasia, Anastasia
This may be our last goodbye
You can't save me, I am fading
Blood is on my hands tonight

All that I need is a miracle
Lawmen got me running now forever more
They'll hunt me down until the end of time
Oh my mama, now I've got to go
Never love another how I've loved you so
I'm so afraid to leave this all behind

[2x]
All my love Anastasia, Anastasia
This may be our last goodbye
You can't save me, I am fading
Blood is on my hands tonight

[Solo]

All my love Anastasia, Anastasia
This may be our last goodbye
You can't save me, I am fading
Blood is on my hands tonight

Anastasia, Anastasia
For you're all I took of life
You can't save me, I am fading
Blood is on my hands tonight

[Solo]
