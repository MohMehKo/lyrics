I was two years lost, so don't recall
Never did see the light
And if up to you
You know it's true
You probably wouldn't be alive

Had the Devil on our shoulder
With a death wish on our mind
Well the hounds of Hell
They knew us well
They were never too far behind

We were singing

Someday, we'll look back if we get out alive
It's a crazy life
Someday, we'll get out of this crazy life

You had long black hair
The Devils stare
Oh, you were a mystery
Always come around
To bring me down
Do a little bit for free

You couldn't get your shit together
Couldn't bring yourself to right
'cause it's hard to tell
When you're so unwell
If you're in Hell or paradise

We were singing

Someday, we'll look back if we get out alive
It's a crazy life
Someday, we'll get out of this crazy life

Sometimes it's hard to see it
When you're sucked down and reeling
So hard to pull back in from the tide
It's a crazy life

[Solo]

I was two years lost, so don't recall
Never did see the light
And if up to you
You know it's true
You probably wouldn't be alive

We were singing

Someday, we'll look back if we get out alive
It's a crazy life
Someday, we'll get out of this crazy life
We'll get out alive
