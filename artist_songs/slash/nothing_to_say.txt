We seem so lost and jaded
Well what a price to pay
Fear can be overstated
And you seem infatuated
with finding who's to blame

While it can seem so hard now
I got a feeling we ain't meant to live this way

Don't tell me it's too late
Cause I feel it too, we all love to hate
And let others lead the way

Some searching to find
That love with a new piece of mind

And still we march further away
Singing our songs of yesterday
While so much still stands in our way
Voices with nothing to say

Some feel that life's a favour
While some don't have the time
Wash up and kiss the alter
All hail the mighty father
but love will keep you blind

Same questions we keep asking
Won't hear the answers cause we're scared of what we'll find

We try and compensate through our troubled faith that should keep us safe
And keep searching for a sign

Some searching to find
That love with a new piece of mind

And still still we march further away
Singing our songs of yesterday
While so much still stands in our way
Voices with nothing to say

There wont be another day, no changing of the seasons
And no one's gonna save us from the lies.

The greatest story ever told
Is only what you make it
There will be struggle and fear
All by design

And still we march further away (We've been so logicated)
Singing our songs of yesterday (Nothing's got all the point, the blame?)
While so much still stands in our way (Yeahhhh!)
Voices with nothing to say
