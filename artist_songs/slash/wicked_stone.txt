Last night in paradise
I can feel it down in my bones

Left the good Lord behind
Now I die on the vine
Waiting for my redemption song

I am never safe
Just a walking bomb

In a midnight rage
And I'm gone

I'm getting off this wicked stone
'Cause I can't stay and I can't deny that

All I want is lost
No I can't face another night on this wicked stone

I rolled and tumbled down
And I cursed till the morning light 

From the mountain I fell
To the depths of a hell
I was destined and born to find

Once a rolling stone
Now a falling star

Once so close to home
Now so far

I'm getting off this wicked stone
'Cause I can't stay and I can't deny that

All I want is lost
No I can't face another night on this wicked stone

Now you might say I'm good for nothing
And I might say that you are right 

Cannot crawl away 
From this ball and chain
It's got me tethered to a world of pain 

I'm digging my own grave this time
On this wicked stone tonight

I'm getting off this wicked stone
'Cause I can't stay and I can't deny that 

All I want is lost
No I can't face another night on this wicked stone
