A shadow life 
Will only break your heart
It steals the light 
And tears a soul apart
Like a shadow in the dark

I know you're living in a shadow life
Better watch your step
Should you stumble
You're gonna fall

'Cause dirty secrets are the killing kind
Rope around your neck
It's a wonder 
You breathe at all

You turn a blind eye and I hold on
You're a fool, will it ever change?
Why can't you ever see?

The shadow life 
Will only break your heart
Like I said before

It steals the light 
And tears us all apart
Like a shadow in the dark

I can feel it when you're under me
There is something else
There is something I can't let go

Never silence to the misery
Feel it in your sex
Every time that we're all alone

And still you just deny it all
But I can't take this anymore
But I can turn away

The shadow life 
Will only break your heart
Like I said before

It steals the light 
And tears us all apart
Like a shadow in the dark

It's coming
It's coming
It haunts us and tears us apart 

Just like a shadow in the dark

You're a shadow in the dark

The shadow life 
Will only break your heart
Like I said before

It steals the light 
And tears us all apart
Like a shadow in the dark 

I feel it when you're under me
There's a dirty secret to this misery, yeah

The shadow life 
Will only break your heart
Like a shadow in the dark

You're a shadow in the dark
