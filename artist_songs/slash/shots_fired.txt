If I could stand for something
I would turn the bitter tide
I would turn it on the pain I've come to know
And calm the storm that never dies

I'm hearing
Shots fired
Out of range
They wanna see me in a blood soaked grave
But still I live to die another day

I can feel it from a distance
All the venom and the spite
It's not enough for though I've given them my all
Impossible to satisfy

I'm hearing
Shots fired
Out of range
They wanna see me in a blood soaked grave
But still I live to die another day

Shots fired
Out of range
They wanna see me in a blood soaked grave
But still I live to die another day

Another day
For I've heard it all before
It's all in vain
You won't shoot me down

Shots fired
Out of range
They wanna see me in a blood soaked grave
But still I live to die another day

Shots fired
Out of range
They wanna see me in a blood soaked grave
But still I live to die another day
