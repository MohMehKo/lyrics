Like a prophet of doom I've come to show the way
I'm the Devil you keep inside
'Cause it's all I can do to stay solid and remain
Watching all of your days pass you by

But the time has come
To throw your halo down
We may never live forever
So you better live for now
Don't deny it
What you need ain't in the clouds
Here it comes, here it comes
Time to dirty up your halo

Could be living so hard, but you waste your life away
Still afraid to be what you are
Still I beg you to try to start loving for today
'Cause regrets gonna bury your heart

But the time has come
To throw your halo down
We may never live forever
So you better live for now
Don't deny it
What you need ain't in the clouds
Here it comes, here it comes
Time to dirty up your halo

You will not obey, you will not obey - defy it
I will lead the way, I will lead the way to burn you down

[Solo]

But the time has come
To throw your halo down
We may never live forever
So you better live for now
Don't deny it
What you need ain't in the clouds
Here it comes, here it comes
Time to dirty up your halo

Put down your halo
Put down your halo

Here it comes, here it comes
Time to dirty up your halo now
