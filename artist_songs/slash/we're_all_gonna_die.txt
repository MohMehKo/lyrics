Gee, I really like your tits
I'll say anything that fits
We carry our vision
Wherever we go
If you keep your mouth shut
It's still gonna show

We're all gonna die
So let's get high
We're all gonna die
So let's be nice
I'm in the mood
So let's intrude
Pee on the ground
And jump around

I'm getting sick of paying bills
I need my doctor, I need my pills
We carry our women
Wherever we go
If you keep their mouth shut
They're gonna moan
(Mhm)

We're all gonna die
So let's get high
We're all gonna die
So let's be nice
I'm in the mood
So let's intrude
Pee on the ground (heh heh)
And jump around

Life is demanding
But I'm just a bum
And if I respect it, boy
I feel dumb!

[SOLO]

We're all gonna die
So let's get high
We're all gonna die
So let's be nice
I'm in the mood
So let's intrude
Pee on the ground
And jump around

We're all gonna die!

(We're all gonna die)
[Laughing]
(We're all gonna die)
(I wanna, I wanna, I wanna whip it out and pee on the ground!)
(We're all gonna die)
