A kingdom lost
A ransom paid
A dying wish 
You got your way

Your foolish pride
A bitter rage
Brought to dust
And laid to waste
Your empire lost with nothing gained
How could you let it fall?

Now it’s all been decided
There is nothing you can do
You’re too far gone

But it's always the same old song
There ain’t nothing left to prove
You’re too far gone

Burn your bridges to the ground
Throw your tantrums
Scream out loud 

Play the martyr
Play the fool
Tell the world it wasn’t you
Who pulled the trigger in the end
Like you know you always do

‘Cause it’s all been decided
There is nothing you can do
You’re too far gone

But it's always the same old song
There ain’t nothing left to prove
You’re too far gone

A kingdom lost
A ransom paid
A dying wish 
You got your way 

A kingdom lost
A ransom paid
Now you can see 
That you’re to blame

Now it’s all been decided
There is nothing you can do
You’re too far gone

But it's always the same old song
There ain’t nothing left to prove
You’re too far gone
You’re too far gone
You’re too far gone
