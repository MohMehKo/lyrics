Evil 
Shadows they are falling
And the misty eyed are calling
To a god so far

People
Troubled times are coming
Still you wonder why I’m running
I will take no part

I know it was you this time
I know it was you this time 
I’ve seen it with my own two eyes
You lied
You lied

Unholy
So vile
How can you justify a lie?
One more sacred alibi

Concealing 
Your crimes
Until the end of time
Oh why
It’s you that should be crucified

Echoes 
Of your true intentions
Well I guess you failed to mention
What was in your heart

Now I 
See it all so clearly
What you did to them has nearly
Torn us all apart

I know it was you this time
I know it was you this time 
I’ve seen it with my own two eyes
You lied
You lied

Unholy
So vile
How can you justify a lie?
One more sacred alibi

Concealing
Your crimes
Until the end of time
Oh why
It’s you that should be crucified

You say on your knees
If you don’t believe 
Now
Don’t question a thing at all

Just receive 
What you’re meant to see
Now fall
On your knees

Evil 
Shadows they are falling
And the misty eyed are calling
You will break their heart

Unholy
So vile
How can you justify a lie?
One more sacred alibi

Concealing
Your crimes
Until the end of time
Oh why
It’s you that should be crucified

The broken 
How they cry
They only gave you heart and mind
How can you justify?
They loved you

Oh father 
Don’t deny
You took them like a sacrifice
We finally know the truth about you

You’re unholy
So vile
How can they justify
Oh my
How they loved you 
Concealing 
Your crimes
But now they see this time
The blind
We will deny you
