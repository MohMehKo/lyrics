So the story goes
This is a tale that must be told
For what could be your destiny
You never know

I never meant to be here
I never even tried
But until you know 
When you’re lost and down
You come to trouble in time 

It was a cold December
A rip city night
In a steel toe rage
Made a big mistake
Now I’ll be doing time

I was running with the order
I was running out of time
Now for me there is no quarter
I don’t want to be here
I don’t want to die

Serving 30 years to life
What I did I can’t deny
Now the sorrow in my heart will never fade

I remember it so well
The night I sent that boy to Hell
Lord, I’m sorry for the error of my ways

They sent me on a mission
Out to earn my stripes
Should have known damn well 
When the curb stomp fell
Things would never be right

I was running with the order
I was running out of time
Now for me there is no quarter
I don’t want to be here
How many nights I've cried

Serving 30 years to life
What I did I can’t deny
Now the sorrow in my heart will never fade

I remember it so well
The night I sent that boy to Hell
Lord, I’m sorry for the error of my ways

‘Cause now I know
Now I know
I was wrong and I can’t let this go

I know
Now I know
I am sorry
What a wretched soul
What a big mistake

Now I’m growing old
18 years or more to go
I waste way in this cage
I’m all alone 

That’s how the story goes
This is a tale that must be told
For what could be 
Your destiny
You never know

‘Cause when you’re running with the order
You’re only running out of time
Now for me there is no quarter
I didn’t want to be here
I don’t want to die

Serving 30 years to life
What I did I can’t deny
Now the sorrow in my heart will never fade

My regret I know it well
But it’s too late to save myself
Lord, I'm sorry for the error of my ways

So the story goes
This is a tale that must be told
For the sorrow in my heart will never fade

So the story goes
This is a tale that must be told
Yes I’m sorry for the error of my ways
