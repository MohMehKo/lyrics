And it's not that I'm afraid to die
I stand up for my own

There is something that I can't deny
Deep within my soul

Don't believe at all
In what we're fighting for
And I can see that we were wrong

And though the bombs keep falling in the dead
Of the night
I'm singing
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I guess I've never stopped believing that love can survive
I'm singing
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Father said
It's time to be a man
To serve for what you've known

But my father does not understand
My conscience won't let go

Don't believe at all
In what we're dying for
Now I can see that we were wrong

And though the bombs keep falling in the dead of the night
I'm singing
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I guess I've never stopped believing that love's still alive
I'm singing
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Wanna turn away
Wanna turn and walk away
And just leave it all

'Cause it's not my place
No it's not our place to stay

And though the bombs keep falling in the dead of the night
I'm singing
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I guess I've never stopped believing that love can survive
I'm singing
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
And though the bombs keep falling in the dead of the night
I'm singing
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I guess I've never stopped believing that love's still alive
I'm singing
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

I'm not afraid to die
I stand for my own
Oh
But I can't deny
That we are so wrong
Oh
