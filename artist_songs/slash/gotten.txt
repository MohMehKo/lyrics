So nice to see your face again
Tell me how long has it been
Since you've been here (since you've been here)?
You look so different than before
But still the person I adore
Frozen with fear

I'm out of love but I'll take it from the past
All out of words 'cause I'm sure it'll never last

And I've been saving
These last words for
One last miracle
But now I'm not sure
And I can't save you if
You don't let me
You just get me
Like I never been gotten before

Maybe it's the bitter wind
A chill from the Pacific rim
That brought you this way (that brought you my way)
Do not make me think of him
The way he touched your fragile skin
That haunts me everyday

I'm out of love but I can't forget the past
I'm out of words but I'm sure it'll never last

And I've been saving
These last words for
One last miracle
But now I'm not sure
And I can't save you if
You don't let me
You just get me
Like I never been gotten before
Like I never been gotten before

So nice to see your face again
But tell me will this ever end?
Don't disappear

And I've been saving
These last words for
One last miracle
But now I'm not sure
I can't save you if
You don't let me
You just get me
Like I never been gotten before
Like I never been gotten before
