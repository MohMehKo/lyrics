Through the miles
I cannot escape
My fate I know will come in time
With my back to the wind
I cheat it again
With a smile

Forged in blood
Billowing up
The truth I cannot speak
But I made it back
One last time

Avalon
It's been way too long
I can see in your eyes
The fire is all but gone

Tales untold
Never to know
Unspeakable until the end
All these mysteries
I'll never speak of again

But my love
I hope you believe
Now I'm gonna give you every part of me
I am home

Avalon
It's been way too long
I can see in your eyes
The fire is all but gone

But please keep holding on
Stay
Tonight
I need your love

Don't
Say
Goodbye
My sweet Avalon

Avalon
It's been way too long
I can see in your eyes
The fire is all but gone

My sweet Avalon
It's been way too long

Avalon
It's been way too long

Avalon
