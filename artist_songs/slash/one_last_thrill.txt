My life it feels just like a never-ending Monday morning
Somebody wake me from this nightmare
Will it ever end?
No, I don't like it
No color in the sky, the same old tired situation
Stuck in the place I can't escape
I've been here way too long
All this monotony has gotten me nowhere
But doubt I'm reckless and on fire

I still remember
We did whatever
We had it all when we were young and free
Was never better, those were the best of times

One last thrill and always
It seemed to feel so right
What I'd give for one taste
Of one last thrill before I die

I go to work, the boss is clamoring for my attention
Another monologue I've heard a million times before
No, I'm not lying
I'm bored to death as I can beg it since I don't remember

It's like a promise, like a suicide I can't endure
Whenever I don't get any time I think I'm gonna die
I'm reckless and on fire

I still remember
I did whatever
I had it all when I was young and free
Was never better, those were the best of times

One last thrill and always
It seemed to feel so right
What I'd give for one taste
Of one last thrill before I die

I wanna feel what I felt before
I wanna know there's something more
'Cause the Devil down in me, it never dies
I wanna revel in ecstasy
I want that drug down at me
Wanna live just like I'm dying
I don't wanna let this moment pass me by
I wave bye bye bye

[Solo]

One last thrill and always
It seemed to feel so right
What I'd give for one taste
Of one last thrill before I...

One last thrill and always
It seemed to feel so right
What I'd give for one taste
Of one last thrill before I die
