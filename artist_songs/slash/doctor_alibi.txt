I went to see the doctor
He said you're pretty sick
You got some real bad habits
You'd better stop right quick

I said doctor that's real bad news
Don't know what I'm gonna do

Doctor
There's nothin' wrong with me
Doctor doctor
Can't you see
Doctor
I ain't gonna die
Just write me an alibi

I went to see a shaman
He said you'll be alright
Just keep doin' what you love
Every single night

I said that's what I need to hear
Took away my childish fears

Doctor
You're a stand up guy
Doctor doctor
My oh my
Doctor
You're the one for me
That's the mojo that I need

Don't you know that I feel alright
Doin' what I do
I ain't gonna tow the line
Not till' I turn blue
All I got is one short life
That's what people say
And I ain't gonna waste a second
Doin' what you say

[SOLO]

I won't be the one you like
I won't be the boy next door
I won't be the chosen one
That's not what I'm here for
I don't like the way you are
I despise what you hold dear
Don't you try to make me change
I'll haunt you for a thousand years

Doctor
Don't you talk that way
Doctor
Don't you mess my day
Doctor
Stay away from me
Sick is what I'd rather be
Doctor
Doctor doctor death
Doctor
Doctor out of breath
Doctor
I ain't gonna die
Just write me an alibi
