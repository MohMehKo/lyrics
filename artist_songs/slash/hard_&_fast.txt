I don't want it
Don't need anymore
You got me lying on the killing floor tonight

I'm on eleven
Been up for days

It's gonna bring me to an early grave
This life
So I've got to go
You won't change my mind

Cause I can't survive
Another night in the white room
Cause a tiny bit
It always turns to more

And these bloodshot eyes got to say goodbye
I had my fun
But I can't deny
Living hard and fast
I'll never last beside you

My skin is crawling
I'm a shell of myself
You come a roaring like a bat out of hell
That's right
Every fucking time

Well come on lover
Won't you give it a rest
I'm never gonna make it out of this mess alive

So I've got to go
Got to say goodbye

Cause I can't survive
Another night in the white room
Cause a tiny bit
It always turns to more

And these bloodshot eyes got to say goodbye
I had my fun
But I can't deny
Living hard and fast
I'll never last beside you

Cause I can't survive
Another night in the white room
Cause a tiny bit
It always turns to more

And these bloodshot eyes got to say goodbye
I had my fun
But I can't deny
Living hard and fast
I'll never last beside you
