I wanna sail into the calm
Where the skies of blue are never gone 

But the rain keeps coming down
Tell me will it ever stop?

These waters rage, but I'll stay strong

Into the iris of the storm
Rise and full with the tide
Carry on

Sometimes it's hard to find my place
To face the fears that I must face 

But I keep on holding on
I wont let this take me down

I'll risk it all 
To find my way

Into the iris of the storm
Rise and full with the tide
Carry on

'Cause there will come a day
I know it wont be long
I'm gonna prove to the world that I belong

No more hurting
Skies are breaking
The tide is turning
I can feel it changing

Into the iris of the storm
Rise and full with the tide
Carry on

Into the iris of the storm
Show the world that I was right 
All along
