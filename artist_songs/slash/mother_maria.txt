For everyone I loved and every road I've known
For all the trash I won
I celebrate... alone
Sit up straight, stupid, bite your tongue
The best that I am is said and done

Screams and whispers
Tell her I no longer hear her!

Mother Mary, she don't talk to me
Mother Mary, she don't talk to me
"Give her my apologies"
"And tell her not to cry"
Mother Maria

I holler like a king trying to keep his throne
But chewing on a stone is the only thing I own
Drugs and lovers
Nothing left under the covers

[Chorus:]
Mother Mary, she don't talk to me
Mother Mary, she don't talk to me
"Give her my apologies"
"And tell her not to cry"
Mother Maria

Anything you want
Anything you need
I give it all I got
Your attention please!
You never want it me
You never wanted me!

Sleep with me
Just for the bitter part
About me

[Slash SOLO]

Living's hardly
Living's hardly
Tell her I no longer want it

[Chorus:]
Mother Mary, she don't talk to me
Mother Mary, she don't talk to me
"Give her all apologies"
It's Mother Mary, she don't talk to me!

I still don't hear her voice
I still can't hear her voice
I don't deserve her
So tell her not to cry
Tell her not to cry
Tell her not to cry!
Mother Maria
