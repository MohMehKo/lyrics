Took a shot in the dark
Though the aim was true
Still it missed the mark
As we wait for a hero we can't find
Now I know, now I realize
It's a hard line
Once you cross you're on your own
But I won't lie, I'm not satisfied
We can't wait much longer

When your heroes, turn to the enemy
And there's nothing left to hold
When your heroes, give only apologies
I won't deny it leaves me cold

Once again, you let us fall
Still you ease our minds and assured us all
In the end, everything's gonna be alright
But they won't
Now I realize, these are hard times
We can't fight them on our own
But I won't lie, I'm not satisfied
Who will save tomorrow?

When your heroes, turn to the enemy
And there's nothing left to hold
When your heroes, give only apologies
I won't deny it leaves me cold

Hope we're still alive
Still alive
Oh, oh, oh
We're still alive
Still alive in the end

[Solo]

Now I know
Now I realize, these are hard times
We can't face them on our own
But I won't lie, I'm not satisfied
Who will save tomorrow?

When your heroes, turn to the enemy
And there's nothing left to hold
When your heroes, give only apologies
I won't deny it leaves me cold

When your heroes, turn to the enemy
And there's nothing left to hold
When your heroes, give only apologies
I won't deny it leaves me cold

If we're still alive
Still alive
Oh, oh, oh
If we're still alive
I would never doubt you again
