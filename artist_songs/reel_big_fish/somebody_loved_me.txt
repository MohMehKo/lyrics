All of my friends- they’re not my friends
A knife in the back, felt it again. What did I do? Was it so wrong?
I used to fit in, now I don’t belong

I think somebody loved me once, I think somebody loved me once
I think somebody loved me once but I cannot remember why

My confidence is stuck in my throat when you lay blame I’m your scapegoat
Ears burnin’ red, I heard what you said- you smile at my face but you wish I was dead

I think somebody loved me once, I think somebody loved me once
I think somebody loved me once but I cannot remember why
