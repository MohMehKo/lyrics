You say, I do everything the wrong way
Why don't I do it your way
Then maybe someday
I'll be just like you

But I say, I'm gonna do it my way
The "I might fail but I'll try" way
Well that's been done but it's ok
I'll do what I wanna do

Cause' I don't want
To live your dream,
I don't want to live your dream

No way, I'll take my chances this time
I've gotta go and live life
And I won't let you try and take mine
I just won't let you

Cause' I don't want
To live your dream,
I don't want to live your dream
I won't change what I believe
I won't change what I believe

So try to hold me if you want
Try to control me if you want
But you won't keep me down
I'm not your clown
I've got to find my own way now
So try to hold me if you want

But I say, I'm gonna do it my way
The "I might fail but I'll try" way
Well that's been done but it's ok
I'll do what I wanna do

Cause' I don't want
To live your dream,
I don't want to live your dream
I won't change what I believe
I won't change what I believe

You say, I do everything the wrong way
