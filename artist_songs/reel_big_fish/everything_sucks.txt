there's a ska band on my street, a little ska band
everybody thinks that they're so $#&%!# neat,
there was nothin' on the radio
was gonna make my own band, play my own shows
but that don't work so i' givin' up again,
she said she loved me cause i played guitar
that's ok, i didn't love her at all and i say...

i'm givin' up
i know everything sucks, and this is gonna be the last
time you hear me complain

well, i went down to the show
everybody was there, i didn't wanna go
cause everything they do is so $#&%!# cool, every
song is a hit and the girls like 'em too, i can't
do that so
i'm givin' up again...i don't know why i learned
to play guitar, nobody's gonna know who we are and
i say...

i'm givin' up
i know everything sucks
and this is gonna be
the last time you hear
me complain

she said, some day,
we'll get back
together maybe
she said, some day
things'll be much
better baby
but i don't believe her
and i don't think
i need her anymore...

i know everything sucks
and this won't be the last
time you hear me complain.
