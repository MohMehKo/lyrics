Why can't she make up her fuckin' mind
I'm just sittin' here wastin' so much time
I know it's my fault but it's not my problem anymore...
Some day, maybe she'll come back to me and
I'll say, "why don't you go fuck yourself"
But everybody's talkin', they know that I'm lyin'
She gave me everything... all I want is more...
I wrote this song for her. but it won't
Make up for anything. I know it's too late
So why do I wait? it's not my problem
Anymore...
Some day, maybe she'll come back to me and
I'll say, "why don't you go fuck yourself"
But everybody's talkin', they know that I'm lyin'
She won't do anything and I'll always wait for her...
Some day, maybe she'll come back to me and
I'll say, "why don't you go fuck yourself"
Everybody's talkin', they know that I'm lyin'
She gave me everything
But all I want is more
All I want is more
All I want is more
