Don't let me down (Gently)
If you have to let me down at all

Don't let me down (Gently)
If you have to let me down at all

Don't let me down (Gently)
If you have to let me down at all

I ain't callin' you familiar
I don't know your face that well
Not like that shaving mirror hanging up inside your cell

I didn't call you here to tell ya
I didn't call you here at all
Cause I'm talkin to myself again
And you're talkin' to the wall

Don't let me down (Gently)
If you have to let me down at all

Don't let me down (Gently)
If you have to let me down at all

Don't let me down (Gently)
If you have to let me down at all

It would be great to die together
On the first day of the year
Cause then we'd be quite legendary
Could you volunteer

I don't think of you
Do you ya think of me
Is that often or not at all
Well if you have to let me down
Then kick me to the floor

Don't let me down (Gently)
If you have to let me down at all

Don't let me down (Gently)
If you have to let me down at all

Don't let me down (Gently)
If you have to let me down at all

I'll say it's not true
The things they say we do
Oh, how can I explain
The pleasure and the pain
They're callin' us insane
Oh the miles of blood
The bad the good
Do you think you could
d-d-d-d-d-d-d woooo!

Ooooo!

Don't let me down (Gently)
If you have to let me down at all
[x5]

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Oh no!

At all
