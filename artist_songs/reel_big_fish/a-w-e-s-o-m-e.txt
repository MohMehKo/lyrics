Oh yeah!

Alright!

A-W-E-S-O-M-E! so A-W-E-S-O-M-E!

Like tattered sails,
The shreds of my heart in your fingernails
Open my mouth, but I can't get this out
It never fails, a bed of roses, and coffin nails
I hold my breath 'cuz I'm scared to death
We try to lie, and deny
but our secret isn't safe.

[Chorus:]
You're Awesome! So Awesome! You're everything I want in a girl
You're Crazy! Amazing! I'm everything that's wrong with the world
You're great, filled with hate and I can't escape

My lips are sore,
My heart is black to the very core.
This life of crime, I'll get used to it in time.
We keep it low, but I think they know
And our secret isn't safe.

[Chorus:]
You're Awesome! So Awesome! You're everything I want in a girl
You're Crazy! Amazing! I'm everything that's wrong with the world
Don't wait, procrastinate, it's not too late

You're radical!
You're radical!
You're radical!
You're radical. Yeah!

So so so so awesome.
So so so so awesome.

[Chorus:]
You're Awesome! So Awesome! You're everything I want in a girl
You're Crazy! Amazing! I'm everything that's wrong with the world
Don't wait, procrastinate, it's not too late
You're great, filled with hate,
And I can't escape!
And I can't escape!
And I can't escape!

SO AWESOME!
