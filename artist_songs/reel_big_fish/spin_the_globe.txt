Flick on the light switch 
It's your love light 
Why what a big hand you have 
Stick out your thumb-a-yeah-yeah 

Spin spin spin the globe and 
Put your finger on it 
Spin spin spin the globe and 
Point to where it stops 

Now read the Avald book for your amuzing 
Forget the fate above you head 
For you dont want to know what will provail! 

Spin spin spin the globe and 
Put your finger on it 
Spin spin spin the globe and 
Point to where it stops 

Now take a trip somewhere forget your fear 
Support some little pigmy kids 
Go home and forget that cheer... ahhh! 

Spin spin spin the globe and 
Put your finger on it 
Spin spin spin the globe and 
Point to where it stops 

Spin spin spin the globe and 
Put your finger on it 
Spin spin spin the globe and 
Point to where it stops 

Fly while the waiting miles are sufficial 
Who'd be right and who'd be wrong 
Do you just sit and play along boy, do you know? 

Spin spin spin the globe and 
Put your finger on it 
Spin spin spin the globe and 
Point to where it stops 

Spiiiin
