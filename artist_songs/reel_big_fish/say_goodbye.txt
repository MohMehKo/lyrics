i know you feel like a whore
working for a dream that isn't even yours
pleasing everybody but yourself
wouldn't you rather be
somewhere else with someone else
there's no reason to stay together
cuz it's all pain and no pleasure

it would feel so good
to say good-bye
when i'm with you i wanna die
and all that time
was such a waste
i never wanna see your face
i just wanna get the fuck away

we are falling apart
lost our soul and we lost our heart
we can't be saved by being smart
we are falling apart
there's no reason to keep this up
because it just hurts too much

it would feel so good
to say good-bye
when i'm with you i wanna die
and all that time
was such a waste
i never wanna see your face
i just wanna get the fuck away

maybe someday i will look back
and see the best days of my life
maybe someday i will miss you
but for now the end feels right...

it would feel so good
to say good-bye
when i'm with you i wanna die
and all that time
was such a waste
i never wanna see your face
i just wanna get the fuck away

i know you feel like a whore
working for a dream that isn't even yours...
