She calls out to the man on the street
sir, can you help me?
Its cold and Ive nowhere to sleep,
Is there somewhere you can tell me?

He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh think twice, cause its another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh think twice, cause its another day for you,
You and me in paradise

Just think about it
Think about it
Just think about it

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see shes been crying
Shes got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk but shes trying

Oh think twice, cause its another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh think twice, cause its another day for you,
You and me in paradise

Oh lord, is there nothing more anybody else can do
Oh lord, there must be something you can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
Cause she didn't fit in there

Oh think twice, cause its another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh think twice, cause its another day for you,
You and me in para-

Oh think twice, cause its another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh think twice, cause its another day for you,
You and me in para-paradise

Just think about it
Just think about it
Think about it
Just think about it
