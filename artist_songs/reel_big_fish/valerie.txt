Back when I met you I didn’t have a clue of the horrible agony you would put me
through
but now that we’ve done some time and I know who you are
You’re so full of shit how did it get so far?
well you ruined my life, you were never my friend
Alnd now all I can hope is that I’ll never see you again

Valerie- you make me wish I was dead
Valerie- you’re like a knife in my head
I’ll never ever be the same my life is ruined, you’re too blame
Every moment of the year we spent you pushed me further and further over the edge
Maybe you didn’t mean it ,maybe you’re sorry as well but I know that you are evil, you came
straight out of hell
Well you wasted my time, all of my money too
I never really hated until I met you

Valerie- you make me wish I was dead
Valerie- you’re like a knife in my head
I’ll never ever be the same my life is ruined, you’re to blame
Well you ruined my life, you were never my friend and now all I can hope is that I’ll never see
you again

Valerie- you make me wish I was dead
Valerie- you’re like a knife in my head
I’ll never ever be the same my life is ruined, you’re to blame
