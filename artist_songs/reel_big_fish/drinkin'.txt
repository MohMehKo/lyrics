she told me
that I was lame 
with her middle finger in my face
wont waste her time with such a loser
so now I wallow in regret
wanna do something right but I haven't yet
why do my endeavors end up in failure

I think I'll go out drinkin'
drinkin' all night long
cuz if I go out drinkin'
then I can stop thinkin'
bout how the world done me wrong

I guess I shouldn't feel so bad
ain't got much reason to feel so sad
'cept that I'm poor untalented and ugly
I know its like they always say
good times and bad will come our way
but theres only one thing that'll make this easier

I think I'll go out drinkin'
drinkin' all night long
cuz if I go out drinkin'
then I can stop thinkin'
bout how the world done me wrong

so wrong
I sing this song and nobody sings along
I've got a friend
he's in my hand
he understands
he said to me everything wont be so bad!

I think I'll go out drinkin'
drinkin' all night long
cuz if I go out drinkin'
then I can stop thinkin'
bout how the world done me wrong

I think I'll go out drinkin' (think I'll go out drinkin')
drinkin' all night long (drinkin' all night long)
cuz if I go out drinkin'
then I can stop thinkin'
about how the worlds done me 
how the worlds done me wrong (so wrong)
