Hey, where did we go the days when the rains came?
Down in the hallow we were playin' a new game
Laughin' and a runnin', hey, hey, skippin' an a jumpin'
In the misty morning fog with our hearts a thumpin'

And you, my brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

Now whatever happened, to Tuesday ... so slow
Goin' down the old man with a transistor radio
Standin' in the sunlight laughing, hiding 'hind the rainbow wall
Slippin' and a slidin', hey, hey, all along the waterfall

With you my brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing?
Shala, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ti dah
Just like that
Shala, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ti dah
C'mon
Shala, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ti dah
La ti dah

It's so hard to find my way now that I'm on my own
I saw you just the other day, my, how you have grown
Cast ..., Lord, sometime I'm overcome thikin' 'bout
Makin' love in the green grass behind, ...

With you my brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when, ah, we used to sing?
Shala, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ti dah
Just like that
Shala, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ti dah
Everybody
Shala, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ti dah

(Shala, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ti dah)
Shala, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ti dah
(La ti dah, la ti dah, la ti dah, la ti dah)
Shala, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ti dah
