you know I'm cool when all the guys
wanna be my friend, and every little
girl here wants to hold my hand but i
sold all of my songs i'm probably gonna
get sued but that's all right as long as
i get...yea and maybe you'll come and
see us when we get real big, maybe
you'll see us if we ever get another gig
cuz there's so many fish in the sea
and they all look like me i'm just a
little tiny fish that's all i'll ever be.
