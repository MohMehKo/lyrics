Guess what? 
They found out about me, You can’t count on me- I hate to be wrong
Guess what?
All those things I said- it wasn’t what I meant, I hate to lead you on

I’ve got a lot of bad things I wish that I had never done ‘cause they’re coming back, coming back to me now
And I’ve got a lot of bad things I wish that I had never done ‘cause they’re coming back, coming back to me now
Oh yeah- you’re not my friend, you don’t know me and I, I don’t care about you
I lied, 
and that’s the awful truth. Guess it was no use- I hate to be wrong
I lied,
the things inside your head, wishin I was dead- ‘cause I did you wrong 

I’ve got a lot of bad things I wish that I had never done ‘cause they’re coming back, coming back to me now
And don’t think I’ll feel guilty or that I’ll apologize ‘cause I got my way, and that means I was right
Oh yeah- I’m not your friend, you don’t know me, and I, I don’t care about… you.
Repeat
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah 
I’ve got a lot of bad things I guess that I should never have done ‘cause they’re coming back, coming back to me now
And don’t think I’ll feel guilty or that I’ll apologize ‘cause I got my way and that means I was right
Oh yeah, I’m not your friend, you don’t know me and I, I don’t, I don’t care about you.
