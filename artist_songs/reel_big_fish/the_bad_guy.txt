This is not a song about the one that got away
This is not a song about the girl who didn't love me
Once again I have made somebody cry
Once again, once again I am the bad guy
I am the bad guy

It's mean but I'm not sorry I let you down
It's mean but I'm not sorry I let you down
It's mean but I'm not sorry I let you down
Don't you wish I never came around

I didn't care that she'd do anything for me
I didn't care that she would sell her soul to serve me
And as the tears fall from the corners of her eyes
I walked away, I walked away cause I'm the bad guy
I am the bad guy

It's mean but I'm not sorry I let you down
It's mean but I'm not sorry I let you down
It's mean but I'm not sorry I let you down
Don't you wish I never came around

It's not funny
It's not funny at all, no no
But your misery, your pain
I'm gonna laugh about it all
Cause I'm the bad guy
I am the bad guy
I am the bad guy

It's mean but I'm not sorry I let you down
It's mean, oh yeah
It's mean but I'm not sorry I let you down
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

It's mean but I'm not sorry I let you down
It's mean but I'm not sorry I let you down
It's mean but I'm not sorry I let you down
Don't you wish I never came around
Don't you wish I never came around
Don't you wish I never came around
