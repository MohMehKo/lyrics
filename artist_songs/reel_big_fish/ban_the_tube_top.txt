You’re 17, evil and mean, comfy and cozy nowhere scene
You can’t deny the loser inside all of your bad taste won’t subside 

You’re outta sight keep me up at night you dress funny strapless and skin tight 
You’re outta sight you keep me up at night you make me crazy you wear it out of spite 
Ban the tube top tonight 
You’re magical mystery girl tick tock you don’t stop rockin’ my world
You give high fives to all the guys you let me know that I'm alive 

You’re outta sight keep me up at night you dress funny strapless and skin tight 
You’re outta sight you keep me up at night you make me crazy you wear it out of spite 
Ban the tube top tonight 
There's a party that were all invited to but I don't care because I hate everyone in school
I ignore all the girls but you 
Beautiful girl, ugly shirt you are a fashion red alert
But I can’t resist, you've never been kissed and I've never been in love like this

You’re outta sight keep me up at night you dress funny strapless and skin tight 
You’re outta sight you keep me up at night you make me crazy you wear it out of spite 
Ban the tube top tonight
