Let me point my finger in your nose
Whoa, its not funny, no no no no
I can you you lookin down her shirt
I can see you lifting up her skirt
Only gonna tell you once, only gonna tell you once

You better stay away from my girlfriend
You better stay away from her
I'm just giving warning so you get no broken bones
You better leave my girl alone

Well I bet you can understand what I say
Whoa, I'm really just playing
I can see you lookin down her shirt
I can see you lifting up her skirt
Only gonna tell you twice, ask you really really nice

You better stay away from my girlfriend
You better stay away from her
I'm just giving warning so you get no broken bones
You better leave my girl alone

Let me break your neck and crush your skull
Whoa, you never listen, no no no no
I can see you lookin down her shirt
I can see you lifting up her skirt
I've seen too much of you
I cant take much more of this

You better stay away from my girlfriend
You better stay away from her
I'm just giving warning so you get no broken bones
You better leave my girl alone
