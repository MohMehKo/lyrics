I used to hurry a lot, I used to worry a lot
I used to stay out till the break of day
But oh, that didn't get it, it was high time I quit it
I just couldn't carry on that way

Oh, I did some damage, you know it's true
Didn't know I was so lonely till I found you

You can go the distance
We'll find out in the long run, in the long run
We can handle some resistance
If our love is a strong one, is a strong one

People talkin' about us, they've got nothin' else to do
When it all comes down
We will still come through in the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you, it's a long run

You know I don't understand
Why you don't treat yourself better
Do the crazy things that you do
'Cause all the debutantes in Houston, baby
Couldn't hold a candle to you

Did you do it for love? Did you do it for money?
Did you do it for spite? Did you think you had to honey?

Who is gonna make it?
We'll find out in the long run, in the long run
I know we can take it
If our love is a strong one, is a strong one

Well, we're scared, but we ain't shakin'
We're kinda bent but we ain't breakin' in the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you it's a long run
Yeah, yeah, yeah in the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you it's a long run

Gonna find out, oh, we're gonna find out in long run
We're gonna find out, yeah, we're gonna find out in the long run
In the long run, yeah, yeah, yeah
Gonna find out, gonna find out in the long run
