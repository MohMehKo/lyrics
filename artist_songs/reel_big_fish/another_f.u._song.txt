Hey kids, its time to use the "F" word

Fuck fuck fuck fuck...

...living
Fuck dieing,
Fuck laughing
Fuck crying
Fuck this song,
But mostly Fuck You
Fuck love, hate and friends
Fuck following trends,
Fuck this song,
Can't wait till it ends.

Fuck everything,
But fuck you the most
Fuck everyone
But fuck you the most,
With a big rusty pole or a splintery post
Fuck you the most, fuck you

Fuck old school
Fuck new school
Fuck not cool
Fuck too cool
Fuck hip and ironically lame
Fuck giving advice
Fuck trying to be nice
Fuck you and you know who you are

Fuck everything,
But fuck you the most
Fuck everyone
But fuck you the most,
With a big rusty pole or a splintery post
Yeah, Fuck you the most, fuck you

Fuck you [repeat until the end]
