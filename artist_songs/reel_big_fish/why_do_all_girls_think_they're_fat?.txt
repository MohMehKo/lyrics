(1,2,3,4 - 1,2,3,4) Go!

There's a little girl
On my mind (little girl)
All the time (little girl)
There's always one (little girl)
Look what she's done

She makes me look at her thighs
You know I don't have to lie
But why can't I tell her
You know she's so beautiful
But why do all girls think they're fat?

Hey, hey, hey, she's so pretty
Hey, hey, hey, my friend
Hey, hey, hey, I feel stupid, again

She said "it's all right"
(She said) "Come over tonight"
(She said) "Mom's not home"
(She said) "I'm all alone."
She drove me back to her house
She pushed me down on her couch,
She said "Now it's all right"
"We're gonna be good friends"
"Cause' that kissin' only leads to the end"

Hey, hey, hey, she's so pretty
Hey, hey, hey, my friend
Hey, hey, hey, I feel stupid, again

Hey, hey, hey, she's so pretty
Hey, hey, hey, my friend
Hey, hey, hey, I feel stupid, again

Hey, hey, hey, she's so pretty
Hey, hey, hey, my friend
Hey, hey, hey, I feel stupid
