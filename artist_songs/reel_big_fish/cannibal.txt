I've got the brains
You're the body
And you're in my sights
I've a got a new set of problems
How to get you alone tonight
My head keeps revolving
I work so hard just to get a bite

Cannibal
Cannibal
Cannibal, Cannibal, Cannibal
Cannibal-oh-oh
Cannibal

Back to the game
To the subject
Sustenance is at stake
There's no accounting for taste
You've got yours, I'll get mine
I'll love you in my own way
And everything will be just fine

Cannibal
Cannibal
Cannibal, Cannibal, Cannibal
Cannibal-oh-oh
Cannibal

You've got a new set of problems
It's not your fault this time
Don't take this personally

Cannibal-oh-oh
Cannibal-oh-oh

Cannibal
Cannibal
Cannibal, Cannibal, Cannibal
Cannibal-oh-oh
Cannibal
