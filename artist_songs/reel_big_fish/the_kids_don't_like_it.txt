got some words, i don't know gonna sing'em
here i go wanna try not to be lame
wanna make you feel the same i just wanna be someone
don't you know we tried to
do something new
it may sound real good,
but i don't think we're
getting through because
the kids don't like it
had a hit, famous?, no
easy come, easy go, should be
happy with what i got,
should be happy but i'm not
i just wanna be someone
don't you know we tried to do
something it may sound real
good, but i don't think were
getting through
because the kids don't like it
i thought there'd come a day
when i'd run out of things to say
but now i know it's true no one
listens anyway and all we wanted
was to do somethin' new
it doesn't sound so good and
i don't think were
getting through because the
kids don't like it no they don't
like it at all, anymore
