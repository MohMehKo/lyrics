i guess it's not fair
for me to not care
but i don't, and that's why
you think i'm a great guy
but i want you and you want me too
and you need this, wanna give it to you
and i thought this time i'd say something new
i'll call you, i swear
so, next time be there
can't keep up, not more
should quit but, what for?
cause i want you and you want me too
and you need this, wanna give it to you
and i thought this time i'd feel something new
it's not cruel, i do like you
and i want you to feel that i do
well i want you and you want me too
and you need this wanna give it to you
and i thought this time i'd be someone true
yeah i want you and you want me too
and you need this, wanna give it to you
and i thought this time i'd say something new
