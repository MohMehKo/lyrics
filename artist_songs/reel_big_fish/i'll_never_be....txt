Everybody's lookin' at me
Thought I saw my face on MTV
Or a magazine that she won't read,
Stole her heart, but it's not my
Fault, lookin' at
My picture she forgot about her
Boyfriend, yea.

I'll never be...a rock and roll star
I'll never be...anything, anything at all,
Drives me crazy, can't get away,
Somebody tell me...when do we get paid?

Everybody's lookin' at me
Thought by now I'd be on MTV
Or a magazine like seventeen or rolling stone,
And I won't be alone with your
Money in my pocket and face on your t-shirt yea.

I'll never be...a rock and roll star
I'll never be...anything, anything at all,
Drives me crazy, can't get away,
But I try and I try and I try and I try
Every day
Every day
Said I'll never be,
A rock and roll star
I'll never be...
Anything, anything at all.
