The old days were no fun
Im not sorry that they're gone
I don't miss them and I won't miss them 
and it was always wrong 
Everything I've ever done 
From the beginning and to the ending
and things never got better, it seems like forever
Since we had fun or maybe I never have fun

And this whole time! I've been around
One minute up!
and a hundred down uhhh ohhh

Keep on laughing, Keep attacking
I'll show you what it means
To keep on lying, Keep denying
That there's nothing good in me
I'm not worthless, I know you heard this 
My life's a joke and the joke's on me
The joke's on me

You were always lame, a headache and a pain
I don't miss you and I won't miss you
I tried not to get bitter but I was such a quitter
Oh yeah I had dreams but they were only ever bad dreams

And this whole time! I've been around
One minute up!
and a hundred down uhhh ohhh

Keep on laughing, Keep attacking
I'll show you what it means
To keep on lying, Keep denying
That there's nothing good in me
I'm not worthless, I know you heard this
My life's a joke and the joke's on me
The joke's on me, The joke's on me...

Well there never were any good old days
Looking back I'm still amazed
How everything went wrong in every way
There were no good old days 

Well there never were any good old days
Looking back I'm still amazed
That everything went wrong in every way
There were no good old days
[2x]

And this whole time! I've been around
One minute up!
and a hundred down uhhh ohhh

Keep on laughing, Keep attacking
I'll show you what it means
To keep on lying, Keep denying
That there's nothing good in me
I'm not worthless, I know you heard this
My life's a joke and the joke's on me...
