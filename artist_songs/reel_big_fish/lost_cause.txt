Last time you checked I was a nervous wreck
Lost out at sea the waves crashing on me without you

And now I see that you're so far from me
Not even here in spirit but all the memories still haunt me

And now I think about the good times we could've had
But how they all got drowned in an ocean of bad
Well I wanna get angry but it's just too sad
That you're givin' us away
How can you really say

That we're a
Lost cause 
And you're givin' up on me
Do you really think I'm not worth all the
Trouble that I've been causin to you
Do you really think it's a lost cause
Do you really think it's a lost cause
You and me

And where the story goes
Well I would like to know
We're no longer on the same page
We're not even in the same book

Is it too late
To be worth the wait
Have we run out of time
Or is there a minute to take a second look

Now it's not my fault
But I'll take the blame
I wanna go back and change everything
But if it was all different would you feel the same
And not be givin' us away
But I still hear you say

That we're a
Lost cause 
And you're givin' up on me
Do you really think I'm not worth all the
Trouble that I've been causin to you
Do you really think it's a lost cause
Do you really think it's a lost cause
You and me

And if this is how it ends well then that's a shame
I drove you crazy and you drove me insane
We found a new meaning of hurt and pain
We have beat this love to death
So we're both murderers, I guess

We're a
Lost cause 
And you're givin' up on me
Do you really think I'm not worth all the
Trouble that I've been causin to you
Do you really think it's a lost cause
Do you really think it's a lost cause

Lost cause 
And you're givin' up on me
Do you really think I'm not worth all the
Trouble that I've been causin to you
Do you really think it's a lost cause
Do you really think it's a lost cause
Do you really think it's a lost cause
You and me

You and me
You and me
You and me
All a lost cause
