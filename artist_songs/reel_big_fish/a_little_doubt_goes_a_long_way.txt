I gotta go gotta go gotta go before I do something stupid I gotta go
Gotta go gotta go gotta go before I do something lame 
I know it's your fault that I’m in the mess I’m in 
And you think I’m cool but I don’t man 
Maybe its too soon but I think it's too late 
And things like bad timing just won’t wait 
Maybe it's not right (I have a girlfriend) made a friend tonight (who is a girl and)
I just wanted to talk you but then I started wondering if she's the one, or not 

So I gotta go, gotta go, gotta go before I do something stupid 
I gotta go, gotta go, gotta go before I do something lame 
I know that flirting is nothing and it should be where it ends 
But I know yes I know that I want you for more than a friend 
Maybe it's not right (I have a girlfriend) made a friend tonight (who is a 
girl and) I just wanted to talk you but then I started wondering if she's the one 

So I gotta go, gotta go, gotta go before I do something stupid but I know,
I know it's too late
