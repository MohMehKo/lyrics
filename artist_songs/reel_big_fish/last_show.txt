This is the Last Show
I will ever play with you
this is the end of what you put me through
the Last Show i will ever play with you
this is the end of what we do...

I don't want fame, i don't want money
I just want to have fun again
I don't want girls, or backstage parties
I just want to feel like we're friends
I think i've learned my lesson
I think i've figured this whole thing out
this is a fine profession
but it's no fun
so i'm done

This is the Last Show
I will ever play with you
this is the end of what you put me through
the Last Show i will ever play with you
this is the end of what we do...

I never thought i would hate music
I never thought i would hate you
but every day this feels more like a job i don't even want to do
I think i've learned my lesson
I'll NEVER follow my dreams again
I wont waste any more of your time
so kiss my ass
I wont be back

This is the Last Show
I will ever play with you
this is the end of what you put me through
the Last Show i will ever play with you
this is the end of what we do...

did we do it for the money?
did we do it because we were bored?
I was better off with what i had before
and that was nothing
that was
nothing
at
all...

This is the Last Show
I will ever play with you
this is the end of what you put me through
the Last Show i will ever play with you
this is the end of what we do

this is the last song
this is the last line...goodbye.
