Hear the monkey boy
Monkey boy

Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
Hugging up the big monkey man
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
Hugging up the big monkey man

I never saw you, I only heard that you
Were hugging up the big monkey man
I never saw you, I only heard that you
Were hugging up the big monkey man

It's alright, it's alright
Hugging up the big monkey man
It's alright, it's alright
Hugging up the big monkey man

Now I know that, now I understand
You're turning the monkey on me
Now I know that, now I understand
They're turning the monkey on me

Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
Hugging up the big monkey man
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
Hugging up the big monkey man

Right on time with your monkey boy
La la la
La la la

...
He rings on his fingers, bells on his toe
He'll sing a little song, wherever he go

'Cause he's a monkey, he's a monkey man
Really, really, really, really monkey man
Yes he's a monkey, he's a monkey man
Really, really, really, really monkey man

Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
Hugging up the big monkey man
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
Hugging up the big monkey man
Hugging up on the monkey man
