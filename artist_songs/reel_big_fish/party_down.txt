Mama,
Daddy,
Baby Sis.
Tell your
Cousins
All about this.

Coming to you now,
From the Money Cow,
Living large in space.

Take your wallet out,
All the Dingos Shout,
"We'll eat your baby Mate!"

I'm upsetting you,
But i'm getting through,
I'm just sick of the same old something.
And you want me to stay but I am out the door.

Baking a cake!

We just came to party down!
Killing every scene around!
We just came to party hardy hardy hardy hardy!

Whoo hoo hoo!
Ooh ooh ooh!

She fell down the stairs,
Snakes eat Baby Bears,
Sharks are coming now.

Tearing off my flesh,
Are you getting fresh?
Slap me in the plough.

We like popsicles,
We have lost control,
I can't run 'cause i'm in slow motion.
The mechanical bulls are melting in the snow.

Flipper.... HURRAY!

We just came to party down,
Whee-ha!
Killing every scene around!
We just came to party hardy hardy hardy hardy.

We won't let you down,
We won't let you down.

We Just Need To Party Down!

Baking a cake!

We just came to party down,
Ah yeah, party down.
Killing every scene around.
We just came to party hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy!
