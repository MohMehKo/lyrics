Everybody's druuuunk
Everybody's drunk tonight
Everybody's druuuunk
Everybody's drunk tonight
Everybody's druuuunk
Everybody's drunk in here

Tonight's the night
We're gonna get plastered
Pissed off
Maybe even get laid, too
Booze on your breath
Always makes girls horny
So come on boys, let's
CHUG A FEW!

Everybody's druuuunk
Everybody's drunk tonight
Everybody's druuuunk
Everybody's drunk, oh yeah

People pouring
In the front door
Most of them
I've never seen in my life
I hear the sound of
Windows breaking
Who just lit the
Couch on fire?!

Everybody's druuuunk
Everybody's drunk tonight
Everybody's druuuunk
Everybody's drunk tonight!

And if you're coming here...
Don't forget to have
Yourself a beer!

There's two girls
Throwin' up in the bathroom
A good friend holds your head back
When you puke
Tonight's the night
So grab your whatever
Lift your something
Here's a toast to you!

WE'RE ALL GONNA GET DRUNK!
OH! WE'RE ALL GONNA GET DRUNK!
OH WAIT WE'RE ALREADY...
DRUUUUUNK!

Everybody's druuuunk
Everybody's drunk tonight
Everybody's druuuunk
Everybody's drunk, hoorah!

Fa la la la laaa la la!
