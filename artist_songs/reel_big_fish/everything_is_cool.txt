i'm so glad you're gone, you just led me on
where did it go wrong, too bad for too long
i live without you know
i'll get along some how
i don't care anyway, i just wanted to say
everything is cool
how are things with you
everything is cool
i wish you were dead
you say we'll be friends, that just means no sex,
i don't care what you say
i'm tired of %#&$!^ you anyway
i guess it is my fault
but do you blame you at all
i'll have to let you go
i just want you to know that
everything is cool
how are things with you,
everything is cool,
i wish you were dead!
