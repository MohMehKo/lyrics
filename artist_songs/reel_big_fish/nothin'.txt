everytime i try so hard i get
nothin' (nothin')
they say try and you won't fail, i
get nothin' (nothin')
i did all that i could i got nothin'
(nothin')
i tried so hard, for nothin' (nothin')
i never wanted it that way, guess
there was nothin' i could say
i don't know what i want. but i know
i don't want this
i give up, i give in, i know i'm
never gonna win
i know it's really not your fault
i'm gonna blame you anyway
you say you're sorry, but i know it
won't do no good
i give up, i give in, i knowi'm
never gonna win.

i don't $#&%!# care, i don't
$#&%!# care
i don't $#&%!# care anymore
it's gonna be all right
cause i don't $#&%!# care anymore.
