watchin' you sleep,
i'm lookin'
in your window,
everyday i drive past
your house
standin' in your front yard,
why don't you come out?
watchin' you sleep...nowhere to hide,
one of these days i'm gonna come inside
it must be love,
what else could it be?
$#&% you $!%&# i love you i'm not crazy!

walkin' up to her, now she's walkin' away
i just wanna talk to you!
maybe she's got better things to do
don't be afraid...to feel my touch,
don't worry babe i won't hurt you much.
it must be love
what else could it be?
$#&% you $!%&# i love you i'm not crazy!

i'm gonna make you love me!
i'm gonna make you love me!
i'm gonna make you love me!
no matter what you say, now here i come.
