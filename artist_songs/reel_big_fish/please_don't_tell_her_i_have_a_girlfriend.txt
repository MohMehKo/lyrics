Please don't tell her I have a girlfriend
Please don't tell her I have a girlfriend
Cause it's so hard
Can't even pretend
That I only want to be her friend

Well I don't deserve it
You know that it's true
But she said that she would
And you know I would to
Oh-oh
What am I gonna' do?

Please don't tell her I have a girlfriend
Please don't tell her I have a girlfriend
Cause it's so hard
Can't even pretend
That I only want to be her friend

Well I know that actions speak louder than words
And thinking is bad
But doing's much worse
Oh-oh
But I'm so perverse

Please don't tell her I have a girlfriend
Please don't tell her I have a girlfriend
Cause it's so hard
Can't even pretend
I only want to be her friend

Well I know I can keep a secret
I know I can keep a secret
Can you keep my secret?

Oh please don't tell her
That I have a girlfriend
Cause it's so hard
I can't even pretend

Please don't tell her I have a girlfriend
Please don't tell her I have a girlfriend
Cause it's so hard
Can't even pretend
That I only want to be her friend
