[verse]
well, I know you can't work in fast food all your life
but don't sign that paper tonight, she said,
but it's too late.

And I don't remember what I read, 
don't remember what they said, 
I guess it doesn't matter,
I guess it doesn't matter anymore.

[chorus]
you're gonna go to the record store
you're gonna give 'em all your money
radio plays what they want you to hear
they tell me it's cool but I just don't believe it...

sell out, with me oh yea, sell out, with me tonight
record company's gonna give me lots of money 
and everything's gonna be (all right).

[verse]
no more flippin' burgers puttin' on my silly hat 
you know I don't want that no more, 
And I didn't ask when we'd get paid, I quit my day job anyway, 
I guess it doesn't matter, I guess it doesn't matter anymore

[chorus]
You're gonna go to the record store, 
you're gonna give 'em all your money, 
radio plays what they want you to hear,
they tell me it's cool, I just don't believe it

sell out, with me oh yea, sell out
with me tonight, the records company's only give me
lots of money and everything's gonna be.

[bridge]
I don't think it'll be so bad
I know it won't be so bad
cause the man said "that's the way it is" 
and the man said "it don't get better than this" no no no noo

[chorus]
so I signed on to the record company,
they say they're gonna give me lot's of money,
if I play what they want you to hear
they tell me it's cool, and I sure believe it...

sell out, with me oh yea, sell out, with me tonight
the record companies gonna give me lots of money and
everything's gonna be (all right).
