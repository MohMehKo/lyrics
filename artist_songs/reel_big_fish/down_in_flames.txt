you don't know me but here i am in your living room
you don't own me but you paid and that means alot to you
you never listen but i know that's what you think that you do
and everybody wants a change but this time it'll be the same
watch us go down in flames its all right it's ok, it was gonna
happen anyway, we had our chance, made our point but your
not gonna take that...
radio, commercials, t.v. shows, front page, ads, photos, and
interviews they'll make sure it's the latest fad. pay attention, cuz
you know you'll have to pay either way and they tell you that its the
new thing. but we know that it hasn't changed. watch us go down in
flames it's all right, it's ok it was gonna happen anyway, we had our
chance, made our point but your not going take that... when this blows
over and the main stream coughs up another shell will you let us back in
your underground well i guess that's a no and it's just as well cuz you
never supported us, all you wanted was to see us fail and they tell me
that it's the new thing so i better get out of the way watch us go down
in flames it's all right it's ok it was going to happen anyway we had our
chance, made our point and your not gonna take that it's all right it's ok,
it was gonna happen anyway we had our chance made our point
you're not gonna take that away
you're not gonna take that away
you're not gonna take that away
you're not gonna take that away
