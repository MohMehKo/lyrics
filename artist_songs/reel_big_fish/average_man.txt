I just became a member of a club known as the bumbling fools
Botching the game and the best things in life is the motto and the rule
So if you can open up your heart and hear me out just for tonight
Baby I got something to prove to you
I've gotta show you I can do it right

[Chorus:]
Get out
Don't want to see you again
Maybe we can still be friends
I know that I'm gonna go and screw it up in the end
But that's okay cause I'm your average man

So I turned tail and ran
And I know you're not my biggest fan
But whatever you want me to
You know that I'm gonna do it now or do the best that I can
So if you can open up your heart and hear me out just one more time
Baby I've got something to say to you
I was wrong and the fault is mine

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Baby you could do a whole lot better
But you could definitely do a whole lot worse
How can I even try to do better
If you won't give me a chance to be better first

[Chorus]
