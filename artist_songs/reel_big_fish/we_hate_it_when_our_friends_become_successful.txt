We hate it when our friends become successful
We hate it when our friends become successful
Oh, look at those clothes
ah look at that face, its so cold
it's such a video, well
it's really laughable
Ah, ha, ha ...

We hate it when our friends become successful
And if they're No Doubt, that makes it even worse and
we can destroy them
You bet your life we will
destroy them
If we can hurt them
Well, we may as well ...
Its really laughable
Ah, ha, ha ...

You see it should've been me
could've been me
Everybody knows
Everybody says so
They say :

"ah, you have loads of songs
So many songs
More songs than they could stand
Verse
Chorus
Then they break away
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la
just Listen!

It's really laughable
