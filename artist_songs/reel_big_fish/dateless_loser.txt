We are all on our own with no one by our side
You are so lucky, beautiful and bright 
All the cool kids go steady they're making out at 12-
we sit in our rooms alone 
by ourselves it's Friday- no phone call, nobody asked us out 

We are the dateless losers- lonely until we die!
So unappreciated, why, why, why, why?

We’re not so bad you know, but you won’t give us a chance
Take us to the movies, to dinner, or to dance
Not perfect, not too hip- but we need lovin’ too 

We are the dateless losers- lonely until we die!
So unappreciated why, why, why, why?
