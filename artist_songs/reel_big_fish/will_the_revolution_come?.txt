Will the revolution come?
Well, that's what they all say
Will the revolution come?
Well then that will be the day
Will the revolution come?
Then put your fist in the air
Will the revolution come?
You better get out of your chair

Cause we won't wise up so how can we rise up
Tired of being enslaved
Will the revolution come?
Will anything change?

Will the revolution come?
Well I heard that before
Will the revolution come?
Well I'll try not to act too bored

Cause each generation's mess is bigger
Than the one before it has made
Will the revolution come?
Can we be saved?

Ooo ooo

Cause we won't wise up so how can we rise up
Tired of being enslaved
Will the revolution come?
Will anything change?

Will the revolution come?
You better not run and hide
Will the revolution come?
You gotta stand outside

Because the only place that is in our minds
The only change to our apathy
Will the revolution come?
Just wait and see
