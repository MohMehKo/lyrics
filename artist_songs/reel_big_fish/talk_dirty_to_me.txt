You know I never, I've never seen you look so good
You never act the way you should but I like it
And I know you like it too the way that I want you
I've gotta have you, oh yes I do

I never, I never ever stay out late
But you know that I can hardly wait just to see you
And I know you cannot wait, wait to see me too
I've gotta touch you

'Cause baby we'll be at the drive-in in the old man's Ford
Behind the bushes until I'm screamin' for more
Down in the basement we'll lock the cellar door
And baby talk dirty to me

You know I call you, I call you on the telephone
I'm only hoping that you're home so I can hear you
When you say those words to me and whisper so softly
I gotta hear you

'Cause baby we'll be at the drive-in in the old man's Ford
Behind the bushes until I'm screamin' for more
Way down in the basement we'll lock the cellar door
And baby talk dirty to me
So pick up that guitar and talk to me

'Cause baby we'll be at the drive-in in the old man's Ford
Behind them bushes till I'm screamin' for more, more, more
Way down in the basement we'll lock the cellar door
And baby talk dirty to me, yeah
And baby talk dirty to me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And baby talk dirty to me, yeah, yeah
