Looking out my window 
Nothing to do but to drive in circles 
Well, I don't want to have to go home tonight 

Up and down the boulevard 
How did I survive in suburbia 
When there's nothing to do 
And they take away what I love to do the most, yeah 

Friday night, you're not gonna get it 
Saturday, you try to give me one more 
Sunday morning, just waiting for the 
afternoon so I can be a kid again 

I head back to my backyard 
I know life's rough but sometimes it's really hard 
To do what I love to do the most, yeah 

Now I'm stuck, I'm back in the loop again 
I'm not gonna lose and I know I'm never gonna win 
Sometimes life is just that way 
We all say 

Friday night, you're not gonna get it 
Saturday, you try to give me one more 
Sunday morning, just waiting for the 
afternoon so I can be a kid again 

Friday night, you're not gonna get it 
Saturday, you try to give me one more 
Sunday morning, just waiting for the 
afternoon so I can be a kid again 

And now the weekend comes and I try to get inside 
But the guy at the door tells me that I'm denied 

Friday night, you're not gonna get it 
Saturday, you try to give me one more 
Sunday morning, just waiting for the 
afternoon so I can be a kid again 

Friday night 
Saturday 
Sunday morning, just waiting for the 
afternoon so I can be a kid again 

Friday night 
Saturday 
Sunday morning, just waiting for the 
afternoon so I can be a kid again 

Friday night, you're not gonna get it 
Saturday, you try to give me one more 
Sunday morning, just waiting for the 
afternoon so I can be a kid again 

You try to give me one more 
You try to give me one more 

Friday night 
Saturday 
Sunday morning, just waiting for the 
afternoon so I can be a kid again
