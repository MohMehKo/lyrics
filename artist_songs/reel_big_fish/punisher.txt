I shook your hand
I may have smiled
I was just tryin' to be nice
But you forced your way into my life

And now it's years from then
And you're still hangin' around
With no respect for personal space
You're always right there in my face

Callin' you a stalker is a little harsh
But that's almost what you are
You're always showin' up
When you're not invited
Here is something that I've finally decided

I gotta tell you
You're a punisher
You're unbearable
You are terrible

Punisher
You just torture us
And I have had enough

Punisher
You have got to go
How can you not know
That you drive me crazy
It's amazing how annoying you are

Now here you come again
Makin' yourself at home
But no one even likes you
Can't you get that through your skull

Don't you see the dirty looks
Don't you notice I don't keep in touch
You're pushy
You're pushy
You're pushy
And I've been pushed around too much

I guess you're too crazy to see
The nuisance that you are
But you have reached the end of my toleration
And now it's finally time for a confrontation

I gotta tell you
You're a punisher
You're unbearable
You are terrible

Punisher
You just torture us
And I have had enough

Punisher
You have got to go
How can you not know
That you drive me crazy
It's amazing how annoying you are

Callin' you a stalker is a little harsh
But that's almost what you are
You're always showin' up
When you're not invited
Here is something that we have finally decided

(I gotta tell you)
You're a punisher
You're unbearable
You are terrible

Punisher
You just torture us
And I have had enough

Punisher
You're unbearable
You are terrible

Punisher
You just torture us
And I have had enough

Punisher
You have got to go
How can you not know
That you drive me crazy
It's amazing that it went so far!

Punisher
You're a punisher!

Punisher
