Mama we're all crazy now 

I don't want to drink my whiskey like you do 
I don't need to spend my money but still do 

Well don't stop now, come on 
Another drop now, come on 
I want a lot now so come on 
That's why, that's why

Well you told me fool fire water won't hurt me 
(But you lied) 
And you tease me and all my ladies desert me 
(I'm gonna get 'em back) 

Don't stop now, come on 
I wanna lot now, come on 
Another drop now, come on 
That's why, that's why
