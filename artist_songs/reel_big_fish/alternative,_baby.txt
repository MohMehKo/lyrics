well, i see you up on stage and
i don't know just
what you're sayin', but you're my hero...
and a guy just kicked me in the head,
a little girl
just passed out dead, i'm in between a big jock
and a sweaty skinhead but i love you
whatever that means...but i don't wanna talk
to you, cause i know i'd just say some thing
stupid and i know you've got better things to do.

hey, little alternative girl
don't you wanna be my friend?
you know i'm singin' all my songs to you
it's all right if you don't understand.

maybe i shouldn't be so serious, tellin' you that
everything sucks cause i don't wanna bring
you down
but it never ever works out right, i'm gonna lose,
give up the fight, i won't get what i want
won't get anything but i love you...whatever
that means.
and they don't wanna talk to me cause they know
what i'll turn out to be, i said i was cool
but i can't lie to you (but i do)

hey, little alternative girl
don't you wanna be my friend?
you know i'm singin' all my songs to you
it's all right if you don't understand.

and i don't wanna start again cause i know
it'll be the same in the end
i didn't like it the first time anyway.
