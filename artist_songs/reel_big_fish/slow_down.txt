Slow down,
You got to slow down and
Take it easy

Slow down,
You got to slow down and
Take it easy Oh Yeah

Well you've been racing around and your bloods flowing fast and your heart starts to pound
Yeah you've been shaking the trees but no answers fall out just birds nests and leaves
You told that son of a bitch to get out of this place or you'd punch in his face
You threw the telephone down when the bad news came and then it stuck around

You've got to make it stop
Find a way to make that blood pressure drop, soooo

Slow down,
You got to slow down and
Take it easy, Oh Yeah

There will be times in your life when the roof falls in and the bed bugs bite
Those sweet dreams you heard about well you slept right through them what's that about
Cause of that snake in the grass well you never had such a pain in the ass
Yeah you tried speaking your mind but they got you convinced that its empty inside

You've got to make it stop
Find a way to make that blood pressure drop, soooo

Slow down,
You got to slow down and
Take it easy

Slow down,
You got to slow down and
Take it easy, Oh Yeah

You've got to make it stop
Find a way to make that blood pressure drop, soooo

Slow down,
You got to slow down and
Take it easy

Slow down,
You got to slow down and
Take it easy, Slow

Slow down,
You got to slow down and
Take it easy, Oh Yeah

Take it easy oh yeah!
