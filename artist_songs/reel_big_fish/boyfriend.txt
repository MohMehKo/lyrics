All the kids down in London, and everybody in New York City,
if they listen to that "Alternative", if they're fourteen and lookin' pretty,
They want me to be their Boyfriend, they want me to be their
Boyfriend... I can take you any place you wanna go, I can show you
anything you wanna see, I can be whatever you want me to be, I can
be whatever you want me to be...
All the girls in the back room, I wont miss 'em when they're gone,
don't you know there ain't nobody, you're the only one that turns me
on, don't you want me to be your Boyfriend? Don't you want me to be
your Boyfriend? I can take you any place you wanna go, I can show you
anything you wanna see, I can be whatever you want me to be...
