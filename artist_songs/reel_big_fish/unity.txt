There's a war goin' down between my brothers tonight.
I don't want no war goin' down tonight.

Civilization? Ha! I call it as I see it.
I call it &#!!$#!%! You know, I still cannot believe it
Our evolution now has gone the way of hate
A world evolved resolved into its stupid fate.
Stop this war!
All so different yeah, I say we're all the same
All caught, you know, in the division game.
Self destruction fast impending like a bullet.
No one can stop it, once it's fired no one can control it.
Stop this war
A final word, wait it's not a call to action
We ain't no sect, we ain't no $#&%!#& faction.
Unity, Unity, you've heard it all before,
This time it's not exclusive we want to stop a war.
Unity as one, stand together,
Unity, evolution's gonna come!
