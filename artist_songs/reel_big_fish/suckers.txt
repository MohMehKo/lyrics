Hey everybody I’ve got somethin’ to tell it's what I learned from relationship hell 
Lust turns to disgust a heart of gold into rust a soft touch to a slap in the 
face- it gets old it goes away

This one's for all the suckers who still believe in love, this one's for you. 
This one’s for all the suckers who still believe in love, this one’s for you.
It never works but we keep tryin' like fools learning and breaking the rules 
At first you're excited then you're less than delighted by the end you wish 
they would drop dead it can't last, it's gone so fast 

This one's for all the suckers who still believe in love, this one's for you 
This one’s for all the suckers who still believe in love, this one’s for you
