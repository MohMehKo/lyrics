I'm dancing to the beat in my head, in my head
I'm dancing to the beat in my head
I'm dancing to the beat in my head, in my head
I'm dancing to the beat in my head

I'm hiding in my headphones
Hiding in my headphones
Gunna turn them up so loud
Gunna drown this whole world out
I'm hiding in my headphones 
Hiding in my headphones
And everyone can see 
That they wont bother me
So get, out of, my way
Cuz I don't care what you have to say

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yah
Wooooooo
Yeah
Wooooooo
Yeah
Wooooooo
Yeah
Wooooooo
Yeah

I wake up in the morning
Turn the house beat
Step into the big ol world around me
And I hear the bustle fighting your scene
Hiding in myheadphones where you find me
Hey mister I don't mean to be rude
But its to early to have an attitude
So I turn up the volume take a journey
Hiding in my headphones thats where I'll be

No wanna hear the chetter of the buisness man
No wanna hear the jingle of the ice cream van
No wanna hear the flappin and the pigion coos
Not even wanna listen to the mornin news

Just dancing to the beat in my head, in my head
Just dancing to the beat in my head
Just dancing to the beat in my head, in my head
Just dancing to the beat in my head

I'm hiding in my headphones
Hiding in my headphones
Gunna turn them up so loud
Gunna drown this whole world out
I'm hiding in my headphones 
Hiding in my headphones
And everyone can see 
That they wont bother me

So get, out of, my way
Cuz I don't care what you have to say
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

This finger's for you 
This finger's for you
They flashin them lights and blow your horns too
This finger's for you 
This finger's for you
When you should be out runnin on just what you can do
So this is for the guys, for the girls, all the sexy chicks
[?]

Tempo is the beating bass at my feet
Boundin like a drum across the concrete
People in the city look so intense
I can see them talking but they make no sense
And I hear the bustle fighting your scene
Hiding in my headphones where you find me
Hey mister I don't mean to insult 
But to make small talk would be difficult
So I turn up the volume take a journey
Hiding in my headphones thats where I'll be
No wanna hear the beepin of the sassy horn
No wanna hear no buster playin saxaphone
No wanna hear no fella holding out the paper
Not even wanna hear a hello from me neighbor

Just dancing to the beat in my head, in my head
Just dancing to the beat in my head
Just dancing to the beat in my head, in my head
Just dancing to the beat in my head

I'm hiding in my headphones
Hiding in my headphones
Gunna turn them up so loud
Gunna drown this whole world out
I'm hiding in my headphones 
Hiding in my headphones
And everyone can see 
That they wont bother me
So get, out of, my way
Cuz I don't care what you have to say

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Woooooooo
Yeah
Wooooooo
Yeah

(this finger's for you)
(this finger's for you)
(they flashin them lights and blow your horns too)
(this finger's for you) 
(this finger's for you)
(when you should be out runnin on just what you can do)

If your lookin for trouble
You will get it on the double
You don't know who your dealing with, 
I'm a rough boy from out of the town

Dancing to the beat in my head, in my head
Just dancing to the beat in my head
Dancing to the beat in my head, in my head
Just dancing to the beat in my head
Dancing to the beat in my head, in my head
Just dancing to the beat in my head
