Keep a cool head
(Don't get excited)
Keep a cool head
(If you are ?)
Keep a cool head
(Don't get excited)

For in the darkness and countryside
There is no place you can hide, no sir
Do not get hysterical
Can you work a miracle?
(Cool head)
Use your anger wisely

Realise that ?? have to concentrate
Do not try and bump the spirit away, no sir
Do not get hysterical
Can you work a miracle?

Use your anger wisely
There's no bigger ?
