i just made an enemy of someone i don't know
and they are upset about somethin' that i
must have done. it really doesn't make much
sense well i've got no statement in my defense
i know, no matter what, no matter who, no
matter what i do, somebody hates me and i
hate somebody too.
did you misunderstand
something that i did or was there one of my
jokes that you didn't get or do you think
you've got
the way i think all figured out.
what did i say, to make you feel i'm not cool
now?
i know, no matter what no matter who no
matter what i do, somebody hates me, and i
hate somebody too. i know its wrong, but i do
it to and i guess i should say, don't let it get
to you. i know, no matter what no matter who
no matter what i do somebody hates me and i
hate somebody too somebody like you.
