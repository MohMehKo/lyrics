Nothin' on the radio again
I pick up my guitar
I put it right back down
I don't know why I even try

And I can't think of anything to say
But then I never thought I'd write another song again
But here it is

I'm not gonna make it
I don't think I can take it
So I'm gonna quit while I'm ahead

Well it's been happenin' to me all my life
Well I swore I'd never make the same mistakes
But now I'm making different ones

And I can't seem to ever get things right
Well it just feels like I'm goin round in circles
And I'm goin round in circles
And I

I'm not gonna make it
I don't think I can take it
So I'm gonna quit while I'm ahead

And I'm not gonna make it
I don't think I can take it
So I'm gonna quit while I'm ahead

But it's too late
It's too late
I'm a whole body now

And it's too late
It's too late
I'm a whole body now

Well, I'm not gonna make it
I don't think I can take it
So I'm gonna quit while I'm ahead

And I said
I'm not gonna make it
I don't think I can take it
So I'm gonna quit while I'm ahead

But it's too late
It's too late
I'm a whole body now

And it's too late
It's too late
I'm a whole body now
