Now that Im a big star, what am I gonna do?
I'm so bored counting all my money, I sit here
and I think of you. It's so easy, its so easy to do.
I don't even have to try, I don't even want to try,
Why should I waste my precious time?
I cant make you love me... but I know you
will. I'm such an asshole, how could you resist?
I never meant to let it go to my head, I
never thought it would come to this.
its me... the asshole of your dreams.
I can't make you love me... but I know you do.
I'm so cool, no one wants to talk to me
and I'm so cool, no one wants to look at me.
I'm so fuckin' cool, nobody  cares at all!
IM A BIG FUCKIN STAR OH YEA YEA YEA!
