Say I've got to save my soul
You know I wont let you go now
No no I wont let you go now
You know I wont let you go now
No no I wont let you go now

Some of them say they gettin ready
Some of them are rocking steady
Some of them are doing reggae
Some of them are doing nothing

I want you to rock it with I
I want you to rock it with I
I want you to rock it with I
I want you to rock it with I

Some of them become a christian
Some of them are politicians
Some of them are dread locked rastaas
Some of them are bowling monsters

I want you to rock it with I
I want you to rock it with I
I want you to rock it with I
I want you to rock it with I

Say I've got to save my soul
You know I wont let you go now
No no I wont let you go now
You know I wont let you go now
No no I wont let you go now

I want you to rock it with I (til end)
