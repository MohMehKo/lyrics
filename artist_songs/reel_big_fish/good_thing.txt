I never felt too good but in this world who would
I was always thinkin’ somethin’ wasn't right 
But then you came along and helped me sing a song and 
now I feel ok I hope it can stay- this way 

You know we've got a good thing goin' and I don't wanna see it end
You know we've got a good thing goin' and I don't wanna see it end 
Are these the good days that I've heard so much about-
there goes the heartbreak that I can live without 
I've been so frustrated, bitter, mean, and jaded
I've taken for granted all the things I've got
But now that you are here this anger disappears
and I feel happy too this is sappy but it's true 

You know we've got a good thing goin' and I don't wanna see it end
You know we've got a good thing goin' and I don't wanna see it end 
Are these the good days that I've heard so much about there goes the heartbreak 
that I can live without
