You called me up last night in tears and said you missed me after all these years
Well I’ve been waiting here so long, I’ve gotten over it since you've been gone 
You called me late last night again and said you're finished with your new boyfriend 
Asked if you could come back home- so sorry that you left me all alone 

You say you love me, love me again but if you love me- where have you been? 
You say you need me more than anyone else well go to hell, where have you been? 
You showed up at my door today and said my friend why do you push me away 
Your life with him was just so dull but what we had was something wonderful

You say you love me, you love me again but if you love me- where have you been? 
You say you need me more than anyone else well go to hell- where have you been? 
No way! You wish! I don't need this! What makes you think I’d ever want you again? 
Yeah right! As if! I don't need this What makes you think I'd ever want you again?
