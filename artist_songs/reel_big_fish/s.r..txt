What ever happened to suburban rhythm?
Why did Ed and Scott quit?
Please don’t go, Suburban Rhythm!
All the other bands are just shit!

A real big fish en de la mer because
I start a record company that’s gonna repair
They mess up all the lyrics and they got no style
I say, “They’re gonna get it right, but it might take a while”
(Do Wah!)

Don’t touch that dial
I’ve never been told if we’re that good
And I said I’d never, never play with a ska band again
I guess I never showed up

What ever happened to suburban rhythm?
Why did Ed and Scott quit?
(Would you please drop some bass and shit?)
Please don’t go, Suburban Rhythm
All the other bands are just shit
(You said it!)
