Hey, hey everybody! Look who's on TV, look who just got famous
don't you know it should have been me...
I'm not really bitter, I'm not really mad, I love to see other people
get everything I ever wanted to have,
I don't really care, how big they get... I hate you, fuck you
leave me alone! Why cant I be cool like them?
I used to have a girlfriend, I treated her so bad, she went out and
found another lead singer, maybe she just likes guys in bands.
I give up on everything, all my dreams are dead, maybe I'll get a
shotgun, and try to blow her right out of my head... everybody says,
"How come you ain't made it yet?" I hate you, fuck you, leave me
alone! Why can't I get my girl back?
I knew you wouldn't understand, just what I'm tryin' to do, cause you're
not me, and I'm so glad that I am not you...
I know it's my problem, there's nothing I can do, but I don't think
there is no reason, I don't think there's no excuse for you...
well I've learned my lesson, hope you've learned it to, and if
they're gonna go and do it to me well I guess I'm gonna have to
go and do it to you... I don't really care, how much you cry...
IhateyoufuckyouleavemealoneIhateyoufuckyouleavemealone!!!
why can't anything go my way?
