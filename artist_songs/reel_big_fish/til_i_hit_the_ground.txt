Sky is falling
It's alright, it's alright
I'll be fine
Now I'm falling
It's alright, it's alright
Gonna look like I'm flying

We'll they're screaming at my windows
They've got axes in their hands
They're chopping down the back door
Of my wonderin' promise land
They're begging me to save the world
They're dealing at my feet
And I'll tell em' that the anti-Christ
Lives just across the street

Sky is falling
It's alright, it's alright
I'll be fine
Now I'm falling
It's alright, it's alright
Gonna look like I'm flying

Oh my heart it is an open sword
It never seemed to dry
And a thousand words
Just got me bloody fingers
And I wish that I could cry
And she only stopped that laughing
Long enough to dry a tear
I wish that I was some place else
But I found I'm always here

Sky is falling
It's alright, it's alright
I'll be fine
Now I'm falling
It's alright, it's alright
Gonna look like I'm flying

Sky is falling
It's alright, it's alright
I'll be fine
Now I'm falling
It's alright, it's alright
Gonna look like I'm flying

Well I've got no time to argue
And I got no time to spare
The world is burning down at night
And she don't really care
I would give her everything
But I tell you it's a shame
Cause' she is all I think about
And I just forgot her name
