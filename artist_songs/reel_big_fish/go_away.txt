She was never what I wanted,
I just wanted someone else.
Now Im sittin' here alone, I'm
sittin' here all by myself
and everybody loves me
and they want me to be their boyfriend
She's the only one for me,
I don't want to see her again... why cant she just go away?
I cant get her out of my brain.
Why cant she just go away? I'd only want her to stay.
Why cant she just go away? GO AWAY.
