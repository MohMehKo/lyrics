There’s a steel train coming through, I would take it if I could
And I would not lie to you, cause Sunday morning soon will come when
Things will be much easier to say, upon the microphone like a Boss DJ
But I’m wont walk upon the sea like it was dry land
The Boss DJ ain’t nothing but a man
No trouble, No fuss- I know why
It’s so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice
It’s so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice
Rumors are spreadin’ all over my town but it’s like stones and sticks
cuz on the microphone is where I get my fix
just let the lovin’ take ahold cuz it will if you let it
I’m funky not a junkie but I know where to get it
No trouble, no fuss- I know why 
It’s so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice
It’s so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice
Oowee girl oowee girl oowee girl
There really ain’t no time to waste, really ain’t no time to hate
Ain’t got no time to waste, time to hate
Really ain’t no time to let the time go waste
So mister DJ don’t stop the music, I wanna know
Are you feelin the same way too?
I wanna rock it with you girl ooh girl
Don’t stop cuz
It’s so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice
It’s so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice
Nowadays the songs on the radio all drive me crazy
