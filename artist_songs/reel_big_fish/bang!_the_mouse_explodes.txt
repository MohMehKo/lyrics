Uh-oh, they know around the world
Whoa-oh, the secret is unfurled
And now, they know around the world 
Uh-oh

We know, we saw the print-out say
We know, they tried to make us stay
And now, we won't go away
Uh-oh

And they told us
That they sold us
But we brought them down!

[Chorus]
Bang! The mouse explodes!
Bang! The mouse explodes!
Bang! Bang! The mouse explodes!
Tonight
All right
It's out of sight

Uh-oh, they know the pressure's on
Uh-oh, they want to see us bond
They'd love for us to get it wrong
Uh-oh

But they didn't hold too deep
To get out out now

[Chorus x2]
