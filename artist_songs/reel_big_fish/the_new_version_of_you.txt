When did you quit pulling all of the stops for me
And when did your one hundred and ten per-cent
Become under fifty
There you are phoning it in
Going through the motions with an artificial grin
You say that you're getting better
You say that you're getting better

You say you're becoming a better person
One that isn't so lame
You say you're becoming a better person
But I still feel the same

It's the new, it's the new, new version of you
It's the new, it's the new, new version of you
It's the new, it's the new, new version of you
If there's one thing I'd like to do
It's kill the new version of you

When did you start wearing all of those clothes to be cool
And when did you start using all that slang?
I can't understand you
I bet you'd forget to say "I love you"
If the teleprompter hadn't told you
You say that you're getting better
You say that you're getting better

You say you're becoming a better person
One that isn't so lame
You say you're becoming a better person
But I still feel the same

It's the new, it's the new, new version of you
It's the new, it's the new, new version of you
It's the new, it's the new, new version of you
If there's one thing I'd like to do
It's kill the new version of you

Who are you?
I don't know now
You got me wondering I wonder
How you got to be so different now

You say you're becoming a better person
One that isn't so lame
You say you're becoming a better person
But I still feel the same
I still feel the same

It's the new, it's the new, new version of you
It's the new, it's the new, new version of you
It's the new, it's the new, new version of you
If there's one thing I'd like to do
It's kill the new version of you
