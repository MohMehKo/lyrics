Going back to the way
Going back to the way
That it used to be
When things were much better
Going back to the way
Going back to the way
That it used to be
When we were together

It's been so hard for me
To take all the things that come my way
It's been so hard but know I say
We are

Going back to the way
Going back to the way
That it used to be
When things were much better
Going back to the way
Going back to the way
That it used to be
When we were together

I've been alone too long
There's no one else
I'd rather see
Nothing's more right
Than you and me
So we're

Going back to the way
Going back to the way
That it used to be
When things were much better
Going back to the way
Going back to the way
That it used to be
When we were together

Going back to the way
Going back to the way
That it used to be
When things were much better
Going back to the way
Going back to the way
That it used to be
When we were together
