I've got big dreams but no self-esteem, you know? 
I'd reach for the stars but I can't find my arms 
All this time we've accomplished so much 
Why can't I believe why can't I just feel love?

Goin' away leavin’ today you've gotta find a brand new hero 
I let you down when you're not around you know I can't be trusted with anything 
All this time we've wanted so much to just belong why can't we just feel love? 
Goin’ away leavin today you've gotta find a brand new hero 
What will they say when I've gone away? Gotta find a brand new hero
