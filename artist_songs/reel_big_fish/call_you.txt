Got the telephone in my hand, gonna call you up tonight.
Planned every word I'll say, I'm gonna do it right.
Maybe I'll wait a little longer, maybe I'm not ready yet.
Where did I put that number? How could I ever, ever forget?
I try but I hang up, every time, to call you girl and make you mine
If you pick it up I'll have it made, I'm gonna call you now,
I wont be afraid
Got the telephone in my hand, cord around my neck.
But I'm not really ready to die, maybe I'll give it one more try
or maybe I'll call tomorrow, she probably wont be home, maybe I like
sitting here, maybe I like being all alone...
Everything will be all right, I won't see you tonight, everything
will be all right, I know it's not the end of the world, it's just
another... little girl.
I try but I hang up every time, to call you girl and make you mine
can't leave a message, don't know what to say, I don't wanna
talk to you anyway.
