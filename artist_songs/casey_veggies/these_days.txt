[Hook:]
You know I'll always give you my heart
Till it can't beat
And we gonn let these days go by
Do everything that I think
Send better thoughts to me
And we gonn let these days go by
Even though we get signs
That it ain't the right time
We gonn let these days go by
Something bout the design
How it can take what I love
But we gonn let these days go by

[Verse 1:]
As long as my fam straight
Everything feel ok
My favorite rapper Kanye, she told me her's the same thing
Now you doin your thing, case in the sit you drop this bombay
You got a chance to be the next star
As a testament that life change
Writing on my life seems, got me attention like the ice brings
Creepin on them tight jeans, ain't trippin on gas prices
When you gonn invite me? I got a whip, you got a jacuzzi
That's enough spoony, show me what you gonn do to me
Don't know what to do with my damn self
So I can't tell you where you should be
Rockin all this jewlery, minorities say it's foolery
My gold chain and my gold ring, earrings a few k
4 ring on my 2 door, like what I wear if I'm 2 4
Letting go of the old shit, on the better things should do more
Like flying out to Singapore, writin poetry by the sea shore
Young Veggies, fonz ready
Young veggies, I say it again
Make more, we lay low, like where ahead did the days go?

[Hook:]
You know I'll always give you my heart
Till it can't beat
And we gonn let these days go by
Do everything that I think
Send better thoughts to me
And we gonn let these days go by
Even though we get signs
That it ain't the right time
We gonn let these days go by
Something bout the design
How it can take what I love
But we gonn let these days go by

[Verse 2:]
I know it's hard not to let life's pleasure distract you
Believe some of what you hear, cause that's what it's factual
This is me, got the second mixtape tattooed
On my leg, cause I stand for every word I said
She bad and she fly, she got turbulence
That mean we go to war with no alternatives
I see it in and out and I ain't even learned of it
I did no book research and a presentation, aced the shit
The fans choosin up cause this shit's straight legit
Like when you find a girl then start finding out her favorite things
Then you realize we got something, this can be a team
Then you move on of doing good and doing wrong
This type a part ain't doing me no type of favors
Why am I letting this do to me, I'll see you later
This life's a blessin, no stressin
No assault what it's meant to be
I can be somewhere homeless,
Overcomin the injuries
I can be where the home is
Where we really is from
Where the black children hungry and the water don't come
And our money is scarce so the planes don't fly
And they don't make it to the us
Where they prolly choose fly
I never thought that one day I would look in your eyes
And see, everything that I really need in my life
Remember walking in, with my G mind die
Client sneaking in, she could have just stayed alive
For one more moment so, I can just come say hi
Leona Smith, that's my angel girl, you saved my life
Get it, got it good, baby girl you changed my life
Showed me the qualities that I thought was right

[Hook:]
You know I'll always give you my heart
Till it can't beat
And we gonn let these days go by
Do everything that I think
Send better thoughts to me
And we gonn let these days go by
Even though we get signs
That it ain't the right time
We gonn let these days go by
Something bout the design
How it can take what I love
But we gonn let these days go by
