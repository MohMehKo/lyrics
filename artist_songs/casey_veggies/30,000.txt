My nigga I'm awesome
Everything crisp white flossin
I don't do this often
Right now I'mÂ  [?]
Swag, swag, sold, man, I shoulda sold it at an auction
Niggas still steal it as I'm walking
Feelin like the next nigga here,
I don't care, I'm a get it
Cus the way I spit this shit, so specific,
Couple thousand in my pocket,
Make sure them girls with it, cus I swear they ain't dealin with no ordinary niggas
Right now, I got my whole city poppin, a bunch of options
They messin with them labels tryin to stop shit, I got this
Give me my kudos now,
My old chick so mad at my new hoes now (swag)
Got them girls eatin veggies in the produce aisle (swag)
Ended up one time, now I know you a while (swag)
But I don't know you now, I saw everything I needed
Let me show you how
