[Intro:]
What's your story?
Where did you come from?
Where you get that from? You know what I'm sayin?
Yea
Yea
Young winners, big dreams
Let's go

[Verse 1:]
I'm poppin, we on
She playin my songs
I prefer to just get the dome
Or the backside 'cause I like medicine
Real young boy with a king intuition
More like a nigga in prison
French fries send to my chrissy
Ride through the city with a sassy young thing and she part of the committee
Girl let's get down to the itty gritty
If you ain't wanna flirt then cover your titties
Says she wanna fuck, want someone like Diddy
Ain't making a band, just made a hundred grand
Young winners we got it, man you born not needy just like me
Baby so cold, baby so cold
Baby wanna teller so to tell er let's roll
To a place where we know we can go
Remember when they didn't even know we can flow?
I'm the freshest young kid, most popular
Catch me in the city, I'm poppin up
Ain't no such thing as a pop of blow
'Cause you still gon forget what you used to know
I'm putting on, I'm openin doors
I'm loving my high, touchin my lows
Girl where you wanna get dropped off?
We can drive this time with the top off
How bout this time I get topped off?
Excuse my language, that's just Spanglish
We just had a boy talk 'cause he famous
Getting two out, gotta tame it
So I stay in sight, I should frame it
Just to let you know, we ain't on the same shit

[Hook:]
I'm poppin, we on
She playin my songs
I'm rightin my wrongs
It took me so long
I came a far way and I did everything my way
That's progress, my options
That took time to process
Young winners, we got it
Young winners, we got it
Man, young winners, we got it
Young winners, we got it
Man, young winners, we got it, wut
Young winners, we got it
Man, young winners, we got it
Young winners, we got it, man

[Verse 2:]
If you don't compromise then you gon strike
Are you ride or die? Please don't lie
See on to the next with it, didn't realize that she had the best with her
S on my chest, I'm Superman
Flying through the hood, told the homey what's good
Though you need a lil bit of inspiration
So I told myself I might as well should
Said I might as well should
Yea, I might as well should
I'm that dude, I wear my heart like a tattoo, my life is up
My nights is long and my lights are strong
Gotta lift litter to write this song
Gotta focus to be what I'm on
Gotta boost men like birthday cologne
Young winners, we got it
Shaded it off in the topics
Talk to the people like a prophet
All my youngins ain't misguided
Make so you the flyest
And work on your comment
Don't be mad you ain't shinin, you can spin that tomgunnin
Ask about him in the streets they gon say a beast
Catch her right place, right time, she gon freak
We squaded up like we gon eat
Kept the same thought like you gon see
She yelling out that so CV
With a lot more money than my last CD
Lot of people thought that they had me beat
Til they turned this on like a MP3 like

[Hook:]
I'm poppin, we on
She playin my songs
I'm rightin my wrongs
It took me so long
I came a far way and I did everything my way
That's progress, my options
That took time to process
Young winners, we got it
Young winners, we got it
Man, young winners, we got it
Young winners, we got it
Man, young winners, we got it, wut
Young winners, we got it
Man, young winners, we got it
Young winners, we got it, man
