Is that young nigger, that
Always speak the m life rhymes
Always slept with the right dreams

Made you give me them [?] dreams
[?] don't you think that I dream
[?] I feel fine, only fuck with bright queens!
I didn't made up my mind if you focus on right things
It realize that it would take time
You will have a great time, everything go [?]
That's what they told me [?] they had to show me
Plus I already know it, let's get this money!

Might run to the whole crew.

The concentration this shit is basic
And niggers hating is the same reason we ain't fading!
Could have lift the nation
I know girls, that's liberation, can't [?] be patient and she need her friend approval just for her to mess with [?]
He a rapid girl, that nigger crazy
But you contradict [?] down a nigger kicking
Talking about this [?] I came in and [?]
[?] man, that's some great arrangements.
I wouldn't call me famous
Just a kid that's gonna change shit
When I walk in this world, I thought I ought to make it!

Please don't worry, you know I got some plans
When that school bell ring my next [?] start up

Girls complex, I don't even judge up
Tell me who is next, when the best grind is [?] us

Might run to the whole crew.

The lifestyle of the young and wild
I don't cross [?] in my life,
You're trying to tell me something now!
But I'm rocking, no stopping, my bench [?]
My ex girl never got me, my dream car, Bugatti
But I settle a Ferrari, my camera is a paparazzi
My checks read vengeance, my dad read a [?]
The way I love her like [?]
Cause it's one thing, I really think [?] stay with me
[?] did she make me a young believer
Cause day is beautiful, day respect us [?]
I told my momma, I'm a take her where palm trees at
And buy a house with dish washes and [?]
[?] no time to do chores, three months on my [?]
Stacking dollars for sure [?] to move forward.
I think that that's what life's about
Trying to figure it out
Find a new [?] and hold that [?]
