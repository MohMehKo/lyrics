[Intro:]
Take take my life
Oh give my love babe
Gonna take take take my life
Oh, give me my love babe

[Hook:]
They can take my life, take my heights,
Take the name for what is worth,
Just so I can have what I need,
To reside on this earth
Take the goal, take the shows,
Take the money and the foreign clothes
As I finish this sentence, I can feel this in my soul.

[Verse 1:]
Hallelujah I made it confusions and alternators abusing
My love for music, I can do it, I'm taking it to the play stack,
Ex wood with black people dress good
And all colors love each other and my girl sex good,
She makes sure I wear a rubber, partially scared of lovin
She often been tearing up, things get so mysterious
It's hard to sign the right deal when all of these labels want it
It's hard to find which one real,
When all of these girls love us,
Uh, I let you do your thing 'cause you so head strong
Bread long my mind gone, on the flight through different time zone,
I'm right here 'cause my grind strong,
Give you more like some Styrofoam
Wasn't on the shit that I was on,
When you was 13 I was rehearsing and flirting with my dreams,
Then we started dating,
Wasn't right I stay patient,
Now we in paradise, like paradise,
My life is insane, Siroc and champagne
Cutting off my last hopes and giving you my last name,
Getting on my fine sway, we just wanna party,
She just move her body to everyone look her way,
I want it all, is my living D so front that or I'm coming back
She got the type of ass I have fun with that, had to run it back.

[Hook: x2]
They can take my life, take my heights,
Take the name for what is worth,
Just so I can have what I need,
To reside on this earth
Take the goal, take the shows,
Take the money and the foreign clothes
As I finish this sentence, I can feel this in my soul.

[Verse 2:]
On the west side, with the top down,
Payin homage but my pack now,
Had a lot of promise now I stay down
If you stay working then you can make purpose,
They all gonna take me lies like Casey no I won't hurt you,
I had to shade up and rearrange the whole surface,
This is my soul purpose, maybe I'm just so certain,
Independent on no person, oh man, yeah
Staying humble but I'm up now,
Put those legs up, girl don't let me down
So affectionate, so affect me now
It's evident that I'm ready now,
Word, by the time I got to think about my old dough
I was on to the next getting more dough,
Caressing the vibe, flexin the thighs,
That sort of time and I'm enjoying no ride,
Don't know my life, doing what's right,
The minaties, my nigga agrees it's December,
I'm on summer shit,
Hot boy but I'm so cold,
The next up that's not you,
Don't rush impatient, we need to take our time,
Take your time patience rush,
She was in a rush, so I told you baby take your time
'Cause I know we can live it up,
Let me know what's up?

[Hook: x2]
They can take my life, take my heights,
Take the name for what is worth,
Just so I can have what I need,
To reside on this earth
Take the goal, take the shows,
Take the money and the foreign clothes
As I finish this sentence, I can feel this in my soul.
