[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Mind racing, steady chasing, what yo life like?
Riding in that new shit your probably try to side swipe
From the city where they call the phase on sight
Pull me over got my rights, got some girls for the night
Real niggas for life, get your grip, run that strip
All you present don't know now shit, get focus man
Mama from the ghetto, so she know how to settle
Told her when I get on that something that she gonna have to lego
Looking in the mirror like Casey {what should you write?}
Look her right up in the eyes like you should prolly spend the night
Her legs and chest, manifest my little stress
Young boss kiddo, please don't mess with no middle man

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Sky so blue, ride so green, money run everything and I learned that for Free
They call me young C might pull up in a V
You could go out and get it if you knew what you could be
Flip that O, get that dope, it's a mental plan and them niggas making grands, everybody waving hands
Everybody waving hands, say everybody waving hands

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
So inspiring, like love that expired
And them drugs they acquired to fulfill certain desires
I'm rolling till the tires off, hoping I can fight it off
Scoping through an opening, trying to take it to a better spot
I'm something like, when you come from nothing with that hustling
My chick bad, ass look like muffins out the oven
Girl, better show me something, it ain't nothing, no discussion
And if she did it, for really, I'm still gonn hit it
Eventually, all we need, good vibes and energy
She trying to rule, but I don't give her an inch of me
Peace and carrots get money the green infantry
Rose on the beat and I rose in beneath...

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Sky so blue, ride so green, money run everything and I learned that for Free
They call me young C might pull up in a V
You would go out and get it if you knew what you could be
Flip that O, get that dope, it's a mental plan and them niggas making grands, everybody waving hands
Everybody waving hands, say everybody waving hands
Everybody waving hands, say everybody waving hands

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
You see them girls watching, everything popping
Told that chick sit back, look at all my dreams prosper
Way she act like she going... win an Oscar
I should win an Emmy every episode I'm swimming
Wassup, how you doing? Wave your hands for this boy
That's on some new shit, swag so intrusive
Jab so abusive, dream so illusive

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Sky so blue, ride so green, money run everything and I learned that for Free
They call me young C might pull up in a V
You would go out and get it if you knew what you could be
Flip that O, get that dope, it's a mental plan and them niggas making grands, everybody waving hands
Everybody waving hands, say everybody waving hands
Everybody waving hands, say everybody waving hands
