Aw man
Damn
Right back at 'em
Way better
Volume 3

[Verse 1:]
Way more smarter than my last tape
I get way more harder when that ass shake
With my shit in that
I get in that
With the thought in my head like I hope it lasts
Real young boy that's making cash
I'm realizing I can make a stack
For a rainy day when they coming back
We young niggas
We fresh swag
Got the whole world in the bag
Roof in the grass now the speakers on blast
Whole shit made it to the news stands
I grind hard in these new jeans
I never ever stop where the weather really hot
Where the homie ran the streets and that's why he got shot
Used to bang on my nigga
That's life on the block
That's peer pressure for your ass
Girl, tell me how I can destroy your past
You growing up, didn't know no better
And I'm blowing up, my show got better
You create some shine you know what's next up
Streets start talking, name getting brought up
Hop on now cause the train ain't stopping
Used to try my hardest
Still wanna be an artist
Never was a rapper didn't wanna be trapped in
At school, no work, just a black pen
Composition pad where the kid wrote raps in
That's where I got sleeping in class
Never really dozed off but we dream so fast
Leave my past and stay in my dome
At the hotel I just stay in my room
Stuck in my zone
Answer my phone
Say I'm a catch my flight and I'm coming back home

[Chorus:]
Please don't let me go
I just wanna know
Told you not to leave
And I promise we will grow
Life is like a garden
Don't end where you started
Remind me of that feeling
When I wake up in the morning

[Verse 2:]
Take you out to eat
Bring out the freak
Can't tell you everything it's about to be
She know a young nigga stunting
Only dumb niggas fronting
Never run from the money
Give you a run for your money
Customized Greatly
Same young Casey
For a number pen
I'm about to cop everything
Enjoy wins and the things that life brings
She go to school & church, that's wifey
Young Veggies, Young Veggies
It's Young what? I'll say it again
You'll fall in love if you gave me a chance
Trying to make me a man but I already am
Love of the game
Don't put trust in the fame
Full of wack ass lames throwing salt in your name
That was just to let you know
Watch what you get into
Cause these fucking streets ain't what they cracked up to be
Hate in my heart
Never been scared
Got another thing coming if you matching up with me
On my way to stardom
Never was about problems
So my cousin going to handle that ass for free
I shaded up and I got better
New whip
I dropped cheddar
That new joint
I'm going to met her
And I'm just ignoring my phone ringing like...

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Let it go then let me know
If you find out what your mind about
Ain't nothing better than a brand new mindset
Plus a rolex and spot to spend time at
Buying that if you figure where your grind at
I speak about it a lot because I'm about that
In the back of the check she wasn't out here
Boy, I need your respect? I swear we don't care
Real come at your neck to get the whole spread
Break it down and inspect to get it whole sale
Got cash in my pocket at the hotel
Having fun living life like oh well
She got the arc in the back
So I know it ain't flat
Girl show me where it's at
So I can go on and attack
She inspire me
High off life, man
The hit of that irony worth a whole lifespan
Real young black nigga from the hood
Getting money from the white man
And my girl light skin
Lot of rappers say all that good music doubting
Then my whole city been holding me down proudly
Might press CD's and I'm outie
Bottle of Moscato and me and my girl about it
Whole world yours
Learned that on Illmatic
Swear I been had it
Just had to grab it
I'm a sinner
And I know it
But God made me feel so heroic
Niggas be talking
Never even show it
Got something to say?
Feel free
I'm open
Roll with my music
Taught a lot of niggas how to move quick
Since I made up my mind I'm gonna do it back in '06
Shout out to my niggas that are no longer here
That don't mean them dudes died
They just no longer here
Got to learn to do it for yourself
And no longer fear
All the negative shit that people throw in your ear
If I'm a do it I'm a be great
Just tell me if you relate
You punchline ass rappers represent the shit that we hate
Cause everything I spit helped me cop new Prada
Got new flows and I got new money
Young'n on his shit
And my brother need a whip
And he had half of his
Here go $2200
Bro I got you

[Chorus]
