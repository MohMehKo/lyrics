Are you a friend or my enemy, most of these people pretend to be
Claiming and acting like can I be, wasn't celebrity would you be into me
So many hoes need like ten of me
Shorty so shallow she faking the chemistry
We do this so sick til infinity
Pouring up Hennessy, real nigga remedy
I did this shit on my own, I bought this whip with no loan
Took my mom from apartment to home
Bout to book her on flights at the Rome
Now we seeing new faces together, at times at the top you alone
We bout to get rich forever, I guess this shit come with the throne

[Hook:]
New faces, new faces, new faces
New faces, new faces, new faces
All I see is new faces
Book a trip now we major, counting up new faces
In my city getting paper
All I'm seeing new faces
New faces, new faces, new faces
New faces, new faces, new faces
All I see is new faces
Book a trip now we major, counting up new faces
In my city getting paper
All I'm seeing new faces

I just had an epiphany, you niggas didn't do shit for me
Now I'm seeing shit differently and I'm bout to make history
Seems everywhere that I go, these backstabbers try to get to me
The label wanna get a hit from me but I play the game like a symphony
Fuck you to my enemies, I ain't showing no sympathy
Fuckboys can't censor me, can't change my identity
Money and the fame ain't switching me
Came a long way from selling the beats
Pulling up in Rodeo out in Beverely
After party then we hit the hotel suite
All I'm seeing is...

[Hook:]
New faces, new faces, new faces
New faces, new faces, new faces
All I see is new faces
Book a trip now we major, counting up new faces
In my city getting paper
All I'm seeing new faces
New faces, new faces, new faces
New faces, new faces, new faces
All I see is new faces
Book a trip now we major, counting up new faces
In my city getting paper
All I'm seeing new faces

All I see is new faces, new foreign chick and she famous
She cash me out and we dating, baby call and make the reservation
Every day shit, ain't no celebration
I can show you just how life changes
She innocent and impatient, she want it right now, she hate waiting
Every day new places, every day on new stages
Everybody wanna be somebody but to be the boss you gotta feed somebody
My base car like diesel pilots
Straight to the league, I ain't need no college
Went from six man to balling hard like Harden
Another hundred bands, I don't need no wallet

[Hook:]
New faces, new faces, new faces
New faces, new faces, new faces
All I see is new faces
Book a trip now we major, counting up new faces
In my city getting paper
All I'm seeing new faces
New faces, new faces, new faces
New faces, new faces, new faces
All I see is new faces
Book a trip now we major, counting up new faces
In my city getting paper
All I'm seeing new faces
