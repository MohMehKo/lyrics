No boxes, we sure stop and this since the closest thing I go pop with
These drugs will have all the girls popping
Pop this, girl, after that, I have you topless
No contest, came in, straight on me
Next morning, see her laid in, like an omelet
Wake 'er up, have that girl give 'er some massages
Three girls, three homies, call that shit collaging
It's Young Veggies, 2012 on my thirty thousand
Girls wallet hurting, she rather she can drive up a mountain
Talking mountains, I'm never going down
Stay on top of my game, more chains and it's getting crowded

Everything fo' show, you already know
That we was about to blow, kept that on the low
She usually down today, she tryna draw
Excited cause she's with us toward Alaska
Stacking money, right now
Tell them niggas, quiet down
Stacking money, right now
Tell them niggas, quiet down
Verified niggas, everything official
Verified niggas, everything official

Oh man, the boy's in, let's get these ims way I got
On these tracks car never end
I'll be pulling money in, this time I won't spend
Might pull up on you in the Benz
A girl think she know me but I got enough friends
Thous eleven jays, bought all my chick's tens
My ex gon stay cause I need my revenge
Got these Gucci shades but I keep it rim on lends
Call that shit out so you know I'm gonna spin
Five hundred cash like Al Bundy
And I got all this shit to say
Why would I hold it in?
Even my freak, hoes and shit
These hoes I be over this
You know I'll be goin' in

Everything fo' show, you already know
That we was about to blow, kept that on the low
She usually down today, she tryna draw
Excited cause she's with us toward Alaska
Stacking money, right now
Tell them niggas, quiet down

I'm a young stunner, most y'all one under
Tell 'er she can choose, no, she don't wanna won this
Super soak a flows and I'm shining every summer
Stupid I suppose, chasing girls not money

Stacking money, right now
Tell them niggas, quiet down
