[Verse:]
If you love er you should tell er,
If you got it then set it,
Now we're poppin it on so we're rockin' I get it shot and I let it
I'm guapin and grownin and doing my thing, got moments in tears
Got a bad mix chick, got a bad mix chick, and I think we're getting married
I wanna name my son Mat... a million
She like Casey don't be worried bout it,
These rappers is all children
I'll prep you for the contract
Then I sign and sealed it,
I put er on the team and I got it on lock,
Permanent back and I won't even watch
Check em, check em get his respect up,
Get it be hangin' and I hope God bless em,
I'm just debating on sipping this thing what?
Dollars be making and chickens we're bangin'
Grinding hard and I'm staying up late,
Grinding hard and I'm staying up late,
You know we got the new clothing line
I can show you the catalogue,
Mad just be ballin' but I used to play basketball,
Coach ain't put me in the game so I had to make a way
If you see it with the fade away in LA and the temperature 88
I'm getting paid today, fuck that let's have sex swerve
I may give it to you straight swag,
Give it to your girlfriend then and then I break fast,
She ain't' never had a winner that made cash
And is something that I happen maybe just that
I ain't no hollaback, nigga looking for some acknowledgements
Like the chick that go to college man,
Messing me might get her scholarship

[Hook: x2]
Hopped in my new car, spending all my old dough
My girl a movie star, she just play her role though
Came off the block, coming out on top,
I put er on the team and I got it on lock,
Turn my back and I won't even watch.

[Bridge:]
TGM and slow, droppin' man no slows,
Get the tale my lot of shit, but hell not I ain't' grow
Niggas losin' hope, shouldn't even be crying,
If you say so fuckin with that G so I guess she on a diet,
Yeah we're poppin that moe, yeah my nigga G 4,
Getting to you slow, be good or be go
Jamaican food in the shard
I can tell it goes hard,
Baby girl be flexin, but I can tell she on it,

[Hook: x2]
Hopped in my new car, spending all my old dough
My girl a movie star, she just play her role though
Came off the block, coming out on top,
I put er on the team and I got it on lock,
Turn my back and I won't even watch.

[Outro:]
Yea
Oh man
You already know what it is
Can't see ouchea
Tell it like this
It's 20-13 and we put you on the team
You know what I'm saying?
You can get in the starting lineup and all that
