[Verse 1:]
Pulled up stuntin and everything wavy
Whip half a hunned jeans cost 580
I can tell she want it cause she acting so complacing
You can say I'm wrong well I guess the boy crazy
Runnin, runnin, runnin man that's all a nigga sayin
Hunneds, hunneds, hunneds man that's all I'm really payin
Lifestyle flows yeah that's all I'm really sprayin
She call me on the weekend and we head straight to the deep in
Wheepin, ball so hard from the mornin to the evenin
And I make her do the cleanin and I make the girl sleep it
Turn me up, one time, I ain't got no punch lines
Lil mama so fine, I had to give her that punch lines
Like wait, hold up, all I do is show up
She sweet like a fruit roll up
So all I do is dough up
Like wait, hold up they let the boy get his dough up
My girl watch me grow up
Right before her eyes I blow up
They came through makin that noise
Back that boy winnin for sure
Gettin money on tour, I might bring back Valur
Suicide my doors, I'm fylin out, you tryin out
Got diamonds in designer, but gonn find out what my mind about

[Hook: x2]
Pulled up stuntin and everything wavy
Whip half a hunned jeans cost 580
Girls in the crowd and they all screamin Casey
You know you my baby
You knew I would make it

[Verse 2:]
Amazes, like where the days went
In amazin, I'm chasin, stupid comments
It ain't no stopping us, period, she so furious
Cause I dropped her, I'm menace hoe
Plus some motto, more niggas is watchin
I got this, you can get knocked off
With the lights out, and the top off
On the block with the Rottweilers
On board so cold but I'm not soft, oh
I'm poppin out, she's a player so I knocked her down
All the way to the ground and after that
She ain't make a sound like wait, hold up
Tell somebody to roll up,
I'm from killer cali where all we do is dough up
Like wait, hold up, baby girls come over
All we do is get odor, so let's get it in for a sober
When I swerve up she get piped down
Get paid off my lifestyle
All the real niggas say hey, all the bad girls say aw
Every day is payday and every night I get wiped down
Everything been crazy, and I pulled up and it's wavy

[Hook: x2]
Pulled up stuntin and everything wavy
Whip half a hunned jeans cost 580
Girls in the crowd and they all screamin Casey
You know you my baby
You knew I would make it
