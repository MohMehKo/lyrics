[Chorus:]
I love me some you (say that one more time)
I love me some you (I love me some you)
I love me some you (I love me some you)
I love me some you (I love me some you)

[Verse 1:]
I love me some you, I be ridin coupes
I'll be livin my life, so you ride through
I just keep around, I need something too
Is she really rockin', guess I never knew,
Or I'll never know, till we live and grow,
Try to turn my chain, but if you see me through,
She say I'm a rebel, I'm just on my level
You deserve a medal, I just want you to feel special,
I love me some you, this ain't nothing new
Guess I soon work, I know we be cool,
I don't never talk, she don't never tell,
I don't never listen, she don't ever hear.

[Chorus:]
I love me some you (say that one more time)
I love me some you (I love me some you)
I love me some you (I love me some you)
I love me some you (I love me some you)

[Verse 2:]
I love me some you, but trust at least a few
If I would go to school, I can be with you,
You know I've been playing, I like joking too,
How bout getting gold, I'll always let it show,
Sometimes she try too hard, I should just let it go,
You wanna go for war, just let me open up,
My thought be bottled in, I need to cough it up,
Pandimania girl, put your eyes to the world,
Yeah you're so precious, I shouldn't be so reckless,
When dealing with your heart, so handle that we care,
Ain't like them regular ballers, girl I'm doing something new,
They always got something to say, we ain't doing you.

[Chorus:]
I love me some you (say that one more time)
I love me some you (I love me some you)
I love me some you (I love me some you)
I love me some you (I love me some you)

[Bridge:]
What I tell you shouldn't make it different
You should respect the fact that I made a livin' yeah
What I tell you shouldn't make it different
In the first place I already made you feel me.

[Verse 3:]
Yeah, I love me some you, just keep me in the lute,
Even if it hurtin' just tell me the truth,
Have to take apart just like an interlude,
Then get you in the new, this what I dream to do,
Yeah you're so precious and now they know actions
I like your whole text, just a young boy, my fam from Texas,
But we could go when we get old,
And our kids can know, I love me some you

[Chorus:]
I love me some you (say that one more time)
I love me some you (I love me some you)
I love me some you (I love me some you)
I love me some you (I love me some you)

[Bridge:]
What I tell you shouldn't make it different
You should respect the fact that I made a livin' yeah
What I tell you shouldn't make it different
In the first place I already made you feel me.

[Outro:]
Yeah, yeah
Ladies and gentlemen
It's so special, so special.
I love me some you
I love me, I love me some you
I love me some you, I love me some you...
