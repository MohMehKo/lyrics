Hoes go crazy, yeah
Hey, what's your name, lil homie
Yeah, I'm talking to you
Yeah, yeah

What's your name little mama, what's wavy
Twenty years old, got no babies
Like CG3, hoes go crazy
Got the Audi man now I want to cop the 'cedes
Or the Maserati always keep a chick with body
Blowing up, they gon' think it's illuminati
Growing up, never got a slow day
This world wrong, we just let it rotate
When I'm grindin' my baby be missing me
She a cute chick, different ethnicities
Pull up to the function with a slow creep
Leave with a girl that's popping, keep it lowkey
Well respected in the city, niggas know me
And they go hard for me cause they owe me
Peas and Carrots store off Beverley
Praise God that we living heavenly

[Hook:]
They see us when we ball, we be acting up
Getting calls from your broad, we be acting up
Pull up coop to the mall, see me acting up
Back in the morning, I'm acting up
Hoes see us when we ball, yeah we acting up
If she say we fell in love, she be acting up
And my city sold out, acting up
They don't do it like us, we be acting up

[Dom Kennedy:]
If she take two sips, she gon' need a fifth
Can't do eights, we gon' need a zip
I'ma keep it pimp, he gon' keep it simp
I know it feel good, you could bite your lip
Get pussy away and the price gon' dip
Give the pussy to me, I'ma bite your hips
Take me to the back, show me where it's at
You better have that crack, where it's at
Pussy like Thrilla in Minalla
It knock niggas out, laying on chinchilla
You could smoke with me bro, I'm really not a dealer
I just got a lot of weed, I like to share it with my niggas
I think we need to have a smoke break
This world wrong, we just let it rotate
I tell her okay, go play that 'Yonce
Fuck me like you tryna be fianc√©

[Hook:]
They see us when we ball, we be acting up
Getting calls from your broad, we be acting up
Pull up coop to the mall, see me acting up
Back in the morning, I'm acting up
Hoes see us when we ball, yeah we acting up
If she say we fell in love, she be acting up
And my city sold out, acting up
They don't do it like us, we be acting up

I took a trip and I hope I don't take no losses
Met some fake niggas and I met some bosses
Baby dripping wet, running like a faucet
I do it like a vet but I just started
Vouch for the pussy, you could put my name on it
Baby bend it over then she flex on it
Paid for it in advance, put a check on it
I just see you in the streets, nigga we ain't homies
We ain't homies, we ain't homies
Turnt up in the city if you're looking for me
You only see when I'm shining
Better get used to it hoe, cause that shit's all the time
You say you from the streets, well you gotta show me
How you speak up on me if you don't know me
That's what I get enough of
Throw them dubs up, we gon' fuck the club up

[Hook:]
They see us when we ball, we be acting up
Getting calls from your broad, we be acting up
Pull up coop to the mall, see me acting up
Back in the morning, I'm acting up
Hoes see us when we ball, yeah we acting up
If she say we fell in love, she be acting up
And my city sold out, acting up
They don't do it like us, we be acting up

This that, this shit remind me of that Summer '09 shit
Priceless, yeah
Shout out to all my young niggas
West side, East side, yeah, LA, Inglewood
Aw man, Live & Grow
We be acting up
Yeah, aw, we be acting up
Yeah, we be acting up
