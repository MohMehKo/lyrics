[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, these thoughts weigh a pound
Get it paid [?] to my people
This life full of strange gotta look through the peephole
Paid the price for some things, it was going up for repo
I done piped down some things that I never thought I'd see yo
Left town, came back with a whole new visual
I'm so new addition times Hov [?] who you kidding
My flows, used to mention my hoes
Steady squinching [?] but she'll never seen through me
Just put in jacuzzis, this a Spike Lee movie
Niggas did the right thing
Like get your mom a crib or put on for your team
Remember three years back it was nothing more than a dream
Now I'm thinking mortgage payments
Vacation, baby, arrange it
It's to my entertainment that haters facing this danger
I'm eating lobster and shrimp and you niggas is still faced it [?]
My cousins pockets was slim and he started moving cases
And then we put it together and spread it through the ages

[Hook: Raheem DeVaughn]
And here we are (we are)
Here we are
Face to face with all our dreams
Earning pesos for our thoughts
For our thoughts they weigh a pound
And we ride, and we're here
To conquer (to conquer)
For those pesos for our thoughts
For out thoughts they weigh a pound

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
I feel like they shoulda been crowned me
For real life is why my pen dropped ink
Swear I coulda been
Started to make that shit
That these artists think is a hit
But it's harder to make you think
That makeup is for Maybelline
That got girl know she got it
I should go grab her another drink
And she rollin' and wildin'
I might as well put her on the team
I'm some multi-dimensional
Whatchu think I'm winning for
Go and drop it for this young nigga with grown man credentials
Now I'm stopping for this young nigga
This feeling is so [?]
And she know that we poppin'
She popped up right at the show
Live alternative lifestyle, affirmative right now
As her horns got old style to mix with the right vowels
Niggas go to college and come back so hopeless
In the city that they stay help 'em get more potent
Back to the game and ulterior motives
Help them get more focused as they get more older

[Hook]
