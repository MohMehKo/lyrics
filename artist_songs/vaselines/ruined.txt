Why the fuck can't you see what's going on?
I know, you know, we both ran
'Cause what can you do when I care for you
But what can I say, what I, I got, I got to say

Smack, crack, you'll get back
You'll have a heart attack
You're never coming back
Ruined, ruined

I think you got it wrong
Can't write a decent song
We all will sing along
Ruined, ruined

In the papers everyday
With nothing new to say
I wish you'd go away
Ruined, ruined

Don't believe the hype
I can smell the type
Pissed off every night
Ruined, ruined

You'll die
We'll all sigh
You'll go sky high
Through the roof

You'll die
We'll all sigh
You'll go sky high
Through the roof

Let's have a bit of rough
You think you're really tough
But just not hard enough
Ruined, ruined

We could get famous too
From different sniffing glue
The kids are on to you
Ruined, ruined

A living miracle
To all the cynical
Play pop and poppin' pills
Ruined, ruined

It's nearly over now
You should be asking how
There should be golden cow
Ruined, ruined

You'll die
We'll all sigh
You'll go sky high
Through the roof

You'll die
We'll all sigh
You'll go sky high
Through the roof
