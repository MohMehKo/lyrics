I've got the devil
The devil's inside me
I've got the devil in me
And it won't let go

I've got the devil
The devil's inside me
I've got the devil in me

He made me fight
He made you fall
He made me push you
Against the wall

I've got the devil
The devil's inside me
I've got the devil in me

And it won't let go, oh
Won't let me go, oh

I've got the devil
The devil's inside me
I've got the devil in me
And it won't let go

I've got the devil
The devil's inside me
I've got the devil in me

He made me wild
He made you steal
I want to hurt just to
Hear you squeal

I've got the devil
The devil's inside me
I've got the devil in me

And it won't let go, oh
Won't let me go, oh

I've got the devil
The devil's inside me
I've got the devil in me
And it won't let go

I've got the devil
The devil's inside me
I've got the devil in me

He made me creep
And made you crawl
He made me so
I don't care at all

I've got the devil
The devil's inside me
I've got the devil in me

And it won't let go, oh
Won't let me go, oh
