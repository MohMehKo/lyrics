I've no appetite for you and me
When you twist me 'round like some old spaghetti
Eat you up and spit you out
Left a bad taste I can do without

Hey, fat mama, I'm a fat man
Hey, fat mama, I'm a fat man
Hey, fat mama, I'm a fat man
Hey, fat mama, I'm a fat man

You're gonna use a knife to take a slice
And cut me out of your life
You're gonna use a knife to take a slice
And cut me out of your life

It's a recipe we have to follow
Take heartache and a pinch of sorrow
Let it simmer for a year or two
Serve it up and then we're through

Hey, fat mama, I'm a fat man
Hey, fat mama, I'm a fat man
Hey, fat mama, I'm a fat man
Hey, fat mama, I'm a fat man

You're gonna use a knife to take a slice
And cut me out of your life
You're gonna use a knife to take a slice
And cut me out of your life

It's not my fault, it's not big bowls
It's not my age or my hormones
On a diet of cold rejection
I got sick with no affection

Hey, fat mama, I'm a fat man
Hey, fat mama, I'm a fat man
Hey, fat mama, I'm a fat man
Hey, fat mama, I'm a fat man

You're gonna use a knife to take a slice
And cut me out of your life
You're gonna use a knife to take a slice
And cut me out of your life

You're gonna use a knife to take a slice
And cut me out of your life
You're gonna use a knife to take a slice
And cut me out of your life
