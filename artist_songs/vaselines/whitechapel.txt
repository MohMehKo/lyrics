I got the feelin' you
(I heard her call)
And I'm runnin'
(I heard her call)

This feelin' from you
(I heard her call)
And it's hurtin'

Tonight, tonight
This wonderful night
Tonight, tonight
This wonderful night

Why do you follow me?
(I heard her call)
It's a weakness
(I heard her call)

You live off my fears
(I heard her call)
And I'm helpless

Tonight, tonight
This wonderful night
Tonight, tonight
This wonderful night

And now that you're so near
(I heard her call)
Suffocating
(I heard her call)

The look in your eyes
(I heard her call)
Why are you waiting

Tonight, tonight
This wonderful night
Tonight, tonight
This wonderful night

Tonight, tonight
This wonderful night
Tonight, tonight
This wonderful night

Tonight, tonight
This wonderful night
Tonight, tonight
This wonderful night

I heard her call
