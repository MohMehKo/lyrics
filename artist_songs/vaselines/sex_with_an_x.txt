Feels so good, it must be bad for me
Feels so good, it must be bad for me
Feels so good, it must be bad for me
Let's do it, let's do it again

You look so right, you must be wrong for me
You look so right, you must be wrong for me
You look so right, you must be wrong for me
Let's do it, let's do it again

Help me, help me, my resolve is breaking
I've given up, I'm going down
I've done too much of all this stuff
That I was warned, "Do not touch"

Feels so good, it must be bad for me
Feels so good, it must be bad for me
Feels so good, it must be bad for me
Let's do it, let's do it again

You look so right, you must be wrong for me
You look so right, you must be wrong for me
You look so right, you must be wrong for me
Let's do it, let's do it again

Stop me, stop me, please forgive me
I'm too blind to see the light
I've been cursed but now it's worse
I don't know what I did last night

Save me, save me, temptation's breaking
I gave in to all you had
I confess to all the mess
When darkness fell I was bad

Feels so good, it must be bad for me
Feels so good, it must be bad for me
Feels so good, it must be bad for me
Let's do it, let's do it again

You look so right, you must be wrong for me
You look so right, you must be wrong for me
You look so right, you must be wrong for me
Let's do it, let's do it again

Feels so good, it must be bad for me
Feels so good, it must be bad for me
Feels so good, it must be bad for me
Let's do it, let's do it again

You look so right, you must be wrong for me
You look so right, you must be wrong for me
You look so right, you must be wrong for me
Let's do it, let's do it again
