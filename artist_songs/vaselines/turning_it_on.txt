I should have met you a long time ago
Maybe I did but I didn't know
I can see that you're willing, I can see that you care
Unlikely couple, unhappy affair

Chance an encounter, a narrow escape
The danger, the fun and the thrill of the chase
All in my head, it's a fantasy then
I'm plottin' the time and I see you again

Take me, fate, don't leave me alone
Darkness lies beyond
Take me, fate, don't leave me alone
Darkness lies beyond

It's the beginning and it is the end
Philosophical thoughts, I can't defend
You're not my type, it's your mind I respect
I've heard it before but don't say it yet

Take me, fate, don't leave me alone
Darkness lies beyond
Take me, fate, don't leave me alone
Darkness lies beyond

You would know what goes on in my head
You should know this I'm easily led
One sign of affection can lead me astray
It's turnin' you on but I'm turnin' away

Take me, fate, don't leave me alone
Darkness lies beyond
Take me, fate, don't leave me alone
Darkness lies beyond

Take me, fate, don't leave me alone
Darkness lies beyond
Take me, fate, don't leave me alone
Darkness lies beyond
