What has become of me?
Sleepin' endlessly
Heartbeat, heartbeat
My heartbeat is weak

The blood in my veins
Leaves me in shame
The moons pull is strong
Something, something is wrong

Don't even try
It's only goodbye
Don't even try
Bye, bye

What has become of me?
All there for you to see
Heartbeat, heartbeat
My heartbeat's not gone

Darkness can't hide
My other side
The sun's hit the ground
I will, I will be found

Don't even try
It's only goodbye
Don't even try
Bye, bye

What has become of me?
Livin' eternally
Heartbeat, heartbeat
My heartbeat's still strong

With this breath I take
I am awake
The sun's in my eyes
I'm ready, I'm ready to rise

Don't even try
It's only goodbye
Don't even try
Bye, bye

Don't even try
It's only goodbye
Don't even try
Bye, bye

Try, try
Bye, bye, bye
Try, try
Bye, bye, bye
Try, try
Bye, bye, bye
Try, try
Bye, bye, bye
