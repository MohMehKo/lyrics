There was you and MTV
Pink speed emptied me
There goes the DayGlo generation
What's my motivation?

Brain like a Rubik's cube
Didn't notice we got screwed
Now the party's over
Nothing left but the hangover

What do you know?
You weren't there
It wasn't all
Duran-Duran, Duran-Duran

You want the truth?
Well, this is it
I hate the '80s
'Cause the '80s were shit

You put a bullet in a Beatle
Started beating on the people
A wall that wasn't there
A war that lead nowhere

And it's all coming down
No point in hanging around
But where did that girl go
And what did that boy know?

What do you know?
You weren't there
It wasn't all
Duran-Duran, Duran-Duran

You want the truth?
Well, this is it
I hate the '80s
'Cause the '80s were shit

What do you know?
You weren't there
It wasn't all
Duran-Duran, Duran-Duran

You want the truth?
Well, this is it
I hate the '80s
'Cause the '80s were shit

Where did that girl go?
What did that boy know?
Where did that girl go?
What did that boy know?

Where did that girl go?
What did that boy know?
Where did that girl go?
What did that boy know?
