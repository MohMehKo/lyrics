Kiss me, I'm in season
You make me this way
It all could be so easy
Like kissin' with a K

Blood pressure's high
Don't let me die
It's an emergency

My pulse is slow
Not my time to go
Put your lips on me

Give me mouth to mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth, mouth
Mouth to mouth to mouth

Give me mouth to mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth, mouth
Mouth to mouth to mouth

Touch me with some feelin'
Please lead me astray
My tired bones need healin'
Start kissin' with a K

Blood pressure's high
Don't let me die
It's an emergency

My pulse is slow
Not my time to go
Put your lips on me

Give me mouth to mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth, mouth
Mouth to mouth to mouth

Give me mouth to mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth, mouth
Mouth to mouth to mouth

Love me for this evenin'
I won't disturb your day
There will be no meanin'
Just a kiss without a K

Blood pressure's high
Don't let me die
It's an emergency

My pulse is slow
Not my time to go
Put your lips on me

Give me mouth to mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth, mouth
Mouth to mouth to mouth

Give me mouth to mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth, mouth
Mouth to mouth to mouth

Give me mouth to mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth, mouth
Mouth to mouth to mouth

Give me mouth to mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth, mouth
Mouth to mouth to mouth
