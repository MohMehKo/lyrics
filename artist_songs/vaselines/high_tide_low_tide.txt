Lonely by the riverside
Playing hard to get
I’m confused but can’t decide
Whether to get wet
There’s no place I’d rather be
Something holds me back
Is there a look of fight in me
I’m ready to attack

High tide low tide
When’re we going to get a ride
Right across the water
Want to meet someone’s daughter
High tide low tide
When am I going to get a ride
Right across the ocean
Want to feel some emotion

Lonely by the riverside
Gonna make her wait
I’m confused but can’t decide
Leaving it too late.

High tide low tide
When’re we going to get a ride
Right across the water
Want to meet someone’s daughter
High tide low tide
When am I going to get a ride
Right across the ocean
Want to feel some emotion

There’s no place I’d rather be
Want to take her home
If she keeps ignoring me
I’ll end up skin and bone

High tide low tide
When’re we going to get a ride
Right across the water
Want to meet someone’s daughter
High tide low tide
When am I we going to get a ride
Right across the ocean
Want to feel some emotion [x2]
