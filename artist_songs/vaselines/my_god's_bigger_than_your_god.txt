My God's bigger than your God
My God's bigger than your God
My God's bigger than your God
My God's bigger than your God

He'll slap you down with a smack in the face
Spread your nose all over the place
Yahweh, Buddha, Jesus, Zeus
Catch you on and on, one and two
Destroy you all with the stamp of his foot

It makes no sense
It makes no sense at all
When you don't follow
When you hear me call

My God's bigger than your God
My God's bigger than your God
My God's bigger than your God
My God's bigger than your God

Get you in a headlock, twist your arm
Listen boy, I'm gonna [Incomprehensible] harm
Yahweh, Buddha, Jesus, Zeus
Knock you out with the blast of his tune
Rip you up with a left hook soon

It makes no sense
It makes no sense at all
When you don't follow
When you hear me call

My God's bigger than your God
My God's bigger than your God
My God's bigger than your God
My God's bigger than your God

Scratch your eyes and pull your hair
Your gloves are off, I don't play fair
Yahweh, Buddha, Jesus, Zeus
Don't turn your back, don't turn it yet
See the bruises you're gonna get

It makes no sense
It makes no sense at all
When you don't follow
When you hear me call
