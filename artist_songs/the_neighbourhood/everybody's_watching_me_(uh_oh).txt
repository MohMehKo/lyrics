[Verse 1:]
I told you I would tell you everything you want to know
You want me to tell you now
You pressure me to shout it
Need to hear about it
Think that I would count you out

[Bridge:]
I let you find it on your own
Then I found myself alone

[Hook:]
Uh oh, where can I go?
Everybody's watching me
Uh oh, where can I go?
Everybody's watching me
Ooh ooh, what can I do
If you're not here to tell you?
Uh oh, where can I go?
Everybody's watching me

[Verse 2:]
I go through all the trouble of keeping it within my walls
I try to be as subtle as I can
Assume that nothing needs me, all I've done defeats me
It looks like you were right again
And again

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
The more I want in, the more I want in
The less I know, the less I know
But I'm forgotten, I'm forgotten
I'll be alone, I'll be alone, I'll be alone
With everybody watching me

[Hook]

Watching me, watching me, me, me
They're watching me, me, me
Watching me, me, me, me
Everybody's watching me
