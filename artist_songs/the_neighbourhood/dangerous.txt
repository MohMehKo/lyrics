[Intro - The Neighbourhood:]
Ridin' round in my city, same thing I used to do
Got a new girl with me
I could have another one if I wanted to, but no
Might call another one this afternoon, I won't

[Verse 1 - The Neighbourhood:]
Ridin' round in my city, same thing I used to do
Got a new girl with me
I could have another one if I wanted to, but no
Might call another one this afternoon, I won't
I did it, look who I brought with me
Ridin' round your city, vibin' out in your city
Sold out in your city, but I think you earned this
I feel like you're worth it
Your blue eyes and those red lips
That got you on my guest list
Don't talk much, I don't say shit
And you lay down and we make it up
Fuck what your mother say, let's run away
We play on that gold chain
Drivin' round in my Escalade
Doin' 88 on PCH, let's go

[Hook - The Neighbourhood:]
We're made to love, We're made to love
We're made to love, We're made to love
(But) you're dangerous
You're dangerous, you're dangerous
For both of us
You're dangerous

[Verse 2 - YG:]
Texting and calling, while I'm with my bitch
You be puttin' me through some shit
But that pussy good as shit
Now she goin' through my shit
Ask me, "Who is this? Who's that?"
Smell my dick and asked last night where you was at
So if I lie now she'll probably find the truth later
But if I tell the truth she'll probably wanna leave a player
And if she leave a player, who I'm gon' fuck with
Can't fuck with you cause you too comfortable being my side bitch
But fuck that, I told her
Damn that wasn't smart, damn I fucked up
Now that arguing 'bout to start
She like, "Who is this? Did she suck yo dick?
Oh this that same-wait, YG do you love this bitch?
This the same chick from last time, I saw you creepin' with
You took her out to eat and shit, ooh I hate this bitch."
God damn, I gotta put a end to this triangle relationship
I gotta stay away from you cause your pussy too dangerous

[Hook]
