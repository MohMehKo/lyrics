You need to get off my mind...

I'm never satisfied.
It's never good enough.
I always seem to find the right,
Formula for putting up, yeah.

I tried to love you, baby.
In every way, in every way.
I tried to satisfy you, honey.
But you wouldn't stay, you wouldn't stay

I'm like a clover and rye.
You hang it out on me.
If I really want to find someone else,
I'll find some company.
Hey-yeah.

I'm in a hurry out, wouldn't worry about a little hiccup.
Why can't you see?
Why can't you see?
Why can't you see, that I am sick of this love.

I tried to love you, baby.
In every way, in every way.
I tried to satisfy you, honey.
But you wouldn't stay, you wouldn't stay

I tried to love you, baby.
In every way, in every way.
I tried to satisfy you, honey.
But you wouldn't stay, you wouldn't stay

(I knew it was wrong, but I thought about you still)

Girl, I do not know.
Where you're running to.
I'm your finish, love,
I'm the one for you.

If you do me wrong,
If I'm cruel to you,
You're a fool for me,
I'm a fool for you.

Shawty been talking about her new options,
But options do not mean that they're competition
The master key perfectly fits your ignition.
Forever under the greatest possession.
You are not foreign at all to this sentence.
Hopefully this is the first time you did this shit.
