I know a couple girls like you
But they don't do it like you do
I hope we can go round two
Cause you know I wanna do it again
[x2]

Being away from her, it makes me hurt, it makes me sad
I'll try to find another way, to make it work
I hate to lurk, I'll never learn
But I hope I learn it sometime soon because
You better watch your mouth
I know everything that you're all about
I know what to say that will make you cry
But I know we're gonna do it again
I better watch my words
I know what to say that will make you hurt
I know what to say that will make you cry
But I know we're gonna do it again
