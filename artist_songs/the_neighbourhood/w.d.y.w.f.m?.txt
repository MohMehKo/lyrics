[Verse 1:]
Two nights ago, she got that look in her eyes
Kaleidoscope, but that's only half the time
Three days before she told me that I don't even try
She's crazy, though, I guess there's something wrong inside

[Hook:]
Maybe you're right, maybe this is all that I can be
But what if it's you, and it wasn't me?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?

[Verse 2:]
Four weeks ahead, I thought that I should think some more
I'm fucked in the head, and my mind is turning into a whore
Five months go by, and I thought about letting her go
She's crazy, though, and I guess she took control
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Maybe she's right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe we'll fight 'til it move us along
I can't deny writing this song
Hoping she'll find she's not alone

[Hook]
