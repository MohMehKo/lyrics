So so so sorry
But your lady's with me
Actually that is just where you wanted her to be
But she told you already
You need to just forget it
So she told me
Thats she is M.I.N.E
When it comes to other guys she's only there to see
When it comes to the Embedded
I bet it'll never happen so...

It's too bad that she's on my arm
But for you she's not [x2]
I felt bad when I heard you lost
But for you she's not
For you I just don't feel pity
We're so pitiful (pitiful pitiful)
She's so pretty
You're so pitiful (pitiful pitiful)

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
So so so shitty
To be you right now
Soon you will see pictures of us kissing on the mouth
But she made it very clear
It wasn't happenin' this year
Or even any time
In the next ten centuries
Outside of the box she started venturing
I texted back the letter
Am I any?
She said yes thats...

It's too bad that she's on my arm
But for you she's not [x2]
I felt bad when I heard you lost
But for you she's not
For you I just don't feel pity
We're so pitiful (pitiful pitiful)
She's so pretty
You're so pitiful (pitiful pitiful)

I hate her new boyfriend
He listens to the song and will hope to god that she never sings along
He plays guitar too
He played along to all our favorite music
On a burnt CD
Just him and his acoustic
I listen intently to every sentence she tells me but so does he
I would tell him to go away but that is too low for me
I know you hate me out of jealou$y but don't be please
It all might change if you just spoke to me

It's too bad that she's on my arm
But for you she's not [x2]
I felt bad when I heard you lost
But for you she's not
For you I just don't feel pity
We're so pitiful (pitiful pitiful)
She's so pretty
You're so pitiful (pitiful pitiful)

Pitiful pitiful pity
Pitiful pitiful [x7]
