[Baby Came Home 2]

She was five foot four
With some money on the floor
And box that's hidden under her bed
I was only twenty two
With a pocket full of truth
But I gave her everything that I had
We were born and raised in the Golden State
Mommy's gone and daddy's doing his best
I was brought up great living Section 8
Social security's paying the rent
The landlord called, she said you gotta go
Little one you just lost your

She was five foot four
Getting money on tour
But her socks were at the end of my bed
Got our names tattooed on each other
Just to prove to each other
That we'd do what we said
Only took a few days
'Til our minds were made up
And we thought we should try it again
I was only 17 when we first tried things
When she first made me feel like a man

To those of you in which I choose,
To always be the closest to,
Something that you need to know,
Loving me is not a joke,

You can put it all on me,
You can laugh and you can bleed,
And I'll adopt it all because,
That's just what a buddy does,

I loved you from minute one,
The iced tea to my lemonade,
Never one to hit and run,
Soaking every minute made,

You can give me all your juice,
I can squeeze it out for you,
All I ask you in exchange,
Love me back through every phase,

If it ever comes off wrong,
Or leaves you with a bitter taste,
Just remember you're the tea
And I'm your sour lemonade, I'm your sour lemonade,
Tropical iced tea and hot pink lemonade.ï»¿
