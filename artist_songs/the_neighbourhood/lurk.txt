[Distorted:]
Hey! [x8]
This is the beat that makes your mother cry...

[Verse 1:]
I want to be honest
I want to be bad
I want to destroy you
I want to move fast
I want the attention
I want all the cash
I want all the ass
Is it too much to ask?

I want to be faithful
I want to be raw
I want to be ignorant
I want to know it all
I want to die someday
I want to live long
I want what I ask for
I get what I want

[Hook x2:]
I'm thinking we should ride
To a place that we don't know
To a place where no one's seen us before
I'm thinking, you and I
Better just go with the flow
Last thing that we should do is go slow

[Distorted:]
Hey! [x8]
This is the beat that makes your mother cry...

[Verse 2:]
I think that I'm human
I think about God
I think of the chances
I think that I'm wrong

I think to be thoughtful
I know that I'm not
You think I'm a fake
And I know you're a fraud

I fuck 'cause I need to
I fuck when I want
I'll fuck you in love
Even though it is not

I'll fucking digest you
One kiss at a time
You wish I was yours
And I hope that you're mine.

[Hook x2]

Go fast, go fast
Hey! [x8]
Go fast, go fast
This is the beat that makes your mother cry
Oh, no...

Black and it's white
Everything's white
But it's blacker than I know
And blacker than the white of the snow, yeah
And I'm thinking I...
Oh, no...
