[Intro - DJ Drama:]
Black and white The Neighbourhood
The west coast is the best coast
The best smoke, the best weather
The best bitches, can't wait 'till my flight land
G-Eazy fuck with us

[Verse 1 - Jesse Rutherford:]
When I get back to California
I'll see my sister and my momma
I'll tell my friends about my fast life
Because they know me from my past life
When I get back to California
I'll smoke a pound of marijuana
I'll sit inside and watch the sun set
All by myself in my apartment
Oh, I'll take the long way home
When I get back to California
I hope I push my paranoia
I'm parched because I'm not a god

[Chorus - Jesse Rutherford:]
I've got no time to kill
But when I get home
Baby I will
I can't wait 'till you're back to California
I can't wait 'till you're back to California
I can't wait 'till you're back to California
I can't wait 'till you're back to California

[Interlude - G-Eazy:]
I'll be home soon

[Verse 2 - G-Eazy:]
Killing brain cells, killing time
When I finally get back I'll be feeling fine
Hope I get to chill out in my twenties while I'm still in mine
Tap right out the matrix but I'm just out here
Maneuvering until it's time
On the road know my girl be going through it
But I'm a fucking star and I know I was born to do it
Summer gone and past I'm always touring through it
And my penthouse apartment
Is feeling more like an expensive storage unit
Oh well, poor guy, in real life I'm more shy
I just wanna hide, they just be like "Bruh but for why?"
Everybody wants a favor or a slice of your pie
Live a fast life, I'ma either get rich or die
So I, pass out faded then I dream of home
Thinking 'bout the time I really need alone
I'ma go for walks around the town you might even see me roam
Fuck it I don't even really need a phone
Man I'm just tryna chill

[Chorus]

[Outro - Jesse Rutherford:]
I know the sun's still shining
I know the sun's still shining
I know the sun's still shining
I know the sun's still shining
