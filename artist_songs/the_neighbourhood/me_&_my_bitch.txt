I used to have a girlfriend
Now all I got is hoes
I was looking for a down girl
But she was fucking on the low, yeah

Hair done, nails did, caramel complexion
Pussy stayed wet like she was mixed with Mexican
Love I invested in, trust I invested in
So if she wasn't fucking with me I was stressing it
Wasn't no questioning that, pussy was mine
Wasn't no questioning that, Bonnie and Clyde
Living in my mama's house, but I let her move in mama thought I was tricking
But really I was just choosing
Bitch, I was claiming her when we was fucking
My bitch, I wasn't using condoms no nothing
She was my love, she came first before my homies
Like fuck it, I'm 'bout to get your name tatted on me

I used to have a girlfriend
Now all I got is hoes
I was looking for a down girl
And she was fucking on the low
Now it's me and my bitch, yeah
Cause knowing that these hoes ain't shit
Me and my bitch
And we were riding on this west-coast shit, yeah

I caught the bitch cheating
Damn, she was with him last weekend
What you mean you gon' call right back?
What you mean you ain't got time like that?
She fucked this player I knew
Didn't really fuck with his crew
I did a song with his brother
And she fucked with him too
All that shit she was talking
She wasn't really 'bout it
And it made it even worse
When my homie told me 'bout it
I gave you your swag, told you to dress like that
I hit your spot, made you say "yes!" like that
And they ask me why I trust no bitch
It's cause my ex had me feeling all embarrassed and shit

I used to have a girlfriend
Now all I got is hoes
I was looking for a down girl
And she was fucking on the low
And now it's me and my bitch, yeah, yeah
Knowing that these hoes ain't shit
Me and my bitch
And we were riding on this west-coast shit, yeah

So she tryna get me back now
I had her creeping, even sneaking through the back door
I was horny, I just wanted to fuck
I bust a nut in ten minutes, I was in a rush, yeah
She said it and she swears now
All she knows that I could've been a dad now
She text me like, "I love you"
I touch her back like, "Fuck you"

yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, oh, no

I used to have a girlfriend
Now all I got is hoes
I was looking for a down girl
She was fucking on the low
So it's me and my bitch, yes
Knowing that these hoes ain't shit
Me and my bitch
And we were riding on this west-coast shit, woah, yeah
