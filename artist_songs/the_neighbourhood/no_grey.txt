Money, money, money

First things first
I don't wanna be forgotten
Even worse
I don't wanna be alone

But if it all stops today
I'll probably say
I didn't waste my minutes
When I'm finished

Brand new faith
And I'm ready for the camera's mention
And all I pay
And my money and my damn attention

Didn't get me the deal
Got me to feel
How you would hear my sentence
When I'm finished

You could do it for the money, money, money
But the money makes them all the same
Everything's sunny, sunny, sunny
But the sunshine fades away

Everything's black
And white
No grey.

Pitch black frames
You can see me when I wear my lenses
And all they say
Is I'm fake and I don't get offended

And when push comes to shove
I'll show enough
I didn't need to listen
When I'm finished

"You're insane"
What you said when I explained the game plan
Nothing's changed
Except a little more change in my hand

Now I don't mean to brag, life was a drag
But now with the shows and women, and it's not finished 

You could do it for the money, money, money
But the money makes them all the same
Everything's sunny, sunny, sunny
But the sunshine fades away

Everything's black
And white
No grey

It ended up with gold, but it started as a dream
If I get cold, put some honey in my tea

I used to be broke, now there's money in my jeans

I was broke now there's money in my jeans [x3]

You could do it for the money, money, money
But the money makes them all the same
Everything's sunny, sunny, sunny
But the sunshine fades away

Everything's black
And white
No grey

Everything's black
And white
No grey
