[Hook:]
It don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' bout you and I
No I don't wanna do it, I keep thinkin' bout you and I
What the fuck am I supposed to do about you and I
What the fuck are we supposed to do about you and I
It don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' bout you and I
No I don't wanna do it, I keep thinkin' bout you and I
What the fuck am I supposed to do about you and I
What the fuck are we supposed to do about you and I

[Verse 1:]
I want you to know, I need you to be
Someone for me in my life, I can't let you go
But you cheated on me
And now everybody thinks that you're the bad guy
Well guess what, I think that you are baby
I think you need some discipline baby
And I think about you kissing him baby
Fuck that guy, happy I don't know his name
I'll go ahead and let him play
And I can't try to control your brain

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I'm listening, when you're asking
What do you see, behind those eyes
Cause I brought some shades
But when you're away
My love never seems to come out right
But it's hard to remember dreams baby
And I know you won't tell everything baby
But you say I'm on your memory baby
That's fine, fuck I think I know his name now
I hope that I don't go insane now
If so I'll have to blow his brains out

[Voicemail - Anabel Englund:]
Right, I still love you
Even though you’re a fucking cunt douchebag
And I’m sure you feel the same about me
But, whatever, that’s it
