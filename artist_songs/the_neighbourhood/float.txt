[Verse 1:]
Imagine breathing in
Imagine leaving all your air behind
What matters in the end
A matter of opinion 'til you find out

[Bridge:]
Life can only mean hardly anything
All I'll ever be is partly settled in

[Hook:]
They show you how to swim, then they throw you in the deep end
I've been learning since, but it doesn't mean I'll float
I won't float, no, no, no, no,
Won't float

[Verse 2:]
I had a funny sleep,
I didn't have a dream
'Cause I don't believe in them

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Float away, float away, then come right back to me
Float away, float away, then come right back to me

[Hook]

[Verse 4:]
What if I, what if I don't float?
What if I don't float?
I think I'll float, I'll float
I'll float away
