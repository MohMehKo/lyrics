Goddamn, you're the man
Higher than the world around
Goddamn, you're the man
Watch him as he holds you down
Black pants tailored man
All your words are so profound
Black pants superman
With the self-inflicted smile
Stream line so refined
Fell into yourself and drowned
Walk tall, no remorse
I'm about to lose it

Take your money
Take your empty dreams
Break the cycle
Cut the cord that feeds
I'm out here standin' on the
Edge of insanity
So take your money
Take your empty dreams
Cause I'm falling down
Falling down
Cause I'm falling down
Falling down

Goddamn, you're the man
Higher than the world around
Goddamn hypocrite
Acting like you feel concerned
Neck tie, inside's
Darker than the desk you ride
I can't understand
Why you let them do this

Take your money
Take your empty dreams
Break the cycle
Cut the cord that feeds
I'm out here standin' on the
Edge of insanity
So take your money
Take your empty dreams
Cause I'm falling down
Falling down
Cause I'm falling down
Falling down

It's the blow back
It's the premonition
It's the contact
It's the termination
It's the blow back
It's the premonition
It's the contact

Only if you breathe
Only if you breathe

It's the blow back
It's the premonition
It's the contact (Only if you breathe)
It's the termination
It's the blow back
It's the premonition
It's the contact

Take your money
Take your empty dreams
Break the cycle
Cut the cord that feeds
I'm out here standin' on the
Edge of insanity
So take your money
Take your empty dreams
Cause I'm falling down
Falling down
Cause I'm falling down
Falling down
