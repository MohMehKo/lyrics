Head down on a pillow of concrete
I won't rest in peace either way
And I won't be forgiven
And I will never give in
I'll give you something if you wanna believe

Won't ever belong
Just wanna be free

I'm a wanted man
Got blood on my hands
You keep tellin' me to back down
Won't do it
Livin' on the wrong side of a bullet
I'm a wanted man
Never stood a chance
Renegade from the day that I knew it
Livin' on the wrong side of a bullet

Laid down in a garden of envy
Time is standin' still every day
And I won't be forgiven
And I will never give in
I'll save you something but I can not be saved

Won't ever belong
Just wanna be free

I'm a wanted man
Got blood on my hands
You keep tellin' me to back down
Won't do it
Livin' on the wrong side of a bullet
I'm a wanted man
Never stood a chance
Renegade from the day that I knew it
Livin' on the wrong side of a bullet

And if i get out alive
I won't be on my knees (Yeah, yeah)
And if I get out alive...

I'm a wanted man
Got blood on my hands
You keep tellin' me to back down
Won't do it
Livin' on the wrong side of a bullet
I'm a wanted man
Never stood a chance
Renegade from the day that I knew it
Livin' on the wrong side of a bullet
