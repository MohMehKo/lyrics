Time
Time is holding onto everything
Behind the curtain pulling every string
It's slowly running down
And there is no escaping it

Out here in the cold
With all that I've sold
I'd rather die here
Then live here alone
I'd rather die here

My candle burns
You never know when it's your turn
Not gonna wait for it
Waste one breath
Steal the hourglass
And don't let it fall

Time
Time is holding on to everything
Behind the curtain pulling every string
It's slowly running down
And there is no escaping it

Out here in the cold
With all that I've sold
I'd rather die here
Then live here alone
I'd rather die here

My candle burns
You never know when it's your turn
Not gonna wait for it
Waste one breath
Steal the hourglass
And don't let it fall

My candle burns...

[?]
Right to the edge...

My candle burns
You never know when it's your turn
Not gonna wait for it
Waste one breath
Steal the hourglass
Don't let it fall

My candle...
My candle burns
