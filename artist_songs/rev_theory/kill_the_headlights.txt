Playin' on the safe side
Letting life slip by
You tell yourself another lie
Every single day
Every single day

You got to jump in head first
You might get hurt
But it's all worth it
In the end

Just kill the headlights
I want you to see
All that's in sight
To get where you want
Take your hands off the wheel
Kill the headlights
You've got all you need
On the inside
Just kill the headlights
And turn the radio up

You're dreamin' of another life
You're holdin' on too tight
When you gonna reaize
Everything can change
Everything can change

You got to jump in head first
You might get hurt
But it's all worth it
In the end

Just kill the headlights
I want you to see
All that's in sight
To get where you want
Take your hands off the wheel
Kill the headlights
You've got all you need
On the inside
Just kill the headlights
And turn the radio up

Turn the radio up
Yeah
Yeah

Playin' on the safe side
Letting life slip by
You tell yourself another lie
Every single day
Every single day

You got to kill the headlights
I want you to see
All that's in sight
To get where you want
Take your hands off the wheel
Kill the headlights
You've got all you need
On the inside
Just kill the headlights
And turn the radio up

Jump in head first
You might get hurt (Turn the radio up)
But it's all worth it

(Turn the radio up)

Jump in head first
You might get hurt (Turn the radio up)
But it's all worth it

In the end
