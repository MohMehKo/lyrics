Love to hate, repeating my mistakes
Now there's no one left to listen
No one left to listen
Take a chance and fuck the consequence
When there's no one left to listen 
No one left to listen

Right now, we're taking control
Tired of waiting, tired of waiting
For something new
Right now, we're taking control
Tired of waiting, tired of waiting
For something new

Twist the knife 
And feed the sacrifice
When there's no one left to listen 
No one left to listen 
Say goodbye, the king will die tonight
And now everyone will listen
Everyone will listen 

Right now, we're taking control
Tired of waiting, tired of waiting
For something new
Right now, we're taking control
Tired of waiting, tired of waiting
For something new

'Cuz it's never enough
To know the truth
When you've lost all you know
There's nothing to lose

Right now, we're taking control
Tired of waiting, tired of waiting
For something new
Right now, we're taking control
Tired of waiting, tired of waiting
For something new

Right now, we're taking control
Tired of waiting, tired of waiting
For something new
