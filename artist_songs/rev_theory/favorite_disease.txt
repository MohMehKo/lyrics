Oh, oh
Oh, oh
You are my favorite disease
You are my favorite disease
Yeah

I'm sick and tired of the ways that you want me to be
Sick and tired of the shit you keep spittin'
I won't deny all the times that I wanted to leave
But I can't cause I'd miss all your bitchin' at me

And it started out so cool
Can't stand what it turned in to
Like a drug I can't kick
It's so hard to admit it to you

Cause I hate myself when I'm spun and I'm lit
Wish I wasn't addicted to you
But I can't help it
You got what I need
You are my favorite disease
You are my favorite disease

So hard to say why I keep comin' back to you
Hard to say that I like how I'm livin'
But I'm a slave to the pain that you're puttin' me through
Can't walk away cause I love what you're willin' to do

And it started out so cool
Can't stand what it turned in to
Like a drug I can't kick
It's so hard to admit it to you

Cause I hate myself when I'm spun and I'm lit
Wish I wasn't addicted to you
But I can't help it
You got what I need
You are my favorite disease

I know it's only killing both of us (You are my favorite disease)
You're not immune so don't think you can give it up
Up
Up
Yeah

Cause I hate myself when I'm spun and I'm lit
Wish I wasn't addicted to you
But I can't help it
You got what I need
You are my favorite disease
Cause I hate myself when I'm spun and I'm lit
Wish I wasn't addicted to you
But I can't help it
You got what I need
You are my favorite disease

I'm sick and tired of the ways that you want me to be
Sick and tired of the shit you keep spittin' (You are my favorite disease)
I won't deny all the times that I wanted to leave
But I can't cause I'd miss all your bitchin' at me (You are my favorite disease)

And it started out so cool (Oh, Oh)
Can't stand what it turned in to...
You are my favorite disease
