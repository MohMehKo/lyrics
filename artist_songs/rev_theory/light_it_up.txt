Hey, I want a taste
You're a black heart devil and I can't explain
Why I wait for your face
You're a hotel lover on the back end deal of this race
Every night she seems to change her name
Doesn't matter who you really are
The back room where we sip champagne
I can never seem to get enough

I ignite
So hold on
Cause we're about to light it up
It's on tonight
So hold on
Cause we're about to... about to light it up

Hey
There's no mistake
Cause I'm a hard time sinner
With a bullet to waste
And I'll break... these chains
And hit the clubhouse running with the money to play
I got the whiskey running through my veins
So cut me open, add the fuel to the fire
Your daddy tells you not to play my game
But what I'm sellin' baby she can't deny

I ignite
So hold on
Cause we're about to light it up
It's on tonight
So hold on
Cause we're about to...
I ignite
So hold on
Cause we're about to light it up

It keeps calling my name
I can't turn it away
We gotta pay to play
Yeahhhhhhh

Your daddy tells you not to play my game
But what I'm sell baby she can't deny

I ignite
So hold on
Cause we're about to light it up
It's on tonight
So hold on
Cause we're about to...
I ignite
So hold on
Cause we're about to light it up
It's on tonight
So hold on
Cause we're about to light it up
Yeah, so hold on
Cause we're about to light it up

So hold on
Cause we're about to...
About to light it up
