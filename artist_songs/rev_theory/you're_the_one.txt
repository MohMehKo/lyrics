So far away
There lies a place
That I can't touch
I hide the pain
But it's still not enough

Time after time
I keep running in circles
I can't deny what is real

You're the one
You are the hurt inside of me
And you are the one that makes me weak
Shadows that crawl all over me
Swallow the light that lets me see
Have I fallen too far away, away (I keep running away, I keep running away, I keep pushing away)
Now that it's over
It's hard to stay sober again
You're the one
You're the one (You're the one)

I lie awake (I lie awake)
Inside the darkness
I fall apart
I can't escape
From your hold on my heart

Time after time
I keep running in circles
I can't deny what is real

You're the one
You are the hurt inside of me
And you are the one that makes me weak
Shadows that crawl all over me
Swallow the light that let's me see
Have I fallen too far away, away (I keep running away, I keep running away, I keep pushing away)
Now that it's over
It's hard to stay sober again
You're the one

Running in circles
Still findin' my way
I will live for tomorrow
And not yesterday
But I can't deny what is real

(You're the one, you're the one, you're the one)
You're the one 
You are the hurt inside of me
And you are the one that makes me weak (You're the one)
Shadows that crawl all over me
Swallow the light that let's me see (You're the one)
You are the hurt inside of me
And you are the one that makes me weak (You're the one)
Shadows that crawl all over me
Swallow the light that let's me see

Have I fallen too far away, away (I keep running away, I keep running away, I keep pushing away)
Now that it's over
It's hard to stay sober again
You're the one
Yeah
