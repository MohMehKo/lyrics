Been a long time, long time coming
Been a long time
Now it's running out
Coming for you, to take you down
Live or die, live or die
At the limit
Fly to hell on a one way ticket down
There's no one around to save you now
Step right up
Eat your heart out
One taste brings you back to life

Adrenalize
One shot between the eyes
Adrenalize
Last chance before you die
Adrenalize
One shot between the eyes
Adrenalize
Last chance before you die

Been a long ride, long ride gunning
Been a long ride
Now you're coming down
Into the fire of the devil man
Never die, never die
'Til you get it
Flat line on the edge
To the other side
Where no one denies the deliverance
Step right up
Hold your arms out
One fix brings you back to life

Adrenalize
One shot between the eyes
Adrenalize
Last chance before you die
Adrenalize
One shot between the eyes
Adrenalize
Last chance before you die

Step right up
Eat your heart out
One taste brings you back to life

Adrenalize
One shot between the eyes
Adrenalize
Last chance before you die
Adrenalize
One shot between the eyes
Adrenalize
Last chance before you die
