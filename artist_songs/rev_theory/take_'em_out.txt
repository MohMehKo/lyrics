Knuckles to the ground
Hear that sound 
It's your head ringing
Silver bullet shells give 'em hell
It's a war bringing
Spitting blood in the cold out here
Ready to blow 
We'll grind them down to the bone

Take 'em out
Hit the floor, are you ready?
Take 'em out
Gonna break every levy 
Take 'em out
Here it comes, are you ready?
Take 'em out

Silence in the night 
It's the height of the moon breaking
Calm before the storm
It's the call of the undertaking 
Spitting blood in the cold out here
Ready to blow
We'll grind them down to the bone 

Take 'em out
Hit the floor, are you ready?
Take 'em out
Gonna break every levy 
Take 'em out
Here it comes, are you ready?

You better brace yourself
No one can save you now
You better brace yourself
Right now, right now
You better brace yourself
The walls are coming down
You better brace yourself
Right now, right now

Right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now

Take 'em out 
Here it comes, are you ready? 
Take 'em out 
Hit the floor, are you ready?
Take 'em out 
Gonna break every levy 
Take 'em out
Here it comes, are you ready?
Take 'em out
