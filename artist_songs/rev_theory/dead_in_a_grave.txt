Heads up man 
I'm a motherfucker 
Holding my head high 
(I'm not dead in a grave) 

I'm a sinner 
I'm a saint 
In the city of hell 
(Hey, Hey, Hey) 

Like a Molotov cocktail ready to ignite, yeah 
(I'm not dead in a grave) 
I'm gonna set this city in flames 

Don't give a fuck if I burn away 
Just take a good look now 
Cause you might miss this! 

I'm still breathin' 
Fuck your sympathy 
Don't need it 
I'll keep kickin' til' 
I'm right dead in a grave 

Can't stop now 
I'm a headcase 
Coming to get mine 
(I got something to say) 
Cold heart 
Vendetta 
Are you ready to pay 
(Hey, Hey, Hey) 
I'm a goddamn freight train 
Runnin' at midnight 
Yeah 
(so get out of the way) 
I'm locked and loaded and 
I'm still in the game 

Don't give a fuck if I burn away 
Just take a good look now 
Cause you might miss this 

I'm still breathin' 
Fuck your sympathy 
Don't need it 
I'll keep kickin' til' 
I'm right dead in a grave 
[2x]
I'll keep kickin' til' 
I'm right dead in a grave! 
(hey, hey) 
(hey, hey) 
(hey, hey) 
Yeah! 
I'm still breathin' 
Fuck your sympathy 
Don't need it 
I'll keep kickin' 
Kickin' 
Kickin' 

I'm still Breathin' 
Fuck your sympathy 
Don't need it 
I'll keep kickin' til' 
I'm right dead in a grave 

I'm still breathin' 
Fuck your sympathy 
Don't need it 
I'll keep kickin' til' 
I'm right dead in a grave 
Yeah I'm right dead in a grave! 
I'm right dead in a grave! 
(Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey)
