Stand knee deep in your emptiness
Stop this train from the obvious
Take me off life support
Quit feeding on my time while you're falling apart
Hate me for being alive
You better find a cure if you're gonna survive

Look out down below
We've lost all control
Know the alpha, the alpha, the alpha...
Look out down below
We've lost all control
Know the alpha, the alpha, the alpha KING

Bow down plead for your innocence
Heads will roll if you don't repent
Hate me for being alive
You better find a cure if you're gonna survive

Look out down below
We've lost all control
Know the alpha, the alpha, the alpha...
Look out down below
We've lost all control
Know the alpha, the alpha, the alpha KING
