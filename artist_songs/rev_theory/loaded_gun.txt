Save your soul
Even though you wanna sell it every time
Strangers call
Make you stumble, make you fall again right out of line

There goes the innocence
Where is your competence?

Don't let the sun go down
Can you stay with me awhile?
Can't face the night alone
When you're leaving here tonight

And if the the sun still shines
I will know I'm still alive
Don't let the sun go down on me tonight

Lock the door
I don't wanna know what's on the other side
Endless wars
It's up to you to make it out of here, dead or alive

Maybe the time has come
Bury the loaded gun

Don't let the sun go down
Can you stay with me awhile?
Can't face the night alone
When you're leaving me tonight

And if the the sun still shines
I will know I'm still alive
Don't let the sun go down on me tonight, tonight

Don't let the sun go down tonight
We'll make it out of here alive
Don't let the sun go down tonight
We'll make it out of here alive

Don't let the sun go down tonight
Can't face the night alone

And if the the sun still shines
I will know I'm still alive
Don't let the sun go down on me tonight
Don't let the sun go down on me tonight
Down on me tonight

Save your soul
Even though you wanna sell it every time
Strangers call
