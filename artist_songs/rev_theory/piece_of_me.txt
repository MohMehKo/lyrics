Starting to lose my patience
My vision's turning red

Hail to the coma call
(They all have fallen)
So here we go

Hey man you wanna piece of me
Step up now I'm ready to make you bleed
Hey man you wanna piece of me
Step up now I'm ready to make you pay

You wanna piece of me

Hand in your resignation
Your world is turning black

Hail to the coma call
(They all have fallen)
So here we go

Hey man you wanna piece of me
Step up now I'm ready to make you bleed
Hey man you wanna piece of me
Step up now I'm ready to make you pay

You wanna piece of me
You wanna piece of me

Can't stop the blood
I will make you pay

Hey man you wanna piece of me
Step up now I'm ready to make you...
Hey man you wanna piece of me
Step up now I'm ready to make you bleed
Hey man you wanna piece of me
Step up now I'm ready to make you pay

You wanna piece of me
You wanna piece of me
