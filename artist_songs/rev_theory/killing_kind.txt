Stop talking about a revolution
Take a minute to ease your mind
Keep coming to the same conclusion
That the world was never fine

Headstrong we were all alone
No one left the same
No more innocence
And we all have helped to break

Yea the killing kind
(Take your hand off the trigger)
Yea the killing kind
(Take your hand off the trigger)
This time is critical
The clock is counting down
Yea the killing kind

Stop talking about a resolution
With the weight of a loaded gun
Keep standing in the noise pollution
And prepare for the war to come

Stay calm is critical
Standing in the firing line alone
With only hell to pay

Yea the killing kind
(Take your hand off the trigger)
Yea the killing kind
(Take your hand off the trigger)
This time is critical
The clock is counting down
Yea the killing kind

We can stand alone in our own disasters
Keep losing hope that we can find the answers
[?] cynical
Calling out for a miracle

Yea the killing kind
(Take your hand off the trigger)
Yea the killing kind
(Take your hand off the trigger)
This time is critical
The clock is counting down
Yea the killing kind
