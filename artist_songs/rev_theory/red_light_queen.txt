Red light, society's whore
Face first right up to a glass door
They keep flying in from somewhere
Green talks if you're looking to score
Five hoe when you get what you came for
They keep showing up from somewhere

We've lost all control here 
We've lost all control here 
We've lost all control

She's got that look in her eyes 
She's got that look in her eyes 
She's got that look in her eyes
Living her life, queen of the night

White strip in the town of the damned
Dark alley need made of the promised land
It keeps pulling me from nowhere

We've lost all control here 
We've lost all control here 
We've lost all control

She's got that look in her eyes 
She's got that look in her eyes 
She's got that look in her eyes
Living her life, queen of the night

Red light queen, red light queen, red light queen
She's got that look in her eyes
Red light queen, red light queen, red light queen
She's got that look in her eyes

We've lost all control here 
We've lost all control here 
We've lost all control

She's got that look in her eyes 
She's got that look in her eyes 
She's got that look in her eyes
Living her life, queen of the night
