So far gone that we can't find our way
Kingdom come and now there's hell to pay
Soldiers swore to save us
Smoking gun don't fail me now
Don't fail me now

Sign the dotted line, don't think about it
Guilty by design, no use, don't fight it

Fame is all a fantasy
Pain is cold reality
I hate all that's surrounding me
This time I can't deny
I need a remedy

Medicated, we are sold the life
Stand your ground and don't be hypnotized
Have we been forsaken?
Constant con by suicide
It's suicide

Sign the dotted line, don't think about it
Guilty by design, no use, don't fight it

Fame is all a fantasy
Pain is cold reality
I hate all that's surrounding me
This time I can't deny
I need a remedy

No time to look back now
Cause we are in it too deep
This drug ain't pulling us down
We're fallin' back to sleep

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Fame is all a fantasy
Pain is cold reality
I hate all that's surrounding me
This time I can't deny
I need a remedy
