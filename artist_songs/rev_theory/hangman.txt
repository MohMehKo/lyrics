Take your places please, you'll need to sit for this one
It's a simple plan with a mangled conclusion
Give us a minute alone
You're gonna follow me down

[CHORUS]
Hangman (You wanna follow me)
How long (Into the bottom we're)
Headstrong (Drink from the bottle)
Until this city tears us both apart

Hang, Man, Hang

Numb your senses please, you won't remember for too long
Sound the Hell alarm and commence the corruption

Give us a minute alone
You're gonna follow me down

[CHORUS x2]

Hang, Man, Hang [x2]

You're gonna follow me
You're gonna follow me down [x4]

Give us a minute alone
You're gonna follow me down

[CHORUS x2]

Hang, Man, Hang [x2]
