Tell me that I’m hopeless
Tell me I’m a lost and wayward son
Tell me that I’m callous
Tell me that our life is too forgone

So take a breath and brace yourself

Tell me I’m a lost soul
Tell me I’ve one foot in the grave
Tell me that I’m shallow
Tell me it’s enough to keep you awake 

So take a breath and brace yourself

[Chorus]
Coz tonight this could be the last chance before we die
Can we rise again from the ashes?
In this final moment
Is the fire still alive?
Tonight

Tell me that I’m faded
Tell me that to you I’m already dead
Tell me that I’m crazy
For thinking that we’d ever be the same again

Tell me that you hate me
It wouldn’t be the worst thing you ever said
But don’t tell me that it’s over
Don’t tell me that it’s over

[Chorus]

We are not the same
This life won’t last forever
We are not the same
Why can’t we just remember?

Scars remind what burned inside, oh

[Chorus]
