I've got this life!
I've got this life, got this feeling inside
I've got this heart!
I've got this heart and it keeps me alive
And there's no resolution without a revolution
Till I find peace inside
Till I find peace inside

Lay down your guns!
Lay down your guns
Lay down, lay down your guns!
Hold onto the faith

I've got this light!
I've got this hate, that is hidden inside
I've got this fight!
I've got this fight it's what keeps me alive
And there's no conversation without a revelation
Till I find peace inside
Till I find peace inside

Lay down your guns!
Lay down your guns
Lay down, lay down your guns!
Lay down your guns
Till I find peace inside
Hold onto the faith

Where did we go
Astray
Where did we go
Astray
Where did we go

Lay down your guns!
Lay down your guns
Lay down, lay down your guns!
Lay down your guns
Till I find peace inside
