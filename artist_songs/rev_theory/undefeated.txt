Never been the one to give in
Never been the one to fail
The enemy is who I'm killing
Keep on fighting tooth and nail
Fight, Fight
I won't back down
Fight, Fight
I won't back down
Fight, Fight
It's you or them now
You or them now, you or them now

Mission completed, I am undefeated
Mission completed, I am undefeated
I'm undefeated

Never been the one to listen
Never been the one to feel
Sanity is what I'm missing
Pray the lord my soul to sell
Fight, Fight
But I won't back down
Fight, Fight
But I won't back down
Fight, Fight
It's you or them now
You or them now, you or them now

Mission completed, I am undefeated
Mission completed, I am undefeated
I am undefeated

Never been the one to give in
Never been the one to fail
Never been the one to give in
It's you or them now
You or them now, you or them now

Mission completed, I am undefeated
Mission completed, I am undefeated
Mission completed, I am undefeated
I am undefeated
