I know you know just what I am
It tears me up and I can't stand
Up on my own, my legs are dead
I cannot mend, it's killing me

I've felt so numb beneath the surface
The walls grow dim and I can't breath
My hands are tied, I cannot feel
I hear it over and over again

It so loud inside my head
These little voices calling me
It so loud inside my head

I left you there without a reason
It took a year to finally see
I felt so numb inside I bleed
And I had so much left to give

It's so loud inside my head
These little voices calling me
It's so loud inside my head
These little voices calling me
It's so loud inside my head

Why can't you let it go?
Can't you let it slid?
Could you let it kill yourself inside?
Why can't you let it go?
Can't you let it slid?
Could you let it kill yourself?

It's so loud inside my head
These little voices calling me
It's so loud inside my head
These little voices calling me
It's so loud inside my head
It's so loud inside my head
