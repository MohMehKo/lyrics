Ten years from now
When I turn around
Will I be satisfied
When I look back on life

Don't tell me it's too late
Don't tell me that I threw it all away
Don't tell me that I did this all in vain

I have my reasons
Why I walk this lonely road
And I never return
Was it worth the life of sacrifice
Ten years from now

When she looks at me (She sees right through me now)
All that emptiness in her eyes
So damn hard to speak (Can't say a word out loud)
There's no words to make this right

She tells me that I'm lost
I know that she will never understand
I know that I will do it all again

I have my reasons
Why I walk this lonely road
If I never return
Was it worth the life of sacrifice
Ten years from now
Years from now...

I have my reasons
Why I walk this lonely road
If I never return
Was it worth the life of sacrifice
Ten years from now
I have my reasons
Why I walk this lonely road (Ten years from now)
And I never return
Was it worth the life of sacrifice
Ten years from now
