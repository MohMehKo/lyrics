Ain’t got nothing to fake
Ain’t got nothing to prove
Another loose cannon
I’m a bad motherfucker
And I ain’t got nothing to lose

I don’t need your hidden agenda
I don’t need you’re trying to sell
All I see is another pretender

Sit back and watch me set the..

[Chorus]
World on fire
Watch him as he burns up the sky
Coz the enemy within
Lives underneath the skin
So set the world on fire

Ain’t got no one to blame
I’m done playing the fool
So light a match to the face and the mirror
Coz its time to face the truth

I don’t need my hidden agenda
I don’t even trust myself
All I see is another pretender

Sit back and watch me set the..

[Chorus]

(I don’t wanna live with my enemy within) [Repeat]

[Chorus x2]

(I don’t wanna live with my enemy within) [Repeat]
