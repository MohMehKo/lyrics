Head down
Walk the line with no opinion
First time
Full collapse, no conversation
Hey now, what are we fighting for?
Hey now, what are we lying for?

Bent back
No belief and no religion
Stone crack
Say goodbye to indecision
Hey now, what are we fighting for?
Hey now, what are we lying for?

We own the night, we burn the light (start)
Feel it come alive
We own the night, we set the fire (start)
Feel it come alive
Deny it, divide it
I'll stand and still defy it
Feed every lie, smash every light
Blow every line, we own the night

Strict line
Feel alive, no inhibitions
Cave in
Lie to breathe, no hesitation
Hey now, what are we fighting for?
Hey now, what are we lying for?

Well dry
Fuel the fight of our addictions
Slow ride
Twist the knife a cold elation
Hey now, what are we fighting for?
Hey now, what are we lying for?

We own the night, we burn the light (start)
Feel it come alive
We own the night, we set the fire (start)
Feel it come alive
Deny it, divide it
I'll stand and still defy it
Feed every lie, smash every light
Blow every line, we own the night

Turn up the audio, lose yourself and all control tonight
I'll keep on clawing my way until there is a change
Caught in the undertow, not alone an animal alive
I'll keep on counting the days until I start again

We own, we own, we own the night

We own the night, we burn the light (start)
Feel it come alive
We own the night, we set the fire (start)
Feel it come alive
Deny it, divide it
I'll stand and still defy it
Feed every lie, smash every light
Blow every line, we own the night

Hey now, what are we fighting for?
Hey now, what are we lying for?

Deny it, divide it
I'll stand and still defy it
Feed every lie, smash every light
Blow every line, we own the night
