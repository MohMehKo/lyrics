I could walk all night 
And never find what's right 
Searching for some peace 
To fill the void in me 
Yeah, yeah 

So was it hard for you to go? 
Did I fail to let you know 
That you are the one I needed most? 
Was is it hard for you to leave 
Without a care for me? 
It takes time to embrace the cold 
Until then I'm just a Hollow Man 

Steel frame in my mind 
Has faded black and white 
All that's left to say 
Fifteen years too late 

So was it hard for you to go? 
Did I fail to let you know 
That you are the one I needed most? 
Was is it hard for you to leave 
Without a care for me? 
It takes time to embrace the cold 
Until then I'm just a Hollow Man 

What have I become? 
The shadow of the sun? 

So was it hard for you to go? 
Did I fail to let you know 
That you were the one I needed most? 
Was is it hard for you to leave 
Without a care for me? 
It takes some time to embrace the cold 
Until then I'm just a Hollow Man
