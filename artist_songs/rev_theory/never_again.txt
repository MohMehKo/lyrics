There’s no escape from my pain
You get no peace of mind
You only twist the knife
And waiting for hell to freeze over
You’re like a gun to my head
I put the fire in hot
Itching to pull the trigger
Over the edge [x3]

Never again
You waste my time
Never again
Invade my life
Never again
You’re no friend of mine
All you do is take my will away

I feel alone in my veins
I’m on the road to dying
Don’t wanna stop to fight it
Counting the lives ‘til it’s over
I met my dark companion
I’m fuckin’ flyin’ high
And now the sun is rising
I’m down in a hole [x3]

Never again
You waste my time
Never again
Invade my life
Never again
You’re no friend of mine
All you do is take my will away
Never again [x5]

Never again
You waste my time
Never again
Invade my life
Never again
You’re no friend of mine
All you do is take my will away [x3]
