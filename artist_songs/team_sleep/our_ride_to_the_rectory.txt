It comes and it kills 
Cruising the earth 
Attacking your towns 
As you watch from outside 
And no one felt crashes in your hearts 

There's another way 
Any other one couldn't stop the fingers from freezing 
Until you're driven half awake 
All you ever want 
Safe inside the covers and freezing 
Alive? 

And no one felt anything at all 
Protecting ourselves 
As you watch from outside 
And everyones thrill 
It crashes in you heart 

There's another way 
Any other one couldn't stop the fingers from freezing 
Until you're driven half awake 
All you ever want 
Safe inside the covers and freezing 
Drove so far away 
No one would ever stop. 
Couldn't tell the difference between them 
And then you struggle under quake 
Hope you never stop 
Hope you never finish breathing 

How does it feel to clip the patient on the wing feather? 
Where does the pain stop and the tearing trough begin, if ever? 
Temperature lockdown, way consumed 
Froze in a block with a blazing view 
Tazing the numbers 
One through two 
Fit in the standard size 
Without
