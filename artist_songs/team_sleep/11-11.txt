Not even fair to box away those old faces 
Not even close to the way it was then 
When everyone would stay away from you 
How everyone would stay away from you 

And I don't remember 
How just the way the water fell down there 
Could make you cry 
Half these embers flew away into the dry brushes 
They were taken by the fire 

That sound drifting off outside 
There's an unlight drizzle going on 

That sound faucets off 
Hang me out the window 
No resolve 
It's all away 

That sound drifting off outside 
There's an unlight drizzle 
Going on 

That sound faucets off 
Hang me out the window 
No resolve 

(that sound drifting off outside 
There's an unlight drizzle going on) 

For every piece of rice that falls Another one falls in your shorts 
Eliminate the stasis burden, eliminate the stasis burden 
If everyone was like lou rawls 
Then no more guys would sing with drawls 

Relax the goods, alright 
Relax the goods, alright 
When everyone would stay away fom you 
When everyone would stay away fom you
