[Intro:]
I I've got loo-o-ve yeah
Woah, woah
I'm God sent
Like everybody else
Woah, woooah

[Chorus:]
I've got love in my heart
And God by my side
There's nothing you can do to hurt me
When the evil try to break my stride
I just call out and I pray to my saviour hey

[Verse 1:]
I'm blessed with talent and health and strength
And dedication that must bring wealth
Been trying so long
Tell failure so long
I'm blessed with my son
Give praise to the lord for all he's done
I'm blessed with family
My people can't you see

[Chorus:]
I've got love in my heart
And God by my side
There's nothing you can do to hurt me
When the evil try to break my stride
I just call out and I pray to my saviour

[Verse 2:]
Good ova evil
I don't fear the devil
I must go to heaven
God make me comfortable
It's on another level
Some try to ignore him
But I do I adore him
He is number one in my life yeah

[Chorus:]
I've got love in my heart
And God by my side
There's nothing you can do to hurt me
When the evil try to break my stride
I just call out and I pray to my saviour

I'm blessed with talent and health and strength
And dedication that must bring wealth
Been trying so long
Tell failure so long

I've got love in my heart
And God by my side
There's nothing you can do to hurt me
When the evil try to break my stride
