[Phone ringing]
[Serani:] Hello
[Raine:] Hi Baby
[Serani:] Hey Baby
[Raine:] It's raining, I want you to come home to me please.

[Raine:]
Baby come home
I got my negligee on and I'm all spread out
No oh oh

[Chorus: x2]
Rain a fall
I gotta leave work
My girl is all alone
She said she just pull off di skirt yeah
What to do
I'm trapped between the two
Should I continue work
Or go attend to my boo

[Verse 1:]
It's like two hill sides and I'm down in the valley on the land
Is where I make my money on the ride
Is where I got my honey
I wanna be rich but I'm needing her body
Here I am in the middle of nowhere
My mind is trapped in mid-air
I don't know what to choose
Too valuable
And none I wanna lose

[Chorus: x2]
Rain a fall
I gotta leave work
My girl is all alone
She said she just pull off di skirt yeah
What to do
I'm trapped between the two
Should I continue work
Or go attend to my boo

[Verse 2:]
These are the two main tings that peak my interest
Money, love, time I invest
From dem I take no recess
Which matters the cheapest
I'm in a state of confusion
I'm trying to find a solution
This is for real
This is no illusion
I ain't never wanna ever have to choose one

[Chorus:]
Rain a fall
I gotta leave work
My girl is all alone
She said she just pull off di skirt yeah
What to do
I'm trapped between the two
Should I continue work
Or go attend to my boo

[Chorus:]
Rain a fall
I gotta leave work
My girl is all alone
She said she just pull off di skirt yeah
What to do
I'm trapped between the two
Should I continue work

[Raine:]
Come on home to me
I need you in my home with me
I'm at the peak of my ecstasy
Won't you fulfil my every fantasy
I'm at home, all alone and it's you I'm needing

[Chorus: x2]
Rain a fall
I gotta leave work
My girl is all alone
She said she just pull off di skirt yeah
What to do
I'm trapped between the two
Should I continue work
Or go attend to my boo
