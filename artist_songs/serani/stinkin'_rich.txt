[Intro:]
I'm gonna be stinkin rich, b*t*h
Making these bad beats, finding these melodies
Haters wanna penny me
But that won't be the end of me

[Chorus:]
I got money in the bank
So my mama don't worry no more... no more
Bad mind, they wanna steal so I never never lef di four four... four four

I got money in the bank
Mama don't worry no more... no more
Bad mind, they wanna steal, I never never lef it oh no... oh no

[Verse 1:]
I got one life to live so I have no regrets nor sorrow
Prepare for tomorrow
Work hard for mine, lead the way cause I will not follow
Cause my brain not shallow
They try to program me to be their shadow
And all they do is make my heart grow hollow
Because I know God is the King, I never worry bout nothing

I'm living a poor mans dream
Investing in housing schemes
No more unsure meals, contract seal
No need to rob and steal

[Chorus:]
I got money in the bank
So my mama don't worry no more... no more
Bad mind, they wanna steal so I never never lef di four four... four four

I got money in the bank
Mama don't worry no more... no more
Bad mind, they wanna steal, I never never lef it oh no... oh no

[Verse 2:]
Money can give and take away happiness
But what's the sense, if all it brings is distress
The more you take home, the more problem
The less you make then, you cyaa solve them
Success brings a lot of fake ass friends
When the money is gone, all the friendships end

I never had a lot of clothes, so many times I had to wash
From the get go... (get go) mama told me never stop
She gave tender care, she was always there
Never let go... (let go) she made me rise to the top
Through the light from the dark, learned a lot from the past
Never suffer no more
Through the light from the dark, learned a lot from the past
Never suffer no more

[Chorus:]
I got money in the bank
So my mama don't worry no more... no more
Bad mind, they wanna steal so I never never lef di four four... four four

I got money in the bank
Mama don't worry no more... no more
Bad mind, they wanna steal, I never never lef it oh no... oh no

[Verse 3:]
Where the f**k would I be without 'name'
Mama, 'name', di real don uncle John
And Stevie, believe mi, it wasn't easy leaving school
They said I have no ambition
Even though we barely knew him, he supported what we doing
A tru I'm, pon anger management do what you doing

While the ones we kept dear to us
They are the most dangerous
They smile with you as if they were your brother
And stab in your back without a dagger
And I could not forget, to mention Elephant
He was so relevant
Yes, oh yes, oh yes
Life took a turn for the best, for the best

[Chorus:]
I got money in the bank
So my mama don't worry no more... no more
Bad mind, they wanna steal so I never never lef di four four... four four

I got money in the bank
Mama don't worry no more... no more
Bad mind, they wanna steal, I never never lef it oh no... oh no

[Bridge:]
I got, I got, I got money in the bank

People, people start act funny when u act funny
Funny, funny how success brings distress

I got, I got, I got money in the bank
I got, I got so many people to thank
People, people start act funny when u act funny

[whispered:]

I got, I got so many people to thank
People, people start act funny when u act funny
Funny, funny how,.. success brings distress. yeah.
