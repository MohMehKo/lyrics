Crop dat cream nigga dat paper I'm tilting the
American dream so when the drama pop off we come with

Motherfuckers! without a question I handle my business
Get rid of the prints I leave no witness, black champ
Hoody black timberland boots(come on)real gully gettin
Money that's how we come do certain things inside the
Grandma house by the stoop, they say don't shit with

Now everybody wanna know who you with and what side
Do you rep man I tell "em like this myself and that's
It yo what's up with the marvin hoe infamous click
I don't know! why don't you get off the infamous dick
Say the money got wronged and your team got switched
Money and chain we still bangin and making them hits
Got the ducks in a row and them things in the clip
Ain't a nigga on this planet dats fucking with this
Now I don't harlem shake or chicken noodle soup but
You can catch me uptown with a pigeon in the coupe
Niggas sitting on the 'plex or chillin on the stoop
If you see me on the corner you know I'm getting dat loot
And I got a dawg with me that's always ready to shoot
If he pull out dat thing he gon' make it do what it do
Never fails you always got some coward getting loose
But you know how shit pop off when sippin on the goose

[CHORUS: x2]
Weed guns and girls and the money so much trouble
With police snitches are no threat to me to me
Weed guns and girls and the money so much trouble
With police snitches are no threat to me to me
