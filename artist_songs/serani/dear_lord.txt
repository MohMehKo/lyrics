[Chorus:]
Dear Lord I love when you make the rain fall
I love when you make the sun shine

Dear lord I love when the flowers dem bloom
I love every single day the sun rise

Dear Lord I love the living things you created
Your greatness is well appreciated

Why me, So why the devil always try to brake it?
And mi no rate it

[Verse 1:]
Dear lord, pray for hypocrite an back biter
We buss shot off a mi head like dem a sniper
Mi naw go down a hell mi a go higher
It a go better inna di high, high, higher
Gimmi di strength fi turn the other cheek
Cause sometime mi feel mi would a buss it
If a fool ever chuck it
Mi naw knock it, mi a lock it, dem lock it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Dear Lord thanks for not giving us more than we can bear
Dear Lord thanks for your son Jesus Christ for mankind to share
Dear Lord thanks for beaches an lotion waters so clear
Dear Lord thanks for giving us heart
Giving us soul

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]

[Chorus x2]
