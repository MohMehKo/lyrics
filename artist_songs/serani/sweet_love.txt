[Intro:]
We don’t talk much at all
When I get home
When the night falls
Even when we’re on the pole
When I see you, when you see me too
One things on my mind, mind, all the time

[Chorus:]
I just wanna make sweet love to you
Lay all night with you
Till the sun come up

I just need you in my arms
My arms, my arms, till the sun come up

Sweet love, sweet love, sweet love, sweet love

[Verse 1:]
In the one lock hrs every day
Your asleep and I at home
When I’m awake you gone away to work
Still we godda find a way to work
Really to make time to bed
We got conflicted hrs
No one know the future am predicting of us
Rather your asleep or awake

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Your my heart, your my air
Your everything to me
Your all I need
Baby girl look in my eyes
Feel my embrace
All I got is all for you
Tonight

[Repeat Chorus 2X]
