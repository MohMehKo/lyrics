[Intro:]
If yuh know yuh love yuh girl
Don't say things that you'll regret
It's Serani, (it's Serani)

[Verse 1:]
Sometime I wish you wouldn't say the shit
That you say to hurt me
Like fuck you
Yuh don't love me anymore
You find another man fu sure
We put our all into this relationship
To flush it down, it's a pit
Fuck that shit
Baby I love you (aahh)

[Chorus:]
Even though I tell you lies
You find it in your heart to forgive me (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Even though I curse at you
You know I don't mean it
I still wish you wouldn't curse me too

[Verse 2:]
Remember girl
Remember the time
The first six months
When everything was perfect
Your heart was mine
Cherish those memories
Cause your worth it
Damn girl but now we fight
You try to provoke me
But I'll never hit you girl
Cause you don't deserve it

[Chorus:]
Even though I tell you lies
You find it in your heart to forgive me (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Even though I curse at you
You know I don't mean it
I still wish you wouldn't curse me too

[Verse 3:]
We cuss den we break up
Then we fuck that's how we make up
Why do we keep doing this shit to each other (aahh)
All I want is to be with you, girl
And I know you want to be with me

[Chorus:]
Even though I tell you lies
You find it in your heart to forgive me (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Even though I curse at you
You know I don't mean it
I still wish you wouldn't curse me too

[Chorus:]
Even though I tell you lies
You find it in your heart to forgive me (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Even though I curse at you
You know I don't mean it
I still wish you wouldn't curse me too

[Outro:]
It's Serani
Remember girl...
