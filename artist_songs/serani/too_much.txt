[Intro:]
Big up Demarco sing fallen soldier
Tired fi mama cry and bawl on shoulda
Must be a Holocaust or Genocide
Humanity I prescribe

[Chorus:]
Too much
Too much gunshot a beat
Too much marrow pon di street
Damn Devil must get defeat
Mama don't like coffin and wreath

The Baddest man don't want him fren get spray
Cause when him kill him have more enemy
How we gonna end dis cycle
Jesus and him twelve disciple

[Verse 1:]
Man a fight fi power
Dem dead by the hour
No rain or fall this is a bloody shower
Trigga happy coward
Could neva be our
Yout and get kill by a trigga happy coward

Buss gun ova land and girl
War for di world
Dead before twenty four
Bombing the land for di earth
Kill man fi di skirt
No life nah worth

[Chorus:]
Too much
Too much gunshot a beat
Too much marrow pon di street
Damn Devil must get defeat
Mama don't like coffin and wreath

The Baddest man don't want him fren get spray
Cause when him kill him have more enemy
How we gonna end dis cycle
Jesus and him twelve disciple

[Verse 2:]
One blood, one love, respect for you and another
Don't kill your brother from another mother
Some other mother could a be yuh mother
Praise God her father
III respect life, respect my wife
I don't need a knife to be stronger
Nooo one man should be blamed
We all should be ashamed
Preserve life longer

[Chorus:]
Too much
Too much gunshot a beat
Too much marrow pon di street
Damn Devil must get defeat
Mama don't like coffin and wreath

The Baddest man don't want him fren get spray
Cause when him kill him have more enemy
How we gonna end dis cycle
Jesus and him twelve disciple
