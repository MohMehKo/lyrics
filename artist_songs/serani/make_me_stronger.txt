Keep breeze to the … he walks by my side
Protect me from evil, evil

Dear lord I pray to you, over and over
Bless me Jehovah, every day
Give me the power to overcome struggle
Make me stronger, stronger
Everybody jump, jump

Because god is love, he rules and reign from above
My heart is clean, my heart is pure
I’m sure I’m worthy of everlong lasting life in heaven
I never come in gun fight to the never operate with the devil
I’m empowered to a higher level, by the all mighty

Dear lord I pray to you, over and over
Bless me Jehovah, every day

Everybody jump, jump

And step on negativity, step from immoral activity
Jump from any devil captivity
Embrace love and sensitivity
Bless kings and city where I live
Bless every ghetto, ever garrison I give
Even when times hard I will, praise the all mighty

Dear lord I pray to you, over and over
Bless me Jehovah, every day
Give me the power to overcome struggle
Make me stronger, stronger, whoa

Praise the lord… praising, praising
These times are so hard, 
Make me stronger, stronger, whoa

Dear lord I pray to you, over and over
Bless me Jehovah, every day
Give me the power to overcome struggle
Make me stronger, stronger [x2]
