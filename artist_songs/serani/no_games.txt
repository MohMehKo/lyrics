Just in case you never know

No gaaaaames... ohhh
You're the only that can out my flame
Baby just play it straight straaaaight
No games... ohhh

[VERSE 1:]
Weve been together 6 months now (The most perfect days)
You pushed for us to exchange vows (Baby changed my ways)
I gave my life over to you
And you turned around
After all that weve been through
I was your rebound

[HOOK:]
Girl I want you (all time)
I'll forever love you (you're mine)
I'm not mad even though I'm sad... (cause you)
Should give me one more chance

[CHORUS:]
Love you girl
Do you feel the same
I doh wanna play... gaaaames
No gaaaaames... ohhh
You're the only that can out my flame
Baby just play it straight straaaaight
No games... ohhh

[VERSE 2:]
Is this the life you really want (constant delusion)
Your time with me was very Fun (there's no illusion)
But I don't know you anymore
When you walked outside that door
You left your happiness

[HOOK:]
Girl I want you (all time)
I'll forever love you (you're mine)
I'm not mad even though I'm sad... (cause you)
Should give me one more chance

[CHORUS: x2]
Love you girl
Do you feel the same
I doh wanna play... gaaaames
No gaaaaames... ohhh
You're the only that can out my flame
Baby just play it straight straaaaight
No games... ohhh
