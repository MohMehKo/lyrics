[Intro:]
Oh girl, I need you
Stay with me
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus:]
She's got control of me,
Hold of my mind an soul for real
I'm her only man, I'm her story plan
So we grow and take it slow
I take pride in my briiiide

[Verse 1:]
She's my one true love
She is my destiny
Whenever times are rough
My baby rescue me
Without her I'm lost,
I'm saying this because
Trust me only she brings out the best in me
Beside every good man there's a good woman
Ever present in my plan she helps with decisions
I'm not afraid to say when she makes my day
No other girl, no other girl makes me feel this way

[Chorus:]
She's got control of me,
Hold of my mind an soul for real
I'm her only man, I'm her story plan
So we grow and take it slow
I take pride in my briiiide

[Verse 2:]
Words can't explain how you make me feel
Oh I'm glad the day that I seal this deal
I know you feel the same and that's why you stay!
And you know I don't wanna play games.

[Chorus:]
She's got control of me,
Hold of my mind an soul for real
I'm her only man, I'm her story plan
So we grow and take it slow
I take pride in my briiiide

[Verse 1:]
She's my one true love
She is my destiny
Whenever times are rough
My baby rescue me
Without her I'm lost,
I'm saying this because
Trust me only she brings out the best in me
Beside every good man there's a good woman
Ever present in my plan she helps with decisions
I'm not afraid to say when she makes my day
No other girl, no other girl makes me feel this way

[Chorus:]
She's got control of me,
Hold of my mind an soul for real
I'm her only man, I'm her story plan
So we grow and take it slow
I take pride in my briiiide

[Chorus:]
She's got control of me,
Hold of my mind an soul for real
I'm her only man, I'm her story plan
So we grow and take it slow
I take pride in my briiiide
