[Intro:]
Empress... be mine (be mine)
Empress... be mine (be mine)
My one and only
Love when she hold me
The things she told me
Please be my...

[Chorus: x2]
Empress
Soley mine
Love at last
Glad she's mine
Give her all my time
One of her kind

[Verse 1:]
She's the perfect one for me
I'm not hunting
She work me, she don't do the bun ting
Caz she's me everything
Let me tell you something
She love me for me
She love me for real
Guardian angel
She's me shield
Let me tell you how I feel...
Damn I'm speechless

[Chorus: x2]
Empress
Soley mine
Love at last
Glad she's mine
Give her all my time
One of her kind

[Verse 2:]
She give me all I want and more
Courteous, heart clean and pure
I must be dreaming
True love revealing
She was born for me
That's why she's drawn to me
Sent from heaven
She's all to me
Beautiful, every man want a touch
But she's my...

[Chorus: x2]
Empress
Soley mine
Love at last
Glad she's mine
Give her all my time
One of her kind

[Bridge:]
Empress... be mine (be mine)
Empress... be mine (be mine)
My one and only
Love when she hold me
The things she told me
Please be my...

[Chorus: x2]
Empress
Soley mine
Love at last
Glad she's mine
Give her all my time
One of her kind
