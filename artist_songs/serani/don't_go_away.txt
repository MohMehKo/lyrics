[Intro:]
Don't get upset
Fall in my arms and hold me
Show me that you love me
Tomorrow as I promise today
Are must go, or love will stay
Don't go away

[Verse 1:]
We each should have a good time
Kick back, relationship is intact
Nothing can get me distract
Tip from you bout info
Argument's have a big impact
Disagreements indeed at times bring sadness

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Girl I love when we are spending quality time
Never ending, positive energy you sending
Respectful not cause you sending
Even when your venty
Your still not disrespecting
Preciated and preventing
Dispute ending, make up sex ending

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Sometimes a hug is worth more than a million words
Fall in mi arms girl, fall in mi arms girl
So in for times approach us
Girl just let history go just
Don't drive on that very road
With a heavy load

[Chorus]
