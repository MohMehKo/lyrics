You want me to tell her how I feel
You wanna know I love her
You wanna hear my voice
You lost my accent

Sing, sing, sing, sing for my lady
Sing, sing, sing, sing for my baby
Sing, sing sweet melodies love
While we creating memories

Sing, sing, sing, sing for my lady
Sing, sing, sing, sing for my baby
Sing, sing sweet melodies love
While we creating memories

[Verse 1:]
