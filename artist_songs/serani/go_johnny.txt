No matter how life tough
Things cyaa rougher
Anything yo waan nuff you must go fa

So help me sing go John
Go Johnny, things could a worst, pressure long

Go Johny, go Johny, go Johny
Nuff have life worst pressure long

[Verse 1:]
Johny deh pn the street him a chad it bay feat
A beg fi bout a week
Not even patty see him cheap
Anything him get, hi tek
Cause him no know when ends fi meet
Mama send him fi dweet, seh him a dweet yo zeet
Things aren't that bad as Johny may think
Infinite the bowo that knowledge may bring
Many don't have the knowledge that the streets bring
So look pon Johny and sing

[Chorus x2]
