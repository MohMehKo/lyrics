[Intro:]
Come back, come back, come back to me
Come back to me baby
Come on home sweet lady

[Chorus:]
Cause I miss you allot
Cause why? Your all I got
Now your gone, gone, goone

Girl I miss you allot
Cause why? Your all I got
Now your gone, gone, goone

[Verse 1:]
It's been about a week since I've herd you speak
I miss you, but the future seems bleak
The best days are gone
Relations speak
My body is weak

Friend sin my click asking for my chick
I got to respond with something slick
Who I got to fix this
Who I got to fix things quick

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
They say we shouldn't be together
But I know better
Cause everyday my eyes get wider
Now from the weather
I wrote this one just like a letter
I got to tell you
Cause I called her cellular and never get her
I want you allot
That's why am giving you all I got
They say we have nothing to relate to
And how I shouldn't date you
Girl I got to say too that I

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I've been looking on my phone
Waiting on the ring tone
You reach the voicemail of no ones home
Dying inside going crazy all alone
Your everything I need girl
Your my own
What can I do to have you by my side again
Your my lover girl, your my best friend
And only you can save me
I've been thinking bout my last lady

[Chorus]
