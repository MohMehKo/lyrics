[Verse 1:]
Girl put your hands where yo know it land
Why is the love on the stand
Grind paw mi body to the sand
This feeling can't done
Cause I never get a cat fat like this
Yo never get another back shot like this
Mi a get a lollypop candy kiss
I cat like that I can't resist

[Chorus:]
Wine in a slow motion
Mi meck yo wetter than the ocean
You feel mi a squeeze it yeah
Do anything fi keep it

Girl wine in a slow motion
Mi meck yo wetter than the ocean
A fi mi, mi a seized it
Do anything fi keep it

[Verse 2:]
Take out yo love bout ankle
A fi yo suh a yuh fi just conker
Shock mi wid yo big long tangle
A real man mi want, no want no bankle
A never ride a bigger black bike than this
Fling mi meck mi giggle, meck mi turn and twist
A me invent the lollypop candy kiss
Bet yo seh none sweet yo like this

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Bum paw mi cockey likkle longer
How mi go suh hard yuh a wonder
Just baba roots weh mi under
Yuh a meck mi stand stronger
No rain cloud never get wetter than this
Yo never si a flute blow better than this
Every time a you deh yah mi never go dis
Yo cyaa dweet yo get dismiss

[Chorus x2]
