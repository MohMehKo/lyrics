[Intro & chorus:]
My mama she don't worry no more, they try to build me up, they can't
Take me down(let's settle), in this time and in this city I gotta make
That money because di mama still hungry, mama still hungry, I'm gonna
Be a dad it ain't no baby, take care of my baby, mama mama still hungry
Mama still hungry

[Verse 1:]
I was in the band when I faced my real struggle
Made friends watch me sank in a deep fortune cut down yuh buying
And me see dem from inside, me try to keep it down prolong my ride
I got a little success and they start this money grabbing say where
We come from and what they should be having, cunning and sly ignore
Their own pride, they leave you dry before you fly

[Chorus:]
But it's my destiny
To use my god made destiny, to fulfill my chorus, for us, no sake of
Health keep mi focus, for these times in this city, gotta make that
Money, bacause di mama still hungry, mama still hungry, I'm gonna be
A dad it ain't no baby, take care of my baby, mama still hungry, mama
Still hungry

[Verse 2:]
Complacency is adjacent, to vagrancy, presently, no latency, no
Limit pass the sky just vacancy, mama feel the pain but she always
Vary, sometimes I even wish she could carry, but it's time to relieve
This stress my mama deserve the best

[Outro:]
But it's my destiny to use my
God made destiny, to fulfill my chorus, for us, no sake of health keep
Mi focus, for this time in this city gotta make that money, because
Di mama still hungry, mama still hungry, I'm gonna be a dad it ain't
No baby, take care of my baby, mama still hungry, mama still hungry
Don't try to build me up, don't try to break me down, mama don't worry
No more
