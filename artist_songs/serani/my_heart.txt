[Chorus:]
If I gave you my heart
Would you take it?
If I give you my heart would you break it

What would you do if I say I love you?
What would you do if I said I need you?
If I gave you my heart would you care it

[Verse 1:]
Would you be a ride or die true?
Would you be there when I need you?
Reach my side quick
Would you, would you be there whenever am sick?
When all the money gone through tin, thick
Would you be there when no one want's to be around?
When all friends pack up and gone
Would you be the only one, the only one?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Would you defend mi to the last breath?
Would you love mi till wi part from the cause of death?
Would you support mi when mi have death?
Would you go through every cry, every tear, every sweat?
Do you have unconditional love for me?
Do you think your the one for me?
Would you do anything, anything, anything, on this earth for me

[Chorus x3]
