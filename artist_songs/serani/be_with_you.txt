Baby when we met you said don't every hide my feelings
Gave me respect and honesty
We had no secrets
Did everything together

Cause you're my treasure
Baby you and me forever

In relationships you gotta have trust
Compromise that's trust
What it takes to make us compatible
You don't ever need attitude
Whatever it is we can work it out
Listen please let's talk it out
Girlfriend, you're mine till the end of time

I can't help but feel this way (this way)
Cause you're my treasure
Baby you and me forever

[Verse 3:]
I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad
When I made my discovery
I'll never be sad when my baby's with me
Cause I'm sure
Of my love
For you baby
This is real, giiiirrrl
I just gotta say
I can't help but feel this way
But you're my treasure
Baby you and me forever

[Chorus:]

I wanna be with you
It's true I wanna be with you
Oh girl it's true

In sun or rain or snow or sleet
It's true I wanna be with you, girl
