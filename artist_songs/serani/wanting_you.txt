It's it's it's serani
This one is for the ladies
Serani's babies
Babygirl

[Verse 1:]
Nothing that I want from you
Almost anything I would do
I'll never be untrue
So just give it up give it up baby girl

[Chorus:]
I been wanting you from the first day
Daydreaming of you makes me hallucinate
Girl I want your body
I'm willing to meet your mommy
You've got the remedy to make me feel so great

[Verse 2:]
I won't stress her ready to undress her
Alliviate her pain make her better and better
More or lesser anything she prefer
She like when I turn around
And make it wetter
She knows that I got it
I made it my habbit
To make her dance and sing like janet
I won't top it for dinner light topics
So babygirl

[Chorus:]
I been wanting you from the first day
Daydreaming of you makes me hallucinate
Girl I want your body
I'm willing to meet your mommy
You've got the remedyto make me feel so great

[Verse 3:]
When I'm around I make u blush
And take your time there's no need to rush
Hear your friend's saying such and such
That I'm not the one to make your life
