[Intro:]
It's either now or never
I gotta make my move
I gotta make my life improve
Daseca production
And there ain't no otha
Craig David and Bugle a mi bredda
We gotta make it
In these times
Yeah...

[Chorus:]
It's so hard
Bussing my brain everyday
I'm just trying to get paid
But I hate my job
Cause I can't get no raise
I can't save a dolla
Still I gotta buckle my colla
Gotta take care of my mama
Working is 9 to 5
Cause all I'm trying to do is stay alive

[Verse 1:]
Excuse me mister manager
Can I get this promotion
Cost of living is so damn hard
My papa is broke and so am I
God turn this sorrow off
You people drive the biggest Benz
And live in Beverly Hills
And have the richest ends
Your neighbours are your politician freinds
Please end this corruption
When will it end
Cause...

[Chorus:]
It's so hard
Bussing my brain everyday
I'm just trying to get paid
But I hate my job
Cause I can't get no raise
I can't save a dolla
Still I gotta buckle my colla
Gotta take care of my mama
Working is 9 to 5
Cause all I'm trying to do is stay alive

[Verse 2:]
Chasing hard times
My game I gotta step it up
Bow hard gotta get my work ethics up
Working over time
Money over crime
Gotta go for mine
I got a baby on the way
Gotta paint the way for him
So there's no time to play
Cause I'm responsilble
For the future of my people

[Chorus:]
It's so hard
Bussing my brain everyday
I'm just trying to get paid
But I hate my job
Cause I can't get no raise
I can't save a dolla
Still I gotta buckle my colla
Gotta take care of my mama
Working is 9 to 5
Cause all I'm trying to do is stay alive

[Verse 3:]
I can't quit my job
Cause there's no guarantee
I'll get a better one (get a better one)
No one's hiring
But everyone's firing
Damn this work is tiring
Got to go on and on
And face another day

[Chorus:]
It's so hard
Bussing my brain everyday
I'm just trying to get paid
But I hate my job
Cause I can't get no raise
I can't save a dolla
Still I gotta buckle my colla
Gotta take care of my mama
Working is 9 to 5
Cause all I'm trying to do is stay alive
