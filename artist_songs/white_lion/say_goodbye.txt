I stand before the ocean
And watch the sun go down
I think about tomorrow
When I must leave my home
Tonight will last forever
As we say goodbye
Cause tomorrow they will take away my life
So look at me for the last time
Before I die
I will never see my home again
No never never never...

Say goodbye
Say goodbye
When you leave your home for the last time
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Cause your all alone for the first time

The night is getting colder
And time is drawing near
If only I was older
I could not feel the fear
But in this final hour
Before I die
As I call your name
I would cry the last goodbye
So look at me and remember me
The way I used to be
I will never see your face again.
No never never never...

Say goodbye
Say goodbye
When you leave your home for the last time
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Cause your all alone for the first time
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
When you leave your home for the last time
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Now you're on your own for the first time
