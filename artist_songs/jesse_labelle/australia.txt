Five months and counting, Its been a while,
its been a long time coming around. 
No board for sounding this time around, 
coming back down.

I thought I knew just what I wanted out of this,
I haven't seen her face in ages, haven't heard her 
since she said,

That I'm going to Australia cause I'm already down below, 
maybe I can learn to swim against this undertow.
She said I'm leaving in the morning, because I need a little change,
And now she's riding on a wave thats bringing her back around this way.

Five oaths and counting, its been a while,
its been a long time since I've made this sound.
In five days she'll make it back around,
shes coming back down.

I'm not quite sure of where I'll find myself in this, 
haven't felt this way in ages, I haven't seen her since she said,

That I'm going to Australia cause I'm already down below, 
maybe I can learn to swim against this undertow.
She said I'm leaving in the morning, because I need a little change,
and now shes riding on a wave thats bringing her back around this way.

She don't know that I haven't changed,
No She don't know, cause she's too far away.
She don't know that I haven't changed, 
She don't know, no

She said I'm going to Australia cause I'm already down below,
maybe I can learn to swim against this undertow.
She said I'm leaving in the morning, because I need a little change,
and now she's riding on a wave thats bringing her back around this way.

She said I'm going, oh I'm going
oh, I'm going, and I...
She said I'm going, I'm going,
I'm going...

And she don't know
