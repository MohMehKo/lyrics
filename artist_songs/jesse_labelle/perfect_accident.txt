Walking through a red light
Staring at the ground, I fell for you
You caught me with my guard down
But I felt safe and sound right there with you
And my heart was wide open
And as I crashed into you I learned that

Some signs are made, while some are sent to me
You're just a perfect accident
Could not have planned or understand
But you were just the perfect accident

Walking under ladders
It doesn't really matter anymore
With all the luck in this world
I finally found what I've been looking for
And now my eyes are wide open
When I'm looking at you I know that

Some signs are made, while some are sent to me
You're just a perfect accident
Could not have planned or understand
But you were just the perfect accident

Oh the more I try
Yet the less I find
With a little time
Good things come to those who wait
My heart was wide open
And as I crashed into you I learned that

Some signs are made, while some are sent to me
You're just a perfect accident
Could not have planned or understand
But you were just the perfect accident

Oh to me you're just a perfect accident
Oh you were just a perfect accident
