I wanna tell them the truth
A way to get through to you
I wanna say it so they don’t forget it
Give you something you can hold on to

I’m caught in the center of the storm
A thousand pages lying on the floor

I've been looking for the magic words
Something better than you've ever heard
Show you something that you've never seen
Give you all my honesty
Let you know what I feel inside
Find a way to set your heart on fire
And I know when I get it right
I'm gonna tell you again and again and again

Gotta get it off my mind
And I don't wanna waste your time
And I gotta get it down before it's vanished
'Cause something good is so hard to find

I've been looking for the magic words
Something better than you've ever heard
Show you something that you've never seen
Give you all my honesty
Let you know what I feel inside
Find a way to set your heart on fire
And I know when I get it right
I'm gonna tell you again and again and again

I'm caught in the center of the storm
A thousand pages lying on the floor

I've been looking for the magic words
Something better than you've ever heard
Show you something that you've never seen
Give you all my honesty
Let you know what I feel inside
Find a way to set your heart on fire
And I know when I get it right
I'm gonna tell you again and again and again

I've been looking for the magic words
Something better than you've ever heard

I'm gonna tell you again and again and again
