It's just another lonely night
They happen all the time
Now that you're not around.
Like picking up a loaded gun
Holding the telephone
And I should put it down.

Watching you walk away
Even though I know I never should have let you out of sight
I play the game even though I go up in flames and I'm burning down tonight.
You keep from me, but I'm drowning and slowly sinking in a bottle of Patr√≥n.
I can't let go-oh oooooh I can't let go, so

It's just another lonely night
They happen all the time
Now that you're not around.
Like picking up a loaded gun
Holding the telephone
And I should put it down.
It's just another wasted call full of alcohol,
Another night I know that I won't recall,
And it's never enough, it's another heartbreak coverup.

It's there beneath all the shattered, broken pieces I've been trying to let go-oh.
Hiding away in the places to see distant faces of the love you used to know, oh.
To keep from me and I'm spinning, I feel like dying, I got one foot on the floor
I can't let go-oh, oooooh I can't let go, so

It's just another lonely night
They happen all the time
Now that you're not around.
Like picking up a loaded gun
Holding the telephone
And I should put it down.
It's just another wasted call full of alcohol,
Another night I know that I won't recall,
And it's never enough, it's another heartbreak coverup.

It's another heartache, mistake, waiting for the rain after the knife
Cause crying won't be enough to wash the blood after the fight,
You see the pain I'm feeling,
It isn't less, than the moment till I get you mine I'm still standing until I call the fight.

It's just another lonely night
They happen all the time
Now that you're not around.
Like picking up a loaded gun
Holding the telephone
And I should put it down.
It's just another wasted call full of alcohol,
Another night I know that I won't recall,
And it's never enough, it's another heartbreak coverup.

It's just another wasted call full of alcohol,
Another night I know that I won't recall,
And it's never enough, it's another heartbreak coverup.
