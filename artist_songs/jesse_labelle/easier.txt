My beautiful love I’m sorry
You can't find your way
My beautiful love I’ll tell you, everything’s okay 
When you need a room to settle in 
And nobody wants to let you in
When are your doubts are wondering
About the life your living in

Let it all come down on me
I only want to make it easier
Let it all fall down on me
I only want to make it easier 

My beautiful love don't say it
Give yourself some time
My beautiful one don't tell me
You might never shy

When all of your feels are coming true
And nobody is looking out for you
The things you never wanted to
Starting to get the best of you

Let it all come down on me
I only want to make it easier
Let it all fall down on me
I only want to make it easier 

When I was lost
With so many thoughts
You came around, all alone
You are the one
Who took what was wrong 
And turned it around

Let it all come down on me
I only want to make it easier
Let it all come down on me
I only want to make it easier 

Let it all come down on me
I only want to make it easier 
Let it all come down on me
I only want to make it easier 

Let me try
Let me try
Let me try
Let me try
Make it easier
To make it easier
