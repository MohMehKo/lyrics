She stopped smiling at me, I asked her what was wrong.
And she said don't you know the way this goes? 
She took my hand and I could see I had to hold it tight
cause I knew she was about to leave. 
she said she couldn't tell me why, but she knew she had to go
and as I hung on for my life she said,

I'm lost without you
and I can't breathe without you,
and I can't love without you,
but I'm leaving you now.
She said she's cold and jaded,
and she's tired and faded
so lost without your love.

New direction carry me
far away from that familiar face
that I just can't bear to see
You're moving on so easily
sleeping next to a new lover
Sharing your dreams with another
So I went to the place where you would be
and I felt my body crashing
So I got down on my knees and I said,

I'm lost without you
and I can't breathe without you,
and I can't love without you,
If your leaving me now,
you leave me cold and jaded
Leave me tired and faded,
so lost without your love.

Oh, but She's taking off
and her bags are in her hands.
She says she's thinking about a place to lay her
mind down by the sand.
Just a little more time to live a life thats all her own.
As she turns to leave she says "Babe, I've gotta go,
I'm only lost cause your the only thing I know"

She said I'm lost without you,
and I can't breathe without you,
and I can't love without you, 
But I'm leaving you now.
She said she's cold and jaded,
leave me tired and faded,
So lost without your love, 
lost without your love.
