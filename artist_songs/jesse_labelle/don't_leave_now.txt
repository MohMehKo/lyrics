[Verse 1]
Gone but you're still out here
Where you've been is unclear
The days have been lonely 
Am I the only one, my dear...

Inside the house we've built
Youâ€™re here against your will 
That's our only purpose
Just scratch the surface and stand still

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna run to the place where you hide
And tell you with all my life please

[Chorus]
Please don't leave now.. I am not ready
You can take my heart but
don't leave now... it's too unsteady
I'm not ready
To watch you go...

[Verse 2]
Somewhere inside your heart
Must be a brand new start
I think you're confided, please let me steal it, for just one day

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna run to the place where you hide
And tell you with all my life

[Chorus]
Please don't leave now.. I am not ready
You can take my heart but
don't leave now... it's too unsteady
I'm not ready
To watch you go...
