What would you do
Could you tell me if you knew
That you'd never get to see me again
Would you look me in the eye
While we're runnin' out of time
And say you just wanna be friends
Well that's indeed with what chu' know
That I believe in that the world is very soon gonna end
And you know the clock is tickin'
I don't wanna spend it talkin'
Now I'm chalkin' up I should be your man

I'll be the one holding on until it's done girl
Before we all Perish, I'm takin' you to Paris
And if the stars fell down, 
You wouldn't miss them, I could move 'em 
Paint a picture like I'm Vincent
If the ground caved in there's no denyin' 
We'll be flyin' round the world tonight
You can call me over right now
Let's see, we'll turn the moment to eternity
Oh if the Mayans are right
At least we'll have one last night
One last night

If the world is gonna end
Tell me where do we begin
Cuz we only gotta matter of time
For what it's worth 
Before we're walkin' off the earth
Before we jet I'm gonna make you mine

I'll be the one holding on until we're done girl
And when it's the rapture I'll be your ever after
And if the stars fell down, 
You wouldn't miss them, I could move 'em 
Paint a picture like I'm Vincent
If the ground caved in
There's no denying
We'll be flyin' around the world tonight
You can call me over right now

Let's see
We'll turn the moment to eternity
Oh if the Mayans are right
At least we'll have one last night
One last night

[Nixon:]
Girl we can get a drink and get to sippin' it slow
But tomorrow isn't promised
That's the difference you know
So if the Earth got to rockin'
And the planet was doomed
Would you ride upon my rocket 
And get off on the moon
(What)
And if the world ends by a meteor right
You could bring your girlfriend
Then we'll make it our night
Tell her it's alright
Let's get into some trouble
Drive a double double
I'ma keep you up all night

And if the stars fell down, 
You wouldn't miss them, I could move 'em 
Paint a picture like I'm Vincent
If the ground caved in
There's no denyin'
We'll be flyin' around the world tonight
You can call me over right now
Let's see
We'll turn the moment to eternity
Oh if the Mayans are right
At least we'll have one last night
One last night

One last night

One last night
