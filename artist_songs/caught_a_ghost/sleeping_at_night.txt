When you smile it's like you're waiting for something 
To spring from the back of your mind, 
When you speak it's like you're searching for nothing,
Nothing comes quicker than nothing you'll find 

You're the kind of emotionless creature, 
Bites at heels of the needless seekers 
Mouth moves along with the meaningless speaker, 
Swinging your fist, getting weaker and weaker 

[Chorus:]
I hope you make it alright 
I hope you make it alright 
Make your mind up, you get right up 
And march to the mouth of the meaningless line up 
I hope we make it alright 
I hope we make it alright 
You can sell dust and steal the day light, 
For all that I care just as long as you're sleeping at night. 

Kindly tell me what you'd like me to say,
I will say it for you and get out of your way.
Settle down 'cause you're starting to scare us
Looks like you're carelessly wasting away.

Cashing in on what you're believing,
Trying to get up on the moveable feasting,
Mirrors in the morning you're becoming a beast
Making those ends keeps you moving at least. 

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
