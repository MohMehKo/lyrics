You can tell me all about your made up friends
You can complain about your boring job
You can fight, I will make amends
Try to shake me, but I won't gonna stop!
I found out what you wanted to know
It's no doubt, she's the one I was made for
Is no use trying to hang me up
I'm bound to do what I came here to do!

[Chorus:]
You can wear your heart out,
Or you can wear your heart out on your sleeve
You can try to hold out
Or you can try to hold out your hands with me!
Your hands with me!

You can pretend that you're not at home,
Burn my money up and crash my car.
You can steal all my best clothes,
Try to flee, but I'm quicker by far
Find out that is not worth the flame
It's no doubt that I'm better than no one!
It's no use trying to shut me up
I can holler till my face is blue!

[Chorus:]
You can wear your heart out,
Or you can wear your heart out on your sleeve
You can try to hold out
Or you can try to hold out your hands with me!
Your hands with me!
Hold out your hands with me!
