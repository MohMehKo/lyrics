Well you were right on time
You were mine all mine
For a little while
But shit gets complicated
I get aggravated
And I don't know why

I drink too much
I lose my touch
And I lock myself away
But your big brown eyes
Keep me hypnotized
Please say that you're here to stay

Oh you are the one
That makes me believe in myself
Oh you are the one
And for me there is nobody else, yeah
Because I believe in you
Because I believe in you
Because I believe in you
Because I believe in you

Sometimes I'm weak
You know I'm kind of a freak
Baby I realize
And you are a gentle soul
Always in control
You keep my heart between your thighs

When I stay home alone
I'm either sad or I'm stoned
Wishing I could see your face
I'm addicted to you
I'm praying that you
Will come home and give me a taste

Because you are the one
That makes me believe in myself, yeah
You are the one
And for me there is nobody else
Because I believe in you, yeah
Because I believe in you
Because I believe in you
Because I believe in you

Staying up and sleeping in
Digging hole I'm sinking in
Calling you late at night
I only wanna hold you but
I'm stuck in California
The weather is nice
But it never feels right

Because you are the one
That makes me believe in myself
Oh you are the one
And for me there is nobody else
Because I believe in you
Because I believe in you
Because I believe in you, hahaha yeah
Because I believe in you
