Get your life, get your life, get your life
Get your life, get your life, get your life
Get your life, get your life, get your life
Get your life, get your life, get your life

Always been the only one I know
Get around never let it show
But you can see it in their eyes
Some people will surprise ya

Who I am I have never been
Always seen what I've never seen
And I didn't realize
That you'll always compromise

Some people cant get with it
Sit around just talking shit
Sometimes you look at yourself 
And wonder why you put up with it
Get yourself out of bed
Get off the internet
Get out and shake some hands
It's time to make some brand new friends

Get your life, get your life, get your life
Get your life, get your life, get your life
Get your life, get your life, get your life
Get your life, get your life, get your life
Get your life, get your life, get your life
Get your life, get your life, get your life
Get your life, get your life, get your life
Get your life, get your life, get your life

Never know how to play the game
I get right to it say the wrong thing
But I figure in the end
None of us is standing

Who we are we will always be
Never knowing when our day will be
And we can't immortalize
Might as well call it a type

Some people just won't admit
Can't see it like it is
Sometimes it's just to short 
To tell we're all so different

Get yourself out of your head
Nevermind what your friend said
Go out and fly your flag 
And maybe make someone smile with it

Get your life, get your life, get your life
Get your life, get your life, get your life
Get your life, get your life, get your life
Get your life, get your life, get your life
Get your life, get your life, get your life
Get your life, get your life, get your life
Get your life, get your life, get your life
Get your life, get your life, get your life

Get your life, get your life
Get your life, get your life
Get your life, get your life
Get your life, get your life
