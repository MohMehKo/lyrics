You can't come in trying to make your peace
With a knife behind your back
If you can't throw yourself down on your knees
You look like you're on the attack

Are you waiting for an invitation or
Just trying to knock yourself off track
Go on home, draw your curtains, love
Paint your bedroom black

Because there's nothing for you here
There's nothing for you here

They say you're looking for a one track mind
I hope that you find it
Even if it exists as you say
You won't recognize it
Satisfaction comes and it goes again
In all shapes and sizes
You say you're looking for a fight, my friend
I dare you to try it

Because there's nothing for you here
'Cause there's nothing for you here

Give it a rest, love
Unless you want to
Kick and scream and shout
Give me your best, love
If you want to
At least try to freak me out

Well I see you out in town making friends
Is that what you call it?
Try to slow down before you reach the end
But you barely could stall it
You're choking around the same old fun
Doesn't it get boring?
You can spin it backwards or upside down
It's still the same old story
