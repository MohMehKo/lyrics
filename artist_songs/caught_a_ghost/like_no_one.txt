Well you got what I need
You're the saint to my sins
You've got a timely soul 
That I could live within
You're an apple on my lips
I'm a beast about to fall
Down your endless bout of pleasure
I'm just waiting on the call

I can love you like no one
I can give you what you need
I can wait down underwater
For permission to breathe (mmmm)

I've been took for all my money
I've got nothing but time
My condition's my ambition
To pursue and make you mine
I want nothing but your company
I will bring gifts to your door
You can lie with me forever
While we settle up the score

I can love you like no one
I can give you what you need
I can wait down underwater
For permission to breathe
I can love you like no one
I've got aces in my sleeve
I will make you break your silence
I can make believe

I see you moving in the dark
I can come and collect you
We can break in to the park
Love me if you want to
Leave me if you must
You can keep moving and shaking
I'm just shaking off the dust

From your heart that's been locked up
In the freezer where you lay
I can keep it real quiet
If you just come out to play
All the days will be pointless
We can un-write all the rules
I will fail to disappoint you
You will lose at playing cool

I can love you like no one
I can give you what you need
I can wait down underwater
For permission to breathe
I can love you like no one
You will never feel alone
I can make you break your silence
I will upturn every stone
