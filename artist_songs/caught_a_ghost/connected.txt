We're together even when we're part 
I'm connected to your voice floating to my heart
All in the distance, I see you up somewhere 
I'm heading in your direction 
I'll meet you halfway yeah 

You're the one that I'm tryin' to reach 
get on to you 
'cause you got holding me yeah. 
You got me holding me darling.

If you forget me baby, I'll remind you,
when you're far away I'm beside you, 
put your hand down, you can heal me? 
reach out and touch me, can you feel me?
Mhmm. 
Reach out and touch me!
Reach out and touch me!

You and me from a different place 
a thousand miles away I see your face
time isn't wasting you, I need you here and now 
I got to keep on chasing and get to you somehow 

You're the one that I see in my sleep 
My heart on you you just don't let go me. 
Don't let go to me darling. 

If you forget me baby, I'll remind you,
when you're far away I'm beside you, 
put your hand down, you can heal me? 
reach out and touch me, can you feel me?
Mhmm. 
Reach out and touch me!
Reach out and touch me!

I've been waiting right here for you 
All the thing that I'm trying to do 
Hold tight 'cause I'm coming through 
I'll find a way 
Yeah yeah 

If you forget me baby, I'll remind you,
when you're far away I'm beside you, 
put your hand down, you can heal me? 
reach out and touch me, can you feel me?
Mhmm. 
Reach out and touch me!
Reach out and touch me!
