Don't want no sugar in my coffee
It makes me mean, Lord, it makes me mean
(I don't want no)

Well you can trace
Lines in your face
But it's the weight of your spirit makes you old
Though you hate
To see it go
This old world's just put pennies on your floor

And all I've seen
And all you've done
All it means
We'll be sorry when you're gone

Hold
Your hands up high
My love, I'll see
You by and by

Hold
Your hands up high
My love, I'll see
You by and by

Don't want no sugar in my coffee
It makes me mean, Lord, it makes me mean
(I don't want no)

I may not know
What happens now
I see some old posing cracks in to your ground
If I could fall
Into your arms,
Sweet love, it means, I swear I did no harm

And all I've seen
And all I've done
All it means
I'll be sorry when you're gone

Hold
Your hands up high
My love, I'll see
You by and by

Hold
Your hands up high
My love, I'll see
You by and by

Hold
Your hands up high
My love, I'll see
You by and by
(I don't want, I don't want)

(Bye bye)
(Bye, bye)

Hold
Your hands up high
My love, I'll see
You by and by

Hold
Your hands up high
My love, I'll see
You by and by
(I don't want no sugar in my coffee
It makes me mean, Lord, it makes me mean)
