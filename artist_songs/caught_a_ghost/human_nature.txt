I can see the darkness closing in, see the blackness on the horizon
Never you mind it, never you mind it
I can see the smoke rings in the sky, I can feel the water rising
Never you mind it, never you mind it
Streets are paved with empty words, signs of life all obscured
Where do you find it, where do you find it?
You see the lives you could've lived, what you take and what you give
It's all in the timing, it's all in the timing

Getting money, getting love, getting fed, getting fucked up
Human nature, it's human nature
Getting money, getting love, getting fed, getting fucked up
Human nature, it's human nature

(Getting money, getting love, getting fucked up)

It's a struggle every day if you chase yourself away
What are you hiding, what are you hiding?
You've got a love that will not fade, there is no end to what you'll change
How do you like it, how do you like it?
You are the source of all you seek, but it gets hard to believe
How do you fight it, how do you fight it?
You don't look back only ahead, running circles with your friends
Every night yeah, every night yeah

Getting money, getting love, getting fed, getting fucked up
Human nature, it's human nature
Getting money, getting love, getting fed, getting fucked up
Human nature, it's human nature

(It's human nature)

Getting money, getting love, getting fed, getting fucked up
Human nature, it's human nature
Get in trouble, run around, settle down, getting knocked up
Human nature, it's human nature

Getting money, getting love, getting fed, getting fucked up
Human nature, it's human nature
Get in trouble, run around, settle down, getting knocked up
Human nature, it's human nature

Taking drugs, fuck around, getting locked up
Fall in love, settle down, getting knocked up
Getting money, getting love, getting fed, getting fucked up
Human nature
