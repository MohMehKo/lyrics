Corn sugar and caffeine
I feel my body in two different places
Still playing for both teams
Sometimes it feels I was born with two faces

I feel the smoke climbing up my cheeks
I hear the jokes and I smell the punchlines
I lay broken in my bed for weeks
My room's too dark and my bed's on the faultline

I got a feeling that I can't let go
I got a feeling that I can't let go
I got a feeling that I can't let go
I got a feeling that I can't let go
I got a feeling that I can't let go
I got a feeling that I can't let go
I got a feeling that I can't let go
Can't let go

Sing a song about heartbreak
What do you know about the sweet taste of sadness?
I got a name for each one of my headaches
What do you know about the thin line to madness?

I need a new part with new lines
Anything if it's good for your head
You can donate your heart to science
But it won't bring you back from the dead

I got a feeling that I can't let go
I got a feeling that I can't let go
I got a feeling that I can't let go
I got a feeling that I can't let go
I got a feeling that I can't let go
I got a feeling that I can't let go
I got a feeling that I can't let go
Can't let go

You'll find the sweetness
You'll find the sweetness
Like me
Sweetness
Like me
