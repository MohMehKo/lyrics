Sometimes I’m so high 
That I just float 
I can’t even think about 
All the darkness ahead 
Sometimes I’m so low 
And I don’t know why 
I just can’t wait 
For the masquerade to end

But my problem, just the same 
As every man, woman and child 
That every good thing must come to an end 
Move on somehow 

When my sadness settles in 
I can’t help thinking 
That I’m wasting my time 
But my joy comes and rains right down 
In the strangest hours, in the dead of the night 
All of my anger, and my jealous woe dissipates 
And my loving rejoice 
And every new day, brings new ideas 
But in the back of my mind, is an ominous voice 

But my problem, just the same 
As every man, woman and child 
That every good thing must come to an end 
Move on somehow 

Sometimes I’m so high 
That I just float 
I can’t even think about 
All the darkness ahead 
Sometimes I’m so low 
And I don’t know why 
I just can’t wait 
For the masquerade to end 

I know there is something waiting 
On the other side, but for now
It seems every good thing must come to an end 
Move on somehow 
Every good thing must come to an end 
Move on somehow.
