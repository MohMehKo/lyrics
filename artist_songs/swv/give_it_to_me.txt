[Verse 1:]
I'm a type of girl with class 
But, you never know what you can get 
'Till you go and ask for it 
I was shy, but now I finally see 
All you have to do is (just ask) 
For anything you want 
(It's yours) you get right to the point 
(If love) is what you really need, don't be shy 
Just say, &quot;Boy, give it to me...right now&quot; 

[Chorus:]
Give, give, give it to me, baby (baby) 
Boy, I need you right now 
Give, give, give it to me, honey (honey) 
Give, give, give it to me, baby 
Give it to me 
Give it to me 

[Verse 2:]
You feel real good deep inside my (whole life) 
You're rubbing me inside me body 
Take me on a natural high 
You love me the way I want you to 
And you know I like it 
(I like) it when you touch my face 
(Love me) Oh, in a private place 
(You know) you're all I really need 
Don't be shy with me (don't be shy) 
Give it to me 

[Chorus]

[Rap:] 
I'll give to you babe, 'cause I know you need it 
And if you really want it 
You'll be there to receive it 
Believe it, when I say you need it like attention 
Well let me kick it 
What I mean, is let me mention 
The fact's not the fiction 
It's sorta like addiction 
But there's one thing missing 
And there is no prescription 
From me, the maestro, direct to SWV 
And I'll give it to you 
Or you can give it to me 

(I like) it when you touch my face 
(Love me) Oh, in a private place 
(You know) you're all I really need 
Don't be shy with me (don't be shy) 
Give it to me 

[Chorus x2]

I need L-O-V-E 
Boy, you know just what I need 
In the morning when I wake 
You will see my smiling face 
Come on, give me that sweet love 
You're the one I'm dreaming of 
You're the one I really need 
Give it to me! 

[Chorus: Until Fade]
