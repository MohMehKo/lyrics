[CHORUS]
What's it gonna be?
Is it gonna be you
And me?
What's it gonna be?
Is it gonna be you-ooh
And me? Babe...

Wasn't it you
Who said
We'd be together always?
I think I've been 
Miislead
It took a while to see
But now
One of us has to go (ah... doo)
You can't love two
No
Tell me

[CHORUS]

What made you think
That you
Could keep me hanging on a string?
If you can't make up your mind
I'll bow out gracefully, yeah
But one of us has to go (ah... doo)
You can't love two
No, no, no, oh

[CHORUS]

What's it gonna be?
I hope you can see
It's gotta be you and me
Baby (ah... doo, ooh)
Tell me...

What will you do
Baby, will you come through?
My heart's on the line
Baby, don't waste my time
[repeat]

Somebody's gonna win
Somebody's gonna lose
But you've got to choose, boy
Say it will be
You and me, baby
