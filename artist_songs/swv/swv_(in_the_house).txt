[Lelee:] 
Yeah, and it goes, and it goes 
And it goes a lil' something like this: HIT IT! 
Yeah, that's it 

[Taj:] 
Ahh, SWV's definitely in the house for the Nineties 

[Coko:] 
Definitely coming on strong, so step to the left 
Just to make room for the best 

[Hook:]
S-W-V (Sisters With Voices in the house) 
S-W-V (Sisters With Voices in the house) 
S-W-V (Sisters With Voices in the house) 

[Lelee:] 
Well we got Coko on the left 
We got Taj on the right 
We got Me in the middle 

[Taj:] 
So, get up tonight! 

[Coko:] 
Everytime I perform, it's the same old thing 
I make ya man's [d*ck] hard with the way I sing 
'Cause it's the C-to the-O-to the-K-to the-O 
Go for what you know, Ho, 'cause I'm COKO! 
Puttin' all you phony singing females in check 
I'm down with SWV, and I'ma come correct 
A lot of people tried to diss me, but that's okay 
Because now I got a record deal with RCA 
Yeah, I got it going on, and you know it's a fact 
That I perform live now, with no tracks 
'Cause you know I can sing, yes I can create 
And if you try to step to me, I'll set ya ass straight 
Tall, dark and lovely, dangerous and attack you 
I cannot wait to sing all over you and your wack crew 
So don't act dumb like you don't know what time it is 
Step to SWV, and you're bound to get JACKED! 

[Taj:] 
Yeah, that was summed up well 

[Hook: Until Fade]
