Baby I'm ready, Baby I'm ready

[Verse 1]
I used to..think I would never find the one,
who will know how to love me, boy this is something.
To hear your voice-mail, It make me wanna call and re-play-
the way that you talk yeah, boy you speaking my language
(I hear you saying..)

[Chorus]
Love will be right here, (I hear you saying)
I will dry your tears
Ready for a Wifey and Kids. (I hear you saying)
Never had nothing like this, Ooooohh
Baby, If you ask me for my Love
Then I will gladly give it up (Ooh)
Baby I co-sign, co-sign, co-sign
For your Lovin' I..
Co-sign, co-sign, baby I'm ready

[Verse 2]
When I'm with you, there is no place I'd rather be
Boy this is not me, don't stop what your doin' (yeah)
When you come around I don't know how to behave
I get so open, from all the words you spoken
(I hear you saying..)

[Chorus]
Love will be right here, (I hear you saying)
I will dry your tears
Ready for a Wifey and Kids. (I hear you saying)
Never had nothing like this, Ooooohh
Baby, If you ask me for my Love
Then I will gladly give it up (Ooh)
Baby I co-sign, co-sign, co-sign
For your Lovin' I..
Co-sign, co-sign, baby I'm ready
Baby! baby I'm ready

[Bridge]
I'll sign your name across my heart, ohh what I'll do
to making love with you boy
And I don't care how long it takes, cause I know that..

[Chorus]
Love will be right here, (I hear you saying)
I will dry your tears
Ready for a Wifey and Kids. (I hear you saying)
Never had nothing like this, heey
Baby, If you ask me for my Love
Then I will gladly give it up 
Baby I co-sign, co-sign, co-sign
For your Lovin' I..
Co-sign, co-sign, baby I'm ready
