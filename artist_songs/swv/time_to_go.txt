I I I I hear you talkin' but I'm not listenin' (listenin')
It's been about a hour, you ain't finished yet (finished yet)
So what's it gonna be? Catch your time to think
Shouldn't be that hard when it comes to this

I I I was your rock when you ain't have it (have it)
Now you actin' brand new. What's the deal here? (deal here)
I may run in the streets, I'm reaching a ring
I have had enough

So now it's time to go
Baby, that's your queue to leave
Ain't feelin' you no more
If that's how it's gonna be
Tell me why do you deserve another second chance (a second chance)
Now I'm gonna want to take a better man
So now it's time to go
Time to go, time to go

You you you you you think you prove but you're a little boy
Little boy, screamin' and shoutin'
Makin' all this noise
Don't even know what we're fightin' for
It makes no sense to me
But damn I thought I've told you to move to the left (to the left)
You playin' these games, I've got nothing else (I've got nothing else)
It is obvious and clear to me
I can't get through to you anymore

So now it's time to go
Baby, that's your queue to leave
Ain't feelin' you no more
If that's how it's gonna be
Tell me why do you deserve another second chance (a second chance)
Now I'm gonna want to take a better man
Time to go
Time to go, time to go

You can spy the settle thought of this one
No more lies
You're at the door

So now it's time to go (time to go)
Baby, that's your queue to leave
Ain't feelin' you no more (Ain't feelin' you no more)
If that's how it's gonna be
Tell me why do you deserve another second chance (a second chance)
Now I'm gonna want to take a better man
Time to go
Time to go, time to go (and it's time to go)

Time to go (go), time to go (go)
Time to go (go), time to go (go)
