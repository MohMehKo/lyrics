[Chorus:]
I can lose myself and all the freak in me can do 
I don't want nobody else because my body's wanting you 
Gotta have you 
Gotta touch you 
I just lose my self-control and all the freak and me can do 

[Verse:]
Something, bout you 
Got me feelin' like you know I'm willing to do 
Anything to please you 
Got me, open 
Rivers flowin slowly, you go deep inside my 
Body hold me tight, cause I can lose 

[Chorus]

Chocolate, kisses 
Melting in your mouth and on your fingers 
Licking, good and plenty of it 
(I love it when you give it all night) 
All night, (just right) 
I can't go one day, (without knowing) 
You're here, to hold my body tight, cause I lose 

[Chorus x2]

[Bridge:]
(No matter what you're doing you turn me on) 
Turn me on 
(I lose my self-control and my mind is gone) 
Mind is gone-- oh -- yeah (Can't nobody come and hold me) 
(I belong to you and you own me) Me 
(And everytime I see you, you make me sweat) 
(Thinkin' bout the love I'm gonna get) 
(I give myself to you - and no one else) oooh, OOooh 

[Chorus: Until Fade]
