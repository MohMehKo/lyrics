Bottom round, going out with that other lady
While I'm siting at home with you baby
Fool me once then I put the blame on you
Fool me twice now it's a shame on me
I prayed my heart, I'm gonna drive me crazy
All those times you slipped, I catch you here
You still running out it's not fair

Boy you think you know,
But you but you have no idea
How I loved you so,
And I need you here
Boy you think you know, but you have no idea
How I'm dieing slow, slow trying to keep you home
Trying to keep you home

Feels like I haven't smiled in forever
Standing by you knowing I deserve better
Loving you more than myself, Boy I hated
Knowing you gon' do the same thing again, baby
I break my heart, I break my heart
Oh boy you drive me crazy

All those times you slipped, I catch you here
You still running out it's not fair

Boy you think you know,
But you but you have no idea
How I loved you so,
And I need you here
Boy you think you know, but you have no idea
How I'm dieing slow, slow trying to keep you home
Trying to keep you home

Boy you think you know,
But you but you have no idea
How I loved you so,
And I need you here
Boy you think you know, but you have no idea
How I'm dieing slow, slow trying to keep you home
Trying to keep you home
