[Chorus:]
I'll always be here, for you 
I promise you 
I'll always stay 
Nothing can take my love away 
When ever you need a shoulder 
I'll be forever true 
There's nothing I won't do 

[Verse:]
Tell me what it is about your lovin' 
That makes me do anything for you 
I can't explain 
But the fact remains, I'm feelin'... 
Like whatever you do I'm never leaving you 
I'll always 

[Chorus]

[Verse:]
There are no words to describe how I get excited 
But it's easy to see I'm crazy-into you, you 
(I never had a love like this so baby) 
Make a promise that (you'll always stay with me) 
I'll always 

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I believe that (if you're really feeling love) 
(When it's true love) 
(You can't let it get away) 
(So baby that's why I'll say) 

[Chorus: Until Fade]
