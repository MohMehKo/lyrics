[1st verse:]

smiling..
you were always smiling
How could I have know that you were
Hiding..
your feelings from me
I wonder How could it be

your note is here
it says you don't love me
My worst fear 
is now reality

You picked a fine time 
2 tell me you don't love me
You picked a fine time 
2 tell me you don't care
and what I tought was love
was really just pretending
and your love for me
was never really there

[sec.verse:]
trying..
I am always trying
so understand the reason why I
crying..
day and night I am crying
I can't believe I was so blind

it is so clear
that you don't love me
My worst fear 
is now reality

You picked a fine time 
2 tell me you don't love me
You picked a fine time 
2 tell me you don't care
and what I tought was love
was really just pretending
and your love for me
was never really there

[bridge:]

how many nights did I sleep well
waiting by the phone
I couldn't see what was going on
told myself our love is 2 strong
I wish our trust came tumbling down
another love you have found
there's nothing left no more 2 hide
and there is no easy way 2 say goodbye

You picked a fine time 
2 tell me you don't love me
You picked a fine time 
2 tell me you don't care
and what I tought was love
was really just pretending
and your love for me
was never really there
