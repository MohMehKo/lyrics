SW, to the V, yeah, you know
Characters, lacin this trizzack
Oh I like this y'all, what?
Never thought I'd find love, till the day I found you, sugar
Never had no one to hold me like this (like this, like this)
What, oh no no, oh
Characters, what?
Oh oh
Like this what, like this what, oh

This time last year, I was feeling so alone
I never thought that you would come along
You changed my whole world
Now all I have is memories
My lonely days are gone
You changed the right from wrong

And I never
Never thought I'd find love
Till the day I found you, sugar (I never had no one)
Never had no one to hold me like this, (like this, like this)
No no no
(Repeat)

Never imagined just what it would be like
To have this feeling that I feel
Without you in my life
It's like a day of sunshine after days of cloudy skies
And when you held me in your arms
You opened up my eyes

And I tell the world that I'm in love (yeah, yeah)
And it feels so good to know
You're the one that I adore
Every day (everyday and night) you love me right
I don't want to trade it for nothing in this world

I never
Never thought I'd find love
Till the day I found you, sugar (I found you)
Never had no one to hold me like this (like this, like this)
No no no
[Repeat]

[Ceas]
Imagine this, me Ceas
E3's, JetSkis, palm trees
I know you like the way it sounds so take your pick hon
And watch this tongue go dead between your lips uh
While my niggaz be stazzin out, I blowin back spasms out
Your leather, my house
What's even better, my cheddar, your couch
It's now or never, my tongue in your mouth
I makes it happen, dumber than a Hummer with my man Trife trigga
Only boning girls with nice figures, ridin' dat digga
Whole figure, platnuim with gold diggers
So what's it gonna be girl, tell me who you roll with
Who you wanna be with, who you creep with
I giving you the green light, so if you the right hoe
Ask Joe, swear to God won't be a playa no mo', fo sho'

I never
Never thought I'd find love
Till the day I found you, sugar (I never felt this way)
Never had no one to hold me like this (like this, like this)
No no no
