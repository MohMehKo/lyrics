[Chorus:]
Keep your soul intact 
Don't let nothing hold you back 
Keep your soul intact 
Keep your soul intact 
Don't let nothing hold you back 
Keep your soul, intact 

[Verse:]
Don't let nothing hold you back 
Keep your head up towards the sky 
It's gonna be ruff, you can't give up 
Hold on (hold on) 

[Chorus]

Unity that's what we need 
Unity that's what we need
