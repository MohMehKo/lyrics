Never been the searchin' type, no, not me
Friends always said I was too naive
Cause I loved with all I've got
Never think of holdin' back
I won't let fear control me
I've come to know a little 'bout love, you see?
I know it don't come around every day, especially for me
So I'm standin' here, playin' for keeps
And I hope you feel the same about me

Could you be?
Be the one for me
That is really all I need (need)
Someone to love me unconditionally (unconditionally)

Could this be?
Be the one for me
That is really all I need (all I need)
Someone I can love unconditionally

Never been the frontin' type cause I believe
What you put out is what you will receive
And I'm giving everything I've got to give
It's the only way I know how to live
And I've been through ups and downs
And heart breaks and lonely nights
And even when tears was dryin'
My soul was steady cryin'
But I'll never give up on this thing
No matter what the joy or pain

Could you be?
Be the one for me (baby, you're the one for me)
That is really all I need (need)
Someone to love me unconditionally

Could this be? (Could this be?)
Be the one for me (the one for me)
That is really all I need
Someone I can love unconditionally

Is this reality or am I dreaming?
Cause what I feel right now may not be what I see
Are you the one that I've been waiting for?
And if you are, my heart's all yours

Could you be?
Be the one for me
That is really all I need (all I need)
Someone to love me unconditionally (unconditionally)

Could this be?
Be the one for me
That is really all I need
Someone I can love unconditionally (unconditionally)

Could you be? (Could you be?)
Be the one for me (be the one for me, babe)
That is really all I need (all I need)
Someone to love me unconditionally (unconditionally)

Could this be?
Be the one for me
That is really all I need
Someone I can love unconditionally
