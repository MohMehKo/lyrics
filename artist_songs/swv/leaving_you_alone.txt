I been a fool for you for way too long
And everytime I trust
Boy you prove me wrong
And time and time again
You're not even my friend
We're not even friends, no no no
You don't respect my heart
And I don't respect you
Could all the trifling situations even do
I love myself enough to put this to an end
Never again, no no no

[x2]
Loving you, is too much for me to handle
Baby I can't even stand it no more
It's true
Cause baby I deserve much better
And that's why I'm leaving you alone

Uh and I can't take this any longer
Boy I'm done
And I don't care 'bout what I lost
Cause now I won
And boy you know this thing is broke
Beyond repair
And I don't even care, no no no
And baby I gotta be honest with myself
Because I see myself in love with someone else
Someone who appreciates the woman that I am
I need a new man, no no no

[x2]
Loving you, is too much for me to handle
Baby I can't even stand it no more
It's true
Cause baby I deserve much better
And that's why I'm leaving you alone

[x2]
Loving you, is too much for me to handle
Baby I can't even stand it no more
It's true
Cause baby I deserve much better
And that's why I'm leaving you alone
