She got my eyes
She got my hair
Go on and stare
Complexion the same
It wouldn't be the same if you knew she didn't care
About you the way that I do now
So don't go thinkin' that she's better than I

I'm a keep it one hun-dred
She ain't got nothin' I can prove why
She ain't got nothin' on my uh-ah
Don't go thinkin' that she's better than I

I'm gonna show you
She ain't got nothing I can prove why
Well, I'm gonna show you while I'm finna
Finna finna finna finna do now

She doesn't cook
She doesn't clean
Steam you jeans
She always rush
Doesn't take much
To do to win your love
You're something in common we share but
Don't go thinkin' that she's better than I

Boy, you got plenty to choose
Boy, don't forget the 80-20 rule
So what she does
It don't even matter (It don't even matter)
Cause I do my things better

I'm a keep it one hun-dred
She ain't got nothin' I can prove why
She ain't got nothin' on my uh-ah
Don't go thinkin' that she's better than I

I'm gonna show you
She ain't got nothin' I can prove why
Boy, I'm gonna show you what I'm finna
Finna finna finna finna do now

Way before you saw me walkin' down the aisle you told me
I'm the type of girl to stand out in a crowd
You said you liked my smile way before we said our vows
I was your Tenderoni and you was my Bobby Brown
Ba-ba-baby take a ride, you've been playin' me a while
Gamin her too, got us both like wow
But I'm fin to hit the dial if you're still out on the prowl
And you can't commit to vows cause you keep committin' fouls

Boy, you got plenty to choose
Boy, don't forget 80-20 rules
So what she does
It don't even matter (It don't even matter)
Cause I do my things better

I'm a keep it one hun-dred
She ain't got nothin' I can prove why
She ain't got nothin' on my uh-ah
Don't go thinkin' that she's better than I

I'm gonna show you
She ain't got nothin' that I prove why
Well, I'm gonna show you what I'm finna
Finna finna finna finna do now

I'm a keep it one hun-dred
She ain't got nothin' I can prove why
(She ain't got what I got baby)
She ain't got nothin' on my uh-ah
Don't go thinkin' that she's better than I
(Don't go thinkin' that she's better than I)

I'm gonna show you
She ain't got nothin' I can prove why
Well, I'm gonna show you what I'm finna
Finna finna finna finna do now
