Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohhhhhhh 
Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohhhhhhh 

[Verse 1:]
I need someone who I can share all my dreams with 
That's what I need 
Someone special, who will love me just for me 
That's what I need 
I need someone to hold me tight 
To give good loving all night 
So many times I've opened up my heart 
Only to have someone tear it apart 
That's why I need... 

[Chorus:]
Someone to treat me right, make love all through the night 
That's what I need 
(Boy, I've been hurt before) I've been hurt before 
Real love I'm looking for 
That's what I need 
Real love... 

[Verse 2:]
I need someone who will never leave me lonely 
That's what I need 
Someone faithful, who'll love me as their one and only 
That's what I need. 
I need someone to share my ups and downs 
And even through the bad times, will always be around 
So many times I've opened up my heart, 
Only to have someone tear it apart. I need... 

[Chorus:]
Someone to treat me right (treat me right) 
Make love all through the night (I need it) 
That's what I need 
(I've been hurt before) I've been hurt before 
(Real love) Real love I'm looking for 
That's what I need 

[Breakdown:]
Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohhhhhh... 
Someone who will treat me right, make sweet love all through the night 
Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohhhhhh... 
Someone who'll love me for me, a real love 
That's what I need 

[Chorus: Until Fade]
