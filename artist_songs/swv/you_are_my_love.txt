[Verse:]
There's no love I know 
Greater than your love, baby for sure 
And I've searched far and wide 
And the stars above 
But no love endures 
So please return your love to me 
You know that we should be together 
In love forever 
You are the one that I need 

[Chorus:]
You are my love 
And I need you here to love me 
I need you here I swear 
You are my love 
And I want you to warm me 
I'll always need you there 

[Verse:]
There's no pain I know 
Like the pain I feel, feel in my heart 
And I have cried, lord knows I've cried 
But I still have the will 
I hope you're not far, oh 
If you could only here the words 
I'm sorry that I hurt you baby 
I must been crazy 
Come back wherever you are 

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
There's a certain amount of love I need 
I'll never give up till you're here with me 
Lord knows you're (all I'm longing for) 
Hmm, you see I never knew how much in love I was 
I'm sorry for all the wrong I've done 
(All the wrong I've done forgive me - you) 
Forgive me baby, you are the only one

[Chorus: Until Fade]
