I get so weak......
I get so weak 
In the knees I can hardly speak with you
(Somethin bout the way ya do)
i get so weak
In the knees I can hardly speak with you
(Somethin bout the way ya do)

[verse 1]
I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when ya do what ya doin
It's a feeling I don't understand

Cuz my heart starts beating triple times 
With thoughts of lovin you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do 
When the cause and cure is you

[chorus]

[verse 2]
Time after time after time I try to fight it
Your love is strong it keeps me holdin on
Resistance is down when your around cries fading
In your condition I don't wanna be alone

Cuz my heart keeps beating triple times
With thoughts of lovin you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you

[chorus]

[Bridge]
I try hard to fight it
No way can I deny it
Your love's so sweet
Knocks me off my feet

[chorus]

[Verse 3]
-I get so weak-
Blood starts racin through my veins
-I get so weak-
Boy it's somethin I can't explain
-I get so weak-
Ohhhhohhhiiiiiilooveeemyybabe

[chorus until fade]
