What is LOVE? LOVE is an experience everyone should have, it's not always FUN... But it's ALWAYS SPECIAL... The sweet struggle that seals the past, and builds the future... A LOVE that can weather a storm is an AMAZING LOVE...

[Chorus:]
Tell me why is love the way it is...
Joy and pain is all in the game of love...
I don't know it's hard to say but, who am I to blame...
Love is so amazing, amazing (amazing)

[Verse 1:]
How many heartaches does it take 'til this girl becomes a woman...
How many tears must I cry 'til my heart mends...
But as much as I try to get over it, my heart calls for you...
Why is love this way... ooh....
Does it have to be this way?
(So tell me why) Why...
(Is it me) Is it me or you...
(Or is this how) I often wonder.
(Love should be) Love is so amazing...

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
It seems kinda silly to sit and wonder where you are... Mmmm...
But I cannot sleep or dream sweet dreams without you...
I - I - know that I have to be strong if I wanna get over you (gotta stay strong)
Why is love this way, mmm... Does it have to be this way?
(So tell me why) So tell me why...
(Is it me) Is it me or you...
(Or is this how) I often wonder why...
(Love should be) Love is so amazing...

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Love comes from the heart... (Love comes from the heart)
And the mind... (And the mind when you least expect it to)
You need to find... (Find you someone kind)
You need to find... (Find someone who's there for you)
Uhh... Uhh... Uhh... Uhhhhhh...

[Chorus x3: fade]
