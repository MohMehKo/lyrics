Oooh babe,
Ain't nothing like waking up everyday to your face
Never wanna let go, never wanna say no
It's crazy,
And deeper than love it's hard to even try to explain
So all my ladies who know, what I'm talk'n bout say oh (oh)
It's like you come alive when you hear their voice
No, your heart doesn't have a choice
Oh, and I've had my share of boys
If you know like I know

That ain't nothing like a man
No, no little boys for me
I don't do rookies, get with me, you've gotta own the team
Ain't no man like the one I've got
Ain't no man like the one I've got
Ain't nothing like a man

Yep, he know he got a Queen
Now ladies if you've got a King say it with me now
Ain't no man like the one I've got
Ain't no man like the one I've got

And the truth is, there's women all across the world
Getting tired... Please (so please)
Never wanna let go, never wanna say no
I don't miss the drama and the sleepless nights
Wasting all of my tears, wasting all of my tears
So all my ladies who know (know), what I'm talk'n bout say oh (oh)
