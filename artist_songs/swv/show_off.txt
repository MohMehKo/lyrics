Come and talk to me, get on your grown tip
Make me feel like you really want it
If you want it, then you can get it
Let me put it on you with a song, come on
I'm waitin' to see

I've been leanin' for love, I'm ready for ya
I'm on one so baby don't stop
Get it, get it on, show off, show off
Baby show me how you do that
Show off, show off, baby show me how you do that
If I give you something good, you'd better be good
Baby tell me how you do that
I'm ready for your love
So baby don't stop, get it, get it

Come and talk to me, stop wastin' time
Get me while I'm in this vibe, this vibe
Got me feelin'
I gotta wanna go home, alone
If you feel me, let me know

I've been leanin' for love, I'm ready for ya
I'm on one so baby don't stop
Get it, get it on, show off, show off
Baby show me how you do that
Show off, show off, baby show me how you do that
If I give you something good, you'd better be good
Baby tell me how you do that
I'm ready for your love
So baby don't stop, get it, get it

Show off, with you I blow my dough off
Ride 'round, tryna hit a lick to make more off
'Bout to hit the streets, Lamborghini with the door off
I mean dough up, baby know what?
Come to my crib, baby I stay on the beach
She rockin' bikini, yea, she enjoyin' the heat
Miami Heat, triple A across the street
I'm showin' off, so we eatin' at Felipe
Party party party, I just wanna freak your body
I just wanna push it like you body a Bugatti
I'll be on you by the week-end, baby girl you got me weak
And I'm so into you cause you're the one, you're my Lil' Lee
Use Siroq cause I know you
With the two shots to make you admit it
A.X. be showin' off, you goin' off on how I get
You my baby, let me babysit it
Rock your body, every day you get it
Watch my love rain down on you with the candles litted

Show off, show off, baby show me how you do that
Show off, show off, baby show me how you do that
If I give you something good, you'd better be good
Baby tell me how you do that
I'm ready for your love
So baby don't stop, get it, get it

Show off, show off, baby show me how you do that
Show off, show off, baby show me how you do that
If I give you something good, you'd better be good
Baby tell me how you do that
I'm ready for your love
So baby don't stop, get it, get it
