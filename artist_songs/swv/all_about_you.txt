Hey yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ah yeah, yeah

Yesterday changed my mind
Now I see you as one of a kind
How I really need you
(How I really need you)
Hope you feel the same way too
(Hope you feel the same way)

'Cause if you look
(If you look, you will find)
It's me
(It's me you need in your life)
It's really not about me
It's really all about you

It's drivin' me crazy, can't figure you out
How to keep you steady going this route
Tell me that you feel the same
(Tell me that you feel the same)
The thought has crossed, you won't remain
(The thought has crossed, you won't remain)

Just to think
(Just to think that I)
Could bring joy
(Could bring joy in your life)
It's really not about me
(It's really all about you)

I know what you're going through
Every girl expects from you
They just wanna
(Take control)
You'll never have to figure out
I'm one woman who's not with that crowd
You've gotta believe me

It's really all about you
It's really all about you
It's really all about you
It's really all about you

(It's really not about me)
(It's really all about you)
So I'll give
(I'll give you time)
To let go what's hurting inside
(To let go what's on your mind)

It's really not about me
(It's really all about you)
(It's really all about you)
(It's really all about you)
It's really all, it's really all, all about you
It's really all about you

(It's really all about you)
'Bout you, 'bout you, baby, yeah
It's really all about you
All about ya baby
(It's really all about you)
It's really all about you, yeah
Oh yes it is
