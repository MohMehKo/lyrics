(Where is the love) 
Where 
(That you promised me) 
That you promised me 
(Or are those days and the nights that we spent just a fantasy) 
Just a fantasy 
(Where is the love) 
Where is the love 
(That you said we would share) 
(Why did I wake up this morning to find that you were not there) 

(Verse) 
You picked a fine time to tell me that you did not love me 
(You did not love me baby) 
And after all this time I thought that you were only thinkin' of me 
Sometimes I feel like I could sit right down and just (cry) 
But all that I can do tonight is wonder as I ask myself why 
(Where is the love) 
Where is the love hey hoooeey hey
