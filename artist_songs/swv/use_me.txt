I'd like to make a special dedication now to you
For being just who you are and loving me so good
Cause often times I make the simple things complicated
But you never give up on me, it's worse

So won't you use me?
I'll be your vessel for love (vessel for love)
I'll give my heart to you
Won't you use me?
Take me, I'm yours
Don't let me go, no, no

Difficult is not associated in your mind
Cause you understand this kind of love takes some time
You're strong enough that if I were down you'd still fight
And with this I believe there's no other man for me

So won't you use me?
I'll be your vessel for love (vessel for love)
I'll give my heart to you
Won't you use me?
So just take me, I'm yours
Don't let me go, no, no

Oh, what would I give so I can spend my life with you
There is never a day I want you away
I keep you here close to me (keep you here close to me)
Forever

So won't you use me?
I'll be your vessel for love (vessel for love)
I'll give my heart to you
Won't you use me?
So just take me, I'm yours
Don't let me go, no, no
