[Chorus:]
It goes on and on 
We won't stop to the break of dawn - go 
On and on - got to keep on movin' on 
On and On till we get enough 
You know how we do it 

[Verse:]
Feels so good to see 
Everybody down with me 
Everything's al right 
Cause we're groovin' to this vibe 
Life can be so sweet if you can swing with me 
Party's on tonight - everybody knows 
(That there's no doubt about it) 
Baby it's on, I'm ready to dance all night long 
(Find somebody) 
Get my groove on - party through the night 
Until the morning light (you know how we do it) 

[Chorus]

[Verse:]
I know just what to do 
To get the best from you - uh huh 
(Baby I can tell you what I got to show you) 
I'm flexible, sexible, some say I'm incredible 
Ohh - you're gonna like it 
(That there's no doubt about it) 
Baby it's on, I'm ready to dance all night long 
(Find somebody) 
Get my groove on - party through the night 
Until the morning light (you know how we do it) 

[Chorus]

[Erick Serman:] 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
I grab the mike and I react like Noah 
The rhyme flow of my style is Rocky Balboa 
We make's it hot like Coko, Lelee and Taj 
Oh my god 
I be the flyest thing since TV 
And ya'll watchin' me and SWV 
Prompt the lawn chair lay back like the rap word is bond 
And let's rock the spot on and on uh
