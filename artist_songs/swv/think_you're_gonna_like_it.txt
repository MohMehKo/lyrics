[Chorus:]
Think you're gonna like it (think you're gonna like it) 
Sure you're gonna like it (sure you're gonna like it, boy) 
Think you're gonna like it (think you're gonna like it) 
Sure you're gonna like it (sure you're gonna like it, boy) 

[Verse 1:]
Walked in a crowded room, I saw no one else but you 
I got something on my mind 
Come real close and you will find 
What's going on? Let's do this right 
Make love tonight 
I got something that I think you'll like 

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Boy any part of me 
Is a vasicle of life 
I can't find the words to say that 
You are so fine 
So, tell me what's going on (on) 
Let's do this right 
Make love tonight (tonight) 
I got something that I think you'll like 

[Chorus x2]

[Ad-lib: During Chorus] 
Heeeeeey, I think you will 
I know you're gonna like it, baby 
You're gonna want it, you're gonna need it 
You're gonna want this thing again and again, yeah 
I know you're gonna like it 
Ain't no doubt about it you will, yeah 
I'm sure you will 
Baby, you'll like it, you'll need it 
I got it, you need it, I know you're gonna like it, boy 
Don't you like it, don't you need it 
Think you're gonna like it
