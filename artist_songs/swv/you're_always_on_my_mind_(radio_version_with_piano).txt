You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
On my mind

Boy, I can't seem to get you out of my head
But there's something about you that makes me smile
Don't change, I like the way you make me feel
Can we take our time and do this for a while?

Girl, I never thought I'd find someone to love me
Now, you're the only one I want in my life
And the special touch you give comes from you only
I guess that's why you're always on my mind

You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind, on my mind

Sometimes, I find it hard to concentrate
Because thoughts of us together fill my head
When you're away, it's hard to sleep at night
So, my pillow, like my thoughts of you, I hold tight

Girl, I never thought I'd find someone to love me
Now, you're the only one I want in my life
And the special touch you give comes from you only
I guess that's why you're always on my mind

You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind, on my mind

Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you

You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind

Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
I can't stop
