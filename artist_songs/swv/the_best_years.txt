He tapped me on my shoulder, so unexpected
I started to hug him but paused for a second
And that's when he showed me an old picture that he had oh
Then we started talkin' and reminiscin'
And at first I smiled, then I started to remember
That my memories of us are all bad
That's when I told him

It took me some time to get over you
Had to wrap my head around what I let you do
I was young, I was dumb, I played the fool
But one thing today prove
I gave you the best years of your life (of your life)
Now you wanna get back what you missed
But I cannot forget about what you did
I gave you the best years of your life, your life
I gave you, yea
I gave you the best years of your life

I ain't gonna lie, for a while I was bitter
Acid to my stomach every time I saw you with 'er
I know she was all those texts and late night phone calls (late night phone calls)
When you had an emergency and rushed out of home
I bet she was on the other side of the phone
Now you stand here saying you love me still (you don't love me)
I guess the grass was greener, yea

It took me some time to get over you
Had to wrap my head around what I let you do
I was young, I was dumb, I played the fool
But one thing today prove
I gave you the best years of your life (of your life)
Now you wanna get back what you missed
But I cannot forget about what you did
I gave you the best years of your life, your life (of your life)
I gave you, yea
I gave you the best years of your life (life)

Baby, ain't nobody gonna love you like I did
You'll never miss a good thing until it's gone forever
You must be out your mind
That she can give you
What you're lookin' for
Cause I know I gave you

I gave you the best years of your life (best years of your life)
Now you wanna get back what you missed
I just cannot forget about what you did
I gave you the best years of your life, your life (of your life)
I gave you, yea
I gave you the best years of your life

Just say it (say it)
I'll do it (I'll do it)
Whatever
Whatever
You're honest, I trust you
Oh, I'll follow you wherever (wherever)
If your love is overseas that's just where I'll be
Be right by your side
Love you all the time
I love you
I love you
