When you cry
Boy I cry
Don't let go
Or I'll die

[CHORUS]
When you cry
Baby, I cry
And if you take your love away
I'll just die
If you love me once
I'll love you twice
So promise me
You'll love me for the rest of my life

There's no better place
I'd rather be than in your arms
Holdin' you close to me
Lookin' in your eyes
Let's me know
That you'll always be here
And your love ain't goin' away
Oh
[CHORUS]

It'd break my heart
If you went away
And I don't think that I
Could make it throught the day
And I
Feel the way you do-ooh
And when you cry
Baby, I'm crying, too
Ohh oh oh oh
[CHORUS]

When I see tears
Fall from your face (fall from your face)
Baby, I know no one can take my place (take my place)
And in when I look in your eyes
And see you cry
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby
I'll just die

[CHORUS]
When you cry
Boy I'll cry don't let go
Or I'll die
If you love me once
I'll love you twice
So promise me
You'll love me for the rest of my life
