I must have rehearsed my lines a thousand times
Until I have them memorized
But when I get a good nerve to tell you the words
They just never seem to come out right

If only you knew
How much I do
Do love you yea, yea

If only you knew
How much I do
Do need you

I dream of moments we share
But you're not there
I'm livin' in a fantasy
Cause you don't even suspect
Could probably care less
About the changes I've been going through

[Chorus:]
If only you knew (only you knew)
How much I do
Do love you

If only you knew
How much I do
Do need you (need you)

Cause you don't even suspect
Could probably care less
About the changes I've been going through

[Chorus:]
If only you knew (only you knew)
How much I do
Do love you

If only you knew (only you knew, baby)
How much I do
Do need you

[Chorus:]
If only you knew (only you knew, baby)
How much I do
Do love you

If only you knew
How much I do
I do need you

If, if, if our love gets right
You don't know
I said you don't know how much I need you

[Chorus:]
If only you knew
How much I do
I said you don't know
You don't know
You don't know

If only you knew
How much I do
Do need you
