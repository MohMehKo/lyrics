I've known you long enough to know you ain't feeling love
Spendin' money is not spendin' time
A million dollars ain't good enough
How can we communicate if we don't speak?

Baby don't let nothing break us, let's keep it concrete
A hopeless romantic, I can't stand this (no no no)
Been through too much to be takin' this for granted (no no no, no no no)
Swear to God, I'm here for you

Baby don't let nothing break us, let's keep it concrete
Boy, you're my heart yeah, I'm down for you rich or poor

We'll still be right here
I put it on, everything I love
You're my everything yeah it will hurt if you'll leave

I'll still be right here
I put it on, everything I love

We can move, but losing us ain't worth it
And maybe I'm a hold on (it's something worth it)
Like a pass and we drop the ball
I'm incomplete

Baby don't let nothing break us, let's keep it concrete
Boy, you're my heart yeah I'm down for you rich or poor

We'll still be right here
I put it on, everything I love
You're my everything yeah it will hurt if you'll leave

I'll still be right here
I put it on, everything I love

I know nothing lasts forever
If we try we'll make it to the day after
Uuu, there's my, it'd better be you and me

Don't let nothing break us, let's keep it concrete
Boy, you're my heart yeah, I'm down for you rich or poor

We'll still be right here
I put it on, everything I love
You're my everything yeah it will hurt if you'll leave (You're everything)

I'll still be right here
I put it on, everything I love

Boy, you're my heart yeah I'm down for you rich or poor
If you'll still be right here
I put it on, everything I love
You're my everything yeah it will hurt if you'll leave (You're my everything)

I'll still be right here
I put it on, everything I love
