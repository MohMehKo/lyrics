[Verse 1:]
Baby, you can call on me 
Anytime that you feel the need 
And I'll be there in a hurry 
Giving you the best of me 
And baby you know I keep it nice and warm to satisfy 
Baby you know that I am always hot for you 
And if there's any kinda love that will exemplify 
My sweetie, I have got that kinda love times two 

[Chorus:]
Boy I'll do you all night long 
Do you anyway you want 
I will do you all night long 
I wanna please you 
Don't wanna tease you 

[Verse 2:]
You can melt in my body 
And I will slowly melt on you 
Caress your face in my valley 
Let me feel the sweetness of you 
And baby you know I keep it special each and every time 
I never do nothing once and never quite the same 
And baby you know if there is anything you want from me 
I will supply so you can have it your way 

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
(Here's the vibe) 
Here's the vibe, there's candlelight 
As I undress for you, baby 
(A sip of wine) 
A sip of wine, we take our time 
Then I undress you, too 
(I look at you) 
I look at you, you look at me 
And then we both embrace 
(Let nature take its place) 
And then we just let nature take its place 

[Chorus & Ad-lib Until Fade]
