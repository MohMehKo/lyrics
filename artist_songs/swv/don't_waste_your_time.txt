[Chorus:]
Don't waist your time 
You should be mine 
Come get to know my love, my love 
Don't look no more 
You can be sure 
Come get to know my love

[Verse:]
Baby can you tell me 
What it takes 
To get to know your love 
I want you love me in every way 
I got what you're waiting for 
Don't waist your time, no 

[Chorus]

[Verse:]
Here in my arms is where you should be 
No need to be alone 
I can fulfill your fantasy 
Give your real lovin' to me 
(If time is what this is all about) 
If time is what you need 
(Then I'm sure we can work it out) 
(Please just listen to me) Please
(I know I can make you happy) 

[Chorus: Until Fade]
