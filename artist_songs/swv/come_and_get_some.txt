[E-40:] 
Might not be fax machine 
But I got a little bit of paper 
Misieur Coko with my 40 ounce 
Let's make a boilin' makah 
My thing a majid be straight up on swoll 
Like I'm fresh outa the pin 
Wearin a uniform, standin at attention 
Perkin on some of that ruby red grapefruit juice, gin and must I mention 
It leans to the side like the Ifle tower nice and naughty 
Nigga talkin' about; who the hell he think he is Ron high tower or some damn body 
I ain't no slippin' in your talkin playboys partner's limpin' 
After the club you can me and my doods in the parking lot sasquash pimpin' 
Ballin' tactics, up outa the yeh all damn day 
What's up with matrees, let display my survey 
We can kinda like take our time and do some ole' nice and slow 
About two and half hours of romantic business or we can hurry up and do some speedy Gonzalas 
Betta get your rock off before your daddy get home in 20 minutes 
Smell me on this one, sneakin' out of windows 
Hopin' over backyard fences of the hendges is he feezy fozzy reezy 
Tryin' to spit came at Taj and Lelee, SWV 

[Chorus]

[Breakdown:]
(I wanna keep it long and love you slow) 
(My baby boy you bring me so much joy) 
So much joy yeah, ooh 
(I'm gonna make it right) 
(Make your night, my baby boy, I know you will enjoy) 
I know you will enjoy, come on, come on 

[Chorus: Until Fade]
