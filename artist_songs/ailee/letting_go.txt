[Korean:]

어디서부터 잘못된 걸까 oh god
너를 만나도 웃지도 않고
답답해져 가는걸
시간이 지나면 지날수록 쌓이는 건
의심과 집착
솔직히 나 불안해
It's better that you're gone

조금만 더 솔직해져
늘어가는 네 거짓말
외워가는 너의 변명
뻔뻔한 너의 story

추억 속에 남은 널 지워
바보같이 너를 믿은 날 지워
No, not another word
더 이상 날 잡지마

I'm letting go letting go
아니라 하지마 cause I'm letting go
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
I'm letting go letting go
두 손 두 발 들어 and I'm letting go
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Cause you don't

Oh oh (actin like you right)
Oh oh (our dreams gone tonight)
두 얼굴 가진 너
너무 변해 버린 너
Cause you don't

뻔하지 너의 story
니 입은 침묵을 지켜
내 시선을 회피하지 초점은 땅을 찍고
니 떨리는 동공이
어떤 말보다 더 크게 내게
내가 뭘 믿었는지 잘 알리고 있어

변해가는 니 모습에
추억들은 타 왔고
결국 재들은 절망이 돼서
후회로 날 덮어
내 눈물은 너 아닌
지난 내가 싫어서
역겨웠던 내게 손 떼
널 완전히 비웠어

조금만 더 솔직해져
질렸어 너의 거짓말
이제는 나 니가 보여
뻔뻔한 너의 story

난 내가 할 짓 다 했어
But 넌 만족을 못 채웠지
이 쇼는 오래됐고
질릴 때도 됐지
내 시간 노력 쓸데없던 아픔
설레임은 뜻밖에 독한
이별과 함께 black out

I'm letting go letting go
아니라 하지마 cause I'm letting go
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
I'm letting go letting go
두 손 두 발 들어 and I'm letting go
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Cause you don't

자존심 같은 건 내게 내세우지마
너 마지막까지 너무 찌질하잖아
행복했었던 우리들의 기억들
이젠 재미없는 쇼에 막을 내려

더 이상 나는 후회하지 않을 거야
Cause all I have it my faith in me

I'm letting go letting go
아니라 하지마 cause I'm letting go
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
I'm letting go letting go

Cause you don't

Oh oh (actin like you right)
Oh oh (our dreams gone tonight)
미련도 없이 널
잊을게 이대로

[English translation:]

Where did it start to go wrong oh god
Even when I meet you I didn't laugh
I'm suffocated
As time goes
Doubt and obsession grow more
Actually I'm anxious
It's better that you're gone

Please be a little more honest
Your growing lies
Your memorized excuse
Your bold story

Erase the memories inside that left
Forget the stupid me who believed you
No not another word
Don't hold on to me anymore

I'm letting go letting go
Don't say no cause I'm letting go
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
I'm letting go letting go
Raise two hands and two feet and I'm letting go
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Cause you don't

Oh oh (actin like you right)
Oh oh (our dreams gone tonight)
You who got two faces
You who changes so much
Cause you don't

Your obvious story
Protect your silent mouth
Avoid my gaze, focus to the ground
Your trembling eyes
Rather than any words, louder to me
Tell me what I believed

Your changes appearance
All memories came
In the end they become despair
And changes into regret
My tears is not you
Because I hate the past me
Get your disgusting hands off of me
I totally hate you

Please be a little more honest
I'm tired of your lies
Now I see you
Your bold story

I've done everything I can
But you're never satisfied
This show has been so long
It's time to be sick of it
My times, effort, the useless hurt
The fluttering unexpectedly strong
Together with farewell, black out

I'm letting go letting go
Don't say no cause I'm letting go
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
I'm letting go letting go
Raise two hands and two feet and I'm letting go
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Cause you don't

The things like pride don't put it to me
You have been a loser till the end
Our happy memories
Now end the unfunny show

I won't regret anymore
Cause all I have it my faith in me

I'm letting go letting go
Don't say no cause I'm letting go
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
I'm letting go letting go
Raise two hands and two feet and I'm letting go
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Cause you don't

Oh oh (actin like you right)
Oh oh (our dreams gone tonight)
I have no regret
I will forget like this
