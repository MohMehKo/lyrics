[English translation:]

12 hours, one day, one month and five minutes have passed
It’s already been that long since we broke up
Without knowing, I was counting that time

It seemed like everything was fine
I was eating and sleeping fine
But suddenly, I think of you
Like getting a sudden illness
You’re not here anymore

I’ll try missing you
I’ll try thinking of you a little more
Just once, just twice
There’s no reason I can’t
I’ll try crying by myself
Because I’m the one who’s hurting
It’s a sickness that isn’t even a sickness
So it’s not hard, it’ll be okay

Spring, summer, fall, winter
And one year has passed
It’s already been that long since we broke up
Without knowing, I was counting that time

It seemed like everything was fine
I was eating and sleeping fine
But suddenly, I think of you
Like getting a sudden illness
You’re not here anymore

I’ll try missing you
I’ll try thinking of you a little more
Just once, just twice
There’s no reason I can’t
I’ll try crying by myself
Because I’m the one who’s hurting
It’s a sickness that isn’t even a sickness
So it’s not hard

It’ll be okay
If only I am hurting like this
I will slowly forget you
I’ll be okay
I keep telling myself this

I’ll try erasing you
I won’t think of you anymore
Just once, just twice
Thought it might be hard
I don’t want to cry by myself
Because I’ll erase you
It’s a sickness that isn’t even a sickness
So it’s not hard, it’ll be okay
