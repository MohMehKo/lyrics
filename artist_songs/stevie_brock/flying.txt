[Chorus]
Flyin' high flyin' fee
We're kids and that's the way that we
Want it
Here we go 1-2-3
You see that there's no one that can 
Stop us
Flyin'

Takin' off, we're gonna reach the sky
Ger ready 'cause there's nothing that
We can't do
We are the voice of
The nation
You can doo anything
You believe in
Your dreams belong to you
Come on

[Chorus]
Flyin' high flyin' fee
We're kids and that's the way that we
Want it
Here we go 1-2-3
You see that there's no one that can 
Stop us
Flyin'

Headin' out, the crew is ready to fly
Get ready
Nobody's gonna stand in
Our way
We are the voice of
The nation
