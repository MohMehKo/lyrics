I Just Got Back From A Vary Cool Trip
Along The Milky way
I Stopped Off At The North Pole
To Spend The Holiday
I Caught On Old St. Nick To See What I Could See
He Took Me To He’s Workshop
And Told His Plans To Me
Now Santa You See Is A Vary Busy Man
And He Has No Tome To Play
He’s Got Millions Of Stockings To Fill On Christmas Day
So Better Write Your Letter Now
And Mail It Right Away
Cause  He’s Getting Ready 
Reindeer and He’s Sleigh

Oh! You better watch out, 
you better not cry, 
you better not pout,
I'm telling you why:
Santa Claus is coming to town! 

He's making a list,
He's checking it twice,
gonna find out who's naughty or nice.
Santa Claus is coming to town! 
He sees you when you're sleeping,
he knows when you're awake. 
He knows when you've been bad or good,
so be good for goodness sake!

So...You better watch out, You better not cry
You better not pout, I'm Telling you why.
Santa Claus is coming to town.
Little tin horns, little toy drums.
Rudy-toot-toot and rummy tum tums.
Santa Claus is coming to town.

Little toy dolls that cuddle and coo,
Elephants, boats and Kiddie cars too.
Santa Claus is coming to town.

The kids in Girl and boy land
will have a jubilee.
They're gonna build a toy land town
all around the Christmas tree.

Ohh....You better watch out, you better not cry.
You better not pout, I'm telling you why.
Santa Claus is coming to town.
