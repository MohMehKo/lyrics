[CHORUS]
Never wanna give you up
You're all I want 
Never wanna let you go
I need your love
Never wanna say goodbye
Cause you're the kind
That can make me give all 
The love I got
Never wanna give you up
Can't get enough
Never wanna let you down
I swear I'll be there for you
Show you how I really feel
Never wanna give you up girl

Give you up
Give you up

Let me tell you a little story
'bout this girl I know
She's everything a man could
Ever want and more
She's the kind of girl that always
Keeps her head up high
She never lets me down the girl is 
Always on time
Now ever since the day I knew her
From the start
She's got a way that always sets 
Herself apart
Breakin' rules 
She changes like the weather
Honey thats the way you are yeah

[CHORUS]

I've been around the world 
And every place I go
I've never seen such a girl
That's ever looked so good
With the smile 
With the style
With the big brown eyes
The way you wear your perfume
You know you mean so much to me
I'll take you places that you've never
Seen before now honey 
Cuz my love's your love
Gotta let you know

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE]
All I wanna do is get next t oyou 
Never wanna give you up girl
Let me hold your hand baby show me 
That you love me
Show me that you love me

All I wanna do is just get with you
Never wanna give you up girl
Make it last forever always be together
Give you all my love girl I never wanna 
Give you up

[CHORUS]
