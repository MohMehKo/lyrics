[speaking]
You no girl, my heart goes out to you
Hear me out now, cuz it's all for love

[singing]
I'm so glad you're my girl
I'll do anything for you
Call you every night
And give you flowers, too
I thank the Lord for you
And think about you all the time
I ask Him everyday
That you'll forever be mine

I wanna hold your hand
To show you I'll be there
I like to do the things
That let to know I care
I sing this lullaby
'Cause girl you fill me full
I look into your eyes
You're so beautiful

Oh girl I think I love ya
I'm always thinkin' of ya
I want you to know I'd do it all for love
I love it when we're together
Girl I need you forever
And want you to know I do it all for love

I will never leave you, Sugar
This I guarantee
I look into the future
I see you and me
Knight in shining armor
I will be your fairy tale
I wanna take care of you
Girl, I'll serve you well.

I will be there for you
To catch you when you fall
I'll hold you in my arms
That's where you belong
I sing this lullaby
'Cause girl you fill me full
I look into your eyes
You're so beautiful...beautiful...yeah!

Oh girl I think I love ya
I'm always thinkin' of ya
I want you to know I'd do it all for love
I love it when we're together
Girl I need you forever
And want you to know I do it all for love

[speaking part]
Yo-Come here, sweetheart
I want you to know something all right
See everyday in my life without you
Would be like a hundred years
The distance between us
An ocean of tears
See all the things I do for you
Are for love-- dig it

[singing]
All for lovin' (all for love)
All for you (you, you, you)
All for lovin' you (you)

Oh girl I think I love ya
I'm always thinkin' of ya
I want you to know I'd do it all for love
I love it when we're together
Girl I need you forever
And want you to know I do it all for love
