In love, in love, in love

Girl you know it's true (girl) 
Oh, oh, oh, I love you

I'm in love with you, girl
Cause I have on my mind 
You're the one
I think about most everytime
And when you pack a smile
In everything you do
Don't you understand,girl, 
This love is true

Your soft, silky hand all sweet and thin
It makes me want to hold 
It again and again
You lighten up my day and
That's oh so true
Together we're one, 
Separated we're two

To make you all mine, 
All mine is my desire
Cause you contain a 
Quality that I admire
You're pretty and simple, 
You rule my world 

So try to understand
I'm in love girl, in love
I'm so in love girl, in love
I'm just in love girl, and this is true

[CHORUS]
Girl you know it's true, oh, oh, oh 
I love you
Yes you know it's true, oh, oh, oh
I love you (girls I love you)
Girl you know it's true

My love is for you
Girl you know it's true
My love is for you

It's a funny thing girl I can't explain
My eyes light up 
When I hear your name
When you sweet, sweet voice rings in 
My ears
I just can't wait girl, until you're here
And your positive outlook 
I really enjoy
It's just like a curse between
A girl and a boy

These feelings I get, I often wonder why 
So I though I might discuss this, 
Girl, just you and I 
It's not what you wear or 
That I think you're a star
The reason that I like you girl is for 
What you are
If I said I'd think about it, 
You rule my world

So try to understand 
I'm in love girl, in love
I'm so in love girl, in love
I'm just in love girl, in love
And this is true

[CHORUS]

Girl you know it's true 
My love is for you
Girl you know it's true 
My love is for you

Girl you know it 
Yes you know it's 
TRUE!
