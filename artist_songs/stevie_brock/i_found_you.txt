Yeah...
Love found me then
I found You

I woke up from my bed about 7 AM
It was Saturday but I couldn't sleep in
I was up all night
So many things on my mind
Learned a lesson 'bout love
Learned a lot about life
Didn't think I was ready
But you came my way
My first instinct was to run away
Never believed in love at first sight
When I took a second
Look I was frozen in time

No one told me love could sneak
Right up on you
Take over you like an arrow
Going through
I wasn't ready Cupid hit me
Way to soon
Love found me then I found you
All I know is that you took me
By surprise
Couldn't get away 'cause you
Caught my eye
I got you so I know I didn't lose
Love found me then I found you

See I was think 'bout what I like
Cause when it clicks right before my eyes
We could be together
For the rest of our lives
Turn a magic time to an endless night
Love won't ever let us be alone again
Cause love came down heaven sent
To let you slip on by
Just wouldn't be right
Couldn't let you go even if I tried

No one told me love could sneak
Right up on you
Take over you like an arrow
Going through (through going through)
I wasn't ready Cupid hit me
Way to soon
Love found me then I found you
All I know is that you took me
By surprise
Couldn't get away 'cause you
Caught my eye
I got you so I know I didn't lose
Love found me then I found you

No one told me love could sneak
Right up on you (yeah)
Take over you like an arrow
Going through
I wasn't ready Cupid hit me
Way to soon
Love found me then I found you (then I found you)
All I know is that you took me
By surprise
Couldn't get away 'cause you
Caught my eye
I got you so I know I didn't lose
Love found me then I found you

Girl you came along and rescued me
I was thinking love could only happen
In a dream
Now I know it's real I feel it deeply
When I look into your eyes
(I'm hypnotized)
The search is over and forever has begun
I know in my heart that you're
The one I want
Destiny let me right into your arms
And from that day to this day I love
You even more

No one told me love could sneak
Right up on you
Take over you like an arrow
Going through
I wasn't ready Cupid hit me
Way to soon
Love found me then I found you
All I know is that you took me
By surprise
Couldn't get away 'cause you
Caught my eye
I got you so I know I didn't lose
Love found me then I found you

Love found me
Love can sneak right up on you
Like an arrow going through
I found you ( I found you)
Love found me then
I found you

Love found me
It's like living in a dream baby
'Cause you caught my eye
I found you (you)

Love found me then
I found you
