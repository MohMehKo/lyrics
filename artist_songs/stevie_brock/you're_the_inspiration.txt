You know our love was meant to be 
The kind of love that lasts forever
And I want you here with me
From tonight until the end of time 
You should know everywhere I go 
You're always on my mind 
In my heart 
In my soul baby 

[CHORUS]
You're the meaning in my life 
You're the inspiration 
You bring feeling to my life 
You're the inspiration

I wanna have you near me 
I wanna have you hear me saying 
No one needs you more than i need you 

And I know
Yes I know 
That's it's plain to see 
So in love when were together 
Now I know 
That I need you here with me 
From tonight until the end of time 
You should know everywhere I go 
You're always on my mind in my heart in my soul 

[CHORUS]

I want to have you near me
I want to have you hear me saying 
No one needs you more then I need you
Whoa oh oh oh

I want to have you near me
I want to have you near me saying 
No one needs you more then I need you

[CHORUS]

When you love somebody till the end of time 
When you love somebody always on my mind 
No one needs you needs you more than I
When you love somebody till the end of time 
When you love somebody always on my mind
