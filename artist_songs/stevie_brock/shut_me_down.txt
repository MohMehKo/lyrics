Everytime I wanna get next to you

Ya know I'm gonna make it all right

And I know one day

There's no other way, if you 
Shut me down shut me down 
All the time a run around

[CHORUS]

Girl you're the reason I go on
JUst so ya know my feelings are so strong ohoh
But ya know I'm so I'm lost inside
And I'm needing you in my life
But everytime I get so close to you
It seems like I'm wasting my time

[CHORUS]

I hope someday
That I will find another way
Babe
You shut me down shut me down all the time run around

Whatcha gonna do with a girl like me
Dont need to give me lots of material things
I wanna go to the movies,
Hang out with my friends
I wanna stay up late until after ten
You know I might be young
But I know what I like
I got my mind made up
Whos gonna treat me right

He's gotta be down
And if your not my type I'm gonna
Shut you down uuuh
