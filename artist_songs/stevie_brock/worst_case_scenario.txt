If I were to ever lose you
It would be like, fallin in the ocean
It would feel like, I'm stranded in a storm
So lost in time, I would be so lonely
Nothin would do, I only want you
Back in my life, I hope it never happens
That would be the end, of my life girl

If you ever leave me (no no)
Never check me out no more
It be the worse case scenario
Got another crib
Don't know where you live no more (don't know where you live)
It Be the worse case scenario
See you out on the block
Lookin' hot with another guy
That's the worse case scenario (that's the worse case scenario)
My whole life would change
Oooohhh yeah

If you left me, it would surely be
The end of my days, It would bury me
Baby I'd pray every single day,
That your kiss will always be in my life
Hopin' you'll say you feel the same way
Please say yes, I could never lose you
That would be the end, of my life girl

If you ever leave me
Never check me out no more
It be the worse case scenario (whoa)
Got another crib
Don't know where you live no more (and I don't know where you live no more)
It Be the worse case scenario (whoa whoa no no)
See you out on the block
Lookin' hot with another guy
That's the worse case scenario
My whole life would change (my whole life, my whole life would change)

There are some things, (some things)
That you just can't live without
Baby, you are those things (those things) and more
But if it's not meant to be
Then girl, I'd be livin' in misery (misery)
Cause if you love me like I love you then you need me
Don't ever leave me
Hey

See you out on the block
Lookin' hot with another guy
My whole life would change (my whole life would change)
If you ever leave me
Never check me out no more
It be the worse case scenario (that would be, that would be)
Got another crib (ooh you got another crib)
Don't know where you live no more
It Be the worse case scenario
See you out on the block (out on the block, got another guy)
Lookin' hot with another guy
That's the worse case scenario
My whole life would change (would change)

If you ever leave me
No more, no more, no more
Don't know where you live
Don't know where you live
Whoa whoa
