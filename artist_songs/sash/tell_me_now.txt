With a little bit of love (oh, love, oh, love)

Are you lonesome tonight, are you here on your own, can I get your attention?
Saw you dancing here tonight, with a smile that shines so bright, could I hold you tonight?
With a little bit of love, with a little bit of hope, with a little bit of everything
Do you think that's enough?

[Chorus: (2 times)]
Tell me now, is it asking too much, to stay for a while?
'Cos time, precious time, is not on your side.

With a little bit of love

If I could hold you tonight, make you feel alright, gonna take you to heaven,
I miss you being by my side, make me feel alright, take you through the night,
With a little bit of love, with a little bit of hope, with a little bit of everything,
Do you think that's enough?

[Chorus (2 times)]
'Cos time, precious time, is not on your side
