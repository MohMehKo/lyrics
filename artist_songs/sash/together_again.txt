[Chorus]
I don't know where
I don't know how,
But I only know,
That one day,
We'll be together again

And I don't know where,
I don't know how,
But I only know,
That one day,
We'll be together again

It's been a long long time,
Since I left you all alone,
You need to know I had to go,
Far away from you.

I'll walk in this wasted land,
No one to take my hand,
Tell me why you came that way,
I don't know why.

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 (In Danish)]
Siden jeg gik fra dig,
Føles livet lang og hård,
Men jeg tror jeg kommer mig,
for tiden læger sår.

[Verse 2 (English Translation)]
Since I left you,
Life has felt long and hard,
But I think I will get better,
Because I saw early.

Jeg ved ikke hvor,
Ved ikke hvordan,
Men jeg håber kun at du en dag,
Vil være hos mig igen.

I don't know where,
Don't know how,
But I only hope that one day,
You will be with me again.
Nej, Jeg ved ikke hvor,
Ved ikke hvordan,
Men jeg håber kun at du en dag,
Vil være hos mig igen.

No, I don't know where,
Don't know how,
But I only hope that one day,
You will be with me again.

[Chorus]

Don't know where, don't know how,
But I only know,
That we'll be together again.

And I don't know where, (don't know where)
I don't know how, (don't know how)
But I only know,
We'll be together again.
