[Chorus]
Show me the right way!
Show me the right way!
Show me the right way!
Show me the right way!

Walking my way on an endless street, confused and blinded by the light,
On me are spots and a million cars, a nightmare in only black and white,
Have I been there before? I am running in circle, is it real or is it just a dream?
I just want to wake up soon or will this nightmare ever end?

[Chorus (2 times)]

Walking my way on an endless street, confused and blinded by the light,
On me are spots and a million cars, a nightmare in only black and white,
Have I been there before? I am running in circle, is it real or is it just a dream?
I just want to wake up soon or will this nightmare ever end?

[Chorus]
Show me the right way!
Show me the right way!
