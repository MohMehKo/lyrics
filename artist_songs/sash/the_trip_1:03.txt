This is The Trip,
The game that we play,
Looking for meanings,
Drifting away.
Music's my language,
And all I can say,
Is that you are the ride,
That takes me away.

Takes me away [repeat 4 times]

[Chorus]
This is The Trip,
Game that we play,
Looking for meanings,
Drifting away.

Music's my language,
And all I can say,
Is that you are the bomb,
That takes me away.
(Takes me away)

[Verse 2 (In Finnish)]
Henkien,
kultamatkani on,
lauluni voima,
kuolematon,
kerronko sulle - salaisuuden, 

[Verse 2 (English Translation)]
The golden trip of spirits,
The power of my song,
Immortal,
Shall I tell you - a secret? 

Taakse sut kantaa,
se tahtien,
se tahtien. [repeat 4 times]

It takes you away,
Behind the stars
Behind the stars [repeat 4 times]

[Chorus]
