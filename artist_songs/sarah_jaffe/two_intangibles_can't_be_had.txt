I love you in all the dangerous ways
I keep my heart in shape
for your love
as it turns out
I'm a beggar for it
I will exchange for it
all this time you were serious
now it's obvious

It grows
like groves
and it's falling
from your hand

He says to me
"loneliness is universal,
so be happy when you cry"
and yet
I crave to be alone
still I can't be sure

At dusk
I let the light out and it exhales
I let the camera fall
to the floor,
mirror gawking
I'm staring at your face
the things that brought you here
now want you more
