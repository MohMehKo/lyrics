And you wonder why your eyes got sore and wide
It's just the same thing in a different light
When the same thing shows in a different light

Say you know but you ask why
Say you know but you ask why
Say you know but you ask why
Pick it up, do it again

Say you're down to the last line
Say you're down to the last line
Say you're down to the last line
This is for show, do it again

Partly for the hell of it
Solely out of boredom
Mostly for the story
It's where you get your glorified high

Partly for the story
Solely out of boredom
Mostly for the hell of it
It's where you get your glorified high

More than one, hollow, sleepless night
Doctored vision in a different light
Where has all your muscle gone
With all the lies you take on

Say you know but you ask why
Say you know but you ask why
Say you know but you ask why
Pick it up, do it again

Say you're down to the last line
Say you're down to the last line
Say you're down to the last line
This is for show, do it again

Partly for the hell of it
Solely out of boredom
Mostly for the story
It's where you get your glorified high

Partly for the story
Solely out of boredom
Mostly for the hell of it
It's where you get your glorified high
