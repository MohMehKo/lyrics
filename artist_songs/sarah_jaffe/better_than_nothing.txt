How can someone who wants to be loved
hate it when they're loved at all?
Does guilt really feel that bad?
Every time I take a breath, honey
I feel the weight fall back on me
Somebody tell me it's not so bad

Collected thoughts drown in sleep
I had forgotten what you mean to me
I forgot a lot of things

What happens to the old girl, what happens to the boy?
I see their eyelids moving
What happens to the old boy, will he be destroyed?
Is this what I'm losing?
But I feel, feel
But I feel something, oh it's better than nothing

I've been sleeping in his bed
I'm digging in my head
He pulls the cash from under the table
Take that breath and hold it in
Oh it's sidling in, he says
It's not so bad

Collected thoughts drown in sleep
I had forgotten what you mean to me
I forgot a lot of things

What happens to the old girl, what happens to the boy?
I see their eyelids moving
What happens to the old boy, will he be destroyed?
Is this what I'm losing?
But I feel, feel
But I feel something, oh it's better than nothing
