Some dreams make you feel lonely
But only for a moment
Only for a day
And a day is only a fragment

Some memories you will make up
To fill the gaps fate fucked up
As long as you're aware
Of your delusion

That foggy field was our playground
You look like a ghost from far away
You're my bird, I'm your token clown
We'll stay there in that dreamlike state

Some people met in passing
Some words that I said carelessly
Sometimes second chances haunt me
In a moment, in a dream
