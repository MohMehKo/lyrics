For years it would settle there
Til you called it out by name and feared
Nothing but its death was worth your time
And when you came to again
You tore it down on a whim
Always knew the body would win

Alright, alright

In a season's shift your wheels had turned
And you came to me in the afternoon
Your beauty always took me by surprise
In a spell of days I pulled it through
The thread of hope I clung onto
Always knew the body would win

Alright, alright

Though you did not know it yet
Apocalyptic mindset
Like fleeting thoughts that met to say goodbye
The way the sound leaves a room
And leaves the remnants you cling to
A stranger's elation in the night

Alright, alright, alright, alright
