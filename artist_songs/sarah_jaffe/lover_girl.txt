Give me on more smile or I'll steal it from your face
We walk another mile before we reach our sacred place
Give me something to hold onto
Sea of emotion
What's a girl to do, oh, what's a girl to do, oh, what's a girl to do

We're above the hills, we're above the sea
You're like a cup that's full and you spill all over me

I soar like a bird
I float like I'm in space
We're in a lovesick world and I'm your lover girl
I'm your lover girl, I'm your lover girl

Give me one more kiss then I'll lock our lips
Unclench your stubborn fists and I'll put my hands in them

(Give me something)
We're about the hills, we're below the sea
(Give me something)
We're on a barren land but it's bar is its beauty

What's a girl to do, oh
I soar like a bird
I float like I'm in space
We're in a lovesick world and I'm your lover girl

I'm your lover girl
[repeat x4]
