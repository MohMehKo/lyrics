Communication lost
Total disregard
It's not what I paid for

Blue state, red state
Alone in the war
Much to my dismay

Communication lost
Total disregard
It's not what I paid for

Blue state, red state
Alone in the war
Much to my dismay

Shouldn't it be simple either way
Shouldn't it be simple either way

Forget what you came for, it's gone
Uncounted for
Forgetting is easy

Blue state, red state
Alone in the war
In the mess we've made

Shouldn't it be simple either way
Shouldn't it be simple either way

Alone in the war
Forgetting is easy
All that to say, All that to say

Alone in the war
Forgetting is easy
All that to say, All that to say

Communication lost
Total disregard
It's not what I paid for

Blue state, red state
Alone in the war
Much to my dismay
