You're on your way to the bottom
at least you know where you're going
and even when I'm sinking I feel sad
see I never let down and I never let go
guess that means I'm invisible
and all that time I really missed my pride

And I'm living a black hoax
living a black hoax lie
wherever you left me
that's where my heart still lies

Once at night where I reside
I lay there still where I want to cry
and I broke the bed and its matress springs
I told them I'll break the bread
but I'll hog the wine
gather around, it's forgetting time
oh I really miss my pride

I'm living a black hoax
living a black hoax lie
wherever you left me
that's where my heart still lies
wherever you left me
that's where my heart still lies
