I knew my gut reaction was right
In the timeliest fashion
I see you timed it perfectly for worse or for better
But it didn't get the best of me

I'm gonna take it for face value
I know my place without you
You're a bad baby
If nothing else is true
Bab baby
Bad for business too
In fact lately it's everything you do
Bad baby here's looking at you

I wasn't sure about you
After that night
It left a lot in question
And it took all I had in me
The pain and the pleasure
But it didn't get the best of me

I'm gonna take it for face value
I know my place without you
You're a bad baby
If nothing else is true
Bab baby
Bad for business too
In fact lately it's everything you do
Bad baby here's looking at you

You're a bad baby
If nothing else is true
Bab baby
Bad for business too
In fact lately it's everything you do
Bad baby here's looking at you

Bad baby
If nothing else is true
Bab baby
Bad for business too
In fact lately it's everything you do
Bad baby here's looking at you
