Caramel
That's how you stick to me
Your words are soft and sweet and warm
The winter was long and it stayed inside of me
Thinking too much about, thinking too much about myself

Caramel, slow pour
Service me
Kick me out of the bar
Caramel

It's hard to tell
Finish what's left of me
Your words still soft and sweet and warm
The winter long gone but it stayed inside of me
Thinking too much about, thinking too much about myself

Caramel, slow pour
Service me
Kick me out of the bar
