You’re such a baby
It’s just a nose bleed
Leave me for a while
So you can go and cry
Didn’t I say that
You make it up
Twist my words around
Flip them upside down
You cannot stay here
You must go home
It’s nearly 3 o’clock
And now I’m seeing spots

Wake me up just to call me
Sleeping beauty
Oh fine
That’s fine
I got my hands up
I’m feeling vulnerable

One more message
It could not hold
So you go to option B
Drive 20 miles to see me at my worst
And off to work
Think of random things to say
Then leave me for the day

Wake me up just to call me
Sleeping beauty
Oh fine
That’s fine
I got my hands up
I’m feeling vulnerable

All your theories
On why I am
So complex all the time
You try to pick my mind
But what about you
You’re so vague
And everything you tell
Is what keeps me coming back

Wake me up just to call me
Sleeping beauty
Oh fine
That’s fine
I got my hands up
I’m feeling vulnerable
