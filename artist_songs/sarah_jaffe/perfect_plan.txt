Get in my head
go right ahead
fill the body with junk
fill the body with led

oh don't be my old man
let me wrestle with my own ghosts instead
when the smoke meets the sky
we will know by then
we don't need a perfect plan

Get in my head
go right ahead
fill the body with junk
fill the body with led

oh it's weird now I've grown taller
I was so used to laying in bed
now I'm eating grapes from the vine
reading books instead
when we get there we will know
on uncharted land
that we don't need a perfect plan
