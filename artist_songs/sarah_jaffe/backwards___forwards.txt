No, you first
well you brought it up
I'm just swimming in my temptation
my blood my wine

Now I'm having
a whirlwind of a time
confusion is mine I own it
I can never get to you if I'm going...

Back and forth
backwards forwards
back and forth
backwards forwards

Wake up in the twilight
you're a dream in black and blue
you're in between the sky and the ground
and I can never get to you

A dirty compromise
a dirty split in the making
well that's an abyss of a thought
truly no one knows what they've got

(It's always)
Back and forth
backwards forwards
back and forth
backwards forwards

Maybe it's all because I'm not made for it
give me back my brain let me sugarcoat it
all is well when you're lost and then you're found
seriously... it's like moving...

Back and forth
backwards forwards
back and forth
backwards forwards
