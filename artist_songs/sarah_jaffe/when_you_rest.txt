Would have asked me if I didn't tell
For each little mind game, its own separate hell
I believe this is what it's like, that is to say
If you fool yourself at the end of the day
If you fool yourself

Where you gonna rest your head
Where you gonna rest those long legs
Where you gonna rest your head
Where you gonna rest those long legs

Watch you sink to the bottom
But surely it will rise
Like oil and water, it separates right
On your sleeve, there it is
What you've always wanted to say
You long for the day you can pull it together
Pull it together

Where you gonna rest your head
Where you gonna rest those long legs
Where you gonna rest your head
Where you gonna rest those long legs
