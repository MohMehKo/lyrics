In my early twenties
I can't say that now
'Cause I'm nearly thirty
Made it not sure how

But in my early twenties
I started fooling around
Got comfortable being around
Eventually forgot how

I got here in the first place
It's hard to learn from your mistakes
But I wrote a few things down

Hangovers aren't worth it
It takes power to feel worthless

Oh, did David feel like this
Did he give his insides a twist
Before coming up for air

Oh, it's hard to imagine it
What if he had called it quits
Did David feel like this

Looking back, I guess I see it now
Do not have a doubt
That weight gets lost in time

But still, I'm orphaned everyday
Shuffling through the mundane
I want happiness to stay

Hangovers aren't worth it
It takes power to feel worthless

Oh (oh) did David feel like this
Did he get his insides in a twist
Before coming up for air

Oh (oh) it's hard to imagine it
What if he had called it quits
Did David feel like this

Oh (oh) did David feel like this
Did he get his insides in a twist
Before coming up for air

Oh (oh) it's hard to imagine it
What if he had called it quits
Did David feel like this
