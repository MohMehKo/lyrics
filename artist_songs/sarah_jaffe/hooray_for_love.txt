Memories are the finest of flowers
A bridge is all I have to get to you
Fear is what I feed to the cowards
You look like you've had enough

You said nothing is in the telephone wire
You've got nothing to hide
He says torture me, and I'll torture you
If love is forgiveness then I will be forgiven

Hooray for love
Hooray for love
I'm looking up
I'm looking up, but the sky is deceiving

When you're through combining all your powers
You can come and place it in my hands
This may be your finest hour
Can someone teach the baby how to stand?

You said nothing is in the telephone wire
You've got nothing to hide
He says torture me, and I'll torture you
If love is forgiveness then I will be forgiven

Hooray for love
Hooray for love
I'm looking up
I'm looking up, but the sky is deceiving

Hooray for love
Hooray for love
I'm looking up
I'm looking up, but the sky is deceiving
