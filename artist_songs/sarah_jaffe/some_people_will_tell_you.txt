Most people tell you they're different
Most people tell you they're onto something new
Most people try to stay positive
I do what most people do

Most people look for ways out of it
Most people make an excuse
Most people tell you they're over it
I do what most people do

Some people don't have the patience
Some people don't mind the wait
Some people never really grow up
Some people can't act their age
Some people tell you that most will never change

Some will have it figured out
Most will find their way
Some people will tell you most will never change

Some will have it figured out
Most will find their way
Some people ask for honesty
Most people don't like the truth
Most people try to stay positive
I do what most people do

Most people look obvious
Some people look so secure
Most people will tell you that they've found what they're looking for
Some people will tell you that most will never change
Some will have it figured out
Most will find their way
