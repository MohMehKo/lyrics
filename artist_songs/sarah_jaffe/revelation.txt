Revelation scared the hell out of me
As a child, I became obsessive
Hid in the bathroom with a Bible in my hand until I felt relief

Is everything a sign for me
Is everything a sign for me to see
Is everything a sign for me
Is everything a sigh for me to see

Pillar of salt
God and Man
Let the rest fall under circumstance

Pillar of salt
God and Man
Red moon, red moon

A small fixation but I felt it growing
I began to feel outnumbered
By situations and the possibility
I long to feel relief

Is everything a sign for me
Is everything a sign for me to see
Is everything a sign for me
Is everything a sign for me to see

Blood red moon
Constant questions at my feet
Is everything, everything, everything a sign for me
Everything, everything a sign for me
Red moon, red moon, red moon, red moon
Is everything a sign
