You can never know enough about what's underneath
I keep uprooting myself unknowningly
until one day I'm driving and I feel my heart implode
and I wonder where it comes from and where it goes

I guess I have to warn you I might die for a day
and I think about it so much until it finds itself a grave
till we've argued every politic and burned in third degree
I feel like the ghost in your tragedy

You were right, it's easy to see

You found this spot on a wall and you just stared all day
and it felt so comfortable until I made you look away
and your eyes were crossed and glazed and in that moment you lost
maybe it's for the best that you're not here at all

You were right, it's easy to see
Adeline Adeline

I've got your warmth on my back
and your tears in my blood
and whatever it is, it is never enough
until I'm no longer human and you're no longer sane
my face is hard with anger but I want you just the same

You were right, it's easy to see
