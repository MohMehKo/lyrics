Found a cold spot in the water
In the summer
Which was slaughter
And in a way to pull a piss
And oh it's something different
So I got off of the boat,
Jumped into the lazy river
Between jealousy and lust
And made fine incision

Sought to get you off just to let me slide
I make it seems not hard to seem halfway right
And you got there see it from the outside
It's really just a matter of playing the victim right
Right, right
Playing the victim right
Right, right

For the first time in his whole life
I see where doom lies
I lay my palms out right
And we both can instigate
But I know the roads we'll take on
And there's a thousand different ways,
Bear my weakness in your kingdom
Though I think it's fair to say
I'm strong enough to lean on

Things are not the same, not the same, no
Things are not the same, not the same, no

Sought to get you off just to let me slide
I make it seem not hard to seem halfway right
And you got there, see it from the outside
It's really just a matter of playing the victim right
Right, right
Playing the victim right, right, right
Playing the victim right, right, right
Playing the victim right, right, right
Playing the victim right, right, right
