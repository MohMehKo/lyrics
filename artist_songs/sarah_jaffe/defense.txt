Always on the defense
Think it's just my reflex
I don't want want a physical fight
It's not my style

But I'm always on the defense
Gettin' into arguments
I should get away for awhile
Away for awhile

Lookin' for a reason
To provoke my inner demons
Lately they've been fueling my fire
Fueling my fire

But I'm always on the defense
Light some candles, light some incense
I should get away for awhile
Away for awhile

On and off
The struggle, let go
On and off
Don't push the button, man just leave it alone
Don't push the button, man just leave it alone

Having trouble speakin'
Exactly what I'm thinkin'
Lately that's been fueling my fire
Fueling my fire

Not into gettin' even
Resort to heavy drinkin'
I don't want a physical fight
It's not my style

Always on the defense
Think it's just my reflex
I should get away for awhile
Away for awhile

Always on the defense
Soothe it up by confidence
Waitin' for the well to run dry
Well to run dry

On and off
The struggle, let go
On and off
Don't push the button, man just leave it alone
Don't push the button, man just leave it alone
Don't push the button, man just leave it alone
