Here's your chance
I give you what you want
I am a giver
Here's your chance
To tell me what you want
I'm a forgiver

When nobody's around
I try and I take care
I must deliver
When nobody is home
I will knock at the door
I'm a pretender

Here's your chance
I give you what you want
I am a giver
Here's your chance
To tell me what you want
I'm a forgiver

When nobody's around
I try and I take care
I must deliver
When nobody is home
I will knock at the door
I'm a pretender

So, here we stand
Like flowers in the cold wilt and wither
Here's your chance
Tell me what you want
I'm a forgiver
