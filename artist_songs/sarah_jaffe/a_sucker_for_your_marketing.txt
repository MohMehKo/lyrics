Whatever you put out I'm gonna buy it
So what's your latest? I wanna try it
Are you still in love?
Are you over it again?
When the damn thing grows old with no intent
When it's wild to see
Spread its disease
When the comfort grew
To a deepest blue
And the way truth came
On its own time
When it did it came
Before you realized
This was sad
This was sad
This was sad
This was sad
