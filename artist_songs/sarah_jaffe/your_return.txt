Give me a clean slate
Let's take it from the top
Don't drown it in small talk
Let's get to the bottom

Give me the pleasure of knowing you better
Maybe it's not so very long ago
You can move it on a pivot point to your return
When you reach your destination, you'll need time to grow
You can move it on a pivot point to your return

Lost in a moment
I got swept away
Don't drown it in small talk
Let's get to the bottom

Give me the pleasure of knowing you better
Maybe it's a not so very long ago
You can move it on a pivot point to your return
When you reach your destination, you'll need time to grow
You can move it on a pivot point to your return

Give me the pleasure to put it back together
Forgiveness can satisfy
What's lost in a moment can be forgotten
Forgive me
Just let me try

Give me the pleasure to put it back together
Forgiveness can satisfy
What's lost in a moment can be forgotten

Forgive me
Just let me try
Give me a clean slate
Let's take it from the top
Don't drown it in small talk
Let's get to the bottom

Give me the pleasure of knowing you better
Maybe it's not so very long ago
You can move it on a pivot point to your return
When you reach your destination, you'll need time to grow
You can move it on a pivot point to your return
