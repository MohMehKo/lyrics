The body always wins
Took my ignorant luck and divided it up
Put my phony plans in your phony hands
No corrections be made
Not a thing I would change
It's just the way that it is
I gave you my guts, you gave me your limbs
It's just the way that it is

Not epic but colossal
It's not what it says it is
And like a fool it follows
The body always wins

What's the reason, hell if I know
It's what it says it is
Not epic but colossal
The body always wins
