Whatever you put out I'm gonna buy it
So, what's your latest, I wanna try it
Are you still in love, or are you over it again
When the damn thing grew, oh, with no intent

Oh, oh, oh, oh [echoed]

When its wildest seed spread its disease
When the comfort grew to the deepest blue
And the way truth came on its own time
When it did, it came before you realized

Oh, oh, oh, oh [echoed]

This was said, this was said
This was said, this was said
