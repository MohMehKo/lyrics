Pretty soon, I've got to go
But the sooner I leave, the sooner I can come home.
Do you still feel me? 
Don't disconnect
Don't disconnect yet, don't disconnect yet.

Go ahead just ask me, all of the questions, left in your head. 
Don't disconnect
Don't disconnect yet, don't disconnect yet
Don't disconnect yet.

Do you still feel me? 
Do you still feel me?

Do you still feel me?

Pretty soon, I've got to go
But the sooner I leave, the sooner I can come home. 
Do you still feel me?
Don't disconnect
Don't disconnect yet, don't disconnect yet.

Do you still feel me?
Do you still feel me?

Don't disconnect.

Do you still feel me?

Don't disconnect. 

Don't disconnect yet.

Don't disconnect

Don't disconnect yet
Don't disconnect yet.
