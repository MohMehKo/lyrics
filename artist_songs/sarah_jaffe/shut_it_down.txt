Say baby I had to mention
That if you were a star you’d be the one I’m searching for
All the girls they got attention
But I just always feel like they're in need of something you got
Its obvious you’re pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Trying to take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there’s nothing wrong, got this little song
For you to get ready to
Put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody’s taking pictures
Shut it down down down
You would shut it down down down
You be the baddest girl around round round
And they notice they notice
You would shut it down down down
You would shut it down down down
You be the baddest girl around round round
And they notice they notice
You would shut it
What you want
What you need
I can be your everything
And them others
Just wanna hit it but if they had it
Wouldn’t know what to do with it
And together
We shut it down down down
They know we shut it down down down
Your the baddest girl around, round round
They notice, they notice
We shut it down down down
They know we shut it down down down
You'll be the baddest girl around, round round
They notice, they notice
We shut it down down down
They know we shut it down down down
You'll be the baddest girl around, round round
They notice, they notice
And together
You looking good girl
Go go go get em girl,
Go go go hit em girl
Go go go go go go
You looking good girl
Go go go get em girl,
Go go go hit em girl
Go go go go go go
You shut it down
You shut it down
