All my windows are barred
The sun makes us drop a shade
I was sitting round like a zombie
Feeding my own face

I was counting my chi
I was digging my strange
I was taking you for granted
You were holding the reigns

I can hear you louder than ever
Whisper to me, help me remember
I can't see you, but we're still together
I can hear you louder than ever

It's a slippery slope
Like that mousetrap game
Inside my tunnel vision
You stepped on my train

I can hear you louder than ever
Whisper to me, help me remember
I can't see you, but we're still together
I can hear you louder than ever

I don't wanna ignore
You or the past or my feelings
How we gonna get outta this
Just hear me out anyway

Darkness snuck in
Now I'm doubting all my promises
Try and pull me out of this
Just lay down by me and wait

I can hear you louder than ever
Whisper to me, help me remember

I can hear you louder than ever
Whisper to me, help me remember
I can't see you, but we're still together
I can hear you louder than ever
