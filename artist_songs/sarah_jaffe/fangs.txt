She can mean and unkind
The good needs a place to hide
In lonelier times there are fences to climb
And I know

Water to wine
Water to wine
Water to wine
She's got fangs like mine
She's got fangs like mine

When she walks away she plays it off
Don't polish it for me
At the end of every kiss there's a war
And I know

Water to wine
Water to wine
Water to wine
She's got fangs like mine
She's got fangs like mine
She's got fangs like mine
