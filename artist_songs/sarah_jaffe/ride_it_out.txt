Middle of the line, middle of the road
Nowhere to hide on this logical plateau

Running out of money
Reaping what I sew
Nowhere to hide on this logical plateau

Gonna have to
Ride it out
Ride it out
Ride it out
Ride it out
[repeat]

Burst of emotion follows mid-day lull
Nowhere to hide on this logical plateau

Updating my status
Reaping what I sew
Nowhere to hid on this logical plateau

Ride it out
Ride it out
Ride it out
Ride it out
[repeat]

Middle of the line, middle of the road
Nowhere to hide
Nowhere
[repeat]

Ride it out
Ride it out
Ride it out
Ride it out
[repeat]

Middle of the line, middle of the road
Nowhere to hide
Nowhere
