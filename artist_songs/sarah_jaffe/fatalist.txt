These are the same thoughts that I had yesterday
Oh lady, lady
Creature of habit
Then swiftly becomes it

Either we'll die, we'll die, we'll die, we'll die
Without a conscience
Either we'll die, we'll die, we'll die, we'll die
From the obvious

Put me to shame
Put me in my place
Oh lady, lady
Creature of habit
Then swiftly becomes it

Either we'll die, we'll die, we'll die, we'll die
Without a conscience
Either we'll die, we'll die, we'll die, we'll die
From the obvious
