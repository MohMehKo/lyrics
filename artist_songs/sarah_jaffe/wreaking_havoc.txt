You plus one
me plus none
like a bag of bones
drag my ass back home

You do it just to spite
you know it makes me cry
I know it makes you cry
melodramatic lie

We're wreaking havoc
let's give your problems a name
we both like pain

When you break my heart
when the crow picks me apart
when my shadow starts to bleed
or my brain doesn't feel the need

You know you're just in time
in through the yellow light
a cinematic view
I think you're mental too

We're wreaking havoc
and we're both to blame
we both like pain
