Life like a b-side, a medicated verse
Fall in the frontline, and back to Middle earth
Mannequin woman, can't set myself in motion
Feel the blood pumping but cannot find a pulse

Oh I just don't, just don't know, know, know
[Repeat]

Spent a month to be quiet, a few days to be cool
My friends were my counselors, and they told me what to do
There's always a point, a point of no return
Always something to give up
Always something to learn

Send my brain in circles, she'd my bitter skin
Still a mannequin woman
Can't set myself in motion

Oh I just don't, just don't know, know, know
[Repeat]

Just don't know [repeat]
