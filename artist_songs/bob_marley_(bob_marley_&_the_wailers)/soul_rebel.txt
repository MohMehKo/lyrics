I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer

See the morning sun
On the hillside
Not living good, yeah! Travel wide
Said, I'm a living man
I've got work to do
If you're not happy, children
Then you must be blue
(Must be blue, must be blue) people say

I'm a rebel, let them talk,
Soul rebel, talk won't bother me.
I'm a capturer, that's what they say,
Soul adventurer, night and day.

I'm a rebel, soul rebel
Do you hear them lippy?
I'm a capturer, gossip around the corner,
Soul adventurer. How they adventure on me

But see a morning sun
On the hillside
Not living good, travel wide
Said, I'm a living man
I've got work to do
If you're not happy, you must be blue

I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer
Do you hear me?
I'm a rebel, rebel in the morning
Soul rebel, rebel at midday time
