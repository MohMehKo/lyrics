Bass is heavy, drummer is steady
In this situation we need some kinda protection
So don't get panicky and run in the wrong direction
Jah made man to rule his destiny
The sacred values of the law of humanity

The tension builds, the energy grow
Riddim runs and I got you on the floor
Cryin out for more
Cause that's the only way we gonna know for sure
You need some more
So, free your souls and let your spirit go
Wherever you go
