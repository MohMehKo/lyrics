Yeah
Well, you can go from Maine to Mexico
From Detroit City to D.C. yeah
I've been loving you much too, too, too long girl
To let you get away from me, yeah
You know my mind says I'm to let her go
But my poor heart just won't let me
He said you're fighting it hard
Baby please gets smart
What will you bet me?
Will you ever bet me?

I'm gonna get you, baby baby
Hear what I say,

Hear what I say,

I'm gonna sit down and think up
A new technique
And this time I sure it won't fail
Though you're trying so hard
I can understand
You're giving in
I can tell by by by your hesitation on the telephone
Where before it was simply a no
And you're curious now, baby some way somehow

I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna get,
I'm gonna gonna get you
Baby baby baby, you see
I'm gonna gonna get you, baby now,
Hear what I say

'Cause I need you
Hear what I say
I need you every minute, need you every minute
Need you every minute
