Oh-a-w-oh 
When I was just a little child
(little child)
Happiness was there awhile
(there awhile)
And from me, it...
It slipped one day (ay)
Happiness
Come back I say

Cause if you don't come
I've got to go looking...
For happiness

Well if you don't come
I've got to go looking...
God, for happiness... happiness

Say that
Say I'm hurting
(inside) and its no...
I'm hurting 
I'm hurting 
Deep inside

Oh good god now

Oh hear my cry
Hear my cry
Yeah my my my my my my my cry

Been together like school children
(school children)
Then you hurt me just in vain
(just in vain)
Oh... 
Lord, I'm your little child
(little child)
Oh
Happiness come back awhile

Cause if you don't come
I'm go'ng a looking
For happiness
The road is dangerous

Cause if you don't come
I've got to go looking
For happiness...happiness

Said I'm...
Don't you know I'm...
I'm hurting, hurting inside

Oh I'm hurting

Who cares 
Who cares

Does the one who love 
Oh
Feel the pain
Feel the pain

Does the one who love 
Feel the pain
Feel the pain

(been together)
Been together like school children
