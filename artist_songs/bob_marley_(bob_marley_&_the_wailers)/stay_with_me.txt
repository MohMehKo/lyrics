Down on my knees
Beggin' you please
Stay with me
Stay with me
Have I done you so wrong girl
Won't you stay with me
I pray each night
With tears in eyes
I pray this time I can keep something good
And if my prayers are answered
We'll be happy like we should
You can stop your tears from fallin'
Can't you hear my heart a callin' you stay
Why should lovers' quarrel and a bicker
Why let foolish pride stand in our way, oooh
