All will be revealed before the next move
All will be revealed before the next move

Gimme some juice and let me blow
Tell that joker where to go
Gimme some air and let me breathe
Wake me when it's time to leave

I was a Beatnik

A shark tooth fin and a Chevrolet
A wild boy takes it all the way
No more Charlie it's my throat
Send the bell-boy for my coat

I was a Beatnik
All will be revealed before the next move
All will be revealed before the next move

I got to see you one more time
Show you to a friend of mine
Poor white man on an asian beat
An exis kid with a graceful streak

I was a Beatnik
No more from Charlie
No more from Cole
No more expresso
I was a Beatnik
All will be revealed before the next move
All will be revealed before the next move

No more expresso...
