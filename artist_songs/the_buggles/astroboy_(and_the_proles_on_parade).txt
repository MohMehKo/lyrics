All of those wild American bilinguals
Who'll talk to you in Paris of their lonely lives
School days and last days out there in the Midwest
They climb on the liners to rejoin their wives

Walking down boulevards electric eyes
Would gaze at the waveforms and gasp at their size
Let them be lonely and say you don't care

Astroboy... (I'm watching the proles on parade)
Astroboy... (I'm watching the proles on parade)

Ulla with blond hair
Would stand by your side
And the friends who were hungry
Could swallow your pride
Chromium headsets, their video screens
Would show pictures of helplessness
Old kings and queens

Radio stations that fade as in dust
All their transmitters are crumbling with rust
Let them be broken and say you don't care

Astroboy... (I'm watching the proles on parade)
Astroboy... (I'm watching the proles on parade)
Astroboy... (I'm watching the proles on parade)
Let them be broken and say you don't care
Astroboy... (I'm watching the proles on parade)
