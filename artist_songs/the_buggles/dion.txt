Tell me how we’ve come so far, Dion
I see it in your eyes, the love has gone
When we have modern times like these,
It's hard to keep a grip on what is real, Dion

Hand to mouth and mouth to hand we feed
No one there to monitor the need
Could it be timelessness,
Or just a way to say there is no other time, Dion?

All of their eyes were neon, only the lies were true
I can remember Dion, how they laughed at you!
Alone as the sunlight made them, the loneliest point of view
I can remember Dion, that’s how I will think of you

Take a room and walk along the shore
Down to places you have known before
Out in the morning air
Where you could always be alone and watch the sea, Dion

All of their eyes were neon, only the lies were true
I can remember Dion, how they laughed at you!
Alone as the sunlight made them, the loneliest point of view
I can remember Dion, that’s how I will think of you

Tell me how we’ve come so far, Dion
I see it in your eyes that love has gone
When we have modern times like these
It’s hard to keep a grip on what is real, Dion

I can remember Dion
I can remember Dion
I can remember Dion, only the lies were true
I can remember Dion, how they all laughed at you
I can remember Dion, ah...

I can remember Dion, ah...
