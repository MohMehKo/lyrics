And if the ground staff must be seen to be believed
There's no one sleeping - no one awake
And if the engines must be started in the night
There will be silence, no last intake
Of air that cools in a cloud as we breathe
Too late for even the night planes to leave
In a broken run
They always come
And they fly from here...

I want to be the one who always gives you shelter
Finds a way to keep you warm
And if some fool should say there is no other answer
It's a caution to face the dawn
Alone - so cool like the air that we breathe
Too late for even the night planes to leave
In a broken run
They always come
And they fly from here...
