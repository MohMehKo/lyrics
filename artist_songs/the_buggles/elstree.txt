Action!

I had a dream on a back lot
And saw my life like a long shot
Of smiling faces in a picture parade
Of all the stills from the films that you made
That we would see in the Essoldo
After drinking coffee at the (G.O. condo? Giocondo?)

Elstree, remember me?
I had a part in a B movie
I played a man from history
Elstree, I look at me
Now I work for the BBC
Life is not what it used to be

I took no dives in the fight scene
I had a stuntman keep my suit clean
There's no technology to fake up a song
They stop the orchestra if you get it wrong

Elstree, remember me?
I had a part in a B movie
I played a man from history
Elstree, I look at me
Now I work for the BBC
Life is not what it used to be

Elstree

They made a field into a war zone
I beat the enemy on my own
All the bullets just went over my head
There's no reality and no one dead in

Elstree, remember me?
I had a part in a B movie
I played a man from history

Elstree
Elstree
Elstree
Elstree
Elstree

Cut!
