My heart is an alligator
Better watch your step - watch your step
This heat is an incubator
Make a diamond sweat - wanna bet
Live life like you're flying solo
Never in the net - in the net

Dancing in silence the orchestra late
In the Essoldo or down by the lake
I don't care

Take me to Vermilion Sands
Hold me in familiar hands
Take me to Vermilion Sands

Sandyacht on a thermal roller
We were never there - never there
Live life like you're flying solo
Never in the air - in the air

Dancing in silence the orchestra late
In the Essoldo or down by the lake
I don't care

Take me to Vermilion Sands
Hold me in familiar hands
Take me to Vermilion Sands

My heart is an alligator
Better watch your step - watch your step
This heat is an incubator
Make a diamond sweat - wanna bet

Take me to Vermilion Sands
Hold me in familiar hands
Take me to Vermilion Sands
