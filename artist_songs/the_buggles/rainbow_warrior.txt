Run
Run for shelter
Hide from the wind
Further on
We may help you
In the end

Sun
Sun as always
Will guard where you lay
And the walls are down
And the waters drown
Where you stay

Waiting
Waiting
Waiting for the Rainbow Warrior

So
Son of logic
Boy born of light
Is the picture drawn
Is the harvest one
Step away

Waiting
Waiting
Waiting for the Rainbow Warrior
