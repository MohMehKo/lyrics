Memories
How they fade so fast
Look back
There is no escape
Tied down
Now you see too late
Lovers
They will never wait

I am a camera (I am a camera)
Camera, camera
I am a camera  (I am a camera)
Camera, camera

There
By the waterside
Here
Where the lens is wide
You and me
By the sea
Taken in tranquility

Take heart
I will never let you go
If you
Only let your feelings show
Lovers all
How you never broke your hearts
You lose them
When the feeling starts

(I am a camera)
(I am a camera)
(A camera)
I am a camera
I am a camera

(I am a camera)
(I am a camera)
(A camera)
I am a camera
I am a camera

(I am a camera)
(I am a camera)
(A camera)
A camera, camera, camera, camera

(I am a camera)
(I am a camera)
(A camera)
A camera!

There
By the waterside
Here
Where the lens is wide
You and me
By the sea
