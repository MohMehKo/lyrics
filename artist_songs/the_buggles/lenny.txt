Lenny!
Lenny!

All the fools who await your return
May we tell them the truth
There's no way you can turn back the clock
Never cling to your youth (Lenny!)

How unfortunate it must have been
Life is only a race (Lenny!)
You're so old that it might take a crane
Just to lift back your face

Scientific, so scientific
Scientific, so scientific
But you were walking on glass

Lenny!

How unstable we bolt with the horse
Setting music to muscle
And the fallers will litter the course
As we run to the castle

Scientific, so scientific
Scientific, so scientific
But you were walking on glass

Careful
You're walking on glass
You're walking on glass

Careful
You're walking on glass

(He said the sun doesn't move)
When you say that the sun does not move
Did it show you the answer?
When the ships do not fall off the world
Does it mean there's a wall there?

(He said the sun doesn't move)
Careful
He could be walking on glass

He could see that the earth was a mover
But the sun was a mother
He could see that the earth was a mover
But the sun was a mother

But he was walking on glass
