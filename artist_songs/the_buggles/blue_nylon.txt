Sing!
Nylon, sing for me
Make it blue
Make it blue

Know!
The love to bring to you
So I must sing to you
All in blue
All in blue

In blue
Blue nylon, blue
Blue nylon, blue
Blue nylon, blue

Ring!
Ring a ring for me
Say it's true
Say it's true

In blue
Blue nylon, blue
Blue nylon, blue
Blue nylon, blue

Sing!
Nylon, sing for me
Make it blue
Make it blue
