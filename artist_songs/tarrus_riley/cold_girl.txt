[Chorus:]
Hey you stepping out on your own
Got a heart made of stone
Such a cold, cold, girl
And what will my story be
Is there a future for me
Chad yo cold, cold, world

[Verse 1:]
Well I herd but I could not believe it
You were out all night on the town
I would call your phone
Home alone
And you were no where around
I would wait like a child on his birthday
All my waiting was in vane
Broke my heart baby
The day you gone left me
And if you never needed my love
Why didn't you say so
And if you wanted someone to play wid
Why didn't you let me know
Instead of walking out the door

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
If I had Only listen
Wouldn't lose focus on my mission
You weren't gold but you were glisten
Gave you my all and now you dissing
Now I'm wishing I never met you
And wondering how could I have let you
Get the best of me now I regret you
And even tho I try I can't forget you

If all you wanted was someone to play wid
Why didn't you say so
And if you never needed my love
Why didn't you let me know
Instead of walking out the door

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
No one told me love would hurt so
And woman I can't believe you
Open my heart, pure out my feelings
Drop mu guard and let you in
I was true but you deceive me
All for you, why you mislead mi
Broke my heart baby
The day you gone and leave me

And if you never needed my love
Why didn't you say so
If you wanted someone to play with
Why didn't you let me know
Instead of walking, walking

[Chorus x2]
