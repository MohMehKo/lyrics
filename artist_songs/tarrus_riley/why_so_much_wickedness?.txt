I woke up this morning, feel a burning fire inside, oh yeah
And some people say, that I'm crazy, losing my mind
But look in my head and you'll see everything that I've been through
You can look in my head
And you'll see everything that I've been through

Woke up this morning, everyone knew something was wrong, oh
I guess you can say, finally tired of being stepped on
Look in my eyes and you'll see all the tears that I've cried
If you look in my life
Then you'll see all the fights that I've survived

So tell me why so much wickedness out there
Tell me why so much wickedness out there
Tell me why so much wickedness out there
Tell me why..

I tell you this morning, I feel like running away
I guess you can say, I'm finally tired of the hypocrisy
'Cause when I look at the news, and-a listen the views of the masses
Writings there on the wall, and the leaders we call, they have no clue

Tell you this morning, I feel like staying inside, oh yes
The way things are going, me better off inna exile
When I look outside, tears in my eye, I cry
And I can't live a lie, sufferation I see, in all times

And tell me why so much wickedness out there
Tell me why so much wickedness out there
Tell me why so much wickedness out there
Tell me why..

Hey look in my head and you'll see everything that I've been through
If you can look in my head
Then you'll see everything that I've been through

Tell me why so much wickedness out there
Tell me why so much wickedness out there
Tell me why so much wickedness out there
Tell me why..

Tell me why so much wickedness out there
Tell me why so much wickedness out there
Tell me why so much wickedness out there
Tell me why..

Tell me why so much wickedness out there
And why so much wickedness out there
Tell me why so much wickedness out there
Tell me why..
