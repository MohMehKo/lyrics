[Intro:]
Woman of ma dreams
Mi wonder if mi a go meet you in reality
Baby
Woman of my dreams
Mi wonder if mi a go meet you in reality
Tired fi see you in my sleep

[Chorus:]
Searching, waiting, hoping and praying
Where is the lady for me
Searching, waiting, hoping and praying
Where is the lady for me

[Verse 1:]
A no any type or any kind a woman out a road cyan be my girl
Nah stero type mi nah hype
It take a special kind to be my girl
If shi physically right shi wi catch yo right
Shi intellectual yo know di mind right
And dem yah kind a woman no easy fi find
Am putting time to find my girl

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Why should I be sitting and watching
Lovers in the park everybody happy
Wooh am in need of loving
Wooh am missing out on something
And when will she come to me
Will I solve my love mystery
Wooh am in need of loving
Wooh am missing out on something

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Oh wooh when will I find this right
Will it take a life time
I don't mind
Heeey when will I find this right
I know she out there
Know she out there
Yea yea

[Chorus]
