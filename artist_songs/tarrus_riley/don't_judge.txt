You see him on the streets, he's always there
No one has ever heard him speak
Although he'll stare
Soon, very soon he'll open in his mouth
And you'll be surprised of the words that come out
He might be a father that you turned your back on
Or your brother that haven't seen in so long

You see him on the streets with rats for clothes
How did he end up in on them streets
No one knows where he is from or what is about
But you'd be surprised if he should open his mouth
He might be a prophet, that you read of in book
Or your saviour, despite how he looks

So don't you ever jump to judge
Don't you ever jump to judge
Looks may be deceiving, but every man's got their meaning
I can tell you, you might end up in his shoes
On the corner, singing the blues

Don't you ever jump to judge
Look beyond the cover of before you jump to judge
Looks may be deceiving, every man's got their meaning
He might be a father that you turned your back on
Or your brother that your finger's point on

The woman in the street that you pass by
Is somebody's daughter, somebody's wife
I can't blind my eyes, I'm crying inside
People criticize who stereotype
Might be a mother that you turned your back on
Or your sister that your finger's point on

We are the people of the streets, we all are one
No matter how you see it, a one nation
And soon very soon, we've got to be strong
And look beyond this mass confusion

It might be creation that you turned your back on
Or your heaven, the way [?]
So don't you ever jump to judge
Look beyond the cover, don't jump to judge
Looks may be deceiving, every one's got their meaning

So don't you ever jump to judge
Look beyond the cover before you jump to judge
Looks may be deceiving, every one's got their meaning
