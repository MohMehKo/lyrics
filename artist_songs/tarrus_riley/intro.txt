We got a love situation (ooh aah)
You say you love me (ooh aah)
But do you really love me (ooh aah)
Or how I make you feel (ooh aah)
Another love situation (ooh aah)
Has hurt me (ooh aah)
I refuse to give up on her loving (ooh aah)
Though I've been called a fool (ooh aah)

Season change (ooh aah)
Comes with the game (ooh aah)
After I give you my heart, how will I know you'll stay?

I don't wanna be comfortable or too relaxed
So won't you give me the facts
I don't wanna be lost here in a trap
Then like the movies that's rap (ooh aah)

Is this love or a situation (ooh aah)
I really hope it lasts (ooh aah)
Are you here for a moment (ooh aah)
Like relationships past (ooh aah)
Hey, love situation (ooh aah)
Hope we never fade (ooh aah)
We can grow old together (ooh aah)
And spend the rest of our days (ooh aah)

Season change (ooh aah)
It comes with the game (ooh aah)
After I give you my everything, how will I know you'll stay?

I don't wanna be comfortable or too relaxed
So won't you give me the facts
I don't wanna be lost here in a trap
Then like the movies that's rap

I don't wanna be comfortable or too relaxed
Can you give me the facts
I don't wanna be lost here in a trap
Then like the movies that's rap
