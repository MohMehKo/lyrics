Adios mi amor,
If you walk out through the door
Goodbye, my love,
I won't take it anymore
Adios mi amor.
Rvssian, she tek me for a joke

If you feel like you have me wrapped up around your little finger
You're wrong
And everybody feel as if a you lick mi chip
And I'm programmed to you
Think-a you alone can love me
And I'll be broken if you walk out

But anytime
You decide
Fi pack up your things and leave

Don't come back
One, go
Don't come back
I won't cry
I'll be fine
Don't come back
Anytime you're ready
When you're ready
You're free to go
Don't come back

Nuh bother meck the door reach you
When the good lord split you
Don't come back

Roses are red,
But life is real
This love is gone toxic
And ah poison we
No need to play any games anymore
Your kind of loving ain't loving to me
Drifting oh we're drifting out to sea
Remember when we were one
This ship is sinking
If we tumble out we're gonna drown
My cup is overflowing
I've had enough now

So anytime
You decide
Fi pack up your things and leave

Don't come back
One, go
Don't come back
I won't cry
I'll be fine
Don't come back
Anytime you're ready
When you're ready
You're free to go
Don't come back

If you feel like you have me wrapped up around your little finger
You're wrong
And everybody feel as if a you lick mi chip
And I'm programmed to you
Girl, you alone can love me
And I'll be broken if you walk out
Pack up your things and leave

Don't come back
One, go
Don't come back
I won't cry
I'll be fine
Don't come back
