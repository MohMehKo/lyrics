[Intro]
Yeah heeey 

[Verse 1]
We've been together for a while now 
Growing stronger everyday now 
Feel so good and there is no doubt 
I will stay with you 
As each morning brings the sun rise 
And the flowers bloom in spring time 
On my loving you can rely 
I will stay with you 

[Chorus]
Oh I will stay with you 
Through your ups and your downs 
I will stay with you 
With no one else is round 
When the dark clouds away 
I will stay by your side 
And I know will be all right 
I will stay with you 

[Verse 2]
Though relationships get old 
And have the tendency to grow cold 
We've got something like a miracle 
I will stay with you 

[Chorus]
Oh I will stay with you 
Through your ups and your downs 
I will stay with you 
With no one else is round 
And when the dark clouds away 
I will stay by your side 
And I know will be all right 
I will stay with you 

[Verse 3]
There'll be heartaches and pain yeah 
Though it all 
We'll remain 
In this life we all know 
Friends they come 
Friends they go 
But through the years I know I will stay 
And in the end we'll find 
Love so beautiful and divine 
We'll be lovers for a lifetime I will stay with you 

[Chorus]
Oh I will stay with you 
Through your ups and your downs 
I will stay with you 
With no one else is round 
When the dark clouds away 
I will stay by your side 
And I know will be all right 
I will stay with you 
Oh I will stay with you 
Through your ups and your downs 
I will stay with you 
With no one else is round 
When the dark clouds away 
I will stay by your side 
And I know will be all right 
I will stay with you
