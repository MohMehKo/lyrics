Dada daa-da da-daa
Dada daa-da da-da-daa

She says her hearts been broken, 
Too many times
So now she keeps her guard up
She's got to play tough
I tell her to let me in
She hesitates, she's afraid 
She says the last time she's been there
Is soso heartache, yea

And everytime she gives her heart
All she gets back is broken pieces
Everytime she opens up 
All she gets back is disappointment
We've got to pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces yea, oh 
We've got to pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces yea, mm

Cause every broken heart (oooh) 
Can be mended
And every sad situation (oooh-oooh)
We all get hurt in
We've got to pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces yea,
We've got to pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces yea, yea

Dada daa-da da-daa (pick them up)
Dada daa-da da-da-daa (pick them up)

I said my hearts been broken 
So i know, how it feels 

Its just like a raw deal, where you've been cut short, yea
See there is nothing like real love,
And for that you have to chance
Its above all costs
Its priceless
So priceless

And every time you give your heart,
All you get back is broken pieces 
And every time you open up
All you get back is disappointment

We've got to pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces yea,
We've got to pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces yea, mm

Cause every broken heart 
Can be mended
And every sad situation
We all get hurt in
We've got to pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces yea, oh
We've got to pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces yea, yea

Cause every broken heart 
Can be mended
And every sad situation
We all get hurt in
We've got to pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces yea,
We've got to pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces yea, yea
