We don’t give trouble

Tun up the music caw we no response
Music a play from cross the distance

Do your own thing, be your king youth

Dem shoes still cyaa walk like you

Way up, up wi deh
No bad mind cyaa hold wi down

Face brush, teeth wash
Half pound a greens in a my calabash
Sunlight a peep through the window crack
A beautiful day suh mi a go fi the pot

And things nice
Step in the street am greeting wid smile
There’s no time for bad vibes no

When yuh sit down and you cursing
Have yuh every count yo blessings
Mi nuh dem do that none at all hi nuh
And while yo deh, deh, criticizing
Have you ever learn a lesson
Hear wa? Dem head tough like a wall hi no
And mi couldn’t follow people

Hey Chimney mi family tell dem fi follow we
Mi brother Tarrus Riley hum a rep the SMG
And wi come fi lock the whole country
Suh when yo si wi yo fi
