Speechless, no matter how I try
Speechless, ooh, ooh
Speechless, no matter how I try
I am speechless, ooh, listen

I can't deny the love I feel for you
No matter how hard I try, ooh-ooh, cha
And in the night my arms reach out to you
I need-a you by my side, ooh-ooh

There I play up in your love, was the sweetest feeling
You're all that I'm thinking of
You bring the Rastaman healing
Your loving shines like the rising of the dawn
Your body speaks to me
The way you move and gwaan

Speechless, the rhythm in my heart
Speechless, loving your voice
Like sweet melody when you talk
Speechless, music in every word
Is the sweetest song I ever heard
Speechless, at time my love gets heard
And I get lost for words

Your tender touch is what my hearts beats for
Each and every day, ooh, ooh, huh
Your smile it shines so bright
No matter where you are
It always lights my way, ooh

You know just what to do
You always make me feel right
I know that your love is true
I never have to think twice
Your loving shines like the rising of the dawn
Your body speaks to me
The way you move and gwaan

Speechless, the rhythm in my heart
Speechless, loving your voice
Like sweet melody when you talk
Speechless, music in every word
Is the sweetest song I ever heard
Speechless, at time my love gets heard
And I get lost for words

Oh, yes baby, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, listen

Can't find no words, don't even talk
Oh, I feel it heart to heart
When you're around, looking my way
I don't know just what to say

Speechless, no matter how hard I try
Speechless, ah, baby
I'm speechless, no matter how hard I try
I'm speechless, ooh, ooh, huh
Speechless, speech, ah.. I mumble..
Speechless..

Stt-stt-sttotter, uh huh
A long-long-long-long time me-me-
Me like, me like you
What happen to you man? Cha, ha-ha

A stt-stt-sttotter, ooh, stt-stt-sttotter
I can't get upon the wo-wo-words to tell you, baby
