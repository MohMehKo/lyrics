The man who thinks he's larger than life
He doesn't even knows how he came in existance
The man who thinks he's larger than life
He doesn't even know how he's soul is surviving

He doesn't know
When he came or when he'll go
he doesn't care
and he thinks he's got things figured out

But when the lightning strike everybody run
lightning strike everybody run
lightning striking
Thunder rouring

The man who thinks he's larger than life
he doesn't even know how he came in existance
And all your intelects in high praises
you better remember take time out and devices

No you don't know when you came or when you'll go
You don't know
And you think got things figured out

when JahJah lightning striking everybody run
Lightning strike everybody run
Lightning striking
thunder rouring

Can't run can't hide from the lightning
even the strongest get frightned
can't run can't hide from the lightning
even the strongest get frightned

For you don't know
when you came or when you'll go
you don't know
think you've got things figured out

But when the lightning strike everybody run
lightning strike everybody run
lightning striking
Thunder rouring

The man who thinks he's larger than life
he doesn't even know how he came in existance

And all your intelects in high praises
you better remember take time out and devices
he'll never know
he never know
he'll never cares
and all the lightning striking
they're all running
lightning striking
they're all frightned.....
