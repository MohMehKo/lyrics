No tears [?] again
No tears just friends
They say I don't know
What you've got to let's go on
But since my break up with you
What they say might not be true
Say I don't know
What you got till it's lost
I'm not longer wake up with you 
And I'm feelin brand new
No more fighting
I've tried, it didn't work
Thats life
Hope you doing well without me
I'm doing fine without you
Hope you doing better without me
I'm doing great without you 
Guess what?
I'm not missing you
Ever since the split
I feel like the weight has lifted
But I must admit
That getting over you wasn't easy
You were always say
I regret the day
You walk out on me
And I'll be sorry
Hope you doing well without me
I'm doing fine without you
Hope you doing better  without me 
I'm doing great without you
Guess what?
I'm not missing you
Never been one to burn a reason acrossed
The relationship wouldn't sail
And we were going nowhere 
Fast
Now you wondering
If is gain or a loss
But I never had a second force
I never since we both had
No more quarrels 
I've tried it didn't work
Thats life
So hope you're doing well without me
Cause I'm doing fine without you
Hope you're doing better without me
I'm doing great without you
Guess what?
I'm not missing you
I'm not missing you
I'm not missing you
Girl
I'm not missing you
Lady
They say I don't know
What you've got till is gone
But since my break up with you
What they say might not be true
They say I don't know
What you got till is lost
I'm not longer wake up with you 
And  I'm feel in brand new
No more fighting
I've tried, it didn't work
Thats life
So hope you doing well without me
Cause I'm doing fine without you
Hope you doing better without me
I'm doing great without you 
Guess what?
I'm not missing you
I'm not missing you
I'm not missing you, believe it
I'm not missing you over you babe
I'm not missing you
