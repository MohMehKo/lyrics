Shane, how she look so?
Dark glasses, a nuh she
And how she a walk so?
Yuh know seh mi a go ask har

Hey there, what's wrong woman?
Looks like your feeling down inside
He says he loves you but him a beat you
When him feel like and it's not right
A weh him really feel like?

How him fi beat, beat yuh den waan tek yuh clothes off
Abuse and mistreat yuh den later on seduce yuh
Mek him know him nah get nuh loving if a so den star
Di strength weh him a tek beat tek it go fight war
Face too pretty fi a wear scar
He'll never get to Zion if him a break yuh heart

Cut it off, let it go, start anew
Cut it off and find someone who love you, girl
Cut it off, life too short
Cut it off, nuh 'fraid to start over
Cut it off, a so how the healing start

You know it's not right, whole heap of fuss and fight
Him waan thump you inna yuh eye mum
It a raw waan lie down

You know it's not right, inna di most high sight
And there is nothing domestic about it
My girl a betta yuh low it

How him fi beat, beat yuh den waan tek yuh clothes off
Abuse and mistreat yuh den later on seduce yuh
Mek him know him nah get nuh loving if a so den star
Di strength weh him a tek beat tek it go fight war
Face too pretty fi a wear scar
He'll never get to Zion if him a break yuh heart

You've got to love yourself but you love someone
Never you hurt your flesh in the name of love, no
You've got to love yourself but you love someone
Never you hurt your flesh in the name of love, no

How him fi beat, beat yuh den waan tek yuh clothes off
Abuse and mistreat yuh den later on seduce yuh
Mek him know him nah get nuh loving if a so den star
Di strength weh him a tek beat tek it go fight war
Face too pretty fi a wear scar
He'll never get to Zion if him a break yuh heart

It's not right, cho, whole heap of fuss and fight
Inna di most high sight
And there's nothing domestic about it

How him fi beat, beat yuh den waan tek yuh clothes off
Abuse and mistreat yuh den later on seduce yuh
Mek him know him nah get nuh loving if a so den star
Di strength weh him a tek beat tek it go fight war
Face too pretty fi a wear scar
He'll never get to Zion if him a break yuh heart

Cut it off, let it go, start anew
Cut it off and find someone who love you, girl
Cut it off, life too short
Cut it off, nuh 'fraid to start over
Cut it off, a so how the healing start

Caan mek him hurt yuh no more
Dat man a beat, beat yuh den waan tek yuh clothes off
Abuse and mistreat yuh an den waan misuse yuh
