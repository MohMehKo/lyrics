If you search for tenderness its not hard to find
You can have the love you need to live
But if you search for truthfulness
You might as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give

Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
Mostly what I need from you

I can always find someone
Who say they simpathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeves
I dont need some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
All I need is someone to believeee

Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
Mostly what I need from you

I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can match security until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me
Promise is a plage
I know..I know..I knooowooo

When am deep inside myself
Dont be too concern
I wont ask for nothing when am gone
But when I want some sanity
Tell me where else can I turn
Cause you are the one I depend oooonnnn

Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
Mostly what I need from you

Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
Mostly what I need from you

All I need from you is honesty
All I need from you is honesty

Honesty is all I need from you..
