Devil's appetite open wider
Belly of the beast getting larger

So many things to distract you from Jah
How many soldiers will fall short
Shots all around, hope you know that my friend
And in him you can depend

Oh, the devil's appetite open wider
The belly of the beast is getting larger
Don't be careless now, he'll devour you
And chances are you won't recover, noooo

Tell me who can stand it
Tell me who can stand it
Failing to yield to the devil is hard
Falling a victim is so common

Don't let your heart be tempted beyond
Fire you can't recover from
Cause the devil's appetite open wider, ahh
belly of the beast is getting larger, uhh
Don't be careless now, he'll devour you
And chances are you won't recover, noooo

Tell me who can stand it
Tell me who can stand it
Tell me who can stand it
Tell me who can stand it

So many things to distract you from Jah
How many soldiers will fall short?
Shots all around, hope you know that my friend
And in Jah you can depend
