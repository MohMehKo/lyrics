[Intro:]
Oh oh oh oh shoododo
Oh oh oh shoooo
Most people never notice that all dem want
And need is right in front dem eyes
If only they could see
Shoooo...

[Verse 1:]
He's never satisfied no matter how hard she tries to make him feel like a king
She stays home alone, she cooks and she cleans...
She's a good woman but he don't know...

[Chorus:]
I wish I had someone like her
Just to show how much she's worth
And if I had someone like her
I would work to erase the hurt
I'll never take for granted all you give to me
To find a virtuous woman is not easy
Sometimes love is blind
Sometimes we see
And ringing in my head is what my mama tell meeee
Wanty wanty no getty and getty getty no wanty huh
Wanty wanty no getty and getty getty no wanty huh huh
Wanty wanty no getty and getty getty no wantyyyyy
Wanty wanty no getty and getty getty no wanty

[Verse 2:]
He's never satisfied no matter how hard she tries to make him feel complete
She believes his lies, he does no wrong
Her eyes he's her mr. right

[Chorus:]
I wish I had someone like her
Just to show how much she's worth
And if I had someone like her
I would work to erase the hurt
I'll never take for granted all you give to me
To find a virtuous woman is not easy
Sometimes love is blind
Sometimes we see
And ringing in my head is what my mama tell meeee
Wanty wanty no getty and getty getty no wanty huh
Wanty wanty no getty and getty getty no wanty huh huh
Wanty wanty no getty and geety getty no wantyyyyy
Wanty wanty no getty and getty getty no wanty

[Verse 3:]
You've got to show, show, show her how much you love her
Show, show, show her grow together
Show, show, show her how much you need her
Grow, grow stronger together

[Chorus:]
Wanty wanty no getty and getty getty no wanty huh
Wanty wanty no getty and getty getty no wanty huh huh
Wanty wanty no getty and getty getty no wantyyyyy
Wanty wanty no getty and getty getty no wanty
