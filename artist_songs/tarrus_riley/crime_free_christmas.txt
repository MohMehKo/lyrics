Season's greetings

If you waan gi' we a Christmas gift
Tell you 'bout this, mek me tell you 'bout this

All I want for Christmas is to stay alive
Cyaan tek the sound dem of the .45
All I want for Christmas is to stay alive
Well a health and strength, more life

Tired a me bredda and me sista dem a quarrel
Hey, come mek we drink likkle sorrel
Tell Auntie Joan and Uncle Warren
Send clothes and grocery, no gun inna barrel
Done know seh Santa nah no gift a carry

Oh, holiday time and school done
And nothing we need fi have fun

All I want for Christmas is to stay alive
Cyaan tek the sound dem of the .45
All I want for Christmas is a new brand ride
With a thick empress inside, hold tight

No snow no fall, only thing a likkle breeze
No one nah stick you up with gun and bawl freeze
No brutal police, beat you till you weak

Black lives matter inna Jamaica to we

Petty thief, lowe the likkle youth dem with dem phone dem
