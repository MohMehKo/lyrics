[Verse 1:]
Weather man say we'll expecting rain
Me and my baby gonna be up till late
There is no need to wash inside
She showing signs her eyes don't lie

Listen woman I don't drive too fast
Buckle up girl and I'll just relax
Yes you know I know this road
Take you on a journey with eyes close

[Chorus:]
And she said hurry up
Push it to the limit
Don't you worry about it
I say baby hold mi
Cause we gonna ride all night long

[Verse 2:]
She's flirting, but am turning
Push faster, tires burning
Swipping, dripping, shifting
Loving the full inch stiff in
Oh yea, we cursing
No hands still moving
She's telling me something
She said

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Weather man was right here comes the rain
The clock is ticking girls
Get too late
Now it's time for over drive
Stop wasting time she reply

[Chorus x2]
