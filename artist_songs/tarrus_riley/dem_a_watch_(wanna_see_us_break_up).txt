Ah! Oh yeah
Seems I'mma losing you, ah yeah
Listen!

If something's wrong, please tell me
Something feels so strange, baby
You don't answer yuh phone and you don't call me
Something feels so wrong, baby
When you lay beside me you feel so far
Recently I've been thinking
If am not mistaken I heard you call
Another man's name while sleeping
Words going around, say you nah waan me again
Yuh tell yuh friends any day now
Our relationship will end

And dem a watch (say dem a watch)
Sit down and ah wait (say dem ah wait)
Deh wanna see us break up, walk out
Lose everything we built
And dem a chat (say dem a chat)
And dem ah wait (say dem ah wait)
Deh wanna see us break up, walk out
And lose everything we built

Now fifteen years can't go in vain
And this feeling's drivin' me insane
Given you everything, even my last name
Wedding bells and ah diamond ring
You don't say I love you any more
Something feels so wrong, baby
Have you got me feeling insecure
Love don't feel so strong lately
And words going around, say you nah waan me again
Yuh tell yuh friends any day now
Our relationship will end

And dem a watch (say dem a watch)
Sit down and ah wait (say dem ah wait)
Deh wanna see us break up, walk out
Lose everything we built
And dem a chat (say dem a chat)
And dem ah wait (say dem ah wait)
Deh wanna see us break up, walk out
And lose everything we built

Seem to me I'm losing
Seems I'm losing you
Seem to me I'm losing

You're coming home late lately
There is ah strange scent on your dress
The look on your face says guilty
Evidence of unfaithfulness
Where did we go wrong?
When did this happen?
Our love was so strong
And now I feel it fading

And dem a watch (say dem a watch)
Sit down and ah wait (say dem ah wait)
Deh wanna see us break up, walk out
Lose everything we built
And dem a chat (say dem a chat)
And dem ah wait (say dem ah wait)
Deh wanna see us break up, walk out
And lose everything we built

Is dem a watch (say dem a watch)
Sit down and ah wait (say dem ah wait)
Wanna see us break up, walk out
Lose everything we built
And dem a chat (say dem a chat)
And dem ah wait (say dem ah wait)
Deh wanna see us break up, walk out
And lose everything we built
