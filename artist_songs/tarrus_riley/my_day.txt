[Verse 1:]
Today mi rise like the sunrise
Mi bright and mi upright
No one can bruk mi vibes
And mi no care who waan fight
And who waan criticize
Am on a higher height
So you can say what you want to
And do what you want to
It's no concern to me
Because mi have mi own vision
Mi deh pon mi own mission
To rule my destiny

[Chorus:]
Oh it's my day, to do what I want to
It's my time, and I'll use it any way I want to
It's my lifem and I responsible for every action
It's all mine, my day, my time, my life

[Verse 2:]
I beg you easy no, gimmi some reason no
And don't invade my space
Am in a different place, different phase
Moving on my way
So if you feel like a champion
Then nothing can go wrong
This one is your song
Put away your troubles
Put away your worries
Help me sing along

[Chorus x2]
