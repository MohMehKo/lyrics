[Intro:]
Well out of the fruit trees birds and the beas
One thing Jah made special fi we
Rather herbs fi wi nerves
Vegetables to eat
One thing just fi me

[Chorus:]
Woman dem a the greatest creation
Greatest creation

Woman you a the greatest creation
Mi nah disrespect dem no

[Verse 1:]
Mi have a queen from up a Poppien
Thick like a dasheen
When time yo nah si mi
Guess weh mi lock in
Cherry from August Town a tell mi love lock in
Bev from Sea Fort a feed pon coffeen
Who a carry feelings, Cathrine from St. Catherin
Seh shi a go vex any how mi link Catiline
Jump in a mi vehicle yow mi gashing and mi dashing
Over Portmore fi the splishing and splashing
Stop over owner quick
Link up Sonia fast
Gone a road cause mi no in a no chatting
Hope no deh a Hope Road
Cut am not stopping
Shat up the bolivar fast, man haffi stop in

A de part fi let off something well shocking
Book in a the vally wid her head top scratching
Seh mi have a girl over Sherlock knocking
Seh me, a wa this? A dem parade matching
Anytime dem si mi dem a cry over me
Concert sold out cry out fi mi
Every color, every class, and every nationality
A man without a woman well that could not be mi

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Mi Caribbean princess dem love mi bad
Have one a Trinidad, is like shi out fi mad
Shi seh shi want a baby and shi want mi be the dad
So shi sit down pon top a the riddim
And sit down pon top a the version
Misvhin from over Insin
Hey Bajian girls miss mi
Mi and Belize girls have history
Sherine a ma Guyana girls get the victory
Wooy, Bahamas, Aruba, Antigua, Angola
Virgin Island ladies a mi treasure
Big up mi princess dem in a Africa
Europe, to UK, to US a vay
If a np Tarrus Riley a Singy, Singy
From Paris, to Landon, to NYC
If a no Jukeboxx Productions a bachently

[Chorus x2]
