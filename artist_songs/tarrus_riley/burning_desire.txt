Loving you is sweeter than ice-cream on a honeycomb
Loving you is sweeter than ice-cream on a honeycomb

I'm waking up to your love
You fill me up, you give me vibes.
And I build you up, I sip a cup
Eyes open up, and Ive got the strength,
So I can face the world, baby!
See your touch, I need it much
Something extra special to pick me up.
If loving you was wrong, better them lock me up,
Cause I can't do without my baby.

Uh, uh, burning in the morning, burning in the evening
Uh, uh, burn ya, burn ya, burn ya, baby!
Uh, uh, burning in the morning, burning in the evening
Uh, uh, burn ya, burn ya, burn ya, baby!

The way you smell, it turns me on
Is that my favorite perfume you're wearing on?
You know just what to do to keep my calm
I can't live without you, baby!
Feeling for you, I need a hint
Like gravity, I'm pulling you toward my lips
Laugh like a star every time we kiss
I can't do without you, baby!

Uh, uh, burning in the morning, burning in the evening
Uh, uh, burn ya, burn ya, burn ya, baby!
Uh, uh, burning in the morning, burning in the evening
Uh, uh, burn ya, burn ya, burn ya, baby!

My loves one fire, burning desire
Girl, you take me higher and higher!
My loves one fire, burning desire
You're all I need, you're all I require, huh!

Uh, uh, burning in the morning, burning in the evening
Uh, uh, burn ya, burn ya, burn ya, baby!
Uh, uh, burning in the morning, burning in the evening
Uh, uh, burn ya, burn ya, burn ya, baby!

Waking up to your love
You fill me up, you give me vibes
And I will build you up!
I sip a cup, eyes open up
I've got the strength, so I can face the world, baby!
I see your touch, I needed much
Something extra-special to pick me up.
If loving you is wrong, better them lock me up,
Cause I can't do without you, baby!

Uh, uh, burning in the morning, burning in the evening
Uh, uh, burn ya, burn ya, burn ya, baby!
Uh, uh, burning in the morning, burning in the evening
Uh, uh, burn ya, burn ya, burn ya, baby!

The way you smell, it turns me on
Is that my favorite perfume you're wearing on?
You know just what to do to keep my calm
I can't live without you, baby!
Feeling for you, I need a hint
Like gravity, I'm pulling you toward my lips
Laugh like a star every time we kiss
I can't do without you, baby!

Uh, uh, burning in the morning, burning in the evening
Uh, uh, burn ya, burn ya, burn ya, baby!
Uh, uh, burning in the morning, burning in the evening
Uh, uh, burn ya, burn ya, burn ya, baby!
Oh baby, oh!
