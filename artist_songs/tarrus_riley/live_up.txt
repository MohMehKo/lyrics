[Chorus:]
Come meck wi live up, and prove dem wrong
A no every youth a go turn gun man
Don't give up, ghetto youth be strong
The whole a wi a star, wi a born champion

Live up, and prove dem wrong
Easy ghetto girl get yo education
Don't give up, ghetto youth be strong
Wi got to make the change a little foundation

[Verse 1:]
At a young tender age
Babylon lock wi in a cage
Waan turn you in a mental slave
Who no mad dem go down in a grave
But dem cyaa get wi out in a this yah time
Wi no hype but wi proud nah commit no crime
And I know we gonna live it upright

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Tek wi fi fool and dem ridicule
And wi a the stone that the builder refuse
Some talk allot but never walk in a wi shoes
And dem think it easy fi live how we do

Cyaa get wi out in a this yah time
Wi no hype but wi proud nah commit no crime
And I know we gonna live it upright

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
We believe that we will achieve
And that's possibility
Dark clouds, raging seas
Still the sun will shine for me

Cyaa get wi out in a this yah time
Wi no hype but wi proud nah commit no crime
And I know we gonna live it upright

[Chorus]
