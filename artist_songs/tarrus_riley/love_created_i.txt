Blessed love, Satta Massagana
Igziabeher, Negust, Negast
Kadamawe, Kadamawe, Kadamawe

Give us the teaching of Marcus Garvey
Kebra Negast means Glory of Kings
Give I and I Selassie I and keep the guy
With the blue eyes for yourself

'Cause people without a vision perish like suicide
You tell me its not about color
Still you refuse to take the picture off the wall
All you do is trick the brothers, keep them confused
They don't know who to call in this critical war

And you tell me of a paradise in the sky but that's a lie
And you tell me, I was born in sin and shaped
In inequity when love created I
Look how many prophets tried
To open our eyes, you can't fool me

Look how they're treating us
This new millennium slavery
I see them hiding the chains
And still beating us daily

And now we mentally poisoned to fight we black skin
And bleaching ah the in thing far out and far in sin
You tell me its not about color
Still you refuse to take the images out your books

I know that's not how we look, kush
Don't take offense when we shout black power
It carries us through, we been abused
Put yourself in my shoes

And no tell me of a paradise in the sky
But that's a lie
Don't tell me, I was born in sin and shaped
In inequity when love created I

Look how many prophets tried
To open our eyes, you can't fool me
Kadamawe, Kadamawe, Kadamawe

Look how they're treating us
This new millennium slavery
I see them hiding the chains
And still beating us daily

And now we mentally poisoned
To fight we Black skin
And a bleaching ah the new thing
Far out and far in, sin

You tell me its not about color
Still you refuse to take the picture off the wall
All you do is trick the brothers, keep them confused
They don't know who to call in this, yeah spiritual war

So no tell me of a paradise in the sky
'Cause that's a lie and you tell me
I was born in sin and shaped in inequity
When love created I and I

Look how many prophets tried
To open our eyes, you can't fool me
Kadamawe, Kadamawe, Kadamawe

So don't tell me of a paradise in the sky
'Cause that's a lie, no, come tell me
I was born in sin and shaped in inequity
When love created I and I and I

Look how many prophets tried to open our eyes
You can't fool me
Kadamawe, Kadamawe, Kadamawe

You can't fool me, no
You can't fool me, no
