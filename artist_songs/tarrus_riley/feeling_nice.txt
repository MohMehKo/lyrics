[Intro:]
Mi no waan nothing at all stress mi
Cyaa meck no bills and no hills vex mi
And mi no waan no high blood pressure kill mi
So wi going out, need a break
Out, get away
Out, naw lock up inna house

[Chorus:]
Today am feeling free fi enjoy mi self
Mi a mi own boss mi employed mi self
Am free, cyaa put mi inna no box
Cyaa catch mi inna no trap

Feeling free, wi no care weh dem a quitisize
Or wa dem a analyze
Because mi blind to dem, mi deaf to dem
Mi no beg no friend a tell yo then
Am feeling free

[Verse 1:]
I don't wanna hurt nobody
I don't wanna spoil this party
Step in wid a decent shorty
Have got my money
Chimney dem cyaa stop wi
Tell dem look but don't steer at wi
Singy, singy, rep BSMG
Let me tell you something bout Riley

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Free just like a summer breeze
Don't disturb mi thank you please
Working hard and need to breed
Need some time for me

Am going out, need a break
Out, get away
Out, naw lock up inna house

[Chorus]
