All inna broad daylight dem a tek life 
So imagine afta dark when di action start

Dem yah yute yah well blood tirsty 
Nuh mek sun down ketch yuh inna town 
Tek weh yuh self now 

Ova war-rieka hill  
War neva stand still 
And inna garden 
Mi neva see nuh cultivation nor nuh farming-a gwaan 
Dem will done yuh inna kirk (dunkirk) 
All ova watahouse a drought still dem will wet yuh 
Is like yuh life nuh have nuh worth

And nuh see nuh mo' vegetarian alone 

And get dis straight sah

When yuh come out afta x-30 
Nuh trust nuh blue suit nor khaaki  
Nuff a pose like police and dem a tief 
Worst dan di klan weh wrap up inna white sheet 
Freaks come out anytime it touch dark 
Watch how yuh walk inside di park 
He turn she and she turn he some sight to see  
Swap identity and waah come mingle wid we 
New kingston 
Mi si dem a dust but mi nuh see nothing done 
For my people  
Still no one knows the reason 

And mi guh ask a hope road 
Still it was hopeless cause no one would hear ma cry 
Di struggle still continue 
And inna payneland burn di pain and mek wi hold a joy 

Get dis straight sah 
Work for a safer jamaica 
Sweetest land sweetest watah 
Dash weh di pirate cultcha 

Yuh got to be care-ful 
And protect yuh neck 
Protect yuh head back 
Careful and protect yuh neck protect yuh head 

Yuh betta protect yuh neck

All ova waterhouse a drought still dem will wet yuh 
Is like yuh life nuh have nuh worth 
And inna callaloo bed mi nuh si nuh mo vegetarian alone
