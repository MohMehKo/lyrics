[Verse 1:]
Everyone a pop style paw mi
Everyone a step pass mi wid dem lady
But I can't even move without my baby

Every one a pop style paw mi
The one Romeiche him no easy
But I can't step without without my girl

Shi being home alone, sitting near by the phone
Where's my baby, why don't you call me?
There is a fire burning up inside of me
And when she's not around me, I grieve

[Chorus:]
When your gone is like a cloudy day
Need your loving in a every way
A miss you soooo
Baby I miss you soooo

[Verse 2:]
Mi incomplete without mi woman
Mi cross mi no run, yes mi stubborn
Without mi queen things cyaa go wrong
Whoy wah shi a do man
Shi better know seh shi a the yin an mi a the yang
Shi better know seh mi a the bing an shi a the bang
Call mi mi deh deh in a second
Shi a the right one wi cyaa left are

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Mi cyaa eat an mi cyaa even sleep
Mean like shi waan cement mi feet
Stepping not the same without my baby
Mi friends talk how much mi wimp
Dem never experience a love like this
Stepping not the same without my baby
And anytime wi walk out
People haffi look dem haffi talk bout
A exitement, a video lighting
When mi an mi baby going all out
Seh anytime wi walk out
People haffi look dem haffi talk bout
A caw mi flashing everybody tweeting
Who girl you love am missing

[Chorus]
