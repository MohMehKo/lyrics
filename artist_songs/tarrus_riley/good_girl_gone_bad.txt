[Intro:]
Black side Russian
Head concussion (yo Tarrus)
Well, who cyan hear dem a go feel mi seh
When you finga mash no badda cry mi seh
Alright den...

[Verse 1: Tarrus Riley]
Dem big inna body
And will tell yuh dem ready
Mi nuh need no glass fi see dem force ripe
And thru bad company some likkle pickney
Nah tek no talk a straight road, a street life

[Hook:]
Mama likkle princess gone bad
Daddy's likkle angel bruk out
Mama likkle pearl, tell mi seh she ready fi di world
Walkin' out...

[Chorus:]
Just anodda good girl gone bad
Once she was a good girl but now she gone bad
Story of a good girl gone bad
And she don't know what she have
Driving the family mad

Good girl gone bad
Once she was a good girl but now she gone bad
Story of a good girl gone bad
And she don't know what she have
Driving the family mad

[Verse 2:]
[Konshens:]
She go suh hard

The shortest clothes dem she always dress in
[Tarrus:]
She loves to drink, she's into smoking
And ecstasy, she's already floating
[Konshens:]
Mi seh a whole heap a man dem gyal yah back it up pon
From inna di church, di school bus, di taxi or minivan
And if you follow dem gyal yah,
Dem mek you bawl fi yuh madda from behind the prison bars
Worse if yuh a star nuh gih dem no par

[Hook:]
Mama likkle angel gone bad
Daddy's likkle princess bruk out
Mama likkle pearl, a tell mi seh she ready fi di world

[Chorus:]
Just anodda good girl gone bad
Once she was a good girl but now she gone bad
Story of a good girl gone bad
And she don't know what she have
Driving the family mad

Good girl gone bad
Once she was a good girl but now she gone bad
Story of a good good girl gone bad
And she don't know what she have
Driving the family mad

[Bridge:]
Who cyan hear dem a go feel mi seh
When you finga mash no badda cry mi seh
Who cyan hear dem a go feel mi seh
And when you finga mash no badda cry mi seh
Aright den...

[Verse 1: Tarrus Riley]
Well, dem big inna body
And will tell yuh dem ready
Mi nuh need no glass fi see dem force ripe.
Tarrus, and thru bad company some likkle pickney
Nah tek no talk a straight road, a street light

And mi seh daddy's likkle angel bruk out now
Mama likkle pearl, tell mi seh she ready fi di world
Walkin out...

[Chorus:]
Just anodda good girl gone bad
Once she was a good girl but now she gone bad
Story of a good good girl gone bad
And she don't know what she have
Driving the family mad
Good girl gone bad
She was a good girl gone bad
Dis likkle good good good good girl gone bad
And now she don't know what she have
Driving the family mad

[Outro:]
Who can hear dem a go feel mi seh
When you finga mash no badda cry mi seh, hey
Who can hear dem a go feel mi seh
And when you finga mash no badda cry mi seh
Russian...
