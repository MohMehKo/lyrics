[Ad libs:]
Ay ay ay ay
Ay ay ay ay

[Intro:]
Oh let us lift our eyes to the hills
From whence cometh our help yes I
And give us health and strength rastafari
In these challenging times I say
Never let I foot be moved
Show I to improve
Let the words of my mouth
And meditation be true

[Chorus:]
Cause Africa awaits its creator
Those at home and abroad
Cause Africa awaits its creator
Those at home and abroad
So let peace be within thy walls
And prosperity in the palace
To every rebel with a past
Jah is watching over his prophet

So when your going out and coming in
Let jah protect you forever more
Oh yea oh yea
And just like the days of mighty king david
We trample with the Philippines
Defending our fates seems hard

Never let I foot be moved
On the battlefield can't lose
Let the evil know
The most high is carrying you through

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Them think that I and I no sleep
And him no slumber
So the sunshine that smite I
No one fight I either
For jah is thy keeper
Strength and redeemer
Forever

Africa awaits its creator
Those at home and abroad [x4]

So let peace be behind those bars
And prosperity in the palace
To every rebel with a past
Jah is watching over his prophet
Ay ay ay ay
Jah is watching over his prophet
Oh oh oh
Jah is watcing over his prophet
