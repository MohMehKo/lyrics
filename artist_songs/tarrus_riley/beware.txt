[INTRO:]
Beware for the Shottas dem strap
rastaman ah tell di youths dem fill low di Glock
Beware now dat cause heart attach and dem nuh care (no ooo)

Its a shame to see brothers killing themselves
Wasting energy, should be uplifting themselves
Who's di enemy putting shots on the shelf
What we need is brain-food and belly-food for our health

So don't get caught up in a petty passion
Be careful of dem guns and ammunition
And let us make a change in meditation
Cause we could use the strength for cultivation (my lord!)

[CHORUS:]
Beware for the Shotta dem strap
Rastaman ah tell di youths dem nuh rat-ta-ta-tat
Beware now dat cause heart attach and dem nuh care and dem wi shot yuh inna yuh poop-poop-poop
Beware now the whole place hot Rastaman ah tell di youths dem fill low di Glock
beware now dat cause heart attach and dem nuh care (no noooo)

So much gun crime man ah shot man ah night time
Read yuh head lines lord it really blows my mind
School children targeted in the broad daylight
Dem ah dead fi cell phones, also inna drive by
Police ah dead to, one ah day
Dem shot di sheriff and ah come fi di deputy (Gezzz!)
All woman dem nuh partial 
Wah mek deh kill di old lady and di old man

Beware for the Shotta dem strap
Rastaman ah tell di youths dem fi 'low di Glock
Beware now dat cause heart attach and dem nuh care and dem wi shot out you poop-poop
Beware now the whole place hot Rastaman ah tell di youths dem nuh ra-ta-tat
beware now dat cause heart attach and dem nuh care and dem wi shot you ina yuh poop-poop-poop

Blood flooding the streets
Rude bwoys and police ah compete
Because dem turn to RAS-Tafari
Then all and all wouldda alright
Now here we go again
another man drop flat again
Go ahead and tell yuh friend, di streets nuh safe again
While dem searching for terrorist
Youths dem die for foolishness

[CHORUS]

Its ashame to see brothers killing themselves
Wasting energy, should be uplifting themselves
Why is di enemy putting shots on the shelf
What we need is brain-food and belly-food for our health

So don't get caught up in a petty passion
Be careful of dem guns and ammunition
And let us make a change in meditation
Cause we could use the strength for cultivation
