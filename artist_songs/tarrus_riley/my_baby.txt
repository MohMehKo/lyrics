My little baby don't follow the rules
She likes to do things her own way
She's gonna need a baby brother soon
To share the attention with a pow'r mate

This little baby can be so rude
And she refuse to eat baby food
This little baby is giving mommy stress
And it's hard to sleep while she fights of her breast

Ah cyan sleep, Ah cyan sleep
Ah cyan sleep, But I love my baby
Cyan sleep, Cyan sleep
Ah cyan sleep, But I love my baby

This little baby don't sleep in a crib
But I and I remember one night she wish that she did
'cause she was tossing and turning in bed
She made one wrong roll, fall and hit her head
Crying huuhhh, huuhhh, huuhhh
This little baby


Ah cyan sleep, ah cyan sleep
Who needs sleep when you have a little baby
To love....yeah... To love.

Love my baby
