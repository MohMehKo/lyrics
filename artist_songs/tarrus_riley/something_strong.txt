Hey!!! We got it going on 
Hey-ey-ey!!! We got it going on.. 

No separating, me and my ladi. 
We firm as the rock of Gibraltar, and mountains around Hi-rusalem. 
You labor in vain if yuh try tobring us pain cuz youll neva will 
You can not go round us, she said Tarrus, nothing divides us 

Now theres more than a million reasons to quit, but well never split 
More than a million reasons to quit, but were holding on 
Love is what dreams are made ofand in my visions all I see is her 
We got something strong and so were holding on 

Dem never know me serious, never want go link pon anotha 
Till around at that time to carry home to motha 
Dem put up all type of tracks and barriers 
Fi ah show dem dat true loves a conqueror 

More than a million reasons to quit, but well ever split. 
We got something strong and so were holding on 

This love is the truth, yeah, and we've got the fruits to prove it. 
Still I keep a wide eye for parasites who try to defy 
Now, people gone try things, some find pleasure in spoiling a good thing 
Still I let dem know that innaour life there is no weaklings. 

Now there's more than a million rivers to cross, but we gone make it through 
And more than a gazillion people gonna talk, so so so so so so 
Love that dreams are made of, and in my visions all I see is her 
We got something strong and so were holding on
