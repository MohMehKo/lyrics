No love at all, no love yuh see... Sad, it's a shame yuh know. Yeah... Uh
Uh, this is a love song
Unconditional, uh
We need love, we need love

Plant a seed of love, you'll reap it
Walk and speak of love, you'll see it

A burden to society, that is what they think of me
They see trouble in my eyes
Ask me why I'm angry, it's all the hypocrisy
That every man sees and still they're blind, so blind

There's no love, no love, I'm telling you brother
No-one is willing to compromise
And it's a shame 'cause,
We need love, we need love, more love, yeah
It should be active in our lives

It doesn't hurt to share, it doesn't hurt to care
It doesn't hurt to give, so let love live in our lives
It doesn't hurt to share, it doesn't hurt to care
But it hurts to know that some won't let love grow

No no, there's no love, no love, I'm telling you daughters
No-one is willing to compromise
And it's a shame pain
Cause we need love, we need love, more love, yeah
It should be active in our lives

It doesn't hurt to share, it doesn't hurt to care
It doesn't hurt to give, so let love live in our lives
It doesn't hurt to share, it doesn't hurt to care
But it hurts to know that some won't let love grow

Nobody cares for love anymore...

A burden to society, that is what they think of me
They see anger in my eyes
Ask me why I'm so angry, it's all this hypocrisy
Everyone sees and yet they're blind, so blind

There's no love, no love, no love, no
No-one is willing to compromise
We need love, more love, more love
Cause love should be active in our lives
It's a shame...

It doesn't hurt to share, it doesn't hurt to care
It doesn't hurt to give, so let love live in our lives
It doesn't hurt to share, it doesn't hurt to care
But it hurts to know that some won't let love grow
