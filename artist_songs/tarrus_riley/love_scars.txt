[Intro:]
Woman don't cry
Cause it hurts inside to see your tears fall
I apologize for every man who as done you wrong

[Chorus:]
You say your heart has being broken
Your smile as being stolen
Tired of being a victim of love

[Verse 1:]
Every time you let someone in
It's like a dagger piercing straight through your heart
He left you with wounds, love stars
I can fix it if you give me the chance
Relation with wounds leave scars
I can fix it if you give me the chance
Still brose from the first cut
Oh shi say the sky's are deep
You smile but now she's up
Every night alone she sleeps
All she want's is to be love
Love is no where to be found
Search your life for mister right
Mister right is always wrong

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
You've being torn an abuse
No hurt before
And you can't offord to trust love anymore

He left you with wounds, love stars
I can fix it if you give me the chance
Relation with wounds leave scars
I can fix it if you give me the chance
Still brose from the first cut
Oh shi say the sky's are deep
You smile but now she's up
Every night alone she sleeps
All she want's is to be love
Love is no where to be found
Search your life for mister right
Mister right is always wrong

[Intro]

[x2:]
He left you with wounds, love stars
I can fix it if you give me the chance
Relation with wounds leave scars
I can fix it if you give me the chance
Still brose from the first cut
Oh shi say the sky's are deep
You smile but now she's up
Every night alone she sleeps
All she want's is to be love
Love is no where to be found
Search your life for mister right
Mister right is always wrong
