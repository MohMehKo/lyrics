Mister Babylon, yeah!
Has got the people's eyes blind folded.
Lost inna nursery rhymes and fiction.
Still there's a real world
And it's full of many so things that are not right
It's no fairy tale, it's a harsh reality

it looks like the three blind mice
them are the big guys who put the price on the rice
the dish ram away with the spoon
many were left hungry desperate for food
you've got to check those parables
you've got to sus' it
caz babylon to tricky and them moving well slippery
check those parable you've got to sus it

now jack and jill went up the hill
to rob poor people against their will
them think them wise and think them skilled
nah get no water!
humpty dumpty had to fall
him scorn the crown and climbed the wall
and all of them he had to call to get a plaster yow!

parables you've got to sus it
cuz babylon to tricky and them moving well slippery
check those parables you've got to sus it
