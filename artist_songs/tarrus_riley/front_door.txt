[Verse 1:]
Give me back the keys to her front door
Because it seem like she didn't care about me anymore
Give her all the love I had and she spill it
So I pack my things in to a shopping bag and decide to split

[Chorus:]
But lord knows that I
Don't wanna be lonely tonight
No I don't wanna be lonely tonight
I mean it, yes I mean it
I don't wanna be lonely tonight
But I would rather to be lonely than to live a dirty life

[Verse 2:]
All of the things that we being through girl
Use to make me happy, now make me blue
And I didn't believe the things that I've herd no
Now I seen it with my own eyes
Action speak louder than words

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

[Chorus x2]
