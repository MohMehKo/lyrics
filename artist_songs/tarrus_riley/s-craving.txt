They meet on the streets, after hours
Secret lovers living under cover
She's tired and frustrated and just can't bother
And instead of going home, she's going out with another man
And a seh she love cheating, me ask her why she sweet then

She said the smartest people do some foolish things
And it's all about a feeling, oh

Out on the road, John Doe
Don't want his woman to know and so he keeps it on the low
He's tired and frustrated and just nah go
Home tonight, I'm gonna prowl tonight well
And second of cheating, me ask him why him dweet then

Him said the strongest people turn inna weaklings
Any time them get the craving

It's hard in the game and s-craving
Dem can't tame, man ah woman can't tame
Hard in the game and s-craving
Dem can't tame, man ah woman can't tame
An ancient game from them old time days
Ask David, Solomon and Shiva
It's all in the game, be careful how you play 'cause
Dem can't tame, man ah woman can't tame, no

Can't control dem
You can't tame dem
Ooh, yeah

Some keep it real and some keep the love true
Some take it straight to where thing build night dues
Some do it for money, some do it for the rush
Some have love at first sight and fall in a crush, but

And them said them love cheating, me ask them why dem dweet then
Them said the smartest people do some foolish things
And it's all about a feeling, ooh

Out on the road, a so it go
Don't want nobody to know that's why we keep it on the low
Disguise our fears, don't want it to show
It won't hurt a soul, if they don't know
Some a do it through sneaking, me tell them why we dweet then

The smartest people do some foolish things
Any time they get the craving

It's hard in the game and s-craving
Dem can't tame, man ah woman can't tame
Hard in the game and s-craving
Can't tame, man ah woman can't tame
It's an ancient game from them old time days
Ask David, Solomon and Shiva
It's all in the game, be careful how you play 'cause
Dem can't tame, man ah woman can't tame

You can't tame dem
Not even me can't tame dem..
