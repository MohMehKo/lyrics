Give us the teaching of Marcus Garvey
Kebra Negast means Glory of Kings
Give I and I Selassie I and keep the images of lies for yourself
People without a vision perish like suicide

You tell me its not about color
Still you refuse to take the picture off the wall
All you do is trick the brothers and keep them confused
They don't know who to call in this spiritual war

Nah tell me, have a paradise in the sky, well that's a lie
And nah tell me, I was born in sin and shaped
In inequity when love created I
Look how many prophets tried
To open our eyes, you can't fool me

Look how they're treating us
New millennium slavery
Hiding the chains and still 
beating us daily

Now we mentally poisoned to fight we black skin
And bleaching ah the in thing far out and far in sin

You tell me its not about color
Still you refuse to take the picture out your books
I know that's not how we look, kush

All you do is trick the brothers and keep them confused
They don't know who to call in this heretical war

Don't tell me, have a paradise in the sky
But that's a lie
Don't tell me, I was born in sin and shaped
In inequity when love created I

Look how many prophets tried
To open our eyes, you can't fool me
Kadamawe, Kadamawe, Kadamawe

Give us the teaching of Marcus Garvey
Kebra Negast means Glory of Kings
Give I and I Selassie, keep your images of lies
for yourself
People without a vision perish like suicide

You tell me its not about color
Still you refuse to take the picture off the wall
All you do is trick the brothers and keep them confused
They don't know who to call in this heretical war

Nah tell me have a paradise in the sky, well that's a lie
Don't you tell me, I was born in sin and shaped
In inequity when love created I
Look how many prophets tried
To open our eyes, you can't fool me
Kadamawe, Kadamawe, Kadamawe

So nah tell me of a paradise in the sky
Well that's a lie, and nah tell me
I was born in sin and shaped in inequity
When Jah created I.

Look how many prophets tried
Look how many prophets tried...
