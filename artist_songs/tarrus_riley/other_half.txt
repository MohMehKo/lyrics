If I have to share you
Baby you know that I don't mind
As long as I be your.. Other half

To have a little bit of something
beats having nothing at all
As long as I be your.. Other half.

Ain't got no shame
ain't got no pride
a little she gives to me
makes me wanna settle 
for whatever, for whatever

So If I have to share you, 
Baby you know I don't mind
As long as I be your.. Other half

To have a little bit of something
Beats having nothing at all
As long as I be your.. Other half.

Ain't got no shame
ain't got no pride
a little she gives to me
makes me wanna settle 
for whatever, for whatever

Ain't got no shame
ain't got no pride
a little you give to me
makes me wanna settle 
or whatever...

Ain't got no shame
ain't got no pride
a little you give to me
makes me wanna settle 
or whatever... 
For what ever... [x5]
