Looking out, across the night time
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

Get me out, into the night time
Four walls won't hold me tonight
And if this town, is just an apple
Will you take a bite

And if they say, why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, he does it to me that way, oh, oh
Tell me why, why, tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, he does it to me that way

Reaching out, to a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
And see that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

And if they say, why, why
Just tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, he does it to me that way
If they say, why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, he haffi do me that way
I love living this way
I love living this way, oh, oh, ooh

Looking out, across the morning
The city heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

And if they say, why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, he does it to me that way, oh
Why, why, tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, he does it to me this way
Why, why, tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
They say why, why, tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, he haffi do me that way, no
Why, why, tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, do me that way
I love living that way
