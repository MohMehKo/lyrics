[Intro:]
So many stories of relationship gone wrong
Nuff man a look up inna sun
An some a drown dem sorrows inna rum
But if love means sacrificing all for you
Now am for you, an your for you
What must I do

[Chorus:]
Naw meck yo run mi head girl
Naw meck yo run ma head space
Mi seh mi naw meck yo mad mi
Naw meck yo drive mi crazy

Naw meck yo rum am head girl
Naw meck yo mash up ma brain
Mi seh mi naw meck yo mad mi
Naw meck yo drive mi crazy

[Verse 1:]
I don't wanna be like those broken hear-ted an feeling sad
An mi no inna fairy tale love
Like Romio an Juliet
I want a real love I can feel
Someone who's always there for me
When I need her, an I'll dry her tears
So many stories of relationship gone wrong
New found love is strong
But will it lost for long
And if love means sacrificing all for you
Poring out my heart to you
An playing love fool

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Mi wi give you everything or anything
But mi want the same from you
An mi no have no one bag a rules girl
All I want from you is to be true
I need a real love I can feel
Someone who always there for me
When I need her, an I dry her tears

[Intro]

[Chorus x2]
