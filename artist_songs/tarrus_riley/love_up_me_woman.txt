[Intro:]
Think I don't want to
I know I really need to
I don't wanna lose you
You mean the world to me

Why don't you spend some time with me
No excuse I need you
Baby I've being so caught up in work I couldn't see
Know one thing for sure I don't wanna lose you

[Chorus:]
So mi a go love up mi woman
Love up mi woman
Spend some quality time wid mi woman

Love up mi woman
Hug up mi woman
Meck shi feel special tonight

Love up mi woman
Love up mi woman
Spend some quality time wid mi woman
Care wid mi woman
Share wid mi woman
Meck shi feel special tonight

[Verse 1:]
Now life haffi balance
Yes it is a challenge
Must separate work from play
24/7 inna road like stop light
It cyaa work, no sah, no way
Haffi find ways and you haffi make space
Fi meck shi feel great
Night or day
And any man weh no treat him girl right
A make a great mistake

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
So why don't you spend some time with me
No excuse I need you
Baby I've being so caught up in work I couldn't see
Know one thing for sure I don't wanna lose you
Mi naw left no space fi a next man run in
Come intervene and take weh mi queen
Mi naw go a party and left are lock in
When me step, she step
Together wi a team
Hey no disrespect to my friend dem
Lose and yo lose, yo might lose yo empress
Don't vex, just give are loving inna excess

[Chorus]
