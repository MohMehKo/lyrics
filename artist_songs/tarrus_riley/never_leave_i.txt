[Intro:]
I careless bout workers of iniquity
Rastafari is my security
Chimney

[Chorus:]
And am o going out and coming in
Never leave I jah jah
And keep mi far from vampires
And am o going out and coming in
Keep mi by your right hand
And keep mi far from Satan

[Verse 1:]
Oily walk with mi
Talk to mi
Show mi the thoughts in dem heart fi mi
Mi deh pon mi journey dem cyan si mi
Dem a pray fi si mi car right off wid mi
Be a shield fi mi
Revealed to mi
The bad card wa dem a deal an gimmi
You never hesitate fi buss di seal fi mi
Oily oily

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
More time mi cyan believe
Feel fi greeve
Flesh dem a tear and dem coming at me
The bible tell mi bout a lashing of teeth
Mi think a joke but now the jokes on me
Stay with me
Oily high clear di stage fi mi
Dem smile in a mi face unu a dig a grave fi mi
So when mi touch di road jah jah a rave with mi

[Chorus]

[Intro]

[Verse 3:]
And mi a strive with those wa strive with me
Fight against dem wa a fight against we
Chimney ohhh sing it

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]
