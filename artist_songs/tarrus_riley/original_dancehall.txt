[Verse 1:]
Hey put down the guns a second an lock dem weh
Hey use yo knife fi peal fruits or dash dem away
Some a preach war from Sunday to Saturday
Hold a steady meddy change yo levity
Hey mi tired, mi frustrated
Every day mi wake another one dead
Jah know mi tired, mi naw take it
Too much war time wasted

[Chorus 1:]
So ease up tonight mi no waan fi si no trigger fingers
Ease up man grab a woman everything wi seal up
Hey dance if yo wanto
Truck bad thoughts me an black oil used a team up
Seh look how da tune yah bad
So long fi wheel up
Dancehall hot is like wi steam up
Hey tun up the sound a rubadove party

[Verse 2:]
Yo know a long time mi don't feel so nice
An it's about time wi gwaan hold a vibes
Drum an base a roll, hold yo lover tight
Caw when wi a party a straight till day light
But that a one time that naw gwaan again
An just fi lock off the dance nobody else have the tren

And a no so mi really intend fi live

[Chorus 2:]

Tonight mi no waan fi si no trigger finger

Hey put the war vibes aside
At least fi one night meck wi si the enemy dem team up
Dance off yo shoes wet up yo tea shirt

Hey selector tun up the sound a rubadove party

Hey send a request an put yo glass to the sealing
Let go the stress an take the musical healing
Watch all the nice an decent people dem a love up
While dem a rub up the speaker bun up
Wooy you no si the vibes tun up
Mi naw leave until the sun come up

[Chorus 1]
