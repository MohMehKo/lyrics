[Pre-Chorus:]
Ever since we met baby
No need for running around
Looks like you cool me down
You cool me down
Girl, and time is wasting whenever your not around
Look like you cool me down girl
You cool me down

[Verse 1:]
I don't need another lover
I don't even have to bother
I found it in you
Now I feel brand new
You understand the little things that make loving work
You give me all I need
And more, and I love you girl

[Chorus:]
Since we being hanging
No more flirting around
Who girl you cool me down
You cool me down

And she gives me something that keeps me staying around
This girl cools me down
You cool me down

[Verse 2:]
Baby, and what you giving to me
Mi haffi tell mi friend from Chimney
Shi have the size and the figure well suited for me
And yes she brights, and she writes love letter for me

Me and mi woman meck a perfect team
Like the perfect watch to the perfect jeans
Anf if you bitch me it won't even have meaning
Oh this is real am not dreaming

[Chorus x2]
