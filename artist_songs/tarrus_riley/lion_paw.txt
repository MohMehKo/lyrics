Can't touch di lion
He's so humble.
Neva touch di lion.
Roarin'...

I'm walking through this valley of test, 
and I've never been a weak heart in the wilderness.

The Power of Jah preserves I, 
guiding in all I do.
So trodding through the heights and depths, 
we trample frustration and we conquer stress.

The power of Jah preserves I and guides in all I do.

So all the evils that mean me harm. 
Can go back where they came from. 
No demonic words perform, shall prosper yea.

I tell di obia an di science man calm, 
cause him cyan squeeze di lion palm. 
No demonic words performed shall prosper.

Can't touch di lion.
I an I yea.

Di wages of blessin is everliving life, 
so keep our meditation inna highly high. 
We'll weather storm and put up a fight, 
cause we can do anything.

Should feel like giving up, 
let the strength of your ancesters fill your cup.

The power of Jah preserves I and guides in all I do

So all the evils that mean me harm. 
Can go back where they came from. 
No demonic words perform, shall prosper yea.

I tell di obia an di science man calm, 
cause him cyan squeeze di lion palm.

Cyan touch di lion, He's so strong.
Roarin' lion..

An di more dem oil up, an di more dem business spoil up.

Yes the di more, dem come wid science,

Di more dem oil up, an di more dem business spoil up.
