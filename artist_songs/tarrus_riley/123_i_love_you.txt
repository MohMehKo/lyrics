1-2-3 I'm loving you
4-5-6 I'm missing you
7-8-9 I want you back

1-2-3 I love you
4-5-6 I Miss you
7-8-9 I want you back
Here within my arms again

Long time, no see
Without your love I'm lonely
I miss you
And its too hard to bear

What have you done to me?
I'm waking up in the middle of the night
Without you
And its so unfair

I toss, turn, reach for you
Only my pillows
Awake, the morning
Sun rises, but I'm alone
Hurts me so

1-2-3 I'm loving you
4-5-6 I'm missing you
7-8-9 I want you back

1-2-3 I love you
4-5-6 I miss you
7-8-9 I want you back
Here within my arms again.

It shows, on my face
Evidence is right here
My smile has been erased
Can't you tell?

I have no appetite
My food has no taste
I'm losing weight
Thought you could be replaced

I day dream of you and me
And how great we used to be
And I firmly believe
Of turning these dreams into reality
Like a child would say so easy to you

1-2-3 I'm loving you
4-5-6 I'm missing you
7-8-9 I want you back

1-2-3 I love you
4-5-6 I miss you
7-8-9 I want you back
Here within my arms again

Long time, no see
Without your love I'm lonely
I miss you
And its too hard to bear

What have you done to me?
I'm waking up in the middle of the night
Without you
And its so unfair

1-2-3 I'm loving you
4-5-6 I'm missing you
7-8-9 I want you back

1-2-3 I'm loving you
4-5-6 I'm missing you
7-8-9 I want you back
Here within my arms again
