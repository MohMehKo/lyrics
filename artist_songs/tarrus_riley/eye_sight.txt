Man without his faith is like a tree without the roots
Got to be true, got to be true
Strength and protection, given unto I
By Hailey Hailey Hailey, ayy
If you don't have a vision then you're empty inside
Its like you gazing in space, wasting time 
I don't fight religion, all it does is divide
But still I and I and I
Give eyes yes

And do remember sun shall not smite I by day,
Nor the moon by night, in ma going out and going in, 
From this time forth
