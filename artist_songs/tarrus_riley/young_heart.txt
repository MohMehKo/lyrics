Young love
Young love
Young love, ooh, ooh

I knew you would grow to be such a special lady
Even as a little child ooh, you had your own style
You couldn't hide it, you were always shining

And all of my days in high school, I played the fool
Still as a young heart, I knew right there and then
You should be all mine, I would have never got the chance to tell
Oh, as a young heart, I plead my innocence
You should-a been all mine, all mine

Now that we've grown up, I wonder if your love's untouched
Or how it would've been between us
Want to give you so much! So much, so much, hmm

Reminiscing about you early
After school I'd walk you home for a kiss as we'd reach the door
Then I'd rush to reach my home, just to call you on the phone
Couldn't hide it, I'd get so excited

And all of my days in high school, I played the fool
Still as a young heart, I knew right there and then
You should be all mine, but I never got the chance to tell
Still as a young heart, I plead my innocence
You should-a been all mine, all mine

Now that we've grown up, I wonder if your love's untouched
Or how things would've been between us
Want to give you so much! So much, so much, hmm

Reminiscing
