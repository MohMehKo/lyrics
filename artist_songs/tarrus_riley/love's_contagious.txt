Tell me something, something ah go 'round
Me have it, you have it
I got this feeling inside bubbling over
Don't need no doctor right ya know I need my lover

Ya can't resist, no escape
The feeling start creeping up coming your way
Can't do ah thing no matter what they say
Ya find yourself walking around daydreaming
Roses being red and violets blue
She loves me, yes, she loves me not, that's what you do
You cyaan get a grip and now you're acting foolish
Look in the mirror and say what's this

Looks like something ah go 'round, love's contagious
Something ah go 'round, but it's the sweetest sickness
Feeling inside bubbling over
You get a feeling inside bubbling over
Look like something a go 'round
Love's contagious, I don't need to be cured
Woman you fill my prescription, feel like a new man
You're like my vitamin you keep me coming
Ooh baby, you're my medicine
Woman I need you so, never letting you go
And when your love attacked me
I couldn't do a thing about it, no
Me na wan fi see no pharmacist no
Me just wan ya to come and treat me
Me na wan no doctor come drugs me no
All me wan ya do is diagnose me
Fill me up with all of your good stuff girl
Fill me up woman, I'm your patient
And I know it's real the way I feel

No defense ya might get hook
Start wonder if them tie yu or if it's love bush
Symptoms start show and now you got de look
It's like she need that medication
Now she need that juck
Scientists ah search fi find an antidote
Caan do a thing dem experiment all 'bout
So don't feel guilty, like it's a sin
A jus' di vibes an a regular thing

A likkle something ah go 'round, love's contagious
Something ah go 'round, but it's the sweetest sickness
Feeling inside bubbling over
And all I want is for my lover to come over
It's like something a go 'round, love's contagious
Something a go 'round, but it's the sweetest sickness
Feeling inside bubbling over
Don't need no doctor right ya know I need my lover
Me tell ya something a go 'round
Love's contagious, I don't need to be cured
Woman you fill my prescription, feel like a new man
You're like my vitamin C, you're my medicine
