[Verse 1:]
More time it frustrating
How you deal wid the grades is degrading
And wi nuh intoxicated no

Just true a spliff tail
You waan lock wi in a jail
But when it legalized
Will yo charge disappear

7 days her a find
But the evidence couldnâ€™t find
Now you waan mi spend the time a pay the find
And mi waan you fi gimmi bad mind

[Chorus:]
Gimmi my herbs
My skunk, my long sweat mice
Sensimena, my herbs

This a tripple og cush, shower desil
Mi need you, my herbs

Pepper mint leaf
Bubble life my serusi
Because a my herbs
Unuh gimmi back my herbs

[Verse 2:]
Pon ever level mi defending it
Yo want the knowledge, mi wi lend you it
If you believe in a medicine
This yah plant full a nough benefit
If you reading you bible
Look good you wi seet in a genesis
Babylon, on the pass dem a nemesis
But me and the herbs a nuh enemies

[Repeat Chorus 2x]
