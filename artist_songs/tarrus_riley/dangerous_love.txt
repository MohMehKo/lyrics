[Intro:]
I rather to live pon the house top
Than inna contention with mi woman
Mi rather plant greens inna the jungle
An fi a war wid mi girl every second

[Chorus:]
First shi love mi, den shi hate mi
Everyday mi feel like it war fi are
Wi fighting on the daily
Me an you together girl it unfair

Wi got a dangerous love woman
Wi got a dangerous love
What a dangerous love woman
Wi got a dangerous love

[Verse 1:]
Mi no want yo kill me or me kill you
Naw go go a prison an spend life through you
And mi naw look up inna no sun mi naw go mad through you
A rather see you sometime a rather pass through
Hey baby you no haffi lonely
The day yo seh yo done girl yo know seh I leave
Don't haffi gimmi no bun girl, no haffi run me
Instead a fighting pleas avoid me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Well I no waan fi be no victim this relationship sinking
An the same one yo kissing waan report yo missing
An mi naw go do yo nothing, an no mi naw go hurt you
But next man waan employ yo an start fi work you

I rather to live pon the house top
Than inna contention with mi woman
Mi rather plant greens inna the jungle
An fi a war wid mi girl every second

[Chorus x3]
