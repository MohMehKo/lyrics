In my dreams there's a place without war
No more guns no more pain no more hurt
It's a world full of joy without sadness
People sing people dance with all happiness

[Chorus]
Take me to my dream
Love is everything
Where there is no war
And then children sing
Love is all around
It's the only thing
In a dream that must come true

In my dreams there's a place where it's clean
No more waste in the air and the sea
So this place will be pure and all healthy
You can live your life in heaven

[Chorus]

But I know it's just a dream
Will it ever change this life?
Hope one day it'll turn around
Into the place that I dream about

Take me to this dream
Love is everything
Where there is no war
And the children sing
Love is all around
It's the only thing
In a dream that must come true
