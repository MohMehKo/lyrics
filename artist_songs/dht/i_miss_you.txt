Oh baby I know that I did you wrong
But I got lost along the way
And I never thought you'd walk away
But you did and I can't cope with it

[Chorus 2x]
I'm alone and I don't know what to do
With my feelings cause I'm still not over you
And I'm crying from the day you walked away
And I miss you
I miss you
(I miss you)

I tell my friends that I got over you
That I took your pictures of the wall
But I know there is another truth
That I miss you
That I need you

[Chorus 2x]
