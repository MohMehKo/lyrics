Dark outside early in the morning
In the cold standing on my own
I feel lost don't know where I'm going
Without you I'm all alone

Where are you and God why did you leave me
You were the one, to fill my life
Suddenly I can never see you
Torn away without goodbye

Why tell me why
What I want is another chance to show that I love you
That I need you
Cause I want you
By my side

I miss you, all the things about you
I wish that I could turn back time
Your soft touch all over my body
Just one thing on my mind
Where are you, and why did I lose you?
You were the one to fill my life
Suddenly I can never see you
Torn away without goodbye

Why tell me why
What I want is another chance to show that I love you
That I need you
Cause I want you
By my side
