I wander through the world
No meaning in my life
My mind is driving me insane
The hurt I've kept all years
So much want it to end
Don't want to live with this pain

I cannot follow through
As the down exceeds the joy
Provide my mind with a cure
As I need to get my high
The juice to help me fly
Is the cause of my sorrow and my pain

Oh god please let me go
Let me leave the misery
I'm so tired in my head
Can't keep on living like this
Cause I have no life you see
I shall end my own misery

Oh god please let me go
Let me leave the misery
I'm so tired in my head
Can't keep on living like this
Cause I have no life you see
I shall end my own misery

I wander through the world
No meaning in my life
My mind is driving me insane
