Tuh-Duhduh-Tuh-Tuh [x8]

When the sun is coming through 
I feel good
Sunshine all around
Where are you?

Close your eyes and listen [x2]

Tuh-Duhduh-Tuh-Tuh [x4]

I can sing night and day
Throw your hands up and sing
Come and Party all night long
Won't you join me in the song 

When the night is coming out
I feel good
Moonlight all around
But where are you

Close your eyes and listen [x2]

Tuh-Duhduh-Tuh-Tuh [x4]

I can sing night and day
Throw your hands up and sing
Come and Party all night long
Won't you join me in the song
