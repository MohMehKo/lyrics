Doin’ alright
A little jivin’ on a Saturday night
And come what may gonna dance the day away
Jenny was sweet
She always smiled for the people she’d meet
Trouble and strife
She had another way of looking at life
News is blue
Has no way to get to you
What can I do
When I remember my time with you

Driver’s seat (oh)
Driver’s seat (oh yea)
Driver’s seat (ooh)
Driver’s seat (oh yea)

Doin’ alright
A little jivin’ on a Saturday night
And come what may gonna dance the day away
Pick up your feet
Got to move to the trick of the beat
There is no elite
Just take your place in the driver’s seat
News is blue
Has no way to get to you
What can I do
When I remember my time with you

Driver’s seat (oh)
Driver’s seat (oh yea)
Driver’s seat (ooh)
Driver’s seat (oh yea)
