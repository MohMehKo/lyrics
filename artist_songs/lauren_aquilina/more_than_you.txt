Why is it always you
I come running back to
When I have a vacant heart?
Where am I going wrong?
I've wanted you for too long
I can't seem to restart

Had my piece of you
My fifteen minutes of shame
It was hell what I went through
Why do I wanna do it all again?

I don't know why I'm still here
You've had me chasing you for years
I don't know why I still care
But I do

I don't know what it it you've got
That I seem to want so much
But whatever it is it's stolen away my soul
I've never wanted anything more than you
More than you

I painted my face for you
Just like you asked me to
Like the other girls
You stole the sun from the sky
Sung me a lullaby
We were on top of the world

You left and then acted like
We never existed
Do you know how hard I tried
To be everything you wanted?

I don't know why I'm still here
You've had me chasing you for years
I don't know why I still care
But I do

I don't know what it it you've got
That I seem to want so much
But whatever it is, it's stolen away my soul
I've never cried over anyone more than you

I don't know why I'm still here
You've had me chasing you for years
I don't know why I still care
But I do

I don't know what it it you've got
That I seem to want so much
But whatever it is, it's stolen away my soul
I've never wanted anything more than you
More than you
