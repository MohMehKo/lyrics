Found myself in a house we've never been before
I'm wasted and I'm dancing dizzily
I know you would think I'm so far out of character
Cos you know me
I guess I came here looking for distraction
In a part of town we never used to go
Keep my body busy so my head might just forget
What my heart knows

And all I'm thinking about, is not thinking about you
All I'm thinking about, is not thinking about you
If only I could lose my mind
Then maybe I would find a way out
But all I'm thinking about, is not thinking about you

I'm thinking about you and you seem so unaffected
And I'm fighting not to feel, but nothing works
Been chasing temporary highs and strangers
And I'm tired
I don't know how emptiness can be this heavy
And your absence be so unavoidable
Funny how the hurt is never equal
When it all falls

Now all I'm thinking about, is not thinking about you
All I'm thinking about, is not thinking about you
If only I could lose my mind
Then maybe I would find a way out
But all I'm thinking about, is not thinking about you
I'm thinking about you
And all I'm thinking about, is not thinking about you
All I'm thinking about, is not thinking about you
If only I could lose my mind
Then maybe I would find a way out
But all I'm thinking about, is not thinking about you
I'm thinking about you
Not thinking about you
Not thinking about you
I'm thinking about you
