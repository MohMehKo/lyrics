[Verse 1:]
Who am I to tell you?
That you should stay.
When you're searching for the heat wave,
And, I am the rain.
Who am I to warn you?
When I'm one you're run-ning from.

'Cause I've done nothing wrong,
But I'll never be right.
So who am I, to put up, such a fight?

[Chorus:]
Your heart is filled with wanderlust,
Desire to go elsewhere.
It isn't me,
I'm not the one to take you there.
And I know you'll be happy,
And eventually I'll be fine,
But for now, I'll grit my teeth through the goodbye.

[Verse 2:]
This is what you want and,
I put you first,
I'd rather be your second,
Than be your worst.
Prioritise your feelings,
And you won't get hurt.
It's not like mine deserve any worse.

[Chorus:]
Your heart is filled with wanderlust,
Desire to go elsewhere.
It isn't me,
I'm not the one to take you there.
And I know you'll be happy,
And eventually I'll be fine,
But for now, I'll grit my teeth through the goodbye.

Oo-oo-hh

Oo-oo-ooo
Oo-oo-ooo

[Chorus 2:]
Your heart is filled with wanderlust,
Desire to go elsewhere.
It isn't me,
I'm not the one to take you there.
But they don't understand it,
And eventually I'll be fine,
But for now, I'll grit my teeth

[Chorus:]
Your heart is filled with wanderlust,
Desire to go elsewhere.
It isn't me,
I'm not the one to take you there.
And I know you'll be happy,
And eventually I'll be fine,
But for now, I'll grit, my teeth through the good-bye.
