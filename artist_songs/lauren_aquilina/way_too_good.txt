All too good, it's all too good
Half empty bottles of wine on my sink, and I am, I am
Far too gone, way too gone, I cannot think and I don't even care
No I don't

Wish that we could stay in this for life
Wish we could remain in this but I
I know better

Everything is way too good, way too good now
If nothing is meant to last, maybe we should drink to that
Cause it's way too good, way too good now
Morning's gonna come so fast, pour another drink in my glass

On the balcony, looking at the city
Everything seem to be so far away and I know, I know
It's all too good, all too good
You look at me like tomorrow could wait, lost in a haze

Wish that we could stay in this for life
Wish we could remain in this but I
I know better

Everything is way too good, way too good now
If nothing is meant to last, maybe we should drink to that
Cause it's way too good, way too good now
Morning's gonna come so fast, pour another drink in my glass

Don't need anything else, I don't wanna cry anymore tears
For everything, everything I've wasted
Don't need anything else, cause we got it all as long as we're here
But everything, everything is changing

Everything is way too good, way too good now
If nothing is meant to last, maybe we should drink to that
Cause it's way too good, way too good now
Morning's gonna come so fast, pour another drink in my glass
Cause it's way too good, way too good now
If nothing is meant to last, pour another drink in my glass
Pour another drink in my glass
