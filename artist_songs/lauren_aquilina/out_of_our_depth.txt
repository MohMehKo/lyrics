You'd love me to bits
If I wasn't already in pieces
I don't want you
But I don't wanna be without this
Gave you sign after sign
Time after time
Well we sink or swim
Treading this water 'til we descend
We never win
One more loss and I've lost to the end
We told lie after lie
Time after time

We're going really deep now
We're going really deep now
And I can't help it
We're out of our depth
Losing our breath
But don't you dare drown
Don't you dare go
Really deep now
We're going really deep now
And I can't help it
Out of our depth
Losing our breath
But don't you dare drown
Don't you dare

Paint doesn't last
But we dived in head second heart first
We could be the best
But I can't stop living in fear of the worst
Sleepless night after night
Time after time

We're going really deep now
We're going really deep now
And I can't help it
Out of our depth
Losing our breath
But don't you dare drown
Don't you dare
Going really deep now
We're going really deep now
And I can't help it
Out of our depth
Losing our breath
But don't you dare drown
Don't you dare

Don't you
Don't you
Don't you dare drown on me
Don't you dare drown on me

We're going really deep now
We're going really deep now
And I can't help it
Out of our depth
Losing our breath
But don't you dare drown
Don't you dare
Going really deep now
We're going really deep now
And I can't help it
Out of our depth
Losing our breath
But don't you dare drown
Don't you dare

(Deep now) Gave you sign (Deep now) after sign
Time after time (Deep now)
We told lie (Deep now) after lie
Time after time
