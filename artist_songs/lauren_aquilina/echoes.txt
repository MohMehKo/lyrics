Hands down, caught in the middle
You knew I was waiting for the light
But the days got dark for a little
And they can't see that you're trouble
You said you could change like fire to the rain
But the days stayed dark for a little

I cut my teeth on the words you speak
Getting lost in the echoes
And your young years cover up my ears
Getting lost in the echoes

Cause you built love inside a vacant home
You put my hand in yours
But I was never yours to hold
You knew my fears would always keep me here
You put my hand in yours
But I was never yours to hold
I was never yours to hold, no
I was never yours to hold, no

Head high, losing the battle
Cover up your own tracks and take it back
But your days got dark for a little
Found me foolish and fickle
Never change my mind, just gave up on a time
When the days got dark for a little

I cut my teeth on the words you speak
Getting lost in the echoes
And your young years cover up my ears
Getting lost in the echoes

Cause you built love inside a vacant home
You put my hand in yours
But I was never yours to hold
You knew my fears would always keep me here
You put my hand in yours
But I was never yours to hold

Never gonna give you hope
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna feel you in my bones
Cause I was never yours to hold
Never gonna lose control
Never gonna be the heart you stole
I'll be burning bright out on my own
Cause I was never yours to hold
I was never yours to hold

Cause you built love inside a vacant home
You put my hand in yours
But I was never yours to hold
You knew my fears would always keep me here
You put my hand in yours
But I was never yours to hold
I was never yours to hold, no
I was never yours to hold, no
