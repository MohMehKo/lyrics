I don't know who I am
And I don't know where I stand
So what else can I do
But follow lines in my hand?
Blow the candle, watch the smoke
Goodbye to you before I choke

Although I've never been
I've never come face to face
Rumours speak of the future
Like it's a scary place
Soaking my father's silhouette
The chaos I've come to regret

It's clear that I'm not ready for this

I can't live up to these expectations of me
They try to change me to what I'll never be
Long ago I withdrew my expectations of you
Unknown direction but it's where I'd rather be

They put the words in my mouth
But they don't like the taste
Their eyes just follow me round
Like I am such a disgrace
Their stares are dripping down my skin
Judgements are pouring their way in

It's clear that I'm not ready for this

I can't live up to these expectations of me
They try to change me to what I'll never be
Long ago I withdrew my expectations of you
Unknown direction but it's where I'd rather be

I thought that my path was sown by the stars
But I don't trust them anymore
Cause faking it cool and I'm just it's fool

I can't live up to these expectations of me
They try to change me to what I'll never be
Long ago I withdrew my expectations of you
Unknown direction but it's where I'd rather be

I can't live up to these expectations of me
They try to change me to what I'll never be
Long ago I withdrew my expectations of you
Unknown direction but it's where I'd rather be

Rather be, rather be
It's clear that I'm not ready for this
