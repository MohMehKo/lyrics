You promised me, we'd always be fine
Guess you lied
Cause now the whole world can hear our silence
And here we are, where we said we'd never be
You'd do anything for me
But how can you lift me up when you're on your knees

Its not that I don't want you
Its just I don't know how
To love you like I used to
So intense and so profound
And if I could change my feelings
I would forfeit all my bones
Cause your love is worth a fortune
But my heart's already broke

You could never be second best
But second chances are hard to find
When you damaged everything I had left

And here we are, where we said we'd never go
And I know I've been so cold
But pushing you away is how I cope

Its not that I don't want you
Its just I don't know how
To love you like I used to
So intense and so profound
And if I could change my feelings
I would forfeit all my bones
Cause your love is worth a fortune
But my heart's already broke

And if beggars can't be choosers
Then I'm begging you to choose
And if lovers can't be losers
Why do I always end up bruised?

Its not that I don't want you
Its just I don't know how
To love you like I used to
So intense and so profound
And if I could change my feelings
I would forfeit all my bones
Cause your love is worth a fortune
Yeah your love is worth a fortune
Yeah and those hardest to love need it most
But my heart's already broke
