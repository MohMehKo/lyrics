We were running off our midnight mouths
Saying things that we don't mean
When you're playing in the dark
Well, nothing's as it seems

It's just the lonely, just the lonely talking
So don't you tell me that you're falling for me now
It's just the lonely, just the lonely talking
So don't you tell me that you're falling for me

We're in too deep, so let go of my hand
Can't you see you mess with my head just because you can
Come for me, you're lying through your teeth
Could be anyone, you just want somebody
You just want somebody
It's just the lonely, talking

When you're messing with hell fire
Angels turn to anarchy
I wish what you said was true
But it's not reality

It's just the lonely, just the lonely talking
So don't you tell me that you're falling for me now
It's just the lonely, just the lonely talking
So don't you tell me that you're falling for me

We're in too deep, so let go of my hand
Can't you see you mess with my head just because you can
Come for me, you're lying through your teeth
Could be anyone, you just want somebody
You just want somebody
It's just the lonely, talking
You just want somebody

It's just the lonely, talking
It's just the lonely, just the lonely talking
It's just the lonely, talking
It's just the lonely, just the lonely talking

We're in too deep, so let go of my hand
Can't you see you mess with my head just because you can
Come for me, you're lying through your teeth
Could be anyone, you just want somebody
You just want somebody
It's just the lonely, talking
You just want somebody
