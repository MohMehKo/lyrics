So vast, so free,
These deep blue waters draw me in jealousy
I lost my head
Somewhere between the surface and the seabed
I'll stay beneath
Where my voice makes no noise trapped in my body
But when I leave,
Well I know that one day it's an ocean I'd be
And they call it freedom
How can it be?
When I live in a timezone not suited to me
And they call it freedom,
How can it be?
When we all follow patterns, and live on the beat
We all follow patterns, and live on the beat

So vast, so free,
These deep blue waters draw me in jealousy
I lost my head
Somewhere between the surface and the seabed
I'll stay beneath
Where my voice makes no noise trapped in my body
And they call it freedom,
How can it be?
When we all follow patterns, and live on the beat
We all follow patterns, and live on the beat

But when I leave,
Well I know that one day it's an ocean of free
Well I know that one day it's an ocean of free
Well I know that one day it's an ocean of free
