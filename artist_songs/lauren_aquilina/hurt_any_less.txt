5AM, in the rain
Waiting for you to explain
Why you don't think you can stay
Why my world's just gone insane

I remember the first time we were here
You told me all your darkest fears
And I fell apart

I knew this was coming from day one
Back there in September when we'd just begun
I was right, but I've never wanted to be so wrong

Why did you have to let me let you in?
I don't let many people under my skin
I know that this is for the best
But it doesn't Hurt Any Less
But it doesn't Hurt Any Less

People break each other's hearts
In their individual ways
You broke mine clean in half
When you let me stay

You made me feel so exposed
Asked for the feelings I held close
And I game them away

I knew this was coming from day one
This was never love, it was chaos
I was right, but I've never wanted to be so wrong

Why did you have to let me let you in?
I don't let many people under my skin
I know that this is for the best
But it doesn't Hurt Any Less
But it doesn't Hurt Any Less
I'm not what you thought you wanted
It was you who started this
I gave everything, expecting nothing
But it doesn't Hurt Any Less

You tell me you were mistaken
But you can't give back what you've taken
How does it feel to be keeping it all?
I can't see how there's a middle ground
I wanted you, but I want nothing now
I think I'd rather take the fall

Why did you have to let me let you in?
I don't let many people under my skin
I know that this is for the best
But it doesn't Hurt Any Less
But it doesn't Hurt Any Less
I'm not what you thought you wanted
But it was you who started this
I gave everything, expecting nothing
But it doesn't Hurt Any Less
