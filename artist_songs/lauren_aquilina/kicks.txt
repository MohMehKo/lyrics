We got mixed emotions
And that's when things get complicated
Victims of the loneliness
Find themselves in the darkest places

You've been using me
To get what you need
But you know how I feel 
It's nothing

Tell me where (hey)
Where do you get your kicks?
Is it from kicking me around
Cause it feels like that somehow

Tell me where (hey)
Where do you get you're fix?
I think I've figured you out
I'm done being down about this (hey)
I'm done being down about this (hey)
I'm done being down

We're not on the same page
Expectations never clear
You're just looking for an escape
So why the hell you still here

It's not me you need
It's just the company
But you know how I feel
It's nothing 

Tell me where (hey)
Where do you get your kicks?
Is it from kicking me around
Cause it feels like that somehow

Tell me where (hey)
Where do you get you're fix?
I think I've figured you out
I'm done being down about this (hey)
I'm done being down about this (hey)
I'm done being down

I got a heart that I can hear
Do you? Do you?
I can hear it loud and clear
Can you? Can you?

Tell me where (hey)
Where do you get your kicks?
Is it from kicking me around (stop kicking me around)
Cause it feels like that somehow

Tell me where (hey)
Where do you get you're fix?
I think I've figured you out
I'm done being down about this
I'm done being down about this
I'm done being down 
(stop kicking me around)
I'm done being down about this
I'm done being down (hey)
