Game after game we play
Our twisted snakes and ladders
Time for the rules to change
You're in my arteries
You're bolting through my body
I'll never be the same

So why won't you 
Talk to me?
Why won't you just talk to me?
There's a universe inside your head
Constellations of the things you left unsaid
Talk to me
Or watch me leave

Wave after wave of your meaningless conversation
Changing the subject again
Are you ever gonna wake up?
Are you ever gonna wake up?
Or are you gonna let me just walk away?

All you need to do is talk to me
Why won't you just talk to me?
There's a universe inside your head
Constellations of the things you left unsaid
Talk to me

You will bite your tongue until it bleeds
Hanging by the skin of your own teeth
Silence is your loudest scream
I don't know why you're hiding
You will bite your tongue until it bleeds
Hanging by the skin of your own teeth
Silence is your loudest scream
I don't know why you're hiding

Why won't you talk to me?
Why won't you just talk to me?
There's a universe inside your head
Constellations of the things you left unsaid
Talk to me

Why won't you talk to me?
Why won't you just talk to me?
There's a universe inside your head
Constellations of the things you left unsaid
Talk to me
