Trying to put my finger on this feeling
Can't remember what we came here for
Everything we try to say has hidden meaning
When you're the kind of tired that sleep can't cure

Time moves slow
Waiting for this to evolve
When hearts have nothing to hold
They let go
So what the hell are we waiting for?

Are we lovers or liars?
Are we burning up to keep this fire alive?
God loves a trier,
But there's nothing left to try
Lying to ourselves, lying to each other
Hiding from the truth, lying under covers
Are we lovers or liars?

Holding onto reasons I should keep you
When all the things you loved are now my flaws
We took apart our hands while we were sleeping
But will our dreaming be our downfall?

Are we lovers or liars?
Are we burning up to keep this fire alive?
God loves a trier,
But there's nothing left to try
Lying to ourselves, lying to each other
Hiding from the truth, lying under covers
Are we lovers or liars?

Should we lose everything we've got,
Or settle for something that we're not?
And all will be forgiven
If we go back
Can we go back?

Are we lovers or liars?
Are we burning up to keep this fire alive?
God loves a trier,
But there's nothing left to try
Lying to ourselves, lying to each other
Hiding from the truth, lying under covers
Are we lovers or liars?

Are we lovers or liars?
