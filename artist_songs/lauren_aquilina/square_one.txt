Trying too hard to put a smile on my face
When it feels so out of place
I'm being frozen by your flames

Thought you were human but you're just a ghost
A shield of skin and bones
I promise you won't feel a thing

It's not hard to let it go, 
when there's nothing to hold on to
I found hope when I lost you

I've forgotten who you are but I
I remember that's a good thing
On the dark side of my heart, oh I
I never saw you shining
It's not hard to come down
When we never left the ground
I've forgotten who you are but I
I remember that's a good thing

Through the cracks I see a new day burning
A million miles of sky
That I can claim as mine

It's not hard to let it go, 
when there's nothing to hold on to
I found hope when I lost you

I've forgotten who you are but I
I remember that's a good thing
On the dark side of my heart, oh I
I never saw you shining
It's not hard to come down
When we never left the ground
I've forgotten who you are but I
I remember that's a good thing

Back to square one but
I remember that's a good thing
When I forget to miss you
I remember that's a good thing
I was already half way home
When I knew that you were gone
Back to square one but
I remember, I remember that's a good thing

I've forgotten who you are but I
I remember that's a good thing
On the dark side of my heart, oh I
I never saw you shining
It's not hard to come down
When we never left the ground
I've forgotten who you are but I
I remember that's a good thing

When there's nothing to hold on to
I found hope when I lost you
