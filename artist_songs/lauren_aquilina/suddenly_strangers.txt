You always knew me
Better than anyone else I'd ever met
And that's what threw me
I think I lost myself the day you left

We used to stay up just to watch the date change to something new
Another day where I would have you

But how can it all change so fast
From everything to nothing just like that?
And all that time we'll never get back
You know I was never scared of the end
Only the way I knew we'd pretend
Like you and I were never even friends

From talking every waking hour
To not knowing where you are now
We're Suddenly Strangers
Isn't it strange?
And in the space you used to sleep
Are all those vows we couldn't keep
We're Suddenly Strangers
Isn't it strange?

I remember
The way you used to talk about your doubts
Like they were demons
I wonder if you still talk like that now

I used to say you were my home
But now the house is empty
And I'm sleeping alone

From talking every waking hour
To not knowing where you are now
We're Suddenly Strangers
Isn't it strange?
And in the space you used to sleep
Are all those vows we couldn't keep
We're Suddenly Strangers
Isn't it strange?

But how can it all change so fast
From everything to nothing just like that?
And all that time we'll never get back
You know I was never scared of the end
Only the way I knew we'd pretend
Like you and I were never even friends

From talking every waking hour
To not knowing where you are now
We're Suddenly Strangers
From talking every waking hour
To not knowing where you are now
We're Suddenly Strangers
Isn't it strange?
And in the space you used to sleep
Are all those vows we couldn't keep
We're Suddenly Strangers
Isn't it strange?

You always knew me
Better than anyone else I'd ever met
We're Suddenly Strangers
Isn't it strange?
