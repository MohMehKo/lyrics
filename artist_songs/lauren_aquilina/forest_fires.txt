I don't have much to say
There's nothing in this name
Sorry to disappoint again
Nobody pines for the listener
A thrill I've failed to deliver

And whilst I watch in silence
You're starting Forest Fires
You start them just to feel the heat
And whilst I keep my quiet
You're running with the tigers
You're running just to run from me

The people on this train
Already made up their minds about me
I can already feel their hate
The stranger, his sorrow
Must be fault of my own

And whilst I watch in silence
You're starting Forest Fires
You start them just to feel the heat
And whilst I keep my quiet
You're running with the tigers
You're running just to run from me

And I don't blame you...
And I don't blame you...
And I don't blame you...
Who would wanna be around me
Who would wanna be around me
Who would wanna be around me
