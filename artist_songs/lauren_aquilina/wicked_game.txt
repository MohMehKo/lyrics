I guess my problem's always been
Giving people everything
And expecting the same
He said he didn't do commitment
With tattoos on his skin
Maybe I wasn't worth the pain

Oh if only I, I could verbalise
What's really going on
I internalise and I don't know why
But it's taking it's toll

Nobody ever taught me to play
This Wicked Game
This wicked, Wicked Game
Nobody ever taught me to play
This Wicked Game
This wicked, Wicked Game
Where everything [x5]
Is just too much and I'm never enough
This Wicked Game
This wicked, Wicked Game

I keep my words inside my lungs
Bottle it all up
I've heard that's what the broken do
I don't know how to ask for help
Teach me to be someone else
Teach me to be somebody new

I've been thinking about death
But I'll hold my breath
And I'll bite my tongue
These are dark, dark times
But I know that I
I will be what I become

Nobody ever taught me to play
This Wicked Game
This wicked, Wicked Game
Nobody ever taught me to play
This Wicked Game
This wicked, Wicked Game
Where everything [x5]
Is just too much and I'm never enough
This Wicked Game
This wicked, Wicked Game

Nobody ever taught me to play
This Wicked Game
This wicked, Wicked Game
Nobody ever taught me to play
This Wicked Game
This wicked, Wicked Game
Nobody ever taught me to play
This Wicked Game
This wicked, Wicked Game
Nobody ever taught me to play
This Wicked Game
This wicked, Wicked Game
Where everything [x5]
Is just too much and I'm never enough
This Wicked Game
This wicked, Wicked Game
