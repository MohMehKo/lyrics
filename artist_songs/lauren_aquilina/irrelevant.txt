Let's start at the end
Becoming strangers once again
Or maybe that's all we ever were
Do you know how it feels
To crave a body made of steel
To give your all for no return

'Cause I've been running marathons
While you're still standing still
And I'd be anything for you
But I'll never fit the bill

'Cause I'm irrelevant
You'll be fine without me
And it's evident, it shows
And in your excellence
I forgot I used to have my own
You won't even notice that I'm gone

You consume my thoughts
I'm not sure that I'm in yours at all
Your mind is too far gone to see
The worst part of it all
Is that I desperately still want
Someone who never wanted me

'Cause you've been burning bridges while
I've been building homes
And I'm only your everything
When you feel alone
'Cause I'm irrelevant
You'll be fine without me
And it's evident, it shows
And in your excellence
I forgot I used to have my own
You won't even notice that I'm gone

Are the days that I'll cling to you
Throw me to the lions and start anew
And who the hell are you
For the hell you've put me through

But I'm irrelevant
You'll be fine without me
And it's evident, it shows
And in your excellence
I forgot I used to have my own
You won't even notice that I'm...
... gone
