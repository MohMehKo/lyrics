Who said that you could make a fool of me?
And treat me as if I’m not even here
Who said that you decide how I feel?
Who

Have you got blood running through your veins?
Do you feel love and can you feel pain
Who said it’s fine for you to shift the blame?
Who

While you were letting somebody in
Did you ever stop and think

How would you like it
If I tore you up into pieces
Tell me how would you like it
If I left you while you were sleeping
Now he’s got my dress on the floor
I breathe the name that isn’t yours
And let you go a little more
So how would you like it?

Who said that you could just mess with me?
Talk about her in the place we sleep
Who said I didn’t have the strength to leave?
Who

Did you really think that it would be ok?
Come home expecting nothing to change
Who said that I would look the other way?
Who

While you were underneath her skin
Did you ever stop and think

How would you like it
If I tore you up into pieces
Tell me how would you like it
If I left you while you were sleeping
Now he’s got my dress on the floor
I breathe the name that isn’t yours
And let you go a little more
So how would you like it?

Well I’m saying I will be the one to choose
I’m saying I won’t be the one who’s used
Hope you remember everything you loose
Who

How would you like it
If I tore you up into pieces
Tell me how would you like it
If I left you while you were sleeping
Now he’s got my dress on the floor
I breathe the name that isn’t yours
And let you go a little more
So how would you like it?

Whoaaa how would you like it
Tell me how would you like it
How would you like it?

Now he’s got my dress on the floor
I breathe the name that isn’t yours
Oh would you die a little more
So how would you like it?
