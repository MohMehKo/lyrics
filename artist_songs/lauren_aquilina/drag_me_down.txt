Sometimes I wonder
Why I'm still here
Light one more cigarette
Stub out my fear

Head under water
To block my ears
Of all the things I know
But I don't want to hear

Cause I can't be
Whatever you wan't to see
I can only be what I know how

And I won't go
Wherever you want to go
Cause it sounds like my idea of hell

So please don't drag me down

You got lost in the colours
They led you astray
I watch in helplessness 
As your mind decays

Society killed the teenager
Why on Earth would anyone stay
When you know Paradise is just one dose away

Cause I can't be
Anything you wan't to see
I can only be what I know how

And I won't go
Wherever you want to go
Cause it sounds like my idea of hell
So please don't drag me down

You think it's worth dipping your feet into the flames
Didn't you know the Devil always wins his games
Stop the lines and get in line it's all you have to give

You are dying to just to live
You are dying to just to live
You are dying to just to live
You are dying to just to live

And you will be whatever they want to see
You will always be what they want now
And you will go wherever they take you cause
You're a grade A in following the crowd

So please don't drag me down
So please don't drag me down

Please don't drag me down
Please don't drag me down
Please don't drag me down
Please don't drag me down
