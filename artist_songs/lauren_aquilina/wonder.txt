I can't control my feelings
I can't control my thoughts
I'm staring at the ceiling
Wondering how I got so caught

You're completely off limits
For more reasons than just one
But I can't stop

You're aware of my existence
But you don't know I'm here
You're the center of attention
You control the atmosphere

You're so busy being busy,
I don't want to interfere
But I can't stop

So I'll remain within your reign
Until my thoughts can travel somewhere new
My mind is blind to everything but you
And I wonder if you wonder about me too

If you were to stop talking
I don't know what I'd do
The future's far less daunting
Walking into it with you

So drink 'til you can't think and
Pretend I'm what you choose
'Cause I can't stop

So I'll remain within your reign
Until my thoughts can travel somewhere new
My mind is blind to everything but you
My mind is blind to everything but you
And I wonder if you wonder about me

So I'll remain within your reign
Until my thoughts can travel somewhere new
My mind is blind to everything but you
And I wonder if you wonder about me too
