When I am alone I sit and dream
And when I dream the words are missing
Yes, I know that in a room so full of light
That all the light is missing
But I don't see you with me, with me
Close up the windows, bring the sun to my room,
Through the door you've opened
Close, inside of me the light you see
that you met in darkness

Time to say goodbye
Horizons are never far
Would I have to find them alone,
Without true light of my own?
With you I will go
On ships over seas
That I now know
No, they don't exist anymore
It's time to say goodbye

When you were so far away
I sat alone and dreamt of the horizon
Then I knew that you were here with me, with me
Building bridges over land and sea
Shine a blinding light for you and me
To see, for us to be

Time to say goodbye
Horizons are never far
Would I have to find them alone
Without true light of my own?
With you I will go
On ships over seas
that I now know
No, they don't exist anymore
It's time to say goodbye
