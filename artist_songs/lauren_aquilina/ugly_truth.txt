This changes everything
I could tear your world to shreds
It don't mean anything
If I live to regret
Going through the motions
When there's no emotion left to feel
Left to feel

You don't know

You're so oblivious
To words I've never said
Isn't it obvious
That we would always get
To a place
Where we would make mistakes?
All you've seen is beauty, well
This is the ugly, this is the ugly truth

You're gonna feel the sting
From my black and yellow heart
The walls are caving in
They're not strong enough to last
We are void but open
To a life we've broken
Shall we leave?
Shall we leave?

You don't know

You're so oblivious
To words I've never said
Isn't it obvious
That we would always get
To a place
Where we would make mistakes?
All you've seen is beauty, well
This is the ugly, this is the ugly truth

This is the ugly
This is the ugly truth

You're so oblivious
To words I've never said
Isn't it obvious
That we would always get
To a place
Where we would make mistakes?
All you've seen is beauty, well
This is the ugly, this is the ugly truth
This is the ugly truth
This is the ugly truth
