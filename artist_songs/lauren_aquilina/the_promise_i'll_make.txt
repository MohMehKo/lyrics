Strip me down ‘till it’s just my bones
We look different but we share this home

Underneath it all
I’m a skeleton; you’re a skeleton
I can only hope  
I can offer you some protection

I’m so sorry
This world could not keep you safe
I’m sad and I’m angry
I’m looking for words but I can’t explain it

It won’t wash the blood from their heads
But I will love you as hard as I can
Try and make the world understand 
Something needs to change

That’s the promise I’ll make
That’s the promise I’ll make
That’s the promise I’ll make
That’s the promise I’ll make

I don’t know what it’s like in your shoes
I can only imagine what you’re going through

Underneath it all
I am human; you are human
I don’t understand 
Their delusion, the confusion
I’m so sorry
This world could not keep you safe
I’m sad and I’m angry
I’m looking for words but I can’t explain it

It won’t wash the blood from their heads
But I will love you as hard as I can
Try and make the world understand 
Something needs to change

If we all start doing something
Maybe this won’t happen again
If we all start doing something
Loving all strangers, treating them like friends

I’m so sorry
This world could not keep you safe
I’m scared and I’m angry
Looking for words but I can’t explain it

It won’t wash the blood from their heads
But I will love you as hard as I can
Try and make the world understand 
Something needs to change

That’s the promise I’ll make
