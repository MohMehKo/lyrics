Life is a song worth singing
Why don't you sing it?
Life is a song worth singing
Why don't you sing it?

You hold the key in the palm of your hand, use it
Don't blame your life on the master plan, change it

Only you generate the power
To decide what to do with your life
You're a fool if you think you're helpless
You control what you do with your life

Life is a song worth singing
Why don't you sing it?
Life is a song worth singing
Why don't you sing it?

Don't like the way you're living, too bad
Can't change your life 'cause it's out of your hand, so sad

So you sit on your pants and holler
'Cause the world ain't been treating you right
Don't you know you contain the power
To control destiny with your mind

You control what you do with your life
You're a fool if you think you're helpless
Can't change your life 'cause it's out of your hand, so sad, no

You got the power, use it, use it
You got to control destiny with your mind
Right here, right here, right here
You decide what to do with your life, well, well

Life is a song worth singing
