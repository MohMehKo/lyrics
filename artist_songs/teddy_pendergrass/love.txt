Love, I've waited all my life to find you
I've searched for you in every dream
And suddenly
You reached out to me

Oh love, I remember when I first touched you
I remember how my heart had wings
To said upon
Tell me what went wrong

Oh love, when you were just within my reach
I was blind
To find my dreams of being free

Oh love, it's not too late for you and me
There's still time
As long as we believe
Believe in love

I thought that I could live without you
I really thought that I was strong
But now you're gone
I'm not half as strong

Oh love, I never knew how much I missed you
I never knew I had to give to you
To keep you hear
Now, I need you here

Oh love, when you were just within my reach
I was blind
To find my dreams of being free

Oh love, it's not too late for you and me
There's still time
As long as we believe
Believe in love

I never knew how life could fade away
A little bit more each day
Without you
I'm twice the fool

Oh love, believe me when I say I'm sorry
We've got to find a way to start all over
'Cause it's not over
For me and you

Oh love, you were just within my reach
I was blind
To find my dreams of being free

Free, is just the way to say goodbye
But I was wrong
I really need you by my side

Oh love, start to rain for you and me
There is still time
As long as we believe

Leaving love, it start to rain for you and me
Leaving love, as long as we believe
Leaving love, it start to rain for you and me
Leaving love
