Oh love,
I’ll never find the words on my own
This loneliness won’t leave me alone
Oh yeah, alone

Since you been gone
I’ve traveled ’round this world with a song
Searchin’ for the right and the wrong
I’m still alone

Now I know baby
I’ll never see heaven again, Oh no
Now I know baby
I’ll never see heaven again, Oh no
No more

Dreams
Are made for those who wish on a star
Like boys who dream of landing on Mars
They never go

I must have lost
The feeling that you’re never alone
Somewhere along the way I went wrong
It’s been so long

Now I know baby
I’ll never see heaven again, Oh no
Now I know baby
Never see heaven again, Oh no
No more

Without your sweet love baby
I’ll never see heaven again, Oh no
See I need you right here beside me
Never,never see it again
No more
Baby, I’ll never see heaven again
See I need you by my side
Never see heaven again Oh no
No more
I’ll never see heaven again Oh no
Now I know baby
I’ll never see it again, no no
Without your sweet love baby
I’ll never see heaven again Oh no
See I need you here beside me
See I’ll never never
Never never never never never never never
I’ll never see heaven again no no
See I’ll never, I’ll never
I’ll never see it again, no no
Without your sweet love babe
Without your goodness
Without you right here beside me
