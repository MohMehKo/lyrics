Where I'm going?
I've been lost so long,
There's no shelter from the cold,
Winds are blowing,
I keep dreaming on,
Waking up in emptiness alone, alone,
I know, I know,

Somewhere I belong,
Somewhere I can call, my home,
Open your heart to me,
I've got the feeling,
That your love is leading me home.

How'd you find me?
Pull me from the storm,
Make the heartache disappear,
Feel the fire,
Love can keep us warm,
I just can't believe I'm finally here,
I am here, I am here,

Somewhere I belong,
Somewhere I can call, my home,
Open your heart to me,
I've got the feeling,
That your love is leading me, leading me home,
Somewhere I belong.

Open your heart to me,
I've got the feeling, I've got the feeling,
That your love, your love, is leading me home,
Somewhere I belong,
Somewhere I belong,
Somewhere I can call, I can call, my home,
Open your heart, open your heart, to me, to me,
I've got the feeling, I've got the feeling,
That your love, that your love is,
Leading me, leading me home.
Somewhere I Belong.
