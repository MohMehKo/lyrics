I've been so many places
I've seen so many things
But none quite as lovely as you

More beautiful than the Mona Lisa
Worth more than gold
And my eyes have the pleasure to behold

You're my latest and my greatest
My latest, my greatest inspiration

Things never looked clearer
Peace within never felt nearer
My burden's gone, it's turned into a song

Tender as a baby's touch
I needed you, oh, so much
At last the load is so light

You're the latest and my greatest
My latest, my greatest inspiration

I plan to give you all that I have
I'll be everything, everything you think I am
You make life a joy to live
And I'm thankful, yes, I'm blessed just to know you

I've been so many places
I've seen so many things
But none quite as delectable as you
More beautiful than the Mona Lisa
Worth more than gold
And my eyes have the pleasure just to behold

You're my latest, tell you you're my greatest
My latest, my greatest inspiration
You inspire me, inspire me
Don't you know, my latest, my greatest inspiration

You keep just keep on liftin' me up now
