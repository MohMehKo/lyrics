Baby, send the kids to bed
Spend the time with me instead
Here's our chance to be alone
No friends, no phone

See time is passed unknown
You and I always on the go
And now we must take some time
To do things on my mind

Oh, I've just got to make love
I wanna make sweet love to you, girl
Now the time is come to share the pleasures
Of love our bodies feel inside

It'll be wonderful, it'll be marvelous
And you know I love you, tender
I just wanna love you so tender

Oh, I need to feel every part of you
In spite of all the things that our lives go through
And if by chance that you don't believe
Then baby, I got to say that our love is real
See I'm your man and I've just got to let you know
That I wanna give you so much pleasure

Pour a glass of wine for two
While I get you in the mood
Our night of ecstasy has begun

We'll take our time and take it slow
Making love from head to toe
Oh, what I've got in store for you
Is anything you want me to do

It'll be incredible
Having you laying next to me
I'll be so gentle as I love you completely

It'll be wonderful, it'll be marvelous
And you know I love you, tender
