Somebody told me to deliver this message
I'm sure you know whom I'm talking about.

You see, He sees the world is full of confusion
People not knowing who to trust
No, He's wondering why we still can't be
In this world He gave us.

It's about time we submit to the master plan
And bring all this pain and war to an end
Well, He said it's about time for a brand new day; and a brand new world to begin.

Somebody told me
(Somebody told me to deliver this message)
And I pass it on, pass it to you
(Somebody told me to deliver this message
I'm sure you know who, you know who.

You see, she's a child who's dying of hunger
And another man just looking good
Yea, He's wondering why that man hasn't need for thought for about loving that baby if he could

He woke me up this morning – yes He did
And this is what He had to say:
He said, “Get on up; go out and tell the world
That this day is a brand new day”
He woke me up
(Somebody told me to deliver this message)
He said pass it on, pass it on

It's about time we submit to the master plan
And bring all this pain and war to an end
Well, He said it's about time for a brand new day; and a brand new world to begin

Somebody woke me up this morning and told me to tell you
(Somebody told me to deliver this message)
He said pass it on to you
(Somebody told me to deliver this message)
And I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure you know who
(Somebody told me to deliver this message)
You see, it's a brand new day, brand new, brand new
(Somebody told me to deliver this message)
He gave His only begotten son
So that you and I can live
You and I, You and I, You and I can live

Well
You see a long time ago
When I was about 10 years old
Speaking:
If you read in Proverbs 25:13
You'd see where it says:
As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him:
For he refresheth the soul of his masters.
He said get on up, get on up
Get on up, go out and tell the world

(Somebody told me to deliver this message)
That the time is coming; time is coming
When the world will have to come to an end.
(Somebody told me to deliver this message)
Ah, you better be ready; you better be ready
Ah, Time waits for no one, no
You better be ready children
You got to be ready
