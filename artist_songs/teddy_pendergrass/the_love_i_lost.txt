The love I lost was a sweet love
The love I lost was complete love
The love I lost, I will never
No, no, never love again

I can remember planning
Building my whole world around you
I can remember hoping
That you and I could make it on through

But something went wrong
We loved each other, we just couldn't get along
Take a good look at me
I'm in misery, can't you see?

The love I lost was a sweet love
The love I lost was complete love
The love I lost
I will never, no, no, never love again

I can't remember nothing, no, no, no
But the good times we used to share, my love
I'm so sad and lonely
But without you, my life is so dead

I'm sorry to say
You go your way and I'll go my way
It hurts deep inside
The day we said goodbye, but

The love I lost was a sweet love
The love I lost was complete love
The love I lost
I will never, no, no, never love again

Never, no, no, never love again
Never, no, no, never love again
Never, no, no, never love again
Never, no, no, never love again
