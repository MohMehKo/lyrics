Threads that weave together
In a tapestry of life
Meant to last forever
I promised you forever

I look up at the moon above our darkened room
The silence almost hurts
And though my words are well rehearsed
Can't seem to find the courage or the will to walk away
I wish that I was strong enough to say

I know it's over for me baby
There's no easy way to start
To say the words, they'll break your heart
I know it's over for me baby
It tears me up to see it die
I don't know how, I don't know why
It's over

Guess heaven only knows how people once so close
Wake up to find it gone
Not knowing what on earth went wrong
Now to look you in your eyes
Is the hardest thing I'll ever do
To bring myself to tell you
To hurt you with the truth

I know it's over for me baby
There's no easy way to start
To say the words, they'll break your heart
I know it's over for me darlin'
It tears me up to see it die
I don't know how, I don't know why

You smile, you understand
You should be hating me for living
Instead you're so forgiving

Oh baby, oh baby
I've got to tell you somehow
Somehow I've got to let you know

Are you know it's over for me baby
There's no easy way to start
To say the words, they'll break you heart
I know it's over for me darlin
It tears me up to see it die
I don't know why, I don't know how

Are you know it's over for me baby
There's no easy way to start
To say the words, they'll break you heart
I know it's over for me darlin
It tears me up to see it die
I don't wanna make you cry

Oh no, no no no...
