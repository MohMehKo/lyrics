There comes a time
When a man has to answer
For the things that he's done
No one to, no one can answer to
No one but the Man up above

See I have to live my life
But when it's all said and done
No matter what no one says

I'm still my Father's child
Oh yes, I am
And I know He'll take good care me

I'm still my Father's child
Oh yes, I am
I know, I know that He will
Take good care of me

When I'm alone
And I need someone that I can talk to
I hold, I hold out my hand
And I know I can say
I can say anything that's on my mind
Oh yes, I can, alright

See when things are going wrong
And there's trouble in my life
See I call out His name 'cause I know

I'm still my Father's child
Oh yes, I am, alright
And I know He'll take good care me

See, I'm still my Father's child
Oh yes, I am
I just wanna testify
He will, He will
Take good care of me, oh yeah

Anything I can ever need, that He's there
My Father, my Father
He carries me on His shoulder
And when I'm weak
He lifts me up, lifts me up

'Cause I'm still my Father's child, oh yeah
And I know that He's a part of me
No matter what I do, no matter what I say
I know, I know that He will
Take good care of me

I'm my Father's child, oh yeah
I'm still my Father's child
Even when I'm up and even when I'm down
I?m still my Father's child, oh yeah
All I have to do is say
Father, Father

Father's child, Father, Father
Father's child, Father's child
Father's child
