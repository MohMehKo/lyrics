Yesterday, huh
Hey, it could have been forever
Say goodbye, why?
Should have stayed together

Even now I find
You're always on my mind
And after all we've been through
Baby, it's still you

And I want you back in my life
It's empty here without you
I want you back in my life
I'm always thinking 'bout you

I want you back in my life
Why did I ever doubt you?
Girl, it's been too long
You belong in my life

Feel the chill, still girl, when I'm around you
(Yes, I feel the same)
Could it be we could love the way we used to?
(Yeah, I can feel the flame)

Yes, I've seen enough
To know that this is love
Chance, we've got to take it
Girl, we gonna make it

And I want you back in my life
It's empty here without you
I want you back in my life
I'm always thinking about you

I want you back in my life
Why did I ever doubt you?
Girl, it's been too long
(Been too long)
You belong in my life, oh, baby

I want you back in my life
I want you back in my life
(Oh, baby, hey)
I want you back in my life
I want you back in my life
(Been so long since we've been together)

I want you back, I want you back
I want you back, I want you back
I want you back, I want you back
(Baby, baby)
Boy, it's been too long
You belong in my life

I want you back in my life
(It's empty here without you)
I want you back in my life
(I'm always thinking about you)

I want you back in my life
(Why did I ever doubt you?)
Boy, it's been too long
You belong in my life

I want you back in my life
(I want you here with me, baby)
I want you back in my life
(Tired of being alone all by myself)

I want you back in my life
(Oh baby, I'm needing you, thinking about you)
Thinking about you
(Thinking about you)
Thinking about you
(Oh, baby)

I want you back, I want you back
(So empty here without you)
I want you back, I want you back
(Oh yeah)
I want you back, I want you back
Boy, it's been too long
You belong in my life

I want you back, I want you back
(I don't know why I ever doubted you)
I want you back, I want you back
(I was a fool to ever leave you, baby)

I want you back, I want you back
(Would you come back, would you come back?)
Boy, it's been too long, you belong in my life
(Back in my life, baby)
