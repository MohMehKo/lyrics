It used to be every night 
I would cry my heart out over you, 
It used to be every day 
I would wish you here close to me. 

I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, 
I'd just sit at home and I'd weep, 
but now all that has changed, 
I've found someone to ease my pain 

And it don't (hurt now no not now) 
baby it don't hurt now (no not now) 
well there's no more sleepless nights 
no more heartaches, no more fights, 
and it don't (hurt now, not now) 

It used to be every time 
I would hear a sad song, I would die. 
It remind, me of when you and I 
were sooooo much in love 

I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, 
I'd just sit at home and I'd weep, 
but now all that has changed, 
I've found someone to ease my pain 

(And it don't) nooooo (hurt now, no not now) 
trying to tell you, (baby it don't hurt now, no not now) 
Well there's no more sleepless nights 
no more heartaches and no more fights, 
(and it don't hurt now) no it don't (not now) yeah 

[Instrumental]

See there's no more sleepless nights 
no more heartaches and no more fights 
now all that has changed 
I've found someone to ease my pain (And it don't) nooo (hurt now, no not now) 
trying to tell you woman, (baby it don't) it don't (hurt now) no (no not now) 
see there's no more sleepless nights no more heartaches
and no more fights and it don't (hurt now) no it don't (not now)
