And if I had someone to love me
And if I had someone who really cared
I would be the best lover that they ever had
Cause I need somebody to love me, love back (yes I do)
(hey hey hey)

And if I had one sunny day
And if I had someone to chase my blues away
I would be, I would be the luckiest man
In the whole wide world...
Cause I need somebody to love me, love be back
See I need to lose I need to lose this empty feeling
(this empty feeling)
Someone to start to need somebody to stop to stop these endless nights
I need some to love (would hold me) and hold real tight (would hold me)
Somebody to love me (would home me would hold me hold me hold) heeeeyyy
Somebody just to love me
If I only had if I only had someone that uh
I need I need somebody (just to hold my hand) somebody somebody
Heeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyy.......iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
