Once upon a time in my life
I thought that I had found the perfect love
(what I though was love wasn't really love at all)
I gave my heart to that love, love I thought would never part from me
(All I do is pray) I pray (hoping for a better day) oh yes
(through the falling rain) through the falling rain
(through the hurt and pain) love stays the same, true love stays the same
(true love never leaves) never leaves (when changes come) when changes come (true loves stays the same) yes
True love will never change
It stays the same
It never change

Like an old cliche
Good things come to those who truly wait
(constantly remember) oh yeah (love is not a fantasy) no no no no
now I live with peace of mind leaving all those lonely lonely lonely tears behind
(No more do I cry) oh no (happiness lives inside), happiness lives inside
(through the falling rain) through the falling rain
(through the hurt and pain) through the hurt and pain
(love stays the same), yes, true love, true love, stays the same
(true love never leaves) never never (when changes come) never never
(true loves stays the same) oooh, true love, true love
It stays the same
It never change
It stays the same
True love stays the same

Now I live with peace of mind leaving all those lonely lonely lonely tears behind
(No more) no more do I cry (happiness) happiness lives inside
(through the falling rain) through the falling rain
(through the hurt and pain) through the hurt and pain
(love stays the same) true love stays the same
if you got true love
(true love never leaves) it wont go nowhere (when changes come) (true loves stays the same) oooh, true love
It stays the same
Never change
It stays the same
Never change
It stays the same
Never change
