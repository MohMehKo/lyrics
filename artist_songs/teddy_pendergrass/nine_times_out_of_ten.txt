Nine times out of ten 
I'm falling in love with you 
Starting to need you more 
As time goes by 

Nine times out of ten 
I'm falling in love with you 
Starting want you more 
As time goes By 

Since the day I met you 
I feel so good inside 
My world has come alive 
Since I've known you, known you 

I can't forget you 
Your always on my mind 
I've got this strong desire 
To be near you 

Nine times out of ten 
I'm falling in love with you 
Starting to need you more 
As time goes by 

Wanna get to know you 
I call you on the phone 
I feel so all alone 
Me here and you there 

You gave my life reason 
You make my puzzle fit 
Oh I've got love to give 
And i wanna give it to you 

Nine times out of ten 
I'm falling in love with you 
Starting to need you more 
As time goes by 

[Solo Instrumental]

I say nine times out of ten 
I'm falling in love with you 
Starting to need you more 
As time goes by 

Nine times out of ten 
I'm falling in love with you 
Starting to need you more 
as time goes, time go-oh-goes by-y-y-y 

I say this time, this time 
I'm falling in love-love-love-love with you 
I'm pretty sure i need you more 
As time goes by
