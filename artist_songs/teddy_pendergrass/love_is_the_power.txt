It's been a long time coming, you brought my love back to life with your lovely smile baby.
Searched the world over, there's no other I rather love than now.
Since you came and brought me love, you've erased all the hurt and pain I've known.
Mmmm,and I'm still in need of you.
Bring that back to life baby, your love is the power baby

[Chorus:]
Your love, your love
Love is the power, this is the hour
The moment, the minute.
Your love is the power baby, this is the hour 
The moment, the minute

I turned the world over, round and round again, mmmm trying to find the one to be my angel heaven sent.
Then you brighten up my life, girl you make my whole world right, you are the one.
You're my everything baby, cause when I turn to you, you knew how to love me (you love me, you love me).
You gave me my dream and my song, how I long to sing.
See now I'm not so alone, I keep you living in my heart baby, I can feel it way deep down in my soul.

[Chorus 2x]

Ohhhh yeah 
Come on to me
I wanna tell you about your love oh yes I do
It's the moment, it's the minute
See now it's the time to give you all my loving, awww yes it is
Come on it's the minute
And I don't mind giving you just what you need
My, my, my, my 

Music breaks
Come back to the chorus....

I don't mind telling the world about how you make me feel see I...I...I searched the world over and over and over and over again but I never found nobody like you.
Aaaaaw, that, that can do all of the things that you do, that you do, that you do, that you do!
Aww, aww, aww baby and every time that we make love I can feel the chills running up and down my spine
Oh yes I do, I love it, I want it, I need it! Right now, right now!
Right now I feel the need of you. I want you baby, I need you baby.
I got so many things in my mind, so many things I wanna try right now, right here, with you!
You and me, me and you
You don't know what you do to me but I don't mind, I'll tell the whole world about this thing
I never felt like this before
