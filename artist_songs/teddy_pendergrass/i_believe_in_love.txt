Don't you know that we can't worry about
The things they say
'Cause they can't change the way we feel, oh no
What we have is more than they'll ever know
'Cause what we have is all so real

Alright, I can't go a single day
Without you and all the things that you do all night
Girl, you make a blind man see
My eyes are opened, now, I want you here with me

If you believe in love
I will never let you down
If you believe in love
I will always be around

Ever since that day I laid my eyes on you
I knew you were the one for me, oh yeah
Rarely does that lightning strike same place twice
I'll be a fool if I ever let you leave, girl

Never in this whole wide world
Would I ever find a woman like you, no no
You don't have to waste your time in worrying
'Cause girl I'm here to stay, I ain't goin' no place

If you believe in love
I will never let you down
If you believe in love
I will always be around

Tell me, baby
Tell me darling
Believe in love, believe in love
Don't you believe in love, believe in love
Don't you believe in love

Never in this whole wide world
Would I ever find a woman like you, baby
You don't have to waste your time in worrying
'Cause girl I'm here to stay, I ain't goin' no place
I'm gonna be right here, baby

If you believe in love
I will never let you down
If you believe in love
I will always be around

If you believe in love
I will never let you down
If you believe in love
I will always be around

If you believe in love
I will never let you down
If you believe in love
I will always be around

If you believe in love
I will never let you down
If you believe in love
I will always be around

If you believe in love
I will never let you down
If you believe in love
I will always be around
