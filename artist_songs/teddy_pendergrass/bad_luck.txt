Well, well
Look down-hearted and confused
Because lately you've been startin' to lose
Losin' out on everything, you might try to do
Bad luck's there, it's got a hold on you

Don't send you money, 'bout to lose your home
Done lose your woman and everything you own
Love always plainly states that chances go around
But if you wanna know the truth about it
And tell you what's pullin' you down, yeah

You got bad luck
That's what you got, that's what you got
(Yes, uh)
Bad luck
That's what you got, that's what you got
Bad luck
That's what you got, that's what you got
You got bad luck, bad luck

Played a number 'cause that number's hot
But the bookers gets you for every cent you've got
Walk around in a daze with your pockets bare
Got to see your woman and she ain't even there

Don't seem to give a whiz about it and all your trapped in time
The more I think about it, I think you're 'bout to lose your mind
Some people call it jinxed, some say it ain't my day, huh
But if you wanna know the truth about it
And tell you what's pullin' you way down

Bad luck
That's what you got, that's what you got
(Yes, uh)
Bad luck
That's what you got, that's what you got

You got bad luck
That's what you got, that's what you got
You got bad luck, bad luck
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad

One long week
Ooh, huh, yeah, yeah
One more thing

Love always plainly states that chances go around
But if you wanna know the truth about it
And tell you what's pullin' you down
Down, down, down, down, down

Bad luck
(Yes, uh)
That's what you got, that's what you got
You got bad luck
(Oh, yeah)
That's what you got, that's what you got

People in the world out there
I know none y'all satisfied, satisfied
The way crisis has been goin' on, oh, babe
I better say I'm just mad about mornin' paper, yeah
They cut down on smokin', we have to cut down on dreamin'

'Cause early one morning I got me a paper, huh
I sat down on my living room floor
Opened it up opened it up, guess, what I saw, huh?
Saw the President of the United States
The man said he was gonna give it up
He's giving us high hopes

But he still turned around and left all us poor folks behind
They say they got another man to take his place
But I don't think they need to satisfy the human race
Bad luck, bad luck, bad luck
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

The only the thing that I got that I can hold on
Is my God, huh, my God, huh
Jesus be with me, Jesus
Give me good luck, good luck
Help me Jesus, huh, everybody needs
