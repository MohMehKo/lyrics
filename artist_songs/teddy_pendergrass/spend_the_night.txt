I can tell that you need someone in your life
That truly understands everything that you need
A man that can bring out all the things inside of you
That no one else has been able to see now

We're not children and this no childish game
Wish you'd let me touch you, you'll never ever be the same
We don't take advantage of this precious time
We have no one else to blame except you and I

Spend the night, spend the night with me
All your fantasies, you can share with me
Spend the night, spend the night with me
I'll take care of you, baby, you will see so much love

Say ain't it funny how things just seem to work out?
You know there are those things in life that we could never ever explain
So while I sit around tryin' to come up with an explanation
With a way that we both feel is drivin' us insane yeah

If you feel a least bit of doubt about anything I say
Don't take my word, I'll tell you in a different way
I'm the man who said, ?Come go with me
Turn out the lights and close the door?
I'll give you everything you want and a whole lot more

Spend the night, spend the night with me
All your fantasies, you can share with me
Spend the night, spend the night with me
I'll take care of you, baby, you will see so much love

Spend the night, spend the night with me
All your fantasies, you can share with me
Spend the night, spend the night with me
I'll take care of you, baby, you will see so much love

Spend the night, spend the night with me
All your fantasies, you can share with me
Spend the night, spend the night with me
