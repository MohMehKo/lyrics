Oh love I've waited all my life to find you 
I've searched for you in every dream 
and suddenly you reached out to me 
oh love I remember when I first touched you 
I remember how my heart had wings to said upon 
tell me what went wrong 

Oh love when you were just within my reach 
I was blind to find my dreams of being free 
oh love it's not too late for you and me 
there's still time as long as we believe 
Believe in love 
I thought that I could live without you 
I really thought that I was strong 
but now you're gone 
I'm not half as strong 
oh love I never knew how much I missed you 
I never knew I had to give to you 

To keep you hear 
now I need you here 
oh love when you were just within my reach 
I was blind 
To find my dreams of being free 
oh love it's not too late for you and me 
there's still time 
as long as we believe believe 
believe in love 
I never knew how life could fade away 
a little bit more each day 
without you I'm twice the fool 
oh love 
believe me when I say I'm sorry 
we've got to find a way to talk things over 
cause it's not over 
Believe in love 
oh love......
