[Verse 1:]
This goes for Mrs. What's-Her-Name
Something changed, before the money came
You got real Shady, Aftermath
I was passed reminiscing about our past
Claim you don't remember it
But when I but when I told your friends
In the most immanent, details
Now you wanna censor shit
Trying to fix bits and pieces of what's left of it
Even when it's fixed
It's still relevant
True love is so hard to find
And they say that once you found it you lost your mind
Even some of my niggas grew apart with time
Truthfully I needed this space
You're far too kind
I guess I gotta let it be
The gang said I gotta big year ahead of me
Jack told me, that world you'll see eventually
And my worse enemy, is praying for the best for me
Dreams money can buy
When you fall in love, then realize love is a lie
And I guess that it was lust that flooded my eyes
Slim waist, thick cake, lovable thighs
I put that on the name of king
I'm a first class nigga, coach told me to make the team
Fuck chasing cheese
Homie, I'm chasing dreams
And fans make up for the rest like mabeleene

[Verse 2:]
And I'm the bad guy yet again
Spend so much time trying to find who the victim is
And if we put it in the eyes of the witnesses
I still get the blame for fucking up and beginning shit
You told me you was over that, grow up
And you say you saw us holding hands, so what?
If you can't look me in my eyes and respect me enough
Then I guess you getting left in the dust
With no feedback
Having late night conversations
Contemplating, both knowing that my time is wasted
Mood swings all time of the day
With childish behavior admitting that I was kinda complacent
And knowing this could be the end of it
Three months and she still ain't send a hint
Now she fucking with the next nigga claiming it's her friend and shit
You really take me for that much of a fool huh?
I had bitches on hold for a long time
To hear the perfect reason to just give them the walk sign
So you could talk your shit and I'm a talk mine
And hit me when you finish cause this is the fourth time
I've crossed your line when you crossed my mine
You crossed my mind just looking at the first time
I can't stress it no harder then this
And I forgot to tell you, karma's a bitch
High school girls be acting all retarded and shit
Ignoring my shit, I know you see me calling you miss
And if I call you a bitch, it must of slipped out
I got caught in the mist, and then you slipped out
With me, hit the rock hard enough and stopped getting a lot of changed in the game
So I'm gonna have to pull a pissy brown
I'm gonna laugh when they Rihanna on your ass
Cause you love it when you bind up and gagged right?
Remember that time in the bathroom?
I left it on your lower back like a tattoo
I'm just letting off mad fumes
And I'm gonna have to fill the shoes of this bad dude
