And you're like a nineties Jesus
And you revel in your psychosis
How dare you?
And you sample concepts like hors d'oevres
And you eat their questions for dessert

Is it just me or is it hot in here?

And you're like a nineties Kennedy
And you're really a million years old
You can't fool me
They'll  throw opinions like rocks in riots
And they'll stumble around like hypocrites

Is it just me or is it dark in here?

Well you may never be or have a husband
You may never have or hold a child
You will learn to lose everything
We are temporary arrangements

Ai-yi-yi...

And you're like a nineties Noah
And they laughed at you as you packed all of your things
And they wonder why you're frustrated
And they wonder why you're so angry

And is it just me or are you fed up?

Ai-yi-yi...

And God bless you in your travels
In your conquests and your queries
