Bring on the Tequila oh 
On fire on Tequila oh 

My friends and I meet hours before 
We make some home made pizza 
We do some funny bits back and forth 
My knees buckle I laugh so hard 

We might end three sheets to wind 
And who knows where we'll wind up 
All I know is there’s a car waiting 
And we’ll figure that out after 

I have to keep my eye on my old friend from high school 
We’ve known each other for the longest time 
She has trouble with her dance so to speak 
She can hoist a really good kick in the butt when she's excited 
She doesn’t do it so much anymore 
'Cuz we’re all on to her 

Bring on the Tequila oh 
On fire on Tequila oh 
Mostest most on Tequila oh 
Bestest friends on Tequila oh 

Then there’s my other pretty friend from high school 
The predator in me is put to shame by the predator in her 
and now i've reeled it in 
It’ll be interesting to see how much she’s done as well 

Then there’s my friend from Chigago 
God do I love all people from Chicago 
All ready to light up the barbeque 
And be harping on debauchery 

Bring on the Tequila oh 
On fire on Tequila oh 
Mostest most on Tequila oh 
Bestest friends on Tequila oh 

Then there’s my Canadian friend 
What a fabulous mom she’s become 
She’s been tortured in this sense 
for the last many of months for obvious reasons 

She was like "hey where was this part of you when I wasn’t pregnant" 
I laughed and did a shot in her honor 
As I conversed with her belly 

Bring on the Tequila oh 
On fire on Tequila oh 
Mostest most on Tequila oh 
Bestest friends on Tequila oh 

Then there’s my Cupid friend 
She sure knows how to dress that one 
She’s a wise and worldly girl 
But you gotta watch that medication 

My favorite beverage is taken to a whole other level on it 
I’m not worried about it or I’ll coast around the room 
While I trust she’ll temper 

My brother came to visit me 
And now he’s used to hanging with me and cracking up 
But he had no idea about my built up tolerance 
No idea about how manipulative I’ve become 
I would seruptitiously put it in front of him without him asking 
In a pretty little shot glass 
His smirk and cackle would only agg me on
