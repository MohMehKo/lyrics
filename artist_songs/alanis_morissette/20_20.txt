I would never have been in such a rush
I would never have tried to control
I would never have worn such 'fear lenses'
I would never have held on so tightly

I would have kept my boundaries set
My loving no’s, my unwavering yes’s
Risked abandonment and stood by that
And thereby felt constant connect

This fountain of regret, this looking back with twenty-twenty
Torturous hindsight if i knew then what i know now
This mountain of remorse won’t repeat with my understanding
This wouldn’t have happened if i knew then what i know now

I would’ve gone slower
Pushed infrequent
Would not have rushed into such commitment
I would’ve shown restraint as my feet got wet
I would’ve baby-stepped into intimate

This fountain of regret, this looking back with twenty-twenty
This torturous hindsight if i knew then what i know now
This mountain of remorse won’t repeat with my understanding
This wouldn’t have happened if i knew then what i know now

I would’ve known much more
Known that time was all we had for future depth to unfold
I would’ve had more faith at every step
I would’ve kept intact through the whole process

Oh this fountain of regret is looking back with twenty-twenty
Torturous hindsight if i knew then what i know now
This mountain of remorse won’t repeat with my understanding
This wouldn’t have happened if i knew then what i know
