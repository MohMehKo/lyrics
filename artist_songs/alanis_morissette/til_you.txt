I’ve been wasting time
Clawing my way to you
Taking no prisoners with my romantic crimes
I’ve been holding on imagining glimpses of you
Holding my breath while you come down the pike

Spinning my wheels around
I’m here, dodging bullets til you
Ear to the ground
While I'm dodging bullets til you

I’ve been taking notes
Nursing the thought of you
Research and deliver 'cause I’m biding my time
I’ve been holding on this magnet that calls to you
Entertaining myself with these consolation prizes

Spinning my wheels around
I’m here, dodging bullets til you
Ear to the ground
While I'm dodging bullets til you

They’ve been plenty fond
But mere placeholders for you
They fill this dance card
As you form in my mind

Spinning my wheels around
I’m here, dodging bullets til you
Ear to the ground
I’m here, dodging bullets til you

Til you
