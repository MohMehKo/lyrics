I wanna bite her cheek
And I wanna kiss your teeth
Make you feel so weird
I wanna be the one
To make this come undone
And make you feel uncomfortable
Well I am the King
Of very foolish things
Just you wait and see
Well I will freak you out
Make you scream and shout
Until it's time to go
Now that we're alone
There's no place like home
For me to let you down
Well I'm the kind of creep
Who'll leave you on the street
But not before I've hurt you
Well I will take your love
I'll chew and spit it out
I'm trying hard to hurt you
And I'll take your love
I'll chew and spit it out
I'm trying hard to hurt you
