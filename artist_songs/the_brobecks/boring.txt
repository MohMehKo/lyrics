Boring, everything is boring,
And every day is the same,
Every day is exactly the same.
Boring, all of us are bored,
Every day is exactly the same,
Exactly the same as before.
Oh what, oh what are you boring me for?

It's up to you, to find something to do,
It's useless and boring, don't wanna be bored anymore,
Oh what are you boring me for?

Nothing, nothing is as boring,
Boring as you, nothing is as boring as you.
Wasted, time is less effective,
Then growing less attractive to you,
There's nothing that's new anymore.
Oh what, oh what are you boring me for?

It's up to you, to find something to do,
It's useless and boring, don't wanna be bored anymore,
Oh what are you boring me for?

[Guitar Solo]

It's up to you, to find something to do,
It's useless and boring, don't wanna be bored anymore,
Oh what are you boring me for?
Oh-oh, anymore,
What are you boring me... for?
