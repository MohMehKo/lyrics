Bad reception everywhere I go
Misconceptions round my back door
Wanted to try you on
Wanted to try you out
Don't tell my mother, she might freak out

I was running through your drawers
Hoping you would not bust through that door

Sarah
Would it be alright 
If I came to you, came to you at night?
Keep it down real low
No one has to know
Could you shut those doors, while I try your clothes?

With my [?] by my side we're finally in
Seen all the merchandise, let us begin

The game is over now
I guess I'm done
Accusations
There's more than one
Did I creep you out?
Did I creep you in?
Please don't hate me now, it's who I am
Finally did it, but we're under arrest
I'm sorry friends but this was our guess
