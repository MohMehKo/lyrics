It doesn't take much,
To cover up small cuts,
Hid' 'neath the bandages,
Under her sleeve.

She just wants attention.
We all want attention.
She just wants it more than,
She'd have you believe.

Goodnight,
Sleep tight,
Don't let anyone bite you.
She will leave you deaf and bewildered.
Oh how she floats like a butterfly,
Stings like a killer.

All of the good kids,
Will darken their eyelids,
Cover in make-up,
And uncomfortable dress.

They just want attention.
We all want attention.
A beautiful kiss and a sin to confess.

Goodnight,
Sleep tight,
Don't let anyone bite you.
She will leave you deaf and bewildered,
Oh how she floats like a butterfly,
Stings like a killer.

It doesn't take much,
To cover up small cuts,
Hid' 'neath the bandages,
Under her sleeves.
Oh...
