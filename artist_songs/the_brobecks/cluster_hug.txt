I'm a teenage beauty queen of sorts 
Calculated, cold, without remorse. 

We can go to town 
We can mess around 
We can do anything 

Disseminate disease 
Doing anything that we please. 

Only if you like me too, 
I could fall in love with you 
Only if you'd like me to fall in love 

Darling, you're a holy quarantine 
Shake me like a tambourine 
We can mess around 
We can burn this town to ash 
As charming as we are, 
We are nothing but pretty trash. 

Only if... 

Ooh I love you so 
Never let me go 
Beautiful quarantine 
Circumvent me.
