I got your picture on my wall
You've got no hand because I tore it off
No more letters or phone calls, please
Just go away and let me sleep

Well I hate summertime because
It's the season that you cut me off
And take away those solar rays
Darker skies will make better days

Well I wanna buy a gun
And shoot the sun
Shoot the sun, sun

Well I wanna buy a gun
And shoot the sun
Shoot the sun

A nuclear winter sounds good to me
Well there's no light as far as I can see
I hope you're happy with what you've done
We live in a world where there's no more sun

Well I wanna buy a gun
And shoot the sun
Shoot the sun, sun

Well I wanna buy a gun
And shoot the sun
Shoot the sun [x3]
