Isn't it a fact
Your mother broke her back
Oh it breaks you up
Always breaking up

The mission not complete
'Cause you're still on your feet
Gonna get what's coming
You always get what's coming

Well all of you
And all of me too
She's a robot
She's a robot
She's a robot
She's a robot

Well this is just a test
Emergency broadcast
You can't turn the station
Can never turn the station

Well all of you
And all of me too
She's a robot
She's a robot
She's a robot
She's a robot
