In the darkest corner of the house
I found her body there
Cold and stiff
Spine in a twist
She left a note
It read like so
My Dearest one
Here's what you've done

I've got your knife inside my back
I've got your rope around my neck
I feel the poison in my veins
Corrode and eat away my brain
I've told you fifteen dozen times
And that's one hundred-eighty times
If I can't have you
Then no one can

She was an honest girl (never told a lie)
Raised with the finest things (far too rich to die)
A silver spoon
Gold diamond rings
And her sainted mother
The benefactor
Of the inheritance that I was after
She's got a feeling that I'll get even
And if I can't have you
Then no one can!
Whoah, Oh, Oh!

I've got your knife inside my back
I've got your rope around my neck
I feel the poison in my veins
Corrode and eat away my brain
I've told you fifteen dozen times
And thats one hundred-eighty times
If I can't have you
Then no one can
