Vampires never have to complain,
Of living a dull circumstance.
So let's all pretend that we are undead,
In turn of the century France.

I want the love on your wrist,
Oh, give me the heart on your neck.
And it would be fine,
To spend my whole life,
With you, together.
Parlez vous, or something like that.
Le velo pour deux or something like that,
And that's what I'll say to get you to ride away with me.

Oh!

Oh, it would be so fine to spend my whole life,
With you, on a bicycle built for two.

Ahhh, ahhh, whoah, oh, oh!
Ahhh, ahhh, whoah, oh, oh!
Oh it would be so oh fine to spend my whole life,
With you, on a bicycle built for two.
