It was a lie
How could I know?
A laughing stock all over town
Where do I stand if not for [?]
Oh

Call it a night
But don't go to bed
Think about how 
You'll have me instead
And being apart
The way it should be

I like you, you, you

[?] No one ever really thought it would come to this
But the street don't go to you anymore
And everybody's pushing the man downstairs, downstairs [?]

I'll sing this to you
But I don't got the words
I think I like you, do you like me too?
We'll call it a night
But don't go to bed
You'll think about how
You have me instead
And being a part
The way it should be

I like you, you, you

[?] No one ever really thought it would come to this
But the street don't go to you anymore
And everybody's pushing the man downstairs, downstairs [?]

I used to like you, but I don't now.

You never cared, you never cared
Monday morning
Monday morning
Monday morning
