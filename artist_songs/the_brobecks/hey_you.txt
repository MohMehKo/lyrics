Hey you
Why you've got to put us down?
Hey you
Well you've got to listen now

Hey there
No we don't care
For your style
Hey there
No we don't care to walk a mile

You don't want to mess with us
You don't want to mess with us
'Cause we're too tired and we don't care
'Cause we're too tired to go anywhere

And hey kids
They only want you if
You're a star
Hey kids
They only want you if
You get far

You don't want to mess with us
You don't want to mess with us
'Cause we're too tired and we don't care
'Cause we're too tired to go anywhere

Hey you
Why you've got to
Put us down
