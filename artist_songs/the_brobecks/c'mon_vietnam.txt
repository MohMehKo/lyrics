Goodmornin Vietnam how ya doing
it's me your favorite son janho
set up your empires in the snow, woah
c'mon vietnam lets go

your tracing bullets fly through December
you get cold fusion nuclear war
you know that i will miss the screams 
oh the screamin
that decorate your nights with laserbeams

Now the Vietcong and I
You know that we don't want to die
You get your crazy violent nights
and help us know, oh

Though you may not know our name
But we love you still the same
c'mon c'mon vietnam lets go
