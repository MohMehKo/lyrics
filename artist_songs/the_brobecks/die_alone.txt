Can I die away from you?
What you do, it isn't ordinary too.
There's nothing to do, but lie.
I guess I'll die, guess I'll die
alone-ly guy

What you got is what I need.
No sympathy will you ever get from me.

There's nothing to do, but lie.
I guess I'll die, guess I'll die
alone-ly guy

Guess I'll die alone
Guess I'll die a lonely
Guess I'll die a lonely guy.

Can I die away from you?
Watch what you do,
it isn't ordinary too.
Oh, three.

There's nothing to do, but lie.
I guess I'll die, guess I'll die
alone-ly guy.

Guess I'll die alone
Guess I'll die a lonely
Guess I'll die a lonely guy.
One more time.
Guess I'll die alone.
I guess I'll die a lonely.
Guess I'll die a lonely guy.

I've just but one request:
That I'll soon get my rest and die...
a lonely
guy.
