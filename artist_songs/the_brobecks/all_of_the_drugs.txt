All of the drugs, she takes at night,
Keep her awake, Give me a fright,
I don't know what goes through her mind,
When she takes drugs.

All of the lies she tells herself,
Won't be believed by anybody else.
And I can't buy just what she sells,
When she tells lies.

And she takes her pills, And she tells her lies,
And she breaks my heart, and breaks her word,
But I still act sur-, surprised.

Every kiss she gives away, might be a good time,
But you know, the sad thing is the boys all say,
She's something of a slut.

And she takes her pills, and she tells her lies,
And she breaks my heart, and breaks her word,
But I still act surprised.
