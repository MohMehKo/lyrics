I really don't know why I'm writing this letter
I just think it must be easier than talking about it
You know, whenever I say to myself, 'What if this doesn't work out?'
The first person I think of is you
I just hope you never think I only had you around just to pass the time
Please don't think that.

It's, it's hard to stay focused when I'm with you all the time
And when I'm not, I'm thinking about you
I can't get close to people very easily, unless I know it's worth it
I felt close to you instantly
I've only done that with one other person

I wish you all the happiness in the world.
