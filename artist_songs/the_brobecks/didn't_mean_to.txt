I didn't mean to creep you out
But sometimes it's alright to scream and shout it out

I wanna meet your mom and dad (cause I do)
I'm sorry if that makes you a little bit upset
I didn't mean to creep you out
But sure it makes me scream and shout
And it knocks me out, knocks me out, knocks me out I know
Oh, I know

I didn't mean to creep you out
Sure it makes me scream and shout
It knocks me out, knocks me out, knocks me out I know
Oh, I know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
