The girl might think 
she's got a trick up her sleeve 
The truth of it is, 
she's getting hard to believe. 

I don't want to wake up 
I just want to stay at home 
break the skin and bone 
It's so much better 
when I'm alone 

An eloquent posture 
for someone so obviously stupid 
with shelves upon shelves of old books 
but you never read them 

I don't want to wake up.. 

I know that we can not stay home 
Its getting late, 
don't give me that tone. 
Don't answer when I ask you: 
Please, can I just stay inside? 

I don't want to wake up 
I just want to stay at home 
to break the skin and bone 
its so much better when I'm alone. 
from anyone I know.
