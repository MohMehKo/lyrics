Before we save the future
We gotta bring the past
Like Bill and Ted's adventure,
It was excellent at best
And everyone who was there
Was really happy that they passed 

Whoa.

I know I'm not your kind of guy,
But please don't just reject me.
I've never gotten drunk,
But I'd be a punk if my mom would let me
And everyone except for you knows
That we'd be really good

Whoa, yeah.

I'd be a punk if my mom would let me
I'd be a punk if my mom would let me
I'd be a punk if my mom would let me
I'd be a punk if my mom would let me

It's all true.
