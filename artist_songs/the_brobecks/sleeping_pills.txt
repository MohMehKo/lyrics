Make a wish and pray it sticks,
So I can shut my eyes.
'cause it feels like weeks since I last slept,
So please turn out the light.

Lets shoot the sun, 
So every one can return to their beds.
'cause with no light the day is night,
And we can rest our heads.

If time exists then I want it to,
Be back on my side.
So hours will mean somethin' to me,
And I can feel alright.

Sleeping pills and late night films are eatin' me alive.
Sleeping pills and late night films are eatin' me alive.
Sleeping pills and late night films are eatin' me alive.
Sleeping pills and late night films are eatin' me alive.

Well if by chance you catch me sleeping,
Please don't wake me,
'cause I'll be dreaming.

The Sleeping pills and late night films are eatin' me alive.
Sleeping pills and late night films are eatin' me alive.
Sleeping pills and late night films are eatin' me alive.
Sleeping pills and late night films are eatin' me alive.
Sleeping pills and late night films are eatin' me alive.
Sleeping pills and late night films are eatin' me alive.
