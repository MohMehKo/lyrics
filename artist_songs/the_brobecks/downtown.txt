Pretty girls in cars
With the boys in bars
Thank your lucky stars
They didn't give you scars

I've seen one street
Sexy people meet
Can you feel the heat
You best get off this beat

Same old scene
Going down
Let me take you downtown
Would you still stick around?
Let me take you downtown

I'll show you what it's all about around here

Well don't look at me
You know it ain't my scene
You're such a pretty thing
With all your magazines
Come on

Same old scene
Going down
Let me take you downtown
Would you still stick around?
Let me take you downtown
I know who you are
