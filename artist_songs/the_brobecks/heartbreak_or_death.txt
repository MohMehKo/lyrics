Me and you are meant to be,
Like stars in the sky,
And leaves on the trees.
When times are tough,
I want you to think,
Of you in my arms,
Me kissing your cheek.

They say all good things have an end,
So will it be heartbreak or death?
Maybe we can last beyond all time,
My hand in yours,
And your hand in mine.
