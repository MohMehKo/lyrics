Well you used to have a pretty face,
And it used to be so common place,
That I’d always get what I want,
And you’d always get what you want.

And I don’t like you anymore,
And I don’t like you anymore.
Well why not?
Well why not?

Oh don’t you think its swell,
Oh you look so fancy but I can tell,
You’re not getting on with your life.
You’re not getting on with your life.

And I don’t like you anymore,
And I don’t like you anymore,
So just cut yourself with a knife,
Just cut yourself with a knife.

If you don’t love me anymore,
I think I’ll kill myself,
Because I’m sure as sure can be
There is nobody else.
For you,
But me.

If you don’t love me anymore,
I think I’ll kill myself,
Because I’m sure as sure can be
There is nobody else.
For you,
But me.

Well you used to have a pretty face,
And it used to be so common place,
That I’d always get what I want,
And you’d always get what you want.
