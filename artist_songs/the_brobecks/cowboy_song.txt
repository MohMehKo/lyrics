I hide behind these clothes
No one knows at all
I hide behind these clothes
No one knows at all

I hide behind my girlfriend
She's fly, she's fly
I hide behind my girlfriend
She's fly, she's fly

But it used to be okay but it's getting worse
It used to be okay but it's getting worse
It used to be okay

I'm tired of this scene
All the ladies and all the honeys
I'm tired of this scene
All the ladies and all the honeys

That I'm a cowboy
I'm a cowboy
I'm a cowboy now

It used to be okay but it's getting worse
It used to be okay but it's getting worse
It used to be okay

I hide behind these clothes
No one knows at all
I hide behind these clothes
No one knows at all

That I'm a cowboy
I'm a cowboy
I'm a cowboy now
I'm a cowboy now
