Stay up real late
Let's go to the place
Well don't tell your Dad
He wouldn't understand

Hang on one more year
Soon I'll be here
Well don't take the chance
You can't come back

Don't go to waste
'Cause good girls always wait
But not

Now that it's gone
I hope you prove me wrong
I hope you get what you deserve
All the things I've never heard

Don't go to waste
'Cause good girls always wait
But not

Don't go to waste
'Cause good girls always wait
But not for me
