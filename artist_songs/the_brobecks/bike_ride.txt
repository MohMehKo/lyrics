Hey kids, hey kids, can you rock and roll?
Tell me (Yeah!, Yeah!),
Alright, let's go!

Constantly doing things that you don't like,
Riding bikes across the street,
Without lookin' either way, yeah, yeah.

Well I'm in hell, I've got to tell somebody now,
Well I'm in hell, I've got to tell somebody now,
Well I'm in hell, I've got to tell somebody now,
I'm in hell n' I've got to tell somebody now.

Bah-bah-bah, Bah-bah-bah,
Bah-bah-bah, Bah-bah-bah.

Chasing these pretty, pretty things,
That talk too much, but I don't mind,
Riding bikes across the street,
Without lookin' either way, (either way) either way.

Oh I'm in hell, I've got to tell somebody now,
Well I know you can't hear me too well the TV is up too loud,
Oh I'm in hell, I've got to tell somebody now,
I'm in hell, n' I've got to tell somebody now.
Oh, oh right, c'mon!

Well I'm in hell, I've got to tell somebody now,
I know you can't hear me too well the TV is up too loud,
Oh I'm in hell, I've got to tell somebody now,
I'm in hell, and I've got to tell somebody now.
Bah-bah-bah...
