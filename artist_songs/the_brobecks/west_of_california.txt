Too much talk makes my ears burn,
Watch me as my eyes turn,
Inside my head.
It's hard when you lose a lover,
And you lose a best friend,
In the same day.

I guess it's just a matter of time,
Before my life, will come to an end.
And it's got me confused,
About some things,
Some things called, 'You'.

I'll make a home inside of the ocean,
West of California, where it's warm.
You can visit me if you want to,
If you think it suits you, under there.

I guess it's just a matter of time,
Before my life, will come to an end.
And it's got me confused,
About some things,
Some things called, 'You'.

Love is hard to find,
If you don't realize that it's love.
Love is hard to find,
If you don't realize that it could be the end.

I guess it's just a matter of time,
Before my life, will come to an end.
And it's got me confused,
Abut some things,
Some things called, 'You'.

Too much talk makes my ears burn,
Watch as my eyes turn,
Inside my head.
