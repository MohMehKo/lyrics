Shining like the sun,
The distance makes her tough.
Well I am just a kid,
And he's a journalist.

It's inside of me,
Oh Jacqui, can't you see?
You can't make it harder than it is.

Well it's a lovely day,
For you to come this way.
We could fill the hole,
They put in rock and roll.

Do you feel the same?
Like needles in your brain.
You can't make it harder than it is.
It is.
Alright.

Well it's inside of me,
Oh Jacqui, can't you see?
You can't make it,
No you can't make it,
No you can't make it,
Harder than it is.
