Down the road,
About a mile or so,
My baby shuts her eyes.
Well I send words to her constantly,
And she quickly replies.

The city lights are big and bright,
But I think I'll stay right here.
Well I'll be fine if they take my life,
But it's losing you I fear.

They can take anything from me,
But they can't take you!
And I can't go from my home,
Because my home is where I want to be!

If we can fight our tired eyes tonight,
We could watch the sun come up.
The perfect way to start a perfect day,
The sun, your house, and us.

Well they can take anything from me,
But they can't take you!
And I can't go from my home,
Because my home is where I want to be!

They can take anything from me,
But they can't take you.
And I can't go from my home,
Because my home is where I want to be!

Well they can take anything, anything, anything, anything,
From me, but they can't take you!
