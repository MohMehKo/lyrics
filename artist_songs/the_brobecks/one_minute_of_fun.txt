Welcome to the Nuclear Sunshine Research family.
Our facilities stand on 18 acres of lush, artificial grass and plant life.
We pride ourselves on our respect for our surroundings and have several environmental awareness classes available, should you feel the need to pitch in.

As you walk through our campus you'll see several smoke stacks.
Don't worry, those gases won't hurt you (we don't think!)

Our waste management area is located near the East Wing.
Its filtering system allows yesterday's waste to become today's drinking water.
Drink up, Timmy!

If you've ever wondered "What does radiation do?" the only way we can answer this, of course, by letting you breathe in the toxic chemicals we call energy.

We think you'll find it refreshing, and you'll learn to make nuclear discharge a part of your everyday life.

The future is now.
