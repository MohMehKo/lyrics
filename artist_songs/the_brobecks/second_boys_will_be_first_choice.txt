Gather 'round ye boys and girls, listen ye to my tale,
Of two boys and one girl, but which one will win her?
And which one is destined to fail?

Complicated situation made harder every day,
Boy number two there is someone for you,
Just forget her and walk away.

Don't be fooled! Be careful which one that you choose,
Second boys will be first choice to somebody better than you.

Don't be fooled! Be careful which one that you choose,
Second boys will be first choice to somebody better than you.

Oh!

[Guitar Solo]

Don't be fooled! Be careful which one that you choose,
Second boys will be first choice to somebody better than you.
