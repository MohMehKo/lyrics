Everybody knows and I've said it before,
She takes off her clothes,
Shakes me like I'm not shaken before.

Oh my girl, oh my girl, just give me a chance,
I don't want to explain, I just want to dance,
On the graves, on the graves, of every girl,
That I knew before you, that are dead to me too.
Hey.

Try to shut your eyes, and this won't hurt one bit.
See I cannot tell a lie, you just might even like me to quit.

Oh my girl, oh my girl, just give a chance,
I don't want to explain, I just want to dance,
On the graves, on the graves, of every girl,
That I knew before you, that are dead to me too.

You always get everything that you want,
I can't explain, so I'll flaunt what you got.
I'm yours and you're mine, if you like it or not.
Oh-ho, oh-ho, I know, oh-ho hey!

Oh my girl, oh my girl, just give me a chance,
I don't want to explain, I just want to dance,
On the graves, on the graves, of every girl,
That I knew before you, that are dead to me too.

You always get everything that you want,
I can't explain so I'll flaunt what you got.
But I'm yours and you're mine, if you like it or not.
Uh-oh, oh no! Oooh, it's so good! Oh-ho, Uh-oh, n' wha-ho! Oh!
