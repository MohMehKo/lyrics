Take some time and free it up
Take some time but you don't give up
Yeah

Called your name in a dream
Called your name inside of me
It don't hurt at all
It don't hurt at all

Take a walk down the street
Brand new shoes on your feet
Yeah

All I've got is me
And all you've got is free
Too bad it won't last
Too bad it won't last
