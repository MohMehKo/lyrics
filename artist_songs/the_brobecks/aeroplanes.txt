Aeroplanes in the sky
Bring you back to me.
You will learn by and by
That you were meant for me.

You have changed,
So have I,
It's not hard to see.
But I swear,
That I won't lie.
That must mean something.

55 days have passed
Since I last saw your face.
And how long will this last?
How much more will it take for you to see?
I need you here.

Aeroplanes in the sky
Bring her back to me.

LAX to your home,
Something went very wrong,
And I heard the pilot screaming,
And then your girl hold me close
Told me that she loves you most.

Aeroplanes in the sky
Bring her back to me.

Aeroplanes in the sky
Bring her back to me.
