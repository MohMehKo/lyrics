Look at me wrong,
It could be your last mistake.
And don't break my heart,
It could be your arm I break.

And this could be the last time,
That we're gonna fall in love.
Oh it could be the last time,
Of making it up.
Oh.

The kiss in the night,
A night out on the town.
It makes me feel bad,
At least 'till I turned around.

And this could be the last time,
That we're gonna fall in love.
Oh it could be the last time,
Of making it up.
Oh! C'mon!

Well I don't need surgery tonight,
Oh, oh, no I don't need surgery, yeah, tonight.
Baby, oh tonight.

Oh look at me wrong,
And it could be your last mistake.
D-d-d-don't break my heart,
It could be your last arm I break.

And this could be the last time,
That we're gonna fall in love.
Oh it could be the last time,
Of making it up.
Oh yeah!
Oh it could be the last time of making it up.
Oh! C'mon now!

Oh it could be (it could be),
The last time (the last time),
It could be (it could be),
The last time,
We're gonna fall in love...
