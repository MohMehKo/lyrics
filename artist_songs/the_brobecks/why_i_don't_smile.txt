Why don't you smile?
My teeth would get cold
And you know that
It's not that I'm sad
It's not that I'm down

Why don't you smile?
I just don't want you to care
It's really no big deal
That I don't smile
But I still think that you're swell

Why don't you smile?
My teeth would get cold
And you know that
You know that it's not that I'm sad
And it's not that I'm down, no, no

Why don't you smile?
I just don't want you to care
It's really no big deal
That I don't smile
But I still think that you're swell

And Erika's decked out and down on the floor
She's thinking of someone she's thought of before
And it sure ain't me
that crosses her mind
and that's why I don't smile most of the time
And oh, oh

You just turn it on like a switch.
Turn it off.
