Well honey I must confess, 
You're a mess, I think it's funny 
It's immature at best 
But I do my best to be the good guy

I didn't mean to cause a pain in your brain
I'm really sorry
I know that that it hurts 
And I'm a jerk, its just my way

Sorry everyone that I've done
public displays of affection
everything that I do
turns a knife inside of you

Well I can move my arms but my head is gone [x2]

Honey I must confess you're a mess
I think it's funny
