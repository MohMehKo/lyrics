You come in waves
Till you're all I know
Then you fade away
Into nothing
Weighed down by dark matter inside
You leave me frozen
You leave me froze in time
In your

Everglow
You'll never know
The beauty I see when you open your shadows
Everglow
They'll never know
The worlds that I see in the darkness you don't show

Falling through a landslide
Feeling like the first time I felt you
Caught inside the field lines
That pull me to the land mines inside you
Black hole eyes won't gaze now
Drawn in just the same
You leave me frozen
You leave me frozen inside

Everglow
You'll never know
The beauty I see when you open your shadows
Everglow
They'll never know
The worlds that I see in the darkness you don't show
[x2]

Come
I'll show every ghost in me
Take my pain into you...
