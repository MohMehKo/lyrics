I was scanning through the skies
And missed the static in your eyes
Something bugging your reception
It's distorting our connection
With the distance amplified
Was it all just synthesized?
And now the silence screams that you are gone
You've tuned me out
I've lost your frequency

There's something here thatâ€™s broken
There's something here with no end
It's paralyzed
It's in your eyes
Cause I can feel your soul fade
I can feel your heart change
It falls out of phase with mine
While you oscillate inside
Or is it only in my head?

I was scanning through the skies
And missed the static in your eyes
Something bugging your reception
It's distorting our connection
With the distance amplified
Was it all just synthesized?
And now the silence screams that you are gone
You've tuned me out
I've lost your frequency

Left inside a half-life
Irradiated insides
These memories
They never leave
I bared my soul for you and all I got was static
My heart was bulletproof till you took off the jacket

I was scanning through the skies
And missed the static in your eyes
Something bugging your reception
It's distorting our connection
With the distance amplified
Was it all just synthesized?
And now the silence screams that you are gone
You've tuned me out
I've lost your frequency

Lost your frequency

Castaway
My cries are blocked by the horizon
Suffocate
I was doing this all for you

I'm in the shallows
Stuck in the gallows
I tried to save you now I'm swallowed
You wanted war
I am the war
I alone

Something bugging your reception
It's distorting our connection
With the distance amplified
Was it all just synthesized?
And now the silence screams that you are gone
You've tuned me out
I've lost your frequency
