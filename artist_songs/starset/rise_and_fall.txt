Watch them all lie down
Watch the eyeless gain control,
Gain control!
They could never blind me

I clench the fist and overtake it all
I navigate the endless rise and fall
You push my back against the wall
When I attack I'm taking all
I'm taking it all
Rise and fall

One more fits inside the mold
One last chance to break the hold,
Break the hold!

I clench the fist and overtake it all
I navigate the endless rise and fall
You push my back against the wall
When I attack I'm taking all
Taking it all
Rise and fall!
Rise and fall!

I clench the fist and overtake it all
I navigate the endless rise and fall
You push my back against the wall
When I attack I'm taking all
I'm taking it all
Rise and fall
