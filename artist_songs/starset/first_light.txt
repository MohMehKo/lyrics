Cascading waves of change
The future
Events we think to be inconsequential,
Can affect the future unintentionally

What if you had the power to affect monumental change.
Would you let fear consume or would you overcome?

We sent a message into the past, a warning
We have that message
Though this story is not inevitable,
And a society does evolve.
We can change our fate,
We can change the future,
We can change the past.
