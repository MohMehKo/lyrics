They said there was no way
But they forgot the black hole in the sky
Yesterday is nothing
I have half a life to rewrite
Flying into this future
I will let the science bring the change
This will be the final cure
I am gonna take the past away

[Chorus:]
With the full force
Of a dying star
I will find you
If you’re near or far
Wherever you are

Floating through forever
I am stealing the energy
Endlessly endeavor
This is finding infinity
I’m falling through a dark sunrise
I will escape the entropy
And find a way to leave this time
I will bring you back to me

[Chorus:]
With the full force
Of a dying star
I will find you
If you’re near or far
Wherever you are

Wherever you are!
