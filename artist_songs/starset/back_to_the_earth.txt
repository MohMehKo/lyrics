And the world
Pull me high, far above, wicked skies
Set me free
Set alive
I become, satellite

Isolated, I succumb to the weight of the world
Separated, I fall from the sky

Is this death or rebirth?

Falling back to the earth

(Falling, falling)
(Falling, falling)
(Falling, falling)
(Falling)

I ignite, engine call
Jettison, all I know

Isolated, I succumb to the weight of the world
Separated, I fall from the sky

Is this death or rebirth?

Falling back to the earth

(Falling, falling)
(Falling, falling)
(Falling, falling)
(Falling, falling)
(Falling, falling)
(Falling, falling)
(Falling, falling)
(Falling, falling)
(Falling, falling)
(Falling, falling)
(Falling, falling)
(Falling, falling)
(Falling, falling)
(Falling, falling)
(Falling, falling)
(Falling, falling)

(Fall)
(Fall)
(Fall)
(Fall)
