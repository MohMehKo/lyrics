There's a silencing
As the machine arrives here
I feel it pulling me
I feel the past that's died there
I hear it calling me
"You can come alive here."
I hear it beckoning
Until I am inside

Riding the horizon
Falling into you
Feel the vessel tighten
I feel you pull me through
A new world is breaking
Your heart is unveiling
Breaking into pieces
In the gravity of you

I see the empty dreams
Race across the sky here
I see energy streams
Where the ashes lie here
I feel you here with me
When all the hope has died here
It's boring holes in me
Enough to get inside

Riding the horizon
Falling into you
Feel the vessel tighten
I feel you pull me through
A new world is breaking
Your heart is unveiling
Breaking into pieces
In the gravity of you

To fall in the star is to be nothingness
To escape is to be empty
Fall into the star and then we won't exist
Or escape into the nothing
[x2]

Your sky
The beauty alone is worth it
I will risk it all to own it

Riding the horizon
Falling into you
Feel the vessel tighten
I feel you pull me through
A new world is breaking
Your heart is unveiling
Breaking into pieces
In the gravity of you
