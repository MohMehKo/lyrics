You’re out there
I hear you calling from behind the star fields
I feel you
Radiating energy like eternal northern lights

Far from the sun
Where no one knows
I’ve watched you from
My telescope

I will travel the distance in your eyes
Interstellar light years from you
Supernova: we’ll fuse when we collide
Awaking in the light of all the stars aligned

I see you
Washing over me across the sky
Overcoming
Projected on my eyes eternally
I find you in the night

Far from the sun
Where no one knows
I’ve watched you from
My telescope

I will travel the distance in your eyes
Interstellar light years from you
Supernova: we’ll fuse when we collide
Awaking in the light of all the stars aligned

I will find you…

I will travel the distance in your eyes
Interstellar light years from you
Supernova: we’ll fuse when we collide
Awaking in the light of all the stars aligned
