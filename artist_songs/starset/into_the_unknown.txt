Dislocated
Self is fading
Falling back from what I was
Flying through existence
Tumbling towards a burning sun
Something screaming in the distance
Telling me to come
It's calling me

Are you out there waiting?
I can hear it calling
It takes more than eyes to see
It's out in the energy but
I can hear it calling

Take the path less traveled
Face the darkness on my own
Into the starlight will I go
Until the end I will roam
Fate itself unraveled
Make the emptiness my home
Into the starlight will I go
Soaring into the unknown

Suffocated
Voice has faded
Is this real or in my mind?

I can hear it calling
It takes more than eyes to see
It's out in the energy but
I can hear it calling

Take the path less traveled
Face the darkness on my own
Into the starlight will I go
Until the end I will roam
Fate itself unraveled
Make the emptiness my home
Into the starlight will I go
Soaring into the unknown
