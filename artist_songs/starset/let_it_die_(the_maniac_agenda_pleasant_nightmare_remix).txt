Let it die

Let it die

Let it die

I've been looking for a way
To bring you back to life
And if I could find a way,
Then I would bring you back tonight
I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

I've been looking for a way to life
I've been looking for a way to life

I've been looking for a way to life
Let it die

I've been looking for a way to life
Let it die

Your eyes stare right through me
Ignoring my failed attempts to
Breathe back life into your veins
But all my threads couldn't stop the bleeding
There's nothing left, but I'm not leaving
When all I know is you

I've been looking for a way
To bring you back to life
And if I could find a way,
I would bring you back tonight
I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

But I can't start your cold heart beating
You're so far gone, but I'm not leaving
When all I know is you

I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

Let it die

Let it die

Let it die

Let it die
