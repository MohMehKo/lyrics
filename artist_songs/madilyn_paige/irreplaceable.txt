Can you see me over here?
Should I just disappear?
I tried to fit in next to you
Guess I wasn't clear
Or maybe I'm just not good enough

Feel so alone here
Can't even be myself
Tryna fit in
Left all I am on the shelf
Do I belong here,
Or should I just stop trying
To be some other girl?

When I find I'm all alone
Gotta tell myself
I'm irreplaceable
Bend it back
Quit tryna be someone else
I tell myself
I'm irreplaceable

Oh, oh, oh

Somehow I find a way
It's never easy
Why is it so hard?
All I've ever wanted
Is to be like them
I don't understand
Why I am who I am

When I find I'm all alone
Gotta tell myself
I'm irreplaceable
Bend it back
Quit tryna be someone else
Still myself
I'm irreplaceable

Oh, oh, oh

I've got to keep my head up
Be the girl I'm meant to be
I may not be like them but
That's okay, I can only be me!

When I find I'm all alone
Gotta tell myself
I'm irreplaceable
Bend it back
Quit tryna be someone else
I tell myself
I'm irreplaceable
