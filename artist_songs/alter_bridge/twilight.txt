The world has gone mad, the future is so unclear
Where do we stand? It feels like the end is near
I remember everything you said and what would come to be
A prophet of the future, now the future is reality

Twilight
Where do we go? Time is running out
We can't fight
Hope for a future worth saving now

One thing's for sure, we must accept and change
Or we in time will just have ourselves to blame
Divided by differences, now everything is torn apart
Tomorrow is contingent on the tolerance of every heart

Twilight
Where do we go? Time is running out
We can't fight
Hope for a future worth saving now

Will you show us the way we should go?

I looked at the sky, praying for time
Hoping for what hasn't come
The dream's still alive but the nightmare just won't come undone

The tyrants will rage, there's no time to waste
There's no telling what will become
If we don't sustain some hope from tomorrow, we'll learn

Twilight
Where do we go? Time is running out
We can't fight
Hope for a future worth saving now

Twilight
Where will we go when it all comes down?
We can't fight
Hope for a future worth saving now

Will you show us the way we should go?
