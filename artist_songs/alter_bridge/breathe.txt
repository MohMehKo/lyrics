You were hungry for life
Then you took mine
Left me so hollow
And I was eager to play
To give you all of me
For what I will never know

Well I'll rest my eyes
And I'll let the earth breathe
And I'll bide my time
I'll let the earth breathe

You wiped the smile from our face
Our saving grace
Our lasting passion
And with a knife in our soul
We will arise
We will not feel it

Well I'll rest my eyes
And I'll let the earth breathe
And I'll bide my time
I'll let the earth breathe

Well it's all I am
And it makes me feel at home
And I must be mad
And I must not care at all

Well I wipe my eyes
And I feel it taking warmth
'Cause it left me here
And it left me all alone

Well I'll rest my eyes
I'll let the earth breathe
And I'll bide my time
I'll let the earth breathe

Well I'll rest my eyes
I'll let the earth breathe
And I'll bide my time
I'll let the earth breathe
