Am I lost to wander forever
Perhaps for the rest of my days?
If all that has been surrendered will just go to waste

You left me out in the distance
To wander this world on my own
Sometimes it’s so hard to admit it but I can’t let go
I can’t let you go

[Chorus:]
Go on and take it all, go on and take it all
Fortress coming down
I know we can’t save it all, I know we can’t save it all
Everything is gone
Oh I have seen it all, oh I have seen it all
Fortress coming down
Go on and take it all, go on and take it all

One thing I know is for certain
We cannot have all we want
Still this will not stop the hurting. It is never gone

Now I hold on to the one thing
Too fragile to stand on its own
The fortress we built–it is crumbling. Still I can’t let go
I can’t let you go

[Chorus]

Fortress coming down

There’ll come a time, yes I know
There’ll come a time
You’ll look back and regret when it’s gone
You’ll look back and regret when it’s gone
There’ll come a time yes I know
There’ll come a time
You'll look back and regret when it’s gone
You’ll look back and regret when it’s gone

[Solo]

In the end, too far gone, this I can’t deny
Still I keep holding on.
You know there’s still time

On the outside looking in everything seems fine
But the fortress caving in.
Comes down on me tonight

[Chorus]

Just take it all
Just take it all
Just take it all
