What was sacred lost forevermore
Once your hatred washed up to the shore
Underneath I still can feel the pain
What you took can never be replaced

Stoned
Face
Liar

Your
Hate
Vile

[Chorus:]
For the blood you waste this will fall on you
Now your fate has been decided
For the life you take this is overdue
You are now the uninvited

Sirens screaming blood against the wall
No more saving innocence at all

No
Shame
Spineless

Cold
Rage
Violence

[Chorus]

Soon you'll feel it
All my agony
Soon you know it
All you fear will come to life
And it won't be long
For tonight
You are gonna know my pain

[Chorus]

For the blood you waste this will fall on you
You are now the uninvited

Stoned
Face
Liar

Stoned
Face
Liar
