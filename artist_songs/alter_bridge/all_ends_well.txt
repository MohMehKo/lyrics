If I could ease your mind, calm the storm inside
Pull your drifting heart back from a cruel and bitter tide
Show you that tomorrow everything will be just fine
All in due time

Somewhere down the road your stars will show
Somewhere down the road you're almost home
You're almost home

[Chorus:]
If you believe in nothing else
Just keep believing in yourself
There will be times of trouble,
It's gonna hurt like hell
This much I know, all ends well
It all ends well

If I could heal the scars
Show you what you are
Bind the wounds of disbelief
That brought you down so hard
I would be the tourniquet around your doubting heart
All in due time.

Somewhere down the road your stars will show
Somewhere down the road you're almost home
You're almost home

[Chorus]

It's so hard to see, It's so hard to find
All that you need will come in time
These words of wisdom, do not ignore
You have so much to give, once you live 
Once you live a little more

[Chorus]
This much I know, all ends well
