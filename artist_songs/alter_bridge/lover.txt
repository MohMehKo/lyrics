If you deny the wounds of your lover you will discover
That what you had is shattered and wasted
Did you have to take it so far?

The truth exposed and love is devoured
And the ivory tower is coming down
A vow betrayed and honor is broken
The wounds are open and bleeding out

But it's all I can do to carry on
It brings all I fear to life

[Chorus:]
If you deny the wounds of your lover you will discover
That what you had is shattered and wasted
Did you have to take it so far?

[x2]
Did you have to throw it all away?
Did you have to shove it in my face?
Did you have to tear my world apart?
Did you have to take so selfishly?
No matter how you hurt the ones you need?
Did you have to fall so very far?

The trigger's warm, the chamber is loaded
Lost in a moment. What went wrong?
There's nothing left this house has been broken
But still I'm holding, I'm holding on

[Chorus x2]

You can see it in your love
The wounds are open and I'm bleeding out
It's so real

[In The Background, repeating]
Now that you've come so far
Can you live with what you've done
And who you are?

[Chorus]
