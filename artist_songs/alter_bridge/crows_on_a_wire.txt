If you wanna step into the light
Well, I'm warning you, be wise
Nothing goes unnoticed
If you wanna lead or be a star
They'll expose all that you are
Are you sure you want this now?
They will only tear you down

'Cause they're waiting just like crows on a wire
They pry and conspire, that's all they do
Baiting to consume and devour
The glory and power they gave to you

If you wanna step into the ring
Well, you can't hide a god damn thing
In the end they'll find it
If you've got a secret deep inside
Nothing's sacred or divine
They will always bleed you out
They will always bleed you out

'Cause they're waiting just like crows on a wire
They pry and conspire, that's all they do
Baiting to consume and devour
The glory and power they gave to you

There will come a time
When all they give they will steal
The love you think you will find
Know that none of it's real

Waiting just like crows on a wire
They pry and conspire, that's all they do
Baiting to consume and devour
The glory and power they gave to you

Let this serve you as a reminder
No, they'll never tire, they'll come for you
Cause yes, they're baiting to consume and devour
The glory and power, so sad but true

You know it's true
You know it's true
You know it's true
