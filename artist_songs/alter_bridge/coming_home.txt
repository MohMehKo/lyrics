As I peel away
All the years of pain
I discovered what's been all along
You were so right
I was so wrong

Every shooting star
They all fall so hard
They all fade like a played out song
Now is the time
Before all is lost

I'm coming home
I'm coming home

[Chorus]
So I'm coming home
Lost on a road I don't belong
I'll rest my song
I'm so alone
Far from the streets I call my own
I'm coming home

Rushing back to me
As the city sleeps
So afraid of what I will find

Memories they haunt
From deep inside

Every broken man
Comes to understand
that he'll never find paradise
When all that he wants
Was there all the time

I'm coming home
I'm coming home

[Chorus]
So I'm coming home
Lost on a road I don't belong
I'll rest my song
I'm so alone
Far from the streets I call my own

So I'm coming home
Back to a world left long ago
And now I know
I'm coming home
I'll find my way back
I'm letting go
I'm coming home

We come to find
What we take for granted
Keeps us alive in the end

So don't let time
Leave you empty handed
Reach out tonight and make amends

[Chorus]
So I'm coming home
Back to the place where I belong
I'll rest my song
I'm so alone
Far from the streets I call my own

So I'm coming home
Back to a world left long ago
Now I know
I'm coming home
I'll find my way back
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
