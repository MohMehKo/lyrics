Ahhhhh...
I have played the part
I have all but lost my soul
And I have sacrificed for what it’s worth I just don’t know
In the silence of my heart
There is a distant call
Yeah...
It beckons me to stand apart.

So I set out on my own
Just to breath again
Touch the light that calls me home
Just to reach the end
Where I'm free to breathe again

Ohhh...
Through the suffering through the misery and pain
Never anything but the will to see the day
Yeahh...
When the promise might be born
Light the spark within
Yeahh...
Cause I can’t take it anymore.

So I set out on my own
Just to breath again
Touch the light that calls me home
Just to reach the end
Well I’m free to breathe again.

Well I am free to roam
And set out on my own
To rise above the hands that try to hold me down
Before the end
I know I’ll breathe again to find my way

So I set out on my own
Just to breath again
Touch the light that calls me home
Just to reach the end
I’m leaving today... [x3]
