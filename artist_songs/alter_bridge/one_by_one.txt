Underneath the desert sun
They bid my brother's blood to run
Many miles away
Hell has come today

Fire raining from the sky
See the face of fear asking one last time
Let me get home safe
Before it's too late

[Chorus:]
One by one
The brave will fall
Life is lost again
They gave it all

Deep within the castle walls
So many grieve as funeral songs
Echo endlessly
Ode to memories

This sacrifice of flesh and blood
For a promised land that may not be won
Let us not forget the hero laid to rest

[Chorus]

And they gave it all
A price we can't ignore
Is there hope in what they're dying for?
Fore every hero born
From every family torn
We will honor you forevermore

[Chorus 2x]
