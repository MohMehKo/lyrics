Turn off the lights
Just close your eyes and tell me what you see
I bet it doesn't have a goddamn thing to do with me
There's nothing left to say
I finally know the truth about you

You covered all, you played it well, I was the last to know
My premonition was the only thing that let it show
I gave you everything
But I could never pacify you

[Chorus:]
So go on and cry me a river
Don't say this will haunt you forever
It never did it never will

Tear it away, I wanna see just what you really are
And rip the veil that hides that wretched stone you call a heart
This is my agony
But I'll be damned to stay beside you

[Chorus]

Vows are not meant to be broken
You never cared for a moment
You never did you never will

Now I know the truth about you
All you need I will deny you
I'll be damned to stay beside you

[Chorus]

All that you see you devour
The money the greed and the power
You always did you always will

Now I know the truth about you
All you need I will deny you
