And they cry
And they call
As the wayward walk alone

City lights
Urban sprawl
In a place no one should know

Shown no grace
Shown no love
These mean streets are meant for none

[Chorus:]
Take them back to the start
Let the purest of heart
Know their worth is still spoken

As they fight to exist
We neglect and resist
Let this circle be broken

Broken homes
Broken lives
They repeat themselves in time

It's passed on
Down the line
Till we heal the wounds inside

It's not too late
To make things right
Dress wounds with loves pure light

[Chorus]

They're still waiting
They still cry
They still want to know they'll be all right

All I'm saying
Can we try?
To bring the wayward ones back home tonight
Bring the wayward one back home tonight

[Chorus]
