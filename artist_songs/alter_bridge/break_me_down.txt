It's too late the time has come
I've kept this inside me for way too long
Silence will leave me cold
Lost on a highway that never takes me home

[Chorus:]
I want to step aside
I want to give it up
Before I lose it all
It's tearing me inside
The way you break me down

Oh there will come a time
When I will come undone
And you will let me fall
I'll leave it all behind
Before you break me down

The weight of a thousand lies
Promises broken haunt me all the time
You say that you're sure to change
But that black heart reveals that
You'll always stay the same

[Chorus]

I realize
Forgiveness
Is calling
And it's calling

I've denied
The reason
I'm falling
And I'm falling

So let go

[Chorus]
