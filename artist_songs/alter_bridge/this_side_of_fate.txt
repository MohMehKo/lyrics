This side of fate is blind
The choice has been made, it's time

For all that we've done
Will we ever choose to see?
The fault of our own
This fate we must receive
We must receive

This side of fate is blind
The choice has been made, it is time

We had a dream
Now it's gone
A future revealed
We were all so very wrong
We were all so wrong

This side of fate is blind
The choice has been made, it is time

What have we done?
There's nowhere to run
Is this hopeless?

We were so wrong
Now we know it
We can't go on
Until we own it

Don't say it's over
Don't let us down
Don't turn away, we need you now

This side of fate, it is blind
The choice has been made, it is time
For all that we've done will we ever choose to see?
The fault of our own, this fate we must receive
