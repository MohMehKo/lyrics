Sitting by the telephone
Waiting for what never comes
A chance to be the chosen one is all but gone
Arise the tide within your heart
A longing for another start
Far beyond the wretched place that you've come to know

Are you finally losing patience?
May you rise, your time has come
May you fight for what's been taken
Find your strength when there is none

A message from so long ago
Reminding you that you let go
Why did you throw it all away, it still haunts your soul
But now you see what's come to pass
You're screaming for a second chance
If life is what you make of it then make it your own

Are you finally losing patience?
May you rise, your time has come
May you fight for what's been taken
Find your strength when there is none
Know your life is still worth saving
Can't you see how far you've come?
If you find you're losing patience
Then just rise, your time has come

Your time has come

This may be the only way you've got
A second chance to turn the page, move on
If you choose to wallow in these sorrows what will be the cost?
If you did and follow your tomorrow, find where you belong
Move on, move on

Are you finally losing patience?
May you rise, your time has come
May you fight for what's been taken
Find your strength when there is none
Know your life is still worth saving

May you fight for what's been taken

Your time has come
If life is what you make of it then make it your own
