There's something creeping just beyond the door
And it's raging like we've never seen before, oh

Annihilate
Eradicate
We'll be erased
We cannot run, we only crawl
Obliterate
There's no escape
We must remain
Or there'll be nothing left at all

Nothing left at all

The symphony of agony plays on
We pay the price, the last in line to fall
As the symphony plays on

Suffering, are we lost in genocide?
Though we're aching, I won't give up without a fight, oh

But the pain
It never fades
It overtakes
Won't beg for mercy, though we could
It's not too late
We'll find a way
Beyond this fate
And we will fight forever more

Fight forever more

The symphony of agony plays on
We pay the price, the last in line to fall
As the symphony plays on

There can be no compromise when you know it's wrong
'Cause in the end the sacrifice was worthless all along

The symphony of agony plays on
We pay the price, the last in line to fall
