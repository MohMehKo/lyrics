Hope [echos]
The only thing that we have left to hold [echos]
In a world gone mad there's nowhere left to go [echos]
Where nothing lasts there's permanence I know

Is there something I can say?
To bring back what once remained
Where is all that we let go?
Where is home?

Doubt [echos]
From inside I hear it calling out [echos]
Tearing at the truth it must be found [echos]
In the end it only brings me down

Is there something I can say?
To bring back what once remained
Where is all that we let go?
Where is home?

If you need a reason a reason tonight
To cast every doubt from your heart and from your mind
Look to tomorrow and maybe you'll find
Something more. Something more.

Is there something I can say?
To bring back what once remained
Where is all that we let go?
Where is home?
