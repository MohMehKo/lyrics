Crack the heart with true intentions 
Blood and scars and no redemption 
We’ve been a slave to your disaster 
Lost it all it doesn’t matter 

And we don’t care at all 
We got nothing to take on 
And leave the rest to fall 
We’re going back where we belong 

Waste aways amount to nothing 
But your opinions keep on coming 
We’re dead inside to your rejection 
Risk it all and did I mention 

I’ll say it again 
I’ll say it again 

And we don’t care at all 
We got nothing to take on 
And leave the rest to fall 
We’re going back where we belong 

Never doubt it 
Never question 
What we were 
And where we’ve been 
Scream out loud 
As our intentions 
Find a word 

And we don’t care at all 
We got nothing to take on 
And leave the rest to fall 
We’re going back where we belong 

I’ll say it again 

And we don’t care at all 
We got nothing to take on 
And leave the rest to fall 
We’re going back where we belong
