Sitting alone in the cold of the night
You’re trying to find what you need to survive
 You're so afraid
You can’t go on
Left in the silence that tears at your heart
It only reminds you how broken you are
You lost your way
But hope is not gone

Cause the sun always sets
The moon always falls
It feels like the end
Just pay no mind at all
And keep rolling
Rolling
Life must go on

Do you remember and long for the past
When love was eternal and joy seemed to last
Yesterday
Forever is gone

Cause the sun always sets
The moon always falls
It feels like the end
Just pay no mind at all
And keep rolling
Rolling
Life must go on
It must go on

We have our misfortunes
The darkest of days
But we must endure
And keep strong
Just look to the morning
The promise awaits
And know that this life must go on

And the sun always sets
The moon always falls
It feels like the end
Just pay no mind at all
And keep rolling
Rolling
Life must go on

And the sun always sets
The moon always falls
It feels like the end
Just pay no mind at all
And keep rolling
Keep rolling
Life must go on
It must go on

Life must go on
Life must go on
(When you feel you're awake)
So you keep holding on
Keep holding on
(We all have our mistakes)
Life must go on
Life must go on
So you keep holding on
Keep holding on
