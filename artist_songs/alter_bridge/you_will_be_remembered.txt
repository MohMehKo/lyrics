I wrote these words to tell you all the things I should've said so long ago
So long ago
Know that I am grateful I will not forget or let your memory go
No, I won't
I waited way too long
Way too long

I know this life's a mystery, we lose the things we never can replace
No
So many things we keep inside are never said until it's much too late
Oh

So I'm giving you this song

For the ones who sacrifice it all, we will sing
Who took a stand so we would never fall, we will sing
You will always be a hero, we will sing
So you will be remembered
You will be remembered

I know you've suffered way too much, I know you gave your all for us to be
Oh, I see
I know how much you've sacrificed and all of this you did so selflessly
Oh

So I'm giving you this song
I'm giving you this song

For the ones who sacrifice it all, we will sing
Who took a stand so we would never fall, we will sing
You will always be a hero, we will sing

You'll be remembered, you're still alive
Your memory will survive
And in the end, all your sacrifice
It made a difference this time

So I'm giving you this song
And I'm giving you this song

For the ones who sacrificed it all, we will sing
Who took a stand so we would never fall, we will sing
You will always be a hero, we will sing
So you will be remembered
So you will be remembered
