When all the lights are faded
The encore’s come and gone
And I can’t take this no more
Well I can’t keep pretending
I just can’t play the part
I need the solace of her shores

Coeur d’Alene is calling out
And it won’t be long
Coeur d’Alene I’m coming now
Will I still belong

I look into the mirror
I don’t know who I am
A life so torn apart
I still long for the simple
I’m just a common man
Ye with this aching heart

Coeur d’Alene is calling out
And it won’t be long
Coeur d’Alene I’m coming now
Will I still belong

Safe at last in your arms
I’m safe at last in your arms

Coeur d’Alene is calling out
Where its water is calm
Coeur d’Alene I’m coming now
And it won’t be long
And it won’t be long
And it won’t be long

Safe at last
(and it won’t be long)
I’m safe at last
(and it won’t be long)
