How long will you cower down
Until you come to see
That courage is the hallowed ground
That changes destiny?
That only those who dare to win
With no fear have no remorse
The time has come to rise again
You were meant to be much more

Somehow
Somehow

It's like poison in your veins
Oh, it's the beast you cannot tame
The way you let your fear burrow inside
Will chew you up and spit you out in time
Release the poison in your veins right now
Right now, oh

Everything that could've been
Has only failed to be
Cause you wasted all your precious time
You were too afraid to dream
Well, damn it all to hell I say
Don't you waste another day
It's time for you to own it now
The world is yours to take

Right now

It's like poison in your veins
Oh, it's the beast you cannot tame
The way you let your fear burrow inside
Will chew you up and spit you out in time
So release the poison in your veins
So come on bleed it out, it's not too late
What you choose to see is falling short
It's time for you to rise and be much more

Don't waste another day
Don't let it slip away
The world is all yours to take
If only you could change

Oh it's like poison in your veins
Oh, it's the beast you cannot tame
The way you let your fear burrow inside
Will chew you up and spit you out in time
So release the poison in your veins
Come on bleed it out, it's not too late
What you choose to see is falling short
It's time for you to rise and be much more
Release the poison in your veins right now
Right now
Right now
Right now
