Yeah...
Close your eyes and just hear me sing
One last long good bye
One last song before you spread your wings
There's so much left to say
And before this moment slips away

What a wonderful life
For as long as you've been at my side
And I want you to know
I loved you so

The cold night calls
And the tears fall like rain
It's so hard letting go
Of the one thing I'll never replace
And soon you will be gone
But these words they will live on
Ohhhhh

What a wonderful life
For as long as you've been at my side
And I want you to know
I'll miss you so
And though our days come to an end
Know I'll never love like this again
What a wonderful life
My friend

And all that I am you let me be
I will remember you
For all that you've done
And given to me
Oh love will remain
This I concede
Now and forever more
Because of you now I believe
I believe

What a wonderful life
For as long as you've been at my side
And I want you know
I loved you so
What a wonderful life
For as long as you've been at my side
And I want you to know
I'll miss you so

And though our days come to an end
Know I'll never love like this again
What a wonderful life [x4]
And with one last embrace
As the tears fall like rain you're gone
And with one last goodbye
As you fade out tonight you're gone.
Ohhh...
