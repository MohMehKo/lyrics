Are you still lost tonight?
Living but dead inside
This is a proclamation
This is a call to rise

Are you abused, alone?
Walking with broken bones
If you feel you've been forgotten
Let this song guide you home

We are the disillusioned
We've been left wanting more
Before every aspiration hits the floor

[Chorus:]
Hold on for your life
All we feel is so far from alive
The damned are done believing
The cursed can dream no more
So hold on for your life
Because only the strong survive

The tell you what you should be
Sell you the plastic dream
Opinions are all provided
But nothing is what it seems

I dare you to take control
Cause empty are hands and
Bruised are the souls
Of those who show no resistance
Of those who are weak below

We are the disenchanted
Who die with each passing day
No one here understands us so I say

[Chorus]

How will it feel?
To live a lie until your dying day
Where nothing is real
As we sacrifice bending until we break
It's been revealed
Hold on for your life
Dreams are not theirs to take...
Dreams are not theirs to take

[Chorus]

I said only the strong survive
