I twist and turn
In the darkest space
Can't find my worth
As I numb the pain

Glass to the sky
With a blacktooth grin
This whiskey smile
Takes me down again

I'm cold and I'm so afraid
That I'm too weak and I can't change

[Chorus:]
I've been buried alive and
I don't want to be here anymore

Reached out a thousand times for
A hand to pull me from below

I've been buried alive in a world
Of constant sorrow

Reach down tonight and set me free...
Save tomorrow

Another shot
Slip into the haze
Another night
Soaked in my disgrace

Toast to the lie
I'll raise my glass and run
A wasted life
What have I become?

[Chorus]

Save tomorrow
Save tomorrow

Let me breathe again
Show me where I begin
To find the will to change
Before I lose everything

[Chorus]

Reach down tonight and set me free
And I will follow
