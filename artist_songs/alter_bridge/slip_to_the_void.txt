Slip to the void
To the dark
To the fall
Crawl to the life you shouldn't know
You should never come this way
To test the hands of fate
You don't belong here

Peel back the skin
Close your eyes
Hell is born
To the abyss but be warned
You feel what you've become
My God what have you done
You don't belong here

But it's all in the way you touch and you obey denial
But it's all in the way you touch and you obey denial

Sever the ties
Trip the wire
Dig your hole
Doubt is alive and you know
You were once lead to believe
You were young and so naive
But now no longer

But it's all in the way you turned your back today
Left to face this alone
Left to die with nothing you can hold
Left to break in the cold
In the void that you made
The moment you let love go

Try to win back your days
You let them all escape your heart
Now that you've come so far
Why did you have to fall so hard
Look at what you've done
What have you become

Left to face this alone
Left to die with nothing you can hold
Left to break in the cold
In the void that you made
The moment you let love go
You let love go
You let love go
You let love go
