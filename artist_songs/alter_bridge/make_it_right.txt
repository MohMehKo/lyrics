How many times have you cut
Only to feel no pain?
How many days have you run
Only to crawl?

How many nights did you scream
Only to scream in vain?
How many years till you face
The shame of it all?

Into the fire you fall
If only you could make it right
Stand up and fight for resolve
If only you can make it right

How many lies did you steal
Just to convince the fool?
How many masks did you wear
Disguised and removed?

How many years till you break
All that keeps breaking you?
How many tears will you waste
While finding the truth?

Into the fire you fall
If only you could make it right
Stand up and fight for resolve
If only you can make it right

Into the fire you fall
If only you could make it right
Stand up and fight for resolve
If only you can make it right

There comes a time (Ohhh)
When one must decide (Ohhh)
The life they are living is far from true
Lost and deceived (Ohhh)
Nothing to believe (Ohhh)
I know I have so much I have yet to prove (prove)
I've yet to prove (prove)

Into the fire you fall
If only you could make it right
Stand up and fight for resolve
If only you can make it right

Into the fire you fall
If only you could make it right
Stand up and fight for resolve
If only you can make it right
(Ooooohhhh yeahhhh...)

(There will come a time
Only you can make it right
Only you can make it right)
