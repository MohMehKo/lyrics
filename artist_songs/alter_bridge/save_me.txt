I live to hide my wicked truth
I don't suppose you know
I've hidden behind these fridged eyes
They filter what I know
It burdens me I'm never free
And peace I'll never know
I feel inside where nothing lies
And nothing left to show

So save me
I don't know, know myself
And I've been
On this isle alone, what's beyond it

It goes down below the man I know
That lives inside of me
I live inside this blackened mind
And sun is what I see
I've found at last my cruel past
It's found the end in me
I'll reach inside just one more time
For the man I'll never be

So save me
I don't know, know myself
And I've been
On this isle alone, what's beyond it
So crawl inside
I reach for the sign, I will need it
The gain was mine
To gather control, I will lost it

When will it end
