Looking down a road, a pair of eyes
And it makes me free, I never lie
And you know I think I'm paralyzed
In you

Heading down a road, a trail of tears
There he is, a failure, all those years
How did I ever get here?
I don't know

'Cause I'm on my way now
And I call for you on my way now
Chase my shadows
Have I lost my
And will I ever find my way now?

Buried in a past that made me weak
Thirty years, a faded memory
And you know I think I may believe
In you

Finally became all I feared
Broken down with nothing, all those years
How did I ever get here?
I don't know

'Cause I'm on my way now
And I call for you on my way now
Chase my shadows
Have I lost my
And will I ever find my way now?

We shed away your fears
And will you lead me when I'm lost
No matter what the cost?
And will you shed a whole new light?
Will you teach my soul to sing?
Will you lead me in the end?

Or will it be too late?
Have I lost my will to give?
Have I lost my way again?

'Cause I'm on my way now
And I call for you on my way now
Chase my shadows
Have I lost my
And will I ever find my way now?
