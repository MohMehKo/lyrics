In your head monsters call
In the air you find no one
Is there at all

But you keep them alive
Paralyzed you cannot run
You only crawl

[Chorus]
So find a new way to live
Before you die in the cold
And though the sky's caving in
The fear must not gain control

And do not worry my friend
Or make this call by your sole
And find a new way to live
Before your fate's set in stone

Will it come to an end?
What you fear you must confess
Is what you want

Will you ever survive
All the monsters of the mind
Where all is wrong?

[Chorus]
So find a new way to live
Before you die in the cold
And though the sky's caving in
The fear must not gain control

And do not worry my friend
Or make this call by your sole
And find a new way to live
Before your fate's set in stone

It pulls me down like the heaviest of stone
And I am only flesh and bone
And so I walk through this valley all alone
I can't take this anymore
No

{I just can't take this anymore}
{I just can't take this anymore}

[Chorus]
So find a new way to live
Before you die in the cold
And though the sky's caving in
The fear must not gain control

And do not worry my friend
Or make this call by your sole
And find a new way to live
Before your fate's set in stone
