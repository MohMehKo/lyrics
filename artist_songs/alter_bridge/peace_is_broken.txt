All the sorrows that you've known
All the wars that you wage
I'm bearing arms against your own
As you throw your life away

[Chorus:]
The peace is broken
You did it all yourself with you and no one else to blame
The peace is broken
The trouble in your heart is self imposed and hard to tame
The peace is broken

Oh can't you see what you've become?
As you crawl to your own grave
When everything is said and done
You will find that it's too late

[Chorus]

All the sorrows that you've known, all the wars that you wage

Lost to every worry every sorrow in your heart
Everything is blurry now you've torn your world apart
None of this will matter, not tomorrow just today
Don't let this moment slip away

[Chorus]
