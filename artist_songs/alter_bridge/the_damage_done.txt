I won’t waste away
I won’t let this take me down
I can’t survive
As long as I keep it around

I wish it would fade
But it will just sell me out
Over and over and over
I cried out loud

SOMEBODY SAVE ME…
SOMEBODY SAVE ME…

THE RACE I RUN
I KEEPS ME farther ON
THE MAN I COULD BECOME

THE DAMAGE DONE
I WANT TO WASH THE FILTH AWAY
TILL THERE IS NONE

I run till I break
From the way it was killing me
Profuse to the day
I’ll suffer afraid to speak

I carry the shame
And beg for a remedy
How long must I live
With the damage of my disease

SOMEBODY SAVE ME…
SOMEBODY SAVE ME…

THE RACE I RUN
I KEEPS ME farther ON
THE MAN I COULD BECOME

THE DAMAGE DONE
I WANT TO WASH THE FILTH AWAY
TILL THERE IS NONE

THE RACE I RUN
I KEEPS ME farther ON
THE MAN I COULD BECOME

THE DAMAGE DONE
I WANT TO WASH THE FILTH AWAY
TILL THERE IS NONE
