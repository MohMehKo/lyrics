Who could love a man like me?
Who would even want to share the air I breathe?
I've been so wild like a dirty rotten dog,
And they should shoot me for the blood drawn with my teeth.

I never loved before I found you.
As if you ever hid from me.
Love is not a word or a soft romantic verse,
Or a soul that's trapped behind computer screens.

And they'll all say I'm not a Christian man.
They'll claim I wrote this song to sell.
If they only knew
About the things that I've gone through
They wouldn't wish I'd burn in hell.

Well I have fought too many times
But I don't think I've ever won.
Swung for the fences.
Wasn't raised to be defenseless
But you learn that you just can't fight everyone

I know they'll always talk about me
But you won't ever see me run.
They can black my eyes,
They can shoot me with a gun
But you'll never kill the man that I've become.

And they'll all say I'm not a Christian man.
They'll claim I wrote this song to sell.
If they only knew
That's exactly what I used to do
And why I still think I should burn in hell.

Who could love a man like me?
The one that gives me air to breathe.
The same one that I have hung upon a cross
Would get down on the ground and wash my feet for me.
