I'm not afraid of the dark anymore
I'm just afraid that I won't find the light
I'd kill myself if you promised me heaven
Cause I'm just too tired to put up a fight
I heard your words when I was just a boy
So there's no excuse for the path that I chose
When I'm on my knees out in front of your gates
Then I won't make excuses when that gate is closed

I know I don't deserve you but I can't do this alone
I'm so sick of laying here on my own

I wish you'd carry me home
Take me away from this house
I hate to say this wretched man
That you have made to look like you
Don't look a damn thing like you now
I used to smile so much
But then I blocked out your son
I'm just another man that's broken his own heart
It's no wonder that I'm always quick to run
I'm always quick to run

I'm gonna die in this ocean alone
I lay on my back and I pray that I float
I thought that I had the world on a string
But now the whole world wants me hung from a rope

I know I don't deserve you but I can't do this alone
I'm so sick of laying here on my own

I wish you'd carry me home
Take me away from this house
I hate to say this wretched man
That you have made to look like you
Don't look a damn thing like you now
I used to smile so much
But then I blocked out your son
I'm just another man that's broken his own heart
It's no wonder that I'm always quick to run
I'm always quick to run

You pumped the blood into my heart
I poured out poison from my lips
I'm broken down in front of you
I've come to break like porcelain
I hate the bastard I became
Far from the man that I've become
You should have left me long ago
I wish that I had never run

I wish you'd carry me home
Take me away from this house
I hope and pray that every day
This wretched man that you have saved
Could start to look like you somehow
