She left on Sunday.
No goodbye kiss.
You got the house
But you lost where you live.
With just a box of wine
And the old TV that don't work right.
You took your pills
But you're still shaking inside.

Pick up the bottle and it will let you down
Fill up your veins and you will still feel without.
Well you can find a woman and she'll hold you tight
Cause she don't know the demons that you hold inside
The wrong roads seem easier when you've lost your mind.

You watch your favorite show,
And think of her laugh.
You turn it off and hope
The feeling will pass.
Catch your reflection,
And you wish couldn't see it
You smash the screen but
You're the one that falls to pieces.

Pick up the bottle and it will let you down
Fill up your veins and you will still feel without.
Well you can find a woman and she'll hold you tight
Cause she don't know the demons that you hold inside
The wrong roads seem easier when you've lost your mind.

I know you're lonely son,
But you are not the only one.
The wolves are vicious but
They will kneel when he is done.
Put on your armor son.
The battle here has just begun
But have faith and know that
This war's already won.

Put down the bottle and reach for the light.
Wipe off the mud for you are no longer blind.
You know there is nothing you will ever find
That could fill the void that he leaves inside.
Lay down your burdens son and open your eyes.

Put down the bottle and reach for the light.
Wipe off the mud for you are no longer blind.
You know there is nothing you will ever find
That could fill the void that he leaves inside.
Lay down your burdens son and open your eyes.
