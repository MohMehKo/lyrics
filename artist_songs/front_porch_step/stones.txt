I know that I've made mistakes,
And I'm aware I've told some lies.
I'm sorry that I broke your heart.
You'll be glad to know that I broke mine.
Well I lost two good friends this year,
And I buried both my dogs,
So if you think that I've been hiding out of fear,
Then you just don't know me at all

You can hate me if you want to.
That's if you think you've got a right.
Just make sure that you're not jumping to conclusions
Before you go to draw your knife.

I never meant to hurt a soul,
But just keep saying what you will.
I just tried to use the earth to fill a hole,
I've found that God can only fill.
I learned a lot of things this year
But there's one thing that helped the most.
It's okay to burn a bridge down to the ground,
Right where you should've built a moat.

I can feel the pressure coming over me like setting sails.
Tried to come to my senses,
But sometimes they tend to fail.
And I tried to come out swinging
But I couldn't hold back tears.
It's no wonder that a can of soup
Can't get me through this year.
And I've taken advantage of the debt that Jesus paid
And I'm scared my heart has damage
From the wars that I have waged
And its true before, I've been a whore like Mary Magdalene,
And I've felt stones that crack my bones,
I'm just glad that God stepped in.
I'm glad that God stepped in.

Well, there's a Father that forgives,
And there's a God that knows the truth.
So I'm not scared to face his Judgment.
I'm just scared that you will too.
So you can go burn all my records,
And put me six feet in the ground.
There's still a flame that burns forever in my heart
Your hatred just cannot put out.
