I feel this darkness creep like thunder.
It's rolling straight into my spine.
I feel temptation pull me under.
My gold has lost all of its shine.
I try so hard to stay together
When everything's falling apart.
I said that I'd stay gold forever.
It seems that I've misplaced my heart

Save me from myself. Hold me down.
Lock me away. Don't let me out.
Tie up my wrists and have me shot.
Please save yourselves. So help me God.

I once was pushed when I was younger.
I gashed my knee, and I loved the pain
(Oh how I loved to feel the pain)
And suddenly I had the hunger
To rise up and make him feel the same
(I think that's when I went insane)
I pushed him back but I pushed harder
I watched him slam into the ground
(I watched him slam into the ground)
One day I'll die but I'm no martyr
And I fear that hell is where I'm bound

Save me from myself. Hold me down.
Lock me away. Don't let me out.
Tie up my wrists and have me shot.
Please save yourselves. So help me God.
So help me God.

This gunshot will drown out the noise in my head
But these bloodstains won't cover the shame in my bed
And I can't think about it cause I don't have the time
Cause either way I'll lose my mind.

Save me from myself. Hold me down.
Lock me away. Don't let me out.
Tie up my wrists and have me shot.
Please save yourselves. So help me God.

Save me from myself. Hold me down.
Lock me away. Don't let me out.
Tie up my wrists and have me shot.
Please save yourselves. So help me God.
