Lord don't take me as I am
I'm not worthy of your love
They drove nails into your hands
I've only trampled on your blood

I've been so quick to curse your name 
Because I saw an empty well
I was too blind to feel your rein 
Lord I deserve to burn in hell

But you'll still take me as I am
Despite the dark inside of me
A sinner dead and to be damned 
You asked to keep me company

Lord don't take me as I am
This life does not belong to me 
I welcome you into my heart 
And lord I pray you never leave 

Cause' you'll still take me as I am
Despite the dark inside of me
A sinner dead and to be damned 
You asked to keep me company 

And Lord I know I have to change
I see my sin and hate it too
A dead man running toward the flames
I spit into your face
You loved me when I hated you

I'm glad you take me as I am
I'm greatful for the air I breathe 
There is nothing I deserve 
There's still one thing I ask of thee

That you'll break me like bread to better feed your crowd 
And make thee weep for souls that do not know your crowd
Lord let them persecute me
Let them beat me down
Lord help me hurt like you somehow

Lord help me hurt like you somehow
