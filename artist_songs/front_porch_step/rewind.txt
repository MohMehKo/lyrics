Well this old train is broken down.
But I'm glad it crumbled when it did.
It's kinda hard to stay on track
Running through the darkness of your sin.

Someday you'll wake up and find,
You wish that you could rewind
Take back mistakes that you made
Mend all the hearts that you break.
Forgive but don't forget
To love those that want you dead.
Your biggest enemy resides inside your head.

The boys are going out tonight
They're probably looking for a fight.
The rest are searching for another broken heart
Cause they're convinced that they will get them through the night.

Someday you'll wake up and find,
You wish that you could rewind
Take back mistakes that you made
Mend all the hearts that you break.
Forgive but don't forget
To love those that want you dead.
Your biggest enemy resides inside your head.

I just wanted to be famous.
I tried to make Ohio proud.
But I grew up worshiping Hank Williams
And not the God he sang about.

Someday you'll wake up and find,
You wish that you could rewind
Take back mistakes that you made
Mend all the hearts that you break.
Forgive but don't forget
To love those that want you dead.
Your biggest enemy resides inside your head.
