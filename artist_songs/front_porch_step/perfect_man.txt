Keep your lips away from me.
I don't want to feel your touch.
'Cause your heart is lacking truth,
And your words don't come from love.
I'd say mess with someone else,
That's not something that you need.
'Cause your soul is bent for hell,
And your heart has been diseased.

I know that I'm not perfect,
But I'm far from worthless.
You'll need more than curves to make me care.
You're trying to control me.
Bringing up the old me.
Honey we both know that's not fair.
You just made a perfect man inside your mind
And you got mad
When I could not compare.

There is blood stains on my clothes,
But it don't come from my wrist.
It just trickles down my nose,
When I think about your kiss.

Baby, I know that I'm not perfect,
But I'm far from worthless.
You'll need more than curves to make me care.
You're trying to control me.
Bringing up the old me.
Honey we both know that's not fair.
You just made a perfect man inside your mind
And you got mad
When I could not compare.

We can never be together,
'Cause you'll never understand
That I am not less human
'Cause I'm not a perfect man.
I am not a perfect man.

Baby, I know that I'm not perfect,
But I'm far from worthless.
You'll need more than curves to make me care.
You're trying to control me.
Bringing up the old me.
Honey we both know that's not

Baby, I know that I'm not perfect,

You'll need more than curves to make me care.
You're trying to control me.
Bringing up the old me.
Honey we both know that's not fair.
You just made a perfect man inside your mind
And you got mad
When I could not compare.

You just made a perfect man inside your mind
