Well I see you standing there and your eyes are unaware
That I've been staring at them all night, wishing the brain behind them cared
About the way you make me feel or how your smile makes me nervous
Or how the fact that you exist makes me feel like I have a purpose

I'm sick of lying in your bed while we're both laying down
You say you want me for a friend. I hope you know I hate that sound
But I will bite my tongue because I hate when you're pissed off
But you should know I need your touch like falling rain on thirsty crops

Damn you stupid girl. Why won't you drop your guard?
The space between our lips is bound to break my ever aching heart
And I am sure that you will never find a man that is ever gonna love you more.
So why won't you love me?

Well I hate your cigarettes and the men that you go see
Because one is killing you, while the other's killing me
But I know that you'll stay stubborn because you know I'll stay alone
'Cause we both know, inside your grasp, is the only place I feel at home

Now I sit with my guitar. Write you one more stupid song
I hate the way you make me feel like I'm doing something wrong
But you'll just have to deal with all the things that I have mentioned
And I hope this song is golden like the point of my intentions. But...

Damn you stupid girl. Why won't you drop your guard?
The space between our lips is bound to break my ever aching heart
And I am sure that you will never find a man that is ever gonna love you more.
So why won't you love me?

Now the deed is done and there is nothing left to say
Prayed to the God you don't believe in, that you'll love me some day
So when the years go by and you forget how much I care
Put in this song and sing along so your heart will be aware

It's like giving up on everything that you believe
To put your trust in a girl that stole your heart right off your sleeve
And I'm so sure that you will never find a man that is ever gonna love you more
But you just won't love me
