I know you left me long ago but I've been longing since you left,
To fill this empty space that you created on this lonely bed.
And I know its not my fault but I'm the one that's getting hurt.
You sit upon your whorish throne while I drown in shit I don't deserve.
You left your t shirt in my room. It used to smell like your perfume.
I choked up when it was burning but I blamed it on the fumes,
And my pulse goes off the charts when I can see you on the streets.
I know you ripped my life apart but you won't get what's left of me.

So I will run away, and get out of this town in hope I never see your face,
And I'll take back my heart and rid my life of you so that my life can finally start.

I'm so done with feeling numb that I've been pissing in the breeze.
Not matter how much these girls come, they never miss their chance to leave,
And I swear you rule my mind, but how I wish you never left.
Now I miss you all the time, and I just eat myself to death
You left your t shirt in my room. It used to smell like your perfume.
I choked up when it was burning but I blamed it on the fumes. Now I'll run so far away.
Maybe ill run until I die, but if my journey ends with that, at least we'll both be satisfied.

I saw the beauty in your oak, so I ate the apple from your tree.
I thought I had you for myself. How many shared your fruit with me?
