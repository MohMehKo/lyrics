So cold is the wind, it blows your hair
So warm is your touch upon my skin
How tired am I of being scared
But how awake am I now that I know you're here

'Cause I'd rather fight with you than laugh with another
I'd rather freeze in your arms than be warm under covers
And I'd let you hit me before I ever let you hit the floor

And I'd rather choke than to breathe in your absence
I'd rather feel your wrath than feel another's passion
And I'd rather die on the day that I give you a kiss
Than spend the rest of my life knowing I never did

So just hold me and tell me that I'm everything you need
Tell me that, that lonely little heart of yours that I've been dying for ain't out of reach

So if you're looking for some proof that there's a heart inside of me
Then lace your fingers between mine and you will see it start to leak
And I know you're not a crutch but I can hold you when I stand
'Cause I am living for your touch but I would die to be your man

Let me look into your eyes like I am searching for your soul
Wrap my arms around your waist like it is dying from the cold
Run my fingers through your hair like they are water from the drain
Press my lips against your back like they could take away its pain

And to give you everything, there is nothing I won't do
Dump my heart into a blender just to pour it out to you
And I know you're feeling tired. Just let me hold you for a bit
Dive my face between your thighs until I cannot feel my lips

Well, I know that you think I'm kind of odd
But if your love was a mountain, I swear that I'd climb to the top
I would tell you, "You're lovely and everything I'll ever need,
And I would give you my all if you'd just come and stand next to me."
