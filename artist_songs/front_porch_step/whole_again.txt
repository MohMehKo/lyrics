I Found You Broken, And I Lost My Need For Sleep
You Bit My Lip, And We Were Both In Way To Deep

The Scars Across Your Wrists, Displayed For All To See
But The Skeletons I Hide Have Much Thicker Skin Than Me

No Form Of Study Could Have Made Come Prepared
Your Arms Around My Neck Became My Cross To Bear

You Made Me Whole Again. you gave me sense of peace
You Took The Knives Out Of My Back And Let Me Bleed Out
All The Anger And The Madness. I'd give my life To Make You Laugh
If You Would Give The Time To Spend Your Life With Me

You Made Me Whole Again

Your Freckled Face, Your Hair Like Autumn Leaves
Your Skin Like Milk Had Made Me Jealous Of Your Sleeves

You Found Me Broken, And You Helped Me Fall Asleep
Your Theft Of My Heart, somehow made me feel complete

You Made Me Whole Again. You gave me sense of peace
You Took The Knives Out Of My Back And Let Me Bleed Out
All The Anger And The Madness. I'd give my life To Make You Laugh
If You Would Give The Time To Spend Your Life With Me

You Made Me Whole Again
You Made Me Whole Again
You Made Me Whole Again
You Made Me Whole Again

[x2:]
I said I wouldn't love, but you came and called my bluff
Now I would die of thirst if I could only fill your cup

You Made Me Whole Again. You brought me to my knees
You Took The Knives Out Of My Back And Let Me Bleed Out
All The Anger And The Madness. Id give my life To Make You Laugh
If You Would Give The Time To Spend Your Life With Me

You Make Me Whole Again
You Make Me Whole Again

Oh You Make Me Whole Again

You Make Me Whole
You Make Me Whole
You Make Me Whole Again

You Make Me Whole
You Make Me Whole
You Make Me Whole
You Make Me Whole
You Make Me Whole
You Make Me Whole
You Make Me Whole
You Make Me Whole
