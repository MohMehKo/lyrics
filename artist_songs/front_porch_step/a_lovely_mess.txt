I'm not the man that I once was
But I'm changing every day because I want to find someone like you
And you've got eyes that can tear me down
But all they do is build me up
So hold my hand before my heart erupts

And darling I may not be everything you want
But I can give you all I have
I'm not the perfect man
But you are just so perfect and I want to be the one that holds your hand

I'm sorry if I come off strong
And it could be that you're all wrong for me
But I just had to see
Cause you are broken and I am such a wreck
I think we'd make a lovely mess

And darling I may not be everything you want
But I can give you all I have
I'm not the perfect man
But you are just so perfect and I want to be the one that holds your hand

Some day we could wake up in a bed we call our own
I would buy you lots of flowers
And someday I'd build your home
I would sing you Frank Sinatra while we sway along and dance
This life of course could be all yours if you would just give me a chance

And darling I may not be everything you want
But I can give you all that I have
I'm not the perfect man
But you are just so perfect and I want to be the one that holds your hand

I'm not those men that made you cry
And I promise I will spend my life just trying to make you feel alive
Cause you are broken and I am such a wreck
I swear I'll love you till I'm dead
