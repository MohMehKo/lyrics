Father I'm sorry I've hurt you
I'm sorry I've stumbled like this
This heart that still beats from the breath of your lips
Is a heart that'd kill you with a kiss
And I know that you still choose to love me
And it's something that I cannot earn
But I turned away and I ran toward the flames
What a wonderful way to get burned

What a wonderful way to get burned
You gave me it all, I threw it away
I played with the fire
What a wonderful way to get burned

I faked love with a tall glass of water
Wasn't long before she had her fill
'Cause she had enough of the lack of our love
And now she's going out for the kill
And you told me you'd love me forever
But Jesus, will you ever learn
That your place in my heart has been filled with such dark
You won't see me when you have returned

What a wonderful way to get burned
You gave me it all, I threw it away
I played with the fire
What a wonderful way to get burned
You gave me it all, I threw it away
I played with the fire
What a wonderful way
What a wonderful way
What a wonderful way

You brought air to my lungs and then I turned my back
You still loved me despite but I hated the fact
That I hated myself more than I ever loved
So the love that you had was just not good enough
And I miss you so much that it burns in my chest
Like the first cigarette that I smoked to impress
If I had known then what I've done to you now
I'd pour gas on myself with it lit in my mouth

What a wonderful way to get burned
You gave me it all, I threw it away
I played with the fire
What a wonderful way to get burned
You gave me it all, I threw it away
I played with the fire
What a wonderful way
What a wonderful way
What a wonderful way
To get burned
