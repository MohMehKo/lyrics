Well I've never felt this way before as you control my eyes.
I lose my sense of ignorance as my hands run up your thighs.
I tremble as I smell your hair, my lungs struggle to breath
I'm sinking deep into your sheets, wont you come drown with me?

And I swear I'm not the type to push, but I'm bound to pull your hair.
So grab my heart and hold my hand as you lead me up the stairs...
and let me lay you down tonight and make you lose your mind.
Shut off our phones and all the clocks cause we control the time.
Don't think about the consequences put your fears aside.
Just let me lay you down tonight and make you lose your mind.
Mm mmm mmm.

Even science cant explain the power of your lips.
Staring deep into your soul exposes all your bliss.
Lets pretend this world is ours and no one is around.
I've lost control, I cant let go I've got to have you now.

And I swear I'm not the type to push, but I'm bound to pull your hair.
So grab my heart and hold my hand as you lead me up the stairs...

and let me lay you down tonight and make you lose your mind.
Shut off our phones and all the clocks cause we control the time.
Don't think about the consequences put your fears aside.
Just let me lay you down tonight and make you lose your mind.

I find my fingers wondering right up and down your spine.
I'm thanking god for all his work in making this design.
You wonder if my love for you is driven by my lust.
Well I love your soul with all my heart, your body's just a plus.

And I swear I'm not the type to push, but I'm bound to pull your hair.
So grab my heart and hold my hand as you lead me up the stairs...

Come lay with me.
We don't need clothes.
But I need you more then...you'll ever know.

So let me lay you down tonight and make you lose your mind.
Shut off our phones and all the clocks cause we control the time.
Don't think about the consequences put your fears aside.
Just let me lay you down tonight and make you lose your mind.
Mm mmm mm.
