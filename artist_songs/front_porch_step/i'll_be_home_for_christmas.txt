I'll be home for Christmas, you can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe and presents under the tree
Christmas Eve will find you where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas, if only in my dreams

I'll be home for Christmas, you can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe and presents under the tree
Christmas Eve will find you where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas, if only in my dreams
If only in my dreams
