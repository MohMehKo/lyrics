You asked for lovin'
And they gave you lines
You hungered for some truth
But they fed you lies
You asked for shelter
And they kept you trapped
You beg them to hold you
But they just hold you back

Darlin' you know, it don't mean anything
If you let his words be mistaken for proof
I hope he protects you and makes you his everything
When he tells you he loves you
Just make sure he's telling the truth

Your daddy left mama
When you were just five
So when he says forever
You just want to hide
Cause words don't mean nothing
To a heart that's been bruised
He don't need to promise
He just needs to prove

Darlin' you know, it don't mean anything
If you let his words be mistaken for proof
I hope he protects you and makes you his everything
When he tells you he loves you
Just make sure he's telling the truth

So when he holds you
And he tells you he loves you
Tell him that's something that he'll have to prove

Darlin' you know, it don't mean anything
If you let his words be mistaken for proof
I hope he protects you and makes you his everything
When he tells you he loves you
Just make sure he's telling the truth
