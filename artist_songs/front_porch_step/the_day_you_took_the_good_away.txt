I saw you standing on that bridge
Right then I knew the life that I would like to live
Your frizzy hair tangled my mind
Right then I knew that I would love you for all time
You ran your hand across the ledge
Right then I felt that all my hunger had been fed
You cracked a smile up towards the sky
That thought alone will keep me happy for my life
But I ask now...

How can angels fly when you're still on the ground?
'cause I've been searching my whole life for you to turn my life around
And now I don't know what to say because the pain won't go away
And I've been crying since the day that you took all my good away

I wish I had never walked away
'cause if I knew you'd jump, I'd dive into that bay
And I would have saved you from the cold
'cause when you took that leap you stole my heart and soul
So I ask now...

How can angels fly when you're still on the ground?
'cause I've been searching my whole life for you to turn my life around
And now I don't know what to do, 'cause I've been standing at your grave
And I've been crying since the day that you took all my good away

Your mother said you're up above
And all you wanted was a man for you to love
Well I just started breaking down
Because the angel I'd been searching for had left me on the ground
And now I'll die alone
