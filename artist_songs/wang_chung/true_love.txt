[Chorus:]
True love is the answer to everything
True love is the answer
True love is the thing

Long days spent on the edge of space oh
Maybe someone will come along love
All day with every familiar face oh
Tells me you're very very wrong love

[Chorus]

This dance could never be true enough oh
There's more that leads us to our destiny
Entranced we travelled the two of us oh
And I knew that only you could rest the world for me
I live deep in the heart of things
Feel such a part of things
That remind me of you love
And I know whatever the future brings
Wherever the pointer swings
There will always be true love
You love

[Chorus]
