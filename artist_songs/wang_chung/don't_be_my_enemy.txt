You had your dreams
You required a scheme of things
That evolved and resolved through the years
And I had my part
(When you wrote me out)
But you broke my heart
(When you wrote me out)
Now you spend your whole time trying
To burn me to the ground

[Chorus:]
Don't be my enemy
Can't you see
What you're doing to me
Don't be my enemy
Can't you see
What an effect this is having on me?

I had a thought
It was just a simple thought
Of a friend, very close, very clear
But then it stopped looking so straight
(When you wrote me out)
You found the hate
(When you wrote me out)
Now you spend your whole time trying to make
Me look like your main fool

[Chorus]
