It's good to have a good time
It's good to let your feelings be known
It's good to go out dancing
And it's good to have your people back home
The fashions, oh they're way out babe
I love the colour of your hair
Darling can we go now, oh no
I don't think that you care

Why do you laugh
When everybody's crying
Why do you laugh
When everybody's crying
Why do you, Why do you
Oh why?
Is it just that you don't notice
Is it so long since a tear passed your eye?

As your light is gone I'm gone
I seem to get me nowhere
The boys that try to raise a laugh
But there's nothing to smile about down there
And all the faces you're so bored
I know you've heard it all before
But what frightened me is all those people
What they want is more and more
