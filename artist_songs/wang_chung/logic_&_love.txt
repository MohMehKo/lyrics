Love and logic just don't go together
Try to force it, you'll be trying forever
Why discuss it when you're missing the point
Girl
Forget the fakin' all I care is that you're

[Chorus:]
Making all the right moves
You're making all the moves that hit the spot
You're speaking only half-truths girl
Just tell me all the things I like a lot
Stop thinking you're much too intense
Don't even try to make love make sense
Don't even try to make love make sense
Don't even try to say we're just good friends

Logic and love clash in your head
You don't see reason you just see red
We could argue 'till you're blue in the face girl
The time you're taking is the time you could be

[Chorus]

I'm talking logic and love
I'm talking logic and love

Our scientific world demands that everything's
Explained
You're an ultra-modern girl
But can't you see there's nothing to be gained
In analyzing love

You're making only false moves
But everything you do still hits the spot
And do you know what that proves girl
That love is far away the best we got, you know
The best of lovers don't have to be friends
Don't even try to make love make sense

Don't even try to make love make sense
Don't even try to say we're just good friends
Don't even try to make love make sense
Don't even try girl don't pretend
I'm talking logic and love
I'm talking logic and love
Logic and love
Logic and love
