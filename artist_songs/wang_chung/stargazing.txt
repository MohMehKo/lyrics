You think there's something wrong with me
You don't understand I don't want to be free
Can you make me?
Interest rates and credit squeeze
They have no weight in the fading light breeze
They're like a dream a million miles away

Now I spend all my time
Up on a hill
Perfectly still
Stargazing
Telescope to my eye
The detailed maps to hand
I understand
Stargazing

Concern the sun, watch them burn
A billion dollars for particle turned
Can you shake me?
Base on Mars
Base on Moon

The super collider will be there soon
Seeking out the furthest breath of night

Now I spend all my time
Up on a hill
Perfectly still
Stargazing
Telescope to my eye

The detailed maps to hand
I understand
Stargazing

Now I spend all my time
Up on a hill
Perfectly still
Stargazing
Telescope to my eye
The detailed maps to hand
I understand
Stargazing
Stargazing
Stargazing
Stargazing
Stargazing
(Stargazing)
Stargazing
