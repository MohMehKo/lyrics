From my window I can see the skylight
And the clouds gathering out to sea
A light rain falls
And the street lights make the road shine

And I can't sleep
People talking about the war

I can't sleep
People talking about the war
I can't sleep

Over there a clock shows half past four
And the light breaks out to sea
And I just think of those things your said to me
And I said to you and you said to me
