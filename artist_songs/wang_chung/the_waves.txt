Working at your job all day
Sends the time spinning away
Watch TV from half past six
Cook, make love and pick up sticks
But you can hear the waves crash on the beach
At night

Books you read can sublimate
Music seems to dissipate
And maybe just a bottle of wine
And a couple of smokes and you'll be fine
But you still hear the waves crash on the beach
At night
You can feel the waves crash on the beach
At night
Your lover lies beside you fast asleep
The moonlight falls upon the tears you weep
And you can hear the waves crash on the beach
At night oh at night

So all you really need is love
Love to give, receive above
And then the waves will soothe your heart
Your one true love will never part
True love (Is the answer to everything
True love is the answer true love is the thing)
True love (Is the answer to everything
True love is the answer true love is the thing)
And we will lie together both asleep
The moonlight will provide the tears we weep
And as we breathe the waves crash on the beach
At night
And as we breathe the waves crash on the beach
At night
