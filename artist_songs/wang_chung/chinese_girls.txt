A star is shining
Into my eyes
It will not fall
A star is wise
Across the harbor
Perfumed hills
The silent waters
And all is still
Oh yeah

Chinese girls stand, see right through you
Chinese girls can sway
Chinese girls will melt your heart

And take your breath away
Chinese girls would dance with god
Chinese girls don't care
Put their hands around their heads
And through their chinese hair

She is not moving
She does not talk
Birds in her hair
Where she walks
And when she gazes
There's a pearl
I will not forget
My chinese girl
