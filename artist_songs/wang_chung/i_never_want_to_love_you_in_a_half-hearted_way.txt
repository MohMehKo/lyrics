Times are hard and times will change
Things can never be the same
A love that's fallen, that makes no sense
It's better than indifference

I can't help all things I feel
But I don't need a compact seal
A love that's over, a love that's spent
I'll never be indifferent

[Chorus:]
I never want to love you in a half hearted way
Oh, oh, oh
[repeat]
I never want to love you in a half hearted way at all

So if I ever leave your hand
I know that you will understand
A love that's fallen that makes no sense
It's better than indifference
I never want to be that way

[Chorus]
