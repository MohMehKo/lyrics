I don't wanna play these games of power
I don't wanna fight this war no more
Don't wanna twist the knife
Just wanna better life for me & you & me & you

[Chorus:]
Is this what you call love
Is this what we've been fighting for
Is this what you call love
There must be so much more
Is this what you call love
Forget old scores we should be making love
Not war
Make love not war

Gotta try to break this vicious circle
Gotta find the love we've nearly lost
It's time to stop the pain
We've played the blaming game for far too long
For far too long

[Chorus]

You hurt me then I hurt you a bit more
Is this the love to end all the wars
We gotta escape this no man's land
And throw away all our battle plans

Oh yeah all right...
Oh yeah all right...
Oh yeah all right...
Oh yeah all right...
Is this what you call love
Is this what we've been fighting for

Is this what you call love
Is this what we've been fighting for
Is this what you call love
There must be so much more
This fight is not for us
Forget old scores we should be making love
Not war
Make love not war
Forget old scores we should be making love
Not war
Make love not war
