I'm picking up paper
I'm doing the things that
I never thought I'd do again
I'm writing you letters
I'm getting the better
Of things I thought I'd lose again

[Chorus:]
You know I wish I was your lover
Even if you dream of him
I wish I was your brother
Baby when you dream of him

If you dream of him?
If you dream of him

I'm sitting in graveyards
I'm doing the things that
I never thought I'd do again
I got in your backyard
I got so nervous
I never thought I'd breathe again

[Chorus]

Baby I need you
Baby I'm in love with you
I wish I was your lover
Even if you dream of him
(Oh if you dream, even if you dream of him
Oh if you dream, even if you dream of him)

[Chorus]

Baby I need you
Baby I'm in love with you
I wish I was your lover even if you dream of him
Even if you dream of him
