These days our problems seem to come in waves
Sometimes its hard to count them all
You're reading all alone when suddenly
You feel yourself about to fall

[Chorus:]
If you need someone to talk it out
Then talk it out with me
If you need someone to talk it out
Then I'm the one you need

Your fear of past mistakes intensifies
Your fear of everything that's new
You need a friend around to sympathise
Someone to help you with the view

[Chorus]

If you need someone to talk it out
To talk of what you see
If you need someone to talk it out
Then I'm the one you need

[Chorus]

Talk it out
Talk it out oh oh
I'm the one you need
