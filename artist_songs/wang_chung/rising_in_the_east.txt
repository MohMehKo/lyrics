Simple scenes that I've never seen
A hole in my living, a kind of in-between
A geisha girl, a hard won world
A wall that divides us from an eastern spell

So we're rising in the east

I've seen america, america
Where they're so tired of living, they don't walk alone
And my europeans, just do what they're told to do
That means me and you, me and you

So we're rising in the east
That's why we're rising in the east
