China, china, on the sea shore
China, china, on the dance floor
China, china, I must have seen your face before

I've been to cairo and I've been to khartoum
I've seen them places from my rented room
I've been to paris and I've been to marseille
But that was nothing till I got to cathay

I've been to new york and I've been to l.a.
I've been to delhi and I've been to bombay
I've been to venice and I've been to rome
But now it's peking that I think of as home

China, china, on the sea shore
China, china, on the dance floor
China, china, there's no finer place on earth

China, china, I must have seen your face before
