I wanna paint your portrait in bright color
I wanna paint the lines in red and blue
I wanna make your eyes appear like starlings
Saying, "Darling, I love you!"
I wanna set your face upon a landscape
I wanna show the love and toil and sweat
I wanna show your beauty like a crystal
In an all-night launderette

[Chorus:]
Oh this line is the flat horizon
And you are the shape on the left
Oh this line is the flat horizon
And this is the sun in the sky
Oh this line is the flat horizon
And makes the great divide
Between heaven and angels
And earth and men

I wanna show what lies beneath the surface
In little squares of purple, green and gold
So everyone can see their own reflection
In the mirror of your soul
I wanna paint your arrogance and beauty
I wanna paint the way you laugh at me
I wanna paint the world in which I see you
Fixed for all eternity

[Chorus]

I wanna paint your portrait in bright color
I wanna paint your personality
I wanna show the world just how I see you
I wanna show the world just how I see you
You know that only I can guarantee you
Precious immortality
Precious immortality

[Chorus]
