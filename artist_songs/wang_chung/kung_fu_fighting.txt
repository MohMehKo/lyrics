Everybody was stop, drop and rolling,
It all started by some lightning,
In fact it was a lil bit frightning,
How everybody was fire fighting,

There were funky firemen from funky fire town,
They were putting out the fires and they never let you down,
There was a fire in the hall, straight away they got the call,
They put the fire out before the trophys melt,

Everybody was stop, drop and rolling,
It all started by some lightning,
In fact it was a lil bit frightning,
How everybody was fire fighting,

About 100 people die, in one single year, 
They didn't drop & roll, they just sat and drank their beer,
If you catch on fire remember to stop, drop and roll,
Flames could hurt you and it may burn your soul,

Everybody was stop, drop and rolling,
It all started by some lightning,
In fact it was a lil bit frightning,
How everybody was fire fighting,

Everybody was stop, drop and rolling,
It all started by some lightning,
In fact it was a lil bit frightning,
How everybody was fire fighting,
