Living at speed
It's so hard, turns a year to days
The things that I need
It's so sad, but they will always change

So when you call my name
And the answer's not the same
Hold back the tears
The tears

Oh, it's raining
Though water's pouring down my face
There's no complaining

We must find another place

So when you're on your own
And you can't even telephone
Hold back the tears

I see your faces
I'll never see them again
The only traces
A single colour, you're in a frame
In a frame

So when you're on your own
Remember we're all alone
And hold back the tears
