Your dance hall days are over now
It's over now
It's over now

You're doing what you've chosen now
You've chosen now
You've chosen now

You work all day and save at night
You save at night
You save at night

You don't see your old friends
But you guess that we're alright
Guess we're alright
Guess we're alright

You and your boyfriend live on your own
And your boyfriend
You don't need your friends no more
You find all your friends a bore

You and your boyfriend live on your own
And your boyfriend
You don't need your friends no more
You find all your friends a bore

You plan to marry two years in June
Two years in June
Two years in June

It's a long time ahead, but it'll be here soon
It be here soon
It be here soon

So there's me and Lolita
And there's Jo-Jo of course
Judge your divorce
Judge your divorce

Will you still know our numbers
When you've got your divorce
Got your divorce
Got your divorce

You and your boyfriend live on your own
And your boyfriend
You don't need your friends no more
You find all your friends a bore

You and your boyfriend live on your own
And your boyfriend
You don't need your friends no more
You find all your friends a bore

When will you need our numbers?
When will you need our numbers?
When will you need our numbers?
When will you need our numbers?

You and your boyfriend live on your own
And your boyfriend
You don't need your friends no more
You find all your friends a bore

You and your boyfriend live on your own
And your boyfriend
You don't need your friends no more
You find all your friends a bore
