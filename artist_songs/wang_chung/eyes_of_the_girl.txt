On her televison, on her mamma's radio
She could paint a picture
More alive than all she ought to know
Her imagination running wild, she let it grow
In her imagination
Oh she felt she loved him so

[Chorus:]
The eyes of the girl are following me
Looking for the man that she pinned on me
The tears for a love that could never be
Now it's all over
They're raining on me
Oh it's raining

It's an empty world with a lifetime on your hands
Oh we must believe that
Something someone somewhere understands
Our imagination wants to capture what we feel
In our imagination
Everything is real

[Chorus]

Tears fall from the eyes of the girl
And the girl is watching me
Tears fall from the eyes of the girl
And the girl is watching me

Baby, please release me from the power of your mind
Baby, please release me, leave this crazy scheme behind
Baby, please release me
Baby, please release me

[Chorus]

Tears fall from the eyes of the girl
And the girl is watching me
