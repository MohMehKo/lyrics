It's hard to recall how we were at school
Our ambitions and conditions
And our hopes for the future
The teachers we had, our mums and our dads
Their decisions and revisions
And their hopes for the future

[Chorus:]
But look at me now
I cannot count the cost
Of all the friends I lost
And though my heart did break
Look at me now
I'm on the candle flame
I have a different name
I have your hand to take
But look at me now - and here I am

I used to believe in an idea received
With concision, but derision
Was my natural reaction
You cannot pretend that its all gonna end
In a second to be reckoned
Like a soldier in action

[Chorus]

Won't you look at me now
