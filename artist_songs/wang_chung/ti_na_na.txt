You're sending messages to me girl
I feel them flashed across the land
It's such that I can disbelieve girl
And what you feel is in my hand

[Chorus:]
Ti na na, ti na na ne girl
Ti na na, ti na na ne
Ti na na, ti na na ne girl
Ti na na, ti na na ne

It's cold outside, I can't breathe girl
Without a pain inside my heart
And if I should ever leave girl
And even then without a start

So I'm sitting by the fireside
Or on the beach or some hotel
And I feel like sitting down and crying
I sing the words I know so well

[Chorus]
