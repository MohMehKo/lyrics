It's 10 o'clock
You're still awake
So many things to think about
Your miserable life ey?

Come with me [x3]
Come with me for a moment
Come with me [x3]
Come with me, come with me and

Tonight like birds we will fly
We'll leave our burden on our nest
Of hate, of pain, of bitterness and
Tonight like angels we will fly
We'll touch the clouds, we'll paint the sky
And use your favourite colors

It's half past two
Your eyes won't sleep
The lies that haunted you won't rest
Until you give in

Come with me [x3]
Come with me for a moment
Come with me [x3]
Come with me, come with me and

Tonight like birds we will fly
We'll leave our burden on our nest
Of hate, of pain, of bitterness and
Tonight like angels we will fly
We'll touch the clouds, we'll paint the sky
And use your favourite colors

Tonight
Like birds we will fly
We'll leave our burden on our nest
Of hate, of pain, of bitterness

Tonight
Like birds we will fly
We'll touch the clouds, we'll paint the sky
And use your favourite colors

For tonight
