Hey are you tired of all the sorrows in life
Hey are you down don't have any more tears to cry
Don't be scared close your eyes and see
Dream away through the night and make those fantasies come to life
Fly high in the sky enjoy the stars as they shine on you

Bye, escape from life, bye, escape from life

The moon shines up high she can seem to understand
The pain that you feel will soon go away
Don't despair close your eyes and feel
Dream away through the night and make your fantasies come to life
Fly high in the sky enjoy the stars as they shine on you

Dream away through the night and make your fantasies come to life
Fly high in the sky enjoy the stars as they shine on you
Dream away through the night and make your fantasies come to life
Fly high in the sky enjoy the stars as they shine on you
Feel those dreams they will come true
Soar high in the heavens above
Lay your head the pain will go away
