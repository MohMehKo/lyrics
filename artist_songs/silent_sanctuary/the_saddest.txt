I hate seeing you looking down
A beautiful face wear a frown
Look up so I can see
Look up so I can see

Hold still enjoy your pace
With time a picture will fade
Look up so I can see
Look up so I can see

With melancholic symmetry
Of second movements
In symphony

A million fireflies on a tree
You burn, you burn the brightest for me

Your eyes speak the saddest lines
A poet could write
You give me a chance to make them smile

Look up so I can see
Look up so I can see
