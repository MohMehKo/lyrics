Well I see you standing there
Clouds covered from the moon
Strong wind blows through my hair
It's midnight and I'm staying here
It's so dark and cold
And I need you
For holding me
My heart desire: you

Well I wish you were here
And I see you everywhere
You are a vision from my heart
But I stand apart
It's a long time ago
Since I first saw you
I've been waiting, waiting, waiting
Many years for you

I need you - for holding me
I need you for holding me
My heart desire: you tonight

Oh I see you standing there
Clouds covered from the moon
Strong wind blows through my hair
It's midnight and I'm staying here
It's so dark and cold
And I need you
For holding me
My heart desire: you

I need you for holding me
I need you for holding, for holding me

Oh I wish you were here
And I see you everywhere
You are a vision from my heart
But I stand apart
It's so dark and cold
And I need you
For holding me
My heart desire: you

I need you - for holding me
I need you for holding me
My heart desire: you tonight

I need you for holding, for holding me
Oh yes I need you for holding me
My heart desire: you tonight
