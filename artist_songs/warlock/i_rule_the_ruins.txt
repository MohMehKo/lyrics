There's a tattooed symbol underneath my sleeve
An iron glove over a hand of steel
You can't touch me
Don't touch me

All for one and one for me
Listen well and I'll set you free
You can trust me
For eternity

No promise
Is honest
In a world of change

I rule the ruins with passion and pain
I rule the ruins
Sinner or saint
Fortune or fate

Alive and well in this livin' hell
I survived it all, now it's time to tell
Can you hear me
Do you hear me

Once a tattered soul on bended knees
With one hand to God, I felt the devil's breeze
I begged help me
Won't you rescue me

One promise dishonest
And everything will change

[CHORUS]

There's a tattooed symbol underneath my sleeve
Iron glove over a hand of steel
I rule the ruins
I rule the ruins

I rule the ruins
With passion and pain
I rule the ruins
Sinner and saint
I rule the ruins

[REPEAT & FADE]
