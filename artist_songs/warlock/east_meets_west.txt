Killing time
Watching signs
I'm waitin'
See on the other side of town
I've seen the walls come tumblin' down
So I've come here to make you shake

So get up get up, get up get up
Oh come on, come on,
come on why don't you come on

[CHORUS]

When East meets West
There's gonna be one hell of a mess
When East meets West
There's gonna be one hell of a mess
When East meets West

There's a finger on the trigger of a very troubled mind
Working for the love of Satan
There's no blisters on his fingers
There's no blood on his clothes
But I've seen the world that he's been makin'

So get up, get up, get up, get up
Oh come on, come on, come on, why don't you come on

[CHORUS]

When East meets West
There's gonna be one hell of a mess
When East meets West
There's gonna be one hell of a mess
When East meets West

So get up, get up, get up, get up
Oh come on, come on, come on

When East meets West
There's gonna be one hell of a mess
When East meets West
There's gonna be one hell of a mess
When East meets West

When East meets West
There's gonna be one hell of a mess
When East meets West
There's gonna be one hell of a mess
When East meets West
