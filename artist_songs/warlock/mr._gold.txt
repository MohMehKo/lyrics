See the master of evil
Diamonds in his eyes
Finger-tips like a needle
Stab you from behind

He'll pay any price
To buy your heart and soul
He makes a deal with heaven
All he wants is your life

No mercy for Mr. Gold !
No mercy don't shake hands With the devil
Dreams are not for sale !

He bleeds you white
To kill your dignity
He makes a deal with heaven
All he wants is your life !

No mercy for Mr. Gold !
Dreams are not for sale
No mer-cy
No mercy for Mr. Gold !
Dreams are not for sale
Ne's a stranger !
Stranger in my world
See the master of evil
Diamonds in his eyes
Fingertips like a needle
Stab you from behind

He'll pay any price
To buy your heart and soul
He makes a deal with heaven
All he wants is your life
To cut another slice !
