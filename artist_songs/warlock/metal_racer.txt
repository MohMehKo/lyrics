Racing down on the motorway
No rest, no place to stay
He calls it running out of time

Got no place in society
Forever fought the Philistines
He forever walked upon his line

Outside of the law
An eternal war
No-one can hold him back
Ready to attack

He's a damned - racing through the night
He's a damned - will never see the light
He's a damned - darkness in his eyes
He's a damned - but metal racer never dies

Don't care what other people say
Be what you are, take the hotter way
Don't be a madman, don't give up

Take this heavy sound into your brain
So it's easier to break the chain
'Cause heavy metal knows no stop

Outside of the law
An eternal war
No-one can hold him back
Ready to attack

He's a damned - racing through the night
He's a damned - will never see the light
He's a damned - darkness in his eyes
He's a damned - but metal racer never dies

He's a damned - racing through the night
He's a damned - will never see the light
He's a damned - darkness in his eyes
He's a damned - but metal racer never dies

He's racing down the motorway
No rest, no place to stay
He calls it running out of time

Got no place in society
Forever fought against the Philistines
Forever walked upon his line

Outside of the law
An eternal war
No-one can hold him back
Ready to attack

He's a damned - racing through the night
He's a damned - will never see the light
He's a damned - darkness in his eyes
He's a damned - but metal racer never gonna die!
