It's a long long way down
To the dark side we're bound
Tattered and torn
We're wasted and worn

It's a long, long, long, long, long way down
I've been lonely
I'm lonely too lonely
It makes me so mad
I could just swear ? I swear ...

It's a cold, cold, cold world
It's a cold, cold, cold world
It's a cold, cold, cold world

It's the wrong time I don't belong in
The wrong time
Oh, no, cause the wrong time leaves a long, long
Time to sleep

One bite
And I'll be standing here dead right
Oh - with a long, long, long, long time to dream

And I've been lonely, lonely I'm lonely - too long
It makes me so mad
I could just swear, I swear
It's a cold, cold world
It's a cold, cold world
It's a cold, cold world
Cold

It's a cold, cold world
It's a cold, cold world
It's a cold, cold world
It's a cold, cold world
Cold, cold
