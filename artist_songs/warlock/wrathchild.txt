Just beyond the neonlights
Where the city is full of rats
It's a neverending fight
Between good 'n' evil
You must be strong
Or you will die

You've got the guts
And got the power
To break out -
So you ain't running

This is your story
It's all about you
Yeah it's all about you
- Wrathchild
You beat up everyone in your way
- Never satisfied
With a wall all around you

But you ain't gonna lose
'Cause you're the one
( Who can ) break the chains
You ain't gonna lose
'Cause you're the one
To run through hell and flames
