Fear in the night
Broken dreams - wrapped in starlight
Our love is dead

I cannot feel my mind
I cannot feel who's wrong or right

It's you or me
The strategy we know oh so well
The battle field lies deep down in our hearts
It's cold as hell
No compromise
We burn the last bridges down

Do you feel allright
We're drowning in blood sweat and tears
When love turns to fear.

We gonna shoot it out
Between you and me
When hearts turn to stone !
Love's in the danger zone

Stiletto heels
Run for your life
Shoot me down in flames
Kill my alibis
When we're talking every word
Is an act of war

When I call out your name in the night
I hear the sound of the master's voice.
