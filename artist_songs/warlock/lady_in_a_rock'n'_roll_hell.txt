Take me down
I'm ready for another ride underground
I need your love
Baby to take me down

Snake in the grass
A 'good good girl
I am the queen of the night
I need a man of action
Ready to set me free

Take me down
Where solar fires shake the ground
Take me down
To solid walls of sound

I'm a lady in a rock'n'roll hell
I'm a lady under a spell
I'm a lady in a rock 'n' roll hell
A lady !
Rockin' angel under a spell

Music and lights
My kiss is fire and ice
My body and soul
Are chains for eternity

I need a man
A rock of steel
No 'blue jean baby' at my chariot wheel
I need a man of action
Ready to set me free

Take me down
Where solar fires shake the ground
Take me down
To solid walls of sound
