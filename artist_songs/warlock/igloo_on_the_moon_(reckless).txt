Life can be good
Life can be bad
Sometimes our mind is floating
A sea of doubt
A number 1
Right off the track
Sometimes it all hangs by a thread

But I know people
With a different point of view
Blue card-board heroes
With bad luck in their shoes
I'm telling you
You better run for home
Go keep your distance
Get back where you belong !

[BRIDGE:]
Oh you can build an igloo on the moon
Go to the pyramids and book a tomb
We're better off without you here
So go away - and shed all your tears

[REF:]
Because I'm Reckless
Ready to go
A touch of lightning
From my head to my toes
Reckless
Live your life
Before the moment dies

The tender hooks of agony
Stuck like a poison arrow deep
Inside your heart
It hurts so good
To feel so sad
Oh lay down you're better off dead
