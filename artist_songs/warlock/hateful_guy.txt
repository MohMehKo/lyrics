Aah!

You're in a fever for the next bloody deed
Your search is not long, your search for all what you need
Your body wild - what's going on in your head?
Oh we all know that you're a man so bad

Like what it is
All that you missed, you missed
When you take it in your hand
It means it is... its end

All what you find and when it's even a child
Believe that you're a friend, and not a guy
You can't be quiet till you make it sad
That's what you need before you can't, going mad

Don't care what it is
All what you missed, you missed
When you take it in your hand
It means it is its end
Yeah... yeah...
You're a hateful guy
You're hateful
Hateful when you arrive
All of us, we're content
Until you make us cry
