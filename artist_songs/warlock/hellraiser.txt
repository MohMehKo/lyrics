Flesh and bones
With hearts of stone
ainted face
Has lost its place
Beneath the wheel
No pain can heal
The spirit must learn how to fly
Across the clouds
Strong and proud

So rise up - forget about the stories you tell
Rise up - and let me hear your renegade heart yell

Oh, oh, oh, oh Rock on Hellraiser
Oh, oh, oh, oh Raze it Hellraiser

Stand or fall
Don't we all
Searchin' for ways to survive
We're sweatin' blood
To keep alive

And if you feel
What I feel
Then we will learn how to fight
For what is real
And what is right

So rise up - forget about the stories you tell
Rise up - and let me hear your renegade heart yell

Oh, oh, oh, oh Rock on Hellraiser
Oh, oh, oh, oh Raze it Hellraiser

So rise up - forget about the stories you tell
Rise up - and let me hear your renegade heart yell

Oh, oh, oh, oh Rock on Hellraiser
Oh, oh, oh, oh Raze it Hellraiser
Oh, oh, oh, oh Rock on Hellraiser
Oh, oh, oh, oh Raze it Hellraiser
Oh, oh, oh, oh Rock on Hellraiser
Oh, oh, oh, oh Raze it Hellraiser
Oh, oh, oh, oh Rock on Hellraiser
Oh, oh, oh, oh Raze it Hellraiser...
