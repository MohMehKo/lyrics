The biggest war has ended
The smoke gets away
The sun is coming up
To salute the horrible day

An endless battlefield
Overcrowded with death
Ah there's no-one there
Who could have been blessed

No singing of a bird
Rustle of a tree
And all is carried off
All is carried off

For a few merciless creatures
The war is a game
And all the time
They want to play it for gain

Ooh the war has ended

No singing of a bird
Rustle of a tree
And all is carried off
All is carried off

It is all over
Life was in vain
All that had seemed important
Didn't reveal its aim

War has ended

No singing of a bird
Rustle of a tree
And all is carried off
All is carried off
