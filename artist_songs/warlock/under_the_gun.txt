Tell me no secrets and I'll tell you no lies
The future has been twisted and rehearsed for its demise
The warning lights are flashin' and they're circlin' in the sky
But no one feels the sinner's blow it's right before their eyes

The wicked watch their heroes with evil on their minds
While reaching out for heaven's gate, their shots ring through the night
Hellbent for thunder we are racin' with the time
But no one knows which way to go and no one knows to try

5 million reasons with 10 million pieces to go
Wheelers and dealers with nothin' but dreams of control
I believe, we're under the gun
I believe, we're under the gun
Sold out to madness
Prisoners of sadness
I believe we're under the gun
We're under the gun

In the land of milk and money the devil has his spies
While workin' undercover they all keep a watchful eye
They're building up the underworld, they're rotten to the bone
And crossin' out the others, while they're sellin' out their own

5 million reasons and 10 million pieces to go
Wheelers and dealers with nothin' but dreams of control
I believe we're under the gun
I believe we're under the gun
Sold out to madness
Prisoners of sadness
Oh I believe we're under the gun
We're under the gun

5 million reasons with 10 million pieces to go
Wheelers and dealers with nothin' but dreams of control
I believe we're under the gun
I believe we're under the gun
Sold out to madness
Prisoners of sadness
Sold out to madness
Prisoners of sadness
I believe we're under the gun
