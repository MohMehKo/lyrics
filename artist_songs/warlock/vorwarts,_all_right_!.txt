I am on the loose
I am lying in wait
The hunter the prey
I was begging for quarter
Now I sing a different tune

I won't eat your humble pie
You won't make me toe the line anymore
Now that I'm free
And I'm running forever !

Runaway
Capture that runaway !
Vorwaerts allright

Runaway
Capture that runaway !
Vorwaerts all right

Flyin' I'm flying I'm flying

You can count me out
I will never say die
I'm leaving today

Cover up my tracks
No I won't be found
I'll stay in the shade

Take a chance and don't think twice
You won't me make me toe the line anymore
Now that I'm free
I'm running forever !

Vorwarts Vorwarts Vorwarts all right !
Vorwaerts ! Capture that runaway !
Capture that runaway !
Capture that runaway !
