See my soul as desire
Catch the words as they fall from my lips
Feel the passion grow higher
Lick the sweat from my fingertips

Be my love
Beware my love is strange
Be my love
Beware the time can change

See my scars heat the hunter
Catch the thoughts as they race with the wind
Hear my heart beat like thunder
Free yourself, let the madness begin

Be my love
Beware my love is strange
Be my love
Beware the time can change

We're Angels With Dirty Faces
Livin' all alone
Angels With Dirty Faces
So far from home
Our dirty minds go on and on
Our fear of night is long gone
We're Angels With Dirty Faces
So far from home

Touch my skin
It's on fire
Light your dreams with the heat of the sun

Let your passions expire
Burn it up till there's nowhere to run

Be my love
Beware my love is strange
Be my love
Beware the times have changed

We're Angels With Dirty Faces
Livin' all alone
Angels With Dirty Faces
So far from home
Our dirty minds go on and on
Our fear of night is long gone
We're Angels With Dirty Faces
So far from home
So far from home

Be my love
Beware my love is strange
Be my love
Beware the times have changed

We're Angels With Dirty Faces
Livin' all alone
Angels With Dirty Faces
So far from home
Our dirty minds go on and on
Our fear of night is long gone
We're Angels With Dirty Faces
So far from home
So far from home
So far from home
So far from home
So far from home
