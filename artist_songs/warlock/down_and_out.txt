Hey, guy
It's not in order
To walk around like the lads
'Cause for people of my age
You're a stranger
You're from a distant scene

Like a fox in a cage
Like a junkie without H
And I can clearly make out
You don't have no clue
I'd rather forget you
Don't know what my life's all about.

And you run and run and run
You can't get away
You just try to escape
From your age I'm afraid
pretending to be young.

You can't get it done
Down and out, you're a bum
You can't get it done
Down and out, you're a loser

When you start to explain
That you did it just for me
I tell you straight: "Too far out !"
Forget all your fears
Cry out all your tears
It's the only chance to save your soul

And you run and run and run
But can't get away
You just try to escape
From your age, I'm afraid
You're just insane
You can't get it done
