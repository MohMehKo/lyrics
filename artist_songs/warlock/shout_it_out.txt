Get away and start all over
Think about your own
Destination
Maybe you have to try
When time is right for you
Ah, you ain't gonna find a way
To make it all better
But leave the evil nightmare
Now and forever
Hear the sound of music
Feel the night is so remote

So pave the way for
Pave the way for
What you wanna do
So do it
What you wanna do
So go and do it
Try to find your destination
Things can get you so high
When you know what's life
Then you can't get enough

Shout it out (what you want)
Never say die
Shout it out (to feel good)
Never
Show the others
When you boil with rage
You wanna destroy
The narrow minded fuss
About nothing
About nothing

They didn't accept
They didn't expect
They wonder why
There's only destruction
On your mind
Your mind
