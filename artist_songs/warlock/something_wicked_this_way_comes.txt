Every night
I have the strangest dreams
Runnin' through my head
And every night
I have the strangest feelin'
I ain't in my bed

It's always the same
But I can't explain
I'm feeling no pain
Then I'm alone again

I pull the trigger
And I'm the bullet
Comin' out of the gun

[CHORUS]

Something wicked this way comes
Something wicked this way comes

Darkness came
And I gave my heart again
And that's forever
It was love and pain
I'll never be the same
But I can't surrender

Don't know what it is
I'm feelin' stranger and stranger
I live in my dreams
And I am feelin' danger

I'm feelin' cold
Somebody help me, 'cause you stole
My heart forever

[CHORUS]

Something wicked this way comes
Something wicked this way comes

Somebody help me
Make it throught the night
Somebody save me
'Cause somethin' ain't right
Things ain't what they seem
Can't wake up from this dream
