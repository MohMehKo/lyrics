Outside this flamin' ring of fire
There's nothing left for me to lose
I shoot to kill if I desire
I walk away if I so choose

4,000 filthy stinkin' liars
Tell me there's nothin' I can do
I don't forget, I don't grow tired
Someday I'll do the same to you

Alles klar bad is good
You better listen till it's understood

There's a touch of evil - in my mind
There's a touch of evil - in these eyes
There's a touch of evil
There's a touch of evil
This time - a touch of evil

There's a fever floatin' round my brain
So many things I can't explain
You better listen, better get it into your head
No regrets for anything I've said

Alles klar bad is good
I'm gonna tell you till it's understood

[CHORUS]

A touch of evil
In my mind
A touch of evil

Alles klar, alles good
Now I'm here in your neighborhood

There's a touch of evil in my mind
There's a touch of evil in these eyes
There's a touch of evil
There's a touch of evil

There's a touch of evil in my mind
There's a touch of evil in these eyes
There's a touch of evil in my mind
There's a touch of evil in these eyes

A touch of evil in my mind
A touch of evil in these eyes

A touch of evil ...
