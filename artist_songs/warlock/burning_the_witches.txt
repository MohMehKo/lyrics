When the day is over
The devil is near
The people who know it
Are full of fear

When the devil is coming
A virgin will die
A soldier of the darkness
Will take her life

The demon takes the body
Of the bloodless gal
Outside she's looking pretty
Inside a beast of hell

That's what you are callin'
A hellcat or a witch
And only if she's burning
The demon will die

Burning the witches
The evil cries
By burning the witches
The demon dies
By burning the witches
The demon dies by fire

The witches are hunting
Your soul and your blood
And if you can't escape
They take all that you've got

A soul of the virgin
Can find no peace
Till the fire is killing
The witch - they can be free

Burning the witches
The evil cries
By burning the witches
The demon dies
By burning the witches
The evil cries by fire!

By burning the witches
The demon dies
By burning the witches
The evil cries
By burning the witches
The demon dies
By burning the witches
The evil cries
By burning...
