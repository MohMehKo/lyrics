Restless I close my eyes
Can't sleep at all
Think about my million lies
And think about my life

When darkness takes over
I believe in damnation
Nobody knows my dreams
My fears and all my pain

( Die in the night )
I feel the pain tonight
Blood in my eyes

Under the curse
Under the bad curse of nightmares

Tonight it's time to die
The shadows take me
To the damned in the darkness
Tonight it's time to die
All my nightmares will come true

Into the darkness
I'm falling with fear
Unholy faces come near

I feel the pain tonight
Blood in my eyes

Under the curse
Under the bad curse of nightmares

Then I am discerning the face of death
Who was always a good friend
Kissing the death
I'm bound to loose my senses
I feel it's over now
Surrendering to him
It's over now
