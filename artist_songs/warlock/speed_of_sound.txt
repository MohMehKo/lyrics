Hey pull the trigger
I am your bullet
Going to nowhere
I'm shooting up into the sky

The rhythm
Accelerator
This rocket is ready to fly

Goodbye to your slow-creeping days
Nothing will stand in my way!

Racing faster
Breaking out of this mad prison-cell
Faster
Just like a flash out to hell

Ah speed of sound metal heat !
Atomic speed set me free
Speed of sound treat me right
Sonic speed set me free

Red blood and gasoline
We really got to go
This rat-race is getting us down

Child of the rhythm
Don't wait forever
Tonight is the night!

Racing faster
Breakin' out of this mad prison-cell
Faster
Just like a flash out of hell

Speed of sound, metal heat !
Sonic speed set me free
Speed of sound treat me right
Just as fast as the speed of light !

Speed of sound, metal heat !
Sonic speed set me free
Speed of sound metal heat !
Can't you see how i feel

Atomic speed ! Set me free ! Speed of sound !
Just as fast as the speed of light !
