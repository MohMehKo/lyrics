[Hook:]
You know God
But since you keep frontin won't you give that man a call, call, call
Hand on my grip, came off the hit
Don't be acting where it's for leave that at the floor
Knock knock knocking on heavens door
Knock knock knocking on heavens door
Knock knock knocking on heavens door
Knock knock knocking on heavens door

[Verse 1:]
I came in the shit already turked the fuck up
So fucking purpose to get this turn the fuck up
And if you like me let's get this turd to fuck up
And if you feel away I dare you step the fuck up
And now I point this at you and knock your head the fuck off
BSB the best out the rest of y'all can fuck off
You kissing on that bitch and that's my dick she just sucked off
You blowin off her phone, I'm blowin off her dome
You suck it up and fuck it up and her breath is my simone
I'm dead right and you're dead wrong
If I'm dead wrong then you dead on
I'm known for letting this let on
I'm better off and I'm better in
You nigga search me medicine
I pop up at your residence
I came for the money and president
My chop like this I'm president
Brooklyn I'm taking up the kid
'Cause we ain't got hotter then the devils did
If you think it's totally shit till their neck can spit
You know their phone till they're on till their neck is bit
So a nigga can smoke as a negligent
Big block on a nigga that's heaven sent

[Hook:]
You know God
But since you keep frontin won't you give that man a call, call, call
Hand on my grip, came off the hit
Don't be acting where it's for leave that at the floor
Knock knock knocking on heavens door
Knock knock knocking on heavens door
Knock knock knocking on heavens door
Knock knock knocking on heavens door

[Verse 2:]
I'm sick of niggas trying, sick of niggas lying
Get 'em off the network, Conan O'Brien
Nigga what's your net worth talking like you flip work
What you know about have the freezer in your house
I'm a sit up on your couch cook about an ounce
Say quick you had your spouse if you ever find out
Crack on sucker mouth, crack around the kids
She ain't with that shit and you givin 0 fucks
Ain't really with that bitch I'm a working crack dealing
Get pilling type of nigga, A told me to rap
So the counters small figures benz be the tenth
Put them niggas out them triggers fuck this rap shit
Don't care about burning bridges
I clap anybody who scheme for my riches
I got dough deals
But dope deals and these other dope deals that broke I won't fail
Be careful what the words are only for broke still

[Hook:]
You know God
But since you keep frontin won't you give that man a call, call, call
Hand on my grip, came off the hit
Don't be acting where it's for leave that at the floor
Knock knock knocking on heavens door
Knock knock knocking on heavens door
Knock knock knocking on heavens door
Knock knock knocking on heavens door
