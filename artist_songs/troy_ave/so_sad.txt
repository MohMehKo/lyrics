[Hook:]
I really thought we could've work it out
Even gave up the bitter bitter doubt
But we can't stop playing around
Didn't I still do what I do now
Sometimes I wish that we can get it back
Because everyone deserves a second chance
But we can never go back like that
It's a shame how good things can't come back
Too bad, too bad
It's so sad
Too bad, look at all that we could've had
Just too bad

[Verse 1:]
Now how the fuck could I forget her
Truthful when I met her
She was gonna be Ms. Sevin
But I wasn't gonna sweat her
From waking up textin her
For wakin up next to her
Rollin over fucking having unprotected sex with her
Thinking sitting down when I was still running wild
Then she hit me with the news she about to have my child
I fell back and I was wrong I ain't gonna front
But days turned into weeks, then weeks turned into months
Came to my senses tried to be more supportive
Then she looked me in the eye and said that baby got aborted
Now I'm trying to get her close to me
And she trying to get over me
And we don't even speak damn this ain't how it supposed to be

It's a shame how good things can't come back
Too bad, too bad
It's so sad
Too bad, look at all that we could've had
Just too bad

[Verse 2:]
Alright I cheated, I admit it I cheated
But not with nobody that I really wanted to be with
And you was doing your thing too that ain't a secret
Girl when I gave you my heart you were supposed to keep it
But instead you gave it back, now you got me like a maniac
I got alot of women but I want my baby back
See I still can't accept you're gone
And when the world got cold girl you kept me warm
Now I'm getting drunk missing you thinking about dissing you
Pissed at the fact I no longer mean shit to you
Not only a lover I lost a friend
But if you took me back shit I'd probably do it again
