[Hook:]
I wanna say thanks to my pot
Now is Benjamin Franks in my lot
I wanna say thanks to my Glock
And RIP to the niggas that I shot
I wanna give thanks to my block
Still fuck put the money in the stocks
It's 33 shots in them all
We screaming fuck you to the cops

[Verse 1:]
First of all, I wanna thank God and my pot
Hold up, ain't money can call up for this pot
I smoke this, I smoke niggas, they deserve to get shot
I don't start shit, I depart shit, they deserve what they got
They deserve to get rot, Rock deserved to get chop
Put a right skate on an ice plate, I'm eating well of this block
Fat boy with this stacks, Troy, actor is a mad coil
Ask me and I don't fuck with you, I fuck with bitches that fuck with you
And lead me to your whereabouts, I creep through and I air you out
Ghost points are hard to ripple, threw his neck just goes with it
Y'all think this a damn song but it's real life, I'm hands on
Other niggas ain't of it, they rap about it, I does it
I'm selling coke in the public, out of town meet me out public
In a frozen hour that frozen fish, hand shake for my frozen wrist
Cool swag for a dope man, cold heart that don't change
Fur on, my bird's gone, I'm Brooklyn's new cocaine powder

[Hook:]
I wanna say thanks to my pot
Now is Benjamin Franks in my lot
I wanna say thanks to my Glock
And RIP to the niggas that I shot
I wanna give thanks to my block
Still fuck put the money in the stocks
It's 33 shots in them all
We screaming fuck you to the cops

[Verse 2:]
I wanna say thanks to my pow racks
That baking soda helped me with the progress
I may fit to your axe in the projects
The hood still talking about my rep
I done shot niggas over truck teams
'Cause niggas didn't see her when her looks came
I talk money, niggas run game
Where I'm from they only respecting the gun game
Remember when I used to drive a Regal
Now I'm paying for your rights for an Eagle
It's 8 big bullets in this Eagle,
It's leaving niggas curled up in the field
I carry a topple like a handgun
I hear your baby mama pay your ransom
The coke and the pot and it's dancing
I hope all your kids catch cancer

[Hook:]
I wanna say thanks to my pot
Now is Benjamin Franks in my lot
I wanna say thanks to my Glock
And RIP to the niggas that I shot
I wanna give thanks to my block
Still fuck put the money in the stocks
It's 33 shots in them all
We screaming fuck you to the cops
