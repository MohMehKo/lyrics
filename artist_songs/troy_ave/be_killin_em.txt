[Hook:]
Ye what the fuck bro
You got a dutch, so
Where the weed at, nigga you with that
You tryin to pay up you need to man up
Get your own stop lookin with your hand out
I don't like no begging ass nigga don't like no begging ass bitch
I don't like no begging ass nigga don't like no begging ass bitch

[Verse:]
I hate when niggas ask me the price
I tell 'em to turn around and try to ask me twice
Stupid, you know you're playing with your life
Streets ain't a game and these sus nigga psych
I pop glass niggas green can't trash niggas
Get it how I live 'cause handouts for ass niggas
Ass niggas I am not a rap nigga
I will black put your brain on your fucking lap nigga
I'm doing laps around the town everytime it ring
Bring jar here just in case you gotta sing
You want some from Mav had the cash for you
Or you will see me nigga I blast for you
Don't blame me nigga you're the one that asked for it
Instead of building up your ass try the fast forward
You dumb fuck you're out of your damn luck
If the sun can't eat my nigga then so what

[Hook:]
Ye what the fuck bro
You got a dutch, so
Where the weed at, nigga you with that
You tryin to pay up you need to man up
Get your own stop lookin with your hand out
I don't like no begging ass nigga don't like no begging ass bitch
I don't like no begging ass nigga don't like no begging ass bitch
