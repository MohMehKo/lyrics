[Verse 1:]
All the feds ran up the ray
My room before you came
Acused me of cocaine distribution off those damn knees
Niggas they tell low in you too day time short
My eyes don't shed tears I'm a kill all them
I'm thinking about who
Gonna die bye bye
I'm just thinking about who
Gonna die bye bye
I'm just thinking about who
Who it is that uhmm,
I'm a kill with my ruger, uh ye

[Hook:]
They ain't found shit so far
Ain't nothing else 'cause I know better
And they ain't found shit in my clothes
'Cause I kept everything safe

[Verse 2:]
I really like you and I thought you were cool and oftenly kicking
When I leavin you be all up inside my phone,
Never said I loved you I just thought you was cute till I saw issues
That chance while you think I'm a chase and hoes I'm lying down
Picking you through, but you don't know so don't
I ain't fucking with you, but you don't know so don't
I ain't fucking with you, bet you think about them still
Do you, do you

[Hook:]
They ain't found shit so far
Ain't nothing else 'cause I know better
And they ain't found shit in my clothes
'Cause I kept everything safe

[Verse 3:]
I remember how could I forget how you feel
You know you were my first girl, a new feel
And it don't ever get older at the soul of it
We can keep a low fire
Rocks is getting sold to people over colors you know black and white

[Hook:]
They ain't found shit so far
Ain't nothing else 'cause I know better
And they ain't found shit in my clothes
'Cause I kept everything safe
