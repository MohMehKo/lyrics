Hun'eds, hun'eds in my pocket, keep it G
All day, everyday, real life, this is me
Got the streets on lock, you ain't blind, you can see
Your boy Troy Ave and the Kid Capri

[Hook - Kid Capri:]
She said that she don't want me cause I'm just another dealer
Heard some niggas overtalkin' and they said I was a killer
Plus you know I come from Brooklyn and she way up in the Bronx
I said, 'Baby, fuck you mean? I ride front, want you want?'

Ay, yo, I met her in Astoria, stage name Gloria
Smooth skin, tanned like a vacay in Florida
She don't want to dance, she just tryin' to bring the dough though
I went in my pants, couple bands, that's for all of you
Bitches wit' ambition, he just in the kitchen
Him bein' me, dark skin, juice glistenin', right?
And, baby, this your lucky night
Fuck wit' the Kid, roll wit' me like a pair of dice
Trips, see low clouds on the plane
So fly, so high, take a hit of Mary Jane
It's a PJ, it just came from VA
Hampton University, seven plus three K
That's a dime, you a dime, I shine, you could shine
Them other niggas want chores, I just want you to be mind
You sip birthday cake wine, I'm a part of that
I could show you where love and the dollars at

[Hook - Kid Capri:]
She said that she don't want me cause I'm just another dealer
Heard some niggas overtalkin' and they said I was a killer
Plus you know I come from Brooklyn and she way up in the Bronx
I said, 'Baby, fuck you mean? I ride front, want you want?'

[Verse 2: Troy Ave]
Party dumb, more fun, still kickin' game
It's really just extra, she already know the name
You spoke my peace, out the door, capisce
Hit the alarm, doors open, nah, I don't lease
Paid in full, new bands, baby, fuck your friends
Them hoes'd leave you if they could get wit' me
And I don't really want people in my business
Whether it's streets or the sheets, that's how you get a sentence
I'm a give you time, be careful how you spend it
Whole lot to comes, I base her and no penny
Batter up, little bitch bad as fuck
You made a good choice, let me snatch her up
They say one loyal girl is hard to find
So when you get her, keep her wit' it, to the top you come
Rocky road, rock and roll, heavy metal for [?]
They don't want to step up and shine, motherfuckers

[Hook - Kid Capri:]
