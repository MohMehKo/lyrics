[Verse 1:]
Dope dealin niggas is the pellicle
And I'm known to smoke it louder do
It's BSB, who the fuck is you?
My whole clique known to touch the two
Niggas want beef I turn em vegetable
Please know who you steppin to
I hear you talk, go on, wutchu waitin for?
I swear I'm ready for the day we quirl
And I'm the one to prove your curtains due
And you don't wanna get your curtains pulled
Just know that everything I say be truth
I'm one of the illest of my illie crew
I love a bitch that's so beautiful
That bitch is looking, say she beautiful
And she be lovin what us dealers do
And take a pardon all our meanest acts
As I sip on this red cup
The Lord as my witness, I keep it super cool
It's always R&S'in
It's a shame that's some Fubu's
Go cokamania and get Chiddy Bang
This the loud the drugs in the gang but powder sells the best

[Verse 2:]
Uh, alright alright
Everything I've got in this world I owe to my mama and coke
Shouts to Brooklyn and good lookin bitches who travel with dope boys
BSB, boy no more
Ya'll getting money nigga
Fuckin bitches too, my cologne's my signature
Clear up on the spot, jean polo boy
A nigga only fit God and the gabbles from the court
Preacher wearin black, judge wearin black
Haters weighin hoes from the shots out my strap
And I don't wanna rap, I just do it for the hustle
I'm paper chasin and it's the quickest way to get em off you
Them meaning them people, them 3 letter evils
All the dirt that I done did, I know that I'm owed the needle, damn

[Verse 3:]
This thing the movement, is more of a mentality
Go against it if you choose and it's gon be some fatalities
Get down or lay down,
You lay down? Then stay down
Loyalty ain't a game and this ain't no fuckin playground
Stayin sucka free and being real with my crew
I'd ide for them niggas and I'd kill for em too
Cross my team once, it won't be no round two
We put it down in the town, we did not fuckin around crew
And we really not fuckin around too
Your body parts will get fell dude
100 shot to surround you
Hitting you and all them niggas that surround you
