[Hook:]
I said it's 5 in the morning
You know where we're going
Back to the crib so we can get it on
(She ready babe)
I hope that you're ready baby
(I know she just met me)
I know that you just met me baby
And don't be puttin up a front
You know what I want
Tell your girls you're leaving I'll be waiting out front
(Just be ready babe)
She sayin she ready
(I just hope that you ready babe)
I know you just met me babe

[Verse 1:]
We go straight from the benz to that bottle service
Fuck the charge brick star boys getting in
We all strapped nigga it's whatever's necessary
My whole section looking like a pet cemetery
Bottle after bottle to the face no coasters
Model after model blowing huco on the sofas
52 tattoos attitude is mad rule
Acting all fly like she ain't talking to that dude
Grabbed her by the waist of my direction
Bitches love a young fly nigga with aggression
Whispered in her ear, here's my confession
I rather see you walking through my crib undressing
She smiled thought about it for a while
Then reach for my phone for her number I could dial
Told her slow it down too many people in our faces
Let's get up out of here we'll exchange them in the aim

And don't be puttin up a front

I know you just met me babe

[Verse 2:]
I like my bitches slim in the waist, fat in the ass
Don't be on that hoe shit left that bag in the pac
For these bitches she ain't worried shawty all about that hussle
She ask you for some money she gon' bring you back double
And stay humble and the mayor get in the pole zone
I like my bitches bad as fuck with no clothes on
Both legged walk up in the crib with a blunt lit
She put them ashes out and she gon suck dick
She do it no hands serious as cancer
I run my finger through her hair to hold them strands up
Long hair don't care she got it from her mama
Down to that pearl everything's designer
Got her where I wanted now I'm going for the kill
And the way it's looking she gon' need a morning's after pill
She already know the deal but going raw if I let her
But let me slow you down baby girl I just met you

[Verse 3:]
Eventhough we just met girl
I ain't gon look at you no way
If you open up and play
Bust that pussy for a nigga
The right way
'Cause I want that, and I know you want this
So you can go front if you want
But the only thing is gonna happen is you gonna want
Me when I blow up rapping
And these hoes coming in out of my life
And I'm here with this paper getting right
BSB volume 2
King Sevin what you wanna do
Call up some and I got a few
And you know that they all gon come through
'Cause we them niggas industry
And that's the end there's no more beat
