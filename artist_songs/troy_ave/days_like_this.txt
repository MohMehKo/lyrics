[Hook:]
Alright, alright, mama never said there'll be days like this
Daddy need new shoes, flip the yay like this
Low pros with 22's, everyday like shit
Dark nights, fuck fights, we just spray out clips
Nigga the streets is cold, but my heart even colder
A war's going on outside, we all soldiers
A nigga fuck with me your minds he all over
Put your mom's face on a passing shoulder

[Verse 1:]
Days like this, nights like that
Afternoons with the goons, dumping spoons in the pack
Boy oh boy that's dope, call it troy, put a stamp on it, band on it
Then employ your workers with long sleeves, cause it's a cold world
Although the block is hot, of selling ol girl
In my younger days, I would give it off the well
Meaning it's mine I take it, if you got it, I weave it
Tony Montana, better grammar when I say shit
So you gonn understand or hit the hammer saying grape shit
6's on my feet, Olympic tire screech
Audi in the audi 4 rings I bought each
It tell cause I do dirt, it gain cause I move work
When my phone rings, order rings, cod no smurps or smiles
Cause I ain't no joke, I got a pure uncut coke, if you want I rock em

A nigga fuck with me your minds he all over
Put your mom's face on a passing shoulder

[Verse 2:]
It's kick back on the pound so I relax my shoulders
Then put your mom's face on the passing shoulder
Then I put my back on the wall and I hustle
Push up on the money, flex a little muscle
Mama never told me it'd be days like this
Stomach doing somersaults, I had to make that flip
And I ain't playing just to play, I'm tryina take that chip
But what's chip if you ain't all dip
I need the ball with the back to fall
On my grind like a skateboard
I gave her the half pipe, she couldn't take all
And I ain't paying for, I ain't do the rental bitch
These niggas acting like they don't but that's the difference
Old hoes checkin for me, new hoes checkin for me
I just check my rear view and keep a loaded weapon on me
The street's a rollercoaster, stay strapped in them
The feeling make me sick, but I'm back in them

[Verse 3:]
Young live nigga, dope as God vicious
So cool, no fuel, I'm just a fly nigga
Ain't about money, I can't even vibe with you
Haters tryina get under me, but I don't play twister
I play with your sister, then spray on the kisser
After that, send her back to lay with her mister
Yeah, you can't find a nigga doper,
Got the juice now from mixing soda with cocoa
Riding in the rover, looking over my shoulder
Cause I heard the DA got my face on a poster
Talking with my moms about when she found my toaster
And all the shoot outs and fights I had that have woke her
I'm colder, my mama never told me bout days like this
My grandma said hold your hands tight, pray like this
My uncle says snap your wrist, shoot the jay like this
He taught me how to dribble 2, but everyday I pitch, Lito
