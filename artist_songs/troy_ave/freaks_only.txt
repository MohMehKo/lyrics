This is for the freaks only
Yep...

[Chorus:]
She was sellin' freak shit in my speaker
And I was like go baby
She said she might even bring a friend with her
And I was like go baby
She said that tonight, is gon' be very special
She said that tonight, I get the 2 for 1 special like
Yep...
This is for the freaks only [x4]

Fresh outta jail, half a mill on my bail
Real street nigga you ain't about to tell
Fuck the CO went back the cell
Imma keep the name on the low, ion tell
Beggin' for the choice ain't emotions when I stroke
No winnin' out the city, murder strict is a joke
Still on vacation sex with me blow smoke
Sippin' champagne thru the five burry on the boat
Just left the beat with my babygirl
She with Troy Ave and we bussin' to the radio
Song comes on while she on my dick
She gon turn it up yeah that's my shit word

[Chorus]

I like me a nasty bitch, sassy bitch
Rollin' in the back and grab the dick
Give a nigga head and use extra spit
Fuck in 3 hours and she mad I quit
Freak some, lowkey no pictures,
She like getting rough and she even like bitches
I bought a close friend and gave him all then just kisses
I said how come, she said boy we like sisters
Ion judge no gown
I just keep it on the hush not a sound
She talkin' her freaky shit, you kno a nigga down
It can be the 2 of us and bring a friend around word?

[Chorus]

This is for the freaks only [x4]
