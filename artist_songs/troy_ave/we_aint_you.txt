[Hook:]
Sippin champagne for the pains cause I drown with
Pardonin these lames, it's insane how they mind different
Fuck up out my lane, we no same, nigga I'm different
Simple mathematics, take away all the bullshit
Man you got me in the spot, I am free, you is not
Couple G from the jump, I'm just waitin for my shot
Fuck waitin, takin shots, and whoever on the top
Make room, I make yo way up out my spot, aha ha ha ha

[Verse:]
I see two nipples pierced on a kingsize bed
Move to my right palm trees and blue water all ahead
Shuf like somebody dodo about to give me head
But she ain't nobody mama, no baby father drama
Every day I got a lama, or a 80, or a pound
Better safe than sorry, in the pause I be around
The wolves in the full them sheeps' skin
But I am known to pack 2 and I be beastin
I do it with straps, I do it with raps
It's me in the club nigga, I do it with racks
Sippin on buffered, been hustling facts
Bitches in love, I love to fuck with em back
When I was a teenager I was about my paycheck
Advances from genesis, I ain't talkin bout Sega
Now I'm in my 20's and out here doin it major
Without a deal, we sincerely get that payup

[Hook:]
Sippin champagne for the pains cause I drown with
Pardonin these lames, it's insane how they mind different
Fuck up out my lane, we no same, nigga I'm different
Simple mathematics, take away all the bullshit
Man you got me in the spot, I am free, you is not
Couple G from the jump, I'm just waitin for my shot
Fuck waitin, takin shots, and whoever on the top
Make room, I make yo way up out my spot, aha ha ha ha
