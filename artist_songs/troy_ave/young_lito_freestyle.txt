I come straight from the ville
When niggas know nobody shit
My niggas choping bricks
But they not on no karate shit
Range with the body kit, rollie hanging out of it
Bad bitch passenger and she just wanna swallow dick
They call me the bad guy but everywhere I'm good
My bitch run track but see me I run the hood
I do it like I should in the condo smoking good
Ice hanging off the balcony bitch I think I should
But I'm more like Michy I'm shining like I'm Geechy
I just go to the jeweler and I tell that nigga freeze me
And tell these bitches what they wanna hear and they believe me
I be like you got 3 wishes baby I'm your genie
Then I fuck 'em and don't call
Ballin like John Wall
My cousin say yo dog
Them bitches be on y'all
'Cause when you don't long they ready to go
And you ain't gotta tell 'em my name 'cause they already know
It's Lito!
