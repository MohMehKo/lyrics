[Intro/Hook:]
Some niggas is real, some niggas is fake
Some niggas is wolves, some niggas is snakes
But B$B we can't relate, to you broke ass niggas that hate
We see through fakes, all my niggas is apes

[Verse:]
Uhh, My man got shot an he changed, he paranoid, move funny nigga ain't the same
Instead of finding homies nigga rather play the games, picture that he was almost blown out the frame
If that was me I woulda been riding with them thangs, anxious ready to go and fry a nigga brains
A coward try to take my life he gotta be dumb, woulda emptied the 16 clip on somebody son
Somebodys dead, ambulance somebody come, witnesses from the scene they out like a drum
Listen you ride for me, I ride for you but actions speak loud and I'm the keeper of my brother
No heat I'll cut ya, for mine I'm riding all night like a trucka
Lifes a bitch but I need her I love her, but I seen some real niggas lose they life for a sucka
I seen some of the softest put holes through a man, and I watched some niggas put they team in a can
I don't understand that's why I ride around real militant, Your worst enemy be the nigga you chilling with
Niggas is flagrant undercover agents same niggas you bang with be the ones that get you hanged quick
It's only fam around me, ask Hovain I was a killer when he found
Iaint vocal, nah I ain't social, say the wrong thing I'll have a young nigga smoke you
I don't mean jokes my killas will really roast you, for the bread they right up your ass just like the goats do
Riding with the gats, nina in my lap, killed my nigga Scootey can't bring my nigga back
My idol in the dirt and my brother in the max and I want to put in work but they got me doing tracks
I cut Smalls off cause he was fucking up the packs, I cut my cousin off cause he turned into a rat
Shit been on my mind so I put it in my raps, If you feel a way then fuck it nigga ya know where I'm at
I'm hear nigga, guarding my rear nigga, getting dressed tryna see what hammer to wear nigga
Niggas is jealous of me but fuck it I dare a nigga, 7 in the cut he been feeding the air nigga
Evene if your tires blew out I don't spare a nigga
Woo I'm feeling like Flair nigga, Woo I'm feeling like Flair nigga
Make ya boy disappear nigga woo, nigga this is magic, ride around with the Ratchet
Let a fuck nigga have it, Young Lito
