[Intro 1:]
Put on Law & Order but just keep it on mute
Yea I always gotta watch Law & Order when I hook up

Monday I need a play
Tuesday you could decay
Wednesday you came back
It was the first of the month

[Intro 2:]
I like that song
Aha
Powder
Let me tell it to ya

[Verse 1:]
I'm just a fly nigga from the block, from the block
I'm startin to rap and I'm getting hot, getting hot
I'm behind hoes swinging on my jock, on my jock
I lost my girl cause I wouldn't stop, wouldn't stop
Bustin these pretty bitches that I meet, that I meet
Man I don't know a nigga who won't cheat, who don't cheat
That why I like a chick that know the deal, know the deal
Don't gotta lie, I could keep it real

[Hook:]
Will you ride in my Mercedes-cedes-cedes-cedes-cedes
Let's take a ride baby
Take a ride in my Mercedes-cedes-cedes-cedes-cedes
I knew you would just come on down
We ride in my Mercedes-cedes-cedes-cedes-cedes
Take a ride in my Mercedes-cedes-cedes-cedes-cedes
Powder.

[Verse 2:]
We all go mob headed to the club, to the club
I got this new chick, she cool as fuck, that's what's up
I hit her once she was cool to fuck, cool to fuck
Her nipples pierced and she cute as fuck, fat ol' butt
She tells the girls to come meet as here, meet us here
She know we like to meet our meters here with long hair
When they arrive she say hey boo, hey boo
Then grab my hand and say this is you

[Hook:]
Will you ride in my Mercedes-cedes-cedes-cedes-cedes?
Let's take a ride baby
Take a ride in my Mercedes-cedes-cedes-cedes-cedes
I knew you would just come on down
We ride in my Mercedes-cedes-cedes-cedes-cedes
Take a ride in my Mercedes-cedes-cedes-cedes-cedes
Powder.

[Verse 3:]
It's crazy how I'm startin to be that nigga
This rap shit getting bigger and bigger
I know you heard about the drugs I deal
Forget them rumors even tho they fa real
That's about to be my history
I'm getting 5 grand for a show lately
The same amount of profit I would make per key (I would make on a key)
That's why the streets fuck with me
I get busy

[Hook:]
Will you ride in my Mercedes-cedes-cedes-cedes-cedes?
Let's take a ride baby
Take a ride in my Mercedes-cedes-cedes-cedes-cedes
I knew you would just come on down
We ride in my Mercedes-cedes-cedes-cedes-cedes
Take a ride in my Mercedes-cedes-cedes-cedes-cedes
Powder.
