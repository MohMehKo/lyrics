[Intro:]
Man you know how these bitches be
If you can't get in to call this shit
You know what I'm sayin?
And everything be good in the beginnings
Like yea you know, we're just friends and whatever,
You didn't know
Emotions start getting hold of love
Maybe half of the most but
We ain't them sucka ass niggas over here, you know what I'm sayin?
Aye just get all rainin out on you, you know what I mean?
Powder

[Hook:]
She lovin my style, she say I be on some smooth shit (oh baby)
We ain't no relationship, we just on some cool shit (oh baby)
Every now and then she get crazy on some fool shit (oh baby)
I tell er you my bitch
And this yo dick
But only when we're together

[Verse 1:]
I skip this chick from Harlem and she had all of the swag
But she ain't had more to me so I was over my ass
G I'm self-made from the county of the kings
And I be get you down flyer than the bare wings
I picked her up from the airport and we played house
But she didn't add time, she said she takin me out (leave em a tip)
When the card declined I wouldn't pay that cash
Bout a week went by and she ain't paid back fast
The money is nothing, it's just a principle loving
And the food was disgusting, rather felits when I does it
She came over for gain actin like she ain't over
I said do you got that paper? The bitch told me no
I said cool, you keep it, I wasn't even ferior
She said hold that for dinner, it ain't even in serious
That reverse psychology don't work on me
She try to play on my ego, I made a play like Debri
Get up

[Hook:]
She lovin my style, she say I be on some smooth shit (oh baby)
We ain't no relationship, we just on some cool shit (oh baby)
Every now and then she get crazy on some fool shit (oh baby)
I tell er you my bitch
And this yo dick
But only when we're together

[Verse 2:]
It's Blocksdale baby and I should let you know
Although I'm new NY I ain't yo average Joe
Bitches come and they go
Literally come and they go
And if it's not yo day, why the fuck you callin me fo?
Mr. Telephone Man got that candy girl
You wanna be my new addition but you can't be girl
Not takin no applications, my work can employ a nation
When together I'm thinkin bout money I could be chasin

[Hook:]
She lovin my style, she say I be on some smooth shit (oh baby)
We ain't no relationship, we just on some cool shit (oh baby)
Every now and then she get crazy on some fool shit (oh baby)
I tell er you my bitch
And this yo dick
But only when we're together

Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby
