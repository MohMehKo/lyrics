[Intro:]
This a hit, This a hit
Always wanted to say that, you know rocking with the sounds of B$B
King Sevin and Troy A-V-E uh 1-2 1-2
Going to go through some things going on in our daily life, PowdeRRR

[Hook: Troy Ave]
It's a love story but I don't love her though [x6]
No no no cause I only love the dough

[Verse 1: King Sevin]
I been trying to tell these bitches I ain't shit but they don't listen
If you ain't gonna let me cook get the fuck up out the kitchen
Cause we eating at this table shawty what you bringing to it?
Tell me that you love me baby girl you got to prove it
If I see it then I'll call it but you know I ain't tripping cause that's too close to falling
You putting up a front but on the low I see you plotting
But playing hard to get gonna get you easily forgotten
Cause success is the only option with my time I be selective
So when I'm on my grind I need my bitch to be aggressive
But they rather be detectives trying to be all up in my business
Need to get off Instagram and focus on the bigger picture
Like it or not just need my chick to be loyal
So when I make it to the top that's one I'll spoil
But I don't sweat it I just kill it or I dead them
Cause they hoes will get you caught up if you let them I'm trying to tell you

[Hook: Troy Ave]
It's a love story but I don't love her though [x6]
No no no cause I only love the dough

[Verse 2: King Sevin]
That's why I keep me a side bitch who be on some fly shit
Bad bitch good credit stand about 5'6
Used run track so she stack and her thicks thick
Long hair short temper and she know how to ride dick
I keep her eyes lite when that money coming
She keep her body right all we do is money running
Yeah we on that paper chase I hold her down like a paper weight
Sex is always better when your paper is straight
This ain't a love story but she got love for me
She don't take shots she would take a slug for me
I put my trust in her and she gonna thug for me
Take the stand and lie before the judge for me
And she don't judge homie know I got the snug on me
And when the boys come she going to throw it in the clutch for me
And we don't beef cause she know what's at stake
If you want us to be good you got to let me be great

[Hook: Troy Ave]
It's a love story but I don't love her though [x6]
No no no cause I only love the dough

[Outro:]
King Sevin B$B Records I'm gone
And I only love the dough PowderRRR
