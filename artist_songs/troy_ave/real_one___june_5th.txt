[Real One]

[Hook:]
I made my name up in these streets like a real nigga
I keep them pistols in my Jeep like a real nigga
I make sure all my homies eat like a real nigga
I fuck your bitch and go to sleep like a real nigga

Man, all my pockets be obese cause I deal, nigga
A couple boxes, ain't no sneaks, just some bails, nigga
The way I handle all my beefs, I just kill niggas
If you one hundred, then you love me, I'm a real nigga

[Verse 1:]
Chargin' my phone, leave them chargers alone
I'm ridin' foreigns and Chargers, my rims are matte or they chrome
Smoke a blunt to the dome, I got some shit on my head
I turn some niggas to bone, fuck them all, they all dead
I get mad, I see red, livin' life, gettin' bread
Gettin' pussy, 'Fuck the opinions of pussies', I said
Real niggas on top, free [?] from the box
Free money or blocks, keep white like he Sox

[Verse 2:]
Studio thug, you can't do what I does
I am really a Blood, you just cool in 'em clubs
Before this rap, I had buzz, feds watchin' this shit
They jammed a D on that row, he ain't cooperate shit
I hold him down wit' that gauge for bein' real like I knew
Loyalty ain't no favor, nigga, it's just what we do
BSB is the crew, we get wild like a zoo
But all the time we like chillin', fuckin' wit' hoes by the two
Man, it's nothin', all these bitches is fuckin'
All these niggas is frontin', I see 'em, they owin' nothin'
I smack, shoot or snuff 'em, they don't respect my name
Violence my go-to move, I make 'em respect the paint

[June 5th]

[Hook:]
Was 'bout to buy a 'Rari, bought a tour bus
Thank God I get a Lambo wit' the doors up
Fuckin' niggas tell me I don't work it
I see them niggas every time they hurtin'
Pass a couple haters lookin' stressed out
You can't have your hand and your chest out
What you tryin' to hold, huh, nigga, what?
You can hold these shots, you can hold these nuts

[Verse 1:]
I got mad missions to accomplish
Runnin' through a bitch-nigga gauntlet
I can up the style, you give me what you got
I ain't tryin' to hit like a bitch is on
Some niggas throw shots, but it don't matter
Cause when I throw shots bones shatter
Break 'em down, break 'em down, break 'em
I'm the real deal, niggas fakin'
Moment of silence, I'm 'bout to kill niggas
You're bitin' my style, I'm 'bout to bill niggas
Swagger jackin' at an all-time high
And I ain't really mad, I am that guy
A fisher with the fish scale, you a tuna
Little nigga, I'm the big whale and the shooter
Violater sent you to hell, oh, well, your L
Eleven thou' in my pocket that I could throw in a fire
And I won't feel it cause, real shit, all my stacks gettin' higher
On the top pointin' higher, on a roll like a casa
Most these niggas' vagina, I'm lookin' 'round with defiance
Like, damn with these niggas that be so tough
My phone in my hand, nobody still ain't called my bluff
I got it off grams, these other rappers not so much
Not so much, the chuck is up, real nigga shit
