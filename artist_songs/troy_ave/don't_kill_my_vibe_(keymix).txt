[Hook:]
Relax your mind and let your conscience be free
You're not listening to that nigga Troy Ave, it's Troy A V E
I am the hottest rapper out of my town, New York City is where I put it down
And you can believe in this 'cause I would never lead you wrong
Rep the streets, you know my song I'm out to sing when it's clear
My music different from these tight jeans clowns, they wrack the beat

[Verse:]
Troy Ave or Jesus, the new king, y'all don't know yet
Learn some while you burn some hot praise low life expect
Can't see 'cause I'm in the queue, low business snow business
Rain slitting, hell grown business, pray to God Jehovah bring no witness
Testify on my testicles, on beat not court seats
All I got is my word and balls and I'd die before I break each
One teach one, together still we won
Took a couple loses but we profound wisdom
Like ways them niggas stay, we gonna post that and later
Down, we never fuck around 'cause fear equals pain
Money or time but time is money
So I'm committing these crimes, watching for times that's sunny
My dog, always hope for the best for I'm prepared for the worst
When you sell dope with the best you people pay for a hundred
Till then I'm killing these streets, they dying for me to blow
I brought New York new life, the real one's already snow

[Hook:]
Relax your mind and let your conscience be free
You're not listening to that nigga Troy Ave, it's Troy A V E
I am the hottest rapper out of my town, New York City is where I put it down
And you can believe in this 'cause I would never lead you wrong
Rep the streets, you know my song I'm out to sing when it's clear
My music different from these tight jeans clowns, they wrack the beat

[Outro:]
When I drop New York City the album, shit gonna change, man
The whole climate is just gonna shift
Back to this street music, the highest quality of street music
Street music reigning supreme
Any area, any region, you check the history
I'm bringing it back to that
