[Verse:]
Them niggas don't drive like me, they don't shout like me
He ain't never go put in work with a man like me
If you ain't death, dumb and a blind then you must see
That I'm the only new nigga reppin NYC
The right way, big body Benz, I might say
Drop top Jeep on a right day
See me in Barclay, tickets for the season
And I'm the next fan boy, flows for no reason
Money long, short temper and it's never you won't feel it
Nice, ironic, I got the chubby home, chubby gone
But I'm bass, new weight, odo rims say
Real life, one take, and scene of the crowd
They ain't even know my rely I sweep fine
Many chicks laying next to me, really just be fine
Tell er why I'm on the low, red bone ergo
And I do that, left her snoarin in Kettlo

Or should I call it New York City: The Album?
It's on her motherfuckin way
We droppin these chizz every phrase so every 15th of the month
I'm a restore the feeling
And then take it somewhere else, you heard?
In the bag when Dib sat and G-Unit they was dropping quality and quantity music
Niggas lost that, niggas lost their identity
They don't know who the fuck they
Nigga I'm proud to be from New York
Nigga I'm from Brooklyn nigga
This what I represent nigga
I show that, you seen on my videos, you hear it in my voice
You seen in my swag
I got chick too on my motherfuckin collar nigga
Come on man, what fuck here's got a white leather with the chinchilla
Man the niggas used to rock the white avorex leathers
I was too young to get one
But I said man once I get old enough I'm a restore the feeling
I got a white but it's soft leather
With chinchilla on the cop, nigga that boy cray
BSB period nigga, ain't nobody fuckin with us
That's a fact
We was going hard in America
In case you didn't know
Troy Ave, aha
