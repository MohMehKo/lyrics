[Verse 1:]
Please Luv pardon my aggression
And man are all seeking your attention
I call you love 'cause I forgot your name when the teacher mentioned it
Doing yesterday's class money took attendance call me Archie
Damn, (what kind of name is that?)
Oh, just a stage name I use when I rap
(Are you a rapper? like the leggings of the kids)
Actually no girl a little more than that
As you can see, I'm here pursuing a degree
Tryina stay out of trouble not get caught up in these streets
Not to mention I'm top 5 of freshmen MC's
Producer, song writer and a lot so you should see
But you inspire me so I had to break the ice in
Let you know what I see I really like
Can I walk you to your next class I hope that you don't mind
(Well since you ask so nice, that would be fine)

[Hook:]
Hey Luv
Ave got it in this motherfucker
Hey Luv
Archie Bang in this motherfucker
Hey Luv
Brooklyn ye we in it
Hey Luv
By the end of the song say that you ain't with it

[Verse 2:]
Conversation progress she smiled and in the ear said
(The sun will shine, it really ain't clear
Like you make me feel safe ye there's something I should feel)
Listen baby you ain't get us get that nonsense out of here
Ain't quite what it used to simple that I move through
Hipsters, husslers, only we don't do rules
(All y'all don't do rules?)
Never not at all prescription pills, marijuana and alot of alcohol
Gotta admit that you're like keep them goons pretty fly
I'm on that NSD that never say die shit
We on them hypers like BSB
Cokemania tea ye she lovin the G
Now shawty I gotta breeze got some business to attend to
Add a little vay after that I bring the bottle
If you want come and check you, she said cool
I be chillin with my girlfriend shootin me and text some
I'm a show you how to work this

[Hook:]
Hey Luv
Ave got it in this motherfucker
Hey Luv
Archie Bang in this motherfucker
Hey Luv
Brooklyn ye we in it
Hey Luv
By the end of the song tell me that you ain't with it

[Verse 3:]
Meanwhile in Brooklyn willin in the range
Rover pulled over like hey what's your name
Told her who I am, she said, I already know it
And she said powder, I said we were going
Open up the door, joe down in her panties
Shit be mixy we around with them hammers
Bounce to my niggas introduce my new boo
That was just talking she know the shit too
Order us a corn and a chicken diablo
A little later on I'm a see if she swallow
But now it's show time shit feel like Apollo
Everybody watching, everybody jogging
Jail pulled up and the drop ain't snocky
BSB vol 2 this shit poppin
Then homie you ain't payin to see me for a brick
It's that old shit, this the same beat

[Hook:]
Hey Luv
Ave got it in this motherfucker
Hey Luv
Archie Bang in this motherfucker
Hey Luv
Brooklyn ye we in it
Hey Luv
By the end of the song say that you ain't with it
