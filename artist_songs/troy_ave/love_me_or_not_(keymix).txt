[Hook:]
Either you love me or you love me not
I'm a do me
I'm known for fucking with bitches and running these streets
And baby, the streets pay me
So I'm in 'em 24/7, 365 days
Either you love me or you love me not
I'm a do me
I'm known for fucking with bitches and running these streets
And baby, the streets pay me
So I'm in 'em 24/7, 365 daily

[Verse 1:]
Either you love me or you love me not, I'm a be me
Like I told you before, I don't know a nigga who don't cheat
I ain't seen no fucking hoe bitching in over a year
Only time she on my mind is when you put it in my ear
I took a vacant flight but I just gave her the pipe
I gave you a lot of my time and that's worth more than some light
You ain't my girl from the white, you don't pay bills, why stay?
Is making your point worth the fight if you only jog me away?
That's how my last girl do it, that's how I even got with you, memories
Grandma pops had mad bitches and my grandfather get to it
This shit in my blood, it ain't never been personal
Your friends tell you about me, they got it way worse than you
Got no man or achievements, they box those game doing grievers
Why the fuck is you beefing? We both know you ain't leaving
Don't get with a nigga you don't like, a bird ass nigga might swing this
Why get with another nigga who ain't like me but still do the same thing?

[Hook:]
Either you love me or you love me not
I'm a do me
I'm known for fucking with bitches and running these streets
And baby, the streets pay me
So I'm in 'em 24/7, 365 days
Either you love me or you love me not
I'm a do me
I'm known for fucking with bitches and running these streets
And baby, the streets pay me
So I'm in 'em 24/7, 365 daily

[Verse 2:]
Shawty you got this shit slinging like the Eiffel
You ain't Kobe Bryant bitch why you chasing the title
All up in my business hoe my attention's to wife you
Going through my mentions now my bitches wanna fight you
That ain't even like you, used to be a cool ass chick
Now you flipping out here acting the fool like shit
What's wrong with you? you tripping like your shoes tied together
You ain't my only girl 'cause we ain't not together
See I'm about that cheddar like crack a barrel this ain't intervention
I ain't trying to break habits round you
Shit I was a dog when you met me, gon be one if you left me
I ain't tryin to make it right I'm comfortable being left here
See I'm just doing me, you doing you
So why the fuck we goin round the circles like hoola hoop
Either you love me or you love me not it's simple as that
Just keep that thing on when I'm in it from the back
