[Intro:]
These niggas cannot fuck around with me
Because I'm not with that chuck shit that they be on
Telling lies in their songs, I know it's sad but true
Y'all need Ridley Scott 'cause the G is up, powder

[Hook:]
Spit your last case, you ain't been high, you on some broke shit
She don't know who her baby buy, she on some hoe shit
You scared to fail, won't even try, you on some joke shit
Shorty having that BSB, yeah, we on some dope shit
Getting money niggas, you can get money with us
If you bring the fuck business, I'm gonna finger fuck triggers
Stay hustling, stay loyal, king's county, stay royal
Never trick on hoes but make sure your main g's spoiled

[Verse 1:]
It's Troy Ave, New York City in this motherfucker
I'm going drastic, no pity on these little suckers
New sheriff in town, I represent us right
Fuck police, wear my crown, I am the king of white
Powder, name synonymous we cooking, nigga
Fucking bitches booking niggas, I'm a Brooklyn nigga
Drop top driver, smooth skin, Godiva
Chocolate boy won them more rocks then pit fire
Is what the fiends say, I done made 9 000 on a Wednesday
The boulevard of broken dreams is where we stay
With more heavy metal than Green Day
21 guns

[Hook:]
Spit your last case, you ain't been high, you on some broke shit
She don't know who her baby buy, she on some hoe shit
You scared to fail, won't even try, you on some joke shit
Shorty having that BSB, yeah, we on some dope shit
Getting money niggas, you can get money with us
If you bring the fuck business, I'm gonna finger fuck triggers
Stay hustling, stay loyal, king's county, stay royal
Never trick on hoes but make sure your main g's spoiled

[Verse 2:]
I'm the hottest nigga out in the streets, you already smell it
I'm self-made and too beast 'cause I stay focused
I won't sign for less than a million bucks and that price growing
I'm performing live at Summer Jam, you ain't even going
Yeah, they just can't fuck with me, man
