[Hook:]
Lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some people get to change, some go changeless
Some worry bout the name, wanna be famous
Some end up with they brain blown off by the stainless

[Verse 1:]
Through the TV and I'm like yo ain't shit on
It's me and Pac, should be a little long hair thick joint
It's all before I stroke er, she workin on my shoulders
But on a side note, what the fuck is maybe soda?
And see my nigga since we made a trade for them gats
I caught a body with his shit, I hope he don't want it back
Frontin ass nigga deserved it, please don't judge, you ain't perfect
I hold court in the street and murder was the verdict
Jewelry on, baby girl mine is my ice
And it's my birthday, I did 25, now life remains
I sip the pain and twist the Jane
Hit the flame, I just want the money, fuck the fame
Be ashamed that they said Troy Ave that nigga
And my bank account sayin I got low ass figures
I am highly motivated by these broke ass niggas
Any funny moves, know I blow smoke, yea niggas

[Verse 2:]
My partner through the decade, my codename Jefe
Plus I'm known to whip it like Kunta Kente
I'm for my side bitch so imagine what my lady got
Used a Maybach like the Marriott
Brought her for her clothes holmes
Used her for her jewelry box and chain spot
Just order shrimp, fried rice straight out the chain spot
Organized crime, if it was a team I'd be on the starter 5, sippin lean with my guys
Havin the same cocaine nightmares
I wear jewelry like Nikes, brick look like iPads
Menace to society, get something new although
Tight cash, they think all I do is turn up songs
You know my lifestyle, easy come, easy go
The Panamera cleaner than a bar of soap
I stay level headed with a Giuseppe fetish
Guess it's hereditary cause my dad was a felon
