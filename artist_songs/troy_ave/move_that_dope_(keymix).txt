Young nigga move that dope,

Young nigga move that dope,

Howl, nigga move that dope!

Young nigga, move that dope
Shit, I really move that coke, for real
Rappers be rapping and rapping and acting
And rapping and bagging them still.
Old facts, no lesson
Most stacks of the compressor
Red [?] Annie Franklin
Guess I'm not AK
Revolving clocks when we spray
Amongst each other when we play
Amongst others when we safe
Not a word, [?] clowns
I do not want your fake hugs and pounds
What you want? I got judge around
White powder, more cops around
White power, no cops around
Money and respect when I touch you down
Whole sail and I bust you down
I'm a dope dealer, can't pin no crown
New York is my fucking town, two folks when I'm melting down
Hey yo, hey bro, free my nigga Jay-O!

[Hook: x2]

Howl, nigga move that coke!

Howl, nigga move that dope!

I talk that, cause I live that
It's a fact, dwag, that I did that
You chuck niggas need to get back
Nigga, back, back!

Back bitch back and forth
Major without a deal coming soon
I guarantee it's gonna be all the [?]
I know I never plan this!
Now I put the facts
We're putting facts here.
Men do what they say and say what they mean
I came in the game to stand out, not to fit in
This why everything I've been doing has been outstanding
Stop me when I'm lying!
Lord, forgive me! Houdie [?]
Free my homie Jay O!
They jailed him up in a Commonwealth State
Real dope boys for real!
