[Intro:]
I don't care what your girl did like last night nigga
'Cause when she with me nigga
Everything is alright nigga

[Hook:]
They don't do it like this, I make my money free
So I be dead fresh like they came up out of zip
They don't do it like this I pull up in some shit
You niggas need a cab I never see y'all in whips
They don't do it like this, rollie on my wrist
My real one too not none of that fake shit
They don't do it like this, I don't ever trip
All my hoes bad you better look at my bitch

[Verse 1:]
And my cool off the shit and
I sold all my bricks
These niggas just spit it
But they don't really live it
My shoulder got a cheat in
My neck and my realest
My eyes real but being real don't mean shit
The rap game fit it all the fags lane in it
Lock the doors and feel the shit I kick it
Nigga nigga John just got 10 he gotta bidding
I could be just like him, but this my ticket out of the hood
For you I'm living good
To me I have my engine and the truck, fuck the hood
I ain't got no mercy, death to em all
If I share a certain story too probably it could be poor
A nigga did what? he should be in jail
Only God will judge me I hope I won't be in hell
Burn the blunt burn the house mallet toe tell
You don't know what that mean but my niggas know well

[Hook:]
They don't do it like this, I make my money free
So I be dead fresh like they came up out of zip
They don't do it like this I pull up in some shit
You niggas need a cab I never see y'all in whips
They don't do it like this, rollie on my wrist
My real one too not none of that fake shit
They don't do it like this, I don't ever trip
All my hoes bad you better look at my bitch

[Verse 2:]
They don't do it like Lito
Paid 'em for like I'm Rico
Pluck from the album my bitch from Puerto Rico
She say papi, a osmio your wrist frio
I say panache, mommy put you on for my pio
I do it bigger than Nino
Pack as big as my ego
These other niggas cool but they ain't fucking with me no
And stash money I probably lost that plan Cee Lo
Lifestyle expansible what we got it for cheat though
Powder, trapping every hour
Your bitch get wet every time I'm around her
Crib full of hoes and my lungs full of sour
They used to do me dirty now I hit 'em in the shower
My money louder, you niggas turned down
I know you heard I'm that nigga now
And I could tell y'all niggas quite pissed
Mad 'cause you're out to do it

[Hook:]
They don't do it like this, I make my money free
So I be dead fresh like they came up out of zip
They don't do it like this I pull up in some shit
You niggas need a cab I never see y'all in whips
They don't do it like this, rollie on my wrist
My real one too not none of that fake shit
They don't do it like this, I don't ever trip
All my hoes bad you better look at my bitch

[Verse 3:]
They don't do it like this, these niggas basic
They just talk about ballin I call 'em skit banish
I ride no teeth, I know these hoes watching
Sevin from Brooklyn but I ain't talking Joe Johnson
I'm in that ball clear, my picture's on the wall
My seats next to the bench and I don't even ball
The losers do the losing, my team straight winning
I run it with the bucks like the homie be jennings
My clique slicker than rick I'm cooler than the thugs
Lookin like a road map only tats on my arm
I pull up with the swag, I fuck 'em with the charm
Now she chasing after a ray 'cause bitch thinks she wrong
I riding with the heat 'cause niggas stay willin
But I'm better with the green like the boy Ray Allen
Catch on an island with a bitch from the Islands
And we giving 0 fucks but that swag on the thousands
King Sevin
