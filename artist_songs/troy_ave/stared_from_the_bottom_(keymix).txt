Started with a condom, now we here
Started with the topping and she said don't spill it in my hair
Started with a condom, now we here
She said tell me when you coming and don't get it in my hair nigga

[Verse 1:]
Hoes tell stories to their man
Say they never fucked a nigga, I don't really give a damn
I know about the stories to they friends
They say Ave did good but girl I can never be with him
Now I'm bustin shorty who she told
Said she wanna see what's good about it but I gotta keep it low
I'm a keep it quiet out the door
You keep yo ass up, face down, get it when I let it go

[Hook: x2]
Started with a condom, now we here
Started with the topping and she said don't spill it in my hair
Started with a condom, now we here
She said tell me when you coming and don't get it in my hair nigga

[Verse 2:]
These corny ass rappers come from hopes
But you can see it in yo bed if you see it in the video
And you ain't gotta pay, you can have it
I know my nigga Dame F, K fuck ah ah in it
7 hittin world star chicks
And I got bitches on TV, real live hits
I can never say we kissed on the lips
But I be yolin they mouth just to workin this dick

[Hook: x2]
Started with a condom, now we here
Started with the topping and she said don't spill it in my hair
Started with a condom, now we here
She said tell me when you coming and don't get it in my hair nigga

[x2:]
No paid bitches nigga we don't play that
I'm a fake trick, call a real one back
If you lookin for a nigga tryna profit
Every dollar that I get go in my pocket

[Outro:]
Every dollar I get go in my pocket
Unless you travelling with me
And you holding something on you
That we gon flip and turn for profit
Can't get in a big shit nigga
Fuck I look like?
Yo money spend just like mine
Nigga it's easy for a bitch to come up
All they gotta do is meet a nigga that's into some shit that gotta do a getting money
And he's a sucka he gon spend
Wait motherfucker, it's my freedom for money
I wish I would
Let them other niggas trick, we'll spend it together
That's a fact
I ain't out here playing, nigga I don't make this shit up
Fuck with me
Appreciate this shit mane,
These niggas ain't making music like this
Nobody don't sound like me, I sound like myself
