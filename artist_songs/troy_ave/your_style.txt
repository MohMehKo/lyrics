[Intro:]
See now I went to the club and I ran into this girl
And she was telling bout how she feel and everything
Her name was New York
But she said Troy listen

[Pre-Hook:]
She said yo new shit pumpin, you make us so proud
We've been wantin something this good for a while
But I'm not fooled dimples on yo face
Cus when we dances I felt that fit full on yo waist
And you know

[Hook:]
She like my style, she like my flows
It ain't no truck involved, she knows
I came for far from being low
Been on my grind and now it shows
Ain't nobody round who sound like this
We ain't the same, they rode that dick
Fuck them lames, get down with this
Pop champagne, girl shake yo hips

[Verse 1:]
White feeter with the cake
She got the long hair, ain't nothing fake
All blue thong with the stars on it
Layin in my bed and she all on it
The one back before I burn the cat
Two steppin in the club with my dogs all strapped
There for dough, playin with the bitches
A flashy young nigga before we took the pictures
I can take yo number, can't be yo man
But you can act like it in yo Instagram
I like flippin grands and you like me
And if you into getting money baby you like me
Come on, I'm out here, sound the alarm
I heard one good girl is worth 1000 whores
One good song is worth 1000 tones
So before proceed with yo boy

[Pre-Hook:]
She said yo new shit pumpin, you make us so proud
We've been wantin something this good for a while
But I'm not fooled dimples on yo face
Cus when we dances I felt that fit full on yo waist
And you know

[Hook:]
She like my style, she like my flows
It ain't no truck involved, she knows
I came for far from being low
Been on my grind and now it shows
Ain't nobody round who sound like this
We ain't the same, they rode that dick
Fuck them lames, get down with this
Pop champagne, girl shake yo hips

[Verse 2:]
Shawty got a thing for me, it's only right I slide with her
Spoil with money ice and there was G's there sayin
Poppin like I'm celebratin, spend a week in the pane
Next two cities I'm a sleep on the plane
One time for keeping it real
Still in yo heart where you stay
Liftin yo feet up, like the marksman I aim to leave em
Sometimes for all these non-believers, now we even
I think your run is a public of line up out of the seasons
You're beside me for a reason
Come check the breeze out with the flyest nigga breathing
Everything here is mine for keeping
I see you're reaching
You want that vibe back
Bodies on my Hawaii hat, gotta be in my Palm rap still
Catch a contact, chill
Gather yo mind back
We in from the gutter baby, hold out, shine that
New faces every morning, I recover
Feeling like we never knew each other

[Pre-Hook:]
She said yo new shit pumpin, you make us so proud
We've been wantin something this good for a while
But I'm not fooled dimples on yo face
Cus when we dances I felt that fit full on yo waist
And you know

[Hook:]
She like my style, she like my flows
It ain't no truck involved, she knows
I came for far from being low
Been on my grind and now it shows
Ain't nobody round who sound like this
We ain't the same, they rode that dick
Fuck them lames, get down with this
Pop champagne, girl shake yo hips
