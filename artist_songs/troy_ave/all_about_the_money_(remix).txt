[Rick Ross:]
(Menace II Society), co-(Caine) brothers
My (Dog) made three feds magazine covers
Get shot for the Beat, wash up on the beach
Butt-naked full of holes, Timbs on ya feet
Ya stretched on the block, cover with the top
Backwood, stay strapped, smokin in the dark
Niggaz snitch on forty niggaz, have you writin books
I'm from the city, testify and get yo' body took
Fuck 'em all, rat sold me cause I hold the cheese
Been had 'em and it's golden, now it's time to squeeze
Fifty stacks of coca, boy, now pay the penalty
Fuck all your kids, I swear to God you gon' remember me
Words are powerful, it's time to see my niggaz eat
In the two-seater in Atlanta pickin up mean
Ferrari or the Lambo cause I got 'em both
Nigga took a chain next they know I got 'em smoked
Never robbed, baby I'm so forever mob
I'm out in Vegas at the Palms playin paddleball
Push the button, I can turn this bitch to battle-all
Kill yourself nigga, HOW YOU RAT ON ALL YOUR DOGS?!
Play my position, here I am, so now it's time to BALL
...Troy Ave, now it's time to BALL!!

[Chorus - Manolo Rose:]
It’s all about the motherfuckin money!
It’s all about the motherfuckin money!
It’s all about the motherfuckin money!
It’s all about the motherfuckin money!

[Troy Ave:]
I flourish under the fire laugh in the face of doubt
You ain’t got enough money in your fingers to count me out
BSB Records make the cypher complete
We the number one independent label in the streets
...And you s'know that
Free Abdul Mateen, gotta get my bro back
Drummer! Salute to the fans, supporters, DJ’s, always
Powder!
