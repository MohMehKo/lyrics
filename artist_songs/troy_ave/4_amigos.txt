[Verse 1: Young Lito]
See I hear them talking about it but they ain't ever got it
See me I go and get it being broke is not an option
Had this profit, get the money divide it on the average
Stretch it till it flips called that shit gymnastics
Thses niggas living savage turn my paper into plastic
Getting money just hobby, bank accounts is just a habit
Cause me I gotta have it all, looking at the bigger picture rip the frame up off the wall
I'm the one these bitches call cause homie I make it happen
I don't rub my hands together my nigga I get it clapping
And I ain't into acting but they call me Samuel Jackson
Leave these bitches in suspense but I'm all about that action
And we dealing on the facts you can try me if you want really ain't no coming back
Stupid nigga tryna front playing with my green I'm a roll up like a blunt
Head cracked then I split him down the middle like a dutch

[Verse 4: King Sevin]
I'm a dope young nigga that's known for getting these racks
I'm strapped everyday with that revolver or mac
Fox fur on my back python on my hat know PETA can't stand me cause we killing these rats
I'm all that and a bag of chips ball like a Maverick
If I ain't out smashing chicks I'm in the crib bagging zips
Rocking European fits fly like Delta came a long way from that hamburger helper
Know we in Friscos drinking Cris like it's seltzer
Water but I'm on fire bitch I might melt-ya
Feeling like I'm next started from the projects now I'm in the studio recording with Wyclef
After that business back whipping in the pyrex
Cause I love the hoes but money makes my eyes stretch
Money is my mindset niggas say I changed
But I ain't hustle this hard to stay the same
