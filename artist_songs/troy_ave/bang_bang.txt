[Verse 1:]
Shots fired, niggas dying it's a crime wave
Money stacking, bitches popping it's how crime pay
Set up shop, profit of dealing rock
Keep it in my socks, low from the cops
Brandville fly bush East New York nigga
Beds on, crown heights, look here motherfucker
It's Brooklyn motherfucker, show your juice out
Get it took it motherfucker surfing in the kitchen
Have a fiend do the break up, hating on the click
Have your heart and soul buttered benz be high shit
Y'all niggas shut the fuck up
Before I pick a chess and jersey
Have your ass hung up crack dealer wizard
I deal exquisite leader anybody
Shut up my nigga Gaddy hit that and burn 'em
With the 12 getting shawty looking for the building
How he's calling for his mommy
That's a true fucking story for you

[Hook:]
Bang bang BSB gang you know the name
With the glock I shoot that thing you out the game
Repping for the killers, repping we the realest
Dead motherfuckers we some known drug dealers
Bang bang BSB gang you know the name
With the glock I shoot that thing you out the game
Repping for the killers, repping we the realest
Dead motherfuckers we some known drug dealers

[Verse 2:]
I'm out in Cali talking about a million dollar deal
Shit it different them niggas dream get me real
Wake the fake niggas up tell them counterback
All that front shit there have a heartattack
No love for these hoes love for these o's
36 at a time building brick roads
Pack your bags and your bendz I am out of here
Too many scold, we ain't riding ever since
New bread, new gun, same attitude
I don't give a fuck and I'm on my latitude
Some real rap words like some young money
My homies with the grown money grind some from me
Verified all my lyrics I get some sip
Whoever tried on my brit it says it's the riff
Throw some fish flake, Tony the tiger quick
I put you in the box too if you complicate

[Hook:]
Bang bang BSB gang you know the name
With the glock I shoot that thing you out the game
Repping for the killers, repping we the realest
Dead motherfuckers we some known drug dealers
Bang bang BSB gang you know the name
With the glock I shoot that thing you out the game
Repping for the killers, repping we the realest
Dead motherfuckers we some known drug dealers
