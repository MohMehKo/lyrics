[Verse 1:]
This my type of party, fiends all in the lobby
G's coming like robbies, dealing dope ain't no hobby
Straight crack no molly
White girl turn holly
Tear drops them foggy, I'm taking souls, minds and bodies
Real life we got bodies, hand guns for them homies
No choppas no hollies, what the fuck I need with all that
Niggas know I'm spitting all facts,
Niggas know my jeep is on map
Niggas know the creep up on that
Niggas know I leave them all flat, pssss

[Hook:]
This girl got a nice taste, that boy will leave them all sloppy
I sell them both and get cake
This my type of party, this my type of party
This my type of party, 20 fiends in the lobby
This my type of party
This girl got a nice taste, that boy will leave them all sloppy
I sell them both and get cake
This my type of party, 20 fiends in the lobby
This my type of party

[Verse 2:]
Got a hunned bands and some change
Never 60 grand worth of cane
That's hoe sell if I'm waiting
No hope to tell you where I'm staying
Them setup games be for real
They mess up things for real
Gotta clap something and high up your crib
Or worst off you get killed
Live forever through these beats, I'm speaking to these streets
It's never dead when it's beef,
Keep your eyes on them don't sleep
Don't put no bitch on no leash
Let them all come to this piece
We all know she a freak, don't be no pussy police

[Hook:]
This girl got a nice taste, that boy will leave them all sloppy
I sell them both and get cake
This my type of party, this my type of party
This my type of party, 20 fiends in the lobby
This my type of party
This girl got a nice taste, that boy will leave them all sloppy
I sell them both and get cake
This my type of party, 20 fiends in the lobby
This my type of party

[Verse 3:]
Now it's about 4: 07 am
I'm tired than a motherfucker, my body hurt
Say how much you say it, tired than a mugger
You know what I mean?
I was working out jogging and shit
Gotta keep my stamina together
When I'm fucking these bitches
Long dick in your bitch nigga
I was fucking this bitch the other day, I got windy though
What the fuck?
Shit felt lil different, you know what I'm saying?
Never in the bitches, you gotta wear your stamina up
In case you gotta square with a nigga in the street
Punch him all in his fucking face
We into the smoking, but you mean really I smoke everything
You know what I mean
I'd be doing 30 years if I'd smoke everything
Other than that, man we just go keep getting this money
I don't do too much talking
I tell niggas the money machine is on it's way
I did say that, only 2 minutes man, I'm a count it, I got you
Real niggas always keep they words
November nigga, got my hoodie on, headphones over the hoodie
While I talk to you niggas
I said this my type of party, Brooklyn nigga, dope boy for real
200% solid gold facts, racks, holler at a nigga, I set you over the pack
Fuck boys, true as nigga, powder.
