[Chorus:]
Awh Man
These niggas
Ain't nothing
But some suckas
And some fake
Real niggas
And it's a Shame

Awh Man
These Bitches
Ain't nothing
But some lying
Ass hoes
That I'm fukin
And it's a Shame

They Talkin Fly
THey GLorify
But I Know it's Lies
Keep that bullshit from round me
They Talkin Fly
THey Glorify
But I Know it's Lies
Keep that bullshit from round me

[Verse 1:]
I wake up
Get dressed
Put my gun on
But no vest
Grind time
Rolex
Paper chase
On your mark set
Real nigga
More or less
Deal giver
I got blow for less
Since hilfiger
I've been photo fresh
Be your self
Who u tryna impress
If the world was sucka free
It would just be me
Me and my niggas
With a couple choice bitches
Who jus fuck
And mind they bizness
No pretenders
Living with us
Time is money
Talk is cheap
And so if life
And I can make you an expense
So watch your feet
Around my toes
I hit the road
To success
And ain't no breaks
Jus my flow
Trunk full of blow
They both mean doe
That's mine for the take
I'm a be great
That's not for debate
You gon be fake
With a heart full of hate
When u seeing my face
You seeing my pace
Real nigga shit
U can't relate

[Chorus:]
Awh Man
These niggas
Ain't nothing
But some suckas
And some fake
Real niggas
And it's a Shame

Awh Man
These Bitches
Ain't nothing
But some lying
Ass hoes
That I'm fukin
And it's a Shame

They Talkin Fly
THey GLorify
But I Know it's Lies
Keep that bullshit from round me
They Talkin Fly
THey Glorify
But I Know it's Lies
Keep that bullshit from round me

[Verse 2:]
You got these fake ass
Fake tits
Fake bag
On a fake bitch
Fake swag
Tryna play rich
Sharing bed rooms
With they're bro or sis
Talkin to me like I don't know
Philippes what
You a wing ho
Popeyes
Kennedys
I am not these niggas in the industry
If the world was sucka free
It would be me and all my bitches
Can't forget my real niggas
Gettin money
Doing bizness
No pretenders
Living with us
Time is money
I don't sleep
Life is cheap
And I will make you an expense
So watch your feet
Around my high top air force 1's
Fake niggas jus force guns
To they head chest
That's man down
BROOKLYN know I don't fuck around
When you outta town be humble
Every hood got it's own jungle
Underestimates
Be for the fakes
While the real relate
To what guns do
Work!

[Chorus:]
Awh Man
These niggas
Ain't nothing
But some suckas
And some fake
Real niggas
And it's a Shame

Awh Man

But I Know it's Lies
Keep that bullshit from round me
