[Verse 1:]
A nigga almost caught a federal charge working that federal job
Got my foot in the door got my niggas involved
Went 4 5 for the week then 6k for a job
I was phoning in gills call me young Steve Jobs
If you coming with 50 we gon' need 10 of that
And if it's over a hundred my nigga you do the math
And they dealing in cash so my niggas buying and cheat
And I was fucking the stewardess my niggas flying for free
Wish I could get more of that but I'm a leave it at that
You crackers came from you boy
Was trying to leave me to rot
Federal investigations had to keep it intact
See I was dodging them bullets like I was Neo and black
Wish I was caught in the Matrix but I'm just stating the facts
They have surveillance and statements and they was dating it back
I wasn't playing with that I got the fuck out of dodge
Told them niggas come and catch me when they placing charge

[Hook:]
And BSB we them gangsters, gangsters, gangsters
Man all you other niggas wanksters, pranksters no thank you
What you sellin huh?
And BSB we them gangsters, gangsters, gangsters
These other niggas they some wanksters, pranksters no thank you
We ain't buying what you sellin

[Verse 2:]
My name Block I'm a dealer out the dope game
And I hang with some niggas out the low game
Me and the streets we got a special romance
I'm on them everyday coughing like an old nigga
Toe toes blow smoke and get dough
Got some glocks with fully extendo
Starts blowing through that cartridge just like playing nintendo
Hear me clearly there's nothing that fear me
Got a chrome tech 9 I suggest you should fear me
Coke rise of pit, Scotty if you don't know
Picky inside the zip, number to let you know
And fuck a microwave I'm old school
With the coffee pot so top doing rag through the string
Drop a ten and talk to traitors how you cap through me
Speak that hit the back don't get out for free
Flip a coin to be turning your faith
Either way fuck you that ass whiping your taste
And don't forget to gank a bust on your face
Straight pass, mad shells, flee pursuing no trace
And don't forget to gank a bust in your face
Straight pass, mad shells, flee pursuing no trace

[Hook:]
And BSB we them gangsters, gangsters, gangsters
Man all you other niggas wanksters, pranksters no thank you
What you sellin huh?
And BSB we them gangsters, gangsters, gangsters
These other niggas they some wanksters, pranksters no thank you
We ain't buying what you sellin

[Verse 3:]
I'm a king on these streets reigning supreme on this bitch
I speak the lingo of bitch when I go in they go preach
Pass a paddle for dough digging dick for the hoes
Money all for bitches and foes put a price on your head and get sow
Bought my hood to the world Troy Ave in this bitch
Bought my rollie with pearl facing this briss
Say it's hot on the lips turn the paper or bricks
Heavy weight on my belts made by Louie and Fen
But my pants still sag 'cause in my pockets is plenty
I protected with sammy all the madic extendi
You be chip to a clip make the movie the emmy
How he pounding in the motherfucker oh MJ
