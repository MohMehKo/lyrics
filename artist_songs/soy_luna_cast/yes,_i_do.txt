Hold me close
Take my hand
Let's be more
Than just friends
All I want
Is to have you with me
When you're here
I feel blessed
Send to god
All my best
Just because
He gave you
All to me

And the sun is shining
And you'll walk with me
I will never run away
Promise I will stay
Here with you

And I will say one day that I do
Give my heart and my whole life to you
We will laugh, we will cry
As the years all pass by
We'll still say
I love you

Smile to me
Makes me smile
Let's just stare for a while
How could I
Live my life without you?
I love you
And those jeans
You're so simple to me
And I love all the things that you do

And you make me dizzy
Make me lose my breath
I adore the way you sing
Never on the key
Sing to me

And I will say one day that I do
Give my heart and my whole life to you
We will laugh, we will cry
As the years all pass by
We'll still say
I love you

And the sun is shining
And you'll walk with me
I will never run away
Promise I will stay
Here with you

And I will say one day that I do
Give my heart and my whole life to you
We will laugh, we will cry
As the years all pass by
We'll still say
That I love you
I love you
