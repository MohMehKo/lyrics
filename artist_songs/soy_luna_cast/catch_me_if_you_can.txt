Let me out the dark
Back to the start
Watching every footstep in front of me
Been chasing fire
Been walking on wire
I see what I wanna see

Going straight to my head, I just cannot pretend
What have you done to me?
I was walking the wall now I'm a free fall

I'm a runaway
Jumping outta planes
Be my parachute, be my parachute
Throw me in the skies
Nothing left to hide
Just two fireflies

Catch me, catch me, catch me if you can
Catch me, catch me, catch me if you can
Catch me, catch me, catch me if you can
Catch me, catch me, catch me if you can

(Catch me, catch me, ca-ca-catch me if you can
Catch me, catch me, catch me-e-e-e if you can
Catch me, catch me, ca-ca-catch me if you can
Catch me, catch me, catch me if you can)

Hanging by a thread
Pushing back the edge
Tracing words you said
Leads me right back to you
Underneath it all
I might trip and fall
But you're my feathered wing
Wouldn't change a thing

Went straight to my heart
Let me outta the dark
What have you done to me?
I was walking the wall now I'm a free fall

I'm a runaway
Jumping outta planes
Be my parachute, be my parachute
Throw me in the skies
Nothing left to hide
Just two fireflies

Catch me, catch me, catch me if you can
Catch me, catch me, catch me if you can
Catch me, catch me, catch me if you can
Catch me, catch me, catch me if you can

Maybe I should hit the ground
Maybe I've been spellbound
But I'm not afraid at all
In my dreams I've reached for this
A leap of faith is worth the risk
But when I am with you I just wanna be free-fallin'

I'm a runaway (I'm a runaway)
(I'm a runaway)
Be my parachute (be my parachute)

I'm a runaway
Jumping outta planes
Be my parachute, be my parachute
Throw me in the skies
Nothing left to hide
Just two fireflies
(Just two fireflies)

Catch me, catch me
Catch me, catch me
(Just two fireflies)
Catch me, catch me
Catch me, catch me
