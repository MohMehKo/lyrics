We used to love
We used to feel it
Said I was everything you needed
And when you kissed me I believed it
That's why I'm hurt so bad

Yeah you got me looking like a fool coming up to you
Whatever happened to the girl that I just knew?
Never thought that you could be, be so cruel
You treated your man like a temporary tattoo
After everything that we've been through
You got me thinking so hard
What did I do?
What did I do?
Yeah yeah yeah

How come it feels like we never happened, never happened at all?
Are you looking at me he he, are you looking at me
Acting like we were nothing, girl we had it all
Are you looking at me he he, are you looking at me
Like a stranger
Like a stranger
Like a stranger

Girl I want you take you along
Don't want you back, just want a reason
Yeah I'm a man and what we had is over
I wish I could get closer
instead of your controller

Yeah you got me looking like a fool coming up to you
Whatever happened to the girl that I just knew
What did I do?
Yeah yeah yeah

How come it feels like we never happened, never happened at all?
Acting like we were nothing, girl we had it all
Like a stranger
Like a stranger
Like a stranger, stranger

Oh no matter what you do
I can never treat you
Like a stranger
Oh no matter what you do
I can never treat you
Like a stranger
Oh what you put me through
I can never treat you
Like a stranger
Oh no matter what you do
No matter what you do

How come it feels like we never happened, never happened at all?
Acting like we were nothing, girl we had it all
Like a stranger
Like a stranger
Like a stranger

Like a stranger
