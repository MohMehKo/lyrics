I'm layin' here trippin'
About the phone conversation that we had last night
Thoughts of skinny dippin'
Said the way you'd put it on me would be wet and tight, yeah

When are you comin' over
It's 8:00 and my mom's gonna be gone at 9
Hit me double-O-seven
I swear that I got your back baby, if you got mine

[1] - Cover me, I'm goin' in deeper
Cover me, I'm goin' in deeper
Cover me, I'm goin' in deeper
Cover me, I'm goin' in deeper

Step into my room, take your clothes off
I got the protection before I break you off
Girl, ain't nothin' to it, the sexin' is the game
Don't only want your body, want your mind just the same

I ain't like the others, this ain't no hit and run
I'm feelin' your romance, Lovin' 101
They way you put it down, your love is so unique
Girl, ain't nothin' jumpin until you cover me, oh

[Repeat 1]

I can't wait 'till I get the chance to love your body
I'm so glad to feel your presence here
You're all the woman that I'll ever need

Let's take our time and do this slow
Just hold on tight and don't let go
Everything's gonna be alright
Cuz mother's doin' double shifts tonight

[Repeat 1]

[Spoken]
Turn all the lights down (Fine daddy)
Come here
You know what I like (Yeah)
Turn it around (Like that?)
Right there, alright
What's my name baby? (Big daddy)

[Repeat 1]
