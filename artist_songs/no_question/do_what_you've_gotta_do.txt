[Verse 1:]

It's been 24 hours 
Since I heard you on the phone 
Pleading with your moms 
Saying can you come back home 

You say you're not happy here 
All we do is fuss and fight 
Said you need to get away 
Cause I don't treat you right 

[Chorus:]

Go on and leave 
Do what you gotta do 
Sorry for the pain and the misery 
I brought to you 
See that you're not happy here 
I'll always be here for you 
If you gotta leave me, girl 
Then do what you gotta do 

[Verse 2:]

See it cuts me like a knife 
To listen to your lies 
After all I've done for you 
You're still not satisfied 

You forgot to tell your mom 
How I treat your kids like mine 
How they're never ever hungry 
And their clothes are made design 
(Go on and leave) 

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge:] 

You know I love you 
And I want you to stay 
'Stead of dealing with your problems 
Feel the need to run away (yeah, yeah) 
I can't hold you if you don't wanna be here 
So I gotta let you go my dear, my dear 

[Repeat Chorus til fade]
