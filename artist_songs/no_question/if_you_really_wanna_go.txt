[Thomas Blackwell] [No Question]
Ooh...yeah, yes 
Oh, oh, oh yeah 
Tell me why you're trippin' 
Wildin' out acting a fool 
You don't have to want for nothing 
'Cuz I made sure that you're cool 
The only thing that matters that you stay honest with me 
(If I had your heart, then who the hell is he) 
Last night you didn't even come home 
I sat out on your steps and called you all night long 
Still good from the depths of my soul 
I can't hold you if you wanna let go...oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

[No Question] [Thomas Blackwell]
If you really wanna go, so long, don't stay (oh yeah, ungh...ungh, oh) 
If you really wanna take your love away (it's gonna be alright) 
(I can't make you stay hey yea) 
If you really wanna go, so long, it's okay (it's your life, well) 
Baby it's your life, oooh....ooh (do what you wanna do) 

[Thomas Blackwell] 
Remember when I met you, your life was a life of love 
I gave your life a reason, you should thank the Lord above 
You've found someone to take your rest and sometimes understand 
Who would hold you next to God and would never raise a hand 
I could've sworn that I made everything alright 
You've gotta man who comes home to you each and every night 
I'm so mad, I just wanna John Blaze 
But if you want it boo, then I can't make you stay, go on and leave me baby 

[No Question] [Thomas Blackwell]
If you really wanna go, so long, don't stay (walk out the door, hey, it's 
gonna be alright) 
If you really wanna take your love away (take your love, take your love away 
hey yeah) If you really wanna go, so long, it's okay (I'm goin' out of my mind 
baby, but it's gonna be okay, it's your life) 
Baby it's your life, oooh...ooh (tell me why, break it down, break it down, 
break it down, down, down) 

[No Question] [Thomas Blackwell]
Tell me what I'm suppose to do now, {now} 
I wish that it could work out somehow, {somehow} 
I laced you up, gave you all my love 
Showed you the game and I raised you up 
Now you say you just wanna bounce (yeah, yeah...yeah) 

[No Question] [Thomas Blackwell]
If you really wanna go, so long, don't stay (oh tell me why) 
If you really wanna take your love away 
If you really wanna go, so long, it's okay 
Baby it's your life, oooh...ooh
