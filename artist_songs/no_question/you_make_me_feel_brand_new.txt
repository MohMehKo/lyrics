My love I'll never find the words my love 
to tell you how I feel my love 
mere words can not explain 
precious love you held my life within your hands 
created everything I am taught me how to live again 

(name n/a) 

Only you cared when I needed a friend (oh) 
believed in me through thick and thin (alright, alright) 
this song is for you filled with gratitude and love 

[chorus]
God bless you (oh, oh) 
you make me feel brand new (ohhhh) 
for God blessed me with you (God blessed me with you) 
you make me feel brand new (alright oh yeah) 
I sing this song for you (oh, yeah) 
make me feel brand new 

[verse two] 

my love whenever I was insecure 
you built me up and made me sure 
you gave my pride back to me 
precious friend, with you I will always have a friend 
or someone who I can depend to walk the path that sometimes bends 

without (without you) 
life has no meaning (my life have no meaning) 
like notes to a song out of time 
how can i repay you for having faith in me.
