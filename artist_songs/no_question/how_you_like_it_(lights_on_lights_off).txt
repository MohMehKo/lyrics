[chorus]
(unh! tell me how you like it baby) with the lights on, or the lights off 
(tell me what you want) how you like your lovin', in the light or in the dark? 
(i got it right here, how you like it how you like it, what you want baby) 
with the lights on, or the light s off 
how you like your loving'? do you like it rough or like it soft? 
(how you like it how you like it) 

[Verse 1]
when the lights are bright, there is no mystery 
I'm looking you in your eyes, while your on top of me 
there are no secrets here, I can see everything 
each way your body turns, you can see the joy it brings 
were making love eye to eye, don't want to even blink 
don't want to miss nothing, I wants some total sync 
you watch me in submission, I finally submit 
just tell me what you want,and I will commit 

[chorus] 

[Verse 2]
when the lights are low, I feel this chemistry 
i feel your every move, and feel your fantasies 
with every kiss you give, I taste what's on your mind 
your looking for the treasure, just seek and you shall find 
were in a universe, that we can call our own 
the moon and stars around us, in this erotic zone 
i sense your sweating sexy, queen of my throne 
which way you want it baby with the lights off or on? 

[chorus]

[bridge]

i like to love you when the rain is coming down 
(dripping wet on top of us, thunder roll and your felling my touch) 
it doesn't matter, long as I hear the sound 
(slip-n-slide natures fly tell me what you want so you can be satisfied) 

[chorus till end]

do you want me like I want you 
let me tease you want to please you 

let me tease you want to please you
