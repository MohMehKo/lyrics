[Verse 1]

your girlfriend told me what it is 
that your trying to handle your bis' 
you got a man waiting for you at home 
but you still trying to get some of this 
she told me everything that you said (said) 
and how it got inside of your head (head) 
you having wet dreams about me 
rollin round in your bed 
so you got me all alone 
tell me face to face 
is it me your thinking about 
taking your mans place

everything you need is here 
so what you wanna do? 

[chorus 2x ]
I'm gonna work it from front to back (whose is this?) 
I'm gonna tap it like I just tap that (whose is this?) 
i bet your man can't work it like that (like that)
