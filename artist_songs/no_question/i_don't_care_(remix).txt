Tell me what the deal is
What's going on?
Why yo peeps don't like me?

They say ain't that one
They say I live life
Jitterbug to the bone

How they gon' talk 'bout me?
Better leave me alone
It's kinda crazy

'Cause they know that your my baby
Tryin' to make ghost like swayze
But you'll forever be my lady

I don't care what your momma say
What you father say
What brother say
I'm gonna love you anywayz

I don't care what your momma say
What you father say
What brother say
I'm gonna love you anywayz

Your peeps say they seen me
Hangin' out in the streets
Swinging with the project ladies
And the ghetto freaks

How they gon' talk bad
'Bout my family
Jojo, Ray-Ray, Keisha
And my cousin Malik

I'm there when you holla
Whatever you need got it
Sure nough' treat you proper
Tryin' to be your baby dada

I don't care what your momma say
What you father say
What brother say
I'm gonna love you anywayz

I don't care what your momma say
What you father say
What brother say
I'm gonna love you anywayz

You never have to worry
I'm gonna be right there
Just put your trust me, yeah

They just don't know me
They can't speak for me
They gotta get to know me, Yeah

I don't care what your momma say
What you father say
What brother say
I'm gonna love you anywayz

I don't care what your momma say
What you father say
What brother say
I'm gonna love you anywayz
