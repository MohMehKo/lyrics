Did you ever love someone so much
That it was bad for you
You'd try to find ways to make 'em happy
And it took control of you
To imagine that someone out there
Don't seem real to you
I finally found someone to roll with
I'm so glad I found you

[1] - I don't wanna be without you
I don't wanna live without you
Baby, I can't breathe without you
I don't wanna go through life walking 
Alone, without you

I don't wanna be without you
Baby, there's no me without you
Don't wanna go through life walking alone

You're the closest one to my heart
This don't seem real to me
When you speak I don't wanna miss one word
Therefore I just don't breathe
I can see you in my future
Being there for me
I pray we'll always be together
You're the strength I need

[Repeat 1]

See love is not an easy task
But we do work it out
You give all you can to your love
So you won't be without
You give all your love and still
It fades away
If at first in love you don't exceed
Just try until your heart believes

[Repeat 1 until fade]
