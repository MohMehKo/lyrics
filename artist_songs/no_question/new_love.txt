I know that he hurt your heart, 
Broke it in a million pieces, 
And left you lonely. 
Cry your eyes into a bloody red color, 
He was your first and only true lover. 
I've told you time and time again, 
You need a man like me. 
Someone who will give you everything, 
And love you endlessly. 

[Chorus:]
You need new love, 
To get you through the lonely heartache. 
You need new love, 
To get you through all the pain. 
You need new love, 
To show you how things could be. 
You need new love, 
Tell me could that new love be me. 

Could it be me? 
Always in the streets slinging with his homies, 
You struggle with your bills and he never has no money. 
Everyone knows he's a liar and a cheat, 
Saw him kissing in movies with a female last week. 
What kind of man would hurt your heart and treat you so cruel. 
You need someone who give everything like you're his one and only jewel 

You need new love, 
To get you through the lonely heartache. 
You need new love, 
To get you through all the pain. 
You need new love, 
To show you how things could be. 
You need new love, 
Tell me could that new love be me. 

How could you let him break you down like it's your fault (it's not your fault). 
I would never do you that way, do you that way, never do you that way. 
If you can't stand the pain, bring that love to a halt. 
Let me take the pain away, your heart will never hurt again. 

You need new love, 
To get you through the lonely heartache. 
You need new love, 
To get you through all the pain. 
You need new love, 
To show you how things could be. 
You need new love, 
Tell me could that new love be me. 

You need new love, 
To get you through the lonely heartache. 
You need new love, 
To get you through all the pain. 
You need new love, 
To show you how things could be. 
You need new love, 
Tell me could that new love be me. 

You don't never ever have to be lonely. 
You don't have to be afraid. 
Cause I plan to give you all of my loving, 
For the rest of my days. 
Let be your everthing baby, 
Everything that you need, 
What I want to know right now. 
Can I be your new love, true love, baby, 
Should be, let it be me.
