You say the only man in your life, that's me
Who pays your bills and give you money, that's me
When you need your hair done, who do you come see

Been coming home late every night, around 3
I'm just trying to figure out, where do you be
We ain't been making love
This don't seem right to me cuz baby 

[1]
I know, all about your late night creep
I know, the guy up in the club that your seeing 
I know, you ain't been out with your crew
Cuz they've been ringing my phone for you

I know, all about your late night creep
I know, the hotel that you're in with him
I know, you ain't been out with your crew
Cuz they've been ringing my phone for you
I know

Don't try to say a word or try to explain
Don't try to tell me you won't do it again
I don't wanna even try 
Baby you know I'm through

Leave the keys to the house and the car, I'm done
Can't believe I thought I was your only one
I don't wanna see you again
Get out, you're dismissed cuz I don't want you 

[Repeat 1]

If luck appears
You insists on playing games
I know that you can just be for the fame
I didn't see it coming so why the pain (Why)
I thought that you would never fly
So how you make me think I was your only guy
I'm not a fool
Now my eyes are open wide

[2]
I know about the guys and the late night creeps
And how you did your thing in between the sheets
They talk about you around town
And how you been messing around

I know about your girls and the whole damn crew
The guy that you took for a rendezvous
I thought your heart was true
And now I'm not messin' with you

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 2]

I know
