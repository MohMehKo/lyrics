Let me tell you about your girlfriend
I know you think that she's your best friend
True blue 'till the very end
I gotta tell ya cuz I can't pretend now

Last night I was all alone
Went to the club just to get it on
She was there in a laced out thong
Clap kissin' and you know she's wrong, yeah

[1] - Private dancer, lady of the street
She always dance every day of the week
She do her thing when she on her creep
For the right price she'll be in your sheets

I hate to tell you but you gotta know
I saw her move to the top of the floor
In 15 minutes she had changed her clothes
Tryin' to play it off like I didn't know

Your girl was the star that night
Everybody got a third that night
A hundred dollars you could take a ride
They got paper but it still ain't right

[Repeat 1]

I can't tell you how to feel
All I know it just ain't right
It just ain't right
I've got to let you know the deal
Gotta let her know leave her bags at the door
Tell her that she won't be dancin for you no more

[Repeat 1 until fade]
