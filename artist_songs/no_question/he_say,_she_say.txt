[Verse 1:] 

What's going on 
You're questioning everything I do 
And everywhere I've been 
You're peeping me off the hook 
Like I am some kind of crook 
Out to take your love away 
Bag it up and go astray 

I wanna know baby 
Who you're talking to 
What you don't know is 
My love is true 

[Chorus:] 

I'm so tired of the he say, she say 
Running 'round hating on me 
I'm so tired of the he say, she say, he say 
This ain't the way that things supposed to be 

I'm so tired of the he say, she say, he say 
Running 'round hating on me 
I'm so tired of the he say, she say, he say 
This ain't the way that things supposed to be (yeah yeah yeah) 

[Verse 2:] 

I'm coming home from my 9 to 5 
I'm working hard to keep this thing alive 
Everything I do, I do for you 
And all you do 
Is give me attitudes 
It's killing me in the worst way 
You're listenin' to what your girlfriends say 
That I'm a dog and I like to play 
What you don't know is 
They wanna take your place 

[Repeat Chorus]


[Bridge:] 

I gave you all the love I had to give 
Did anything for you 
You turned around 
And tell me that it's just not good for you 
And after all the love we shared 
Girl, you should know my love for you is true (my love) 
So tell me what you're gonna do, what you're gonna do 

[Repeat Chorus until fade]
