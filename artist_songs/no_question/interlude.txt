[Man] Hello
[Woman] You ain't no damn good
[Man] Ho, ho, ho, slow down
[Woman] So what you was out gettin' your party on, huh?
[Man] Yeah, I was at the club this weekend
[Woman] Yeah, my parents saw you all up on some gutted check
[Man] Here we go with this "he say, she say" stuff
[Woman] My mom told me you wasn't no good
[Man] What? I know your mom don't like me
But I don't care
[Woman] I just can't trust you no more
[Man] I just can't go on like this, I can't
[Woman] We just need some time apart from each other
[Man] Huh? Well, if you feel like you gotta leave me
Do what you gotta do
