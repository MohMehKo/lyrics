Somebody told you that I've been sleeping around 
because of this lie, you let somebody come along and tears us down 
so you've found yourself a brand new lover but you didn't let me know 
I found out and started going crazy so I had to let you go. 

[chorus] 

I can't stand this living alone 
don't want to come back cause I did you wrong 
(not sure) 
if your what love sent in for the first storm 
darling I love you let me come back home. 

I can't stand this living alone 
don't want to come back home cause I did you wrong 
(not sure) 
if your what love sent in for the first storm 
darling I love you let me come back home. 

[verse two] 

Baby I'm the fool but darling you let me down. 
I know I was wrong for not trusting you, but lady now I'm the clown 
but wasn't I there when your whole damn family turned their back on you 
I was nothing on the day I found you and I'm even less not that I don't have you. 

[chorus] 

[bridge]

Why didn't you come and talk to me we could have worked things out 
after all the things we've been through 
tell me what I'm I suppose to do. 
(now that you have gone away)I never gave you a reason to doubt it 
all I know is I can't live without it 
(no,no,no, won't you come home) 
(I love you soooooooooooo)
