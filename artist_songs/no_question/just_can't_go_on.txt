[Verse 1:]
We've been through so much
and felt so much pain
when I'm going through fire
you're loves like the rain
that's why I need you and
love you so much come hold me
console me girl I need your touch
I never imagine a love so unique
I can hear Angels each time you speak
it feels like heaven there's peace in my life
and when you are here you make things alright
I feel your love running through my veins
there is no life without you
do you feel the same life is to short
so lets not play games
nothing else mattered girl before you came

[chorus:]
Say that you love me girl say that you care
this love is forever you'll always be near
come on with me lets journey on
with out you with me girl I just can't go on
just can't go on

[verse 2:]
Now this might sound crazy it just might sound strange
when I'm alone I'm calling your name (I call your name)
I go through withdrawl when you're away
you are my life line I need to be saved
Send me an angel straight from above
Whose wise as a serpent soft as a dove
sometimes I fall short and I get so weak
but you saw my faults and felt my needs
whenever you're scared and need someone near
I'm right beside you there's no need to fear
I'll be your shoulder whenever you cry
without you with me girl I'll surely die.

[Chorus]

[Hook:]
We might have our strong days
we might even fight but we
struggled for love and everything's alright
what ever it is we wither the storms
I just can't I just can't go on

[Chorus 2x ]
