If there was such a thing as a wish come true
I would wish for you to love me just as much as I love you
And if in life there was just one thing that only I could pray
I would pray for love for you and me
And let the world take the rest
Chocolate girl, oh chocolate girl
Come and play in my ice-cream
Bittersweet cocoa tame
Ooh and cocoa tame
We could live in a chocolate dream
Oh If we could I would wish we could 
Don?t you wish we would
Never grow old and gray

Just be chocolate stars
Make little chocolate bars
And slowly
And slowly
Ooh and slowly
And slowly
And slowly melt away
Slowly melt away [4x]
Chocolate girl
