All I want to do is have a Party
Now's the time, Yours and mine
The night belongs to you
We'll do the town
And see what fun can be found

Can you do the boogie (Boogie)
Can you do the boogie (boogie boogie)
Can you do the boogie (Boogie)
Can you do the boogie (boogie boogie)

Friday rolls around, seems like forever
Saturday slips away, what you gonna do
Come on, you're missing your chance
Forget your cares and dance

Can you do the boogie (Boogie)
Can you (boogie boogie)
Do the boogie (Boogie)
Can you do the boogie (boogie boogie)
(Boogie)
(Boogie Boogie)
(Boogie)
(Boogie Boogie)

Five will get you ten, and Sunday's over
Your head will ache, your knees will shake
It's all for the next weekend
Friday rolls around
There ain't no holding you down

Can you do the boogie (Boogie)
Can you do the boogie (boogie boogie)
Can you do the boogie, boogie (Boogie)
Boogie (boogie boogie)
(Boogie)
Can you do the boogie (Boogie Boogie)
Move It (Boogie)
Move it (Boogie Boogie)

Boogie
