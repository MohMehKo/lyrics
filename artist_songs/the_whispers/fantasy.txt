Wondering if you think of me in your fantasy

And have you ever thought, pretty lady
Just how good it will be?
(Hey)
Hey baby, oh my lady, just you and me

I wanna know just as soon as I can
(Baby, let me know)
The possibility of me being your man

And a love like this where a man
Just loves to hold and squeeze
(You're my kind of woman)

We've got to make this feeling real
Hold it right now, it's only a fantasy
Yeah, my lady

Wondering if you think of me in your fantasy
(Yeah, do you think of me, baby?)

And have you ever thought, pretty lady
Ooh, just how good it will be?
(Hey)
Hey baby, yeah my baby, just you and me

I watched you, baby for a long, long time
Can't hold, stand one day, one day, soon tonight
'Cause you're the kind of woman
That makes a man wanna settle down

(You're my kind of woman)
Time goes on and I'm getting much older
And I'm tired of fooling around
Oh, my lady

Wondering if you think of me in your fantasy
(I'm wondering, you think of me, girl)

I've been watching you, girl
(I got my eyes on you, babe)
I've been watching all the things you do girl
(Watching you all of the time)

Sometimes I need you by my side
(Wanting you, needing you by my side)
Love like this, a pretty lady like you, I'll swallow my pride
(You, for you, you)

I love you babe, I feel you babe
I love the way that you move, oh yeah
