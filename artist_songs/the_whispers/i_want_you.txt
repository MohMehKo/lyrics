Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, ooh

I've been thinking about our situation
We're together but something's wrong
I tried to get you
But you can't find the time to get to me, girl
You like knowing that I hold you
Real tight anytime you need it
Hey, girl
You don't have to watch your back 'round me
Can't you see

I want you
And you know I do, do
You can bet your best on me, darling
And I'll be true to you

At 12:00 we're on the phone
You're calling me and no one's home
I'll bet you're thinking
I found myself another lover, lover
No other
This time dig a little deeper
Before the honey gets sweeter
Hey, girl
You don't have to watch your back 'round me
Can't you see

I want you
And you know I do, do
You can bet your best on me, darling
And I'll be true to you

I want you
And you know I do, do
You can bet your best on me, darling
'Cause I'll be true to you
You, you, you, you, you

True
Bet you're being true, baby
Really true

Bet you're gonna love everything
I do to you, baby
Bet you're gonna love everything
I do to you, girl
Whoa-whoa-whoa

I want you
And you know I do, do
You can bet your best on me, darling
'Cause I'll be true to you

I want you
And you know I do, do
You can bet your best on me, darling
'Cause I'll be true to you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you

Sha-da-do-de-da, baby

Hey, hey, hey
I really, really want you, baby

I want you
And you know I do, do
You can bet your best on me, darling
'Cause I'll be true to you

Last night, the night before
I was knocking, knocking at your door
You were home but wouldn't let me in
Rumors said you were with my best friend

Something's wrong
Hey, girl
Can't you see that I need you
What you say

I want you
And you know I do, do
You can bet your best on me, darling
'Cause I'll be true to you

I want you
And you know I do, do
You can bet your best on me, baby
And I'll be true to you

True
Can't you see it's true, baby
Hey, hey, hey
True

Bet you're gonna love everything that I do
To you
