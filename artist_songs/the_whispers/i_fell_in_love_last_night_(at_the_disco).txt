Well, let's disco down, get on down
Yeah, let's disco down, to the ground
Get up, come on, oww
Alright, get on down, y'all, oww

I didn't mean to fall in love
Fall in love, yeah

I knew I had been through my search
The moment we first touched
And as you held me tight
We danced on through the night

And when I look into your eyes
I became with times, you got me by surprise
Though I only wait to dance
I fell in love last night at the disco

Did I fall in love with you, baby?
Did I fall in love?

Though I tried to go back
She kept on advancing
Until she got me where
I couldn't stop romancing

And though I thought I would have control
Oh, that is not so, a feeling starts to grow
Though I only wait to dance
I fell in love last night at the disco

Did I fall in love with you, baby?
Did I fall in love?

Though I tried to go back
She kept on advancing
Until she got me where
I couldn't stop romancing

And though I thought I would have control
Oh, that is not so, a feeling starts to grow
Though I only wait to dance
I fell in love

Though I only wait to dance
I fell in love
Though I only wait to dance
I fell in love last night at the disco

I fell in love, I fell in love
(Disco, at the disco)
I fell in love, I fell in love
(Disco, at the disco)

Didn't mean to fall in love, I only went to dance
So I made it with the body language, yeah
She made me get on down, she made me get on down
A feeling starts to grow, yeah, come on

Well, let's disco down, get on down
Yeah, let's disco down to the ground
Get up, come on, oww
Alright, to be ashamed
