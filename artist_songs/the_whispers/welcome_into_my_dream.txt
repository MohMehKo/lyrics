In every way you’re part of me
All I am, all I’ll ever be
If I’m weak when I should be strong
You’re my strength to carry on
What’s so wrong with wishing that’s the way it could be 
I wish you were real instead of make believe
(So welcome into my dream, this is my fantasy)
This my fantasy how I wish you were here with me
How I wish you were here with me
(Welcome into my dream, into my dream)
Dreams remind me of all the things I’d miss
Could it be I’ll remain in a fantasy like this
Maybe dreams tell of good things to come
Girl won’t you call today
Don’t let me dream my life away
What’s so wrong with wishing that’s the way it could be (wishing that’s the way it could be)
I wish you were real instead of make believe
(So welcome into my dream this is my fantasy)
This is my fantasy
Girl I wish you were here with me 
(Welcome in to my dream, into my dream)
Ooh ha-haa
[bridge]
Welcome welcome baby (welcome into my dream, this is my fantasy)
Won’t you please come in
I’m in need of your love (welcome in to my dream, into my dream)
Please let it be
So welcome baby into my dream (welcome into my dream, this is my fantasy)
(Welcome into my dream, into my dream)
I’m yours forever, just come to me
