Do you realize
You're the only good thing
That has happened
To me since I've been on my own

Girl will you believe
If I had not met you 
When I met you
Then I would not ever have known

The joy and beauty of
Two people sharing love, that's true
My whole world would have caved in
Girl had it not been for you

Girl you've done so much
To give my life a whole new direction
And much more than these word can say
(Word can say)

So I give you my thanks
And my promise that from now on baby
That we will with each passing day

Know the joy and beauty of
Two people sharing love, that's true
My whole world would have caved in
Girl had it not been for you

Oh 

The joy and beauty of
Two people sharing love that's true
My whole world would have caved in
Girl had it not been for you

Oh baby, the joy and beauty of...
