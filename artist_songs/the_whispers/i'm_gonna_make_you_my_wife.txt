I'm gonna make you my wife
'Cause you're my everything
All my hopes and dreams come true
I can live my life with you

I'm gonna buy you some rings
And everywhere you go
Everyone will know that it's real
What you make me feel

Until there is no more of me
I will try to make you see that I will be
My all and all from here to eternity
Be my world eternally
Will have a child and watch it grow

Cross my heart and hope to die
If I ever make you cry
May I feel the pain that you feel inside
Take the blame if our love should die

I'm gonna make you my world
You be my morning light
The star at night or the air
I breathe

Cross my heart and hope to die
If I ever make you cry
May I feel the pain that you feel inside
And may I take the pain, if our love should die

I gonna make you my song
You'll be my symphony
My rhapsody, my line
You'll be my melody
My harmony, my child

You'll be the air I breathe
The birds and bees, my wife
You be the [?]
