Ooh...ooh...ooh...
Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...

Hey, baby, how have you been
Have you been happy with your so called friend
Tell me do they warm your feet in bed
Work their fingers to the bone to earn your daily bread

Do they turn you on all night till dawn
(Do they turn you on now, do they)
Do they bring out the freak in you and satisfy you like I do
All night long (Do they)

Listen sweet meat, I'm not here to fuss
But I can't let cheap gossip come between us
I'm whispering in one ear, your friends in the other
Please answer me this before your mind gets too cluttered

Do they turn you on all night till dawn
(Do they turn you on now, do they) I said do they
Do they bring out the freak in you and satisfy you like I do
All night long (Do they)

Lady, please try and look ahead
You'll face a cold and empty bed
Girl, stop being misled
Follow your own head, baby

Ooh, go on and use your own mind
Follow the straight and narrow flight of Cupids arrow
That will lead you to me

Do they turn you on all night till dawn
(Do they turn you on now, do they) I said do they
Do they bring out the freak in you and satisfy you like I do
All night long (Do they)

Ooh...hoo...ooh...
I really mean every word I'm about to say to you, baby
All of you that I see pleases me
Every inch of your body to your personality
So undo your hair, babe, while I blow in your ear
Kiss you anywhere that pleases you, dear
And after 6 days of love making, my sweet
On the 7th day I'll rest where your two legs meet

Do they turn you on all night till dawn
(Do they turn you on now, do they) I said do they
Do they bring out the freak in you and satisfy you like I do
All night long (Do they)

Do they kiss away the problems in your lovely, sexy head
(Do they turn you on now, do they)
And after the loving, do they bring you breakfast, lunch and dinner in bed
(Do they, do they really love you like I do)
