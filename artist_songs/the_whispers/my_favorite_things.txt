Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

Cream colored ponies and crisp apple streudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells, schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on the nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt in the spring
These are a few of my favorite things
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite thing

When the dog bites (when the dog bites)
When the bee stings (and when the bee stings)
When I'm feeling sad (feeling sad)
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

My name is Scotty
And my name is Walter
My name is Nick
And my name's Leaveil
Wishing you a Merry Christmas
