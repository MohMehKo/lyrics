She never stayed this lonely 'fore
I know that I was wrong
Been everywhere that she could be
Still can't believe she's gone

I'm so afraid she won't return
And that will blow my mind
But if she does, I'll treat her right
And things will be just fine

You never miss your water 'til your well runs dry
I feel so bad, I could cry
(You know)
You never miss your water 'til your well runs dry
I feel so bad, I could cry

Another chance is all I need
We'll be alright this time
O Lord above, please hear my prayer
My baby, I must find

I'm all alone and now I notice
What she's been to me
I'll never find another girl
As wonderful as she

You never miss your water 'til your well runs dry
I feel so bad, I could cry
(I'll say)
You never miss your water 'til your well runs dry
I feel so bad, I could cry

One more chance is all I need
We'll be alright this time
O Lord above, please hear my prayer
My baby, I must find

I'm all alone and now I know
What she's been to me
I'll never find another girl
As wonderful as she

You never miss your water 'til your well runs dry
I feel so bad, I could cry
(Don't you know)
You never miss your water 'til your well runs dry?
I feel so bad, I could cry

(You better belive)
You never miss your water 'til your well runs dry
I feel so bad, I could cry
(Now I see)
You never miss your water 'til your well runs dry
I feel so bad, I could cry

(Got to find, got to find, got to find my baby)
You never miss your water 'til your well runs dry
I feel so bad, I could cry
(We're gonna be alright this time)
You never miss your water 'til your well runs dry
I feel so bad, I could cry
