Did something change, I don't really care anyway
You can go write something about it
Sure, I like it, I like what you write about me
I'm insane, you said I don't feel the same when you're gone
Oh, driving in here when your heads so numb
I have nothing to say about anyone

My mistake, I made this about me
And wrapped you around me like a blanket
I hate it, I hate myself

Guess I was wrong, I was mean
I created such a scene
And my demons within
But I'm changing

Did something change, I don't really care anyway
You can go write something about it
Sure, I like it, I like what you write about me

Either way... I'm just another stone in the ground
I'm not someone that you come looking for
I'm just somebody you found
Oh, I think I need my family 'round
I'm standing on my head and the world is upside down
I guess it's still turning

Guess I was wrong, I was mean
I created such a scene
And my demons within
But I'm changing
