Leon I'm smart
I got myself a good guy
Oh Leon when she broke your heart
You got yourself a good gun

Oh Leon, he had a daughter
And when I saw her, I could see his son
I wish your kissing never felt so boring
There must be something more than that

What is going on, I got it wrong
I hadn't figured out until you were gone, Leon, Leon
Take her back into your arms, send her flowers, what she wants
Laugh about it and move on

Leon it's all going wrong
I'm stuck within this lie
You say you'd die before you were gone
But when we fucked, it was alright

Oh I love to watch it when you fight
And when your kiss her well I saw right through
I know what we had in mind

Well it was going on, I got it wrong
I hadn't figured out until you were gone, Leon, Leon
Take her back into your arms, send her flowers, what she wants
Laugh about it and move on

Leon is so slow
Another person comes and goes
Is it enough to keep you coming around?
And Leon is so slow
I used to hate watching you go
I love the feeling just before you go down

And Leon is so slow
Another person comes and goes
Sitting also keep you coming around
And Leon is so slow
I used to hate watching you go out
I love the feeling just before you go down
