Heart in my hand
We've broken the bread
And I choked on a thread
Again and again

Fist in a botch
My arms as they haul
Away from your body
Away from your skin

You see, that's my twin
She's standing aside and she's my next of kin
If only you knew what resided within

[Chorus:]
I won't let her in
That would be callous and crass
A chip on my chin
You didn't want me back

Stark in the dirt
Can you tell that she's hurt?
So sharp and alert
She's such a clean breathe

Starting to emerge
I'm a ghost that I was
A sister of her
And I'm all the same creed

I'll never give in
How could I apprise you with all that she's sinned
She feels like hell and I know 'cause I've been

[Chorus 2x]
