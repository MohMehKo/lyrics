From the movements you made
And the soft gaze you gave
You understood
Ooh, ooh

And I knew it wouldn't last
But in the clean light you cast
I was good
I was good

From the movements you made
And the soft gaze you gave
You understood
Ooh, ooh

And I knew it wouldn't last
But in the clean light you cast
I was good
I was good

And no matter what I do, I know you got me, girl

From the movements you made
And the soft gaze you gave
You understood
Ooh, ooh

And I knew it wouldn't last
But in the clean light you cast
I was good
I was good

All the years my soul, all the things you thought I did
This soulless kid was under all my skin
All the things I tried to say remain within
I'm cooling in the clay
I've always been molded this way

All the years my soul, all the things you thought I did
This soulless kid was under all my skin
All the things I tried to say remain within
I'm cooling in the clay
I've always been molded this way
