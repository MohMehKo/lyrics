You go out and have your fun with my head in mine and my heart in your hands
You said you're looking for someone who doesn't take one look and understand

I get such a rush with my head out the window
Flying past your love
You learned how to let go
Oh I'm changing
Crazed and cradling what I've bathed in

The window
The window
Just let go
The window
Just let go
The window

I was raw and sick and thin, it wasn't hard to let my head cave in
It's easy feeling things with flys and staying wild while I'm just a child

I get such a rush with my head out the window
Flying past your love
You learned how to let go
Oh I'm changing
Crazed and cradling what I've bathed in back then

Just let go
The window
Just let go
Oh head out
The window

Oh I'm fading
Crazed and cradling pools to bathe in
