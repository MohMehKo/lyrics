I'm still burned and my blood it creeps
I'm the sun-flooded mouth and I can not speak
I'm the scars upon your knees
I'm the scrapes of iron your skin breathes
I could be anything

[Refrain:]
And it was so brief
A kick in the teeth
Oil and powdered lungs
Because I know how to breathe
And it was so brief
One more time for luck
And then I go home

You're the movements in my sleep
You are the words I couldn't keep
I saw the fumes and watched them seep
Into the wounds, you bare to bleed
I could lose everything

[Refrain]

You love
When I saw you
You love
When I saw you
You love
When I saw you
You love
When I saw you
