I could have you up in arms
And I could have you singing
I'm a confident speaker
I could tell you anything

I was standing on the table
Legs by the light right near the window
I could see them walking past
They were laughing
No one we know

Ooooh
Ooooh
Ooooh

They caught me by the ankles and they shook me out
My brain is fuzzy
I'm a sugar coated pill and I'm a pick me up
And put me down again

They hollowed me out
Wore me like a glove
So many hands
I've been dreaming of

You could use my rib cage as a pillow
It doesn't suit me
I feel flimsy when I grin
Like a stretched out piece of skin

Beat the dust straight out of me
I'll come clean in the end
Really I like the yellow 'round the edges
Of my bruises as they mend

Ooooh
Ooooh
Ooooh

They caught me by the ankles and they shook me out
My brain turned fuzzy
I'm a sugar coated pill and I'm a pick me up
And put me down again

They hollowed me out
Wore me like a glove
So many hands
I've been dreaming of
