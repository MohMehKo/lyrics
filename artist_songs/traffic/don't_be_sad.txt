Don't be sad, I just want to see you get through
All I have, it's yours if you think it helps you
Good or bad, there's no one can really judge you
You just have to come to your own conclusion
There is only one who means more than all to me
And through the lady, in a dream I've learned to live with everyone
Mother, father, all my friends, have seen me have my day
But now I see that there's no need in trying to run, though it's been fun
