Sittin' here thinkin' of my love
Sittin' here thinkin' of my love
Wonderin' if she's thinking, or maybe if she's drinking
Sittin' here just thinkin' of my love

Never felt as low as this before
Never felt as low as this before
In the evening when I'm sleeping
When I wake up I'm weeping
Never felt as low as this before
No, I never felt as low as this before

Sittin' here thinkin' of your love
Sittin' here thinkin' of your love
Wonderin' if it's growing since we both stopped cryin'
Sittin' here just thinkin' of your love

Never felt this way before
Never felt inseparable for sure
In the evening I am sleeping
When I wake up I'm weeping
Never felt inseparable before
No, I've never felt inseparable before
