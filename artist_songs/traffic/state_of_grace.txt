Sometimes your life can be sidetracked, getting lost in things you don't need
But we all lose direction in a world of greed
Some people's lives end in ruin, some people's lives never start
Someone knows what you're doing deep in your heart

In the hour of need you stood ready, looked danger right in the face

Your heart is moved by the spirit when you're living
Living in a state of grace

There's a world never ending, sorrow and pain don't exist
We can live there together, you can't resist

Just when you think you can't take it, dreams disappear into space
Trust in your heart, you can make it, when you're living
Living in a state of grace

There's nothing worse than the sorrow of loved ones you have lost
You can't face tomorrow, you can't bear the cross
But just remember that darkness in this world has no place
You've got so much to give now
