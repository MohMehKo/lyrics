Well, my temp'rature's risin' and my feet on the floor,
Twenty people knockin' 'cause they're wanting some more,
Let me in, baby, I don't know what you've got,
But you'd better take it easy, this place is hot
So glad we made it, so glad we made it
You gotta gimme some lovin', gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin' every day.

Well, I feel so good, ev'rything is sounding hot,
Better take it easy, 'cause the place is on fire,
Been a hard day and I don't know what to do,
Wait a minute, baby, it could happen to you.

So glad we made it, so glad we made it
You gotta gimme some lovin', gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin' every day. 

Well, I feel so good, ev'rybody's gettin' high,
Better take it easy, 'cause the place is on fire
Been a hard day, nothin' went too good,
Now I'm gonna relax, honey, ev'rybody should

So glad we made it, so glad we made it
You gotta gimme some lovin', gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin' every day
