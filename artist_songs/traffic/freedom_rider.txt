Like a hurricane around your heart
When earth and sky are torn apart
He comes gathering up the bits
While hoping that the puzzle fits
He leaves you
He leaves you
Freedom rider

With a silver star between his eyes
That open up at hidden lies
Big man crying with defeat
See people gathering in the street

When lightning strikes you to the bone
You turn around, you're all alone
By the time you hear that siren sound
Then your soul is in the lost and found
Forever
Forever
Freedom rider

Here it comes
