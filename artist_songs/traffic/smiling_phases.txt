Do yourself a favor
Wake up to your mind
Life is what you make it
You see but still your blind
Get yourself together, give before you take
You'll find out the hard way
Soon you're going to break

Smiling Phases, going places
Even when they bust you
Keep on smiling through and through
And you'll be amazed at the gaze on their faces
As they sentence you

You don't need a lawyer
When you're in a fix
Someone gets the pay off
You're friends are full of tricks
How could you love something
That you just can't buy?
Own up to the truth girl
Your mother's gone on by

Your companion, brings you flowers
You just hang him up
And keep him waiting there for hours
And you should just see the look on his face 
As you slide down the rail
