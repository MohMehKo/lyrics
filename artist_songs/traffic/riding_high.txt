Don't be afraid, love, when the storm comes
We're gonna make it through on our own
Don't you, don't you ever let go of my love
Think about it, if you believe then it will be

We'll be riding high and we won't look down
See our spirits flying to that higher ground

Over and over, oh, the storm raged
I held you in my arms to keep you warm
No, you, no, you never let go of my love
Through the darkness you were the light that shone on me

Now we're Riding High yeah and we don't look down with our spirits flying to the higher ground 

Every step I took, through everything I've done

When the lightning struck you were the only one
you were the only one
you were the only one
oh 
No you 
no you never let go of my love 
through the darkness 
you are the light that shines on me 

Now we're riding high yeah 
and we dont look down with our spirits flying to that higher ground 
we're riding high yeah 
and we dont look down with our spirits flying to that higher ground we're riding high yeah 
and we dont look down with our spirits flying to that higher ground 

[repeat chorus]
