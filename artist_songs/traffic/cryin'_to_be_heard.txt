Somebody's cryin' to be heard
And there's also someone
Who hears every word

Sail across the ocean
With your back against the wind
Listening to nothing save
The calling of a bird
And when the rain begins to fall,
Don't you start to curse
It may be just the tears
Of someone that you never heard

Somebody's cryin' to be heard
And there's also someone
Who hears every word

Reflected in the water
Is a face that you don't know
And isn't it surprising
When you find out it's your own?
And so you try to find out
Whether it is friend or foe
And what it wants to know,
And what it wants to know

Somebody's cryin' to be heard
And there's also someone
Who hears every word

Well, you're wrapped up in your little world
And no one can get in
You sit and think of everything then
You wonder where you've been
You put the blame on someone
That you've hardly ever known
And then you realize too late
The blame was all your own

Somebody's cryin' to be heard
And there's also someone
Who hears every word

Sail across the ocean
With your back against the wind
Listening to nothing save
The calling of a bird
And when the rain begins to fall,
Don't you start to curse
It may be just the tears
Of someone that you never heard

Somebody's cryin' to be heard
And there's also someone
Who hears every word
