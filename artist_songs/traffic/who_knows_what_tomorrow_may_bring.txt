We are not like all the rest, you can see us any day of the week
Come around, sit down, take a sniff, fall asleep
Baby, you don't have to speak
I'd like to show you where it is but then it wouldn't even mean a thing
Nothing is easy, baby, just please me, who knows what tomorrow may bring?
If for just one moment you could step outside your mind
And float across the ceiling, I don't think the folks would mind
