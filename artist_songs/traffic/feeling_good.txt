Bird flying in the sky, you know how I feel
Sun shinin' in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze drifting on by, that's what I mean
It's a new dawn
It's new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feelin' good
Bird flying high and you know how I feel
Sun up in the sky, you know how I feel
(?), that's what I mean
It's a new dawn
It's new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feelin' good
Dragonfly out in the sun, you know how I feel
Butterflies all having fun, you know how I feel
Sleep in peace when day is done, that's what I mean
It's a new dawn
It's new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feelin' good
Birds flying in the sky, you know how I feel
Sun shinin' in the sky, yes, you know, you know how I feel
(?), you know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's new day
It's a new life for me
Oh yes, and I'm feelin'
Oh yes, and I'm feelin'
Oh yes, and I'm feelin' good
