Blind man
Standing on the corner
Crying out the blues
And I don't need a dollar
And don't give me a dime
Until you bring back that little girl of mine
I can't let her go
I'm hooked I can't let her go
People try to tell me stop crying
And find you someone new
'Cause when that good Lord made one woman
Halleluja!
Don't you know he made two
But I can't let her go
I'm hooked I can't let her go
I can't let her go Lord
I can't let her go
He lifted up his head toward heaven
And said, Lord, I'd rather die
Then let a no-good woman
Make me stand on this corner and cry
Lord knows I'm living in a world of darkness
But that don't bother me
And until I find that sweet little girl of mine
Lord knows, I just don't want to see
I can't let her go
I'm hooked I can't let her go
Won't somebody please help the blind
I can't let her go
