See that girl right there
They say she's sexy as hell
Cause when she glides into a room
All her presence is felt.
Its like she's insatiable, irresistible
I know that I can get her 
And I won't even try
Cause she gave me that look
Like I'm the type of guy
That knows how to please her
Knows just what she needs

(But I....)
I know I'm dreaming she's in love with me
But in reality, she's a one night machine
(And I....)
I know she doesn't fall in love at all.
Love is all I need.
And I don't ca ca care about
(the price of company)
Love is all I need.
And I don't ca ca care about
(the price of company)

Its intentional, she
Can be so persuadable
But please believe me
She tells her time
With dollars and cents
I am the clock that pays the rent
Dressed to kill, she's taking all my will.

(And I....)
Can't stop, want it all
I'm sure before.
This love is all I need.
And I don't ca ca care about
(the price of company)
Love is all I need.
And I don't ca ca care about
(the price of company)

Love is all I need.
And I don't ca ca care about
(the price of company)
Love is all I need.
And I don't ca ca care about
(the price of company)

There's a devil to left
An angel to my right
She's been running circles
All around my mind
With a body like that,
Who could say no?
She'll leave with my money
And my self control
