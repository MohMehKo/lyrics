You know reactions speak louder than words.
Thought we were past that,
forget what you heard.
Pay no attention.
Better to shut out the light,
than to find yourself at home all alone
thinkin' of me tonight.

Problems won't disappear.
When I look you in the eye,
something isn't right.
Problems will interfere
and I don't think we'll survive.

A fall from up so high,
the tears drop,
waiting for the fallout.
This must be the way down.

It won't stop,
everything a blur now.
This must be the way down.

Everything was bound to change.
Now I know I could've saved us.
This must be the way down.

Everything was perfect,
till the train went right off the rail.
Like we were passed out,
asleep at the wheel.
When you know you've lost it,
there's no one in control.
And you will find yourself too high.
Better just try letting go.

Problems won't disappear.
When I look you in the eye,
something isn't right.
Problems will interfere
and I don't think we'll survive.

A fall from up so high,
the tears drop,
waiting for the fallout.
This must be the way down.

It won't stop,
everything a blur now.
This must be the way down.

Everything was bound to change.
Now I know I could've saved us.
This must be the way down.

Now that the smoke is gone,
I can see that I'm all alone.
Forever has been long enough.
I need you to come back home.

The tears drop,
waiting for the fallout.
This must be the way down.

It won't stop,
everything a blur now.
This must be the way down.

Everything was bound to change.
Now I know I could've saved us.
This must be the way down.

We're on the way...
We're on the way...
We're on the way...
