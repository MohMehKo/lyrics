What if I fall along the way
Would you be there...

So you heard, that I'm on my way
Wish that I didn't have to say
Goodbye. I'll rely on your faith in me.

I got my feet on the ground
But my head's in the clouds
Can't forget where I come from
I hope your there when I'm done
I got my feet on the ground
But my head's in the clouds
Can't forget where I come from
I hope your there when I'm...

What If I fall along the way would
You be there to ease the pain?
It's my one shot can't fuck it up
And throw it away. Won't be long.
Won't be long before I break.

It's the touch, and the taste
It's the feel of a brand new place
When I go, you'll be there,
In a month in a year.

I got my feet on the ground
But my head's in the cloud
Can't forget where I come from
I hope your there when I'm done
I got my feet on the ground
But my head's in the clouds
Can't forget where I come from
I hope your there when I'm...

What If I fall along the way would
You be there to ease the pain?
It's my one shot can't fuck it up
And throw it away. Won't be long.
Won't be long before I break.

So you think that I am wasting my time
But I'm ready, ready to go.
So you know I've got this under control
But I'm ready...

What if I fall before along the way would you be there
To ease the pain? Cause it's my one shot
Can't fuck it up and throw it away, won't be long...

What If I fall along the way would
You be there to ease the pain?
It's my one shot can't fuck it up
And throw it away. Won't be long.
Won't be long before I break.
