You look better when I'm drunk
You look better,
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better

It's the right night
To make the wrong moves gotta
Bad case and nothing to lose
When the
Lights out we have an excuse,
Is this romance
Or is it the juice?

I might be crazy but I think
Tonight has only begun (gun, gun)
Your not my normal type
But we can make an exception (on, on)

A little less thinkin' and a lot more drikin
That'll work for me tonight (oh, oh)
When the room starts spinnin'
And we start sinnin'
I begin to realize

You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better... drunk,
You look better... drunk,
You look better when I'm
Drunk-drunk-drunk-drunk

It's a-bout time I learn my lesson but this
Lesson is under my skin it's a
New night a new location so I
Wait for the buzz to kick in

I might be crazy but I think
Tonight has already done (done, done)
Your not my normal type
But we can make an exception (on, on)

A little less thinkin' and a lot more drikin
That'll work for me tonight (oh, oh)
When the room starts spinnin'
And we start sinnin'
I begin to realize

You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better... drunk,
You look better... drunk,
You look better when I'm
Drunk-drunk-drunk-drunk

Hey DJ spin the soundtrack
To bad decisions
And these drinks, make me,
Lose my self control
Hey DJ spin the soundtrack
To bad decisions
And these drinks, make me,
Lose my self control

(That's why)

You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better... drunk,
You look better... drunk,
You look better when I'm
Drunk-drunk-drunk-drunk
