Come on baby take it home
People are starting to stare
And they're turning off all of the lights
We've been putting on a show all ni-i-i-ight

Boys will be boys

[Chorus:]
Take it home take it home
Cause i can't take anymore
It's your touch it's your taste
It's your dress on the floor
Take it home take it home
Cause I've been waiting all night
For you
And this is what I'm gonna do

[Bridge:]
Ice ice melt your heart
Baby girl let down your guard
Rush rush for that touch
Just one taste can't get enough [x2]

Baby put your key in the door
Cause this party's getting way to loud
And the neighbors can't take anymore
And they're so for you
Let's give them an encore

Boys will be boys

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

Get a room, and they say
What's it to them anyway
Over there, anywhere
Doesn't matter cause your here

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

Just one taste can't get enough

[Chorus]

Just one taste can't get enough
