In the grove, when your cup seemed too much
With the worst yet to come
I was on your mind
On the cross, as the crowds cursed your name
Heaven's eyes turned away
Still you thought of me

I know you love me so

Through it all, you were thinking of me
Even death couldn't keep all your love from me
But you died, so that I could have life
There's no greater love than this

I know you love me so [x2]

Your love is still the same
Beginning and forever
I sing of all your passion won for me
I sing of all your love first done in me
Your love will never change
Beginning and forever
I sing of all your passion won for me
I sing of all your love first done in me

I found you [x6]

You're brighter than the sun
Risen from the shadows
Seated on the throne of majesty
Higher than the skies and all we see
[x2]

I found you [x6]

I love you [x6]
