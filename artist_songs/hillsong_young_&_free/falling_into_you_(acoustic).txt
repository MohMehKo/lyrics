I lived my life to the limit
Where I met the end of myself
I see the edge but I know below me
Your love is waiting to catch

I want to love You like You love me
I want to love You like You love me

I'm falling into you
'Cause no one's gonna love me like You do, alright
I've got nothing to loose
So I can't stop won't stop falling into You, alright
Alright, yeah

The rush I've felt in the free-fall
As I lost control of my life
O Jesus I've found that You've always had me
Your love is never in doubt

I want to love You like You love me
I want to love You like You love me
Ohh yeah

I'm falling into you
'Cause no one's gonna love me like You do, alright
I've got nothing to loose
So I can't stop won't stop falling into You, alright
Alright

I wanna love you like you love me
I wanna love you like you love me
I wanna love you like you love me
I wanna love you like you love me
Yeah, yeah

All the time I want to
Oh just fall right into
Oh yeah, yeah

I'm falling into you
'Cause no one's gonna love me like You do, You do, yeah
I've got nothing to loose
So I can't stop won't stop falling into You, my God
Oh my God
'Cause no one's gonna love me like You do, alright
I've got nothing to loose
So I can't stop won't stop falling into You, alright
Alright

That's all I want to do
Oh just fall right into You
Ohh that's all I want to do!
Ohh that's all I want to do
