This is no performance
Lord I pray it's worship
Empty words I can't afford
I'm not chasing feelings
That's not why I'm singing
You're the reason for my song

And I only wanna sing
If I sing with everything
If I sing for You my King
And I can't imagine why
I would do this all for hype
'Cause it's all to lift You high
Woah

You don't want perfection
Just my soul's attention
So all I have is what I'll give
More than a song that lasts a moment
I'll live a life full of honest worship
If I'm here to sing then I'll sing with purpose
All the praise, Lord, You deserve it

I only wanna sing
If I sing with everything
If I sing for You my King
Woah
I can't imagine why
I would do this all for hype
'Cause it's all to lift You high
Woah

I only wanna sing
If I sing with everything
If I sing for You my King
Woah
I can't imagine why
I would do this all for hype
'Cause it's all to lift You high
Woah
