You've overcome this world with love
And made my fight Your own
I lift my eyes and throw fear aside
And sing out into the night
Oh, sing out into the night

Even when the world caves
Even when the fight calls
Even when the war's wage
I'll take heart
I know You are greater
Forever You are Savior
I will sing Your praise
With all that I have
With all that I am Lord

I'll stare down the waves
Cause You own the tide
I still my soul and know
You wait for me
On waters wild
Where faith walks above the storm

'Cause even when the world caves
Even when the fight calls
Even when the war's wage
I'll take heart
I know You are greater
Forever You are Savior
I will sing Your praise
With all that I have
With all that I am Lord
With all that I have
With all that I am Lord

I won't let the storm weather my heart
Won't let the darkness beat me down
Sing in the night, my hope alive in You
I'll walk through the fire and not be burned
Pray in the fight and watch it turn
Jesus, tonight, I give it all to You

I won't let the storm weather my heart
Won't let the darkness beat me down
Sing in the night, my hope alive in You
I'll walk through the fire and not be burned
Pray in the fight and watch it turn
Jesus, tonight, I give it all to You

I won't let the storm weather my heart
Won't let the darkness beat me down
Sing in the night, my hope alive in You
I'll walk through the fire and not be burned
Pray in the fight and watch it turn
Jesus, tonight, I give it all to You

Woah, woah
Woah, woah

Woah, woah
Woah, woah

'Cause even when the world caves
Even when the fight calls
Even when the war's wage
I'll take heart
I know You are greater
Forever You are Savior
I will sing Your praise
With all that I have
With all that I am Lord
