You came to earth that You created
You walked beneath the stars You named
You came from heaven holding freedom
Jesus Christ the Lord our God

I'm gonna sing until my voice won't let me
As thunders roar I'll shout Your praise

You authored life and wrote Yourself in
You dwelt in time that You designed
Creator lived in His creation
Completely man completely God

I'm gonna sing until my voice won't let me
As thunders roar I'll shout Your praise
You're the God of everlasting wonder
Your love outlasts the end of days

I'll lift Your Name higher and higher
I'll sing Your praise louder and louder
Your love goes deeper and deeper
You reign forever and ever
[x2]

I'm gonna sing until my voice won't let me
As thunders roar I'll shout Your praise
You're the God of everlasting wonder
Your love outlasts the end of days
[x2]

Your love it lasts forever
Oh, Your love

I'll lift Your Name higher and higher
I'll sing Your praise louder and louder
Your love goes deeper and deeper
You reign forever and ever
[x4]

I'm gonna sing until my voice won't let me
As thunders roar I'll shout Your praise
You're the God of everlasting wonder
Your love outlasts the end of days
[x2]
