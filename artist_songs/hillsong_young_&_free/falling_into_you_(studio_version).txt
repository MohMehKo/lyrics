I lived my life to the limit
Where I met the end of myself
I see the edge but I know below me
Your love is waiting to catch

I'm falling into you
Cause no one's gonna love me like you do
I've got nothing to lose
So I can't stop, won't stop falling into you

The rush I've felt in the free-fall
As I lost control of my life
Jesus, I've found that
You've always had me
Your love is never in doubt

I wanna love you like you love me
I wanna love you like you love me

I'm falling into you
Cause no one's gonna love me like you do
I've got nothing to lose
So I can't stop, won't stop falling into you

I wanna love you like you love me
I wanna love you like you love me

I wanna love you like you love me
I wanna love you like you love me

I'm falling into you
Cause no one's gonna love me like you do, you do, yeah
I've got nothing to lose
So I can't stop, won't stop falling into you
My God, my God
Cause no one's gonna love me like you do
I've got nothing to lose
So I can't stop, won't stop falling into you

Alright, alright
I'm falling into you
I'm falling into you, my God
I'm falling into you
I'm falling into you
I'm falling into you
