[Verse 1:]
When it doesn't go my way
I know that it is not the end
I'm trusting you have better plans
I haven't even dreamt of yet

[Pre-Chorus:]
I know that You are for me
When everything's against me
I put all my hope in You

[Chorus:]
Jesus I will trust You
I will trust you
I know you never fail
I will trust you
Jesus I will (I will)
Jesus I will (I will)

[Verse 2:]
I don't know how the story ends
But I know that You finished it
I'll close my eyes and just let go
And fall into my only Hope

[Pre-Chorus:]
There's safety in the falling
When I surrender fully
I put all my hope in You

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
The only thing I know
Is God you're in control
In every little detail
You are close
I'll never be alone
Here in the unknown
The power of Your Presence
Fills my soul

Now everything I know
Is God you're in control
In every little detail
You are close
I'll never be alone
Here in the unknown
The power of Your Presence
Fills my soul

[Chorus]
