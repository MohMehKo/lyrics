[Aodhan Toggs:]
Skylines and crowded streets
Calling my attention
The limelight and empty dreams
Craving my affections
But there is a perfect voice
Waiting above the noise
Jesus, my only choice
When all the lights are screaming

[Aodhan King & Laura Toggs:]
Then I, I get lost in Your eyes
And find a clarity to life
The world and all the colours rage
But I'm not gonna look away, no
I, I get lost in Your eyes

I've read all their glossy guides
To living in contentment
I've heard all the pretty lies
And all of them are vacant
But You are a love unique
My heart, my identity
Jesus You're all I need
I see the rest as nothing

Then I, I get lost in Your eyes
And find a clarity to life
The world and all the colours rage
But I'm not gonna look away, no
I, I get lost in Your eyes

Ooh, I get lost in Your eyes
Ooh, I get lost in Your eyes
Ooh, I get lost in Your eyes
I get lost in Your eyes
I get lost in Your eyes

I get lost in Your eyes
I get lost in Your eyes
And find a clarity to life
The world and all the colours rage
But I'm not gonna look away, no
I, I get lost in Your eyes
