You shine brighter
Than any star in the sky
Your light shining
Through the dark of the night
Jesus forever
I find all that I am in Your love love love

You are with me
In every step that I take
Your love for me
You have called me by name
Jesus forever
I find all that I am in Your love love love

Let the music play
Hear us praise Your Name
See the darkness fade
Dance the night away
We have found our place
In the Saviour's grace
Dance the night away
Your light is taking over me

I find freedom
In the light of Your love
Everlasting
You are more than enough
Jesus forever
I find all that I am in Your love love love

Let the music play
Hear us praise Your Name
See the darkness fade
Dance the night away
We have found our place
In the Saviour's grace
Dance the night away
Your light is taking o-o-over me
Your light is taking o-o-over me
I'm dancing cause Your love has set me free
Your light is taking o-o-over me

All of my heart and soul to You alone
You are the One I want now forever
All of my heart is Yours forevermore
You are the One I want now forever

All of my heart and soul to You alone
You are the One I want now forever
All of my heart is Yours forevermore
You are the One I want

Let the music play
Hear us praise Your Name
See the darkness fade
Dance the night away
We have found our place
In the Saviour's grace
Dance the night away

Your light is taking o-o-over me
I'm dancing cause Your love has set me free
Your light is taking o-o-over me
