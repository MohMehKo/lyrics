You are the only one in my head
I've chosen you now my heart is set
Your love forever and is my strength, my strength

More than a rush of adrenaline
You will sustain me until the end
You are the only one
You are the only one

When you speak dreams and reality collide
Your word rewrites my destiny
My life finds a new beginning
Cause you are, you are my energy

Jesus your presence is what ignites
Your truth is electric the source of light
A moment with you makes me come alive, alive

When you speak dreams and reality collide
Your word rewrites my destiny
My life finds a new beginning
Cause you are, you are my energy

Jesus you’re everything I need and more
I’ll follow you til the end
You are my strength
Jesus you’re everything I need and more
You are, you are my energy

You’re the everlasting God
You’re the one who holds it all
I can’t help but stand in awe
You are my energy
[2x]

When you speak dreams and reality collide
Your word rewrites my destiny
My life finds a new beginning
Cause you are, you are my energy

Jesus you’re everything I need and more
I’ll follow you til the end you are my strength
Jesus you’re everything I need and more
You are, you are my energy

You are my energy
