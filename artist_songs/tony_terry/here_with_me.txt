My wish just sitting here
Thinking how it is when we're together
And remembering the days
And remembering the nights

Let's get on

I know I did you wrong
When I left you all alone
I know you love me true
That's why I'm saying this words to you

I need you here with me
Darling, can't you see?
I need you here
Oh yes I, come on and set me free

I've waited all this time
I knew, I couldn't leave you behind
It's time to take a stand
I need you here where I am

I need you here with me
Darling, can't you see?
I need you here with me
Oh yes I do, do the
Come on and set me free

Remembering the days
Remembering the nights
With you baby
Darling, can't you see?

I need you here with me
Oh yes, I do, baby
Come on and set me free

You bring sunshine into my life
Yes, you do
Remembering the days
Remembering the nights, babe
You bring sunshine into my life
Yes, you do

I need you
I need you
I need you
Yes, I do

Remembering the days
Remembering the nights
I need you
I need you
I need you
Yes, I do

I need you here with me
Darling can't you see?
I need you here with me
Oh sugar, come on and set me free

[?]
If I did my way
I don't even need no desperation
To brighten up my day

Remembering the days
Remembering the nights, babe

Remembering the days
Remembering the nights
Sugar, sugar
