Time has turned against us,
On this day
Plans are not in favour,
When I'm away

I know you're something special
I know you're something good
Am I misunderstanding?
I thought you understood 
Time has turned against us, 
On this day

I will run 
I will fly 
I will see you in a matter of time 
I will run 
I will fly 
I will see you in a matter of time 
I will run 
I will fly 
I will see you in a matter of time 
I will run 
I will fly 
I will see you in a matter of time 

I'm stuck in denial 
I should stay 
Written in a letter 
Will this change? 

I know you're something special 
I know you're something good 
Am I misunderstanding?
I thought you understood 
I'm stuck in denial 
I should stay

I will run 
I will fly 
I will see you in a matter of time 
I will run 
I will fly 
I will see you in a matter of time 
I will run 
I will fly 
I will see you in a matter of time 
I will run 
I will fly 
I will see you in a matter of time 

I will see you in a matter of time 
I will see you in a matter of time 
I will see you in a matter of time 
I will see you in a matter of time 

I will run 
I will fly 
I will see you in a matter of time 
I will run 
I will fly 
I will see you in a matter of time 
I will run 
I will fly 
I will see you in a matter of time 
I will run 
I will fly 
I will see you in a matter of time
