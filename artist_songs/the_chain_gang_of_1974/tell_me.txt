So many nights were spent with regret
Our love became the victim of the public
And the poison they spit out

I witnessed the demise of living
The view of death invades my site
I'm forced to sit you down
And ask you all these things I need to hear

Tell me if your dreams can heal
Can you feel it?  Can you feel it?
Tell me if your thoughts are free
Can you feel it?  Can you feel it?

Sweet kisses to defeat the hurting
Still left with all the pain inside
There's nothing more to turn to in these times

I witnessed the demise of living
The view of death invades my site
I'm forced to sit you down
And ask you all these things I need to hear

Tell me if your dreams can heal
Can you feel it?  Can you feel it?
Tell me if your thoughts are free
Can you feel it?  Can you feel it?
The place you live came down on me
Can you feel it?  Can you feel it?
Tell me, am I what you need?
Can you feel it?  Can you feel it?

They're just the people looking over
We are the people getting older
They're just the people looking over
We are the people getting older

Tell me if your dreams can heal
Can you feel it?  Can you feel it?
Tell me if your thoughts are free
Can you feel it?  Can you feel it?
The place you live came down on me
Can you feel it?  Can you feel it?
Tell me, am I what you need?
Can you feel it?  Can you feel it?
