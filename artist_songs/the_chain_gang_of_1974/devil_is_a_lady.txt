Villains are running
Surpassing the falling
With disgrace
Saving face

Nightcrawlers digging
But yet still self-subsisting
In this place
Give or take

My conscience is keeping my body believing
I'm in tact
Is that a fact?

This lust is contagious
And I know it's dangerous
So I plead on my hands and knees

I get so high when the Devil comes to take me
I get so high when the Devil is a lady
I get so high when the Devil comes to take me
I get so high when the Devil is a lady

The fire is burning
No chance of returning
Out of sight
Keep it black and white

My love and affection
No sense of direction
High and low
Watch it come and go

My conscience is keeping my body believing
I'm in tact
Is that a fact?

This lust is contagious
And I know it's dangerous
So I plead on my hands and knees

I get so high when the Devil comes to take me
I get so high when the Devil is a lady
I get so high when the Devil comes to take me
I get so high when the Devil is a lady

Don't ever say it's over
When the night is young, we keep holding on

I get so high when the Devil comes to take me
I get so high when the Devil is a lady
I get so high when the Devil comes to take me
I get so high when the Devil is a lady
