Let's dance
Hey little baby, I was your little lovely
Are we just ordinary fools?

Kiss, kid, kiss little spiders
Let them build a lever
Are we just ordinary fools?

Hey, leave your records on [x4]

Cold feet, we make love at midnight
I need cherry coke and eyeline
Are we just ordinary fools?

I know I truly hate you
But deep down, fuck, I miss you
Are we just ordinary fools?

Hey, keep your records on [x4]
