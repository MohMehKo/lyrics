I couldn't see the places you go
That led you to think you've been safe
So you scream down at me
And think everything's alright

Your eyes tell the lie
Your hands even shake
The voice, it might break all the way home
Will you admit?  Or hide with that precious smile?

You got me on my knees with that heartbreakin' scream
You got me on my knees with that heartbreakin' scream
Slow down, just slow down
Just slow down and speak

That promise to me became the disease
I let you lay on a bed that's sacred
I'm begging you please
Go on and let me free

You gave me your word
My mother, she heard
You said to her face that you loved her third son
I'm begging you please, go on and let me free

You got me on my knees with that heartbreakin' scream
You got me on my knees with that heartbreakin' scream
Slow down, just slow down
Just slow down and speak

Heartbreak

You got me on my knees with that heartbreakin' scream
You got me on my knees with that heartbreakin' scream
Slow down, just slow down
Just slow down and speak
