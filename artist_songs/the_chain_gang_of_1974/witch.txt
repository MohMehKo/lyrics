Like kids fishing for my spine
Fake love, Palm trees and cheap wine
French kiss, pavement like you know
How one heals and how one grows
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my mind
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my life
The (laugh, life, light) of the midnight sun
Will bring (sharks, jokes) and all their fun
(Oh right, Alright, I'll write) outside breaks to find
Red lights, truth, and stolen time
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my mind
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my life
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my mind
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my life
Ooh, we know who did it
Ooh, (well) just admit it and go back where you came
Ooh, we know who did it
Ooh, (well) just admit it and go back where you came
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my mind
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my life
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my mind
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my life
Ooh, we know who did it
Ooh, (well) just admit it and go back where you came
Ooh, we know who did it
Ooh, (well) just admit it and go back where you came
