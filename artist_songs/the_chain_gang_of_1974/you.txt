I only have words to describe you, to describe you. 
I only have eyes to adore you, adore you. 
You are the one to take me in the depth.

Now you are gone. 
You shout out the lost to be the one.

Just like you, you. [x2]

Turn up the bright one to glow, to glow. 
Waving to your soul, hello, hello.

Now you are gone.
You shout out the lost to be the one.

Just like you, you. [x2]

Reasons I have to go.

You, you.

Just like you, you. [x2]
