You took away everything I had faith in
Left me drowned, shattered, wondering through a crowd
I took some pills, sang a song, then I fell down
To my surprise, I woke up and was screaming loud

On and on and on, it's up and go
I know I'm moving slow

You took away everything I had faith in
Left me drowned, shattered, wondering through a crowd
I took some pills, sang a song, then I fell down
To my surprise, I woke up and was screaming loud

On and on and on, it's up and go
I know I'm moving slow, but at least I've still got soul
I know I'm moving slow, but at least I've still got my soul

Can't stop, can't stop slipping away
I can't help feeling so low
Can't stop, can't stop slipping away
I can't help feeling so low
Can't stop, can't stop slipping away
I can't help feeling so low
Can't stop, can't stop slipping away
I can't help feeling so low

On and on and on, it's up and go
I know I'm moving slow, but at least I've still got soul
I know I'm moving slow, but at least I've still got my soul

Can't stop, can't stop slipping away
I can't help feeling so low
Can't stop, can't stop slipping away
I can't help feeling so low
Can't stop, can't stop slipping away
I can't help feeling so low
Can't stop, can't stop slipping away
I can't help feeling so low
Can't stop, can't stop slipping away
I can't help feeling so low
Can't stop, can't stop slipping away
I can't help feeling so low
Can't stop, can't stop slipping away
I can't help feeling so low
