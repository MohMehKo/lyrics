Just stop education
Just stop drinkin' through your soul
And open up your mind, wait
Stealing the latest fashion
This is the ugly side of you
The look is so clich√©

So I said
Stop, stop, stop, stop

Sex sells in Sunday's paper
Sold out and pinned up in his room
And ruining his life
These kids are valiant creatures
Victims of television love
Stop fuckin' with my mind

So I say
Stop, stop, stop, stop
One more time
Stop, stop, stop, stop

Loveless Mothers
Worthless Fathers
Hopeless Daughters
And Sons that have no eyes
