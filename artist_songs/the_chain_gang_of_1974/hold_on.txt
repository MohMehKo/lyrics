The fear inside is tearing up my outer skin
I try to hide because I feel it's giving it
Whether or not I believe her I know I'll try
Whether or not I believe her I know...
Your love is all I have to hold onto, to hold onto
Your love is all I have to hold onto, to hold onto
It's obvious that I'm crawling on my knee's
The cardinal sins that you take from me
Whether or not I believe her I know I'll try
Whether or not I believe her I know...
Your love is all I have to hold onto, to hold onto
Your love is all I have to hold onto, to hold onto
