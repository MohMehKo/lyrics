These days it seems I'm failing just to stand
I slip and sway to the movement of her glass
These night calls seem to resemble younger days of shame
And blurred lines only to prove my desperate game

She said "No!"
Why am I looking for love in the wrong place?
She said "Go home!"
Why am I looking for love in the wrong way?

The weight of aging has brought me to my knees
With dry lips, I fear that it reflects in me
She said "How will you come to admit you've drifted alone?
Will I ever see you again?"

She said "No!"
Why am I looking for love in the wrong place?
She said "Go home!"
Why am I looking for love in the wrong way?

How will you come to admit you've drifted alone?
Will I ever see you again?

She said "No!"
Why am I looking for love in the wrong place?
She said "Go home!"
Why am I looking for love in the wrong way?
Looking for love

Why am I looking for love in the wrong place?
Why am I looking for love in the wrong way?
