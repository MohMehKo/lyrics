In a nightmare
Of graveyard subject
Let it haunt you
Despite the rest

You're a vampire
On a conference call
Let the blood out
Let the blood in
Feel it all

Why do people like you think everything is alright?
Why do people like you think everything is alright?
Why do people like you think everything is alright?
Why do people like you think everything is alright?

Could be Christmas vacation on our way
Take it with you
Well it all depends

You're a vampire
On a conference call
Let the blood out
Let the blood in
Feel it all

Why do people like you think everything is alright?
Why do people like you think everything is alright?
Why do people like you think everything is alright?
Why do people like you think everything is alright?
Why do people like you think everything is alright?
(Will it break down, break down?)
Why do people like you think everything is alright?
(Will it break down, break down?
Why do people like you think everything is alright?
