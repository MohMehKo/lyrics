Simple feelings
Show us that there is meaning
Pure hearts shining like gold
Our ears ringing
With words that we've been singing
Don't cry this time we're alive

Quiet dreaming
Grab all your things, we're leaving
We won't ever belong, let's never go home now
We are with this
Together in the stillness
We won't ever belong, let's never go home now

Twilight's fading
Hurry, the moon is waiting
Forewer wallflowers, you and I
Across the night
Visions that we will hold tight
Float on, breathe in, my love

Let it be, let it be
We are never broken
When our eyes are open

Quiet dreaming
Grab all your things, we're leaving
We won't ever belong, let's never go home now
We are with this
Together in the stillness
We won't ever belong, let's never go home now

You don't have to stand alone tonight
You don't have to stand alone tonight

Quiet dreaming
Grab all your things, we're leaving
We won't ever belong, let's never go home now
We are with this
Together in the stillness
We won't ever belong, let's never go home now
