I can't imagine we can fix this
Driving through tucson with an empty list
Facing forward but moving backwards
Holding on now for a new day
This ain't a comeback, kisser
comeback, thriller
comeback, killer
This ain't a comeback, kisser

(Stop pushing)
And wait
(Stop pushing)
To decide

Tip my hat and say my goodbyes

(Search to find the key)
(Search to find the key)
This ain't a comeback, kisser
comeback, thriller
comeback, killer
This ain't a comeback, kisser
comeback, thriller
comeback
So I'll take my time
(Stop pushing)
And wait
(Stop pushing)
To decide
(Stop pushing)
If I'll open up my eyes
(Stop pushing)
And wait
(Stop pushing)
To decide
(Stop pushing)
If I'll open up my eyes
(Stop pushing)
And wait
(Stop pushing)
To decide
(Stop pushing)
If I'll open up my eyes
(Stop pushing)
And wait
(Stop pushing)
To decide
(Stop pushing)
If I'll open up my...
This ain't a comeback, kisser
comeback, thriller

This ain't a comeback, kisser

This ain't a comeback, kisser

This ain't a comeback, kisser
