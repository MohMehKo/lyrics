There must come a time
When foolish games are played by two
Just as long as the youthful
Can separate the pain from truth
Oh, the petals fall from desire and land on a liar
The cemetery gates will do

There you stood with the long stare
And whispered in my ear
I'm still haunting, haunting you

We both knew that our good days were over
There was nothing to do but sometimes I still feel
Like I'm still sitting here with strange desire, yeah
Cause I still wonder, I still wonder
But I still wonder, I still wonder

Some secrets are shameful
It's part of all those teenage years
But the sex and the regret
Can slowly close one off with tears
But I remember London in Winter
A cigarette and her
A moment I can't deny

Now all alone with a blank stare
I wish you were here
I'm still haunting, haunting you

We both knew that our good days were over
There was nothing to do but sometimes I still feel
I'm still sitting here with strange desire, yeah
Cause I still wonder, I still wonder
But I still wonder, I still wonder

We both knew that our good days were over
There was nothing to do but sometimes I still feel
Like I'm still sitting here with strange desire
Cause I still wonder, I still wonder
But I still wonder, I still wonder
Cause I still wonder, I still wonder
But I still wonder, I still wonder
