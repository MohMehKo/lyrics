In the fields where I saw you first
Rising like the sun
I saw it setting in your eyes
Take my hand, let's run

To the land our fathers built
Washed in their blood
For this life I'd give up 
To stand in your love

I've waited all my life
To know you in this way
I've waited all my life
I ask and I pray

Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Don't walk away

In the distance I heard you cry
For me to come home
Even though I'm a thousand miles
You're not alone

And to the land our fathers built
Bricks in their hands
For this life I'd give up
To stand as your man

I've waited all my life
To know you in this way
I've waited all my life
I ask and I pray

Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
