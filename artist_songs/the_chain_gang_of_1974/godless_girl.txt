In a quiet lucid dream
And the chill sets fire to me

Meet me by the lake
Come back to that day
And I'd feel nothing

I was in my state
You left for LA
To be a real woman

There are some things in life you can't take back
There are some things in life you can't take back

In a quiet lucid dream
And the chill sets fire to me

Please don't miss me
Forever I'll run away
I'll run away
Please don't miss me
Forever I'll run away

Memory is cruel
The fatalistic drug
That beats in your heart

It taps upon your skin
Again, again, again
And it leads you to run

Please don't miss me
Forever I'll run away
I'll run away
Please don't miss me
Forever I'll run away
