There's a picture frame inside those eyes
There he stands alone, a boy who cries
With an old man standing to my right
He's staring at my empty life
Go and try to change my mind
Thunder rolling down my spine
Push along through my wrongs
I'm breaking these walls
So I stand outside your window
With my hands up towards the sky
With the hopes of dancing on this street
So I wait outside for the taste of heaven
There's an answer in the desert sun
The vulture cries "the war is won!"
On a highway burning my last chance
I'm driving fast, I won't look back
Go and try to change my mind
Thunder rolling down my spine
Push along through my wrongs
I'm breaking these walls
So I stand outside your window
With my hands up towards the sky
With the hopes of dancing on this street
So I wait outside for the taste of heaven
Break the silence
Truth or violence
You chose to let me go
You gave me no reason
No chance to believe in
Only let downs show that I'm still alive
So I stand outside your window
With my hands up towards the sky
With the hopes of dancing on this street
So I wait outside for the taste of heaven
