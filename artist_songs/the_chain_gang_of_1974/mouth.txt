If you think you're forgiven
Then don't open your mouth
If you think you're perfection
Then don't open your mouth

Take my hand and feel this rage, ah
Feel this pulse I turn the page

Then lovely, hold your tongue

So fuck just like you're young
I was an honest man maybe for two years
Maybe more if you count the nights
I'm unheard in a bedtime story
I asked her "do you bite with your..."

Hold me down
Spook me out
Hold me down
Spook me out
