I am nothing
You are nothing
We were nothing
This was nothing

I am broken
You left me broken
Where's this darkness?
I'll speak to your maker and say

Please, please I beg you raise Hannah
Please, please I beg you raise Hannah
Better than Lola Suzanne

Your poor sister
Give her moonlight
Share your secrets, 
this is real life

Tell her stories
Of trust and Glory
Never let her be
Afraid to love again

Please, please I beg you raise Hannah
Please, please I beg you raise Hannah
Better than Lola Suzanne

Please, please I beg you raise Hannah
Please, please I beg you raise Hannah
Better than Lola Suzanne

We're so tired
We're so scared

Please, please I beg you raise Hannah
Please, please I beg you raise Hannah
Better than Lola Suzanne
