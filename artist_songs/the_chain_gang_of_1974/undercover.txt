Every little breath
Every little tear that you make
Hoping for the best
All we have are simple mistakes

With the graveyard dreams
And the broken screams of the golden
Through the wayward fire
And your minds desire left unspoken

Can you see me hurt?
Can you feel me burn?

Can you live as a lover?
Your mind's set with regret
Are these hearts undercover?
Eyes open, nothing's left

Desperate for the touch
Frozen as the world doesn't wait
Push me to the edge
Bliss is never permanent

Can you see me hurt?
Can you feel me burn?

Can you live as a lover?
Your mind's set with regret
Are these hearts undercover?
Eyes open, nothing's left

Can you live as a lover?
Your mind's set with regret
Are these hearts undercover?
Eyes open, nothing's left
