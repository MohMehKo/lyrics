I've been rambling around this hell for so long
With a woman of similar fame
If I don't regret all the things you said
Then I'm just a man who can't tamed

I've been alive when I should've been dead
I've been an outcast to the human race
I came out of the flesh when I born
I'm my Mother's child, that's how I'll stay

I'll never back the cause for the sake of solution
I'll never give up in the face of hate
I've been to heaven and hell, inside a prison cell
Held in captivity of a pretty face

This ain't a one way conversation
Have you ever been dead?
Have you ever been there?
This is a landslide indication
Have you ever been dead?
Have you ever been there?

This ain't a one way conversation
Have you ever been dead?
Have you ever been there?
This is a landslide indication
Have you ever been dead?

I've been trying to relax, but I can't back
From all the hypocrites on my case
I've given up on lust, I've given up on trust
I've given up on my own ways

I'm not gonna take any shit from you
The more you tease me the more I"ll speak
I must be shouting out loud cuz I can't get down
With the government and the whole damn thing

This ain't a one way conversation
Have you ever been dead?
Have you ever been there?
This is a landslide indication
Have you ever been dead?
Have you ever been there?

This ain't a one way conversation
Have you ever been dead?
Have you ever been there?
This is a landslide indication
Have you ever been dead?
Have you ever been there?

All I ever wanted was a space degree
All I ever wanted was a fantasy
All I ever wanted was a space degree
All I ever wanted was a fantasy

This ain't a one way conversation
