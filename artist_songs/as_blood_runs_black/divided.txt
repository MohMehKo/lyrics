You’re torn inside
You don’t know which voice to believe
Indecision will leave you with nothing
Why even try when you think you know all the answers?
When you just sit there rotting away
Do you know the difference between knowledge
And understanding?

Tribulations – denial in the face of the end
Endure the suffering and reinvent yourself
You’re mindless – it’s undermining your efforts
To improve on the life that you lead

Your perception is clouded by the minds of the infected
Your perception is clouded by the lies of the infected

Will their lies be believed?
Or will they crumble?

The unholy battle within one can leave you
Can leave you begging on your knees
For a chance to breath
You must disconnect from reality for
Just a moment of internal peace
Is the mind your ally or enemy?
In the end it all comes down to the eyes
In which you choose to see through

Let go of the thoughts that drag you straight to your fucking knees
And shed the skin of ignorance and assumptions

Confined within your mind lies the reasons why
You’re in this bind – with no way out!

There’s no way out!

Failure is hard to swallow when your eyes are closed
Know that it might be the last time that
You can make this right
You’ll find your way out
