Undo the chains of the past that are holding you back
Reclaim all that has been taken away from you
Deconstruct the walls in your mind that are making you blind

Break free from negativity that will shadow your life
Search for a reason to change
Life reveals itself when the decision is made
To move on and let go
It will help you unravel this road
You must – you must seek the truth

Seek the truth

Waiting for something to change
But what stands in the way is your hopeless
Outlook of reality
Deconstruct the walls in your mind that
Are making you blind

Break free from negativity that will shadow your life
Search for a reason to change
Life reveals itself when the decision is made
To move on and let go
It will help you unravel this road

See your way through

Self corruption manifests the darkest days
That man has ever seen
But the disappearing sun is controlled by you

Just believe in yourself
Don’t give up
Don’t give up
See your way through

Realize that the past is now left behind
That is where it belongs
Realize that the past is now left behind
Don’t forget where you’re from

Embrace the change – this is where you belong
