A little hard to get
But I got time for you
Yeah it's hard to move on
So why don't you come back?

Well I'm an intelligent guy
But am I wasting my time?
I try talking to you
And I'm staring to wonder, starting to wonder…

Can't save the rebel in you
Hands down you're beautiful
Get the feeling that you cannot move now
Hands down you're beautiful
Some kind of fascination
Hands down you're beautiful, you're beautiful.

You're in the land that time forgot
I wouldn't wait for you
Now it's happening again
So why don't you come back?
(Why don't you come back?)

Oh many times you've been
Sailing out of view
Yeah it's always the same
Now I'm starting to wonder, starting to wonder…

You can't stop the rebel in you
Hands down you're beautiful
You get the feeling that you cannot move now
Hands down you're beautiful
Some kind of fascination
Hands down you're beautiful, you're beautiful, oh!

You can't save the rebel in you
Hands down you're beautiful
Get the feeling that you cannot move now
Hands down you're beautiful

Can't stop the rebel in you
Hands down you're beautiful
Get the feeling that you cannot lose now
Hands down you're beautiful
Some kind of fascination
Hands down you're beautiful, you're beautiful, oh!
