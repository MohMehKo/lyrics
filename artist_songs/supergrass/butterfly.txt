Paters familia, facing the storm
Write your opinions on the toilet walls
Entitled to nothing but butterfly wings
Those little decisions could lead to anything

I could be crazy, if only you'd let me
If nobody tells you, you have to work it out
Wide-eyed at moonrise, the predator calls
It could be the last time they'll need you anymore

The devil has left me, oh, it's a smack in the face
'Cause when we're together, I get the sweetest taste
When I'm alone, I dream in my mind of traveling through space
But when we're together, I just lose my way

But, say, can you hear me, masters of war?
Fate is a journey, see what you're heading for
And knowledge ain't easy, insanity calls
Well, count yourself lucky that you don't know it all

The devil has left me, oh, it's a smack in the face
'Cause when we're together, I get the sweetest taste
When I'm alone, I dream in my mind of traveling through space
But when we're together, I just lose my way

Every morning, every day of my life
Feels like the turning of a page
Without a warning, there's a change in the night
Could be the dawning of an age

Millions of people with butterfly wings
Your tiny decisions could lead to anything
Oh

Paters familia, you're facing the storm
Write your opinions on the toilet walls
Entitled to nothing but butterfly wings
Those little decisions could lead to anything
