Finding your dreams in animal scenes down at the nightclub
She's got appeal, I like what I feel yeah, I'm going to lose it
Do what you want, and do it again
I wanted a change of blew it again

Well I didn't mean to, try and deceive you, now I'm feeling so ugly
Yes I hurt you, baby I love you, and I want you to come home now

I always try to walk the line, but I couldn't see it
So many times, you said you'd leave, but I didn't believe it
I know what I want, and can't explain
I blew it again, I blew it again

Well I didn't mean to, try and deceive you, now I'm feeling so ugly
Yes I hurt you, baby I love you, and I want you to come home now

aside from waiting, I could take you home, but hanging on I'll never know
Well I didn't mean to, try and deceive you, now I'm feeling so ugly
Yes I hurt you, baby I love you, and I want you to come home now
