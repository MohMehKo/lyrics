Lost sight
Lookin' for a way out
It's a good time, to get your head together
Blood shot
Don't wanna see you washed up, in a hotel I'll come up and check you out

This is the call, wake up boy, you're on your own
Get out your guns, you little outlaw on the run

Lucile, she wouldn't take a fall,
She said you used to be a heartbreaker (heartbreaker)
There's no fun sleeping with a shot gun
Put your head back, you'll live to meet your maker (maker)

This is the call boy, wake up boy, you're on your own
Get out your guns, you little outlaw on the run

When you're out in the cold, stoned, can't feel at all
So don't throw it all away cos you'll never get it back

Lost love, on the great adventure
So pick it up and put it back together
When you're knocked down, it's hard to understand
When opportunity is holding out a hand

This is the call boy, wake up boy, you're on your own
Get out your guns, you little outlaw on the run

This is the call boy, wake up boy, you're on your own
Get out your guns, you little outlaw on the run
