Never give up
Yeeaaah
Never give up

The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not the kind of girl
Who gives up just like that
Oh, no

Its not the things you do
That tease and hurt me bad
But its the way you do
The things you do to me
I'm not the kind of girl
Who gives up just like that
Oh, no

The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one
My number one
Number one

Every girl wants you to be her man
But Ill wait right here til its my turn
I'm not the kind of girl
Who gives up just like that
Oh, no

The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one, number one

Every time that I get the feeling,
You give me something to believe in,
Every time that I got you near me
I know the way that I want it to be,
But u know I'm gonna take my chance now,
I'm gonna make it happen some how,
And you know I can take the pressure
A moments pain for a lifetimes pleasure

Every girl wants you to be her man
But Ill wait right here til its my turn
I'm not the kind of girl
Who gives up just like that
Oh, no

The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one

Every time that I get the feeling,
You give me something to believe in,
Every time that I got you near me
I know the way that I want it to be,
But u know I'm gonna take my chance now,
I'm gonna make it happen some how,
And you know I can take the pressure
A moments pain for a lifetimes pleasure

The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one, number one...
