Oh you are so lazy
And I am so crazy
About the things you like to do
Well I get excited
At just at the sight of you

I don't get depression
At your full-on aggression
Cos you are the cat from Kalamazoo

Well you were outstanding
And I wasn't half bad too
Well at least that's what she said

Now hear me
Well you're under stated
Well almost sedated 
And you are the kind that can't be true
Well I get excited
At just at the sight of you

Help me, help me, one more time...
