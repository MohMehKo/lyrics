We're not supposed to
Make friends with you
Because you look so lonely
So we're going to make friends with you

We're not supposed to 
Talk to you
Because we know you're stranger
'Cause you're no stranger
Than me or you, than me or you

But everybody's going away
And everybody wants us to stay with you
And everybody's coming to say
And everybody wants us to stay with you

We're not supposed to
Make love to you
Because we know you're younger
(You're younger than me)
'Cause you're no younger than me or you

Than me or you
Than me or you
