Outside in the darkness, there's something happening here
Outside in the darkness, speeding out through the Universe
Hot fear and a heartbeat, standing face to face
Red light in the distance, it's getting cold and the air is running out

Outside in the darkness, could be nothing for days
Outside in the dullness, I can hear the devil walk about
Flying over the rock face, and over cities in flames
Red light in the distance, it's getting cold and the air is running out

It's on my TV screen (I'm not a static machine)
