I got a 20 ft halo
I'm gonna wear it out with my life
I'm gonna see if my legs can carry me home now
'Cause I'm really not safe

I'm lost in the halo
I'm lost and I'm going home
I'm lost in the halo

I got a 20 ft halo
I'm gonna wear it out with my life
I'm gonna see if my legs can carry me home now
'Cause I'm really not safe

I'm lost in the halo
I'm lost and I'm going home
I'm lost in the halo

I'm lost in the halo
I'm lost and I'm going home
I'm lost in the halo
I'm lost and I'm going home
