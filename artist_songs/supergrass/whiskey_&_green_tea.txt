Whiskey and green tea at the KTV
Whiskey and green tea nearly killed me like (at the KTV)

In my room, the ain't no sun or no moon
And I'm watching walking talking dogs do karate
Ohh, being chased by Chinese dragons

Through revolving doors, to the 13th floor
To be greeted by military rows of middle aged school girls
Ohh, being chased by Chinese dragons

Whiskey and green tea
At the KTV
(Sing along with me)
Whiskey and green tea nearly killed me (at the KTV)

I was found in a hutong haze
Climbing up forbidden city walls, like a Bond Square bandit

Ohh, being chased by William Burrows
Little rickshaw girl with a cock sure smile
The look of wild fire in her eyes took me out of this world
Ohh, being chased by Chinese dragons

Whiskey and green tea at the KTV
(Sing along with me)
Whiskey and green tea nearly killed me (at the KTV)
