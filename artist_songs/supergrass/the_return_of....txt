Tumble down the stairs
Cracked in the morning
Screaming cherubs in my head
Shootin' arrows all around
It ain't enough to make me frown

Turn on the television, open the papers
The headlines shout it out, we're on our knees, the end is really nigh
That ain't enough to make me cry, no

The return of inspiration
The return of inspiration

Little big man, workin' the city
He plays for money, plays for women, he must think he's so tall
Maybe no one's told him that he's small

Ten fingers piggy, counting the pennies,
Well that old meanie's only happy when he's draggin' you down,
That ain't enough to make me frown

The return of inspiration
The return of inspiration

Ain't got no problems, no, just complications
End of confusion, the return of inspiration

The return of inspiration
The return of serotonin
