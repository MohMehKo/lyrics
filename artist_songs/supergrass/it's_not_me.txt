Over their heads 
I find my place to crawl away
So many times 
I hear the things we used to say

Into the night 
The conversation fades away
Losing the drift 
Of all the things I had to say

It's not me, no, no, not me
But I don't know what is
I try and find my peace of mind
But I know what I miss
Now it's gone
Now it's gone
Now it's gone

As everyone listened 
My head turned away
I know what I'm missing
With nothing to say

It's not me, no, no, not me
But I don't know what is
I try and find my peace of mind
But I know what I miss

No, it's not me, no, no, not me
But I don't know what is
I try and find my peace of mind
But I know what I miss
