The ghost of a friend came down to me singing don't go back to misery
She spread out her wings and said listen to me
This ain't no place for you to be
Oh my darling you can set me free

So I packed up my sorrows and I followed her down to the West Way Road
heading outta town
The grass is greener off the beaten track
Come with me and we won't look back
Oh my darling I could only try

Yea the clowns here have taken the town, yeah the fools here are runnin'
me down
Well I don't need them around they got nothing on you, they got nothing on
you no

And the lady sings
Oooooooooohhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooooooohhhh

Now the ghost of a friend is leaving me
For another dark place of misery
But the fires burning and the winds they change
I know I'll see my friend again
Oh my darling you have made me see
There's always a circus in town
With the vultures, peacocks and hounds
Well I don't need that around, they got nothing on you, they got nothing
on you no

And the lady sings
Oooooooooohhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooooooohhhh

You see there's always a circus in town
With the vultures, peacocks and hounds
Well I don't need that around, they got nothing on you, they got nothing
on you no

And the lady sings
Oooooooooohhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooooooohhhh

And there she goes
