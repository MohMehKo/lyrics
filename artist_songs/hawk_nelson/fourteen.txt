Ooooh, ooooh, ooh 

The sun goes down, and then she slips away. 
It gets so lonely after dark. 
If only we could relive yesterday. 
Tomorrow always seems so far. 

Ooooh, ooooh, ooh 
Ooooh, ooooh, ooh 

The end is near; so much is left to say. 
The world is getting cold tonight. 
The traumatized people are so afraid. 
I smile 'cause everything's alright. 

Ooooh, ooooh, ooh 
Ooooh, ooooh, ooh 

Woah, woah, woah, woah 
Woah, woah, woah, ooh 

Ooooh, ooooh, ooh 
Ooooh, ooooh, ooh 

Ooooh, ooooh, ooh 
ooooh, ooooh, ooh
