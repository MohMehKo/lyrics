He's been prayin' for a brand new start
She's been tryin' everything to heal her heart
I know they're not the only ones
Prayin' for some hope to come
There's an empty spot in everyone
We're desperate for a perfect love
One that never walks away
That never fails and never fades

So if you've found the same love I've found
Then turn it up all the way
Live it like you don't have words to say
We gotta love like that
Love like that
We gotta love like that
Love like
The kind that's never far
The kind that changes who you are
We gotta love like that
Love like that
We gotta love like that
Love like that

Just like a little light to face the dark
It don't take much to reach so far
The more we give away
The more and more we gain

So if you've found the same love I've found
Then turn it up all the way
Live it like you don't have words to say
We gotta love like that
Love like that
We gotta love like that
Love like
The kind that's never far
The kind that changes who you are
We gotta love like that
Love like that
We gotta love like that
Love like that

So wherever we are tonight
Just look at what we've got inside
When it's real, it's something that you can't deny
It's true, it's impossible to hide
(It's impossible to hide)

So if you've found the same love I've found
(Oh!) Then turn it up all the way
Live it like you don't have words to say
We gotta love like that
Love like that
We gotta love like that
Love like
The kind that's never far
The kind that changes who you are
We gotta love like that
Love like that
We gotta love like that
Love like that
Oh, we gotta love like that
Love like that
We gotta love like that
Love like that
Oh
We gotta love like that
Love like that
