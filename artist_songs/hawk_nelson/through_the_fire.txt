I can feel the sun before I see its light
I can see my breath in the air on a cold night
But I can't see Your face or hear Your voice right now
All I hear is pain, it's the only sound

Why does it hurt?
Why does it hurt?

Won't You look down and let Your kingdom come?
When will Your justice come right every wrong?
When will I fight and not just watch myself give in?
Oh, does it make it old, forgiving all my sin?

Why does it hurt if You love me?
Why does it hurt if You're all I need?
Why does it hurt if Your light's alive inside of me?
Then why can't, why can't I just believe
You mean good for me?

You mean good for me
Yeah, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, God, I need to know
That Your love won't let me go
It won't stop, it won't grow tired
You just keep pullin' me through the fire
Just keep pullin' me through the fire

Right now, it hurts, But You love me
Right now, it hurts, But You're all I need
Right now, it hurts, But Your light's alive inside of me
So why can't, why can't I just believe
You mean good for me?
Why can't I just believe You  mean good for me?

Why can't I just believe You mean good for me?
You mean good for me?
Why can't I just believe You mean good for me?
