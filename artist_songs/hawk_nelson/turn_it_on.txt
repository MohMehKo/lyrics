Another Friday with the TV on
Listenin' to the same old song
How long will this carry on
Can I survive another weekend
Another night in my room pacin'
Another date with the playstation
Can't take it much longer
I just need something stronger

Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again
Make it strong, sing your song to the very end
Cause tonight we're alive and breathin'
Can you hear me, everyone near me
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again
Don't turn it off, cause this feeling doesn't have to end
I want to be, where you are, please take me
Just take me, shake me

Every calendar that goes by
Makes me take a look inside
I don't wanna just live my life
I want to mean something
Just another day to punch the clock
I'd do anything to make it stop
Can't take it much longer
I just need something stronger

Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again
Make it strong, sing your song to the very end
Cause tonight we're alive and breathin'
Can you hear me, everyone near me
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again
Don't turn it off, cause this feeling doesn't have to end
I want to be, where you are, please take me
Just take me, shake me
