Gone away far from home, the weekend's over
Let's pack up and start again
Twenty days on the road, just left Port Dover
With sixteen days to go

I just called my mom to tell her that I miss her
I just wrote my girl
Man I can't remember the last time I kissed her
Soon I'll be at home with all my friends
After thirty-six days on the road

Lights go down the noise has faded
We'll leave this town anticipated
Soon we'll be back on the road again
All is lost, but not forgotten
One by one the fights we've fought
And soon we'll be back on the road again
For thirty-six days

We turn around, face the crowd
We're starting over
This time north of L.A.
Once again here we are
It's a new beginning
I'd leave this life any day

I feel so alive, though part of me is gone
And this life I lead, is the life that I've dreamed of
Since I was the age of twelve
Now I'll sing with all this is within me
After thirty-six days on the road

Lights go down the noise has faded
We leave this town anticipated
Soon we'll be back on the road again
All is lost, but not forgotten
One by one the fights we've fought
And soon we'll be back on the road again
And soon we'll be back on the road again
Soon we'll be back on the road again
For thirty-six days
