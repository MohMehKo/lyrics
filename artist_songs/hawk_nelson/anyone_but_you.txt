Is it a dream? Is it real life? Is it a joke?
'Cause there's not a thing turning out right
Every step, I feel like I'm farther behind
End of my rope, out of a hope, that was days ago
That's what I thought, but somehow I faught
Every urge to let go
I knew I wasn't alone

When I see impossible come true
And when I see a miracle come through
And turn my dark to day
My doubt to faith
It's never left to fate
It couldn't be anyone but You
It couldn't be anyone but You
It couldn't be anyone but You
It couldn't be anyone but You

I'm starting to see, noticing things
That carry Your fingerprints
All credit is due, pointing to You
I've seen the evidence to prove
There's no one but You

When I see impossible come true
And when I see a miracle come through
And turn my dark to day
My doubt to faith
It's never left to fate
It couldn't be anyone but You
It couldn't be anyone but You
It couldn't be anyone but You
It couldn't be anyone but You

All through my ups and downs
You were just waiting on my call
You turned this life around
And You are never far

When I see impossible come true
And when I see a miracle come through
And turn my dark to day
My doubt to faith
It's never left to fate

When I see impossible come true
And when I see a miracle come through
And turn my dark to day
My doubt to faith
It's never left to fate
It couldn't be anyone but You
It couldn't be anyone but You
It couldn't be anyone but You
It couldn't be anyone but You

Anyone but You
(It couldn't be) Anyone but You
(It couldn't be) Anyone but You
(It couldn't be) Anyone but You
