Lying in my ocean
Thinking of his subtle notions
Waiting to hear from the winds of your heart

Searching for a love with no end
And I'm smiling cause on you I depend
And I'm striving for your never failing love

I'm crying out this is my prayer
I gave my word and this I swear
I'll follow you cause you've promised me
So return to me

Praying for a change im my spirit
Reaching out and I know you can hear it
Striving for your never failing love
