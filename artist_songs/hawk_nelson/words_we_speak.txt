She woke up with a tear-stained pillow
She just broke up with a nice young fellow
All those tears you cry, now it's time to say goodbye
You're on your own, you're all alone

We're better than the words you speak
So much more than incomplete
Figure out what life means out on our own
Words you say can't bring us down
We've all failed and hit the ground
Now it's time for us just to take control

Can't comply we're perfect in your eyes
We fall down but it's just a part of life

All those tears you cry, now it's time to say goodbye you're on your
own you're all alone

We're better than the words you speak
So much more than incomplete
Figure out what life means out on our own
Words you say can bring us down
We've all failed, hit the ground
Now it's time for us just to take control

Now I'm here to let you know
That we can't make it on our own
What's mine is yours I'm letting go
You know I'd never doubt you
You know I'm lost without you
I'm giving you control

We're better than the words you speak
So much more than incomplete
Figure out what life means out on our own
Words you say can't bring us down
We've all failed, hit the ground
Now it's time for us just to take control
