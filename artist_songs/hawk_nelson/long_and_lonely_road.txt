I took a walk down a country road
I know this might sound dumb maybe
But I was all alone

If you think that I'm going somewhere
Take me hand I'll lead you there
Don't want to have to call you up from a pay phone

It's a long and lonely road
It's a long and lonely road
If you don't like it
Then you don't take it
It's a long and lonely road

I took a walk down a country road
I know this might sound dumb maybe
But I was all alone

If you think that I'm going somewhere
Take me had I'll lead you there
Don't want to have t call you up from a pay phone

I know it is so hard for you and I to be apart
I'm slowly fading, you're my lady
That keeps me moving on

It's a long and lonely road
It's a long and lonely road
If you don't like it
Then please don't take it
It's a long and lonely road

Honest promise you will be missed
