Just when I thought I was gone, 
Too far, too far gone and no one cared 
Just when I thought I was lost, 
So lost I'd never be found 
I turn around and you're right there, 
You're right there 

You open up your arms and give me a new start 
I need you, I need you more than my next breath 
I know that I am loved, cuz you bought me with your blood 
I need you, I need you more than my next breath yeah 

Ashamed of who I've become, 
Afraid that if I look up I'd see your tears 
But you have called me by name 
And you have loved me the same 
I'm forever changed and you are here, 
You are here 

You open up your arms and give me a new start 
I need you, I need you more than my next breath 
I know that I am loved, cuz you bought me with your blood 
I need you, I need you more than my next breath yeah 

I surrender my soul, 
To your love, to your hope 
Where you go I will go with you 

You open up your arms and give me a new start 
I need you, I need you more than my next breath 
I know that I am loved, cuz you bought me with your blood 
I need you, I need you more than my next breath yeah
