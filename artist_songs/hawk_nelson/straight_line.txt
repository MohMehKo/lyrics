Woke up from a dream
With a song in my head
I still hear the beat
Can't remember what it said
I think it went
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I've had time to sleep
Now it's time to move on
I won't wait until the moment is gone
I'll get up and
Go, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I'll step into the light
It's my time to shine
I'm walking in a straight line
I won't compromise
The end in my sights
I'm walking in a straight line
I'm walking in a straight line
I'm walking in a straight line

So long apathy
And goodbye regret
No more wandering
I know where I'm headed
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I know, oh, oh

I'll step into the light
It's my time to shine
I'm walking in a straight line
I won't compromise
The end in my sights
I'm walking in a straight line
I'm walking in a straight line
I'm walking in a straight line

Won't bend don't try
Walk in a straight line
No left no right
Walk in a straight line
Won't bend don't try
Walk in a straight line
No left no right
Walk in a straight line

I'll step into the light
It's my time to shine
I'm walking in a straight line
I won't compromise
The end in my sights
I'm walking in a straight line
I'm walking in a straight line
I'm walking in a straight line
