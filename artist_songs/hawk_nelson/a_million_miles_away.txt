I've got this feeling
And I know it's not just me
Everyone's got things they wanna leave
Escape the things they can't escape
The stuff we try to hide away
But grace says, "Put 'em in their place!"

A million miles away-ay-ay-ayy
And further every day-ay-ay-ayy
Since I met You
Everything that I used to carry
Disappeared in the dust behind me
You took it all, it's gonna stay
A million miles away-ay-ay-ayy
A million miles away

That day, You changed me
And You made my past, my past
All I know is I'm not going back, oh
What's done is done
What's gone is gone
You came to right my every wrong
And leave 'em right where they belong

A million miles away-ay-ay-ayy
And further every day-ay-ay-ayy
Since I met You
Everything that I used to carry
Disappeared in the dust behind me
You took it all, it's gonna stay
A million miles away

It's getting smaller in my rear-view
The closer I get to You
And it's all gonna stay
A million miles away-ay-ay-ayy
A million miles away-ay-ay-ayy

A million miles away-ay-ay-ayy
And further every day-ay-ay-ayy
Since I met You
Everything that I used to carry
Disappeared in the dust behind me
You took it all, it's gonna stay
A million miles away

Like the east is from the west
Like the height is from the depth
You took it all away
It's gonna stay
A million miles away

Like the east is from the west
Like the height is from the depth
You took it all away
It's gonna stay
