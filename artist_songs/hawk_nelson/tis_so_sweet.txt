'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus
Just to take Him at His Word
Just to rest upon His promise
And to know "thus saith the Lord"
You're the shelter in the storm
You're the dearest friend I know
Oh, Light of the world, carry me home
Oh, for grace to trust Him more
Jesus, Jesus how I trust Him
How I proved Him o'er and o'er
Jesus, Jesus precious Jesus
Oh, for grace to trust Him more
Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus
Just from sin and self to cease
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life and rest and joy and peace
Give me strength to trust You more
