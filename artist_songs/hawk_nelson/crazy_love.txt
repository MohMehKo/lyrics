We're the ones who believe in the things unseen 
This home, this party is an in between 
We're the ones who fight down on our knees 
Who dare to love our enemies 
Love enemies 

They say it sounds insane 
We say that we've been changed 
By the power of 
Crazy Love 
This world, it looks at us 
Like we're ridiculous 
Baby, it's all because 
Of Crazy Love 

We're the ones gonna put it all in reverse 
Gonna die to ourselves, Gonna live to serve 
Cause when you get what you get when you walk by faith 
Is it really so dumb to give it all away? 
Give it all away 

They say it sounds insane 
We say that we've been changed 
By the power of 
Crazy Love 
This world, it looks at us 
Like we're ridiculous 
Baby, it's all because 
Of Crazy Love 
Crazy Love 

We know it sounds absurd 
We don't get what we deserve 
It's by grace we are saved 

They say it sounds insane 
We say that we've been changed 
By the power of 
Crazy Love 
This world, it looks at us 
Like we're ridiculous 
Baby, it's all because 
Of Crazy Love 
Crazy Love 

We're the ones who believe in the things unseen 
This home, this party is an in between 
We're the ones who fight down on our knees 
Who dare to love our enemies 

We're the ones gonna put it all in reverse 
Gonna die to ourselves, Gonna live to serve 
Give it all away 

Crazy Love
