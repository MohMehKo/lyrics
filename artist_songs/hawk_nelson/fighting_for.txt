We decided to take a chance
Took a breath and promised it
Headed where we'd never been before
Don't stop to take our time
Just put your hand in mine
No place too far for us to go

It's easy as open, open up the door
Together, we open, open up the door

Oh, we'll cherish the time that we're sharin'
'Cause we're not kids anymore
And oh, we won't just forget what we promised
It's you I'll be fighting for

Wrongs turns and winding roads
More than we bargained for
We chased the light under the stars
Hard lessons learned in time,
But I'm yours and you are mine
Out here, we're finding who we are

Oh, we'll cherish the time that we're sharin'
'Cause we're not kids anymore, oh
And oh, We won't just forget what we promised
It's you I'll be fighting for

We said we'd remember that we'd never be too far
When you reach for me, I'll find you where you are
There is nothing you have to convince me of
There is no way you can hide from my love
From my love
From my love

And oh, we''ll cherish the time that we're sharin'
'Cause we're not kids anymore,
And oh, we won't just forget what we promised
It's you I'll be fighting for
It's you I'll be fighting for
