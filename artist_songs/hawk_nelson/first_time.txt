Stepping over two steps closer
I sit around wasting time, feel like the poster for a 
Self-help line
Well me know the truth when we're older

For the first time in my whole life
I'm not afraid of feeling alive
For the last time I'm falling behind
And nothing out there will change me mind

Let's start over crimson clover
While those golden nights get colder

If I could I'd press rewind
Turn on record and leave the past behind
Will we know the truth when we're older

For the first time in my whole life
I'm not afraid of feeling alive
For the last time I'm falling behind
And nothing out there will change me

When you find me will you remind me
We're one step closer, two steps closer

For the first time in my whole life
I'm not afraid of feeling alive
For the last time I'm falling behind
And nothing out there will change me

For the first time in my whole life 
I'm not afraid of feeling alive
For the last time I'm falling behind
And nothing out there will change me

For the first time in my whole life
I'm not afraid of feeling alive
This is the last time I'm falling behind
And nothing out there will change my mind
