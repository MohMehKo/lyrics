Mama always said to me the very best medicine is gratitude
It's not what you don't have, but what you do
I must admit that I forget that life's a gift
Hey mama, gonna change my attitude
1, 2, 3, 4
Count my blessings
1, 2, 3, 4
Count my blessings

If you got a lot or a lotta nothing
Go ahead and thank God for something
You're gonna see the good if you're good at looking
So go ahead and thank God for something

We have a lot or have a little it's really nothing new
Happiness should never be a slave to revenue
We got a breakdown need a way out living unbound
When we start singing out a new tune
1, 2, 3, 4
Count my blessings
1, 2, 3, 4
Count my blessings

If you got a lot or a lotta nothing
Go ahead and thank God for something
You're gonna see the good if you're good at looking
So go ahead and thank God for something

In the wonder, in the heartache
In the good times and the mistakes
No matter what I am going through
I can always say thank you
When the blessings are in disguise
Let gratitude open my eyes
Cause I've just been given too much
To do anything but
1, 2, 3, 4
Count my blessings
1, 2, 3, 4
Count my blessings

If you got a lot or a lotta nothing
Go ahead and thank God for something
You're gonna see the good if you're good at looking
So go ahead and thank God for something

If you got a lot or a lotta nothing
Go ahead and thank God for something
You're gonna see the good if you're good at looking
So go ahead and thank God for something
