Come back don't leave keep stalling
Come back to me I'm falling
In love

But the last thing you said to me
Made it seem like those just won't last
Time and time again
Breaking all our plans from the past

You'll find out
Hear me now
There's someone better out there

You made me laugh
I made you cry
It's time we said our last goodbye
