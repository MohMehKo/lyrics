Billy made a promise but didn't end though
Carrie had a dream but she threw it out the window
Kevin met a nice girl who broke his heart and
His friends never told him but they knew it from the start and...

These are the things we go through
Let's take control and be ourselves
Let's not waste time wondering about
How we're gonna make it out

Wake up everyone around you
Let's rock until the clock strikes two
Stand up for what you believe and shout to
Here's another song from the youth that surround you

Kyle's parents split up, he thinks it's his fault
Little does he know that the time they're in was difficult
Andrea she left home, said she had enough
All she really wanted was somebody else there to love

She's all alone again, it's the same old argument
And she needs a helping hand to help her find the truth

These are the things we go through
Let's take control and be ourselves
Let's not waste time wondering about
How we're gonna make it out

Wake up everyone around you
Lets rock until the clock strikes two
Stand up for what you believe and shout to
Here's another song from the youth that surround you

Save me I'm all alone as I'm coming to the surface
Tell me I've got to know what is my meaning and my purpose
Show me I'm far from home lost with no sense of direction
Take me to Your throne
