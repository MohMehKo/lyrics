Some girls tell you what you wanna hear
Those girls always make it very clear
But I know things are not what they appear
Nothing from nothing gets you nothing at all
We talk hours on the telephone
But you shut down when we're alone
You stop us from being close
Nothing from nothing gets you nothing at all

There's no rhyme and there's no reason

She don't want anything other than
She don't need anyone other than
She don't see anyone but herself, herself
I don't want anyone other than
I don't need anyone other than
I will solve your mystery and make it ancient history

Some guys try to hide the way they feel
And sometimes it takes someone to break the seal
You can't negotiate a one-way deal
Nothing from nothing gets you nothing at all
I'll wait I've got the patience of a saint
I just don't want you to hesitate
Cause you don't ever wanna mess with fate
Nothing from nothing gets you nothing at all

There's no rhyme and there's no reason

She don't want anything other than
She don't need anyone other than
She don't see anyone but herself, herself
I don't want anyone other than
I don't need anyone other than
I will solve your mystery and make it ancient history

Don't mislead me, don't mistreat me
I don't understand why you're wearing me down
Please believe me, why defeat me
I don't understand why you're breaking me down

She don't want anyone other than
She don't need anything other than
She don't see anyone but herself, herself
I don't want anyone other than
I don't need anyone other than
I will solve your mystery and make it ancient history

History, history...
