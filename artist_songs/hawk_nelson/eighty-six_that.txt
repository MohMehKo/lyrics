Take me as I am
Tell me where you stand
What you've done for me is more than I can tell
From a little seed
Tell me what you see
Make me needed

I'm so excited
I can't hide it
And I'm so happy
When you are with me

You took me as I was
Put me on higher ground
All you've done for me is more than I deserve
The reason why I live
The more and more you give
I'm so thankful

We're here to rock
We dare not stop
The night is young
We've just begun
