Will someone please radio for help?
Cuz I think I'm allergic to myself 
And they think they can throw us all away 
We gotta stop it before it's all too late 

There's got to be a better way 
They dissect everything we say 
To try to make us feel this way 

And you can take the one thing I have left 
I'd give it all away for so much less 
Can even take the heart inside my chest 
Woah-woah. 
And you can take the one thing I have left 
Beat me to the ground and take my breath 
But you can't take who I am 
woah-woah. 

And I swear we were born to let you down 
We scream but never make a sound 
We point but don't know which direction 
We are America right now 

There's got to be a better way 
They dissect everything we say 
To try to make us feel this way 

And you can take the one thing I have left 
I'd give it all away for so much less 
Can even take the heart inside my chest 
Woah-woah. 
And you can take the one thing I have left 
Beat me to the ground and take my breath 
But you can't take who I am 
woah-woah. 

How can I be the same?
How can I say the blame?
How come I am so tired of all these charades? 
How can I be the one?
How can I hold the gun? 
How can I see if everyone else is to blame?

hey! hey! 
Don't want to be the 
hey! hey! 
Don't want to see the 
hey! hey! 

Cuz we point the finger 
Think everyone else is to blame 

Everyone else is to blame
