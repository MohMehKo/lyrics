I've tried my best to hear out the masses,
I've heard it all, from A to Z.
I've read it all, been to all of the classes,
And still I'm tryin' but I just can't see through the smoke.

And I don't want it, this confusion,
I don't want a false solution.
Give me something to hold on to,
I want what you have 'cause you have what I need.

I know it's hard to be yourself when
you're not sure just who that is.
All I wanted was satisfaction,
but all I got was empty fists.
Can you hear me?

And I don't want it, this confusion,
I don't want a false solution.
Give me something to hold on to,
I want what you have 'cause you have what I need.

All I wanted was honesty,
and that was something only you give.
It took forever just to realize that I had to give myself away, 
so I could see your face and learn how to live.
I can't erase your mark,
you may take every thing else away.

And I don't want it, this confusion,
I don't want a false solution.
Give me something to hold on to,
I want what you have 'cause you have what I need.

I want what you have 'cause you have what I need.
