With every star You've hung up in the sky
You were leaving Your fingerprints
And when You brought my heart to life
You were leaving Your fingerprints
I know I'm here for a reason
And there's a purpose in every season
Cause You got me, got me believing
Oh You got me, got me believing

I was made to live
I was made to live
I was made to live
For You
I was born for this
Not to just exist
I was made to live
For You

So if I could learn to love the way You do
I'll be leaving Your fingerprints
And when I stand for what is true
I'll be leaving Your fingerprints
And my heart it might take a beating
Sometimes this blood is for bleeding
And I know I'm here for a reason
Oh You got me, got me believing

I was made to live
I was made to live
I was made to live
For You
I was born for this
Not to just exist
I was made to live
For You

So I'll give it all I have
Till nothing's left
I'm not holding back
A single breath

Cause I was made to live
I was made to live
I was made to live
For You
I was born for this
Not to just exist
I was made to live
For You
