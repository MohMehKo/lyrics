When I hurt You, I never meant to hurt You
I'm just trying to work through things in my life
Emotions can be mean and I didn't really mean it
I never stopped believing in the truth

I'm not big on waiting
I could use some patience
This time I'm not afraid of losing

Wrap Your arms around me I know
Trying hard not to let go
Every time I stand up, I fall without You
When You wrap Your arms around me I know
With me wherever I go
Nothing else matters at all when You're here

You're always near me, even when it's ugly
Even when I'm screaming up to You
I'm thankful for Your mercy
You always seem to hear me
It's not always easy to push through

I'm not big on waiting
I could use some patience
This time I'm not afraid of losing
Cause I'm not one to frown when
The sun is going down and
I'm happy to just wait on You

Wrap Your arms around me I know
Trying hard not to let go
Every time I stand up, I fall without You
When You wrap Your arms around me I know
With me wherever I go
And nothing matters at all when You're here

I promise I'll never doubt You
You know I'm lost without You
Please hold me in Your arms tonight

Wrap Your arms around me I know
Trying hard not to let go
Every time I stand up, I fall without You
When You wrap Your arms around me I know
With me wherever I go
And nothing matters at all when You're here
