Every time I see you I can see right through you
Knowing I could never change your mind
I look into your eyes for the last time
I have realized for the first time

While everyone is around I'll take a moment
To let you know that I am down

Have all my questions been ignored?
This time I'm walking out the door

I don't know if I'll ever know why
Or hear the sound when angel's cry
What you said to me late last night 
I'll remember for the rest of my life
Every night when I close my eyes
I see the ways that you've touched my life
And I want you to know that I'll
Always be right here

Time stands still, so do I, leave me here
But for now I will go and I won't say nothing
Every time I hear that sound it reminds me that 
You're always hanging around

Have all my questions been ignored?
This time I'm walking out the door

I don't know if I'll ever know why
Or hear the sound when angel's cry
What you said to me late last night 
I'll remember for the rest of my life
Every night when I close my eyes
I see the ways that you've touched my life
And I want you to know that I'll
Always be right here

These are the days these are the moments that pass us by
We ask the questions but we never really find out why

Pull my card right from the bottom
Reminds me of the things we've forgotten
That road trip we look back in autumn
The time we left and went back and got 'em

These are the days these are the moments that pass us by

I don't know if I'll ever know why
Or hear the sound when angel's cry
What you said to me late last night 
I'll remember for the rest of my life
Every night when I close my eyes
I see the ways that you've touched my life
And I want you to know that I'll
Always be right here
