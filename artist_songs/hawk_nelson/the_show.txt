E-e-everywhere I go, 
It's all been taken 
Pick me up a book about new sensations 
T-t-take me to a place 
With no frustration 
Better back it up before I lose my patience

Let's take 'em to the show whoaoh 
C'mon, turn on your radio

Let's take 'em to the show whoaoh 
C'mon, turn up your radio 

C-c-call me on the phone 
Or two way pager 
Won't be comin' home so see ya later 
You can keep your cars
And your jet-black hummer
Won't see me again until next summer
