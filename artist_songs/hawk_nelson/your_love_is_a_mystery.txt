God I messed it up again, I seem to do this all the time
Can you forgive me one again, or have I finally crossed the line?
They say Your grace is always with me and You're near me all the time
If that's the case I pray sincerely that Your love is truly blind

The people on the outside watching me follow the crowd, find a way out
You know something on the inside's pushing me without a doubt
So I'm letting it go

I'm never always right and it's plain to see
You love me Jesus, It's a mystery
You know my faults, You know my wrongs
And You still love me

God I know that you exist, I've been told a thousand times
But my friends they all insist that the truth is just a lie
You see the lives that they all live seems like a party all the time
The temptations I resist, because it's You I glorify

The people on the outside watching me follow the crowd, find a way out
You know something on the inside's pushing me without a doubt
So I'm letting it go

I'm never always right and it's plain to see
You love me Jesus, It's a mystery
You know my faults, You know my wrongs
And You still love me

Let everything that I do or say
reflect You in every way
Your way

I'm never always right and it's plain to see
You love me Jesus, It's a mystery
You know my faults, You know my wrongs
And You still love me

I'm never always right and it's plain to see
You love me Jesus, It's a mystery
You know my faults, You know my wrongs
And You still love me

You love me Jesus, It's a mystery
(You love me)
You love me Jesus, It's a mystery
