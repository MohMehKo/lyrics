Tally-tally ho, tally-tally ho-ho 
My eye's on the mark and we're taking it home 
Tally-tally ho, tally-tally ho-ho 
Fire in the air and we're taking it home 

Pouring out the gasoline, ignite the fumes (wo-oh) 
Sweet taste of victory in view 

Tally-tally ho, tally-tally ho-ho 
My eye's on the mark and we're taking it home 
Tally-tally ho, tally-tally ho-ho 
Fire in the air and we're taking it home 

Won't get the best of me, you never do (wo-oh) 
This clash is long-time overdue 

Tally-tally ho, tally-tally ho-ho 
My eye's on the mark and we're taking it home 
Tally-tally ho, tally-tally ho-ho 
Fire in the air and we're taking it home
