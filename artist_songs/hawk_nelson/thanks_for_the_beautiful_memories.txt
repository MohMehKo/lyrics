Started out, we were 17 
Bought a van and we hit the scene 
Didn't know exactly what to do 

Finished school, got our band on track 
Signed our first record contract 
Never thought our dreams would all come true 

Everything we ever wanted 

We just wanna thank you for all that we've been through together 
Dreams become reality 
And we just wanna thank you one more time 

Left home, Ontario, heard our song on the radio 
Never knew that life could be this way 
Loved a girl and she loved me 
Bought a house in Tennessee 
I thank god for blessing me each day 

Everything we ever wanted 

We just wanna thank you for all that we've been through together 
Dreams become reality 
And we just wanna thank you one more time 

We'll never thank you enough 

We just wanna thank you for all that we've been through together 
Dreams become reality 
And we just wanna thank you one more time
