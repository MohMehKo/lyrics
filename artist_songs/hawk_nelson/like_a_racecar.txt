Broken words said to me
These broken mirrors make it hard to see
Does anyone feel the same?
I need some help, I need some change
Broken dreams and broken hearts
You broke my trust right from the start
How am I supposed to feel
When nothing's ever real?

If you want me try to take me
On the inside, just like a racecar

Carry on, but daddy's gone
Tell me what did I do wrong
I need your help cause I don't know
Take it slow, Look out below

And I'm traveling past the ever-growing graffiti on the over-pass
I wave to everybody while I fly on past
Cause this racecar was built to last

If you want me try to take me
On the inside, just like a racecar
Cut the corners if you'd like to
Take me away
I want to but I can't let go

It's six in the morning here
I lay awake I'm waiting for my mind to clear up
So I can rewind and just count myself to sleep
And everyday I want to climb to a new height
My life is like the making of a long ride
I started the ignition such a ling time ago

If you want me try to take me
On the inside, just like a racecar
Cut the corners if you'd like to
Take me away
I want to but I can't let go

I'll let you drive, I'll let you drive
I'll let you drive, I'll let you take me away
