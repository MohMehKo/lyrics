Joanna sits on her porch, what am I to do 
I once was her boy but now we're done I'm feeling blue 
I'm getting out this town, Starbucks drive-thru 
I reach for my cash and only find pictures of you 

Should I call or should I run? 
Turn around or just move on? 
Either choice I make I'm scared will still be wrong 

Take, take, take it till I just can't take it from you (Joanna) 
Fake, fake, fake it till I just can't make it with you (Joanna) 
Say goodbye a hundred times, but never see it through 
The hardest way to say Joanna, I need you 

Took a trip out west, went to Saskatoon 
To clear all the thoughts in my head, the only thoughts I knew 
Turned on the radio, a stupid thing to do 
Cuz all the songs I hear remind me of you 

They say that love is more than a feeling 
But you gotta hear me out
