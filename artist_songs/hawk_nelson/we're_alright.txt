Went to t.o. for the weekend 
Backstage passes for the show 
Muddy shoes, fresh tattoos and a brand new feel- ing 
That tonight will be alright we're letting go 

How does it feel just to know that we're out of our minds 
And we don't need a reason 
How does it feel to know you're alright 
How does it feel just to know that we are alive 
There ain't no better reason 
We can make it to- night everything is alright 

Distant dreams, a trillion questions 
And we exaggerate them all 
We think the teens in magazines they have all the answers 
As we build this machine to watch it fall 

How does it feel just to know that we're out of our minds 
And we don't need a reason 
How does it feel to know you're alright 
How does it feel just to know that we are alive 
There ain't no better reason 
We can make it to- night everything is alright 

How does it feel to know you're alright 
We can make it tonight, we can make it tonight
