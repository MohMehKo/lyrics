I've been writing down these feelings in my mind
The sick, the hurt, the jaded, and the blind
I just know there's something missing on the inside

The answers that I found are not enough
'Cause I gotta fill up all the holes where joy leaks out
I wanna open up with new eyes
I wanna open up with new eyes

I'm tellin' you, what I'm looking for
Is something more than a feeling
What I'm looking for
Is something bigger than me
What I'm looking for
Is something I can believe in
More than a feeling
More than a feeling, oh
More than a feeling, oh

I keep running, 'cause I've always been afraid
That if I stop, I'll know the demons that I face
I gotta build the courage just to say
I need more than you can offer me

I'm tellin' you, what I'm looking for
Is something more than a feeling
What I'm looking for
Is something bigger than me
What I'm looking for
Is something I can believe in
More than a feeling
More than a feeling, oh
More than a feeling, oh

I need more than just a temporary high
I want more than just a momentary life
If I breathe my final breath tonight
I wanna know you'll welcome me inside

What I'm looking for
Is something more than a feeling
Something bigger than me
What I'm looking for
Is something I can believe in
More than a feeling
More than a feeling

What I'm looking for, yeah, yeah
What I'm looking for, yeah, yeah
What I'm looking for, oh
More than a feeling
