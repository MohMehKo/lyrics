I'm gonna say whatever's on my mind
As you walk away with half of what is mine
Nothing's gonna change
So I'm giving up on you
And you're not gonna change my mind
You complicate until the dotted line
So I wrote this song to try to pass the time
You can't take my dignity
You can't take my pride
I've got my integrity
But you've just crossed the line
No one's even heard of me
Well I'm not gonna cry
I don't want your apology, and I don't want the job
