Your Life dreams are shattered,
Now you're gone away.
We've cried here for hours,
And the hours turn to days.
We know you regret this,
Leaving us here,
With portraits and memories
That we've held so dear.

When I hear your name, it's not the same.
No matter what they say, I'm not okay.
And we started at zero, and went different ways.
Now we're all out here wasting away.

And if we started at zero, then how did things change?
It seems like just yesterday we were the same.

It's been three months since he left us.
So far nothing's been the same.
And my question without answer is:
Am I the one to blame?

He was such a good description of a favored future man.
He spoke well of other people, and they said the same for him.

When I hear your name, it's not the same.
No matter what they say, I'm not okay.
And we started at zero, and went different ways.
Now we're all out here wasting away.
And if we started at zero, then how did things change?
It seems like just yesterday we were the same, we were the same
They say they're sorry, well what are they sorry for?
How can they possible know what I'm going through?

I feel like no one's ever had to deal with the pain that I'm dealing with right now.

[spoken:]
Does anyone have answers?
Just Six months ago everything was fine. or so it seemed.
What turn of event caused him to go downhill?
His parents are devastated.
His girlfriend's depressed.
What was he thinking!?

And we started at zero
And went different ways
Now we're all out here wasting away
Wasting away
Wasting away

And we started at zero
And went different ways
Now we're all out here wasting away
And if we started at zero
Then how did things change?
It seems like just yesterday we were the same
We were the same
We were the same
