I had another dream today
I gotta let it out
The media has lost it's brain- what's this all about?
The action, the drama has got me on my seat's edge all the time
TSN's been on my screen since I read the news last night
If it's true, then can someone let me know?
I need proof, that this rumor's not a joke
Is it a myth, a legend, an old wives tale?
I guess we'll see it through
If The Flames when Lord Stanley, then we all win it too
