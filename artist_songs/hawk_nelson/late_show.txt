You get me so simply
But my heart won't let me

I won't forget that night I saw her at the movies
She has this way about her, she smiles whenever she walks
I'm trying to find the nerve to finally introduce me
She had this glow about her you'd catch whenever she talks

Let's go, knocking on my window
We can watch the late show
And movies made for cable
And then we'll talk, listening to punk rock
We'll hang out and wait up
Until the sun comes up
