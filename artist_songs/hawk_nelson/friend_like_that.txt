I like it simple and
I'm not a Superman
I never said that I was more than that
I'm not a wanna be
I'm who I want to be
And I intend to be
How you created me

[Pre-chorus:]
I... I need somebody on the inside
I... I want somebody who can set me free
I'm not The only one who feels like this
I've got a few others around me
Hey

[Chorus:]
Hey let me hear you say
Make some noise if you feel this way
Hey if you've got a friend like that
Hey let's scream and shout
If you know what I'm talking about
Anybody got a friend like that

I once was little and
I always had a plan
You thought my friendliness
Was just an act (hey)
I'll be your friend indeed
And you can count on me
And I can guarantee
Your friend I'll always be

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

Does anyone out there feel alone?
Can anyone hear me (woh, woh)?
Down and out your heart is cold
It's never easy (woh, woh)
But if you believe that there is hope
Then sing it with me

[Chorus x2]

[Pre-chorus]
