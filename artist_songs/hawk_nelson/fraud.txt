You talk then you stop then you look at the mop-headed kid 
Who is right by your side 
He feels great as he takes all the jokes you create 
And he'll steal them with all of your lines 

Everybody thinks he's the greatest 
You know he's just a fraud 
He makes you so frustrated 
Can't wait till he gets caught 

Now he's taken all your words, 
Going through the motions as if he's never learned 
And now he's just a mirror that you see 
Without causing commotion, just stop being me 

You get up, take a walk, cuz you almost threw up 
From the way that he hits on your girl 
Find the sink, take a drink cuz there's nothing left to bring 
Bro, you know that it's already brought 

Now he's taken all your words, 
Going through the motions as if he's never learned 
And now he's just a mirror that you see 
Without causing commotion, just stop being me 

You're the scum and I'm the mountain water 
Rolling through the fields where you're not invited 
Go your own way now before it's too late 
Just stop being me 

Everybody thinks you're the lamest 
We all know you're a fraud 
Life can be so frustrating 
I'm so glad you got caught 

Now he's taken all your words, 
Going through the motions as if he's never learned 
And now he's just a mirror that you see 
Without causing commotion, just stop being me 

You're the scum and I'm the mountain water 
Rolling through the fields where you're not invited 
Go your own way now before it's too late 
Just stop being me
