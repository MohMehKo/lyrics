To everyone in the world, who's left out on their own
To all the boys and girls with disconnected souls
See the dream awakening before your very eyes
We feel alive inside for the first time
We've got to run not hide, from the former lives
We gotta take it, make it, never gonna fake it
This time we're breaking free, and making history
They say the dreams that we're chasing are just a dead-end road
We don't have to embrace the lies that we've been told
The only thing we're missing is a whole new state of mind
One day we will see through our tears and our pain
When we stand with the shame in the light
There's a hope that we know, and we can't let it go
We've got to hold on tonight
