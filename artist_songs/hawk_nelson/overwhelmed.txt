In a world of fate
Where no one seems to care
I feel so afraid but you are always there
When time stands still
And no one is around
You are there standing my ground

Cause I can feel you change my heart
You've overwhelmed me from the start
I can feel you change my mind for the better of mankind

You only take what's yours
Heaven knows I take much more
Shadows overcome my soul know you're here
