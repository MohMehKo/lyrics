We're stepping in the ring
And won't let that lady sing
It's over when we say it's over
Been brushing off our shoulders
It's not a twist of fate
We choose our own destiny
A trophy or a bruise
Champions never lose
Champions never lose

It's time to show the world
What they've waited for
Something like they've never seen before
Whooaaa
We're just getting started
We're just getting started

Reaching for the stars
We'll raise our colors high
We've come so far
Whooaaa
We're just getting started
We're just getting started

There's nothing stopping us
Yeah we're just getting started

Blasting right to the top
Making that needle drop
Do you hear that roaring crowd
Tonight we won't let them down
No time to play it safe
We'll set the record straight
This is our walk up song
Everyone's gonna sing along
Everyone's gonna sing along

It's time to show the world
What they've waited for
Something like they've never seen before
Whooaaa
We're just getting started
We're just getting started

Reaching for the stars
We'll raise our colors high
We've come so far
Whooaaa
We're just getting started
We're just getting started

It's time to show the world
What they've waited for
Something like they've never seen before
Whooaaa
We're just getting started
We're just getting started

Reaching for the stars
We'll raise our colors high
We've come so far
Whooaaa
We're just getting started
We're just getting started

There's nothing stopping us
Yeah we're just getting started
