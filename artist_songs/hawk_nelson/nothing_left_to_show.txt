Life is just a lineup, tell me when my time's up 
Too much on my mind today 
There's so much left that I would like to say 
When I start to climb up will you pull my line up or am I just in the way? 
I think about it every single day I think about it every single day 

Fix us cause we keep falling apart, just keep falling apart 
We're tired of being alone 
Fix me cause I keep falling apart, just keep falling apart 
Will someone find me
