Oh my security..
wrapped up like knots inside of me am I ever coming clean?
I see the sorrow in your eyes
Your smile is a very sad disguise
I cannot play that game tonight

Don’t ya know? 
We all have a secret,
We have friends, who try to keep them, 
I’m just a skeleton without.. you now

My own imprisonment, just like the skeleton inside,
I know the truth will set me free,
Locked in my Secrecy, I can’t comfy to me, 
Show me a cure for my disease!!

Don’t ya know? 
We all have a secret
We have friends who try to keep them 
Don’t ya know your sins will find you out..
I’m a man, a man with a problem,
I need you around so I can solve them, 
I’m just a skeleton without.. you now

I’ve been running in circles around my head,
To scared to tell you who I am,
Like a heartless Gallatin..

Don’t ya know? 
We all have a secret
We have friends who try to keep them 
Don’t ya know your sins will find you out…
I’m a man, a man with a problem,
I need you around so I can solve them, 
I’m just a skeleton without.. you now!!!!

(I want to be no skeleton!) 
(I want to be no skeleton!) 
(I want to be no skeleton!) 
(I want to be no skeleton!) 
You now!!!
(I want to be no skeleton!) 
(I want to be no skeleton!) 
You now!!
(I want to be no skeleton!) 
(I want to be no skeleton!)
