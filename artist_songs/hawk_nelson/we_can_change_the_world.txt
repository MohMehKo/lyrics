I've seen an orphan's heart filled with the Father's love
I've heard the hungry and the thirsty say I've had enough
Ya I've seen hopelessness get swallowed up in hope
When all God's people say okay here we go

We can change the world, you and me
We can make a difference if we just believe
When the hands and feet start moving together
We can change the world forever

I've seen the broken one get healed of his disease
Witnessed the beauty of forgiveness save my family
So many cities need revival of the soul
And all God's people say come on here we go, come on here we go

We can change the world, you and me
We can make a difference if we just believe
When the hands and feet start moving together
We can change the world forever

We know what we've gotta do
It's time for us to show the truth
It's up to me, it's up to you

We can change the world, we can change the world

We can change the world, you and me
We can make a difference if we just believe
When the hands and feet start moving together
We can change the world forever
