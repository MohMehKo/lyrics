I've traveled the world
Seen its diamonds and pearls
And it's not (it's not enough)
I've watched the night sky
Fill with glorious light
And it's not (it's not enough)
I could search down here
For the rest of my life
And this one thing is all that I'd find

That only You can fill my heart
The way You do
Only You can take what's worn
And make it new
So I'll take all these broken dreams
And petty things
Replace them with something that's true
I'll take them replace them with You

I've mapped every part
Of this wandering heart
And it's not (it's not enough)
I've fallen in love
Just to find out
It's never enough
So I'll set my eyes
On the one thing I know
Let this horizon
Lead me back home

Cause only You can fill my heart
The way You do
Only You can take what's worn
And make it new
So I'll take all these broken dreams
And petty things
Replace them with something that's true
I'll take them replace them with You
