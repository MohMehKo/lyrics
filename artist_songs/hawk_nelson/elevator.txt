Feelin' tired of feelin' nothin'
Feelin' stuck in the mud and I'm over it
So far down, lookin' around
And I don't know how I'm gettin' out

But hey, hey, hey
I hear You tell me not to stay, stay, stay
The door is open every day, day, day
It takes me to another place, place, place

Like an elevator
Can't stop 'cause Your love is liftin' me up
Like an elevator
I've never felt like I'm feelin' tonight
Straight off the ground, we'll never come down
Can't stop 'cause Your love is liftin' me now
Like an elevator
Like an elevator

Way up high, like I'm flyin'
And I'm finally feelin' so alive
You and I, to the sky
Gonna blow the roof off from the inside

So hey, hey, hey
I hear You tell me not to stay, stay, stay
The door is open every day, day, day
It takes me to another place, place, place

Like an elevator
Can't stop 'cause Your love is liftin' me up
Like an elevator
I've never felt like I'm feelin' tonight
Straight off the ground, we'll never come down
Can't stop 'cause Your love is liftin' me now
Like an elevator
Like an elevator (Woo!)

Here we go!
Here we go!
When we gonna stop?
No one knows
Everybody up
Get on board
You know you wanna come along for the ride
So let's go
Everyone on the flyest train
Never gonna be the same
I'm feelin' so fantastic
This party's everlastin'
So grab your friends
Push all the buttons
Ain't gonna stop until we get up to the top floor
Top floor
'Cause there's no way that we can feel more
Feel more
Here we go!

Like an elevator (elevator)
Can't stop 'cause You're love is liftin' me up
Like an elevator (elevator)
I've never felt like I'm feelin' tonight
Straight off the groud, we'll never come down
Can't stop 'cause You're love is liftin' me now
Like an elevator (elevator)
Like an elevator (like an elevator)

Whoa, hey, an elevator
