She shows up nervously and says
"It's time we settle up the score"
Cause all the things that I regret
Are all the things I've said before

Hard to ignore, I'd like you even more
But you're just like me

I talk behind your back
From this confidence I lack
Now is the time to make things right

But you're just like me

Just like me, just like me

I wanna sever all the ties that keep me bound throughout the night
But if I gossip all the time, these knots will never come untied

Thinking of myself, me, nobody else
And you're just like me

I talk behind your back
From this confidence I lack
Now is the time to make things right

But you're just like me

Just like me, just like me

You're not alone, you're not alone
You know we all are guilty
Join in the song and sing along
Sing the chorus with me
You're not alone, you're not alone
You know we all are guilty
Join in the song and sing along
Sing the chorus with me

I talk behind your back
From this confidence I lack
Now is the time to make things right

But you're just like me

Just like me, just like me
