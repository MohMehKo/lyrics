Next to me next to me
You are always next to me
When I'm needing you
Needing you the most
Holding on holding on
For my dear life I'm holding on
To You alone
Cause You alone are my hope

And I've had front row seats
To Your faithfulness
A spotlight shining
On Your promises
So I can't deny
Cause I've seen it a thousand times

I can count You
I can count You
Like a parachute when I fall
A lifeline when I call
You come though
And prove it's true
I can count on You
I can count on

Every word You said to me
You hold the future I can't see
So I believe no matter where I go
You give me

Front row seats
To Your faithfulness
A spotlight shining
On Your promises
So I can't deny
Cause I've seen it a thousand times

I can count You
I can count You
Like a parachute when I fall
A lifeline when I call
You come though
And prove it's true
I can count on You
I can count on

You when my strength's not enough
You when I'm looking for love
You when I'm standing on the edge
And I've got nothing left

I've got front row seats
To Your faithfulness
A spotlight shining
On Your promises
And I can't deny
You've shown me time after time

I can count You
I can count You
Like a parachute when I fall
A lifeline when I call
You come though
And prove it's true
I can count on You
I can count on You
