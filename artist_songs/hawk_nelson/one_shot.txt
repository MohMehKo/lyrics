It's 2 o'clock, your eyes are shut, 
Your phone alarm is going off 
The sun is up, you're still in bed, 
Another day gone again 

This isn't what you wanted was it 
Know you've got a pulse let's get it started 

You've got one shot, all you got take it now 
You gotta get up, get up, get up oh-wo-oh-wo-oh 
One life, live it right, keep on moving forward 
You've got one shot everybody it's your time 
I wanna see you on the other side 
You've got one shot, all you got, live out loud 
Come on wake up, wake up, wake up before it's over 

You got a truck, take a drive 
Go somewhere to feel alive 
You got a dream, say a prayer, 
A little faith will get ya there 

This is what you wanted promise 
Never go back to the way you started 

You've got one shot, all you got take it now 
You gotta get up, get up, get up oh-wo-oh-wo-oh 
One life, live it right, keep on moving forward 
You've got one shot everybody it's your time 
I wanna see you on the other side 
You've got one shot, all you got, live out loud 
Come on wake up, wake up, wake up before it's over
