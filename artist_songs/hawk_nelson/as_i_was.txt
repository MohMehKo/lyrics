Well the sun has come down
And I can't see the light
Can you believe this
I can't receive this
She was standing over there
And now she's out of sight
I can't concieve this
She seems so conceited
She's gone and I know that I need her

Understand me as I was
No mistake without a cause

Well the campfire started
She sat way over there
In her new sweater
I just gotta get her
She finaly walked apst
And I could smell her hair
So I wrote a letter
I'll never forget her
She's gone and I know that I need her

Let me ride on your wings
We share all our thoughts while we sing
We go on our way
