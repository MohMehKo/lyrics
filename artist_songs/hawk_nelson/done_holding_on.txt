Chapter 1, here's my story 
Probably not the one you wanna hear 
My world was spinning round and round 
Until my hopes they hit the ground 
Feels like I've disappeared 

I kept it hidden in my secrets 
My lies became a blur over time 
I was just too blind to see 
The truth was staring back at me 
Love is not a controlling hand 

I'm giving up my secrets, I'm giving up my faults 
Telling you I'm empty, should have know all along 
It's taken me my whole life to realize I'm wrong 
I'm giving up my secrets, I'm done holding on 

Staring backwards like a mirror 
At someone I can barely see 
The shadows of my past regrets, they disappear like silhouettes 
The son has come, I wanna be free 

I'm giving up my secrets, I'm giving up my faults 
Telling you I'm empty, should have know all along 
It's taken me my whole life to realize I'm wrong 
I'm giving up my secrets, I'm done holding on 

Done holding on
