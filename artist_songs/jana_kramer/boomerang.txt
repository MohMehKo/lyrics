Boomerang
Baby your forgetting that you’re the
One that called it quits
Save your story I already know the end
I should’ve know that you’d come
Crawling back
Only thing to do when you lose the
Best thing you ever had had
I ain't you’re boomerang
I ain't the kind of thing
That you can throw away and watch it
Circle back around
Don’t know what game you’re playing
Begging me to stay when you sent me on my way
And now you’re finding out
I’m an arrow straight in to the sun
Buck shot from a goodbye gun
A road that only runs one way
Anything but a boomerang
Now you’re second guessing
What do you expect from me
Pick up where we left off
Go back to what we used to be
You look me in the eyes and keep apologizing
But I, oh I
I ain't you’re boomerang
I ain't the kind of thing
That you can throw away and watch it
Circle back around
Don’t know what game you’re playing
Begging me to stay when you sent me on my way
And now you’re finding out
I’m an arrow straight in to the sun
Buck shot from a goodbye gun
A road that only runs one way
Anything but a boomerang
I’m a train burning down the tracks
I’m a phoenix rising from the ashes
Gone baby gone baby gone
There’s nothing left
There’s nothing left to say
I ain't you’re boomerang
I ain't the kind of thing
That you can throw away and watch it
Circle back around
Don’t know what game you’re playing
Begging me to stay when you sent me on my way
And now you’re finding out
I’m an arrow straight in to the sun
Buck shot from a goodbye gun
A road that only runs one way
Anything but a boomerang
I’m anything but a boomerang
