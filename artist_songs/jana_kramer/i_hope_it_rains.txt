I heard you got yourself a date already.
Funny thought you needed your space just five nights ago.
I'll bet you'll take her to our favorite spot,
Blanket down, on the ground, and chicken from your momma's stove,
And when you pull her in close...

I hope it rains on you,
Maybe a little bit of lightning too.
And I hope it comes a flood, lots of mud,
Messin' up your whole day.
Hey, hey..
I hope it rains.

Don't get me wrong, now I hope she's really the one.
And if it's love you know I wish you the best.
You'll probably have yourself an outside wedding,
Violins, all our friends, and her in her pretty white dress.
And right before that first kiss...

I hope it rains on you,
Maybe a little bit of lightning too.
And I hope it comes a flood, lots of mud,
Messin' up your whole day.
I hope it rains,
And I hope it rains...

I hope it rains,
Hope it pours,
I hope she's in heels, and some little white shorts.
You can't find the keys to unlock the doors...

And I hope it rains on you,
Maybe a little bit of lightning too.
And I hope it comes a flood, lots of mud,
Messin' up your whole day.
I hope it rains,
And I hope it rains.
