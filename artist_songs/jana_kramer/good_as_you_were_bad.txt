My head is poundin'
Too much red wine
I wish I didn't love it like I do
It gets to me every time

I wake up craving
This cigarette
Yeah I know they're no good for me
But I can't put 'em down just yet

I've never been held the way you held me
I've never been hurt the way you hurt me
I could handle this pain, forget your name
If you hadn't loved me like you had
Why'd you have to be as good as you were bad

I wanna hate you
I'm mad as hell
Oh, but a part of me still loves you
And hopes and prays to God you're doin' well

I've never been held the way you held me
And I've never been hurt the way you hurt me
I could handle this pain, forget your name
If you hadn't loved me like you had
Why'd you have to be as good as you were bad

They say you remember the past
Better than it really was
But there was a time when it really was
So good

I could handle this pain, forget your name
If you hadn't loved me like you had
Why'd you have to be as good as you were bad
