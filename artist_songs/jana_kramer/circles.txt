Just the thought of you around,
gets my head spinning... in circles.
Just the way you say my name,
gets my heart turning... in circles.

You got me spinning like a wheel, 
oh how you make me feel.
It's more than gold on my finger, 
it's six feet down and forever.
'Cause where I am,
is where you begin.
You picked up the pieces,
and put me together.
You're the only part of me unbroken,
and I'm going... in circles.

Every crooked little lie,
bended, connected... circles.
Every star up in the sky,
every hello and goodbye,
every moment by your side,
is the meaning of my life

You got me spinning like a wheel, 
oh how you make me feel.
It's more than gold on my finger, 
it's six feet down and forever.
'Cause where I am,
is where you begin.
You picked up the pieces,
and put me together.
You're the only part of me unbroken,
and I'm going... in circles.
In circles

Just the thought of you around,
gets my head spinning... in circles.
Just the way you say my name,
gets my heart turning, turning, turning
around and 'round again.

You got me spinning like a wheel, 
oh how you make me feel.
It's more than gold on my finger, 
it's six feet down and forever.
'Cause where I am,
is where you begin.
You picked up the pieces,
and put me together.
You're the only part of me unbroken,
and I'm going... in circles.
In circles.

Just the thought of you around,
gets my head spinning... in circles
