He said; I know I'm not the man that he imagined for his daughter
I'm not what he had in mind
He said her daddy probably dreamed about some lawyer or a doctor
But I never was that kind
We were in love and that's all that matters
You know her heart was all that I was after; he said

I'm a dandelion
She's a buttercup
I'm the clover
She's the luck
She's a painted daisy
I'm the blue grass underneath
She's all faith
And I'm the doubter
She's the sweet
And I'm the sour
We're like weeds and wildflowers

He said; I asked her back in 62
If she'd be mine forever
Let's run away and go to Vegas
She said I wanna be your wife,
But there has gotta be a preacher
I want all of God's angels to see us
We rolled the dice on life and made it
If there's a storm inside we faced it

And he said;

I'm a dandelion
She's a buttercup
I'm the clover
She's the luck
She's a painted daisy
I'm the blue grass underneath
She's all faith and I'm the doubter
She's the sweet and I'm the sour
We're like weeds and wildflowers

He said just last fall

Heaven called and the preacher asked if I would stand before the ground
And say a few last words
And on the mount'side
Misty eyed I couldn't help but notice all the daisies
As they laid her in the earth

And he said;

I'm a dandelion
She was my buttercup
I'm the clover, she will always be my luck
Now I'm going crazy
Yeah, she was my everything
She had faith, now I'm without her
Oh, our love goes on forever
How I long to be beside her
Just like weeds and wildflowers
