I kinda like you, you kinda like me
Let’s take a ride way out in the country
Tonight I’m drivin’, that’s right, you’re ridin’
Go grab your smokes and hand me my car keys

Don’t fight, you’re gonna lose
Just a coupla’ rules

You can put your hand on my knee
Lean a little bit closer to me
Whisper in my ear, kiss me on the neck
Run your fingers through my hair
Sing as loud as you want boy, I don’t care
Put your hands on the wheel or tell me where to go
But baby here’s the deal
Don’t touch my radio no

I like my boys like I like my music
Down home and country
That’s how I knew that you’d be the most fun
Here ridin’ shotgun
Don’t touch the dial, there won’t be a problem

Nothin’ wrong with rock ‘n roll
But right now I’m in control

You can put your hand on my knee
Lean a little bit closer to me
Whisper in my ear, kiss me on the neck
Run your fingers through my hair
Sing as loud as you want boy, I don’t care
Put your hands on the wheel or tell me where to go
But baby here’s the deal
Don’t touch my radio no

You can put your hand on my knee
Lean a little bit closer to me

You can put your hand on my knee
Lean a little bit closer to me
Whisper in my ear, kiss me on the neck
Run your fingers through my hair
Sing as loud as you want boy, I don’t care
Drum on the dash, let the speakers blow
But don’t you even ask
Don’t touch my radio
Put your hands on the wheel or tell me where to go
Baby here’s the deal
Don’t touch my radio
