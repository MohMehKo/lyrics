I almost didn't answer
When I saw your number
Don't you know it's 2:18 in the middle of the night
Did you fight with your girlfriend,
Could you not sleep,
Did a strong shot of whiskey leave you feeling weak?

You only want me when you're lonely
You only call me when you're down
You only want me when you're lonely,
But you can't have me now

I don't know what you expected
Did you think I'd let you,
Somehow get the best of me, with some pretty little lies?
I've made that mistake, I've let you crawl back in,
Now I don't have the heart to fall for you again

You only want me when you're lonely
You only call me when you're down
You only want me when you're lonely,
But you can't have me now

Don't tell me you love me
Don't say all the right things
You're having one of those nights, and I know what that means
So, you want me right now
But nothings really changed, you're just by yourself
And it's late, too late

You only want me when you're lonely
You only call me when you're down
You only want me when you're lonely,
But you can't have me now

You only want me when you're lonely,
But you can't have me now

You only want me when you're lonely,
But you can't have me now

You only want me when you're lonely,
But you can't have me now
