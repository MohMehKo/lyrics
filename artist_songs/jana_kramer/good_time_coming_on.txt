Mmm… yeah

My phone’s blowin’ up
Everybody wants to know what’s up
When, where, what’s the plan
Well I’ll be there as soon as I can
Yeah I feel like a good time comin’ on

Oh yeah, that’s my song
Turn it up and sing along
Trouble’s gonna melt away
Once we get to doing our thing
Yeah, I feel like a good time comin’ on

Hey y’all what you say
We get this party started
We’ve got all we need to have some fun
Right now it’s all about tonight and not tomorrow
I feel like a good time comin’ on

Yeah hey, yeah hey
Good time comin’ on yeah

Who’s that over there
I hope he didn’t see me stare
Oh Lord here he comes
Well I don’t wanna jump the gun
But I feel like a good time comin’ on

Hey boy what you say
We get this party started
We’ve got all we need to have some fun
Right now it’s all about tonight and not tomorrow
I feel like a good time comin’ on

Yeah hey, yeah hey
Good time comin’ on yeah

My phone’s blowin’ up
