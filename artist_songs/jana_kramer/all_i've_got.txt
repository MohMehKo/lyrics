I don't have one more late night front porch
"Kiss me, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it, I'm gonna change"
And I don't have an hourglass that lets me put the sand back
And love you all over only to watch it all end the same

All I've got's a taped-up box of old snapshots of you and me
And all I've got's a bunch of songs I can't put on 'cause they make me think
Of what we were and what went wrong and how we got to this
And I try and I try but goodbye
Is all I've got left to give

I don't have one tear left to fall right here
That ain't ready falling for you a hundred times

All I've got's a taped-up box of old snapshots of you and me
And all I've got's a bunch of songs I can't put on 'cause they make me think
Of what we were and what went wrong and how we got to this
And I try and I try but goodbye
Is all I've got left to give

I don't have a reason why I think of you when I close my eyes
But that don't make it any easier to stop

All I've got's a taped-up box of old snapshots of you and me
And all I've got's a bunch of songs I can't put on 'cause they make me think
Of what we were and what went wrong and how we got to this
And I try and I try but goodbye
Is all I've got left to give

Is all I've got left to give
