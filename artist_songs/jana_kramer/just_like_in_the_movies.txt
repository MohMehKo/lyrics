This is who I am
This is what you get
No time for the song and dance
No, no, no apologies
Take me as I am

This is what I did
This is what I've done
Tell me baby, are you the one?
Can you love me just the way I am?
Say you love me

Say you love me, love me not
You love me not
You say you love me
What's it gonna be?

You could be my king
I will be your queen
This could be the real thing
Just like in the movies
The perfect ending
We could be fairytaling, yeah
The kiss, the whole thing
Just like in the movies

Babe with you and me it's a two-way street
That's how it's gotta be, yeah, yeah
Taking on the good, the bad and the ugly

You say you love me, love me not
You love me not
You say you love me
What's it gonna be

You could be my king
I will be your queen
This could be the real thing
Just like in the movies
The perfect ending
We could be fairytaling, yeah
The kiss, the whole thing
Just like in the movies
Just like in the movies

Let the past be the past, no need to replay it
Falling back whenever you say it
Over and over and over again

You could be my king
I will be your queen
This could be the real thing
Just like in the movies
The perfect ending
We could be fairytaling, yeah
The kiss, the whole thing
Just like in the movies
Just like in the movies
