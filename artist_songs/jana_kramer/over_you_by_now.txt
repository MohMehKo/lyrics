Where was I when you
Figured out all those
Little doubts
Were just too much to conquer.

Where was I in that
Moment when
The curtain fell
And you knew that it was over.

Was I smilin' like a fool
Over morning coffee?
Did you know it was a lie
When you said you loved me?

[Chorus:]
I could've been two wheels up
I could've been hard-heeled strong
This could've been my last tear
You could've been so long gone.
I wouldn't be lost like this
I wouldn't be breaking down
I would've been over you by now.

What's it like to hold
All the cards
To pull
All the strings
And convince me that I'm dancing

Maybe you don't know
What love really is
'Cause baby
If you did
You wouldn't let it go so easy.

Instead of wasting all that time

I could've been two wheels up
I could've been hard-heeled strong
This could've been my last tear
You could've been so long gone.
I wouldn't be lost like this
I wouldn't be breaking down
I would've been over you by now.

I could've met someone new
I could've been over you

I could've been two wheels up
I could've been hard-heeled strong
This could've been my last tear
You could've been so long gone.
I wouldn't be lost like this
I wouldn't be breaking down
I would've been over you by now.
