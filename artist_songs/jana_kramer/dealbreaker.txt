I told you when I met ya, I told you when I kissed ya
Go ahead and blame it on the alcohol, baby
I gave you all my heart, I gave you all I had
I told you one thing that would make me go crazy
And it's that sweet perfume that's on ya
It isn't mine, honey, I warned ya

Well, that would be a dealbreaker, a game changer
A bye-bye baby, yeah, I'll see you later
Mr. Heartbreaker, a real player
A damn good liar, ain't no one greater
Now give me the keys to my door
I'm giving you what you asked for
You've got yourself a dealbreaker

Are you really on your knees?, are you really there crying?
That's funny 'cause when you were lying
Through your teeth
No, you weren't thinking about me 
And that lipstick stain, you joker,
Is all I need, the party's over

Yeah, baby, that's a dealbreaker, a game changer
A bye-bye baby, yeah, I'll see you later
Mr. Heartbreaker, a real player
A damn good liar, ain't no one greater
Now give me the keys to my door
I'm giving you what you asked for
You've got yourself a dealbreaker

You've got yourself a dealbreaker

Done, finished,
Adios, c'est la vie, the end
Do I really have to say it all again?

A dealbreaker, a game changer
A bye-bye baby, yeah, I'll see you later
Mr. Heartbreaker, a real player
A damn good liar, ain't no one greater
Now give me the keys to my door
I'm giving you what you asked for
You've got yourself a dealbreaker

You've got yourself a dealbreaker
Yeah, a dealbreaker
Yeah

I told you when I met ya, I told you when I kissed ya
