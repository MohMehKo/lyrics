Bullet!

Had the song picked out, had the preacher on call
Had my mama in tears, she didn't like him at all
But I loved him, yeah I really thought I loved him

Thank God I dodged a bullet
Thank God I didn't do it
No empty shells on the ground and you're nowhere to be found
Cause once the trigger is pulled, it's impossible to dodge a bullet

No more dragging your dark horse around on a chain
No more knock down, shouting, driving me insane
Yeah I really thought I loved him
Now I'm never thinking of him

Thank God I dodged a bullet
Thank God I didn't do it
No empty shells on the ground and you're nowhere to be found
Cause once the trigger is pulled, it's impossible to dodge a bullet

Close call, almost got shot down
Thank you for showing me what I don't want
I dodged a bullet

Thank God I dodged a bullet
Thank God I didn't do it
No empty shells on the ground and you're nowhere to be found
I dodged a bullet
Thank God I dodged a bullet
Thank God I didn't do it
No empty shells on the ground and you're nowhere to be found
Cause once the trigger is pulled, it's impossible to dodge a bullet
