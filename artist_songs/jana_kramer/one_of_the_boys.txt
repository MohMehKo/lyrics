I’m tired of these high heels
The higher they get, the more trouble I’m in
I’m sick of this makeup
Just to take it off and put it on again
I look at those boys in trucks
And think how easy that must be
I’m already ready to shotgun the Chevy
Boys are you ready for me

Gimme a ball cap with blue Levi’s
I’m hangin’ with Jack and Jim and raisin’ ‘em high
I’m might just flirt if I see something I like
Yeah I’m just one of the boys tonight

Hey there, I’m talkin’ to you, you wanna drink with me
No honey I’m buyin’, put your money away
This one is free
You might hear a few dirty words slip out of this pretty little mouth
No drama queens causin’ scenes
Just the boys throwin’ it down

Gimme a ball cap with blue Levi’s
I’m hangin’ with Jack and Jim and raisin’ ‘em high
I’m might just flirt if I see something I like
Yeah I’m just one of the boys tonight

Put me in a smoky bar with a cold drink in my hand
Light up a fat cigar ‘cause I don’t give a damn

Gimme a ball cap with blue Levi’s I’m hangin’ with Jack and Jim and raisin’ ‘em high
I’m might just flirt if I see something I like
Yeah I’m just one of the boys tonight
Yeah I’m just one of the boys tonight
