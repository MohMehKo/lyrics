I still believe in fairy tales 
I still believe in picking flowers
I still believe in getting lost in someone’s eyes
And talking for hours
I still believe in shooting stars
I still believe in midnight drives 
And butterflies you get
Right before you kiss for the very first time

Love, how many times can a heart break?
Love, how much weight can a soul take?
Love, I don’t know where you ran off to 
But love, love, love, I still believe in you.

I still believe in miracles 
I still believe in wedding rings and bibles
I still believe the best walk you’ll ever take 
Is walking down the aisle

Love, how many times can a heart break?
Love, how much weight can a soul take?
Love, I don’t know where you ran off to 
But love, love, love, I still believe in you.
Yeah, I still believe in you.

I still believe that you’ll come knocking on my door
When I least expect you to
You give me something I can hold 
You pull me through, cuz that’s what you do, 
That’s what you do love 
Yeah, that’s what you do love  

Love, how many times can a heart break?
Love, how much weight can a soul take?
Love, I don’t know where you ran off to 
But love, love, love, oh love, love, love
I still believe in you. 
Yeah, I still believe in you.
I still believe in you.
