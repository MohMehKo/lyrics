Who says we can't
Throw down, hit the town, stay out all night
Oh yeah, watch out
Let's give ‘em all something, something to talk about
Come on, come on, live it up now
Pa-pa-pop that bottle

Are you ready yeah, you ready for what I got
Let's get this good time crankin’ up real hot
Gettin’ wild country style, full throttle
Pop-pop-pop that bottle
Are you with me, come on baby, get with me
Nothin’ wrong with gettin’ little tipsy
Turn it up, come on full throttle
Pop-pop-pop that bottle

Ain't no last calls
In this life, this ride's gonna roll with us forever
Take a sip, lean in, get close, real close
We gonna taste it together
Come on, come on, live it up now
Pa-pa-pop that bottle

Are you ready yeah, you ready for what I got
Let's get this good time crankin’ up real hot
Gettin’ wild country style, full throttle
Pop-pop-pop that bottle
Are you with me, come on baby, get with me
Nothin’ wrong with gettin’ little tipsy
Turn it up, come on full throttle
Pop-pop-pop that bottle

Come on, come on, live it up now
Pa-pa-pop that bottle
Come on, come on, live it up now
Pa-pa-pop that bottle
Pop-pop-pop that bottle
Pop-pop-pop that bottle

Are you ready yeah, you ready for what I got
Let's get this good time crankin’ up real hot
Gettin’ wild country style, full throttle
Pop-pop-pop that bottle
Are you with me, come on baby, get with me
Nothin’ wrong with gettin’ little tipsy
Turn it up, come on full throttle
Pop-pop-pop that bottle
