All you people,
how the fuck are you?
All you people
most of you are Jews!
That's okay,
'cause I'm a Jew too!
A-ha!
Yakagove Breakinale,
that's my name in Hebrew can't you tell?
My dad converted but my momma's true blue,
a Jew!
Black angel flying through the sky,
Jewish demon, you know the reason why,
'cause it's a work in progress ayee!
A work in progress ayee!
