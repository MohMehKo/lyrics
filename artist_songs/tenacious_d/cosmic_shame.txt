If I was just going to say one thing to you all tonight,
I'd say, set the artist free.
I'm talking about this artist in here, set it free!
I'm saying, quit your day job!
Now, I know a lot of you people here, you're saying,
"I can't quit my day job. I've got kids to feed, Jack."
Quit your day job!
Focus on your craft, one time, before it's all over,
You've died, you've squandered it.
You fuckin' robots!

Now after a couple years of you focusing earnestly on your craft,
KG and I will swoop in, we will check out your progress,
And we will encourage you to continue!
Or we will say stop.
And then seriously, you must stop,
Or penalties will be created and enforced.
Because listen,
This is the problem.

Sometimes you follow your heart,
Sometimes your heart cuts a fart
That's the cosmic shame!
That's the cosmic shame!

And I know what you are saying now,
What makes you guys so fucking good?
I don't fucking know,
And I don't like it!
I stay up going fuck!
Why can't everybody fucking have it?
Because this is the thing,
Some people learn it on the streets,
Some people learn it in the schools,
Me and KG, we were fucking born with it, homes!
Just check it out!

[Skat]

That shit came off the top of my fucking head y'all,
Off the top of my head y'all!

Oh God!

Why, why, why?

It's the cosmic shame!
