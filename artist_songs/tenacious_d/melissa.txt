At one time I could advise,
But now I'm lost in my own pain.
The habits have captured me,
And now I feel them reign.

So easy to call you,
So easy to die another death.
I can't seem to fall through,
Won't you heat me with your breath?

Who am I kidding,
It wasn't that good.
But I've since magnified.
As well as it could,
And as well as it should.
So let it go.

From your eyes,
And I miss you.
I never kiss you, never again,
And I miss you.
