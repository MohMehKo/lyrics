Well, me and KG, 
Yeah, we're going to sing. 
A little song about a few special things, special things. 
Talking special things. 

Like when a friend gives a friend, a helping hand. 
Helps his little buddy to understand. 
That's a special thing. 
A very special thing. 
Yeah, take it JB. 

I hate to interrupt the thing. 
That Lee was singing about him and KG, 
Special things. 
What do you think this is? 
Tenacious D, 3-D, no, no, no, no. 

Like when KG hits a tin cup shot, on a Genesis golf. 
Tin Cup. 
That's a special thing. 
A special thing. 

Or when KG pops in Jenny Craig Mac and Chee, and hands it to me? 
That's a special thing (That's a special thing!)

Now one and one, and one is three. 
A rare occasion for life's Triple D. 
KG, JB, and me. 
KG, JB, and Lee. 
KG, JB, and me.
Now that's a special thing.
