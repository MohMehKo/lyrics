To be the best, we gotta pass the test
We gotta make it all the way
To the top of the mountain!
We can do it again!

To feel the high, we got to learn to fly
We got to take it to the sky
On the wings of an eagle!
You're the best in the world!

You are the best, but you say you don't know
You've got the touch, now come on let it show
You call the shots
But you know that you gots to believe in
The things that you dream in
You search for the meaning
Is very revealin'
The power of bein'
Is what you're feelin'
You gotta believe!

That you're simply the best!
