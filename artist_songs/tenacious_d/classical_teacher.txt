[J:] Hey Kage
[K:] Jables
[J:] How goes it man?
[K:] S'good... s'good
[J:] Y'know I've been thinking a lot about it, and um, I just want us to be the best fucking band in the world.
[K:] Well yeah, me too!
[J:] There's no point in doing it if we're not the best.
[K:] Well s'true. I agree with that.
[J:] I mean what, yeah we're gonna be, yeah we're really good. We're like almost as good as Arcade Fire, fuck that.
[K:] Yeah
[J:] We gotta leave those fuckers in the dust!
[K:] What, what do you...
[J:] All those fucking youngsters gotta fucking lick our boot or fuck it! Y'know what I mean?
[K:] Yeah! Yeah, well, how do we do that though?
[J:] [sigh] Dude, you need to fucking have some lessons.
[K:] What!
[J:] I know, you're really good but you gotta expand your game.
[K:] Lessons!
[J:] Y'know how Kobe in the off season would go and like, learn a fucking, y'know a Texas Two-Step or something, to add to his arsenal?
[K:] Man, yeah, that's true. That's true.
[J:] Well I've just been noticing some of your classic riffs are a little sloppy.
[K:] Really?
[J:] And I, I hope you're not pissed off at me but I went ahead and hired a dude.
[K:] Yeah? Oh no, what!
[J:] Dude, just give it a chance will you? If you don't like- ah hey! I swear, if you don't like it we'll fucking fire his ass. He's out.
[K:] Who is this guy? I never...
[J:] His name is Felix Char [?]
[K:] Urgh, what.
[J:] He's from Spain and he is the best.
[K:] Oh God...
[J:] I got him from the fucking London Phildsarmonic. (Meant to be Philharmonic)
[K:] Urgh, I just, I don't know him, it seems weird!
[J:] Will you just, will you just spend a minute with him?
[K:] OK. Alright. I'll spend a minute with him.
[J:] OK bro, he's right outside. I'm sending him in.
[K:] Oh God, OK. Why? Lessons, so stupid.
