Traps all day,
and traps all night.
Traps can snap, and rip, and bite.
Put a trap-a here,
put a trap-a there.
Traps can go most everywhere!

Traps all day,
and traps all night.
Me loves traps with all my mite!
You can sight it and forget it,
but don't ever let it get you in the arm, oh no!
It happens on the go,
be careful with that trapping toe!

You know traps are real,
and forged in steel.
Papy taught me on the trapping wheel,
these bear traps?
Shall be my master.

They clink and clank like a stab from a shank,
suddenly there hents' a stank.
It is I,
what a disaster!

Child safety is our code,
put some bear traps in the road!
Now the child can fear or fight,
we guarantee they'll snap real tight!

Well you must admit,
that it's a real man's slay.
But we'll admit it is a real man's trade.

Well you must admit,
that it's a real man's trade.
Yes, we'll admit it is a real man's trade!

Admit it's a fair trade!
