It was a big day on Jesus Ranch
Jesus Ranch
He was harvesting a big tomato
It was in the sand, alright

I'm taking a walk in the woods,
And it's nice outside
Smells of shit
Liggaguie, Lig-a-gig-a-gig-a-guie-a-ga
I come upon a silver striped mushroom and a
Fly-la-la-la-ly-la-ly! And a fly-fly

It was a big day on Jesus Ranch,
Jesus Ranch, Jesus!
I fell in love with big potato
That's when I started to dance
Yeah! In France

I'm taking a walk in the woods
Fuck yeah!
It's nice! Very, very nice!
Smells of shit
Liggaguie, Lig-a-gig-a-gig-a-guie-a-ga
I come upon a silver striped mushroom and a
Fly-la-la-la-ly-la-ly! And a fly-fly
Fly-la-la-la-ly-la-ly! And a fly,
And I'm go-owo-o-owo-o-owo-ne

I come upon a silver striped mushroom and a
Fly-la-la-la-ly-la-ly! And a fly-fly
