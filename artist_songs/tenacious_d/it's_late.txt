Well for a while it's late, 
so take another drink,
another pull,
from my pocket ass whiskey, chile!

All right!

Well in the summertime, it's late, 
to be a famous one to date,
is it the real thing?
God it's the read thing!
Wo! The real thing!

KG and me were a rock and roll band to see!
From the old school woman that you might to just have to disagree
But when we rock upon the mic and we come up with a riff or three,
It's late, but not too late,
Wa! Wa wa wa wa oh uh!

Don't masturbate, just cause it's late,
Oh oh oh uh!
Ten thousands suits couldn't stop us now when we blast through!

Oooh! Oh ho ho ha! Oh ahhh! wahh-ha-a!
