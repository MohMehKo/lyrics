Since the beginning of time
There had to be a man with a plan
To push man, forward
There was a caveman who, invented wheels
And with those wheels he pushed man forward

Someone had to come up with a new concept for life
Had to push the mighty rock upon the mountain top

Got to work it out
Got to think outside the box
You got to think outside the bun
If you want to be the magic one
Who will lead the trail, blaze the rail
Be the one that you will know must me
Genius

Everybody looks to the hero to lead the way, to change our way of life
To show us something that is meaningful, yeah
When you look to the hero you must seize the day and shine a ray of light
Gotta shine it on something that is beautiful, yeah
With the bravery to see, a new form of arts
A blazing of our consciousness, we're talking quantum leap

When you think outside the bun,
It's scary out there
There's also lots of stinky poo
But sometimes when you go outside of your comfort zone
You might find something brand new
To help the humans leap
Forward, do a simple leap
Never be they same, they leap
Across the fucking annals of time
Quantum leap, leap

Einstein, Shakespeare, Leonard Nimoy, Doctor Drew
Bell Biv DeVoe, Fran√ßois Truffaut, Moses, Tenacious D

That's a list of the people who have made the quantum leap
It gets pretty scary out there because they got to know themselves, yeah
When you look at the people who have made the quantum leap
You feel like a turd cause you haven't accomplished anything yourselves, no
With the bravery to see, a new form of arts
A blazing of our consciousness, we're talking quantum leap, leap, leap, leap
Sleep
