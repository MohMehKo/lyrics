City of Orlando,
Don't know what makes you tick.
Got a lot of theme parks,
With rides that make you sick.

City of magic,
But you shouldn't have let Jack go.
Now he's in LA snatching rings,
And making too much dough.

City of Orlando,
Don't know just where you's at.
One things for sure through,
You sure is mighty flat.

I hope to move here,
Some day when I retire.
Looking like the most of the people,
Are almost dead.

City of Orlando,
You're Florida through-and-through.
City of Orlando,
I love you.
