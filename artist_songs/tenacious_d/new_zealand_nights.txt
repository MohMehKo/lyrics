New Zealand nights,
unusual sights.
We cracked the code on the song that we wrote,
but it might be the weed.

You've got great weed,
the weed that we need.
We might buy a house and live here,
just because of your wonderful weed.

You know what you've got,
this magical spot.
You're living in heaven on earth, 
and you know that it's not just your pot.

You've got great weed,
but it's not just the weed.
You have excellent weed,
but it's not just the weed.
