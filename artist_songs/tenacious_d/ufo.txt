Rock the house with UFOs for fun,
they didn't come no harm no one!
They are not confined to Area 51.
No-oh-oh,
rock the house with UFOs for fun!
Fun fun!

How did they get here,
from oh-so far away?
I hear you mumbling,
you skeptics saying and saying,
What about a wrinkle in time?
That's how they got here,
through a wrinkle in time!

All you wide-eyed innocents men,
you need the UFO!
Just like a truckine!
Do you think you like to have a probe shove up your ass?
Do you think you'd like that?
Do you motherfucker?
Fuck!

There's no such thing as a UFO!
