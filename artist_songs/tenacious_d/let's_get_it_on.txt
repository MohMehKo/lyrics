I've been really trying, baby
Tryin' to hold onto these feelings for so long
And if you feel like I feel, sugar
Come on
OHH, come on,

Let's get it on
Ohhh, baby
Lets get it on
Let's love, sugar
Let's get it on, sugar,
Let's get it on
Ooooh

We are all sensitive people
With so much to give
Understand it, sugar
Since we got to be
Let's live, I love you

There's nothin' wrong with me lovin' you
Baby, no, no, no
And givin' yourself to me can never be wrong
If the love is true
Oh, baby

Don't you know how sweet and wonderful life can be
I'm askin' you baby, to get it on with me
I ain't gonna worry, I ain't gonna push
Ain't pushin', baby
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, baby
Stop beatin' round the bush....

Let's get it on
Let's get it on
You know what I'm talkin' about
Come on, baby, let your love come out
If you believe in love, let's get it on
Listen to me, baby
Let's get it on, eeEEEEEee
Let's get it on
Hey, heeyy

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,
Darlin', stop beatin' around the bush
Woah, come on, get it on
I'm listenin' to you
I gotta get it on
You don't have to worry that it's wrong
If the spirit moves you, make me groove you
Oh, let your love come out
Oh, get it on
Hey, heeyy
Do you know I mean it?
Do you know I mean it?
Do you give it your feelings?
So good, somethin' like the summertime
