The Osbournes, the family that came straight out of hell!
Ozzy, he's the daddy and he's ringing the bell!
Jack is the son, and he's got a big brain,
And he's got a big 'fro on his head.
Kelly is the daughter and she couldn't be no hotter,
She's sassy and she's made out of lead!
Sharon's Ozzy's wife and she saved his crazy life,
She's busting on his balls, tearing down the walls.

Osbourne family show!
It's the Osbourne's family show!
