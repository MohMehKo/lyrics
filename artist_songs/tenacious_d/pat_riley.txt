You know a lot of times when me and Kage sit down to write a song,
the ideas blast forth bleeding together like wine.
Now only once every hundred years or so,
does there come a duo with a power to change music.

So re-co-cord-en,
and pa-pa-pardon,
pardon my aim.

The music is beautiful but so is the lyrics,
that's why we got to say way to be.

Way to be!

Ben Vereen was a Raging Queen, 
but he rocked the house in Pippin, so come on.

Way to be

Kyle's giving guitar lessons now,
rocking guitar, reasonable rates,
but seriously folks,
he's teaching guitar.

There was a man with a plan and his name was Pat Riley,
he roused the troops and he said come on Mighty D,
he professed to rock The D.

Join hands, make plans
Peter Pan, it's a Caravan!

Way to be.

And with a clean block shot and a D Rebound
secret to the Magic of Life we've found
we got to count on D to be, and
we got to count on D to be, and
we got to count on D to be.
Go!
