Rivers of brown
All flowin' down
I like to say caca

Rivers of gold
Flowin' from us all
I like to say Cuervo

Rivers of white
Blastin' through the night
I like to say coco

Rivers of brown
Now they're rainin' down
On your phoney crown
Your phoney crown of brown
Fuck yeah yeah

I like to caca
And I like to pee pee
