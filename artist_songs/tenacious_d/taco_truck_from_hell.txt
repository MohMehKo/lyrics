[JB:] Try this shit on for size
[KG:] Yeah? Are you sure you -
[JB:] Lemme just try it

[Singing:]
[JB:] Oohhh
Racing down a hill
It's a taco truck
The taco truck from hell
I try to resist
He's a mean-ass bitch
He's bringin' you tacos that are straight from hell

Ooooohh 
No hohoho

Well he's pullin' on right up
(Right up right to)
To my sultry face
I start to run 
But that ensues a fuckin' chase

He runs me over
And reaches into his coat
Pulls them fiery tacos out
And forces 'em right down my throat

He keeps forcin' 'em in my gullet
Tacos, burritos too
And he will not cease to stop it
Why he's doing this 
Haven't got a clue
I'm eatin' those fiery tacos
Tacos
From the truck
From hell

Startin' to get addicted
Well my opinion is contadicted
Of the taco truck
I'm singin' bout the
Taco truck
From hell

Then he allows me clearance
To see the hell taco ingredients 
The taco's made of cat meat
And burrito's made of dog
Dinky tapeworm in my belly
I'm a hog

Well I didn't really care about them ingredients
Or the outside hellish appearance
I'm stuffin' out down
'Til the taco truck from hell moves on
Right out into town
I chase the taco truck around
'Til the break of dawn

Ga ga ga ga go
And go go ga ga gee
Those are the words that I'd definitely say to thee
Yes indeed
Aaaaaaah ooh
Gigigigigigigig gee
Gigigigigigigigigigigig

[Spoken:]
[JB:] That's it man
[KG:] We did it!
[JB:] New song!
[KG:] See, look, we got it
