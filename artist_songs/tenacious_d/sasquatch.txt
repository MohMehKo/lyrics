There were some scientists,
Trying to figure out the Sasquatch riddle,
Then they figured out there was a missing link
In search of Sasquatch,
That was a kick-ass in search of,
With Leonard Nimoy kicking out the jams, oh!

He captured imagination,
Of people all around the globe,
His name was Sasquatch so I'm told.
His legend's ancient,
In the ancient scribe of the indian tribe,
Apache tribe.

Scientists have proven that the Sasquatch, he is real.
Take a look at the plaster cast of his foot, now you know he's real.
Listen real close to the audio tape, not human no you know he's real.
Couldn't be a man in gorilla suit, no fucking way, no, you know he's real.
Real, real, real real, real, real, really real, real.

Sasquatch (Sasquatch)
We know your legend's real.
Sasquatch (Sasquatch)
We know your love is real.
Sasquatch,
You and Tenacious D, are real.
