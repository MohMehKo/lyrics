We've been sent, 
to issue all you people here a warning.
I'm not at liberty to say the details of our most peculiar warning,
Yeah!
Suffice to say, all you people here are in grave danger.

So come on!

Through the skies, he flies!
He doesn't know the reason why!
But he flies so high, you know that it's true!

Lot of times, when the elders, they smile.
An illusion, an infusion, an intrusion!
An amusement park ride!

Exploding brains, from Alzon to Zanzibar,
to the shores of ye old rustic Chinook.
Decimating the competition,
leaving in their wake, the blind ambition.
Come along children, and rock, get it on!
In whatever heinous realm that it squats,
In whatever heinous realm that it squats,
In whatever heinous realm that it squats,
That it squats, that it squats, that it squats.
