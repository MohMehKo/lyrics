Kong!
There is nothing on this Earth that is nearly as strong,
As Kong!

Kong!
In the jungle he lives, that is where he belongs,
King Kong!

Kong!
Beat the drum, light the flames, sacrifice, bang the gong!
King Kong! 

Kong!
Killing all in his path, save for that which he longs,
King Kong!

Kong!
There is nothing on Earth that is nearly as strong,
As Kong!

Kong!
In the jungle he lives, that is where he belongs,
King Kong!

Kong!
Beat the drum, light the flames, sacrifice, bang the gong!
Aah, King Kong!

Kong! Aah!
Killing all in his path, save for that which he longs,
King Kong!
