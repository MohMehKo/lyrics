[Alex:]
I'm standin' still without you
In the emptiest of fields
I wish that I could say what's on my mind

[Sierra:]
The straw that fills your heart
So you never have to feel
You say that you just need a little time

[Alex:]
Days like these I bury my
My each and every word
And hide them underneath these lonely trees

[Sierra:]
The harvest moon is wicked
I know that you've been hurt
I swear I'm here for good I'll never leave

[Alex:]
This is where it starts tonight
[Sierra:]
If you open up your heart tonight

[Both:]
You're staring out the window
And I'm out here in the street
You stand there like a scarecrow
And I'm begging you to speak
You used to be my solid ground
Now I'm drowning in the sea
And I just want to believe in you and me
I just want to believe in you and me

(Heeya! Heey! Heeya! Heey)

[Sierra:]
You used to be so full of life
Not just an empty shell
You're out there all alone I wonder why

[Alex:]
The pieces keep on falling out
And I pick them up myself
But I'd let you steal the buttons from my eyes

[Alex:]
Oh, this is where it starts tonight
[Sierra:]
If you open up your heart tonight

[Both:]
You're staring out the window
And I'm out here in the street
You stand there like a scarecrow
And I'm begging you to speak
You used to be my solid ground
Now I'm drowning in the sea
And I just want to believe in you and me
Yeah, I just want to believe in you and me

(Heeya! Heey! Heeya! Heey)
(Heeya! Heey! Heeya! Heey)

[Sierra:]
You said you'd open up for me
[Alex:]
Well nothing's what it seems to be
[Sierra:]
How can I make you feel again
[Alex:]
Only you can make me real again

[Both:]
You're staring out the window
And I'm out here in the street
You stand there like a scarecrow
And I'm begging you to speak
You used to be my solid ground
Now I'm drowning in the sea
I just want to believe in you and me
I just want to believe in you and me

[Both:]
You're staring out the window
I'm out here in the street
You stand there like a scarecrow
I'm begging you to speak
You used to be my solid ground
Now I'm drowning in the sea
And I just want to believe in you and me
Yeah, I just want to believe in you and me

(Heeya! Heey! Heeya! Heey)

[Both:]
You're staring out the window
I'm out here in the street
You stand there like a scarecrow
And I just want to believe in you and me
