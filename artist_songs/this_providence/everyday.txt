Everyday I wake up and hear you whisper my name
Maybe breathe a little prayer but it just ain't the same
Ignoring every word you say
Every word when you tell me

Woah be still
Just stay still
Woah be still
But oh God

Everybody's got something for me to do
And my head's filled with thoughts of everything but you
Cause I never listen to anything you say
And I fall in submission to everything but you everyday

I go to your house and fall on my knees
The very next morning and cry out please
Would you take this life I call my own?
Would you let your house become my home?

Woah be still
Just stay still
Woah be still
But oh Jesus

Everybody's got something for me to do
And my head's filled with thoughts of everything but you
Cause I never listen to anything you say
And I fall in submission to everything but you everyday

Yeaaah

Everyday [x3]

Everybody's got something for me to do
And my head's filled with thoughts of everything but you
Cause I never listen to anything you say
And I fall in submission to everything but you everyday
