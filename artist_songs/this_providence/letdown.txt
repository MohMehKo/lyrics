I've got those lovesick blues
and I feel it more than ever
A sinking in my chest like a ship in the blue, do do do do
She was the drug I abused
I feel a rising fever
A shaking in my sleep left me broken and bruised, do do do do

She said "you're just a let down,
Another one of my mistakes,
I never loved you anyway,
I never did and I never will..."
She said "you're just a let down,
All your friends,
They feel the same,
I never loved you anyway,
I never did and I never will"

I've got those lovesick blues
'Cause I sold my soul to the devil
She was well dressed and she knew what to do, do do do do
I'm painted crimson and blue
She was a ruthless artist
I traded my skin for cheap sex and tattoos, do do do do

She said "you're just a let down,
Another one of my mistakes,
I never loved you anyway,
I never did and I never will..."
She said "you're just a let down,
All your friends,
They feel the same,
I never loved you anyway,
I never did and I, I never will, I never will"

She sealed my fate with her conniving sugar kissin'
I took the bait, she told me I didn't know what I was missing 
She sealed my fate with her conniving sugar kissin'
I took the bait, she told me I didn't know what I was missing 

She said, "You're just a let down,
Another one of my mistakes,
I never loved you anyway,
I never did and I never will"
She said, "You're just a let down,
I finally found the nerve to say,
I never loved you anyway,
I never did, I never will, I never will"

She sealed my fate with her conniving sugar kissin'
I took the bait, she told me I didn't know what I was missing 
She sealed my fate with her conniving sugar kissin'
I took the bait, she told me I didn't know what I was missing
