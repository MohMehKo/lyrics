This weather reflects my face
rainy day
this place hurts my eyes
i think i could break down and cry
i enter each day with a sigh
its so hard to wake when theres nothing at stake

today i think im gonna break
the hours drag on for what seems like days
and my thoughts wander
i guess ill wait and ill see it through
it was all so hard but than i got you
and my thoughts wander

another day has slipped right by
ive done nothing
just watched her quiet
im stuck in here for a while
ill be a moment in your eyes
well being here is so hard to bear

today i think im gonna break
cause the hours drag on for what seems like days
and my thoughts wander
i guess ill wait and ill see it through
it was all so hard but than i got you
and my thoughts wander

da dada dada da
da dada dada
dadada
[x2]

look at me with my fake smile
it feels so wrong
you got me im on your leash
soon ill be gone
[x2]

today i think im gonna break

and my thoughts wander
i guess ill wait and ill see it through
it was all so hard but than i got you
and my thoughts wander

this weather reflects my face
rainy day
and this place hurts my eyes
