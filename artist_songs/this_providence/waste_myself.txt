Oh we could lie beneath the stars
Or watch a thousand passing cars
From the roof of this prison, yeah 

Or we could make this moment ours
And I could hold you, touch your scars
I can't believe that I have you, yeah 

I said... you, I waste myself on you
You, I'd do anything for you
Yeah, waste myself on you, yeah 

Like a feather in a hurricane
That's sweeping through my brain
I can't seem to find hope in this situation, love
Oh, so I tremble like an earthquake
Your tears a heavy rain
They drown my soul and apathy
like a flood, love
Singing now

You, I waste myself on you
You, I do anything for you
Yeah, waste myself on you, yeah yeah

You set me on fire
Now we're walking on a wire baby, a wire baby
You set me on fire
Now we're walking on a wire baby, a wire baby

You, I waste myself on you
You, I do anything for you
Yeah, waste myself on you, yeah yeah
