It's time we get out of here,
we've been dancing down a seemingly beautiful road to trouble.
Well everything feels so right,
Though we know, it's downright wrong.
Though we know, it's downright wrong.

Oh, you're so beautiful,
but I can't take what's left.

And on that day we'll say,
"Hey, baby we've made it. We're on top of the world."
And on that day,
we'll become everything we've dreamed and longed for so long to be,
on that day, baby.

Lets shine like the stars in a dark and dirty sky,
side by side we'll watch the perfect sunrise.
We've been waiting through a seemingly endless night,
well when the sun comes up I'll be all yours,
and you'll be all mine, yeah.

And on that day we'll say,
"Hey, baby we've made it. We're on top of the world."
And on that day,
we'll become everything we've dreamed and longed for so long to be,
on that day, oh,
on that day, baby.

And your name sounds so good when said with mine,
maybe we can run away and leave this troubled world behind.
Well, well thats a stupid, stupid, stupid thing to say,
cause we're so young but we're not foolish, honey.
Surely we can wait.

On that day we'll say,
"Hey baby, we've made it. We're on top of the world"
And on that day,
we'll become everything we've dreamed and longed for so long to be.
On that say, oh,
on that day, baby.
