Oh, last night
I had the most wonderful dream
I have ever had
We were dancing on the rocks
The waves crashed over us
And swept us out to sea
Oh, we were lost
But we were happy

It's not an option, baby
I'm not letting go
It's not an option, baby
It's just my imagination
It's not an option, baby
I'm not letting go
It's not an option, baby
It's just a chemical reaction
I'm not letting go

Oh, we were feeling happy
Oh, as happy as can be
We bid farewell to fishes
And we climbed the tallest tree
Swimming in the Milky Way
Painting colored skies
I kissed your face all over the place
And looked you in the eyes
And I said

It's not an option, baby
I'm not letting go
It's not an option, baby
It's just my imagination
It's not an option, baby
I'm not letting go
It's not an option, baby
It's just a chemical reaction
I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go

All the world fell away last night
Leaving you, only you and fright
I watched you float away out to sea
Said all the world fell away last night
To the tune of squeaking wheels and white light
But honey, it was just a dream
Believe me
It's not a option, baby

It's not an option, baby
I'm not letting go
It's not an option, baby
It's just my imagination
It's not an option, baby
I'm not letting go
It's not an option, baby
It's just a chemical reaction
Yeah
