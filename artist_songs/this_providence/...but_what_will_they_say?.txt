Baby I'm afraid.
Oh God I'm afraid.
What will people say?
What will they say?
Well some days I couldn't care less.
And others I'm scared half to death.
Don't wanna work so hard just to have a heart attack.

Throw my hands in the air.
As if it really matters what they say.
Can I just be myself?
Well I won't forfeit my soul for a pretty penny.
Are you listening?
Do I make myself clear?

We'll drive so far.
From one town to the next.
We got something to say.
Is anybody listening?
Does anybody care?
Yeah we got something to say.
Well some days I couldn't care less.
And others I could use some rest.
Don't wanna drive so hard just to get it off my chest.

Throw my hands in the air.
As if it really matters what they say.
Can I just be myself?
Well I won't forfeit my soul for a pretty penny.
Are you listening?
Do I make myself clear?

No I won't play the fool for you.
No I can't play the fool.
I've just got too much to say.

Throw my hands in the air.
As if it really matters what they say.
Can I just be myself?
Well I won't forfeit my soul for a pretty penny.
Are you listening?
Do I make myself clear?
