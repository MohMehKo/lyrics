I need somebody to talk to
But I pushed you away
I need somebody who understands
But it doesn't look like you're coming back

My sins caught up to you
I said my sins caught up to you
I lost the best love that I've ever known
And it doesn't look like you're coming home

Even after all my mistakes
Even after all my mistakes
Even after all my mistakes
You came through

I hate, hate, hate this place
I said I hate, hate, hate this place
But your attraction is still and cold
But I can feel the warmth of your grace
Yeah, I can feel the warmth of your grace

Even after all my mistakes
Even after all my mistakes
Even after all my mistakes
You came through
Even after all my mistakes
Even after all my mistakes
Even after all my mistakes
You came through

I believe in miracles
I believe in miracles
I believe in miracles
Yeah, I believe
(I believe in miracles)
I believe
(I believe in miracles)
I believe
(I believe in miracles)

Even after all my mistakes
Even after all my mistakes
Even after all my mistakes
You came through, yeah
Even after all my mistakes
Even after all my mistakes
Even after all my mistakes
You came through

Even after all my mistakes
Even after all my mistakes
Even after all my mistakes
You were true
