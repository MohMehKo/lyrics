They hold it all together as i stand back in envy
is there a hurting heart behind that smile
a world of hurting hearts
a few broken generations
"it's not safe, stay away from follow me's are everywhere
in a world that lacks commitment you very quickly learn 
to justify your actions so follow the truth"
but it seems like they've got it all and all i have is you
they've got it all i have is you
wait , how can i entertain these thoughts of life without you?
i'm losing my mind and with that the love of my life
i step out my door to a beautiful day and a world full of hate 
but i still hold on to a hope for you and me
yeah i still i hold on to this foolish hope
take it or leave it it's only a matter of life or death
take it or leave it it's only a matter of life or death
