She puts on a pretty dress and wears it all over town.
All over town.
Says, "I can give you what you want; escape from the pain.
My bed's already made."

Well I was searching for something but didn't know what.
And I found a whore on the corner of her street.
She wrapped her arms around me and she kissed me on the mouth.
Said, "There's more where that came from.
Oh baby there's more."

Like a lamb to the slaughter I followed her home.
Into bed with a stranger.
No one has to know.

She puts on a pretty dress and wears it all over town.
All over town.
Says, "I can give you what you want; escape from the pain.
Nobody has to know."
Stay away! Stay away!
She wants your soul.
She'll take your life.
Stay away! Stay away!
It's all secret love and the fastest way to loneliness.

I can't get enough.
But my soul is rotting.
What have I become?
I can hear the screams of her earlier victims so clearly now.

With a shake of my face I awoke and saw my fate.
All alone in the darkness.
Chained to the devil's gate.

She puts on a pretty dress and wears it all over town.
All over town.
Says, "I can give you what you want; escape from the pain.
Nobody has to know."
Stay away! Stay away!
She wants your soul.
She'll take your life.
Stay away! Stay away!
It's all secret love and the fastest way to loneliness.

I hear the beautiful voice of wisdom.
Joined by the angels, she sings.
Well her words are sweet like honey. 
And sour to my stomach.
She says, "Get on your feet.
Come dine with me in heavenly places.
Where you can hear the angels sing."

She puts on a pretty dress and wears it all over town.
All over town.
Says, "I can give you what you want; escape from the pain.
Nobody has to know."
Stay away! Stay away!
She wants your soul.
She'll take your life.
Stay away! Stay away!
It's all secret love and a slippery road to hell.
