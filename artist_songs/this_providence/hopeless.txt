Are you aware I'm fake?
Are you aware I'm everything I hate?
Does it make you proud
When I entertain a crowd?

Hell...

Does it make you feel cold
To know that I would never die for you?
I would never die for you, oh
Does it make you feel cold
To know that I would never die for you?
I would never die for you, oh

My steady hands are stained
No amount of blood could wash my sins away
I never felt so infected
So disconnected
Lock myself away
I got nothing nice to say

Yeahhh...

Does it make you feel cold
To know that I would never die for you?
I would never die for you, oh
Does it make you feel cold
To know that I would never die for you?
I would never die for you, oh

Every time I fall for myself
I lose you just a little bit more

Does it make you feel cold
To know that I would never die for you?
I would never die for you, oh
Does it make you feel cold
To know that I would never die for you?
I would never, ever die for you
