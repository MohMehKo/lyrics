I'm finding it hard just to breathe
I'm finding it hard just to breathe without your breath of life
I'm finding it hard just to breathe in you
I can't breath, can't you see that I'm suffocating
Are you here with me now? Well everyone keeps telling me how you're the air I breathe
and everything I need is in you

I'm one step away from
Another bad decision and
I've already made up my mind
Cause I've strayed so far away from
The air that I breathe and I'm suffocating

Where am I? I can't see a thing
I'm getting swept off my feet
And where are you I can here your words resounding
Not by the wind but by the waves that drown me
- don't let go, don't you let go

Oh why didn't it occur to me
That your love goes deeper
Than my moods or reservations
And all my stupid lines like,
"I'm just not in the mood for this"
I once was blind but now I see
You're breathing your life into me

So I'll swallow all my pride
Take a deep breath and fall at your feet
So this is breathing
Breathe in you

Where am I? I can't see a thing
I'm getting swept off my feet
And where are you I can here your words resounding
Not by the wind but by the waves that drown me
- don't let go, don't you let go

Oh why didn't it occur to me
That your love goes deeper
Than my moods or reservations
And all my stupid lines like,
"I'm just not in the mood for this"
I once was blind but now I see
You're breathing your life into me

This is breathing....

I'm finding it hard just to breathe
-in you
I'm finding it hard just to breathe without your breath of life
-in you
I'm finding it hard just to breathe
-in you
I'm finding it hard just to breathe
-in you
