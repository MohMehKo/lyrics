Oh you're throwing everything you have at me.
Cheap shots, low blows. 
Will you ever let it go?
You're so pathetic, give it a rest.
You're not gonna win. 
You're never gonna win.

You love the sound of your own voice and the crown of death upon your head.
Oh c'mon.
You in all your royalty only adds to infamy.
You're going to taste my fist.

You're so good at stretching the truth into a sugar-coated lie.
Everyone takes a bite.
I have been dining with the enemy.
It was a wolf in sheep's clothing.
Now it's so clear to me.

I've had enough of your games.
If you're not trembling, you better be.
'Cause we're gonna be the end of you.
I've had enough of your games.
I'm gonna show them who you really are.
And I can tell you right now, it won't be pretty.

You say, 'I can convince anyone anything.'
Provoking the anger of a jealous God.
Still you spin a web of lies, fear, lust, pride, greed and shame.
You say no one.
Oh you say no one escapes the pain.

I've had enough of your games.
If you're not trembling, you better be.
'Cause we're gonna be the end of you.
I've had enough of your games.
I'm gonna show them who you really are.
And I can tell you right now, it won't be pretty.

I'm a coward not a fighter, disguised as a lover.
In disguise, in disguise.
For so long now you've held me down.
You held me, you held me down.
You held me down, you held me down for so long but it's not gonna last.
'Cause I can see right through your beautiful lies (and those eyes for that matter).

I've had enough of your games.
If you're not trembling, you better be.
'Cause we're gonna be the end of you.
I've had enough of your games.
I'm gonna show them who you really are.
And I can tell you right now, it won't be pretty.

Oh you're throwing everything you have at me.
Cheap shots, low blows. 
Will you ever let it go?
You're so pathetic, give it a rest.
You're not gonna win. 
You're never gonna win.
