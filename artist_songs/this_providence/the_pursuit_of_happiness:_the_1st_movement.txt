In the heat of another busy day he said,
"What on earth am I doing here anyway?
I've spent all my attention on the world and its distractions.
I've no time for reflection.
No, I just go, go, go.
It's just go, go, go."

In the heat of a conversation it was said,
"I've got all these good intentions.
I just don't have the time."
We all wish for more.
And more hours in a day.
But I think it's safe to say.
We just need to breathe and slow down.

Slow down, slow down.
Slow down and ask yourself right now.
Slow down, you're falling asleep in traffic.
Slow down, you're losing your soul.
Slow down, where are you taking yourself now?

I just wanna be happy.
But I can't quench my thirst.
I'm always missing something.
Maybe I just need more.
Or maybe I should just breathe and slow down.

Slow down, slow down.
Slow down and ask yourself right now.
Slow down, you're falling asleep in traffic.
Slow down, you're losing your soul.
Slow down, where are you taking yourself now?

When I fall asleep I dream of happiness.
In numbers and dollar signs.
And when I awake, it's only one prize away.
I've never known anything else.

Slow down, slow down.
Slow down, where are you taking yourself now?
