I lay in my bed
and think of all that was said and done
It's 2 in the morning
my mood swings are boring to you now
You just drive away
now we don't think I mean it
when I say sorry
Cause I've already said it 
too many times
sorry, my bad

I never wanted us to be like this
I never dreamed of me treating you like this
I'm trying to find a way out of this mess
that I guess I got us in on my own

I hung up on you tonight
for my first time
in a fight
what ever happened to
"you hang up" 
"no you hang up"?

I never wanted us to be likes this
I never dreamed of anything but a pure kiss
I'm trying to find a way out of this mess
that I guess we got us in ourselves

Please hold on to me
I'm begging you
and I'm on my knees again
I know you have every right to leave me
but sweetie, will you hang on to me?

Let me just say this to you
I know we can pull through
we're always given a way out of these temptations

I never wanted us to be like this
