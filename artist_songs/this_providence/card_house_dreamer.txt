My world is falling apart.
I was a fool, I never saw it coming.
Oh no, no.
My life is like a card house.
A delicate construction
With no regard for the wind.

Everybody's changing.
Oh everybody's changing.
And I don't know know know know know how much more I can take.

I thought I had everything under control.
I couldn't have been more wrong.
I thought I held my world in my hands.
Until it broke and I awoke from this foolish dream.

I put so much of myself in everything else.
Yeah in everything else.
It was a dream come seemingly true.
Torn at the seams revealing a nightmare.

I thought I had everything under control.
I couldn't have been more wrong.
I thought I held my world in my hands.
Until it broke and I awoke from this foolish dream.

I thought I had everything under control.
I couldn't have been more wrong.
I thought I held my world in my hands.
Until it broke my heart.
Everything I loved had changed.

Coffee and cigarettes can't save me.
No, it's a hope where there's no chance of a hope in the world. 
And I'm hoping for. (I'm hoping for)

I thought I had everything under control.
I couldn't have been more wrong.
I thought I held my world in my hands.
Until it broke and I awoke from this foolish dream.

I thought I had everything under control.
Well, I couldn't have been more wrong.
I thought I held my world in my hands.
Until it broke my heart.
Everything I loved was flawed.
