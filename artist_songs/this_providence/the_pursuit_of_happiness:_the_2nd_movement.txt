I know, I know, 
I know the secret to your happiness.
Oh I know, I know.
Take a deep breath, there's only one way.
Give all you have away.

Well you've wasted.
You've wasted so much time.
Trying to buy what you can't buy.
(You can't buy happiness)
And if you really wanna live.
I'm gonna have to let it go.
I'm gonna have to give it all.

Oh God it hurts.
But when I count the cost.
It all seems worth it all.
God, it's a fight and I just might.
I might just let it all go.

The only thing that I've been feeding.
Is my American dream.
But it's never satisfied.

We're all overweight and comfortable.
But I saw a need on my big screen TV.
It shook me and questioned my integrity.
And it called me to be more than I'd ever dreamed.

It called me to give my whole life.
Well that's what I'm gonna do.
