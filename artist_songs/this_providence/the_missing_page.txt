Lay in my bed
think of all that was said
and done
its two in the morning
my mood swings are boring you out
you just try to wait
no i dont think i need it
i say sorry
but ive already said it
too many times
sorry my bad

i never wanted us to be like this
i never dreamed of me treating you like this
im trying to find a way out of this mess
that i guess i could have saved
on my own

ill up and leave tonight
for my first time
in a fight
whatever happened
do you hang up now
you hang up

i never wanted us to be like this
i never dreamed of anything but gave you a kiss
im trying to find a way out of this mess
that i guess we could have saved
ourselves

please hold on to me
im begging you im on my knees again
i know you have every right to leave me
but sweety...will you hang on to me

let me say just this to you
i know that we can pull through
we're always given a way out
of these temptations

i never wanted us to be like this
