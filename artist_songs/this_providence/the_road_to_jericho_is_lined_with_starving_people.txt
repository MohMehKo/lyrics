There's a man on the side of the road.
Left for dead.
People passing by turn their head.
There's a man on the side of the road to Jericho.
Needs a friend.
Oh we all could use a little more loving.
Couldn't we?
So c'mon love. 
Give your love away with me.

Hold nothing back.
Like you've nothing to lose.
Love with all you have. 
Like you don't have a clue what it's costing you.

There's a man on his way to a church.
Avoids the eyes of a dying soul.
He just turns his head.
There's a child on the side of the road to Jericho.
Needs a friend.
Oh we all could do a little more loving.
Wouldn't you agree?
So c'mon love.
Give your love away with me.

Hold nothing back. 
Like you've nothing to lose
Love with all you have. 
Like you don't have a clue what it's costing you.

If loving were easy it wouldn't be love.
Oh will you give your love away?
If loving were easy it wouldn't be love.
I'm gonna give away love.
Will you give your love away?
