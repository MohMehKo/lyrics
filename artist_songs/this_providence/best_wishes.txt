Your words hit harder than expected
i couldnt sleep because my dreams were interrupted
by the bittersweet fragrance of our childhood dreams
filling my heart but its a world torn apart
we thought we had what no one could ever have
invincibility
but a distance between you and i killed us
gradually
a spoonful of your sarcasm helps the pain go down
but if you wanna mend my heart for a while it'll take a phone call from your side of town

now were left with broken hearts and a handful of memories
and who i am now reflects you somehow
cause you're so apart of me
its not like were over is it?
its not like we'll never be together
i hate it, the way that you say "never"

the snow falls here
you can see the stars where you are searching for the inspiration
that we once found in every moment we shared 
all our deepest dreams
on a train of thought that took us to the place of common ground
but the stage was only set for a disappointment

now were left with broken hearts and a handful of memories
and who i am now reflects you somehow
cause you're so apart of me
its not like were over is it?
its not like we'll never be together
i hate it, the way that you say "never"

and now were left here
two seperate paths
you'll take yours and i'll take mine
we're left with broken hearts
growing older and growing apart
