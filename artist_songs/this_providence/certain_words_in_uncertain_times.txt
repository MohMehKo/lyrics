While forever seems to take its time
we're still standing here in line waiting for the sun to rise
as she looks on she's so confused
her heart is lonely broken and bruised
a closed circle with no more room for one more, screams "to hell with you"

what's wrong with this picture?
what's wrong with this picture?
did you ever stop to think a thief in the night has come to steal your loved ones?
did you ever take the time to see the world around us is falling apart?

eyes closed
we've all had our eyes closed
our hands behind our back we run and hide
from everything that moves
from everything that might put out this little light of mine

what's wrong with this picture?

did you ever stop to think a thief in the night has come to steal your loved ones?

where did our hero go and who did he dine with?
we say the world's gonna end in the end anyway
and anyway
i'm ok so it doesnt concern me

and did you ever stop to think a thief in the night has come to steal your loved ones?
and did you ever take the time to see the world around us is falling apart?
