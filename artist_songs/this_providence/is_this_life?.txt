7:30 monday morning the stories began
you make it sound like so much fun
just spend the weekend throwing yourself away
throwing yourself away [x3]

this is how you live your life
throwing yourself away
is this how you want youre life
throwing yourself away

11:30 friday evening the nights still young
you hope tonight that its a special one
death is on the way throwing whats sacred away
throwing yourself away
throwing whats sacred away
throwing yourself away

you just added a book to youre life
throwing yourself away
is this really even life
throwing yourself away

at the end of the day where will you be
what will you have done
get up and wake up this morning having fun
at the end of the day where will you be
what will you have done
get up
wake up this morning having fun

this is how you live your life
throwing yourself away
is this really even life
throwing yourself away

ask yourself right now [x2]
where are you going
ask yourself right now
where are you going
where are you going
ask yourself right now
where are you going
