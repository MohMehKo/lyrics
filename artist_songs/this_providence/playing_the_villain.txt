You're so pretty
Such a must-see
Dress yourself in jealousy
Self-appointed gift from above

You would make a killin'
Playing the villain
Well, I hate who you've become
I don't know you anymore
Who are you now?
I don't know
Who are you now?

This ain't gonna last forever
So come on back down my way, baby
This ain't gonna last forever
Nobody should want you
Will want you back

You're so shallow
Got those looks, though
On his face
It sells the show
You think you're changing the world

You would make a killin'
Playing the villain
Well, I hate who you've become
I don't know you anymore
Who are you now?
I don't know
Who are you now?

This ain't gonna last forever
So come on back down my way, baby
This ain't gonna last forever
Nobody should want you
Will want you
Destiny's an open map
So tell me, baby
Where's your head at?
This ain't gonna last forever
Nobody should want you
Will want you back

Hey, you're pushing me away
Hey, you're pushing me away
Hey, yes, you are

This ain't gonna last forever
So come on back down my way, baby
This ain't gonna last forever
Nobody should want you
Will want you
Destiny's an open map
So tell me, baby
Where's your head at?
This ain't gonna last forever
Nobody should want you
Will want you back
