Who would I be?
Where would I be going if I didn't have you to shake my face?
Why do you care?
Why do you care so much?
Your love's such a stretch for my faith.

You don't let go easily.
No, you hold onto me tight.
And it's just what I need.
To get me through the storm tonight.

Whoa, I don't have to be afraid of the wind.
And that's good to know.
'Cause I've heard it all before.
But I'm walking on water now.
In the midst of a storm.

My life fell apart and you were right there.
The fire turned my whims into smoke.
I choke on your words that somehow make sense.
And I dance with a joy only found in the pain.

You don't let go easily.
No, you hold onto me tight.
And it's just what I need.
To get me through the storm tonight.

Whoa, I don't have to be afraid of the wind.
And that's good to know.
'Cause I've heard it all before.
But I'm walking on water now.

Whoa, I don't have to be afraid of this sinking ship.
And that's good to know.
'Cause I've heard it all before.
But I'm walking on water now.

Take me away to a heavenly place.
Rescue me my love, my saving grace.

Whoa, I don't have to be afraid of the wind.
And that's good to know.
'Cause I've heard it all before.
But I'm walking on water now.

Whoa, I'm singing in the rain.
Well that's a joy I've never known.
'Cause I've heard it all before.
But I'm walking on water now.
