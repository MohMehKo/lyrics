Well, I couldn't stand to be in that place
I was just about to leave
When I saw your face
You were laughing at me
With your beautiful mouth
You said, "You're looking miserable
Do you wanna get out?"

When you're only eighteen
And you have nothing to lose
And you're living a dream
With the sand in your shoes
You said falling in love is easy
It's easy to do

We fell in love
With the windows rolled down
Chasing the sunset
Through another empty town
Your hair was a mess
When you would dance on the coast
Your silhouette
Like some heavenly ghost

When you're only eighteen
And you have nothing to lose
And you're living a dream
With the sand in your shoes
You said falling in love is easy
It's easy to do

Summer skies
And warm colored sunsets
And a sunrise
Sneaking through my blinds
My demise
Well, I just can't help
But feel so lost

Falling in love is easy to do
With the wind in your hair
And the sand in your shoes
And though it may hurt
To have your heart broken in two
That didn't stop me from falling for you

When you're only eighteen
And you have nothing to lose
And you're living a dream
With the sand in your shoes
You said falling in love is easy
It's easy to do

Yeah, when you're dancing on the beach
Where the water meets your feet
And a cool ocean breeze
You're fighting the heat
Falling in love is easy
It's easy to do
It's easy to do
Oh, I'm falling for you
