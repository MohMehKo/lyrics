I've been jumping from the tops of buildings
For the thrill of the fall
Ignoring sound advice
And any thought of consequence

My bones are shattered
My pride is shattered
And in the midst of this self-inflicted pain
I can see my beautiful rescue

I'm falling more in love with every single word I withhold
I'm falling more in love with every single word you say
I'm falling head over heels for you

I've been dancing on the tops of buildings
At the top of my lungs
I'm singing you a song
Don't you leave me alone

My bones are shattered
My pride is shattered
Well I'll trample my pride 
And tell the whole world to dance with me

I'm falling more in love with every single word I withhold
I'm falling more in love with every single word you say
I'm falling head over heels for you again

I'm crying out
Wash my hands, these bloody hands lord
Open my mouth and I'll sing


I'm falling more in love with every single word I withhold
I'm falling more in love with every single word you say
I'm falling head over heels for you

I'm falling head over heels for you again

I'm falling more in love with every single word I withhold
I'm falling more in love with every single word you say
I'm falling head over heels for you again
