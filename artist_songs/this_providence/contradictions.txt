So hard to say this to you
once again my love fell through
how could i do this to you
the last time i promised you
and you say

"theres so much that i see
when you are not around me
so many words that you say
are contradictions
and how could you say you love me
when you dont even seem to find me
and i just want to set you free
of these addictions"

you cry as i tell you
when did i
why did i
how could i
i sigh as i tell you
all the things i used to do
and you say

"theres so much i didnt see
when you are not around me
so many words that you said
were contradictions
and how could you have said you love me
when there were all those things i couldnt see
well i knew
that there was something up with you"

something wrong
something not right
[x4]

is there anything i dont see
when you are not around me
are any words that you say
contradictions
and do you still love me now
well i dont understand how
you forgive me somehow
of these convictions

and you forgive me endlessly
but i dont think that you understand all this
and love me unconditionally
but i know ill learn from this
[x2]

i know i learned from this [x4]
