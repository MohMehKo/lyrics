I woke up this morning
i found that i had
a smile on my face
i asked myself whats this for
and i remembered you
and i thought of you

reality
you barely know me
i want to know you
i want to sit beside you
and talk about anything
i wanna be with you
everyday with you
but that
that wont happen
that probly wont happen
no way
no way

but then i recall last nights drama
i got frustrated
than i went back to sleep
my dreams were of you
and your pretty face
when i got up
i wanted to get out of bed
and go to your place

but
you barely know me
i want to know you
i want to sit beside you
and talk about anything
i wanna be with you
everyday with you
but that
that wont happen
that probly wont happen
no way
that'll be the day

but can i just say
i think youre wonderful, wonderful
yeah
but can i just say
i think youre wonderful..wonderful

but you barely know me
i want to know you
i want to sit beside you
and talk about anything

but that
that wont happen
that probly wont happen
no way
that'll be the day

because you barely know me
and i want to know you
i want to sit beside you
and talk about anything
i want to be with you
everyday with you
but that
that wont happen
that probly wont happen
no way
that'll be the day
no way
