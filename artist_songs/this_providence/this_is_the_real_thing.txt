I got a lot of love to give
If you wanna make something sweet
Heaven forbid we should miss a chance to move our feet
My heart beats to the rhythm of your heart, baby, baby
My heart beats to the rhythm of your heart, come on

I will love you just the way you are
Don't, don't you change yourself
I will love you just the way you are
Don't, don't want no one else
Diamonds in the moonlight, dancing on the sea
I would never change anything
I will love you just the way you are
Don't, don't you change yourself
Break my heart a thousand times
And I'll come back for more

Tell me honey, what's your drug?
For self-medicating heartache
I'd tell you, all you need is love
But didn't love break you in the first place?
Gossip magazines are making us stupid
And Hollywood pompous dreams are leaving us cold, come on

I will love you just the way you are
Don't, don't you change yourself
I will love you just the way you are
Don't, don't want no one else
Diamonds in the moonlight, dancing on the sea
I would never change anything
I will love you just the way you are
Don't, don't you change yourself
Break my heart a thousand times
And I'll come back for more

Pull me and push me in 'til I hear you singing
'Cause this is the real thing

Gossip magazines are making us stupid
(Pull me and push me in 'til I hear you singing) 
And Hollywood pompous dreams are leaving us cold
('Cause this is the real thing)

I will love you just the way you are
Don't, don't you change yourself
I will love you just the way you are
Don't, don't want no one else
Diamonds in the moonlight, dancing on the sea
I would never change anything
I will love you just the way you are
Don't, don't you change yourself
Break my heart a thousand times
And I'll come back for more, hey
Break my heart a thousand times
And I'll come back for more
