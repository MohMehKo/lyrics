Hey, hey I could run away.
Run away from everything I know.
I know I shouldn't feel this way.
Because really, I gotta get away from me.

Is there any hope for a boy like me?
Is there any, any hope for me?

There's gotta be.

And yeah, well I can hear you say,
"Anything is possible."
But my life is such a mess.
And we've already been through this.
And though we've been here before.
Anything is possible.
So many years all alone in the dark.
Well it's time to get out.
It's time to get out.

Hey, hey I danced away.
Countless nights with demons out of sight.
And I took to their foolish games.
But really, I gotta get myself out of this scene.

Is there any hope for a boy like me?
Is there any hope for me?

There's gotta be.

I'm so ready to be free.
And yeah, well I can hear you say,
"Anything is possible."
But my life is such a mess.
And we've already been through this.
And though we've been here before.
Anything is possible.
So many years all alone in the dark.
Well it's time to get out.
It's time to get out.

I'm hoping on an overwhelming grace.
I'm praying for this dream to come true.

And yeah, well I can hear you say,
"Anything is possible."
Even cleaning up a mess like me.
Well it's time to get out.
It's time to get out.

And yeah, well I can hear you say,
"Anything is possible."
But my life is such a mess.
And we've already been through this.
And though we've been here before.
Anything is possible.

And yes, I'm a mess.
I'm lonely and dirty.
But it's time to get out.
It's time to get out.
