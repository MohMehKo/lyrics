I'll run and hide under my bed
you're calling my name from outside my door but i'm not ready yet
for a revolution to start in me

'cause i'm just scared of losing control
i'm terrified of who i'll become with you
i'm just scared
the world hates you and it's gonna hate me too

a cry for help rings in your ear
i'm calling your name from inside this hole that i've dug myself into
it's so wrong
my self-centered prayers as if you don't care for anyone but me
give me a day
that's all it takes for me to turn my back on you

'cause i'm just scared of losing control
i'm terrified of who i'll become with you
i'm just scared
the world hates you and it's gonna hate me too

the whole world hates us
the whole world hates our song
but still we sing
but still we sing along

so here i am
a wary heart and trembling hands
waiting for the words to leave your lips
so here i am
a wary heart and trembling hands
waiting for the words to leave your lips

(this could be the hardest step that i'll take)

here i am
a wary heart and trembling hands
waiting for the words to leave your lips
(this could be the hardest step that i'll take)

the whole world hates us
the whole world hates our song
but still we sing
but still we sing along
('cause i'm just scared of losing control
i'm terrified of who i'll become with you
i'm just scared
the world hates you and it's gonna hate me too)
