"Sorry i'm just tired,"you said
i made a scene and you replied
"sorry that i'm tired, but can i just see you smile?"
what was going through my head as we laid on the phone in our beds?
you always felt like you were wrong

sorry you're tired
'cause i've been keeping you up half the night and bathing in your tears
'cause i've been oh so scared to lose you and holding on too tight
while i've been spoon-fed my fears

if only i could love the way you do
you forgive me in a heartbeat of this heart that beats for you
well tomorrow's a new day and i can't wait to prove myself to you
i'll prove myself to you
i'll prove myself to you
i'll prove myself to you
i'll prove myself to you
i'll prove myself to you
i'll prove myself to you
