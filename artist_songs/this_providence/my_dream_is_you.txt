Do you even know
what you mean to me
well im at a loss for words
do you even know
you make me so happy
well im at a loss for words

what can i say
what can i do
to let you know
how much i treasure you

i could be with you
an hour or two
and not even say a word
we can sit and talk
the day away
and we still have more to say

what can i say
what can i do
to let you know
how much i treasure you

how can this be
its too good to be true
its you and me
sweetheart
my dream is you
my dream is you
my dream is you
my dream is you

and when i doubt
how do you do it
you give the perfect words
and just the way you live your lie
well im inspired

when you
hold my hand im free
and when you kiss my cheek
you melt me
you melt me
you melt me

my dream is you [x4]
