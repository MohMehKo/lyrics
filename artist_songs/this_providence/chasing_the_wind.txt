I am floating away, lost in a space of my own
And I am floating in space, lost in hallucinations

You should have known I was dangerous
When I found the keys on the stairs
And hardly made it through the front door
I was wondering if anyone cared

(ooh, ooh)
A pink painted tree house in a weeping willow
(ooh, ooh)
This is where I go

Nothing matters, I'm just chasing the wind
Nothing matters, I'm just chasing the wind
If I can't have you, darling

I was just passing your house by
Sorry I didn't ring, do you think I could come in?
I was somewhere taking flight
As high as kite, cut from a string

You should have known I was dangerous
But fate has a way with these things
Like vultures that circle a carcass
Were the demons that wait to feed on my sin

(ooh, ooh)
A pink painted tree house in a weeping willow
(ooh, ooh)
This is where I go

Nothing matters, I'm just chasing the wind
Nothing matters, I'm just chasing the wind
If I can't have you, darling

Don't take me home
Don't let me go
'Cause I should not be alone
Don't take me home
Don't let me go
'Cause I should not be alone
'Cause I should not be alone
I should not be alone

Nothing matters, I'm just chasing the wind
Nothing matters, I'm just chasing the wind
If I can't have you, darling
