I find myself so tangled up.
In all of our ideas.
We could run away, get a job.
In a small town on the beach.

We can dream but I can't stay.
It's a small world.
But I'll still sail much too far away.
Could it be, it was destiny?
You and me, an ocean between?

I find myself a bit of a mess.
Life just isn't fair, is it?
I miss the years when we were young,
Innocent and so na√Øve.

We can dream but I can't stay.
It's a small world.
But I'll still sail much too far away.
Could it be, it was destiny?
You and me, an ocean between?

Pride burns like wildfire.
Smell the smoke rising.
It's the anthem of hell.

In your eyes I saw a hope.
Where you wrote us off as Pharisees.
You were so relieved.
Don't listen to anything these demons have to say.
We're older now and it's time to grow up.

Breathe in, breathe out.
Throw yourself in the sea.
(It's so much bigger than us.)

We can dream but I can't stay.
It's a small world.
But I'll still sail much too far away.
Could it be, it was destiny?
You and me, an ocean between?

Don't listen to anything they have to say.
We're older now and it's time to grow up.
