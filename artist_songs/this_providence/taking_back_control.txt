I am sick of always trying
but not trying hard enough

i am sick of always trying
but not trying hard enough
i am done with the weak end
who cant even control himself

im taking back control
bring me back to you
let me know that youre still the one that i hold onto
bring me back to you
i know it wont be long i cant go on without you

everything i know
says youll be there
everything ive learned
says you will care
now every little thing that means the world to me
every little thing that probly doesnt matter at all

sick to death of all my cheap talk
when will i just follow you
done with trying on my own
cause its not worth me i need you

we're gonna pull myself together
bring me back to you
let me know that youre still the one that i hold onto
bring me back to you
i know it wont be long i cant go on without you

everything i know
says youll be there
everything ive learned
says you will care
now every little thing that means the world to me
every little thing that probly doesnt matter at all

i need you
i want you
i love you
i was before you
to need you
to want you
to love you
i was before you

bring me back to you
let me know that youre still the one that i hold onto
bring me back to you
i know it wont be long i cant go on without you
[x2]

and everything i know
says youll be there
and everything ive learned
says you will care
about how every little thing that means the world to me
and every little thing that probly doesnt matter at all
im taking back control [x7]
