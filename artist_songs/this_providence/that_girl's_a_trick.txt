You've got me wrapped around your finger,
Wrapped around your finger,
Oh, I gladly wear this noose around my neck

Well, I do not know you yet,
I do not know you yet,
You don't know my first name,
But I, I-I found you
Just in time

I can't get her out of my head,
And it drives me crazy,
"That girl's a trick", my friends said,
But she drives my crazy

Honey this is unkind,
You're taking over my mind,
This'll be my demise,
And I'll take you out for a drive,
You're taking over my mind,
And it drives me crazy

Oh, she is a brown haired in a black and white dress,
I've never been so obsessed,
When it comes to mistakes, honey, you take the cake

Well, I do not know you yet,
I do not know you yet,
You don't know my baby, honey,
But I found you,
Just in time to save my life,
I found you,
Just in time to same my Friday night

I can't get her out of my head,
And it drives me crazy,
"That girl's a trick", my friends said,
But she drives my crazy

Honey this is unkind,
You're taking over my mind,
This'll be my demise,
And I'll take you out for a drive,
You're taking over my mind,
And it drives me crazy

This is how it feels to be the victim of a spell (victim of a spell)
So beautiful and tragic,
Poetic and romantic,
This is how it feels to be the victim of a spell
So beautiful and tragic,
Poetic and romantic,

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I can't get her out of my head,
And it drives me crazy,
"That girl's a trick", my friends said,
But she drives my crazy

Honey this is unkind,
You're taking over my mind,
This'll be my demise,
And I'll take you out for a drive,
You're taking over my mind,
And it drives me crazy
