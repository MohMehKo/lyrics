Darling, are you dreaming?
Are you dreaming of me now, now?
Oh, screaming
Are you screaming?
'Cause it's such a nightmare now, now

Oh, must be, must be
Something else waiting for you, oh
Must be, must be
Something else waiting for you, oh

I, I can't keep on without you
I, I can't keep on without you

Leaving
Are you leaving
When I need you here the most?
Oh, I need you more than ever
All I have is your holy ghost, oh

Oh, must be, must be
Something else waiting for you, oh
Must be, must be
Something else waiting for you, oh

I, I can't keep on without you
I, I can't keep on without you
Without you

You paint my broken heart
Like some awful piece of art
And I watch my world
As it falls down around
But still I pray
You will come back some day

I, I will keep on without you
I, I will keep on without you
I, I will keep on without you
Without you
