Silly girl
You don't look so good
There's nothing here that makes you feel the way you should
The summer's gone and you've lost your way
Why hide your heart 
You know It's always such a waste
Seeing you cry and it makes me sad
Makes me think that I should hold you everyday
Miss you always
Even if you hit the ground
Miss you always
Even if you're here to play

Silly girl
It's just a way to go
There's nothing cool that makes my heart stay away
I've seen you cry and it makes me sad
Don't hide your eyes
You know it's always such a waste
Miss you always
Even when you hit the ground
Miss you always
Even when you're here to play
