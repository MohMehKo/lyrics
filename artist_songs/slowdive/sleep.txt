I can see you laughing
Through dreams of perfect sleep
Sleep away from me 
You know what's in my mind
When you go I'm crying
Dream dream away from me

When the Lord embrace you
Bow down, spare the reed [?]
When I close my eyes
Your fate shall be free
When I see you drowning
I'll dream dream away from you
