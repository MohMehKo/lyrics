Today
I lost a colors fray 
Watch the games you play
And when it all falls down, yeah
Don't forget the days
When the sunshine fades away

Remember what they say
Remember what they say

The right time
She calls
Today
Every time she says she's falling
And every time she call us friends

Because
To the right time
She calls
Today
Every time she says she's falling
Every time she call us friends
I can't believe
She says she's leaving
Can't believe
(...Disgusted...)
(...Disgusted...)
I can't believe it
(...Scares me...)
(...Can't believe it...)
Can't believe...
