She wakes up on her own
And opens her eyes
The sun tries to burn through the pain
She still feels inside

I've seen you fall apart
I know you wouldn't care
But I wish you were mine

She looks into his face
Just to be near him
And the clouds come round again
Nothings changed

I saw you for a lifetime
I know I shouldn't care
But I wish you were mine
And the rain keeps on falling
In my heart.
