Listen close and don't be stoned, I'll be here in the morning
'Cause I'm just floating
Your cigarette still burns, your messed up world will thrill me
Alison, I'm lost

Alison, I said we're sinking
There's nothing here, but that's okay
Outside your room, your sister's spinning
But she laughs and tells me she's just fine
I guess she's out there somewhere 

And the sailors, they strike poses, the TV-covered walls
Answer slowly
With your talking and your pills, your messed up life still thrills me
Alison, I'm lost

Alison, I'll drink your wine
I'll wear your clothes when we're both high
Alison, I said we're sinking
But she laughs and tells me it's just fine
I guess she's out there somewhere
