Last time I saw you
The sun shined
Would you miss me?
You're never far, a window

I can't believe that I should care now
All the sorrow in your heaven
I thought this song would dry your eyes
And I'm sorry to have missed you

Drive away
On your summer's day
I'll drive away
On your summer's day

I'll drive away
On your summer's day
I'll drive away
On your summer's day

I'll drive away
On your summer's day
Drive away
On your summer's day

I'll drive away
On your summer's day
