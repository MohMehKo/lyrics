You know why
What an honor (You're so hard to reach)
In my head

Follow my (You're so hard to reach)
What an honor
Falling down (You're so hard to reach)
What an honor

You say, "Love," and it sounds so good
You say, "Love," and it sounds so sweet

You say you love me
You know why
What an honor (You're so hard to reach)
In my head

Follow my (You're so hard to reach)
What an honor
Follow my (You're so hard to reach)
What an honor

You say, "Love," and it sounds so good
You say, "Love," and it sounds so sweet
You say, "Love," and it sounds so good
You say, "Love," and it sounds so sweet
