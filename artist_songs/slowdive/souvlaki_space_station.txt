Closed doors brings open minds
See you smile inside
Faces, and I've fallen
Wonder why I'm here now

In asylum, don't you see?
In asylum, don't you see?

Doors close and feelings flow
Through my mind, I feel his
Pictures, and I've fallen
Wonder why I'm here now

Curse your soul, I don't wanna know you
And I curse your soul, I don't wanna know you
And I curse your soul, I don't wanna know you
And I curse your soul, I don't wanna know you
