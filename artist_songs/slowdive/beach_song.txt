I'm hypnotized
By the beauty of the morning light
It draws me in and draws me out
And in the breeze I feel the life
Supping gently from my skin
Silence fills my head and everything

The water gently passes by
As I sit here mesmerized
I don't feel the way it drags me down
Across the waves I see a light
Shining golden in my path
Beauty fills my eyes and everything

Calling me
The beach song sings to me
I hear it calling me

Suicide can't bring me down
Your love can't turn around
Suicide can't take me
Suicide can't bring me down
