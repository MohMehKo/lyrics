Sweet thing, I watch you
Burn so fast it scares me
Mind games don't leave me
I've come so far, don't lose me
It matters where you are

As the sun hits, she'll be waiting
With her cool things and her heaven
Hey hey, lover, you still burn me
You're a sun yeah, hey hey

Sweet thing, I watch you
You burn so fast it scares me
Mind games don't lose me
I've come so far, don't lose me
It matters where you are

As the sun hits, she'll be waiting
With her cool things and her heaven
Hey hey lover you still burn me
You're a sun yeah, hey hey

Sweet thing, I watch you, hey hey hey
Sweet thing, I watch you, hey hey hey
Sweet thing, I watch you, hey hey hey
