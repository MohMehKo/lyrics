And when the starship falls away 
I thought I saw you 
It's falling down most everywhere 
I thought I saw you bleed 

I saw the streets today 
Took it all and walked away 
I saw it all, I saw the day 
Takes it all and leaves me 
I saw the streets today 
Took it all and walked away 
I saw it all, I saw the day 
Takes it all and leaves me 

Wasting life on a misery 
I come inside, I just walk away
