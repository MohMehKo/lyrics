Take me down, oh take me through
I miss the ground, I'm so lost in you
Take me down

I hear you say, "hey don't run away"
But I close my eyes and let my feeling play
It's so wild this way

I don't feel and I could never steal
I don't love, no I just don't care
'Cause I'm a silicone lover and I'm floating on air
Oh yeah!

The wind takes my works and you don't hear a sound
It's a cold feeling when I hit the ground
But you still fly
While I just try
Clouds across my brain and I can't explain
But when I look across the sky I see no memories
No sacred years
