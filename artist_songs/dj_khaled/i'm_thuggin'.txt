[DJ Khaled:]
Yeah, DJ Khaled
Mean Mug Music
Waka Flocka 
Ace Hood
This Gon' Fuck The Streets Up
This Gon' Fuck The Clubs Up

[Chorus:]
Police kicked my door in shawty last night
I'll Be Damned If I Don't Go Out With A Fight
My Girlfriend Says She Needs Some New Shoes And A Bag
I Told Her Shut The Fuck Up And Get Off Yo Ass

I'm Thuggin' [x4]
Middle Fingers To The Cops And The Judge
Raised by the old niggas, just mean mug

God Bless A Nigga So Bitch I'm Out Here
Wear The Wrong Color You Can't Come Around Here
So Get Your Mind Right And Your Pistol Close
Hoppin' Out That Ride Into Your Place Like A Seminal
All My Niggas They Thuggin'
My Lil Cousin Got His Chopper Chrome
Any Niggas Want Problems Take Your Top Off Block The Metrodome
It'll Make A Loud Noise Sound Like It's World War
Never Break A Sweat That's What Them Killers For
I Get Money Hoe, On Some Real Shit
Deck Of Hundreds On Me
That's Just What I Deal With
Waka Thorped Out And We The Business
See Me Off To H.A.M. I Bet Your Niggas Deal Quick
Mama Pray For Me, Commit A Lot Of Sins
And It Don't Make It Better Consumin' A Lot Of Gin
Blood, Sweat And Tears I Pour My Soul Out
Smell The Flowers Bitch I Might Just Pull A Rose Out

[Chorus:]

A Young Nigga Fucking Bucking With His Treads Loose
Middle Finger All The Fans Cause I Said To
Now Where My G's At?
Now Where Them Dope Boys?
Now Where My Niggas Who Be Thuggin' On The Corner Four?
Hands In The Air, Throw Your Hood Up
Hoppin' Out That 7 Tre, Them 6's When I Pull Up
Now Where My Bad Bitches Who Keep Their Ass Phat?
I Love A Bitch Ain't Scared To Throw That Ass Back
And I Keep Them Real Niggas
Homie That's A Fact
You A SuperDuck, I'm Talkin' Aflac
My Nigga Storped Out, Thorped Out
Stupid Treads In Them
Soles With Them Stone Mouth

Club stupid packed, it's a mad house
Catch you sniffin' by yourself, and then you assed out
And homie that's word, my niggas gon' learn
See that red in blue, I'm runnin' out my Converse

[Hook]
