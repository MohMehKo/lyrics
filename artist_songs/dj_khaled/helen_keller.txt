[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Miami!
Dade County!
Lets ride!

[Verse 1: Kat Dahlia]
I’m from Miami, bitch
Yeah, that’s Miami streets
And all the haters want to push us, try to give us heat
Baby, we live in heat, so drop that shit and drop the beat
Lets party in my streets and leave the hotel room with dirty sheets
I’m no holds barred, baby, I’m gung ho
They sayin’, “Girl, you ain’t Jamaican, accents got to go”
And I say, “Hell no, hell no”
I got Jamaica in my lungs, it’s that good hydro
I got that Barbee flow, I’m feelin’ irie
Party, work and chill on the beach all day
Got Corona in my hands, got that iron in my blood
Got my toes in the sand
And my God is the Sun

[Hook:]
I’m shakin’ up the game, trying to test my luck
Living life everyday, by what comes up
Yeah, I’m working on some things
Getting my weight up
I’m Helen Keller to the hate
I’m sayin’, “What?, what?, what?”
I’m shakin’ up the game, trying to test my luck
Living life everyday, by what comes up
Yeah, I’m working on some things
Getting my weight up
I’m Helen Keller to the hate
I’m sayin’, “What?, what?, what?”
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2:]
We in that heat wave, where people ain’t phased
Workin’ to get paid
This town, they don’t play
The girlies like, “Yay”
They like the heart race
“White girl” on a white girl’s face
And I’m [?]
We do it for the trills, trills, trills
We got enough bills, bills, bills
So keep poppin’ them pills, pills, pills
I’m chillin’ in my [?]
Bring my girls to the damn party
Bro, don’t touch me, I got my own money
If you want a drink for free
Show my girls your body

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
My town likes to party all of the time, all of the time
Take me down to prime
Give me a steak, if it’s bloody that’s fine
Got a roach in my pocket, took Mary J to dine
Let me clear my throat
(Yeah, yeah)
Have mercy babe, I hope you don’t mind, mind
I’m on a fucking boat
(Yeah, yeah)
And I’m thirsty babe, pass me the champagne, pagne

[Hook]
