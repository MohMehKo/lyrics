[Nicki Minaj:]
Yo, he ain't messing with no average chick, pop, pop
He got Nicki, he know that he hit the jackpot
Every baller tryna score, check them shot clocks
But I hit 'em with them 'Bron/Iguodal blocks
Eat the cake and he suck on my toes, yes
Hitting them home runs, I'll be like "Go Mets!"
I want a dude that'll still kiss me when he mad
Type to cut me diamonds, he can miss me with them bags

Future Hendrix
I'm a do that favor, drippin' flavor in the two piece
I'm gonna keep my promise, never treat you like a groupie
Calamari dinners, got you eatin' raw sushi
Still in the trap but I like my bitches bougie
Two cups of Styrofoam, excuse me little mama
I can hold you down, be your friend and your lover
You want watches, new Versaces, you want CÃ©line
Top back, dreamin' money ain't a ting

[Rick Ross:]
Seeing two G-wagons in my driveway
Facetime, two black bottles by my fireplace
Fell out with your peoples so you took the pictures down
Instagram ain't been the same since you so distant now
Take you shopping in other places that I won't name
First time your friends really got to see Balmain
20 million cash, seen it there with my two eyes
We the best and I told you this back in '05
(Maybach Music)

Ooh, just in case you need me
