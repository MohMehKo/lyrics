[T-Pain - Chorus] 
All I Do is win win win no matter what
Got money on mind I can never get enough
Whenever me and Khaled do the remix
Everybody hands go up
(Ey, showtime)
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, 
Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air make em stay there... 

[DJ Khaled]
Sittin' on the top floor
What you think I'm hot for
Every summer drop more
Hits to make my stock go (up)
Them hands go (up)
Them fans go (up)
Number one in this bitch and I'ma (stay there)
We the best of the best
While you haters asleep
I'm yelling free weezy
I at the heart of the streets
Who hotter than me (Khaled)
I'm wearing the crown (we can't stop, won't stop)
Go hate on me now

[Rick Ross]
I can never get enough when it comes to gettin' feddy
Niggas aint ready for my Ferrari Scudliegi
Mario Andretti, money coming fast
My honeycomb hideout is made of all glass
I can never be a racist
Wake up every morning just to count white faces
Neo in the matrix, glorious as Morpheus
Employed all warriors I mean as a scorpion
Dr Kavorkian

[Busta Rhymes]
Like a hot brimstone
Yo, everytime I come we got another nigga come and get a lot of money
When I'm in the building and I promise there aint no mothafucker better better better
Ah ha, ok
Niggas know I got it when I hit ya with the pidda padder
Everybody see me then you hear a lot of chitter chatter
Know there aint nobody badder badder badder
I watch a lot of niggas when I'm in the cut, so sick
When I come hit em in the gut
You will crown me king (no matter what)
Ok lets shine my friend
Get up on my grind again, some niggas should be happy that I chose to rhyme with them, cause... 

[Chorus]

[Diddy]
Hey turn me up man, I want them to hear me
Ayo check this out, 

My heart racing like I snort cocaine
I got a billion reasons you should know my whole name
She got the most paper, Mr New York times
I'm a natural born winner Mr New York's mine
Everybody getting money but I cop the first 6
Now I run the game so I toss the first pitch
Yeah I let you wife her but she still my first bitch
Less than 9 digits nigga that ain't fucking rich muthafucker

[Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, all I do is win aint that the reason that you really mad
Undisputed hailing all the way from Trinidad
I aint mad Ma, I see you with your bummy swag
I'm in that money green Jag lot of money bags, 
I told Khaled that you the best but I'm the bestest
Better run for cover if your name is on my checklist
You can talk slick all the way down to the welfare
As the IRS bitch I'm paying for your healthcare

[Fabolous]
Look I'ma make this here official
Let me clear some issues
First off I am not for Britney Spears initials
That's no BS at your request
Lean back you and your crew Fat Joe TS
Yeah it's young funeral
Hard black on me
So act like summers over and fall back homie

Winning is all I do, I'll answer all of you
But y'all aint saying shit like prank callers do

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Yo, it's already proven I got them birds moving
All I do is win I'm allergic to losing
Yeah, yellow gold cuban, 9 mill brullian
I show you what to do with em
Finish em, I'm through with them
They gon have to jump me, this gon take a few of them
They don't want no problems
They might end up sueing them
Disassociate yourself have nothing to do with them
We already got a shyea we tryna get two of them

[Fat Joe]
Just blew trial, crack lots like is little Italy
Your wife she a screamer yelling slow down Joe you killing me
Beat her like a prize fight mommy I'm a rude boy
You just hit the powerball
Everyday a new toy, nigga it's a stick up
A muthafucking robbery
Hots that have Haitian Jack proud of me
Riding through Harlem me and Jeezy pardon me
Puffy surfin on the hood for niggas that keep doubting me

[Chorus]
