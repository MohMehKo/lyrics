[DJ Khaled:]
This We the Best Music, WTB

[Hook - Ace Hood:]
I ain't worried, I ain't worried
Every time I jump on a beat these niggas get nervose
Ho, naw, I ain't worried, just know I ain't worried
Rap game that's mine due time I ain't lyin', y'all ain't gotta be worried
Ho, naw, I ain't worried, these niggas ain't worthy
'Long as my family straight, you know homeboy I ain't worried
Ho, naw, I ain't worried, ain't worried bout 'em
Ain't worried bout 'em, naw

[Verse 1 - Ace Hood:]
The illest nigga know this, the king cat has spoken
I run the south, you run your mouth so please quit with the assumptions
Niggas in the Benzo 10-4 ridin' with the chopper clip extendo
Ain't no game, this ain't Nintendo
Blowing on the highest grade of indo
Rockin' Givenchy, Givenchy, Givenchy, hop on the beat and I catch me a body
Millionaire hundred million deposit, just so my niggas, we each can divide it
Talkin' bout money all over the table, money all over the floor
Killaz they all in the Porsche, pourin' champagne on them hoes
All my nerves best rolla, Ferrari double donuts
I ain't worried bout a damn thing, young nigga big nuts, ha!
Laugh at it all, you rap niggas out tryna sound like Hood
You can keep that flow, hope it tastes good

[Hook - Ace Hood:]
I ain't worried, I ain't worried
Every time I jump on a beat these niggas get nervose
Ho, naw, I ain't worried, just know I ain't worried
Rap game that's mine due time I ain't lyin', y'all ain't gotta be worried
Ho, naw, I ain't worried, these niggas ain't worthy
'Long as my family straight, you know homeboy I ain't worried
Ho, naw, I ain't worried, ain't worried bout 'em
Ain't worried bout 'em, naw

[Verse 2 - Rick Ross:]
First 48, aha, yeah
I'm a threat to these niggas, it's kill or be killed
On the night he get murdered, I be somewhere in Brazil
Feds tappin' my reps, got the keys to success
My whole team gettin' rich, I know these haters feel pressured
Retaliation a must, put a bag on it, nigga
All day he on twitter, straight ride on that nigga
I'm Mr. drivin' my Bentleys, all my folks gettin' mad
Underground I'm a king, posting pictures with Ja
Swisher sweets in my luggage, Belaire in my bucket
Niggas know where I be, we straight mobbin' like Duddy's
Ace gon' be my nigga, I make him clap through your window
Better watch how you talkin', this SK be a blender

[Hook - Ace Hood:]
I ain't worried, I ain't worried
Every time I jump on a beat these niggas get nervose
Ho, naw, I ain't worried, just know I ain't worried
Rap game that's mine due time I ain't lyin', y'all ain't gotta be worried
Ho, naw, I ain't worried, these niggas ain't worthy
'Long as my family straight, you know homeboy I ain't worried
Ho, naw, I ain't worried, ain't worried bout 'em
Ain't worried bout 'em, naw
