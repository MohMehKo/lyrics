[Verse 1]
[Beanie Sigel]
Yea, when I copp its 4 doors I'm to big for a coup nigga
An when I go to war I don't get shot I just shoot niggas
An I don't trust a nigga as far as I can throw em
Even though I'm feeling strong enough I prolly can roof niggas
Yea, Ya boy back in the booth nigga
I'm off the weed but I'm back on my juice nigga
I beat the case so its off with the suits 
Back to Fateegs, black teeâ€™s an Timbaland boots Nigga
The year is new, I want my spot back take 2
Matter fact take the whole click who you know can fly by in the 05-06
When they see that new V the dope boys go crazy
You know I still fuck with State P still fuck wit Dame Dash still fuck wit Jay-Z
Still real steel still recognize real I still feel it in the air 
We kill at will here

[Chorus]
[Beanie Sigel]
First Pac got got, Then Big clock stopped
Now somethin going on wit the Roc
I'm hearin shit about a break up, the shit people make up
I'm like "Damn when will it stop?"
Jay an Dame ain't speakin, Game an 50 Cent beefin an Cease got Lil Kim knocked?
I'm hearin all this in the jail while I'm sittin in my cell
An I'm waitin on some mail from the Prop

[Verse 2]
[Jadakiss]
Yo you gotta hole in you and you bleedin
So its not like I'm just callin you "Pussy" for no reason
Me? I'm a bastard I hit the blunts till I gotta cough then I pass em
Exhaust on the Ashton, that next choice you make might be ya last one
Shit that I needed stuck with me from the classroom
Real talk now, who's the King of New York now?
Boys got safe in the house, I gotta vault now
From my old grams still, wit my old fam still
Still gettin wireless head that's with no hands
Listen My grandma in compensation compares to yalls is way beyond exist-ions
D-Block daddy new black Caddi comin through knockin Micheal McDonald and Patty
P's of haze is still goin for 8 in the Nati
Rather have God arrest me then Satan ta bag me (Get Serious!)
I'll gladly involve ya moms, Al-Quada Jada I'm only involved with bombs (Uh)
Put my life on it
soon as you put in the hot water all you gotta do is put the ice on it
I been givin to niggas for years I'm responsible for niggas careers Muthafucka!

[Chorus]
[Beanie Sigel]
First Pac got got, Then Big clock stopped
Now somethin going on wit the Roc
I'm hearin shit about a break up, the shit people make up
I'm like "Damn when will it stop?"
Jay an Dame ain't speakin, Game an 50 Cent beefin an Cease got Lil Kim knocked?
I'm hearin all this in the jail while I'm sittin in my cell
An I'm waitin on some mail from the Prop

[Verse 3]
[Beanie Sigel]
Hold ya head up Cass don't stress wait a come on fast
Keep to yaself just try not ta come off ass
Cause these niggas ain't playin fair
You know stay on ya square, handle ya biz be the man you say you is
