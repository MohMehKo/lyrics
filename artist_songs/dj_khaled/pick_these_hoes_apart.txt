[Kodak Black:]
Ain't tryna flatter you but baby you a star
I'm a come after you, I seen you from afar
When she walked in I was standin' by the bar
Soon I saw you girl my dick was standin' hard
She so wet I make that pussy fall
Pussy good, I just might buy you a new car
Girl you could come and meet my mom tomorrow
The way you walk I thought you was a model
I'm just a regular nigga from the bottom
I hope you ain't one of them hoes that like to gossip
First I eat it then I beat it just like Michael
Yeah, I write but I consider myself an idol
Ain't wanna say it but I think I like you
Certain shit I just gon' do because I'm prideful
Let a nigga get a little close to you then inside you
It's okay bae don't be scared I ain't gon' bite you

[Jeezy:]
Love 'em with your mind and never with your heart
Yeah, I'm shinin', don't you see me from afar?
We the type of niggas pull up in the cars
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart
She can't wait to fuck a nigga in your squad
Real niggas wet your head and they shinin' hard
Rolex today that Audemar tomorrow
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart

One thing about that sack boy, I'm a run it up
Your favorite trapper's favorite trapper and you the runner up
Free credit, say one bitch, you know I got that sauce
Really Gotti here, he ain't got it, I'm a motherfuckin' boss
Cause I call when I call I ain't tryna catch no feelin's
Dick rock hard, yeah I hit her with the buildin'
To all my haters I be mad too, you gotta watch this
Pull up in them 'Raris by the twos just like they toxic
And it ain't about the sprint lil nigga, it's about the marathon
One time for my city bitch, they love me like I'm Farrakhan
Woke up on the first, yeah I bought a couple bricks
Got 'em all off then gotta suite up at the Ritz

Love 'em with your mind and never with your heart
Yeah, I'm shinin', don't you see me from afar?
We the type of niggas pull up in the cars
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart
She can't wait to fuck a nigga in your squad
Real niggas wet your head and they shinin' hard
Rolex today that Audemar tomorrow
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart

[French Montana:]
Shawty cause of you
Went and dropped the roof
Went and got the loot
Went and hit the dealer
Went and dropped the deuce
Tried to make her mine
I'm a hustler lookin' for a buster
Baby go and find 'em
See you on your Oprah gram
We can hustle, both can shine
She buy the payment I knew that
My mind's telling me don't do that
My dick hard so I flew that
That fake love, we grew that
Take her for that mac and let me see the real
Pussy off that mansion I can see your grill
Fuck the blogs, baby chill
I pick these hoes apart
Fuckin' with her mind so much it started fuckin' with her heart
And I just play my part
I'm just seein' if you real, you wasn't with me from the start
These hoes'll tear your heart apart
