A bitch can get the business

Just know my niggas squeeze on side
The only problem is we doin' this head knock
I told Ross, we gon' show 'em how the gutta do

Slide in the slider, in and out night vision
Scopes on the AR to hit 'em with precision
And did I mention this one here's
For the thugs dummy? A little drugs bunny

Blood money and I'ma count it till they come for me
The feds hate it, they mistakin' me for Blanco buddies

I'm puttin' blood, sweat and tears for this cash money
I'm talkin' crooked unidentified bags of it
I'm talkin' yellow table paper, put the tags on it
You play with mine bet I turn you into crash dummies

Sweets in the trunk, streets gimme sneers
Money comin' fast, blood comin' slow
Who dem boys with the H? Feds wanna know

Gators on thief, neighbors gon' sleep
You dealin' with a G and the haters gon' see, boss
I'm in the dealership with a duffle bag
Couple Mazaradihs, couple hundred stacks

Far from peaches and cream, niggas deceased on the scene

Make a nigga understand, we gangsters, we don't play out
Came from under the sand, lift my own weight up
Bought a house off the curb was patient, so it paid up

No pleasure and pain, homie, just the price for the flight
Don't get'cha head chopped, fuckin' with them five stripes
Eagle land it went south now we got the cake
Paper plate money every time I hitch a state

High on this pressure life, famous from the mud
Got the game from some old heads, I took it up in blood

A mill on some whips, a hundred on ya life
