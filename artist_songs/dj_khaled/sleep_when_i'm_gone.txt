[Intro: DJ Khaled]
About to change the game
DJ KHALED!
WE THE BEST FOREVER
Cash Money, Young Money
I'm for real about this shit
Let's go

[Hook: Cee-Lo]
I'm countin' my time, cause my time is my money
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing
Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone (Gone)
I'm lookin' at the clock like yay yay
Naps to my treasure, yay ay
(Time's on the side, whoa)
Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone

[Verse 1: Game]
They say sleep is the cousin of death, guess we related
Cause I'm the most slept on, and the most hated
Hated, hated by niggas with no hustle
Starin' at me in the club like I won't bust you
In the face with the spades, life is a card game
And I'm playin' spades, gamblin' with y'all change
Fuckin' basketball wives, while you at away games
Really fuckin' basketball wives, ain't gotta say names
Whole body tattered like a New York City freight train
Niggas get to barkin', put a bullet in the great dane
Try me, end up like why me?
Team full of animals, like I coach the heat
Four floor mansion, close to the beach
6 car garage, that's how I'm supposed to eat
In Miami, rolling up kush on boat decks
Flaggin' down the waitress, wavin' my Rolex

[Hook:]
I'm countin' my time, cause my time is my money
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing
Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone (Gone)
I'm lookin' at the clock like yay yay
Naps to my treasure, yay ay
(Time's on the side, whoa)
Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, I don't survive the test of time doin' this shit so long
And only rest to rise again homie, I sleep when I'm gone
Look, a legend while I'm prime, and so current and they hate this
The streets classified me as another level of greatness
I don't fight for crowns at all, I let whack niggas bitch

And let 'em flip while they debate on who the king of this shit
Listen, see I don't waste time debatin' over those things
Because I'm God motherfucker, God create kings
Watch it, I'm hearin' that a lot of niggas mad through the grapevine
The piano soundin' beautiful and sad at the same time
The feelin' of a funeral, so study you niggas
Khaled, provide the theme music while I bury you niggas
See now there's no escaping the God, you better find a get away
'Fore I start wiling like Haitians and Jamaicans when it's Labor Day
Khaled, every time you know we gotta make 'em love it
And realize every thing is hotter when we touch it

[Hook:]
I'm countin' my time, cause my time is my money
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing
Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone (Gone)
I'm lookin' at the clock like yay yay
Naps to my treasure, yay ay
(Time's on the side, whoa)
Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone

[Verse 3: Game]
Ayo Khaled, let this shit breeze

It's poor lil' rich nigga, that's me
Smoke comin' out the sunroof, blowin' on hasheesh
Can't stop now, cause I'm in too deep
1.5 wide, every 2 weeks
Niggas wanna kill me, let the shells fall out
Life is short, then please, my kids gon' ball out
They kids gon' ball out, 20 years from now, pullin' cars out
You gon' think cocaine gettin' hauled out
Ass gettin' chipped in, crystal meth gettin' dipped in
All cause you let a nigga slip in
Aftermath, '05, G-Unit, '06
Everything else is gymnastics, watch the dough flip
Sittin' on the couch, smokin' up memories
Pourin' Jack Daniels, toast to my enemies
Fuck beef, nigga I ain't got the energy
Take the last shot to the dome, John Kennedy

[Hook:]
I'm countin' my time, cause my time is my money
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing
Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone (Gone)
I'm lookin' at the clock like yay yay
Naps to my treasure, yay ay
(Time's on the side, whoa)
Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
