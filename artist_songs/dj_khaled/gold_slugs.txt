When I'm licking and grillin' you know she love that

When it's over she'll need the undertaker, killed that
Your body's shakin' girl, I feel that
It's mine forever, we grind together
And when you put them slugs in, we even shine together
And I love that and I think she knows that
Whenever she all at it gotta go down

But nobody handcuffin' baby, no doubt
Cause we both know what it was
