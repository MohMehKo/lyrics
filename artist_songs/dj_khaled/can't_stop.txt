[Verse 1: Birdman]
Shinin', grindin' on the shine
Flippin' all the time
When we hustlin', Young Money gunnin'
Cash Money flippin', shit them everytime
When we grindin' cause we gettin', flippin' the change range
And doin' different thangs, hittin' the same lanes
But flippin' didn't change
Yeah, higher then we ever been
More money, now more money, cause we ballin' in

[Hook: T-Pain]
You know I can't stop, I won't stop
I feel like everybody's trying to kill me
So I don't stop, 'till I'm on top
And God keeps telling me I will be
If you with me then salute, you know what to do
You know what to do
Put your hands up in the air
You can make it through
All you gotta do is
Put your hands up in the air

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Shinin' bright lights, hotter then them other lights
The real life flash mash on the same night
More money, now we brighter then we even been
Hundred thousand poppin' bottles, bitch we goin' in
Crystal lights, blowin' on that Khaled dro
Turkey bag, hundred thou on the marble floor
Rainbow, red bone with the triple color
Hurricane, make it rain, bitch every summer

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Yeah it's on deck, straps on deck
Sticks on deck, Stunna island, private jets
Put the house on Gin, and nigga we place the bet
From hundred G's to flippin' hundred, bitch we hit the liq'
High on the hill, the view above the falls
Smashin' in the field, 100 balls [?]
You know how we do it, bossin' up grand news
Uptown survivor, money really shoot

[Hook]
