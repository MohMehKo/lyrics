Zoom high a the cloud him a float pon
First class to the world me no coach man
None in a my league
Watch out now

Them not in a my league
None in a my league
Them a hype with a little bit a money and weed
None reach no way
And I [?] them a lead
None in a my league
None in a my league
Them too slow them a invalid
Man full a step like a centipede
None in a my league

First thing give Jah thanks for the most things
Security higher me guard
Look 'pon me house and me yard
And me one dozen pit bull dog
This industry must be me girl
Cause me fucking this industry hard
No a chat and them a hype and sus
Them nah live better than dog
Me bank account gone psycho
Five hundred milli 'pon the house title
You not see your slow life is a cycle
You not see me fast ten times nitro
Me a do it like Nike
Tell them drop asleep like night
Lord Jesus Christ
Nah sell out the gully for no peas and rice

None in a my league
None in a my league
Them a hype with a little bit a money and weed
None reach no way
And I [?] them a lead
None in a my league
None in a my league
Them too slow them a invalid
Man full a step like a centipede
None in a my league

A fi mi school
A the time for devotion
Them soft like lotion
Them a make scraps we a make potion
Yes I'mma turn river in to a ocean
Zoom high a the cloud him a float pon
First class to the world me no coach man
From Town to Mobay have the most don
Buss out the kyle is a real money motion

None in a my league
None, none in a my league
Them a hype up a little bit a money and weed
None reach no way
And I [?] them a lead
None in a my league
None in a my league
Them too slow them a invalid
Man full a step like a centipede
None in a my league

Zoom high a the cloud him a float pon
First class to the world me no coach man
None in my league, watch out now

None in a my league
Them not in a my league
None in a my league
Them a hype with a little bit a money and weed
None reach no way
And I [?] them a lead
None in a my league
None in a my league
Them too slow them a invalid
Man full a step like a centipede
None in a my league
None, none in a my league
Them a hype with a little bit a money and weed
None reach no way
And I [?] them a lead
None in a my league
None in a my league
Them too slow them a invalid
Man full a step like a centipede
None in a my league
