[Intro: Future]
All these chains that I'm wearing is not ordinary
My watches and my rank is not ordinary
Shawty what's the boooo...

[DJ Khaled]
Fuckboys hate to see me winning
Kept shit 100 from the beginning
They wanna see me lose everything I got
Y'all keep hating, I'm right here on time

[Hook: Future]
They tryna blackball me, they say I get too much money
They want my name from me because they know what it do
They say I'm A-Rod
Nigga, cause I got the juice
They tryna blackball me, went and bought a Ghost as a coupe
Soon as I ordered it, they put it right on the boat
These bitches hungry, they tryna take me to court
They tryna blackball me, I said I went to the pros
They tryna blackball me, I keep a gang of them hoes

[Verse 1: Plies]
I'm tryna fuck these fat ass hoes by the end of this month
Ain't drivin my Rolls Royce no mo, I see the fuck nigga once
I heard some niggas downtown tried to jail me up
I heard they tell the feds every day to pick me up
But I'm like damn my nigga
What I did to you?
And I'm like yea my nigga
What you want me to do?
Want me to burn yo pussy ass out and knock you off?
Want me to go on yo baby mama house and kick in her door?
Guess what? Some 36 a nigga, they'll be here tomorrow
Don't know what the fuck they doin
I'm gonna go buy some tomorrow
My homie pulled me to the side and told me tell me the truth
She say she heard em fuckin up sister I say she'll fuck me and you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Say where you getting money? That shit bring plenty haters
Just cop that Phantom coupe, I list a Grammy later
White crib a couple acres, she fin that Gucci nigga,
They tryin to count me out, but bitch I'm back like Schwarzenegger
They tryina blackball me, don't wanna see me win
And after fuckin hittin it like that he go again
They say I'm underrated, I'm just misunderstood,
They can't compare to me, I wish, I wish you would,
I'm screaming fuck the world and everything in it
My homie beat his case case, cause they can't find a witness,
You wanna test my G, man fuck this industry
I strap shit 4 door your matches, for all those who sleeping on me,

[Hook]

[Bridge: Future]
All these chains that I'm wearing is not ordinary
My watches and my rank is not ordinary
Shawty what's the boooo...
