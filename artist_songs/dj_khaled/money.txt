[Young Jeezy]
I can’t even walk
My pockets too heavy
Got that 40 on me now
Them choppers too heavy
Told ‘em you gotta fall back
I can’t sneak you in the club
Said I’m in the car you need me my nigga
Nothin’ but love
Last blunt [?] so much smoke I can’t see ya
Ain't over here, look I wouldn’t wanna be ya
Talking so many bitches we got bitches on bitches
Way she moving that ass I think the bitch got switches
Pull up to this bitch Escalade full of killers
Now only thing realer: Escalade full of scrilla
Louis V to the back, half a rack for the snap back
Wiz Khalifa’s on the coupe I’m talking black and yellow flapjacks

[Young Jeezy - Hook]
When I talk I be talking ’bout money
So please don’t talk to me if you ain’t talking ’bout money
Weed, coke, ecstasy, nah we talkin bout money
Don’t know what went wrong with me, cause I be talkin bout money
We talkin’ bout money

Let the money talk (money)
Let the money talk (money)
Let the money talk (money)
Let the money talk (money)
Let the money talk (money)
Let the money talk (money)

[Ludacris]
LUDA!
I’m talkin’ ’bout money you never seen, hoe
The incredible hulk, so much paper I’m turning green, hoe
Green giant, I want it, I buy it
Y’all just ballers on a budget
Your money’s on a diet
And I’m laughing you such a riot
David verse your Goliath
Let my money talk for me
Hear ‘em, be quiet
Hamilton said “was happenin’?”
Jackson said “wat it do?”
Grant chucked up a deuce
My Benjamin said “fuck you”
Ahhhhh
It cost money to fund a war nigga
I’ll have you laying right on the floor nigga
And take you higher
I’m a lover not a fighter
But if a rappers gettin gassed
Than I’m the first one to light her

[DJ Khaled]
More money, more problems
So bring the problems

This We The Best Music Group
YMCMB
Bitch I don't see you
Get your money right
Hustle Hard
I’m forreal about this shit
Get money!
