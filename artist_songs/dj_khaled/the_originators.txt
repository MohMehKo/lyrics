I Told Em Ima Get Up Get Out N Get Something 
But I Was A Little Bitty Nothin  In the City Thuggin 
Never Been A Nigga  Thats Never DoneLess Than 100% 
The Hustles Thats In Me My Thug Mentality
Showed Me What To Do To Improve My Salary 
Dont Nobody Move Or You Could Be A Casualty
Why You Would Really Wanna Cross Paths With Me 
One Nigga Left And They Thought We Was Done
Done Think You'll Get Rid Of The Twist Of The Tongue 
They Thought We Was Finished But We Just Beginning 
They Want Me Commited For The Murder 1
No Where To Run No Where To Hide Competition Ready To Die 
Opposition Never Survive When I Get Done Busting My Rhyme 
Ima Criminal Transformed To A Lyrical Bad Storm 
Did I Mention My Fast Flowing Lately Its Got My Cash Growin 
And Ass Showin These Niggas Cant See Bone They Already Know 
Came Down With A Style Unfamiliar Sound Thats How We Kicked In The Doooor 
What It Be Like Bone Thug Nigga Born And Bred In The Cleveland Street Life 
And Believe We Aint Goin Nowhere We Permanent Posted Up Like Street Lights 
We Do It Still Get To It Undisputed Who Would Of Knew It 
We Stay The Truest Suited And Booted

In the hood where its good yea we get respect
On any street man its time to bill collect
Its a promise little homie  no need for threats 
We da best in the business we breed the next
Nigga ride with a thug on a cleveland quest
We really aint mad at you clones
You gotta give credit where credit is due
Why wouldnt they give it to bone
If you ever gave props den a massive thanks
Now you thinkin how a master thanks
