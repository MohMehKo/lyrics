Wi nuh in a nothing wid you
If you naw show no progress
Man fi go through life without no stress
Be friends meet some people that's hopeless
Cause dem a nuh, no progress

Dem chat a bag a things and dem screw
A just suh dem come tan
A stone you bread come from
A jail bunk dem waan see man head pon
A you nice life dem waan see you dead from

Dem cyaa trick mi and kill mi
Mi cyaa dead
Dem a send a bag a news to you woman
Fi you woman left
Life is like the weather
You haffi go through the season
People change and you don't know the reason

Duppy bat nuh have no direction
And a dem a try lead you
Mi couldn't work wid a nigga
From him a work wid him evil
Mama seh good mix wid allot of evil
The devil in allot of people
From mi naw feel you energy mi gone
Like the good bible mi ready you

Dem cyaa trick mi and kill mi
Mi cyaa dead
Dem a send a bag a news to you woman
Fi you woman left
Life is like the weather
You haffi go through the season
People change and you don't know the reason

Nuh bother drown in your sorrows
You fi feel like swim
Is a real life thing
Yes today you down
Now you feel like king
The life where yo fam wasn't inviting
Sometimes mi know it stressing
Mi waan every youth rise and count unuh blessings
Dem waan si wi feed pon dumpling and mackerel
Sea food and lobster pon the hot grill
Wa happen to dem

Dem cyaa trick mi and kill mi
Mi cyaa dead
Dem a send a bag a news to you woman
Fi you woman left
Life is like the weather
You haffi go through the season
People change and you don't know the reason

Wi nuh in a nothing wid you
If you naw show no progress
Man fi go through life without no stress
Be friends meet some people that's hopeless
Cause dem a nuh, no progress

Dem chat a bag a things and dem screw
A just suh dem come tan
A stone you bread come from
A jail bunk dem waan see man head pon
A you nice life dem waan see you dead from
