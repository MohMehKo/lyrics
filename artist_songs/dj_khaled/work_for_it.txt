You gon' have me flying in and out of town
You said you've been losing weight and dropping pounds
Damn, I think I'm 'bout to leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
I had you after twelve but you came right after at two
I could have anything I want but I still want you, that's the truth
I'm not really into the sentimentals
Just me and you behind the tinted windows
While you throwing all these innuendos
We just finna' fuck up all the incidentals at the SLS
That's LA confidential, show me everything that you've been through
We only do what we meant to like, woah
This that, titties on the glass, pull the curtains shit
This that, fuck you in the air, no service dick
This that, call his ass right now, say you're deserting him
This that, call him while we fucking so he heard the shit

Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, you ain't got to church though
I still bless you but you what come first though
Make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, that's what they pray to church for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for

That bitch is jockin' me, and young niggas admire me
Yeah, but I'm a product of the streets so they won't hire me

Can't let you play me off the streets you know I got kids
And more major keys than a locksmith

My ride was a bus named MARTA
Pillow full of Estee Lauder
Nigga, I'm allergic to a charger
Left the foreign cars in my garage, ah
