[Bryson Tiller (DJ Khaled):]
Ayy everybody switchin' up, I guess
(DJ Khaled)

[Bryson Tiller:]
It's just the way it is, oh
These niggas beat me to it
Yeah, these niggas started changin', oh no
They changin', they changin'
And everything I got they wanna take it, oh
My money and my lady, no
They wanna separate it
They try and tear us down
They tryna tear us down
Hey, hey, hey

[Future (Bryson Tiller):]
I'm touchin' triple digits, now it's catch up, oh
I'm touchin' M's and my life is pandemonium
I got a re-up for you, you know I invented those
Everything around me trickle like sauce
You niggas old news like a five star
Every single night I got a bad bitch
See her comin' up, she came with another bad one
I done caught 'em vibin' the wave, double jeopardy
They know I'm the king of these melodies
You know I was in the bando, smellin' like a half a key
You can smell the molly comin' off me when you next to me
Put it in my cup and let me medicate
And it all started off with foreplay
(With foreplay)
Cappuccino vodkas in Santa Monica
(Santa Monica)
We was best friends until the fall out
Now I got the lawyers goin' all out

[Bryson Tiller:]
It's just the way it is, oh
(Just the way it is)
These niggas beat me to it
Yeah, these niggas started changin', oh no
(They changin', they changin')
And everything I got they wanna take it, oh
My money and my lady, no
They wanna separate it
They try and tear us down
They tryna tear us down
Hey, hey, hey

[Bryson Tiller (DJ Khaled):]
Hey, I been reaping those rewards
From my hard work, I'm startin' to see the jealousy
Hey, they talkin' shit, that's what they tellin' me
What? They write it to somebody else instead of me
Okay, hey, I got my dollas, my cash up
They wanna see me on my last one, last one
They tell you things you don't wanna hear
They don't wanna see me with a bad one
No, or see you in a Benz wagon
With your new bag on
The bag that these hatin' bitches only spend a hundred plus tax on
The one we spent five racks on
And I love to get on tracks that I can rap and spit facts on
I'm the one that niggas love to turn they backs on
Yeah, that's cool with me, that's cool with me
(Another one)

[Bryson Tiller:]
It's just the way it is, oh
(Just the way it is)
These niggas beat me to it
Yeah, these niggas started changin', oh no
(They changin', they changin')
And everything I got they wanna take it, oh
My money and my lady, no
They wanna separate it
They try and tear us down
They tryna tear us down
Hey, hey, hey

[Bryson Tiller & Future:]
It's alright, yeah
I'll be alright, yeah
As long as you right here, yeah
I'll be just fine, yeah
(I'll be just fine)
Just fine, yeah
Just fine, yeah
We was best friends until the fall out
Just fine, yeah
We was best friends until the fall out
Just fine, yeah
Now I got the lawyers goin' all out
Hey, hey, hey

[DJ Khaled:]
They jealous, they want us to fold. That will never happen. They want us broke, so you know what we gonna do? We gonna become billionaires. From now on when you see me, call me Billy. I'm a be alright, I'm a be just fine.

[Bryson Tiller:]
It's just the way it is, oh

These niggas beat me to it
