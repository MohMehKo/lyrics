[Hook: Future]
Let's get it started, let's go dumb and retarded
Let's get high as we wanna, let's go and burn up a forest
Better load up the cartridge, get the car it's inside it
Let's put some ice on your watches and designer on your body
Let's order bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's order bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's get it started

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I'm turned up till my knob broke say turn down I say nah ho
My neck rocky like Balboa, my watch official, it's uncalled for
In the same regions on all floors, I got six sluts on all fours
They french kiss and say bonjour I got my own shine but I want yours
I'm stupid rich got stupid bitches, who stupid thick in Louboutin
Don't like me, fuck you again, wanna fight me well come do it then
Right hand to God on everything I see the hearts of men and they bear lame
I won't entertain no punk shit, they talk shit and I run shit
Boy you tryin' to get what I been here, headed down for like 10 years
I'm gettin' it in til it's unreal, let's say one album, like ten mill
Plus my swag is stupid low IQ (gone) hurt nigga feelin', I don't try to
But when you ballin' like I do, you know something nigga, don't like you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
It's Tunechi, you bitch you, I like sticky weed and sticky pussy
Sittin' on like a hundred mil, I treat that shit like whoopie cushion
Ballin' on them fuck niggas, they on the bench I bench press em'
They hating, from the sidelines, they pissed off, piss test em'
Man I'm on that lean, liquor for the bitches
Whom fuckin' with me? all I hear is crickets
I got stank up in my swisher, my bitch pussy smell like roses
She on that Molly, I'm on that Mary, I'm on that Mary like Joseph
Man I'm married to this shit, you can call it Shit Carter
Dick stay up like it got insomnia
All them niggas hatin, fuck ya in ya pussy
The best things in life are free, free my nigga Boosie, gone
