No wheat or white bread in my Pilsbury dough
Just give me the right head with the letters G-O
All eyes if you like your momma, lame as a video
Imagine you and other kitties(?) strollin all over the city

Pull strings like a violin
Then I cross over like I'm Iverson
To Z100 out to Ireland
White chicks is standin on line
Black chicks is standin on line
Don't discriminate, I disintegrate
So much cake, maybe we can get away

[CHORUS:]

You feelin luck in the street
Girl tell me, what's on your mind, let me know
Girl give me the go, give me the go ahead
What's on your mind, let me know
