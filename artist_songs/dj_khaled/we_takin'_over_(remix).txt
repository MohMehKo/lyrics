All shined up ready to glow
Drop that top, ready to roll
Up in the club, ready to hoe
Gimme that mic, and I'm ready to flow

Fuck champagne, ready for patron

The highs and the lows, how ever you wanna feel
You want that night out, I got that Niquil
You want that matrix, you choose the right pill
Fuck you think I do the shit for my health
Same cause in the week, I ain't seen my wealth
On the low, I keep the bankroll like fresh
cocktail dress by John Calliano
In the restaurant owned by Italians
I'm a boss bitch my last name should be Soprano
Switching up the phones so the boys can't follow
They tryna lead me to the old address
I left the "no 2" and they been back since
I'm in a new state, a new place
With new plates, shit damn near a new face
So by the time they tryna build them a new case
I'm gone like yesterday
What! What!

[[Chorus (Akon, R. Kelly ad-libs)]

[Young Jeezy:]
Look, I am the streets
Real nigga's sittin' that's word I meet you
She like my wrist so she follow the rainbow
Now I'm switchin' lanes she tryna follow the lambo
Can't keep up best follow Range Rov'
But be cool 'cause my goons in there
And a couple of guns, and a couple of clips
And a couple of K's, and a couple of bricks
And then I throwing in the partner what the fuck that cook like
Mark Jacobs solo what the fuck I look like
Hey, this the remix ain't it
Just got the new 'rari and I just might paint it
Just got the new plane and I just might fly it
Just left Lennix Mall and I just might buy it
Stay strap nigga don't even try it
Pockets so fat I need a go on a diet, haha!
