[Intro: DJ Khaled & Akon]
DJ Khaled
Konvict music
Cash Money Young Money
Let's go

[Akon: Bridge]
You already know the score, been down this road before
Gotta hold your breath gotta take it now
If you want a taste of my life
Nothing good comes easy
Gotta go hard believe me
Gotta risk it all
Gotta roll the dice
If you want a taste of my life

[Chorus: Akon & B.o.B]
My life my life
My life my life
My life my life
My life my life
My life my life
My life my life
If you want a taste of my life

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah they wanna taste that rapper life
But the road to fame usually spoils the appetite
We live the type of dreams you wish for in the afterlife
But all that they can see is velvet ropes and flashing lights
Not everything is lavish life but in the mirror all I see is all the nights I had to fight
It's so ironic all I had to sacrifice but now I got the money I get everything for half the price, damn

[Verse 2: Akon]
You know Khaled everybody wants the good life
Nobody really wanna pay the price
No pain no gain na na na na
This might take a little longer
No pain no gain na na na na
It'll only make you stronger

[Bridge: Akon]
You already know the score, been down this road before
Gotta hold your breath gotta take it now
If you want a taste of my life
Nothing good comes easy
Gotta go hard believe me
Gotta risk it all
Gotta roll the dice
If you want a taste of my life

[Chorus: Akon]
My life my life
My life my life
My life my life
If you want a taste of my life

[Verse 3: Akon]
They all wanna make it up to the top
Khaled they don't wanna give up everything they got
No pain no gain na na na na
This might take a little longer
No pain no gain na na na na
It'll only take you stronger

[Bridge: Akon]
You already know the score, been down this road before
Gotta hold your breath gotta take it now
If you want a taste of my life
Nothing good comes easy
Gotta go hard believe me
Gotta risk it all
Gotta roll the dice
If you want a taste of my life

[Extended chorus: Akon]
My life my life
My life my life
My life my life
If you want a taste of my life
My life my life
My life my life
My life my life
If you want a taste of my life
