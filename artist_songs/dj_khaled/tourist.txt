[Travis Scott:]
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist
Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest
How does it feel, my nigga? Damn it feel great
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist

I might bust that little bitch, pass to my buddy
Bust that bitch and pass her to my buddy
How does it feel, my nigga? Damn it feel great
Bust a little bitch and pass her to my buddy

Gin and tonic, pass that to my buddies
On that lean and soda, I'm not no alcoholic
How does that feel, my nigga? I said it feel great
Come bust a trip and come and be my tourist (straight up!)
Alligator swap, we pill pop in my hood
Ain't no changin' that, cause that check we on good (straight up!)
9 A.M. clockin', 4 A.M. water whippin'
Just got to the Mo, my niggas still leanin', tippin'
Had to bust a bitch I knew back from my old days
Shawty held me down when a nigga had that bald fade (straight up!)
504, my nigga, shout my woadie
La Flame killin' you niggas, damn, I'm sorry
That's not my kid, call up my nigga Maury
Drinkin', drivin', but I wore a condom and I'm stickin' to that story
I bust a nut like I bust a brick
Bust a band like I bust a bitch
Bust a nigga like I bust a bitch
But I pass it like I'm Robert Horry (straight up!)

Bust a trip, come and be my tourist
Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest
How does it feel, my nigga?
Damn, it feel great
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist
Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest
How does it feel, my nigga?
Damn, it feel great
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist (straight up!)

[Lil Wayne:]
Wayne's world, part time, excellent
She might be a tourist and terrorist
A Hell's Angel actin' like she heaven sent, Lord
We can go sight seein' and all that
She can be wifey and all that
She's the tourist, I'm her tour guide
Can't see this bullshit, I hit bullseye
The weed got her lightheaded, red eyes
I told her, "Don't worry, we stay high"
Plus there's a bed on my tour bus
So you can get fucked as we pull out, Lord
I pull out like skrrt in New Orleans
I pull up her skirt and get gnarly
She come to Wayne's world just to party
And all of my tourists is foreign

[Travis Scott:]
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist
Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest
How does it feel, my nigga?
Damn, it feel great (straight up!)
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist (straight up!)
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist
Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest
How does it feel, my nigga?
Damn, it feel great
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist (straight up!)

[Lil Wayne:]
Khaled, fuck with your boy
Bust a trip and come and be my tourist
Moolah!
God is great
We winnin'
Amen
Hallelujah, Hollygrove
Hallelujah, Hollygrove
I'm gone
Bust a trip and come and be my tourist
