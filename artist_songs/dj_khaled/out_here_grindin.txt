DJ Khaled,
We the best season
Has returned
I do this
For the streets
The runners

Cause I'm out here grindin'
Cause I'm out here grindin'
Hey Hey
I don't care what nobody say
Ima be me (be me)
Stay hood
Stay rasied in the streets
(cause I'm out here grindin')
niggas talk about greatness
Whenever they speak about me
(Cause I'm out here grindin')
I ain't splitting
Nothing with nobody homie
I gotta get me me
(cause I'm out here grindin')
I ain't slept in 8 days
I can go for 8 weeks
Ain't nothing to me
Cause I am the streets.

[Rick Ross:]
Ricky Ross
Put my life on the line
But I'm likely to rhyme
I'm on top of the game
If you like it or not
Ask how I get freesh
Strawberry swishy sweets
You'll be dealing with H
When you dealing with G's
Flashing deal
With the realest
Shopping like
It's still december
Diplomat on the fender
Of the phantom
I'm the winner
I do it for the hood
I do it cause you're gay
You suckers
Wish you could Ricky Ross
Is in the bank

[Plies:]
Hey, feds

Before price go up
Came in the world thuggin
Leaving with big nuts

Ain't scared to go

Stay rasied in the streets

(Cause I'm out here grindin')
I ain't splitting
Nothing with nobody homie
I gotta get me me.
(cause I'm out here grindin')

I can go for 8 weeks
Ain't nothing to me

Of my environment

A diabetic and all
All I want is my paper
I don't care what they say
They stick their tounge out
When they bow their head
(Cause we da best)

You niggas soft

Dark boys on the black gas

[Ace Hood:]
Hey knock knock

The Bank's door
Gimme the million dollars
And I'm dropping off
The cash flow
See you ain't heard

Now my money right
Spend it on the u-haul
Dippin' on the turn pipe
Call up my dogs
Brag up my face
Bodies gon fall
Tell em it's ace
If I catch a charge
I'm gon flee the state
My nigga's
LA Reid and Khaled
Watch me beat the case
