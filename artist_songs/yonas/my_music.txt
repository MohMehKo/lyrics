So tell me why I ain't, on top
And y'all know 'til I get there, I won't stop
And even when I get there, it don't stop
Workin' on this music, my music
Me and my music
Just me and my music
Just me and my music

Let me just explain to you what I feel deep inside
Music's not a hustle, it's the reason I'm alive
I'm from a good home, but my life ain't coincide
So before I wrote these verses I faced 10 to 25
Inspiration's something that I hope, I can give y'all
Cause music's something that I learned, I can live for
So when you're hustlin' know I'm hustlin' with y'all
That's why I made "I Am Us" cause yo I really is y'all (huh)
I made it out my depressive state
All of a sudden life turned around and served me blessings on my plate
So I really fuckin mean it when I say I'm feelin' great
And it isn't just a statement, fake statements I just don't make
Cause music's my religion, the legend has been written
That's word to John Lennon, Bob Marley and a vision
You see the boy swag every time I walk around
Cause I'm feeling like I'm walking with the crown

For those of you just joining us, welcome to what I do
I never lie, anything you hear from me is true
For those you of you who've been here for a minute, or 2
I'd like to thank you for supporting every single verse I drew
Now everywhere I go they know my music shit is real
Maserati and a Mill, all these labels know the deal
I'm that young mutha fucka with the radio flow
But I don't fuck with nothing on the radio though
Don't mind me I'm cursing sweetheart I'm fine as these verses
And all them dudes that be hatin' never remind me in person
So I rhyme with a purpose, and I may not be a pastor
But half these pastors are robbing their people blind in their churches
So as far as religion it's hard for me to pick a side
I'd rather hit the dealership and pick me up a ride
I'm all about my girl, with nothing on the side
And as far as the bottom, this is good bye, so tell me why [?]
