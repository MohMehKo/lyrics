Ladies on the block, homies bring their rides out
Sneakers not in stock, they just sold your size out
I'm good up in the north, on occasion I fly south
To shut down the club, and party like it's my house
I love what I see, and everything I feel
I make sure to focus on everything that's real
Feeling like there's nothing that the summer can't heal
Holding on to every moment cause the winter's on it's heels
Sitting here thinking, fall got me tripping
School's in session, but I think I'll skip it
Thoughts of the summer makes life worth living
May the beautiful sins of the season be forgiven
Hopefully I'll make it, to see another summer
To see a girl count cash nails full of colors
To see kids let loose on the fire hydrants
And tourists hit the city wide eyed, and silent
Cause it's summer time...

Summer time, I've come to find
Brings the best times in my life
Summer time, I've come to find
Brings the best times of my life

Hey there pretty lady, let me buy you a drink
I swear this shit was written like life supplied you with ink
The kind of love we have, it's not required to think
And it's gone in a second, I don't advise you to blink
Summer time madness, the best you can have shit
You can add and divide but you'll find it ain't average
Chilling with my crew, bar hopping with a passion
Toast to success watch the air fill with glasses
We tryna reach the masses
Cigarettes burn leave our worries in the ashes
Had the best teachers, want to thank y'all for the classes
Thank you to the haters for the kisses on our asses
Close your eyes and imagine
Beautiful memories dress my mind, no fashion
Forget the past, I'm passed it
I'm just tryna find more sun to bask in
It's the summer time...

Ayo I know this is a hit cause everybody's tellin' me
I'm the engine in the hood feel the energy
I know this is a hit cause everybody's tellin' me
I'm the engine in the hood feel the energy
