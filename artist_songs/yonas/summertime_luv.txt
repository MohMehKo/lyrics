As still as the world all goes
As still as your heart is beating
I just wanna know
What you're feeling right now
Cause I can see in you
What you see in me
And I don't need the season to change at all
There's something in the air
I feel it everywhere
And I don't want to leave this moment behind
There's something in the air
I feel it everywhere
And I don't want to leave this moment behind

So take my hand
And I'll show you the way to my world
Summer love I ain't even gotta know your name
I know you feel the same
So take my hand
And I'll show you the way to my world
Summer love I ain't even gotta know your name
I know you feel the same
Summertime love

As still as the world all goes
As still as your heart is beating
I just wanna know
What you're feeling right now
Cause I can see in you
What you see in me
I don't need the season to change at all
There's something in the air
I feel it everywhere
And I don't want to leave this moment behind
There's something in the air
I feel it everywhere
And I don't want to leave this moment behind

So take my hand
And I'll show you the way to my world
Summer love I ain't even gotta know your name
I know you feel the same
So take my hand
And I'll show you the way to my world
Summer love I ain't even gotta know your name
I know you feel the same
Summertime love

I know what you're thinking girl, we just met
Funny how you can take my breath away
I always want more, never want less
Let me explain how I feel
I get it girl we just met
Funny how you can take my breath away
And I don't want this to end tonight

So take my hand
And I'll show you the way to my world
Summer love I ain't even gotta know your name
I know you feel the same
So take my hand
And I'll show you the way to my world
Summer love I ain't even gotta know your name
I know you feel the same
Summertime love
Summertime love
Summertime love
Summertime love
Summertime love
