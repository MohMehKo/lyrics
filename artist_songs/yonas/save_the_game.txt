Welcome out to the new movement! Haha
Your boy Cause!
City of dreams baby, put that work in and that work out!
Yo

Here's the bottom line, I'm made to change the game
And though I'm independent I'm still a major pain
Looking at the in-crowd smudging out my name
I know it's cause I'm special like I colour out the frame
Jigger niggas only figure what's up when they grudge it
Realer niggas write what jigger niggas can't fuck with
Shout's goes out to Nas, shout's go out to Marley
(Trying to save the game)
Even if it stops me
I was always told I could be what I desire
I wanna be the reason that these rappers all retire
Too many chefs in a kitchen start a fire
So a couple chefs that worked for me just got fired
The problem is I'm becoming a real man
These other niggas around me becoming some real fans
So I had to make a couple edits to my team
(Trying to save the game)
Now I'm living the dream, Yeah

I'm trying to save the game (I'mma save the game)
I'm trying to save the game (I'mma save the game, whah)
I'm trying to save the game (I'mma save the game)
I'm trying to save the game (Oh yeah, I'mma save the game)

Yo
Ayo, God always told me to write what's on my mind
I think that Ginny's happy that they extra light in shine?
No-one in my city can mess with the way I rhyme
And billboard awards for all the songs I design
My cartel is vicious like I dominate your tourno?
Other rappers don't really deliver they just yawn-oh
So the highest bid gets awarded to my name
(Trying to save the game)
Minus all the fame
Mr Obama, I was really 'bout to thank ya
Then you went and hired a crew of investment bankers
Just when things seemed cool and gravy
A cloud blocked the sun and made the situation shady
Life is just a movie and I bet you at the end
Everything around us will become a fucking trend
So before it goes down I got no-one to blame
(Trying to save the game)
That's word to my name

I'm trying to save the game (I'mma save the game)
I'm trying to save the game (I'mma save the game, whah)
I'm trying to save the game (I'mma save the game, yeah baby, haha)
I'm trying to save the game (Yo, I'mma save the game, whah)

Whatup Y'all
Welcome out to the I Am Us project, haha
It's all original music
Changing the face of mixtape albums
Y'all know, haha
