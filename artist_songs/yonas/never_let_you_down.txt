The English Architect
It's your boy Yonas, nigga

Ayo
I rap like I might never see tomorrow
That's why I got a flow
That these rappers could never borrow
That's why I'm that person
People ain't afraid to follow
Cuz I sharpen my plan
To cut through verses like Avocados
You think you fly
Cuz you rock a Rolex with Bravo?
I'm steady scoopin' up
David Yurman diamonds and Movados
All the ladies in the valley know my steez
Rockin' ski goggles, no skis
This is simply who I be

[Hook:]
Everyday, the pressure is on me
What I'm goin' through and who I'm gonna be
I'm trying to give God a reason to believe
I could never let you down
I could never let you down
[x2]

Holy Moses, my flow could divide the oceans
That's why I reach the emotions
Of people who's eyes is open
But also people who's eyes is closed
Cuz they broken
That's why when I finish verses
They say: "the wisest has spoken"
I see the devil would rather throw me a stone
Than throw a bone
It's always lonely in spite a throne
I see the labels'd rather throw me they cash
Than invest the time and energy needed to make it last
Huh
I take they money, run with it
You can check my bank account just to see that I done digits
But when life gets kinda stressful I don't rely on my stack
I rely on the very people who always have my back
Let's go

[Hook]

(I could never let you down)
(I could never let you down)
[x4]

(I could never let you down)
(I could never let you down)
