She turn the lights down
And I turn the music up
Cause this is the night it all goes down
Cause she's got the lifestyle
You read in a magazine
You turn the page and it's hard to put it (down)...

Aw shit, here I go
And you ain't gotta tell me yeah I know
I'm fresh from my head down to my toes
And my eyes are the window to my soul
Take a look, take a look, most people wouldn't dare
Flying at a height that you wouldn't even clear
Shutting' down shows, and I'm coming up with flows
That if I didn't come up with them, then you probably wouldn't hear
I'm the definition of innovative (puff that)
That's the definition of feeling faded (pass that)
What's the definition of being cool?
Well that's the definition of being you... damn
Poured up champagne drink from the bottle
Cheers to tonight, can't think about tomorrow
Paid in full and I'm running up the tab
As I pour my life in the glass...

She turn the lights down
And I turn the music up
Cause this is the night it all goes down
Cause she's got the lifestyle
You read in a magazine
You turn the page and it's hard to put it down
Down, she put it down, down
She put it down, down
It's hard to, it's hard to put it down
Down, she put it down, down
She put it down, down
It's hard to, it's hard to put it down

Lookin' all good, damn girl
And everybody say it's a mans world
But how could that be when there's women like you
But I ain't tryna get deep, just dance girl
Confetti in the air and the lights are low
Champagne spillin' on my nikes
And she back it up hard but I like it though
Her and I go together quite nicely
I'm a do the right thing like Spike Lee
But I'm a Bronx boy, uptown swag
You ain't even know what the fuck y'all had
When you stumbled on me, it's like I snuck right past
And now we're seconds from history
I capture the essence of mystery
But at the same time, I reveal it all
I guess that's how it is when you hit it off

[Hook]

I ain't tryna get deep just dance girl
I ain't tryna get deep just dance girl
Dance girl, dance girl, dance girl, dance girl
I ain't tryna get deep just dance girl
I ain't tryna get deep just dance girl
Dance girl, dance girl, d-d-d-d-d-dance girl

[Hook]
