I know what I'm supposed to be
How you tryin' tell me what I'm supposed to be
I know what I'm supposed to feel
Yeah I know, Yeah I know what I'm supposed to feel
But I don't know, I don't know how
I don't know how to say this an another way

When a world goes crazy it happen at an alarming rate
Just look what happened at DC army base
And where I'm walking is a path and it's hard to trace
But I got my mom's humility and my father's grace
So pick a rap I bet you none are better
My flow so sick it's forever Under the weather
Just look into my eyes you'll see I'm searching for better
Cause my niggers still walking with weapons Under they sweather's damn
The underground beginners and just say goodbye to me
Guess it's cause they see I'm become such a commodity
But I know the truth these cameras can never lie to me
So count on me to be Superior superioritcally uh

And it's crazy man what more can I give
Cause what I already gave is water under the bridge
And if everybody dies but not everybody lives
And I'm tryin' see this world for what it is

[Hook]

Yeah, your boy goes in, my flows chosen
And we don't live forever, enjoy the moment
Ya all frozen but I never slow down
Cause I gotta represent for my hometown
N dot, Y dot, where K dot can never be
That king dot I am like a gun to that slingshot
Puttin' out a gimmicky that you think's hot
That ain't no definitive line that's an ink blot
Me I got that score phazy vision when I see a scene
I saw my dreams made it happen and now I'm seeing green
And on the way I saw some people that saw themselves playing
And rolling, I'm playing so we really couldn't be a team

And it's crazy man what more can I give
Cause what I already gave is water under the bridge
And if everybody dies but not everybody lives
And I'm tryin' see this world for what it is

[Hook x2]

(Cause I gotta represent for my hometown)
