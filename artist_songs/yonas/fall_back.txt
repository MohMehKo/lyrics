[Hook:]
Can someone please explain how I lost the game
Cause I feel alive, but I know that I ain't
And, and deep inside I just ain't the same
I'm starting to see that no one else feels how I'm feeling
I'm Broken
I swear I love you all, and I just wanna tell you before I fall
Can you hear me? I'm broken
I swear I love you all, and I just wanna tell you before I fall
Can you hear me? I'm broken

Hey yo I'm broken as they come
You feel like life begun, I feel it's over and done
They make they money rain, I pray for drizzles and crumbs
They occupy a palace while I'm living in the slums
But I'm a be the one that's laughing one day
Ain't nobody else is rapping this way
Don't nobody see my views but I don't care so that's okay
Hand to hand, oh yes I pray no ambulance takes me away
I've been bad way before Eminem and Jay-Z laid hands on Renegade
I'm just being honest, no lambo no doors roll up
Just me and my niggas on the corner with a little bit of liquor poured in our cup
Ha! We reach the game, we might not reach the fame
But we got stories so I'm sayin...

[Hook]

I swear they so so clever
They want us walkin around like we know no better
So our biggest worry is a Polo sweater
Until we fall asleep next to that cold cold shepherd
But I'm a be the one to wake us all up
I know y'all been waiting on us
I know y'all debated my flow cause I've got one the haters can't touch
I feel like my tank is on E, this damn ship is sinking on me
But I've got people banking on me
So I fight through what they cannot see
I'm just being honest, no lambo no doors go up
Just me and my niggas on the corner with a little bit of liquor poured in our cup
Ha! We reach the game, we might not reach the fame
But we got stories so I'm sayin...
