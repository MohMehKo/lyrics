Life will never be the same
And there will never be a change
There's something in the sky we all try to describe
But there will never be a name

I ain't talking about a shower from above
When I tell you I'm prepared for the reign
So metaphorically speaking, this will be around forever
Cause there will never be a drain

My flood for a flow will remain
Even when I lose everything that I've gained
If God is the music and the devil is the fame
I'm a rebel in the making cause I'm leveling the plane

Trying to unlock from the pressure and the pain
But the devil getting clever with the chains
I knew what I was before I entered in the game
I'm just trying to understand what I became

See, I was told
You can't knock me down
So please understand me now, now
See, I was told
You can't knock me down
So please understand me now, now

Yo
Last name: fail
First name: never
Can't think of any first and last name better
This kind of cold needs a coating of the truth
And could never be covered with a cashmere sweater

So you take the high life
I'll take the low one
Cause I like to take the path taken by no one
I'm becoming something that you could never imagine
You thought you had it all, but you were lacking the passion

See, I was told
You can't knock me down
So please understand me now, now
See, I was told
You can't knock me down
So please understand me now, now
