You goin' against us is your shame
No talent in it, ya'll herbs is all lame
Nothin' more raw, I'm purer than cocaine
And I don't just drive, I swerve in my own lane

Someone get a vehicle big enough for the flock
I'm sharp and I promise to steer this shit for the block
Feel you got ammo, here then take a shot
I'm the black Jack Bauer, I'm fearless of the clock

Mind over matter, it's scientifically proven
That me and music sorta like Common & Rick Ruben
Better yet, the most miseducated Fugee
Since Wyclef and Lauren I'm leaving the world groovin'

Are ya'll ready for this new shit?
Cause they talk but they don't ever do shit
I'm sick of gangs talkin' all that red and blue shit
It's time for a unified movement

[Chorus:]
It's a new world order, the city of dreams
We movin' on in, it's a new regime

It's a new world order
You know what we mean, you ain't gotta be scared
Just get down with the team

It's a new world order
You know that you like it, so why would you fake it
Get back to the basics

It's a new world order

While ya'll struggle to put out free albums
I sold my first joint and did about 3 thousand
Representin' the middle class and still drownin
'Cause I don't get government checks and free housing

I do more, but I get less than others
I'm the freshest and I don't need a freshman cover
So troublesome, could never be trouble-less
So I aim at double X, double barrel, double vest

The next best sending an alert to the press, yes
What I write gets more attention than death threats
The best bet, I could double what you invest
That's word to the exec that's signing my next check (VMG)

So are ya'll ready for this new shit?
'Cause they talk but they don't ever do shit
I'm sick of gangs talkin' all that red and blue shit
It's time for a unified movement

[Chorus]

Okay, okay yep I'm a be the star now
I'm a man not a boy I don't fall out
I can't share no such thing as our crown (what?)
Above par I could never let the bar down

Treatin' every city like it's our town
We don't just take it for the night, shit is ours now
Everyone in rap is a beast or a so-called animal
Well, I'm a burn the barn down

So are ya'll ready for this new shit?
Cause they talk but they don't ever do shit
I'm sick of gangs talkin' all that red and blue shit
It's time for a unified movement

[Chorus]

North Carolina what up?
New York what up?
LA what up?
Miami what up?

I told ya'll we was making history man
It's a new world order
Give ya'll a chance to duck
'Cause we out here
