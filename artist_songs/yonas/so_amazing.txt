Yeah... wooh!
Alright (so amazing)
So amazing (uh)
I may not be here for long, so I gotta do my work...

No more hate man we've gotta show love
Many people died cause they never got enough
It only hurts you if you're holding on a grudge
My flow so high, no wonder I've got a buzz
Hello mr. governor, fuck what you've heard
There's nothing more wrong than corruption of words
So I'm a use mine from the city to the burbs
And bring together people let the unity emerge
Press replay and I'll never be gone
Cause I will live forever, forever through these songs
"They'll never get along" is what they sing along
"Cause they read the Qur'an" and I'm reading through my psalms
They've never been so wrong, I've never been so right
But they manage to make right, look something like a wrong
Yes what I'm saying is it shouldn't be phasing
No matter who you are, you can always be amazing... damn

So amazing
It's how I feel when I wake up in the morning like
So amazing
It's how I feel when I wake up in the morning like
So amazing
Every day when I wake up in the morning I'm
So amazing
It's how I feel when I wake up in the morning like

Love thyself and you'll never be alone
Always be original and never be a clone
Look into the mirror and say, say so long
Kick and push and skate skate along
You can make strength out of every single weakness
Never mix money with the people that you eat with
What I'm saying to you all is not a secret
But this deep shit's just the dialogue I speak with
The time is coming are you ready? cause I'm ready to go
Listening to my music you better ready your soul
Taking shots at the throne, better grip and reload
Cause I ain't trippin' I'm grown
Don't be a victim to the chrome
I fly like a bee, and sting like a butterfly
What am I? better than these other guys
And so are you, so here's what you do
Never, squander your vision, envision and see it through
You're so amazing...

So amazing
It's how I feel when I wake up in the morning like
So amazing
It's how I feel when I wake up in the morning like
So amazing
Every day when I wake up in the morning I'm
So amazing
It's how I feel when I wake up in the morning like
