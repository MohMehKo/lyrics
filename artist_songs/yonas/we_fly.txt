Ayo, it's deeper than the Everglades
Welcome to the Heavyweight
I chop through these verses my lyrics are like machete blades
So go on, celebrate, I'm speaking what they never say
The tough is coming out of New York, this is Mark Messier
Lights, camera, action, let me get my cue on
I'm three albums deep, I'm bout to get my [?] on
I'm just doing me, what type of stress is you on?
I'm bout to blow up and I ain't have to rep the Quran
This is for my team, no monetary greed
I'm trying to grow an army from a solitary seed
I'm bout to do the rap what a star does to the league
Custom made captain logo with the honorary sleeve
Sweat blood and tears
Nasty love affairs couldn't die from my past but I'm back another year
So while I'm here, I just want to make sure something's clear
We the reason that you feeling like there's something in the air

[Hook:]
My flow so vivid
Ain't no fucking gimmick
Imma show you how we live and we fly (yeah)
Flow so vivid
Ain't no fucking gimmick
Imma show you how we live and we fly (yeah)
Shoot! Ay ay ay
I show you how to shoot! Ay ay ay
I show you how to shoot! Ay ay ay
I show you how to shoot for the sky cuz the shit is so vivid we fly

Yo I'm anti politician and pro rebel
But I balance my position, I'm so level
I ain't stop for an instant, I'm so settled
On this Flintstone grind, I'm driving with no pedals
I'm on that Jesus tip, bare feet to the ground
Shouts to all the lazy kings that fall asleep with their crown
Shouts to all the fallen leaders that be keeping us down
When it counts, they LeBron us and they flee from their towns
Breathe with me
Life keep playing these minor keys for me
Got a million begging hands stretched, trying to reach for me
Got these haters lurking trying to take my belief from me
But my steps are chosen so thou shall retreat from me
Without a piece I still travel pretty peacefully
Middle class knowledge makes for lower class secrecy
Upper class elegance but common wealth decency
I'm trying to stay fly amongst us all, take a seat with me

[Hook]

I'm ready for my gold crown
I'm repping for my hometown
And I can't let them down no no
I thought that you already knew
[x2]

[Hook]
