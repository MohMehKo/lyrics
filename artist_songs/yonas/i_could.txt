I remember all the people, how they said I wouldn't make it
I just wanna show you that I'm here and I'm a take it
Recently I feel like I've been having revelations
All I need is God and I'm good, baby
And I just wanna show you I could
And I just wanna show you I could
'Cause you said I wouldn't make it
I just wanna show you that I could, baby...

Yo I'm lookin' through my rear view, my past is not a clear view
I've shut down my ears, and now my heart is what I hear through
I've shut down my eyes, and now my soul is what I peer through
'Cause God whispered to me, yo these struggles gon' prepare you
Prepare you, this world is feelin' something like a throne that I'm the heir to
And since the people put me there, I put the people there too
Sky's looking gray and I'm just tryna make it clear blue
And always take the path that's opposite of what my peers do
Cheers to, college graduates that had to study hard
And homeless brothers sleeping in them gutter yards
Blessed be the babies that grow up to be their mothers charms
RIP to those few that died inside their mothers arms
Life is such a trip now, 'cause I'm taking trips now
Inches from some luggage bags with custom made grips now
All because I rip down, stages with my gift now
I'm standing on the cliff where I can say good bye to "if" now

I'm not a leaser I'm an owner, I'm high but not a stoner
I guess there's something potent in my oxygen's aroma
And if you're in a daze then I can help you out ya' coma
No diploma but the art I spew belongs inside the Moma
I'm tryna make my mom proud, that's my persona
And your guns could go pow pow but I still love the corner
So shout goes out to everybody feelin' like a goner
They put us in this ocean with emotionless piranhas
I swim around the ocean tryna feel like I belong here
But something tells me I won't make it to my rockin' arm chair
I got a fear of dying young, and that's okay though
'Cause I'm a make sure to mold the game no play-dough
Life is such a trip now, 'cause I'm taking trips now
Inches from some luggage bags with custom made grips now
All because I rip down, stages with my gift now
I'm standing on the cliff where I can say good bye to "if" now

[Hook]

And I feel like giving in
I feel like falling down
But I could never stop it now
So I turn and face the crowd
