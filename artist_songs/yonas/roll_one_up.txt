[Yonas:]
Roll one up
Hold me down
Roll one up
Roll one up
Hold me down
(Yeah)
It's ya boy YONAS
Let's go

She a fly senorita, no she no diva
Woke up in adidas, fresh wife beater
Skin tan from Ibiza, no goalie but a keeper
She spend her own money when she swipe up her visa
Ohhh man
Never be lonely
Because I'm a blank movie, put your scene on me
And you ain't gotta stress, you can lean on me
We can roll one up tonight

I know that you gotta be the one
Because life without you is no fun
And just about every time you come around I'm in love
I never felt quite this way
It might be crazy of me to say
But enough though it ain't
I'm feeling like it's my birthday
So let's celebrate
Hey, I want you to know
I ain't got a care in the world baby
Roll one up and hold me down
Roll one up and hold me down
Cause I want you to know
I ain't got a care in the world baby
Roll one up and hold me down
Roll one up and hold me down

[Sammy Adams:]
I just want you rolling up in some bikinis
I swear it's simple but it's better if it's tiny
Used to get the [?] now I'm hitting milestones
Roll a fucking blunt the size of NFL pylons
Still a drop out
Key to success
Being real while you locked out
Baby I'm blessed
I remember of dreaming of private planes and all nighters
Beats ripping up your chest like a typewriter
Post up, yup, just like Shaq did
Crack another bitch, tell her roll another backward
Weed so good, got beef everyday
K-K no Kanye, but God I'm going cray
So roll another one
Roll what you want or something
Cause you know I'm not the one, but homie lemme tell you something
Now you see it in your mentions, so know this
The mother fuckers going places
Sammy and YONAS

I know that you gotta be the one
Because life without you is no fun
And just about every time you come around I'm in love
I never felt quite this way
It might be crazy of me to say
But enough though it ain't
I'm feeling like it's my birthday
So let's celebrate
Hey, I want you to know
I ain't got a care in the world baby
Roll one up and hold me down
Roll one up and hold me down
Cause I want you to know
I ain't got a care in the world baby
Roll one up and hold me down
Roll one up and hold me down

[Roscoe Dash:]
She so down they go up
On any given Sunday I drown at least once
She bound to be lunch when we on the liquor
Lick her like I get richer, the sicker and I deliver
I'm in love right now, got a guilt thing [?]
Man above right now, you the only one that I'm thinking of right now
Like you rang, you the reason for the buzz right now
Hell yeah, you my inspiration
Come impatient like a patient, her masturbation
Either way, no mistaken
Roll the weed like Jamaicans
Do all the shit we been stanking
We brand new ass spanking
It's her ass that even plays me a hook
I could write so many pages, a book
So many things that I can't overlook
Like how them jeans might be the real victim
I'm electrified like they got eel in them
Now we got issues, who gone deal with them?

I know that you gotta be the one
Because life without you is no fun
It's about every time you come around I'm in love
I never felt quite this way
It might be crazy of me to say
But enough though it ain't
I'm feeling like it's my birthday
So let's celebrate
Hey, I want you to know
I ain't got a care in the world baby
Roll one up and hold me down
Roll one up and hold me down
Cause I want you to know
I ain't got a care in the world baby
Roll one up and hold me down
Roll one up and hold me down

Roll up
Hold me down
If you call, I might not be in town
But ohhhh I'll be on another flight
Across the country, no way
I can pick up a call from any other girl like any other day
But I know that you gotta be the one
Because life without you is no fun
And just about every time you come around I'm in love
I never felt quite this way
It might be crazy of me to say
But enough though it ain't
I'm feeling like it's my birthday
So let's celebrate
Hey, I want you to know
I ain't got a care in the world baby
Roll one up and hold me down
Roll one up and hold me down
Cause I want you to know
I ain't got a care in the world baby
Roll one up and hold me down
Roll one up and hold me down
