That's why I'm leaving you

[Chorus x2:]
She's got everything that
She could ever need
Champagne sipping
Lifestyle's a fantasy
High off money and love
It just don't mean a thing
That's why I'm leaving
That's why I'm leaving you

Yo, now everybody knows
This girl is famous for her stunts
She never waits in line at the club
Cause she always gets the jump
Instead of having a soul
She relies on the soul inside her palms
Party all night, fall asleep, at breakfast wasted,
Just to wake up way past lunch
I hate what she does
But I love how she does it
Keep her around like a bad piece of a luggage,
When I say bad piece of luggage
I mean pretty piece of luggage
But it's pretty till you gottta lug it
Yeah, with the wrong girl, at the right time
I'm just gonna let the light shine
Cause yeah she's fine like Blake Lively
But I could never make her wifey, nah

[Chorus x2]

Now every man hopes to find the one chick that he loves
And the problem with me is I used to try find that chick at the club
And I never call a woman no bitch
But the situation is
That after a couple of shots I tend to speak in expletives
I'm guilty living my life
Loving all the wrong places
And I'm guilty at giving my heart to the girls that only have the right faces
And the right hips, the right waist, and the right bag, with the right bracelet
And yeah she's fine like Blake Lively
But I could never make her wifey, nah

[Chorus x2]

I never, never, never met nobody nobody like you
That ain't no compliment
That's the truth
You're nothing but a cold heart covered in gold
That's why, that's why, that's why
That's why I'm leaving you
[x2]

[Chorus x2]
