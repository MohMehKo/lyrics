When it rains
Write your name, on my window pane
I love what you do, It's so insane
I could jump from a plane
It still wouldn't feel the same
As it feels when I'm around you

And I remember, in late November
I followed the stars, and that's where I found you
And I remember
The DJ played our favorite song in the club
And that's when I told you

The night is young, take my hand
It's all good, don't be scared
You see the stars, I'll take you there
But first baby girl I need you to drop it low
The night is young, take my hand
It's all good, don't be scared
You see the stars, I'll take you there
But first I need, you right here

Yo summertime
Where you been?
Felt like the winter would never end
But its time for the pool parties and shots of tequila
Yeah, let it begin
Pretty girl want a ride, and who am I to argue?
Let her on in, I just rock the top
And tell her let her hair down, we'll be gone with the wind
Sunshine on my shades, something like a surfboard on a wave
Look at my eyes, you'll be amazed
I'm in a daze
From all the things that I've peered in the summer haze
The reflection is priceless
My eyes are focused on the prizes
Hands up, life's full of surprises with a goal
And the motto is to never be blinded, so

The night is young, take my hand
It's all good, don't be scared
You see the stars, I'll take you there
But first baby girl I need you to drop it low
The night is young, take my hand
It's all good, don't be scared
You see the stars, I'll take you there
But first I need, you right here

And I remember, in late November
I followed the stars, and that's where I found you
And I remember
The DJ played our favorite song in the club
And that's when I told you
[x2]

The night is young, take my hand
It's all good, don't be scared
You see the stars, I'll take you there
But first I need, you right here
