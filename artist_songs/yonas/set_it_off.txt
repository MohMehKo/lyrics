Woop! Yeah... for whatever you're fighting for
You know what I'm saying?

[Hook:]
I see you 'round the corner 'bout to set it off
But I don’t really care man let’s get it all
You see I got my fucking crew here with me
So if you want a problem come and get me
I see you 'round the corner 'bout to set it off
But I don’t really care man let’s get it all
And Yea I got my fucking crew here with me
So if you want a problem come and get me

We all buy the drink that they shovelling
They say the truth it’s so troubling
But I speak the truth and every time I tour my fan base they doubling
From New York out to Dublin
I'm hot boy, I'm bubbling
These CDs I'm smuggling
They try to decode my publishing
Cause they don’t really like what my ink write
My flow dirty like a sink pipe
Plus the pinky ring got the Ernest stone, when the girls see it they can't think right
Don't believe it then blink twice, I'm a wonka wonka from the thin slice
You thought process is on a runway, but my inside is inflite

So I'm throwing rocks at this glasshouse for the people that make this mousetrap
Standing at that front door but I got an army that's outbacked
Got a good mind but all about that for survival guide I rewrote that
Cuz most people say they wouldn't take a shot if they had to, but i doubt that
The Heat is over, It's cold now
The reaper coming, for these soul now
Cuz everybody 'round me got a gun
You'd be stupid as some motherfucker walking 'round without one

[Hook]

Do you buy whatever they sell ya'll?
Me and my niggas is like hell no
Could be two of us to like twelve of y'all
But we still blast the shots to shells fall
I was born for this lifetime
Aftermath my generation
And I ain’t here to just write lines
I'm here to symbolize the last revelation
Have you ever felt like, you're wrong even when your dead right
Cuz everyone else puttin' it damn right
Ends up dead, when they pull up at a red light
Like 2pac, John Kennedy, Martin Luther, malcolm x
Funny how 3 out of the were 4 killed
But it’s seems the feds ain't have found them yet

So I'm throwing rocks at this glasshouse for the people that make this mousetrap
Standing at that front door but I got an army that's outbacked
Got a good mind but all about that for survival guide I rewrote that
Cuz most people say they wouldn't take a shot if they had to, but i doubt that
The Heat is over, It's cold now
The reaper coming, for these soul now
Cuz everybody 'round me got a gun
You'd be stupid as some motherfucker walking 'round without one
