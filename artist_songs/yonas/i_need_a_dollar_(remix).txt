Yo, I got a story but it comes with a price
I just paid the rent, but that don't cover the lights
I'm from a single parent home, no single loan
I hustle for every dollar, so singles is all I've known
No such thing as a sweet ghetto
Where broken beer bottles cover sidewalks like leaf petals
So welcome to my street meadow, where angels battle with the devil on a deep level
And cops so persistent to tie us up, but even in the jail system we fly as fuck
Hope the world get's ready cause I'm rising up
I speak directly to the rebels and riders
Yeah, yo I'm living my dream, but at the same time I got a vivid little scheme
I'm walking through the dirt trying to find me a pearl
You give me a dollar I give you the world

[Aloe Blacc:]
I need a dollar, dollar
A dollar that's what I need
Well I need a dollar, dollar
A dollar that's what I need
Said I said I need dollar, dollar
A dollar that's what I need
And if I share with you my story would you share your dollar with me?

All I got to survive off is a few things
My two hands, and some shoe strings
Like the freedom bell I could make the truth ring
For a couple dollars I teach you to be a true king
I never once claimed to be a know it all, before a dollar I could help you over the wall
Take you on a trip through expensive corridors, and decorate your wall with some vintage warhol
Living life I don't like what the coffin offers, on the corner cause I never liked the corner offers
Petty hustlers causing ruckus, but we used to sell weed that had Jamaican niggas coughing off it
Yo we living the dream, but at the same time we got a vivid little scheme
I'm walking through the dirt trying to find me a pearl
You give me a dollar I give you the world, yeah

[Aloe Blacc:]
I need a dollar, dollar
A dollar that's what I need
Well I need a dollar, dollar
A dollar that's what I need
Said I said I need dollar, dollar
A dollar that's what I need
And if I share with you my story would you share your dollar with me?

And I'm aspired by spinning tires
I die hustling, never retire
While they expire I leave a legacy behind through these rhymes press play and catch a grease fire
Y'all cheap dryers, and couldn't flow heat if I had a technician get you re-wired
I'm no liar, we win races, y'all need to get the horse power in your jeeps higher
So peace prayers, hello future, I'm trying to get my team homes with the beach by us
So if music is the hustle, where the fingers playing notes on the piano I'm the key supplier
Yo we living the dream, but at the same time I got a vivid little scheme
I walking through the dirt trying to find me a pearl
You give me a dollar I give you the world, yeah

[Aloe Blacc:]
I need a dollar, dollar
A dollar that's what I need
Well I need a dollar, dollar
A dollar that's what I need
Said I said I need dollar, dollar
A dollar that's what I need
And if I share with you my story would you share your dollar with me?
