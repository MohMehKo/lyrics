Yeah
I told y'all we was coming baby.
With the lord as my witness.
It's over. COD motherfucker.

Yeah, I'm moving on the scene,
The nicest on the mic
Since Martin Luther had a dream.
Grown in America, but I am from a place
Where genocide can turn around and wipe a city clean.
Usually I stay away from sending out shots,
But my vocal box is like a fully loaded Glock.
So, when I say hit the deck, I don't mean a yacht.
I mean you should duck and you could say hello to Pac.
All I know is go, I never learned stop.
The artist playin hits and I don't need to wear a smock.
I love my whole city, I could never claim a block,
So goodbye to the bottom and hello to the top.

You can't hold me, the streets don't own me,
I'm pushing you back for the last time.
I said you can't hold me, the streets don't own me,
I'm pushing you back for the last time.
Cause I'm getting away, I'm getting away, I'm getting away while I can.
I said I'm getting away, I'm getting away, I'm getting away while I can.

I would rather break up bread than make war.
I'd rather have one real friend than fake four.
I am never satisfied with things that I achieve,
Cause the truth is I'm obsessed with the idea of getting more.
Yup, you got it. Ain't nobody doper,
My mom was from Uganda but my dad was Ethiopian.
So what I'm hoping is to inspire the rebels,
And be loved by the ladies, you can see their hearts opening.
I'm feeling like the score is in my favor,
I got the juice, now what calls is the flavor.
When I make it, don't call me a savior,
Call me the indie artist that can ball with the majors.

You can't hold me, the streets don't own me,
I'm pushing you back for the last time.
I said you can't hold me, the streets don't own me,
I'm pushing you back for the last time.
Cause I'm getting away, I'm getting away, I'm getting away while I can.
I said I'm getting away, I'm getting away, I'm getting away while I can.

{Yeah}
This is for my Ethiopian brothers,
This is for my Ugandan rebels.
The world is in trouble right now,
It's calling on us to make a change.
