You know I said it's true,
I can feel the love, can you feel it too?
I can feel it, ah ah
I can feel it, ah ah

I feel the love, I'm really feelin' the love,
I'm your girl's favorite rapper, that poster she's pinnin' up,
I'm from a city where people are givin' up,
Cause' the government is crooked, they really don't give a fuck,
They say I'm crazy for recording these thoughts,
But every 3 quarters earned, I see the quarter that's lost,
The missin' piece to the pie, and it's making me resent,
The very genre of music that I'm helping reinvent,
The flow is so cement,
Rappers couldn't make a dent,
I'll make your fanbase put they opinions up and on the fence,
I've been a main event,
Since I could barely pay the rent,
And now they cover me in gold to listen with such intent,
You never say this shit I forever say,
I do more in 24 hours then you do in 7 days,
If you know me then you know I'm never phased,
Either show a nigga love, or we can go our separate ways...

You know I said it's true,
I can feel the love, can you feel it too?
I can feel it, ah ah
I can feel it, ah ah

I feel the love, I'm really feelin' the love,
Not that fake shit, but more like the type you feel in your blood,
Just listen to this tape, you can tell it's gonna make a buzz,
Cause' my life is like a movie and this is the making of,
Last year they said that I was underrated,
That was before the first "Transition" had been created,
And I gave you all a picture before the picture was painted,
Now you talk about me like you might be witnessing the greatest,
I don't blame you, my style is kinda unique,
The one these unoriginal rappers be tryna' repeat,
And real estate agents with properties wanna lease,
When they find out that I'm toppin' my numbers like every week,
So please forgive my momentary arrogance,
Surrounded by girls like Monroe comma Marilyn,
We're tryna' find balance in this world, it's kinda challenging,
The second "Transition" carefully this shit is happenin'...
