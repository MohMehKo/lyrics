Uh, yeah
I told you that I'mma get it
Without the wedding ring
I told you that I'm committed to the game
It's Y-O-N-A-S, you know the name
They try to keep me down but just look at what I became
And I, I told them all I'm a sign of something that's cautionary
Cause all these rappers can get bodied, this is my mortuary
So welcome into my closet, I've got some skeletons
Deeper than a mind that Walter Mitty was dwelling in
But, I never parted ways with my imagination, I just evolved
This album is like the maturation
No exaggeration, rap is over saturation
Still I hit the stage, and if you love it all you got to do is:

[Hook:]
(Tell me)
Don't keep it on the low, girl. You gotta
(Tell me)
Don't keep it quiet, girl. You just gotta
(Tell me)
I understand, I understand
You ain't got to have a plan, all you got to do, girl, is
(Tell me)
Don't keep it on the low, girl. You gotta
(Tell me)
Don't keep it quiet, girl. You just got to
(Tell me)
I understand, I understand
You ain't got to have a plan
I'm going to make sure everything is all right

Uh, ah baby
I know you wan' run cause these other dudes too serious
And that shit ain't no fun
We can hit the pedal bike and ride into the sun
It's the matrix, I'm your Ne-Yo
Baby, I could be the one
Lights, camera, action
This could be a staring role
It's the perfect scene, we ain't got to play the part to know
Live for today and tomorrow, I suppose
We can talk about the future, let's just see how far it goes
But, I never parted ways with my imagination, I just evolved
This album is like the maturation
No exaggeration, rap is over saturation
Still I hit the stage, and if you love it all you got to do is:

[Hook]

Here we go, let the wind just blow
I can give it all, if you want to take it
Set your teams in the summer breeze
Baby, you and me
If you want to make it

[Hook]
