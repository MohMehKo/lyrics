One Sec, I'll be back
I feel like I'm being trapped
Way too many girls in the Summer, Summer
And once more (Ooh!) it's on
Slow motion on the dance floor
I'm probably drunk but I love her, love her!

...So many women in the world
But I'm focused on the baddest one in the buildin'
Put it down, put it down, she put it down
Cause she love how I give her that feelin'
Baby girl this is not a hobby
I'm not a fan of the Paparazzi
But when a label asks,
I tell 'em "I'm worth a million dollars and a mother fuckin' Maserati." (Whoop!)
I've been away, but I'm back to party
Rum and Coke, call it black Bacardi
Got a love for the Piff I'm sorry
I'm Jimi Hendrix with a mix of Marley
I rock, Lamaur and Dauley
Claw money shades, in a black Denali
So let's go down where the lights stay bright
And girls get left, if they don't get it right like...

One Sec, I'll be back
I feel like I'm being trapped
Way too many girls in the Summer, Summer
And once more (Ooh!) it's on
Slow motion on the dance floor
I'm probably drunk but I love her, love her, Yeah!

...Yo!
Push to the Max. I could never do the minimum
Give me any game and I bet you I'll be winnin' 'em
Swimmin' in women with their own condominiums
That's why they call me a "Bad Boy."
And you're bad girl, like damn girl
Shit, how the hell you get up in my damn world
But, you're lookin' like a star and I'm a fan girl
And I ain't sayin' that to get up in your pants girl, but, Ha!
You got a rockin' body
Rum and coke call it black Bacardi
6 a.m. no hotel lobby
It's after hours so let's after party
I've got a love for the piff I'm sorry
I'm Jimi Hendrix with a mix of Marley
Let's go down where the lights stay bright
And girls get left if they don't get it right, like...

One Sec, I'll be back
I feel like I'm being trapped
Way too many girls in the Summer, Summer
And once more (Ooh!) it's on
Slow motion on the dance floor
I'm probably drunk but I love her, love her

Aye girl, show me what you got! (Aye!)
Aye girl, show me what you're workin' with! (Aye!)
Aye girl, let me see you drop! (Aye!)
Aye girl, show me what you're workin' with! (Aye!)

All these girls around me
I'll let you drown me
If you let me swim in your soul
I'll stop when, I feel like I'm locked in
Then I've gotta let you go. And I'll say

One Sec, I'll be back
I feel like I'm being trapped
Way too many girls in the Summer, Summer
And once more (Ooh!) it's on
Slow motion on the dance floor
I'm probably drunk but I love her, love her!
