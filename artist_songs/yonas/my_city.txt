I just hope I'm ready when my time comes up
Cause in my hood it's crazy when the sun goes down
The party always stops when the killer goes
Bump, everyone around us quick to hit the ground
And I just wanna put up for my city
Put up for my city shine for my city bright lights, big city
And I just wanna put up for my city
Put up for my city shine for my city bright lights, big city man

Yo ladies and gentlemen let me introduce you to the fliest
And most clever dude to ever do what I do
I'm fusing the music
Better get yourself down with my crew
Cause I was just getting warmed up over the years
Now bout to get into my groove
Like hi, my name is YONAS
Damn nigga, I'm focused you shouldn't be nervous
Those just my soldiers I'm bout to be the coldest
I don't care if y'all noticed cause double X L will X out your music
Unless you meet their quotas
And all these beautiful women out there saying they loving my songs
All the homies out there always telling me to be strong
Every time I speak the truth
They sayin' they loving my facts
So why the hell would I ever take it back

[Hook]

Uh yo lately its been stop and go
That's when you should lock your door
Cause that's when we just lose control
And then run up in your house like drop to the floor
I'm talking to the hip-hop, pop country, Indy and rock and roll
I say the shit that they afraid to say
That's why every day they try to lock my soul
But better luck next time
Cause I'm in my prime
And you better not doubt it
And I got the soul
And bros in the hood still living with the power outage
All these dudes in the rap game talking shit
Well then, nigga how about it
I'm about to eliminate you
Cause the motherfucking game is over, crowded
I'm a genius when it comes to carving my dreams through the scenery
But the FCC wanna censor me
Like they don't know what this means to me
But I'm ill till the day I'm gone till the day I'm gone
You shall not mourn cause my heart lives on

[Hook]
