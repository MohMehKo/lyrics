This is one of those stupid ass flows
That will leave you dumbed down but everybody knows
This is one of those mindless rhymes
That no one understands but they sing it all the, time
This is that retarded rap, so dumb it's smart in fact
Get it? woah
I don't care if you with' it, you with' it
Either way you're fuckin' with the realest, goon

Dear lord forgive me for what I do
All I wanted was to lead people to you
But now it seems even if
I was Colonel Mustard in the library with a spoon
I still couldn't feed people a clue
Got damn why am I so fresh?
This is futuristic flow homie I'm so next
Shit, I'm known to drop a bomb baby I'm so Flex
I'm so Kobe I ain't met a proper iso yet... ha
So you could guard up if you got it
But I'm warning you, you're looking in the eyes of a prophet
Elijah Muhammad, or better yet Muhammad Ali in his prime
My stamina is non of a novice, nigga I am a promise
I've been tryna tell you dummies
Stuffy nose, I don't smell you dummies
Numbed out, I don't feel you dummies
I will kill you dummy, and when I get
The throne you will never steal it from me 'cause

This is one of those stupid ass flows
That will leave you dumbed down but everybody knows
This is one of those mindless rhymes
That no one understands but they sing it all the, time
This is that retarded rap, so dumb it's smart in fact
Get it? woah
I don't care if you with' it, you with' it
Either way you're fuckin' with the realest, goon

Usually I'm a positive inspiration
But lately I've been feeling this negative instigation
So I figured I'd sever that situation
By being the coldest, feel me shredding your insulation
Our downfall will come from within the nation
But the government don't like that I'm spreading this information
And I won't stop 'til my radio syndication's
International and I cause massive evacuations
So someone please call 9-1-1
Look at what this young fly boy done done
All the girls puttin' up their pony tails and buns
'Cause I'm looking for a Queen and they wanna be, won
I'm just so retarded nigga
'Cause the wisest man knows he ain't the smartest nigga
Nor the hardest nigga, so regardless nigga
You should keep your mouth shut or be target nigga

This is one of those stupid ass flows
That will leave you dumbed down but everybody knows
This is one of those mindless rhymes
That no one understands but they sing it all the, time
This is that retarded rap, so dumb it's smart in fact
Get it? woah
I don't care if you with' it, you with' it
Either way you're fuckin' with the realest, goon
