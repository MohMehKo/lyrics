If I die young, bury me Satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river
At dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
[x2]
If I die young

Oh my God, what's this crazy life of mine
Swear these niggas tryna kill me but I know that I'll be fine
If you send me to the dark, get this world a light to shine
Cause there's gon be a lot of people mad
If I die young
And my momma raised two kids all on her own
I was jealous of them kids who had two parents in they home
My paps left me for the sky, my pap left me for they sky
Now I'm steady poppin bottles like there's messages inside them
Uh, I'm just livin low key
Something sorta like an OG
Now everybody seems to know me
Started way back in 03
When I started to rap and smoke weed
2Pac, S.N double O.P
J.A.Y and hyphen to the Z
They taught me to write what I see
New York taught me to be real
Out here it's gonna get killed
So I gotta make that change
And just, just tell them how I feel
And I feelin like I lived so many lifetimes already
And the funny part is, man, I just begun
So if I die young

If I die young, bury me Satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river
At dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
[x2]
If I die young

Let me get a chance to say the things I never say
Cause where I'm from we lose somebody every single day
And the mothers see the funerals of sons before they sons turn 21 I swear I wonder why the heck I even pray
I take that back, I know y'all brilliant
I shot this down, but it's God in my lyrics
First they wanna sign me, then they wanna confine me, oh wait, oh yeah, I get it
Kill my visible but never my spirit
Just be careful when you burn them bridges
Once this burnin can't return it's how you learn and not been givin
God damn, hear my sound
I goes in, but I don't back down
I'm that king, but I don't rock crowns
Oh wait, yep, I do, ok
Yep no sympathy no way
That's just not how I was raised
Id rather get down a slay
Everybody that's in my way it's ok
And you can be the best and that's ok
But me being the worst that's just no way
So as long as I am livin, I'm blessed with what I'm givin, I'm good
If I die young

If I die young, bury me Satan
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river
At dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
