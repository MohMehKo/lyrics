I can tell that they love my style
In the club we always bring a crowd
Leave your girl, she might be a while
I can see you in the corner staring
Mother fucker you should take a photo

Oh, no
I'm about to go yo
Shorty drop it low to pick it up she like a yo-yo
When I'm getting so much action I should be sponsored by GoPro
(GoPro)
Back with a little more Hennessy inside of my red solo
When I'm that crazy
Man I'm back baby
Everybody in the club say this track wavy
I get stacks daily
Man these jeans don't faze me
I was about to catch a body but the DJ saved me

[Chorus:]
I can tell that they love my style
(Okay, okay)
In the club we always bring a crowd
(Okay, okay)
Leave your girl, she might be a while
(Okay, okay)
I can see in the corner staring
Mother fucker you should take a photo
(Take a photo)
I swear it'll last longer if you take a photo [x2]

Oh, no
Me ain't got no ego
But someone always taking flicks and shit where ever we go
These mother fucking cameras on me like I'm Don Cheto
Limo full of white girls, I call that shit a kilo
They A class with them B cubs
And all they carry is C-notes
That model type that make a fake nigga wanna be me amigo
So welcome out to my town
You can swim and you can get down
Shit I'm steady walking on clouds
You should take a picture right now

[Chorus]

Yeah, polo
Let me show them how to get it
I'm been gone for a minute but I'm back
With a little bit of rap
And a little more bass inside of that Cadillac that shit slaps
Like a crazy ex in the middle of the club
When she hates your guts but wants you back
Damn you wiling baby girl but shit you fine you can sit on my lap
Okay, now I'm driving with a girl in my lap
And I'm swerving, swerving all over the map
And I'm turning heads everywhere I go like Tracie Morgan in a Walmart hat
Too soon, too soon, I know
But I crashed the whip so where the golf cart at?
Because if I'm not the greatest then I'm somewhere in the ballpark

[Chorus x2]
