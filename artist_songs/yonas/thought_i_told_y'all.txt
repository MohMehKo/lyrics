I thought I told ya'll
We don't care no
We don't give a fuck what ya'll think
Ay, ay, ay, ay [x2]

Hey Mr. Politician
We don't apply a vision
We see the planet different but you don't manage to listen
My team the new entourage, no Jeremy Piven
I'm like the Fresh Prince just minus the Aunt Vivian
So the younger generation, they feeling my pain
More than they feeling the way you run your campaign
Sometime I put money over making a change
I'm just trying to make a change while making some change
The preacher trying to tell me that God is the way
As he pull up in his Bentley and parks it away
These days are getting harder and harder to stay
I take a look in my hood and they to starving to pray
I'm just thinking about the people in awful positions
Truthfully the only thing to save me was awesome musicians
So I put on, I put on for us if you understand we don't give a fuck

Truth be told I'm just trying to unify some people
Take away the ugly side and beautify some people
I hate the corporate world cause they cubicle-izing people
So I take my blessings and put music inside the people
Damn, Y O to the N A
S for me serving food for thought like penne
I'll advok a vodka splash on the rocks and I'm swaggy
So even if you boxed you couldn't knock me or jab me
I'm like, Mr. Officer I know that I'm inibriated
I'm under pressure looking for something to alleviate it
If you ever felt judged or unappreciated
Through that emotion alone we should all feel related
Shit, I'm reading through these texts and searching for protection
Then I look up into the sky and look for a connection
So I put on, I put on for us if you understand we don't give a fuck
