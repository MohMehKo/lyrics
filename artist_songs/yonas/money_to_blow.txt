[Witt Lowry:]
You told me if I paid for class, I could pay for more
Like a piece of paper, I could barely afford
Oh you got a degree? Can't afford a Ford
Be happy is free, so abort the course
Let me tell you how to keep us in chains, right keep us in chains
Paying so much that we're paying for pain
I can't even pay for a plane, we're stuck on this plane
They're leaving us with nothing to gain
Like go get a job and work for the man
And I still can't afford shit
I can barely afford chips
Sally Mae is whore bitch
And I know it's important, I know it's important
So why do I dream about money in portions, money in portions
They're making me feel like I'm less of importance, less of importance
If I don't have cash or a crib in New Orleans, crib in New Orleans
And still I wonder, what it's like to have money to blow
And spend all my cash while I travel the globe
And buying a chain that is dripping in gold
I never will let them acquire my soul
I know, what we were told was a lie
See the money don't come with the day that we die
So I focus on hoping the growth of my mind
You can buy everything but you can never buy time
It's Witt

Sometimes I wish I had that money to blow
Money to blow
So many places in the world
I never been but I wanna go
It's so unfair how we only got one life to live
Yeah
Sometimes I wish I had that money to blow
Money to blow

[YONAS:]
Yo
They tell us that we need the money
But I think that it's funny how people just fall in a trap
I say I'm one of the greatest, they say it's opinion
I say that it's one of the facts
I'm a go ham, these niggas like damn
I don't really think I wanna with that
Who am I kidding, my bank account, like a fashion show
The way it be filling with rags, filling with rags, yeah
Keep filling it up, keep filling it up
I said it before, I'm living it up
'Cause where I'm from you can get killed from above
Any day I get from here is a plus
Travel the world, am I living enough
When half the year, I live in a truck
I'm looking at my face, like I don't give a fuck

Oh yeah
'Cause this just ain't the same
I can't just take this image yeah
And put it in a frame, oh no
But this is all I know

Sometimes I wish I had that money to blow
Money to blow
So many places in the world
I never been but I wanna go
It's so unfair how we only got one life to live
Yeah
Sometimes I wish I had that money to blow
Money to blow

Sometimes I wish I had that money to blow
Money to blow
So many places in the world
I never been but I wanna go
It's so unfair how we only got one life to live
Yeah
Sometimes I wish I had that money to blow
Money to blow
