[Hook:]
If I could bury myself, I'd bury myself in music
Cause life ain't easy, life ain't easy, I'm sayin'
If I could bury myself, I'd bury myself in music
Cause life ain't easy, life ain't easy, I'm sayin'

Raise a glass, and enter through my portal
If music is my casket I'll forever be immortal
Semi disrespectful cause I'm tired of being cordial
No wait, I'm just tired of being normal
True friends & family is something that I hope to find
So I'm looking at the world through an open mind
And before I get trapped up in the maze
And go back to my old ways
I'm just wrapping you this phrase like a gift
Take it & receive it
Making music these days is easier than breathing
Every chance I get, I do it for that reason
I call it "The Proven Theory" 'cause I prove what I believe in
So much to the point, that you believe it too
These rappers say they fly well, I already flew
So I take that feeling and I give it all to you
Before I die on this earth there's nothing I'd rather do

[Hook]

In my mind, I've already died
My haters can't kill me, trust me, they've already tried
They're calling me the truth, so I can't tell a lie
And probably when I'm gone they'll whisper "he's still alive"
I'm still alive, And music is my motivation
Through my heart I've got the power to console a nation
Watch me rise to a pro without no hesitation
And don't compare me to my peers, there's no relation
And fuck you niggas that pistol whipped me at that intersection
When I see you in the flesh you're getting disrespected
I guess I'm seeing life just how I should
I always knew I could, I just wondered if I would, but I'm good

[Hook]

Looking down on life, I'm happy how I lived
Yeah I made mistakes but, everybody did
The beautiful thing about seeing through this perception
It unifies us as people and reinvents our reflection
So when we look in mirrors, we are filled with acceptance
Cause so much of our lives we are filled with rejection
It's almost like we don't, know that our imperfections are actually our perfections
I'm asking through my confessions that
We all take a little more time
Soak up in the sun, take a little more shine
Put your hands to work, develop an ill grind
And don't be scared to think, develop an ill mind (yea...)
I'm tryna get my momma out the hood
But I'm also tryna get this stupid drama out the hood (damn...)
I guess I'm seeing life just how I should
I always knew I could, I just wondered if I would, but I'm good
