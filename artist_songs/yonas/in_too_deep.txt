Straight from the boogie down Bronx
If you act stupid then you fittin' to get stomped
Hip Hop started in my borough
Now I'm bringin' it back to get it on

Livin' this life until it's gone
When you see me know you lookin at a Don
Shine so bright when I write these songs
I overshadow five cracker niggas like a bomb

Blame it on the way that I was born
Middle of the hood in a middle class home
In the middle of the streets in the middle of the beef
Where niggas hold heat with they fitted caps on

I'm a king I could never be a pawn
Hard to find like a lizard in a storm
Trust in God but I'm living in the wrong
Life is hectic but I'm living in the calm

I speak what I live and you love what I speak
Cause I'm keeping the community informed
How can there be peace in a world full of hate
Most people can't even get along

There's a difference in religion and a difference in opinion
All my people in the prison stay strong
If you're in too deep and you know how I feel
Put your pickets on the white house lawn

Hip Hop in the building
If you feel me put your hands before ya
If you know what it's like to go to jail
And be dealing with lawyers

If you feel what I'm saying
Put your hands up, it's a role call
Police and politicians
Know that they can't hold ya'll

Emcee lyrically performing miracles
Ya'll can't mimic me, please
If you roamin' with the bees then you fittin' to do get stung
That's a price cause living ain't free

Ladies show ya hands if ya all fed up
Cause ya man ain't payin for his seed
Now he lookin at the child that he made out of greed
And the nigga can't handle what he sees

You're in too deep if you wanna look fly
So you kill another nigga for his jeans
Or if you're white and you don't like blacks
So you hang a noose from a school tree

I gotta keep it real till I can't breathe
And I'm learnin' not to fear death
So much to the point I could walk through a room
Of flying bullets with a bear chest

Gotta keep it true for the dudes in orange jumpsuits
Scooped by the boys in blue
Every city that I rock every show that I do
I'm a make some noise some for you [x2]

Hip Hop in the building
If you feel me put your hands before ya
If you know what it's like to go to jail
And be dealing with lawyers

If you feel what I'm saying
Put your hands up, it's a role call
Police and politicians
Know that they can't hold ya'll

How many know what it's like
To not see the sky for a couple of years?
Thinkin' bout the issues got a nigga goin crazy
With a tissue and a bucket of tears

Bugging and I'm wild
And they lovin my style
That's why I'm the government's fear
I make music felt by your hearts and soul as soon as it touches ya ears

I'm a renegade never been afraid
To say what's going on from day to day
And I'm no teddy bear nor do I rock a scarf
Cause I'm sharp like a razor blade

And we go crazy in the hood
Instead of 9 to 5 we work that 8 to 8
And then we're hopping on a train
If I had gas money I would drive for days and days

Just so I could escape the pain
Just so I could escape the rain
I feel like everything around me
Is never ever going to change

I'll be the lightness in the dark
Protect my people from the sharks
And if you're trying to find a movement
Look no further, get it started

Hip Hop in the building
If you feel me put your hands before ya
If you know what it's like to go to jail
And be dealing with lawyers

If you feel what I'm saying
Put your hands up, it's a role call
Police and politicians
Know that they can't hold ya'll
