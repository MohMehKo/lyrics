(I've been here all the time) But you ain't know, you ain't know, you ain't know
(I've been here all the time) Let me introduce myself again
(I've been here all the time) But you ain't know, you ain't know, you ain't know
(I've been here all the time) I Thought I should have told ya'll

I've been around for a minute without the hype though
Cause people are stuck in the dark like their lights broke
The pressure's on so every song I pick the right quotes
Now I got reach in the hood as well as with white folks
And every corner there's someone hoping I might show
But I got news that they might be there forever
Like Ali in the notebook waiting on a fucking ladder
Cause when it comes to rappers it's hard to find somebody better, than me
So hold up, cause ain't nobody told us, all we know is cold cuts, cherry fruit roll ups
And now they tell and legislation simply ain't for us
But I got dynamite in my music I'm 'bout to blow up
So we'll now slow down, I'm ready for the showdown
You want it, you can get it, shit, I got enough to go 'round
Cause ain't nobody in my circle worried but the fame
We just trying to make an imprint on the game

(I've been here all the time) But you ain't know, you ain't know, you ain't know
(I've been here all the time) Let me introduce myself again
(I've been here all the time) But you ain't know, you ain't know, you ain't know
(I've been here all the time) I Thought I should have told ya'll

My new philosophy fuck the world if they knockin' me
I'm 'bout to buy preposterous properties like monopoly, and
Ain't no stopping me till the day that they properly crown me the one anomaly inside of this democracy, man
That's period no commas or apostrophies, we caught up in a cryptic politics, policies, so much hypocrisy, damn
Now I focus on hits and collaborations
Ever since The Proven Theory gave the nation revelation
Like hold up, cause ain't nobody told us, all we know is cold cuts and cherry fruit roll ups
And now they tell and legislation simply ain't for us
But I got dynamite in my music I'm 'bout to blow up
So we'll now slow down, I'm ready for the showdown
You want it, you can get it, shit, I got enough to go 'round
Cause ain't nobody in my circle worried but the fame
We just trying to make an imprint on the game

(I've been here all the time) But you ain't know, you ain't know, you ain't know
(I've been here all the time) Let me introduce myself again
(I've been here all the time) But you ain't know, you ain't know, you ain't know
(I've been here all the time) I Thought I should have told ya'll
