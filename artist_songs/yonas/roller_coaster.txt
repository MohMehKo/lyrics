It's something like a roller coaster
(Feel it slow)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook:]
Up and down, Up and down, this is how my life has gone
Something like a roller coaster
Up and down, Up and down, this is how my life has gone
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Moosh:]
Up and down, round and round, this is what you mean to me
All the time on my mind, yeah that's what it seem to be
Long as I fall in love
When I see your face, when I see your face
Sometimes I wonder why
How I gave you them butterflies
You don't want them other guys
(You don't want them other guys)
I roll up, I show you love
Hold up, you know what's up
Go up and I come back down
Something like a roller coaster

[Hook]

[Twist:]
Up and down, round and round, life is like a merry go
Here we are, what's it now
Shit, I be like there we go
Who you with, where you at, asking me like where you go
There she is, that's my girl
Shit, I be like there she go
I don't really think I'm ballin'
God damn, but you got it
I don't really think you heard me when I told you, that you got it
But I promise you can't knock me down
Hell yeah we gotta stop it now
Life with you is like a roller coaster and I think it's time we drop it now

[Hook]

Can someone explain
The S in my name
Stands for the savior
Blessing the game
Stress on the brain
From the pressure and pain
I'm just trying not get arrested again
But wait, let me spell out the story
And get it straight
Got no time for the people that tried to hate
Gotta lawyer that nigga would beat the case
No matter what you accuse or try to allegate
Cause what's the point of watching life fly by?
Got friends that hate they job
The just wanna get sky high
And honestly it feels like yesterday
That I shared the stuff with you cause you were my girl
But life is a like a roller coaster

[Hook]
