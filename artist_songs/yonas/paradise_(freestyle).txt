I'm here to save the game
I told you on my second album, man it's still the same
I got a lot of people hoping that I never change
Cause they find a little hope in all the things that I be sayin'
So welcome to my paradise, and all the things around it
I used to feel alone but now I feel like I'm surrounded
So thank you to my angels, and the man that's up above
And my only competition, that artist that wore a glove
I'm chasing legends, so I guess I'm chasing heaven
I'm placing bets and breaking odds and rollin' lucky 7's
Shit I'm celebrating life so pour a glass and have a cheers
'Til I'm gone I know my paradise is here... Yeah

These rappers claim they got a lane yo
I've got a freeway so I swerve with out no shame tho
I lost a friend aboard that suicide plane
And ever since she left for paradise my life ain't have the same glow
So fuck these rappers I swear
I'm just leaning back with my beer
I'm just trying to make it thru life
I'm just trying to tackle my fears
I'm just trying to make a few raps to show the people that someone does care
And if you need a paradise it's here
...it's here
