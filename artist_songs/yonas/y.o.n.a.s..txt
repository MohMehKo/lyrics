Okay everybody move
Cause I've been playin' 'round, but now I'm coming through
So if you ever hated on me, cool I'll be fine
Cause now you're lookin' at me like who the fuck am I?
Well bitch my name is YYYYY-O-N-A-S
Bitch my name is YYYYY-O-N-A-S flyer than a muhfucka
Yeah my name is YYYYY-O-N-A-S
Bitch my name is YYYYY-O-N-A-S flyer than a muhfucka

Is this life? is this life?
Everything that I envisioned is starting to become everything I'm living this is nice
Just my thoughts, and my mic
That's a beautiful collision, when I get to stitchin' verses, I leave earth I'm out of sight
Then I look down down from that birds eye view
And I get to brainstorming with them words I drew
And it's never just a drizzle it's a mothafuckin shower
Well equipped with thunder so you know my buzz is getting louder
Hello Mom, how're you doing? sorry I've been on the road
I'm just trying to make you proud, and let everybody know
That you raised a fuckin' star you can see it in my glow
So I'm out here gettin' money and the respect that I'm owed like...

Ayo the youth obviously need a savior I swear
And they've been sayin' it's me
Cause they can see that I care
They see the jewelry, and the gear, all the things that I wear
But they also see that I'm drama free I keep my head clear
I am the last one left, if y'all don't see that you're deaf
That means that your ears are blind
I really couldn't care less
My hand keeps jotting these notes, and my feet keep taking these steps
And my voice keeps spewing these thoughts
And these thoughts keep taking your breath
So hello Mom, how're you doing? sorry I've been on the road
I'm just trying to make you proud, and let everybody know
That you raised a fuckin' star you can see it in my glow
So I'm out here gettin' money and the respect that I'm owed like...
