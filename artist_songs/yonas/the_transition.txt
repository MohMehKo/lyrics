Yep, yep.
Dear Lord, let me back in.
I'm killing rappers.
I know that's a sin, but I can't help it.
It's in my nature.
I'm a cool motherfucker, but chill cause I got something tucked in my blazer.

Put it down. Put it down.
Put the crown on the head of the king of the underground.
No Rhianna, Kanye, or Jigga, but I run this town.
New York. New York.
Man, I love my city all around.
And I got the realest flow like I stumbled on gold.
Everybody wanna pawn it now.
Y-O-N to the A-S.
And yes I'm feeling swaggy.
Name one dude in the game with the balls.
To dare get at me.
Pull em out and I kill em all.
Trash bags in the trunk and I fill em all.
And we selling out show. And we shutting down malls.
When you need someone real who you finne call?

I'm doing my thing every single day.
How about you?
I hope y'all all see.
The pressure's on me, and I feel it more than ever.
But I still hold it down, aw yeah.
[x2]

Buy it, use it, break it, fix it, trash it if it's causing static.
Charge it, point it, zoom it, press it, snap it if it's automatic.
I'm so awesome at it.
Don't let my swagger phase ya.
I'm a cool motherfucker but chill cause I got something tucked in my blazer.

And I told y'all on my last album the theory has been proven.
Don't you feel my soul on every single track?
Like, that shit has been oozing,
Nevermind. We still here and we turn the music to a massive movement.
They gon' have to assassinate us cause that is the last solution.
What it is? What it do? What it be like?
When it come to the law, pass, two strikes cause I treat that light like green lights.
Plus, I got a little knack for the street fights.
Damn, baby girl I see you all up in my vision.
So I'd like to welcome you to the transition.

I'm doing my thing every single day.
How about you?
I hope y'all all see.
The pressure's on me, and I feel it more than ever.
But I still hold it down, aw yeah.
