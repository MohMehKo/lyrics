You gon' let me ride and I'mma let you roll
I just gotta be the one the one to let you know
I just gotta be the one the one to let you know
You f#cked up

(Yo) Girl

Even though you're crazy I'm right here with ya
Love is blurry I can't seem to paint no clear picture
Saw you driving of the cliff I still steered with ya
But everytime we crashed there was only one victim tell me how does that make sense
So I had to do my thing now that's that
Shit, you took my heart, cut it in half and gave me half back
Yeah I'mma miss some things but it's gonna be hard to replace me that's a fact
Yeah your ass is fat but you really played yourself so clap clap
Okay I can't be fake girl you know how that go
I keep the rev on my engine I keep you dead on the low
And yo the sun just keeps shining baby girl you can tell by my glow
But one thing I wanna know
One thing I wanna know

I'm trying to know (I'm tryna know)
How many miles I gotta go (Gotta go)
I travel high and low
Just so I can find my soul (Yo lord oh lord no)
Now I want every single thing I came for
And I don't understand, you should explain more
Now why you gotta go and cause me pain for oooh
Now here's what we gon' do my love

You gon' let me ride and I'mma let you roll
I just gotta be the one the one to let you know
I just gotta be the one the one to let you know
You f#cked up
You f#cked up
Girl

You gon' let me ride and I'mma let you roll
I just gotta be the one the one to let you know
I just gotta be the one the one to let you know
You f#cked up
You f#cked up
Girl

We been together since we used write our names on desks
Shit, we been together since seven minutes of heaven, yes (what a game)
Slept together while we talked about combining both our names
I confess now this whole thing is just a mess
It's so strange
It's so strange it's so strange
Tell me where does time go
I don't know I don't know
I don't know but I know
It's so strange it's so strange
Tell me where does time go
I don't know I don't know
I don't know but I know
I don't know the future but I hope it brings us back
Damn, what the hell did I just say I fell right in a trap
Cause all we ever do is tryna repeat where we at
And I think that I'm over it
I think that I'm over it

I'm trying to know (I'm tryna know)
How many miles I gotta go (Gotta go)
I travel high and low
Just so I can find my soul (Yo lord oh lord no)
Now I want every single thing I came for
And I don't understand, you should explain more
Now why you gotta go and cause me pain for oooh
Now here's what we gon' do my love

You gon' let me ride and I'mma let you roll
I just gotta be the one the one to let you know
I just gotta be the one the one to let you know
You f#cked up
You f#cked up
Girl

You gon' let me ride and I'mma let you roll
I just gotta be the one the one to let you know
I just gotta be the one the one to let you know
You f#cked up
You f#cked up
