Let the radio speak baby listen to the sound
Put your hands up if you reppin' for your town
I'm coming from New York but I'm good in every city
So go on sing along if you people ridin' with me
Let the radio speak

If the radio could speak it'd probably say that I'm the baddest
I ain't talkin' about a state I mean the atlas
Now my fans call me moonwalk Jackson
Cause I be movin' forward even when I'm walking backwards
For real, I'm just trynna chill
But I got a look that paparazzi wanna steal
So you'll never see my pen jottin' on a deal
Unless a label offers me a Maserati and a mil
For real, I'm cold as an igloo
If you ain't getting paper man what type of player is you
If you got an issue you can bet that I won't diss you
Cause these rappers play with Glocks I play with mo'fuckin' missiles
Y'all know

I'm shinin' like whoa
My timing like fast
And your timing like slow
I got a thing for ladies that show up when I play my shows
Cause I make love to them through all of their radios
Let the radio speak baby listen to the sound
Put your hands up if you reppin' for your town
I'm coming from New York but I'm good in every city
So go on sing along if you people ridin' with me
Let the radio speak baby listen to the sound
Put your hands up if you reppin' for your town
I'm coming from New York but I'm good in every city
So go on sing along if you people ridin' with me
Let the radio speak

Can y'all hear it, can y'all hear it
Yo the radio's buzzin'
Talkin' about an artist that's the smartest and y'all love him
I serve that food for thought and y'all grub it, I be buggin'
Cause my studio's a kitchen and my booth's a fuckin' oven
But there's a line, so don't get out of order
I got a couple sharpshooters crowded by the border
Now it's been a while since y'all seen a young New Yorker
Whose flow is bigger than rappin' it's more like bodies of water
Yo

I'm shinin' like whoa
My timing like fast
And your timing like slow
I got a thing for ladies that show up when I play my shows
Cause I make love to them through all of their radios
Let the radio speak baby listen to the sound
Put your hands up if you reppin' for your town
I'm coming from New York but I'm good in every city
So go on sing along if you people ridin' with me
Let the radio speak baby listen to the sound
Put your hands up if you reppin' for your town
I'm coming from New York but I'm good in every city
So go on sing along if you people ridin' with me
