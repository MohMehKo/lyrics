[Scotty James:]
I love, the look on your face
The taste of your skin, I'm caving in
Now I, could take you away
You're dreaming you say
We're gonna be okay, we're okay, and I...
Wanna be loved wanna be loved, loved by you
And I wanna be loved, wanna be loved, Loved by you
The way you slow me down, turns me around
I wanna be loved by you... I wanna be loved by you

She said her old boyfriend could never treat her like I could treat her
And I ain't one to be cocky but now I'm a believer
Her Tory Burch flats, my shell top Adidas
When I say I love her soul, I don't mean her sneakers
Betty Crocker with all the sweetness she has to cook up
She gives me butterfly effects but I ain't Ashton Kutcher
And she's so beautiful, in every single way
If you've ever been in love, you probably feel the same
Let's put our hearts in the places that really matter
And if you happen to hear this, I hope that you're feeling flattered
I'm reaching for the sky, like it's something I just does
Cause you said you needed something from above, and I, wanna be loved...

[Scotty James:]
Wanna be loved wanna be loved, loved by you
And I wanna be loved, wanna be loved, loved by you
The way you slow me down, turns me around
I wanna be loved by you... I wanna be loved by you

He never was around when she needed him there
Now she's looking broken and she needs a repair
And I am no mechanic, but I'll try to fix the damage
If he come around here hatin', I'll swing on him like a hammock
You could search Pacific, Indian, or Atlantic
And even board a spaceship and travel to other planets
And still couldn't find this loyalty, love, and honor
It's worth it, so I'd even put up with all of the drama
This type of passion isn't really for the faint of heart
When you see your life without her and it ain't the same apart
So I'm reaching for the sky, like it's something I just does
Cause you said you needed something from above
And I, wanna be loved...

[Scotty James:]
Wanna be loved wanna be loved, loved by you
And I wanna be loved, wanna be loved, loved by you
The way you slow me down, turns me around
I wanna be loved by you... I wanna be loved by you

[Scotty James:]
You've had the best of me, are you ready for the rest of me?
Show a little sympathy now...
Cause I wanna be loved, wanna be loved, loved by you
And I, I wanna be loved, wanna be loved, loved by you
The way you slow me down, turns me around
I wanna be loved by you... I wanna be loved by you
