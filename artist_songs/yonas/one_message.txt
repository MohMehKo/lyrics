I fight for hope, I fight for change
I fight so much you'd think I like the pain
I got the torch, light the flame
And with the fire I spew, I'll ignite your name
Hate where I'm headed in this life of fame
The spotlight and the sun feel quite the same
Keep me out of reach of the sniper's aim
I'm a survivor, look what I became
I guess what I'm sayin' is up in my own lane
Everybody fly but I want my own plane
Runaway thoughts can you feel my train?
All aboard all aboard, no ball and chain
Freedom in the eyes of a young black man
Tellin' my story wherever I can
As real as the blood flows rivers in my vein
I'm feelin' like the realest in the game
Go

[Hook:]
Hopefully one day I reach, high enough to find you
You see every day I'm a pray, until I find you
You look down at me and say
That I designed you
With this one message time's running out
So I just need you to go
Go, go, go, go

Pyromaniac, the way I write this
You could hate fire but you gotta like this
Cause it's known to give light to the darkness
And insert that life to the lifeless
All the parents, working night shifts
Just trynna make enough so they could buy diapers
Any second now they might flip
Cause they left all alone without a weapon to fight with
Someone please understand what I'm trynna do
And all this pent up anger I'm rhyming through
It's just me and my boys trynna find the truth
And hopefully one day you'll find it too
So while everybody else rides around in coupes
I talk to my angels when I'm in the booth
Every time I write a verse I design the youth
And God sent me as a sign so admire the the proof

[Hook]

I used to be mad, but I'm off of that
I'm a live to the fullest til my coffin black
I could talk all about how the corporate rats distort the facts
But I ain't gettin' caught in the trap
I'm just trynna get rid of the poison y'all
Over the years you've heard my voice evolve
The New Golden Era, I Am Us
Now straight to the top's where I'm hoisting y'all
I feel like the world wants to talk to me
But if I stray too far will they walk with me?
Lately I feel I dream awkwardly
Did I squander the dream that they offered me?
Shit I feel the world wants to talk to me
But if I stray too far will they walk with me?
Lately I feel I dream awkwardly
And I just wonder what the world has in store for me, unh

[Hook]
