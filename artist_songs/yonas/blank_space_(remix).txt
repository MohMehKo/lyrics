New year aw yeah no stopping the fire
Still fighting through the shit that made Hopsin retire
Most of y’all only tough when you're watching the wire
But start to perspire when your fingers on the table and I got the pliers
Shit, take him away
That’s what these uncreative labels and haters’ll say
Cause I be ripping up these flows like a paper mache
Giving out the FREEMIX for people not able to pay
But touché, I’m never falling off like a Lupe
Star player I ain’t got time for Bobby Boucher's
I am here to stay, the leader of the new age
Investors with toupees, throw money in my suit case
I don’t care what you say, if you don’t like what I say then sue meh
I’m still dropping every other Tuesday
Flyer than a blue jay. sharper than blue ray
Cooler than Cool J y’all sweeter than some kool-aid....

I got a hit list I'll write your name
With this pen re-write the game
Me and y'all just not the same
I guess I should have warned ya!

I'm gonna be forever
I'm never going down in flames
I'm hardly ever sober. Hmmm
But the high was worth the pain
You can ask anyone that knows me
They'll tell you I'm insane
Cause I've got a hit list baby, and I'll write your name...

I make hits so they’re calling me a pop figure
But truth be told I’m a Shmurda, I'm a hot nigga
I tried to tell them I’m from right up off the block with ya
And I’m just tryna stay away from all the cop triggers
So sayonara you diabolical imitations
From my inner sanctum I’m engineering this innovation
The only person to take that emotion from in the basement
And indicate that I’m ready for radio syndication
I see y’all waitin’, and thanks again for your patience
Fuck these intricate statements I’m tryna get back to basics
Counting presidents faces was never ever the basis
But I must have stumbled into a bakery cause I’m cakin’ now...

I got a hit list I'll write your name
With this pen re-write the game
Me and y'all just not the same
I should have warned you man...
I got a hit list I'll write your name
With this pen re-write the game
Me and y'all just not the same
Now I warned you so...
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't, warn ya!

I'm gonna be forever
I'm never going down in flames
I'm hardly ever sober. Hmmm
But the high was worth the pain
You can ask anyone that knows me
They'll tell you I'm insane
Cause I've got a hit list baby, and I'll write your name...
