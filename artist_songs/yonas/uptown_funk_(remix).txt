Yo, when I'm on the track I'm Mario Andretti
These rappers ain't even Mario Kart ready
I make it look light, but boy my arts heavy
Lookin in the mirror like yo I battled you already
I'm so deadly when I let the pen bleed
Allergic to ones, fives, and tens, see
Frankly, I only deal with Benji's
And now I've got the whole game in a frenzy
I'm something they probably should of prevented
Kinetic with the Phonetics and unapologetic
For this alphabetical fetish that got me cuttin' letters
Out of magazine edits, and spellin' "never forget us,"
We'll run up on your lawn with 5 black Jettas
And five matching beretta's, so please don't compel us
And anyone out there that questions the flock, if you don't believe us just watch!

Late night, I go
Uptown, I know
Every night we shut it down
If you don't believe me just watch
Late night, I go
Uptown, I know
Every night we shut it down
If you don't believe me just watch

Yo... I ain't ever have to take the SAT's
All I had to do was shake hands and say cheese
I'm here killin' shit so it's best they grieve
And there's no room for two so it's best they leave
Really what's the best if the best ain't me
And I wrote this all drunk so press play please
'Fore I start making threats to some SAE's
I don't really fuck with Ropes but I mess with Trees
I'm just kidding, sorta, Ima get out of order
So someone please get me another vodka with water
I look into my pocket and all I got is a quarter
But I swear I got you back and I put that on my supporters
I'm like wait up, hold up, Ima get out of order
So someone please get me another vodka with water
I swear I got you back and I put that on my supporters, if you don't believe me just watch!

Late night, I go
Uptown, I know
Every night we shut it down
If you don't believe me just watch
Late night, I go
Uptown, I know
Every night we shut it down
If you don't believe me just watch

Late night, I go
Uptown, I know
Every night we shut it down
If you don't believe me just watch
Late night, I go
Uptown, I know
Every night we shut it down
If you don't believe me just watch
