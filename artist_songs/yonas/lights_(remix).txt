[Ellie Goulding:]
And I'm not sleeping now, the dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping now, the strength I need to push me
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

Yo, yo this my life, this my life
Ain't no cameras, ain't no mics
And I'm coming from the dark side
But still my mind extremely bright
Call me Edison the way I'm illuminating what I write
Through my audio I help all my audiences see the light
I'm that bridge, I'm that bridge
If you think there's still a gap
Between that hardcore EDM
And this hip-hop thing called rap
I'm just trying to live my dream
They try to give me nightmares
I'm ahead of my time, hmm I would say about light-years

Try to measure my volts
Try to measure my watts
Try to measure my plan
But you'll never mess with my plot
And the courtesy's all mine, 45s and red wine
Put your chair back and recline
And unwind, it's time
Lights

Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone

Uh, yeah I shine, yeah I shine
Cause I got God in my life
But I'm feeling like a target sniper's got me right in their sight
And I lost my girlfriend, now my life is in a whirlwind
So I'm humble on the outside but I'm crumbling within
I've been feeling like these lights
Are symbolizing my fate
If I'm supposed to meet my Maker then just tell him I'm a be late
Cause I got things I wanna do on Earth
Money-wise I wanna prove my worth
Did you get the news alert?
I'm the executioner, I'm new to the Universe

Try to measure my volts
Try to measure my watts
Try to measure my plan
But you'll never mess with my plot
And the courtesy's all mine, 45s and red wine
Put your chair back and recline
