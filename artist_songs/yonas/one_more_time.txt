[Hook:]
One time for you, and, one time for me
ONE MORE TIME
Sometimes you pay but, this time it's free
ONE MORE TIME
When you hear my voice, just know it's me
ONE MORE TIME
Cause I'm the realest on the M-I-C and the realest out of N-Y-C

I got that late night, downtown city flow
The one girls get pretty too
I've got a killer instinct
So be careful when you're putting my name in them interviews
You wanna fight? we can knuckle back
But I'm from the South Bronx, good luck with that
Plus I'm 25 sittin' on a couple stacks
And I've got a gift people flip when I fuckin' rap
Yo but back to my night right?
I'm with a couple ladies, they're lookin' right, right?
Dark tints on the windows, of the limoooo
Can you picture what my life's like?
Fly mobster that's word to spaghetti bowls
But I ain't tryna tell you what you already know
But just in case you all forgot
I'm a spell it out for you one... more... time...!

[Hook]

Until me, they ain't find my market yet
I'm not a rapper I'm an english architect
Plus I got a lil niche for pickin' the ill beats
No sleep, opposite, of narcoleps...
...man my taste is absurd
Champagne spillin' with a plate of H'orderves
I hear my favorite song on the radio...
But I'm drunk so I make the up words yep...
Now I'm singin' off key
Show up to the club, they don't need ID
It's about to go down, give me 'bout three
And I'll be standing on the chairs in the VIP, yeah
Ago I'm young, I don't know rules
Will Ferrell ass nigga's so old school
And I'm about to finish what's in my cup
Somebody please fill it up
