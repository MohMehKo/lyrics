(Uh. Yeah)
Man the world needs better laws
Maybe then we’ll be better off
I’m hoping that it comes but it never does
I just wanna be the man my dad never was
(Uh)
Hear my music it’s all soul
Just got new grills and they're all gold
So I got that beef with the po-po
They don’t like my style oh no no
I don’t really give a damn I keep steering
Switch gears and the fans just keep cheering
No interceptions no interference
I’m on the A team, no Ed Sheeran
I’m headed for the stage now they’re clearing
All the bad women in the building
Damn there’s mad mad women in the building
Lets get it started tonight

This ones on me, lets go downtown tonight
(Woo)
One shot, two shots, I don’t really know if I’m counting right
(Huh)
We drink it down, so we can live it up
(Why)
Cause you never know what tomorrow brings in this crazy life
(Hey)
This life, this life, this life, this life
(Hey)
And I’m thankful, even when they say I’m crazy for living’
(Oh yeah baby. It's all I got.)
This life, this life, this life, this life
(Hey. It's all I got yo)
So lets drink to, everything that we've been through...

Ain't nobody shutting it down the way I'm killing it
And anybody talking shit actin like their innocent
Well I just wanna be the one to let you know its sentiment
I’m kissing on your girl and her lip gloss cinnamon, I love it!
You set the bar I’m above
Backing down I never does it
Plus I’m buzzing, you got one, I got a dozen
If she’s taken I hope she's got a cousin
Cause she's hotter than an Arizona landscape
Plus I bet I do the things that her man can’t
I’m a chef and that dude is a pancake
We could keep it a secret just like a hand shake
(Shit)
Life ain't free, but alright lets see
What the world brings you, with a guy like me
We could dive head first, baby I’ma OG
It’ll be all good just fly with me tonight…

This ones on me, lets go downtown tonight
(Woo)
One shot, two shots, I don’t really know if I’m counting right
(Huh)
We drink it down, so we can live it up
(Why)
Cause you never know what tomorrow brings in this crazy life
(Hey)
This life, this life, this life, this life
(Hey)
And I’m thankful, even when they say I’m crazy for living’
(Oh yeah baby. It's all I got.)
This life, this life, this life, this life
(Hey. It's all I got yo)
So lets drink to, everything that we've been through...

Girls hot and my drinks cold
Girls hot and my drinks cold
Girls hot and my drinks cold..
It’s summer time
Girls hot and my drinks cold
Girls hot and my drinks cold
Girls hot and my drinks cold..
It’s summer time

This ones on me, lets go downtown tonight
(Woo)
One shot, two shots, I don’t really know if I’m counting right
