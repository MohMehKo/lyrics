I remember how you counted me out, and you said I couldn't do it
Now I'm number one with a bullet
My head up in the clouds like I'm living in the sky
Me head up in the clouds like I'm living in the sky
I remember how you said, I ain't shit, and I'm never gonna make it
Now I'm on, I know you can't take it
My head up in the clouds like I'm living in the sky
Me head up in the clouds like I'm living in the sky

Come toast a cup with us, life is on the up and up
Tearing down stages in my ray bans... button ups
Now half the nation on a pace to come fuck with us
My rhymes are like museum exhibits you can't touch this stuff
Never got a chance to chose how my life began
But best believe I'm the author of how my life'll end
Reality is tough be careful when you pretend
And the world's forever shady be careful who you befriend
Now days seems we've lost moral value
The more promiscuous you are the more they wanna crowd you
And when you're on the ground everybody wanna doubt you
Then you hit the sky everybody claims they found you
Other rappers tell you get the dollar get the cream
I'll show you how to turn that fuckin dollar to a dream
Just park that damn bently on the side and quit your crying
Cause real humble niggas get to flyin'

I remember how you counted me out, and you said I couldn't do it
Now I'm number one with a bullet
My head up in the clouds like I'm living in the sky
Me head up in the clouds like I'm living in the sky
I remember how you said, I ain't shit, and I'm never gonna make it
Now I'm on, I know you can't take it
My head up in the clouds like I'm living in the sky
Me head up in the clouds like I'm living in the sky

This is how it be when your posse is tough
You run up in the office like you're rocky... what?
Put a fist in 'em, let em know you're spittin' venom
Let 'em know you ain't just about polos and demin
It ain't just about your, talent or your gift cause
Most people wouldn't know a pole if it hit 'em
They don't know limits, 'til they've nose dove in it
They don't know accidents until their volvo's spinning
Yellow gold, white gold, no fake gold
Rose gold, I attract attention like the rose bowl
High rides, low lows, hydrolic flows I
Design my bounce like it's bullet proof yo, hoes
Used to call me 'Y' dash next to the 'O' so
Hood for the promo, clever with the logo
But we all know that my heat makes the dough grow
So now you know, matter of fact, now you know know

I remember how you counted me out, and you said I couldn't do it
Now I'm number one with a bullet
My head up in the clouds like I'm living in the sky
Me head up in the clouds like I'm living in the sky
I remember how you said, I ain't shit, and I'm never gonna make it
Now I'm on, I know you can't take it
My head up in the clouds like I'm living in the sky
Me head up in the clouds like I'm living in the sky
