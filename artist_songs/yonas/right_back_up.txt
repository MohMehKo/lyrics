[Hook:]
I will rise from these ashes, oh
The smoke will clear, and I'll still stand there
And they won't keep me down even if I fall
No they won't keep me down cause even if I fall
I'm right back up again
So put two fingers in the sky if you feel that energy it's so alive
I get back up again
So put two fingers in the sky if you feel that energy it's so alive

Now, now this is complicated
So listen up indeed
Cause I got anything that anyone would ever need
If you could just take a break
Let me set you free
I know this life throws you things you wouldn't believe
But this is that summer time flow
Warming up your soul
In the middle of the winter I swear
And if I ever hit the ground
I won't worry about it
Cause it's not like I'll forever be there
Cause I will...

[Hook]

Ayo I'm cool but, don't offend me
Cause yeah I'm kinda crazy you can blame it on my hood
I said I'm cool but, don't offend me
Cause yea I'm kinda crazy you can blame it on my hood and...

...wake and bake
That's what most of my friends do sittin' round the house like they ain't got a job
But now it's all make or break
My dreams are like one in a million they say I'm about to break the odds
They heard that I've been tearing down shows
Wearing out the road, every single little city I swear
And if you ever hit the ground
Don't worry about it
Cause it's not like you'll forever be there yeah...

[Hook]

So put two fingers in the sky if you feel that energy it's so alive
So put two fingers in the sky if you feel that energy it's so alive
So put two fingers in the sky if you feel that energy it's so alive
So put two fingers in the sky if you feel that energy it's so alive

I'm right back up again
I'll get back up again
