I know that I've been gone and travelling for long
But I feel the world calling so I'm 'bout to bring it home
Come home, come home
I know that I've been gone and travelling for long
But I feel the world calling so I'm 'bout to bring it home
Come home, come home

My mind, Machiavellian
Bad guys, back to kill again
Who's dead? Mass civillians
Israelies, Palestinians
Was thousands, Now millions
Empty gap but I'm 'bout to fill 'em in
Here from the hood, it's acting up
Well government says put 'em back on Rinalin
Hip Hop, back to skill again
Number one reason I am filling in
Ain't nothing to compare me to in the game
Like my name's allergic to synonyms
Just fill 'em with the river make 'em riverdance
Yep, yep cause my flo's so water
And I'm heading home
So you know that I've got this locked when I cross that border

Just fill 'em with the river make 'em riverdance
Yep, yep cause my flo's so water
And I'm heading home
So you know that I've got this locked when I cross that border

I know that I've been gone and travelling for long
But I feel the world calling so I'm 'bout to bring it home
Come home, come home
I know that I've been gone and travelling for long
But I feel the world calling so I'm 'bout to bring it home
Come home, come home

Yo, yo...
The problem's back, well I'm back to solve
I left for a minute but I'm back, evolved
Put your worries in my music, lay back and let it all dissolve
Hand to the heart then I kiss the sky
Let that pressure crystalise
Cause how a man shoots up an elementary school in the middle of the day leaves me mystified
Uh, yeah, I got the list revised
Of things in the world I wanna live to see, survive
And I've packed my bags, so I'm ready for the road
Most people never live to see the ride

So I hit 'em with the river, make 'em river dance
Yep, yep cause my flo's so water
And I'm heading home
So you know that I've got this locked when I cross that border
Just hit 'em with the river, make 'em river dance
Yep, yep cause my flo's so water
And I'm heading home
So you know that I've got this locked when I cross that border

I know that I've been gone and travelling for long
But I feel the world calling so I'm 'bout to bring it home
Come home, come home
I know that I've been gone and travelling for long
But I feel the world calling so I'm 'bout to bring it home
Come home, come home
