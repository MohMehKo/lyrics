Oh, oh my love
Oh my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long and lonely time

And time goes by
So slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine? oh, ho

I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
Godspeed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow
To the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea

Lonely rivers sigh
Wait for me, wait for me
I'll be coming home
Wait for me
Oh, oh my love
Oh my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long and lonely time

And time goes by
So slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?

I need your love
I need your love
(Oh yeah)
I need your love
Godspeed your love to me, it to me
Godspeed your love to me

I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I, need, your, love

I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love

I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love

I need your love
