Look at the sky
There are stars shining bright
Make a wish, as you did as a child
Even if you don't move for awhile
It doesn't mean that you're crying

Look at the sky
Look for the first star this night
It will lead the star parade blue and white
Even if you don't find it tonight
It doesn't mean that you're not trying

Spring will come soon, greens awaiting to grow
Summer afternoon, we are all moving slow

Look at the sky
And find the man in the moon
Casting a spell or riding his swing and croon
And if you are not in the mood
It always helps to keep on trying

Lalala [humming]
Even if you don't move for awhile
It doesn't mean that you're crying

Autumn is here now, filled with colorful leaves
Winter will take a bow, with its silverly peaks

Look at the sky
There are stars shining bright
Make a wish, as you did as a child
Even if you don't speak for awhile
It always means that you're still wishing

It always means that you're still wishing
