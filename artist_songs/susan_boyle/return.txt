Return, return to me
Don't leave me here
With nothing but the feeling of falling
Return, return to me
Our memory can hold me in it's arms in the morning
You know with all that I've enjoyed
You were my strength and more
Knowing you're gone but I pray for your
Return, return to me
Don't let me be alone without a hope that your love brings

I know the world sees what it wants to see
But only you knew me
I sing to you and the memories

Return, return to me
Don't let anyone, anything
Come between us

Return
Just promise me
And forever
If I lost anything
Are you forever
This worship break into
Forever
I will pray till you
Return
Return
