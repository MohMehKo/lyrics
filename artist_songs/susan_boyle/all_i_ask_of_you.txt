[Donny Osmond]
No more talk of darkness
Forget these wide-eyed fears
I'm here, nothing can harm you
My words will warm and calm you

Let me be your freedom
Let daylight dry your tears
I'm here, with you, beside you
To guard you and to guide you

[Susan Boyle]
Say you'll love me every waking moment
Turn my head with talk of summer time
Say you need me with you now and always
Promise me that all you say is true
That's all I ask of you

[Donny Osmond]
Let me be your shelter
Let me be your light
You're safe, no one will find you
Your fears are far behind you

[Susan Boyle]
All I want is freedom
A world with no more night
And you, always beside me
To hold me and to hide me

[Donny Osmond]
Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Let me lead you from your solitude
Say you need me with you here, beside you
Anywhere you go, let me go too
That's all I ask of you

[Susan Boyle]
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you

[Both]
Share each day with me, each night, each morning

[Susan Boyle]
Say you love me

[Donny Osmond]
You know I do

[Both]
Love me, that's all I ask of you.

[Both]
Anywhere you go, let me go too
Love me, that's all I ask of you
