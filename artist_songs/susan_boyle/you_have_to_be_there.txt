What is it Lord that you want
That I am not seeing?
What in my ignorant prayers
Am I failing to say?
Never before have I questioned the truth of Your being
Never once have I dared
Never until today

All of a tremble
I stand on the edge of confusion
Who is to save me
If into the darkness I fall?
Now that I need more than ever my God to be near me
Do you hear when I call?
Are you there after all?

You have to be there, You have to
My life I have placed in Thy keep
And without you I am drifting, on a dark and stormy sea
You have to be there, You have to
Without You I’d drown in the deep
Too far, too far from land
The waters drag me down
I reach for Your hand

And when I die who will open His arms to receive me?
Who will forgive me and take me and show me His face?
When I have gone to my rest, will You watch me and wake me?
When my time comes at last, will You grant me your grace?
I am so small on this Earth, I am nothing without you
Daring to doubt You at all is a knife through my heart
Little by little I’m losing my way in the shadows
I am losing my hope and the world falls apart

You have to be there, You have to
My life I have placed in Thy keep
And without you I am drifting, on a dark and stormy sea
You have to be there, You have to
Without You I’d drown in the deep
Too far, too far from land
The waters drag me down
I reach for Your hand

You have to be there, You have to
Too far, too far from land
The waters drag me down
I reach for your hand
