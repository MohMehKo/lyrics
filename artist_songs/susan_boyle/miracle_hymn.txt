On a Starry Night in Bethlehem,
​a child was born to bring light to men, 
​and off with wind our eyes grew dim.
​In a candle's light, we found hope again.
​
​There are miracles all around,
​miracles yet to be found.
​Hid in every heart is an awesome prayer.
​Like a candle's flame, hope will lead us there.
​
And the darkness comes, let the light shine through. 
​A spark of flame will ignite in you.
​In a candle's glow, a virgin's womb,
​in a simple prayer in the empty tomb.
​
​There are miracles all around,
miracles yet to be found.
Hid in every heart is an awesome prayer.
Like a candle's flame, hope will lead us there.

​When the light has dawned on Christmas Day,
​we will raise our voice in endless praise.
​When the light has dawned on Christmas Day,
we will say
​
​There are miracles all around,
miracles yet to be found.
Hid in every heart is an awesome prayer.
Like a candle's flame, hope will lead us there.
