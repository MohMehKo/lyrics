Getting money nigga, that’s the only damn option
I got two, three bitches, I got real fucking options
Cartier frame copping, we don’t do no name dropping
Back to back, we lane swapping
Had to beat the brain out it
Getting money nigga, that’s the only damn option
I got two, three bitches, I got real fucking options
Cartier frame copping, we don’t do no name dropping
Back to back, we lane swapping
Had to beat the brain out it

Don’t beat the brain out it
Had to put them things on it
Spray the candy cane on it
Drop the whole thing on it
Bentley got the wing on it
Glock got the beam on it
Model like a T on ya
Drop a pint of lean on ya
Getting money nigga, that’s the only damn option
All these niggas broke as hell, pussy nigga pocket watching
In the cold playing hockey
Benihana’s sippin’ Saké
New Benz, low mileage
And I never went to college
I ain’t never want a beamer till I fucking drove one
Ran off on your partner, nigga Ion owe you none’
Waiting on the low son
In New York, yo son
Got the white AP but I want the gold one

Getting money nigga, that’s the only damn option
I got two, three bitches, I got real fucking options
Cartier frame copping, we don’t do no name dropping
Back to back, we lane swapping
Had to beat the brain out it
Getting money nigga, that’s the only damn option
I got two, three bitches, I got real fucking options
Cartier frame copping, we don’t do no name dropping
Back to back, we lane swapping
Had to beat the brain out it

We ain’t dropping nigga’s names
We ain’t dropping no salt
I got two, three spots
And one spot is a four
Other spot is a loft, other spot is a house
You won’t never find a house
15 thousand dollar couch
15 hundred dollar pouch
Bought my bitch a Louis blouse
Bought my B Burberry shit
Burberry [?] Burberry kicks
Nigga you on that scary shit
Nigga I’m on that wealthy shit
Nigga you niggas didn’t help the shit
That’s why niggas was left with shit
I ain’t never want no beamer ‘til I went and got me one
Partner say he got them things, told him pull up, shop me one
All these niggas they claim they shooters, nigga you ain’t shot at none’
Nigga I’m walking around here loaded, drinking Rosé, [?] done

Getting money nigga, that’s the only damn option
I got two, three bitches, I got real fucking options
Cartier frame copping, we don’t do no name dropping
Back to back, we lane swapping
Had to beat the brain out it
Getting money nigga, that’s the only damn option
I got two, three bitches, I got real fucking options
Cartier frame copping, we don’t do no name dropping
Back to back, we lane swapping
Had to beat the brain out it
