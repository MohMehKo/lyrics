[Bankroll Fresh:]
I’m having racks on me
I’m having racks on me
I’m having racks on me
I’m having racks on me

Racks in my pocket, I got em now
Niggas talking, we won’t [?] it out
Niggas talking, we won’t wipe you down
Got a hundred pounds in now
We was at the twelve working nigga
We was at the W working nigga
We was at the Skylight working nigga
We was everywhere working nigga
We was working up on 14
Nigga talking, he ain’t the whole thing
Nigga talking, he ain’t a real one
Niggas talking, they ain’t killed none’
Certified, certified, street money worldwide
Got this shit now
Realest niggas that you ever seen
Pussy niggas snitching on a misdemeanor

I’m having racks on me
I’m having racks on me
I’m having racks on me
I’m having racks on me

[Street Money Boochie:]
Came in this bitch, I was hella loaded
Came in this bitch with my pockets poking
Same blue hat like I’m [?]
On set your bitch and I kept it going
Got it on me and oh yeah you know it
Got it on me and I want to show it
Got it on me, going to press record
Got it on me and I want to throw it
Got it on me and I’m paying for it
Collecting this shit like a landlord
Hell yeah my pockets they thick
Like I shot ‘em up with steroids
NFL pockets, they tough
The shit I got on me too large
Money crispy like some cards
That mean I got ‘em on me

[Bankroll Fresh:]
I’m having racks on me
I’m having racks on me
I’m having racks on me
I’m having racks on me
