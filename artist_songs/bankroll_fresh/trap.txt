Uh huh, ain't nothin' but some money comin thru this muthafucka (You know dat bankroll) yea, ain't nothin' but money comin' thru right now, ya feel me (I'm laughin' at these fuck ass niggaz)

[Verse 1:]
Go! Black madusa shades, everybody ski'd up like we bout to shoot da stage
Everybody workin', everybody gettin' paid
All these hoes fuckin', all these hoes gettin' slay'd
Young trap nigga, soon I'm a get a maid
I used to have roaches in my cereal, I couldn't eat
Str8 up out that gutta, str8 up out that gutta nigga
Heart of hustla, that's why Ion't trust a nigga
Any muthafucka I ain't tryin' to loose count
Vacuum seal'em up I hit dat bitch with da stamp
Been workin' all day long, cause all day long I been workin'
I got da shit right here, so really you can stop da searchin'
I got da ski mask on, ya fuck around and yea we murkin'
You kno I'm plug surfin', my partna syrup servin'
Don't tell'em that we servin cause these niggaz be makin' me nevous
I gotta keep it on me, try me murk ya ass on purpose

[Chorus:]
All we do is trap [x4]
I wouldn't be where I was at if I didn't fuckin trap
Ion't leave a trap, I stay down just to make it happen [x2]

[Verse 2:]
Stay'd down to get it, grind'd from a Fifty
Then I got it up, I had my niggaz with me
Use'd to use da razor, cut it down da middle, use to shave da edges, make sure he get'em
Never had a plug, grind'd out da mud
357 is da fuckin' judge, muthafuck da judge
Wish I had a plug, you wish you were connect'd
You wish you were respect'd
I'm in this muthafucka lettin' it fly, I got these bitches naked
She tryin' to show off cause I'm in here, bitch you ain't that sexy
I'm in this muthafucka ballin', yea I'm big flexin'
I got this ice all on me bitch, I think I'm Wayne Gretzky
I got that ice all on me bitch, I think I'm Wayne Gretzky
I got anotha bitch, she gotta bitch, that bitch a lesbian
I love the way she fuckin', yea she fuck me good, she sex'd me
I got her fascinated by the diamonds in my necklace

[Chorus:]
All we do is trap [x4]
I wouldn't be where I was at if I didn't fuckin trap
Ion't leave a trap, I stay down just to make it happen [x3]
