Riggs!
Riggs!
Hey Riggs, you ok?

I cannot lose, and I cannot fail
I am the one, I’m a real one for real
Live every day, every day nigga kill
Get off your ass, if you don’t, nigga will
Digging these fuck niggas, chill with the steel
None of these bitch [?] niggas ain’t real
If they get caught, go to jail, they gon’ tell
If I get caught, I don’t tell, I prevail
Don’t run and tell and I’m serving fishscale
You know it’s the real one, you know how it smell
I’m juuging, trap nigga run through the mail
Try getting jacked by a nigga, that’s real
Then we talking label deals, mixtapes
Selling rich to pay the bill
Smoking still, on paper still
Fuck the P.O., bitch I’ma take the pill
Fuck the paper, fuck you haters
Fuck you niggas, niggas in my lineup favored
You niggas known for telling lies and fables
I’m known for diamonds shining, blind like lasers
I’m with the bossin’, down to find a table
[?] nigga in my fable
These hoes watch a nigga like cable
I’m tryna build a mansion, five acres

Living this shit like I wanna live
Living this shit like I wanna live
Living this shit like I wanna live
Living this shit like I wanna live
I’ma put a mil in mama’s crib

Living this shit like I wanna live

Living this shit like I wanna live
Living this shit like I wanna live

Blue Rari and the blue Benz
New Cartier with the blue lens
AMG killer need the blue vans
Just last night left blue tint
New condo, I’m ‘bout to move in
Condo cost two hundred blue grand
Fruity Loops stones, I’m toucan
For one pair of shoes, spent two grand
Street Money nigga, we the new brand
Cashed out, I could’ve bought some new land
New black Rover but the coupe tan
New gold Rolex but the blue band
Blue bands busting out my True pants
I’m weighing up now nigga, who paying?
Shoot first, we ain’t worried ‘bout who else spraying
We run the game, we ain’t worried ‘bout who else playing
Came through this bitch with the top off
Finger lick the chicken nigga, hot sauce
We the only niggas still got raw
You sucker niggas still wearing knockoff
Silkk The Shocker nigga, I can shock y’all
Got it on me now, it ain’t never off
Real A1, it ain’t never lost
I’m the real deal, them other niggas talk

Living this shit like I wanna live

I’ma put a mil in mama’s crib
