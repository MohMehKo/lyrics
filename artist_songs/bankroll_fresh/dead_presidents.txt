Woke up one sunny day
Granny eating some pancakes
Brushed my teeth and washed my face
Hit my knees and then I pray
Pray I run across a safe
Pray you know I play it safe
Catching every play, every way, every single day
Step back and take a look here
This shit here been a good year
I’m on the road like Goodyear
Open ears, open eyes
Don’t be surprised when you look here
Man all the shit I seen
No lie, I can write a book now
I’m tryna go home and calculate it all and have a good count
I finesse a nigga for all his money
He didn’t have a good ounce
I saran wrapped it twice
I’m talking white before it got stamped
He cashed out, he walking out
Peace out, he was in and out
That shit happened back in the drought

Oh man
What would you do when you’re down on your last?
What would you do if you’re out there bad?
Would you strap up with the mask
Goin’  all out for the cash?
Money on my mind
Money is the only thing
Money on my mind
Money is the only thing
Money on my mind
Money is the only thing
I ain’t worried ‘bout these niggas, I’m just tryna get some change

It been a long time coming
Long time coming but a nigga chasing money
I’m just tryna feed my fam, raise my little man
See my daughter grow up, put some diamonds in her hand
Put some diamonds in her ear, man I’m talking chandelier
Brand new BMW, we riding with the year
Brand new Benz nigga, yeah we riding with the shit
Get my money right, yeah get my money right
I ain’t worried ‘bout no hating ass hoes
I’m just getting money, doing what I’m supposed
Diamonds in my Rolex, on this bitch all gold
Fifty grand on me, I ain’t going back broke

Oh man
What would you do when you’re down on your last?
What would you do if you’re out there bad?
Would you strap up with the mask
Goin’  all out for the cash?
Money on my mind
Money is the only thing
Money on my mind
Money is the only thing
Money on my mind
Money is the only thing
I ain’t worried ‘bout these niggas, I’m just tryna get some change
