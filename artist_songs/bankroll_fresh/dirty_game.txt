[Intro:]
You gotta keep your eyes open now, man
This shit is getting deep
Where my cup at?
You keep your eyes open nigga
Yeah

[Hook:]
See my close friend change, turned my side hoe to main
Ridin' rear view every time I change lanes
Streets so fucked up, man this is dirty game
Drink drink, smoke smoke, just to ease the pain

[Hook:]
See my close friend change, turned my side hoe to main
Ridin' rear view every time I change lanes
Streets so fucked up, man this is dirty game
Drink drink, smoke smoke, just to ease the pain

[Verse 1:]
Keep your eyes open
Keep your mouth shut
Niggas talking, but they ain't talking about shit
All this sucka shit, will get you out quick
All this sucka shit, don't come around with it
They wanna see, give them something to see
That busta shit, it ain't none to me
I used to pray for a 100 G's
'Till I kicked it out the way this mornin'
Nigga hatin' I got a.80 on me
Granny said, pressure bust pockets
Pressure bust pockets, I don't trust these niggas
I know these niggas ain't right
Why they want take it from me?
Why they want take it, why they want take it?
I guess these pussy niggas hatin'
Outside they ain't patient
Sideline nigga checking while I win the game
Why you can't respect it?
Why I VVS the necklace
Flew to Vegas with the extras
[?]
He said "Nigga, Bank, it's time to apply the pressure"
My granny got me booked 'till next year
100 grand got the [?]

See my close friend change, turned my side hoe to main
Ridin' rear view every time I change lanes

[Verse 2:]
I see my bitch change on me
My main bitch doing side things
My side bitch acting like my main
My main bitch tripping, going insane
I've been trying to keep it in the lane
I've been trying to keep it in the row
I've been trying pull up give and go
I've really trying not to explode
These niggas been tripping anyway
These niggas been tripping everyday
I've been trying to get money, getting paid
Trying getting money like my nigga Ace
Money Making Mitch, on some real shit
I like big money, so I pop big shit
I'm getting money so you niggas having bitch fits
I'm getting money so you niggas having bitch fits
Pull up nigga, I'm who your bitch with
Louie V nigga, like I left Dapper Dan
20-17, I'm a move to Amsterdam
These niggas hating, they gonna really need an ambulance
We toting K's like we come from Afghanistan
Whole hood wildin' out, like the Taliban
Get you ass wet for a whole pack of xans
I got Street Money, can't do nothing but win
