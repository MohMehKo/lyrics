[?]
I got twenty thousand in the fucking ball mine
I got LVs on my fucking shoe
I got watered down on my neck my instant chain
We doin this shit
Look at these hunneds hunneds blue in this bitch
Pussy so damn good I really wish I had two of these bitches
Pussy so damn good I wish I had me two of these bitches
Back up in the mother fucker and I do it dab it
Know my motor did it
Snatch it when I tap it
Supercharging motors yeah the shit is fucking fast
I got rats in my packs
You niggas

[Chorus:]
You ain't the only one doin this shit
My nigga we doin this shit
You ain't the only one doin this shit
My nigga we doin this shit
Ain't the only one screwing that bitch
We already doing that shit
You ain't the only one moving this shit
My nigga, we moving this shit
You ain't the only one doin this shit
My nigga we doin this shit
You ain't the only one doin this shit
My nigga we doin this shit
You ain't the only one screwing that bitch
We already screwing that bitch
You ain't the only one doin this shit
We already moving that shit

We sure can't help y'all
My diamonds and my bills y'all
Are riding on the turnpike
My paint why don't you hit the pipe
Me and your bitch she sucking she true and did
[?] at the Doubletree and at the Ritz
I'm already through with the bitch
I'm already through with the shit
I caught your little brother for a whole thirty
Oh, oh, oh I ain't shit
Gone, gone, get my work on
Surf and twerk on
Come and get the verve on
Working on the work phone
And I get a motor under the hood
Bought this shit up out the street
And all to catch a jewel

[Chorus]
