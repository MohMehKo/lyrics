It’s from my heart and my soul
They say my heart’s full of gold
I’ma brush shoulders with Hov
Came to take over control
I’ma make sure that they know
A nigga banned if he old
And I ain’t playing with no ho
I wrap my hand ‘round her throat
These niggas playin’ so they broke
You know your man he the foe
You got subpoenaed, the coke
And fuck payin’ the P.O
These niggas playing with the dope
I razor blade ‘til it broke
I spread the shake off the floor
These niggas think it’s a joke
You better think like you know
I got the K with the scope
I’m sippin’ drank with the smoke
I’m dripping paint with the spokes
I’m top rank, so salute
Versace frame with the boot
I spent the bands on the loot
I got a ten with me too
Cartier lens and they new
My pockets fatter with [?]
I can’t put no trust in hoes
I put my trust in my Ruger
I can’t put no trust in these niggas
Cause these niggas’ll fool ya
You niggas glorifying who got shot
We respectin’ the shooter
The block hot, all the [?] hoes out
I’m on the apartment step until the bomb sold out

This shit for the real niggas ‘round the globe
This shit here for real niggas down the road
Money over bitches, sticking to the code
I heard these bitches hatin’, tell ‘em fuck them hoes
All these niggas ‘round my hood sell dope
Better keep your falcon, anything goes
Bang my shit [?] the real tripper go
I heard these bitches hatin’, tell ‘em fuck them hoes

Never started out going to school with get ins
Used to come home, see Ken ‘nem getting it in
Remember came home, I seen a million on the floor
Remember coming home, I used to see them bricks of dope
Young nigga going hard, fresher than your folks
Better tell your mama ‘nem go get you some new clothes
Better tell your mama ‘nem you want some new Girbauds
My uncle smoking dope, my other cousin out here throwed
I was a young nigga tryna get it off the surface
Mama ‘nem was working hard, daddy was getting nervous
Didn’t have no hoop dreams, and damn sure wasn’t gon’ join the service
Fuck a 9 to 5, the way it pay, that shit wasn’t working

This shit for the real niggas ‘round the globe
This shit here for real niggas down the road
Money over bitches, sticking to the code
I heard these bitches hatin’, tell ‘em fuck them hoes
All these niggas ‘round my hood sell dope
Better keep your falcon, anything goes
Bang my shit [?] the real tripper go
I heard these bitches hatin’, tell ‘em fuck them hoes
