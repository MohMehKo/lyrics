I'm at the spot and no workin, no stoppin
Fuck talkin, Who coppin
You ballin, let's profit
Don't have to cock it, I'm put past the ploppin
My cameras is watchin, unplugged in the socket
Might cop the Tesla or fuck it the Masi'
New wife bout to get in that, motherfuckers cry
Rasta little ozzy, my bitch is excited
I'm catchin my joog, nigga meet me on gotti
Bring me the cylinder, scale and the scizzors
I look like a dealer, armed in here with killer
Thoughts of this shit, it ain't nothin to me nigga
I go through a hundred blue grands even quicker
I got the recipe
I know the specialy
Shave off a extra 3
I got a extra ki
Choppa is next to me
No thang could testa me
It'll be Rest In Peace
Fuck all the Jealousy
Loaded loaded fully, pro charger pullin
Want a show, book it
Want a ho who cook it
Ran off on ya mans, boy you know who took it
He was lookin crooked, but a nigga pussy
Hundred grands need stackin
Bitches call me big daddy
Bankroll got it on him
Nigga full time trappin (Get it)
