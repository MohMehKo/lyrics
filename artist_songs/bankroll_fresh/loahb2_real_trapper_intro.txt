[Chorus - Bankroll Fresh:]
Back in the place to be
Did you notice all my niggas stay with me
Hawk's game wood floor save a seat
Up five, court side, JT for three
F on the rims stand for "Fuck 'em I'm eating"
Women lie, men lie, numbers ain't cheating
Southern fried chicken, mix that, and two piece me
I do this shit for real I make this shit look easy

[Verse - Bankroll Fresh:]
Young, fly, flashy, ashy to classy
Who the realest nigga in it? I'm just asking
Nigga pass the scissors, let me cut up this plastic
Dope boy shit, today I'm rocking New Balance
Dropped Hot Boy mixtape, it's a classic
Dropped ESPN, they said a young nigga spazzing
Dope boy shit, I got these young niggas trapping
Real niggas get it, fuck these hoes, I'm stacking
Spam out on this shit, I came to set the record
Drop that street shit, that's when the streets gone respect you
Nigga do your thing. Fuck it, ice up the bezel
I never had a plug, but I ball like I met him
Real nigga, don't let no ho stress you
If your a real nigga, nigga you know better
Keep this shit a hundred, nigga I shouldn't have to tell you
Police trusting nigga, you're setting yourself up for failure
Nigga wants to bet it, I'm a floss up my necklace
Ball how I want to ball, bitch I'm back to flexing
Sent the S to the shop, I fucked around and wrecked it
Drop an extra ten bands, it's got me driving reckless
Quit working in these streets that's why I'm highly respected
Hottest shit the streets seen, so they gotta request it
Put it in these bitches faces, so they gotta accept it
Had to how the streets some love, them other niggas was selfish
Brought a U-Haul through the hood, I bought some toys for the kids
Gave some turkeys away, that's the realest shit I done did
Put my nigga on his feet, he just came home from a bid
Hottest nigga around this bitch, it ain't no way you ain't hear it

[Chorus]
