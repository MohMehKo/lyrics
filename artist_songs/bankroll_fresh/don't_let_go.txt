Don’t let go
Don’t let go
Please don’t let go
I hope you already know
You already know that I know you know

You don’t want to go, you don’t want to leave
Say you got a nigga but that nigga ain’t me
Say you got a nigga but that nigga ain’t me
Say you got a nigga but that nigga ain’t [?]
Say you got a nigga but that nigga ain’t street
You can get everything just pussy
Your blessing, you learned your lesson
Fuck stressing, fuck stressing
[?] again, do it in
Don’t listen to your friend
Don’t listen to your kin
Don’t put them in a bin
I really love how it feel
To make your own decisions
Fuck all the criticism
Fuck the bullshit, don’t waste time on it
Baby come here, girl climb on it

Please don’t let go
She said please don’t let me go
Please don’t let go
Baby ‘fore you walk out the door
I ain’t think you even want to go
I ain’t think you even want to go

She don’t want to let a nigga go
Said she in love, I already know
I already know what the story is
Said she want to fuck with a dope dealer
Said she don’t fuck with no broke nigga
A nigga broke her heart, that was long time ago
But you can’t keep holding up a grudge on a lil nigga
That’s some shit you gon’ do
Gotta stop fighting ‘bout the bullshit
You say you tired of the arguments but you the one starting shit
You the one starting shit
Now you pouring out your heart and shit
Pouring out your heart and shit
I don’t want no part of it
Baby I don’t want no part of it
Got another argument
I don’t want no part of it
Got another argument

Please don’t let go
Please don’t let go
Please don’t let go
Before you walk out the door
You already know that I know you know
