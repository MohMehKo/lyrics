Do you niggas know what it took for me to get here?
I been grinding hard before this year
I been grinding hard like six years
[?] walking, now a nigga got six gears
Got the streets drunk, man I’m talking six beers
Sharper than a motherfucker like six spears
Woke up this morning like god damn
Nigga talking ‘bout stress, I don’t got none
Do you know how many times I could’ve got jammed?
Nigga working in the trap but I ain’t have yams
12 got behind a nigga but they went around
Working out the rental car when I’m in your town
Back gone, SS, got the window down
Nigga playing both sides, boy you been a clown
Keep playing fuck nigga get a semi round
Keep playing fuck nigga catch a semi round
Magic city monday, looking at the pretty brown
Lookin’ like a boss, nigga ‘posed to
Fresh hair, new Gucci loafers
Might fuck around see me on a poster
When I leave I’ma do top speed on it
F on my rim, can’t you read homie?
You can tell it’s Gucci from the sleeve homie
You can tell it’s Gucci from the sleeve on it

Young nigga ball, fuckin’ live your life
Young nigga ball, fuckin’ live your life
Young nigga ball, fuckin’ live your life
Young nigga ball, fuckin’ live your life
Young nigga ball, fuckin’ live your life
Young nigga ball, fuckin’ live your life
Young nigga ball, fuckin’ live your life
Young nigga ball, fuckin’ live your life
