Ain’t nowhere to go when you’re on the block
Ain’t nowhere to go when you’re on the block
Ain’t nowhere to go when you’re on the block
Yeah I’m on the block, working on the clock
Ain’t nowhere to go when you’re on the block
Ain’t nowhere to go when you’re on the block
I’m working 365, around the clock
Ain’t nowhere to go when you’re on the block

Ain’t nowhere to go when you’re on the block
I’m on the fucking block ‘til I’m on the top
Remember I was trapping right by Granny’s spot
Remember we was trapping using Granny’s pots
Remember I was working, tryna get out
Remember I was at the bottom tryna figure it out
Nigga stuck at the bottom, tryna dig it out
Stayed down, went and got it, look who winnin’ now
Same niggas say they love me, look who envy now
See them niggas out in public, they be in and out
All that fake shit you doing, yeah it’s thinning out
Put my life on this pad, I just pen it out

Ain’t nowhere to go when you’re on the block
Ain’t nowhere to go when you’re on the block
Ain’t nowhere to go when you’re on the block
Yeah I’m on the block, working on the clock
Ain’t nowhere to go when you’re on the block
Ain’t nowhere to go when you’re on the block
I’m working 365, around the clock
Ain’t nowhere to go when you’re on the block

Hey do you niggas know what it feel like
To be outside, really trapping in the cold
Staying down, tryna get this shit and hope it unfold
Same niggas stayed down getting this shit off the road
Stayed down, nigga searched and found a pot of gold
Niggas didn’t think I would make it, had to show them hoes
Water diamonds on my neck, I’m sho nuff froze
Water diamonds in my ear, I’m sho nuff cold
Threw some money in the air for promotional use
It been a good day of trapping, I done juuged me a few
A lot of niggas hating on me, I came through brand new
Back to back, these niggas ain’t pokin rims on the coupe

Ain’t nowhere to go when you’re on the block
Ain’t nowhere to go when you’re on the block
Ain’t nowhere to go when you’re on the block
Yeah I’m on the block, working on the clock
Ain’t nowhere to go when you’re on the block
Ain’t nowhere to go when you’re on the block
I’m working 365, around the clock
Ain’t nowhere to go when you’re on the block
