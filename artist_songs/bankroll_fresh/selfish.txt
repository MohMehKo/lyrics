Pussy ass nigga you selfish
Y’all niggas didn’t even help shit
Now I’m going all the way up
Young street money, nigga wealthy
Young nigga ballin’ like [?]
Young nigga icing out the chains

Bitches in the section, all they want to do
Is fuck a real rich nigga from the crew
Diamonds in my motherfucking new pendant
Swiping cards and them blue hundreds spending
Real street nigga, I don’t have a limit
Nigga I was broke, I didn’t have a penny
Nigga had plenty, still didn’t give a penny
Living daily, sinning, god please forgive me

Everybody entitled to their own opinion
Everybody got something to say but no one giving
I can help you do this, nigga well I done fucking did it
They say it’s lonely at the top, well I can’t wait to visit
Fuck the haters, fuck the fucking critics
Versace eyewear, yeah you see the vision
Diamonds shining while I’m politicking
I’m metropolitan, my diamonds flicking
Brand new [?] winston
I ain’t got no time for [?] bitches
I ain’t got no time for monkey business
Banana on these niggas get to spitting

Bitches in the section, all they want to do
Is fuck a real rich nigga from the crew
Diamonds in my motherfucking new pendant
Swiping cards and them blue hundreds spending
Real street nigga, I don’t have a limit
Nigga I was broke, I didn’t have a penny
Nigga had plenty, still didn’t give a penny
Living daily, sinning, god please forgive me

[Street Money Boochie:]
I’m that nigga who them pretty bitches holler on
Still that nigga who they can’t get a call from
Pick a song that a nigga dropped the ball on
Pick a song that a nigga didn’t ball on
Rich nigga looking like I brought the mall home
This shit expensive, looking like I got the mall on
Got some diamonds by the way, I put it all on
Got a brand new chopper and it’s all grown
All them hating ass niggas who we ball on
I don’t know what the fuck all y’all on
It’s the army so you never should’ve got it wrong
Took this shit worldwide, came straight from selling stones
See the hall got the pipes on
Bitch yeah, we shine like some silicone
What’s your light [?] when we got that ice on
Pretty white bitch like Sharon Stone

I came back in this motherfucker
Iced out with the pipes out
Fifty thousand, nigga bet it
Had the St. Regis on the telly
But number nine, bitch you smelly
Ain’t no fucking talking, get naked
Ain’t no fucking talking, get naked
I got two bitches, I ain’t selfish

Bitches in the section, all they want to do
Is fuck a real rich nigga from the crew
Diamonds in my motherfucking new pendant
Swiping cards and them blue hundreds spending
Real street nigga, I don’t have a limit
Nigga I was broke, I didn’t have a penny
Nigga had plenty, still didn’t give a penny
Living daily, sinning, god please forgive me
