Give me all your paper ma
Gimme all your jazz
Give me something that I need
Something I can have
Mrs. londons coming round
She's coming with the sun
Gimme all your paper ah 
So I can get a gun
She's got it in for me
Yeah I mean it honestly
She's so mean
Give me all your paper ma
So I can buy a train
They just wanna suck you into being one of them
Tell her that I'm not in here
Tell her I'm a freak
Tell her that I fall around every time I speak
She has got in for me
Yeah I mean it honestly
I just scream
Give me all your paper ma
So I can buy a train
I don't know how i got in here 
It's driving me insane
Have another cigarette
Have another cigarette
In a room where lovers go
Talking on the telephone
They've got it in for me
Yeah I mean it honestly
They all dream
Dreaming...
