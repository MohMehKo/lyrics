Children died 
too serve my [?]
i tied a rope i tied a lullabye 
and lala i said i tatter way up high 
and when you lay yourself down to rest 
sometimes a lemon flyeying though your head 
your growing older 
your growing older 
your growing old 
you got let down 
you had to tell your lie 
down on the grind 
your seen way way up high 
and when when yuo 
lay yourself down to bed 
through your rolling victims and silence-head
