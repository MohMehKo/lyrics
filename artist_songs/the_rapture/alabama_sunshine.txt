I said cut dead I said WHAT
I said cut dead I said what you you want
I said cut dead I said WHAT
I said cut dead I said what you you want
Even the wicked survive
They all can tell us sometime
Home again I don't care
It's your way, it's your way, it's your way, it's your way
Home again
Picking all the pieces of your broken heart
Even the wicked survive
They all can tell us sometime
Home again home again
Pick up pieces of --
Follow on through 'till the end
I've got a terrible itch in my brain
Nothing can fix it
Nothing can fix it
Even the wicked survive
They all can tell us sometime
Home again I don't care
It's your way, it's your way, it's your way, it's your way
Home again
Picking all the pieces of your broken heart
Home again home again
Pick up the pieces of --
Follow on through 'till the end
The end the end the end the end the end the end
