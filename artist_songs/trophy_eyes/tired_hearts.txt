Sleepy head,

I sit here and watch your eyes, flitter under your eyelids.
Do you think of me,
Like I dream of us,
While I'm awake.
I can't believe,
Everything I've ever fucking said, comes down to this.
You caught me,
Running on the spot,
Red handed.
Red handed.

I'm a liar,
And a coward.
I'm a liar,
And a coward

Sleepy head,
I sit here and watch your eyes, flitter under your eyelids.
Do you think of me,
Like I dream of us,
While I'm awake.

Sleepy head
Sleepy head
Sleepy head,
We're dead.
