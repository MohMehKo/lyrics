You can come with me or drown,
Let your insecurities pull you down,
I’m not waiting any longer for you.
While you sit in your mess and wait for miracles to,

Take you back.

Your life’s been slipping through your hands since we left.
You never paid much attention but it hurts more to pretend,
Cause one day you will wake and realised all you had was the chance 
To let it all go or stay true to your friends
But you slipped again

I can tell by your vacant expression that the years spent in your head haven’t treated you kind.
And what we all wouldn’t give just to listen once more before the tape unwinds.
It gets easier to just let go than watch everything you love slip through your hands
I guess it’s better off as memories
But you’ll have to grow up to understand

You’ll have to grow up to understand
Drinking on your own is only bringing you down
We’ve all passed you by years but your still around
It’s time to grow up get out of this fucking town
But you’re too busy on your own forgetting dignity counts

Your ignorance a vessel that has run aground
I’m were so sick of your lies you’ve grown close to the sound
I couldn’t care any less for the safety you’ve found
Surrounded by your stories with your head in the clouds

you’ll have to grow up to understand
You’ll have to grow up to understand
