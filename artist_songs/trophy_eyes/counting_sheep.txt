I keep my days open for sleeping in.
I keep my days open for sleeping in.

A late night phone call,
From someone you don't miss.
You keep them alive,
With simple small talk shit.
Uncomfortably honest,
And honestly lonely.
You've got somewhere to be,
Hey man don't worry about me.

The city stopped moving,
I'm alone with my secrets.
I could probably hang myself with the curtains.

This is a portrait of a man,
Morning coffee in his hand,
With front row seats to old repeats,
Of a highlight reel for years - yeah!
And all the things I never said,
Are doing circles in my head.
Like counting sheep with no relief
Just another night on my own - yeah.

I keep my days open for sleeping in.

Please don't let me leave alone tonight.
(Uncomfortably honest, and honestly lonely)
I'll wait by your driveway in case you change your mind.
(Uncomfortably honest, and honestly lonely)
We can keep drinking 'til it feels alright.
(Uncomfortably honest, and honestly lonely)
You know we don't have to talk, we could just be alive.
(Uncomfortably honest, and honestly lonely)
