Just a broken kid,
With daddy issues,
Who blames his broken home.
I never needed you,
I made it this far,
I was happy on my own.
I never asked for your help,
Thought I could handle this myself,
But you'd poisoned me to think,
That I was nothing without you.

You lied to me,
I took the blame.

Drinking soon became a part of me,
Just a kid who thought he threw his life away.
You moved out,
'Cause I had problems that you couldn't change,
And now you say I'm not the fucking same I used to be.
I don't need fixing.

When I don't fit,
In to the shape you molded,
You'll tell your friends,
My case is hopeless.
When I don't fit,
In to the shape you molded,
You'll tell your friends,
My case is hopeless.
When I don't fit,
In to the shape you molded,
You'll tell your friends,
My case is hopeless.

I never asked for your help.
