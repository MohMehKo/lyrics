Staring at a blue lined page,
Trying to find the answers in ink.
What would I leave behind,
If I was to die today?
But I'm strong enough to say,
That I have plenty of regrets,
And maybe I can never change,
My whole life will be a waste.

What did I do with the years,
Now that I'm pushing 23.
And I still can't tell the difference,
Between the right and the wrong thing.
How did I get so fucking good,
At hurting everyone I love?
Is that all I'll be remembered for?

And I'm tired of writing sad songs,
'Cause that's all that I have left.
And it's the things that I reflect on,
That make me who I am.

It happened again,
Restless in my sleep.
You woke me from a dream,
To say I'm not like my old man.
And maybe that's what I'm so scared of,
That I'll be no different.
I'll bring someone into this life,
And leave a scar they can't forget.

I ran my thumb over the faces in,
My old class photo.
We were so innocent back then,
If only I had known.
And all those smiles staring back at me,
Where the fuck did they all go?
What I would do for a clear conscience again,
To swallow the lump that's in my throat.

'Cause I'm tired of writing sad songs,
'Cause that's all that I have left.
And it's the things that I reflect on,
That make me who I am.
And the first time we drove past,
Penfold State Forest,
I felt the weight of another life,
Leave my back finally.

Is that all I'll be remembered for?

The scar they won't forget.
