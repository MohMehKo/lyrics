I watch your tail lights fade,
Over this stale town,
Your arm still waving from your window,
I can barley make out.
I still can't believe,
My life came down to this,
But it's an eye for an eye,
And I've got,
Nothing left to give.

I woke up in the street,
To rain on my face,
And the taste of cigarettes,
A bottle in hand,
And disappointed friends.
I can make it out if I could clear my fucking head,
But I've failed so many times,
Cut so many teeth.

I watch your tail lights fade,
Over this stale town,
Your arm still waving from your window,
I can barley make out
I can't believe,
My life came down to this,
But it's an eye for an eye,
And I've got,
Nothing left to give.

And you're waiting for your friends to call,
But they don't think about you any more.
Too many times you've said and never done,
And now it seems impossible to spark interest,
In anyone.

I watch your tail lights fade,
Over this stale town,
Your arm still waving from your window,
I can barley make out.
I still can't believe,
My life came down to this,
But it's an eye for an eye,
And I've got,
Nothing left to give.

I wish that I'd had seen,
With clipped wings,
I still meant something,
I still meant anything.
I see you in my sleep,
It haunts me.
I don't owe you anything,
I don't owe you anything.

I wish that I'd had seen,
With clipped wings,
I still meant something,
I still meant anything.
I see you in my sleep,
It haunts me.
I don't owe you anything,
I don't owe you anything.

I watched a moth fight the rain,
For a second of light.
It makes me think,
What am I doing,
With my life.
