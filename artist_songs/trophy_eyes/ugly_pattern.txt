Slow down,
Breathe in,
Let it go and keep moving.
Am I strong enough to start again?
One more,
Last chance,
I'll tell you I'm worth it.
But I'll only let you down again.

Relying on the patience,
Of everyone I lean on.
Watch me destroy myself,
Watch me destroy myself.
Life's too long,
22 already bored.
Watch me destroy myself,
Watch me destroy myself.

The glass is always thicker on the far end,
So I take the problems inside my head,
And swap it for what the bottle used to have,
At least I know the glass can take it.

At least I know the glass can take it.
At least I know the glass can take it.

Watch me destroy myself.
Watch me destroy myself.

I don't know what's wrong with me,
Everything changes but I stay,
Just the same.
I want to make you hurt like me,
Just so you can understand,
I don't want to be like this.

I don't know what's wrong with me,
Everything changes but I stay,
Just the same.
I want to make you hurt like me,
Just so you can understand,
I don't want to be like this.

(Life's too long,
22 already bored.
Watch me destroy myself.)
