And I've had a hard time with my reflection.
You think I don't suit it but I think I'm broken.
The fingerprint smudge on the family portrait,
I guess someone has to be the disappointment.

Poor life choices,
And lying through my teeth,
'Cause I could never let you know,
That I can't afford to eat.
I know exactly what I looks like,
I've just wasted 20 years,
But I can still make you proud of me.

I was just a kid.
I knew no different.
I was just a kid.
I knew no different.

I remember the splinter on the wooden door,
Of my old bed room.
Surrounded by so many like it,
But still completely different.

But you don't look at life like me,
I never see just another face,
I'm obsessed with their stories and memories.
But I admit,
I wish I knew just how to change.
I'm sick of be so fucking ashamed in my own skin.

I was just a kid.
I knew no different.
I was just a kid.
I knew no different.

Surrounded by so many like it,
But still completely different.
