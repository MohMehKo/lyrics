I've always lead my,
Feet with my chest,
I think with my heart,
It gives me purpose.
This old steel city,
Fuels my furnace,
It drives my pen,
And brings truth to surface.

I've never seen so fucking clearly,
A better man makes my life easy,
I've learnt my lesson,
Apply my passion,
And give my heart,
To those that matter.

I've finally made room to grow.

But I still walk in these shoes that I can't fill,
I've come a long way since that day,
Since you told me to be still,
Acknowledge my surroundings.
I never asked to be born in to this,
And have no say in how it all ends,
But what I know of the time I'm given,
I owe to you and all your guidance.

I've finally made room to grow

Have Faith in me,
I was just a boy.
Tell me I've grown in to the man,
You inspired me to be.
We spent our last minutes,
Deep in conversation.
I swore I'd find myself,
I'm searching.

All those late night,
Medical shows,
The irony,
If I'd have listened,
I would have known.

Have Faith in me,
I was just a boy.
Tell me I've grown in to the man,
You inspired me to be.
We spent our last minutes,
Deep in conversation.
I swore I'd find myself,
I'm searching.

I'll find myself,
I'm searching.

Have Faith in me,
I was just a boy.
Tell me I've grown in to the man,
You inspired me to be.
Have Faith in me,
I was just a boy.
Tell me I've grown in to the man,
You inspired me.

Have faith in me.
