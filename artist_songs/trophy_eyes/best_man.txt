I can feel it getting colder again,
The days start to shorten, and the leaves dance like thoughts in the wind.
Think back to the same time last year.
Not much has changed since, 14 Herbert street.

And my friends will all move away,
But I'll still call them when I can,
Another day - another train,
Another night inside my head.
And not a minute passes by,
That I don't think of what you said.
Another friend another debt.

I thought I'd already felt,
Everything I'd ever get to feel,
The memory numbs me still.
And I can't go back there again,
The tiny room upstairs,
The year that time stood still.

You weren't doing so well yourself back then,
But you always had time for me.
It rained nearly every day then,
Desperate for a means to an end,
Anything that we could manage to make it stop.
Make it stop.

I thought I'd already felt,
Everything I'd ever get to feel,
The memory numbs me still.
And I can't go back there again,
The tiny room upstairs,
The year that time stood still.

Midday, at Flirtation hill,
Sitting in your car,
You asked me what was wrong,
I said I'm tired of waking up.
(Tired of waking up)
You sped at the fence,
That bordered the edge,
And when I begged you to stop,
You looked at me and said,
“Don't say it if you don't mean it.”

I thought I'd already felt,
Everything I'd ever get to feel,
The memory numbs me still.
And I can't go back there again,
The tiny room upstairs,
The year that time stood still.

Don't say it if you don't mean it.
