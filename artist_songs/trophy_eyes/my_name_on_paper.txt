The kitchen was the coldest room in the house,
And the things that never fazed you,
Were starting to get harder,
Like putting wood in to the stove.

And your memory was getting softer.
Just as I was old enough to get to know you.

Mum, made me write my name for you,
On butchers paper on the kitchen table.
I couldn't quite manage it back then.
If only you could see now what I can do.

And mum still has your old handbag.
With all of your jewellery in it.
I gave your pearl earrings
To the girl I love on her 21st birthday.

And all the car trips on rainy days,
Trying to find where the rainbow begins.
It's my warmest memory.

When mum could no longer take care of you,
We had to say our goodbyes at the nursing home.
You didn't know why you can't come back with us,
I've never seen my mother cry so much.

And I watched grandpa visit you every day he could.
He would stop by the bar on his way home, when the days weren't so good.
Time alone so he wouldn't forget what it was like when you remembered him.
I didn't answer the phone, he walked home. And he died of a stroke.

And mum gave you his wedding ring.

And mum still has your old handbag.
With all of your jewellery in it.
I gave your pearl earrings
To the girl I love on her 21st birthday.

And all the car trips on rainy days,
Trying to find where the rainbow begins.
It's my warmest memory.

It's my warmest memory.

Mum made it to a show last month.
She said you'd be so proud.
