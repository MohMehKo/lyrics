I know that you're scared, doesn't make you less of a man.
Swing hard, fall short. It's all part of the plan.  

Brother take my hand and search this face,
Look in these eyes, there is no shame.
You and I we are the same.
I know you've been told differently,
But there's nothing wrong with you that you can't fix.
I understand you. I understand you.
It won’t always be like this.

We left that place so long ago,
But I can't undo the knots in you.
Things are different to the life that we once knew.
Passion, blind passion. 
Blurs our sense of direction.
You don't have to carry this on your own,
Let me help you let it go.

He can't hurt you anymore,
No more sunglasses to school.
When you're told you're stupid your whole life,
You start to think it's true.
Our idea of love is so warped,
It barley shines through,
All the stupid shit we've done,
And who we devote it to.
