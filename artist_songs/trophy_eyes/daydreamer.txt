Landed alone in a city that used to love me
Running from a six month winter that wants me back
I know it's Summer but Sydney's December
Is more cold blooded than I remember
And these two bags are all that I have left

I got friends, I got friends
They don't love me like I love them
I got friends, I got friends
They don't love me like I love them
I love them

A snap glance between yourselves when I don't get it right
Where do you go when I'm around?
These days are like the old days but you just care a little less
I don't blame you, I don't really like myself that much as well

I got friends, I got friends
They don't love me like I love them
I got friends, I got friends
They don't love me like I love them
I love them

My pack of cigarettes didn't stand a chance
Domestic airport on my own
Welcome home
My pack of cigarettes didn't stand a chance
Domestic airport on my own
Welcome home

I've got friends, I've got friends
They don't love me like I love them
I love them

Daydreamer
No one's going to love you like you love them
It's like your old man said
It's not your fault, you're just different
Alone and different
Daydreamer
No one's going to love you like you love them
It's like your old man said
It's not your fault, you're just different
Alone and different
