The sun is over our heads again
I’ll never know how many days it’s been
since school went out and summer came in
Breaking into the pool at 3.a.m
and I know I swore id never turn eighteen
but as the days march on my words get hard to keep
I'll watch the summer sun set in my two hands,
And I'll hold it there forever, forever my friends.

The road ahead looks cold and lonely
Youth left us for dead

I came to shake the world with my words
To make some sense of all the years we spent
Bearing the weight of our own expectations
dreams built with bare hands
Did I do all that I could do with my time
How can we say that we were unprepared
I made the best of all the chances given
But we grew up too fast

That place that we once knew is gone
We left it there nothing but a hole in the ground
It wasn’t where that we came from
It always felt like when that we called home
Those two years they made us who we are
They made us family and brought us this far
We ripped our skin so we can’t shake it off
We march on and tell our story’s by our scars

The road ahead looks cold and lonely
Youth left us for dead

I came to shake the world with my words
To make some sense of all the years we spent
Bearing the weight of our own expectations
Dreams built with bare hands
Did I do all that I could do with my time
How can we say that we were unprepared
I made the best of all the chances given
But we grew up too fast

Every day spent searching for nothing
A shred of respect I never seen
we meant nothing to no one, invisible me
Were the kids your parents pray you don’t grow up to be

Every day, they pray
