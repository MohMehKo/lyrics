Christmas time is here
Happiness and cheer
Fun for all that children call their favorite time of year
Snowflakes in the air
Candles everywhere
All the times and ancient rhymes
and love and dreams to share
Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
and joyful memories there
Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fire side
and joyful memories there
Christmas time is here
We'll be drawing near
all that we could always see
Such spirit through the year
Christmas time (Christmas time)
Christmas time (Christmas time)
It's Christmas time, Christmas time
Christmas time is here
