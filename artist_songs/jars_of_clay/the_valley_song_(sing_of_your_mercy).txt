You have led me, to the sadness, I have carried this pain. 
On a back bruised, nearly broken, I'm crying out to You...

I will sing of Your Mercy, that leads me through valleys of sorrow, to rivers of joy.

When death, like a gypsy,comes to steal what I love, I will still look to the Heavens, I will still seek Your face. 
But I fear You aren't listening, because there are no words. 
Just the stillness, and the hunger, for a faith that assures. 

I will sing of Your Mercy, that leads me through valleys of sorrow, to rivers of joy. 
I will sing of Your Mercy, that leads me through valleys of sorrow, to rivers of joy. 

Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia...

While we wait, for a rescue, with our eyes tightly shut, face to the ground, using our hands, to cover the fatal cut.
And though the pain is an ocean, tossing us, around, around, around,
You have calmed greater waters, and higher mountains have come down.

I will sing of Your Mercy, that leads me through valleys of sorrow, to rivers of joy...

Yeah...

Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia...

I will sing of Your Mercy, that leads me through valleys of sorrow, to rivers of joy.(x4)

Sing of Your Mercy.... Your Mercy.... Your Mercy
