[verse]
Be still
Let your hand melt into mine
The part of me
That breathes when you breathe
Is losing time
I can't find the words to say
I'll never say goodbye

[chorus]
And I'll fly with you
Through the night so you know
I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go
Tears like rain fill up the sky
Oh my love
I'm not letting go
I won't let you go

[verse]
I saw a host of silent angels
Waiting on their own
Knowing that all the promises
Of faith come alive 
When you see home
Hold still and let your
Hand melt into mine

[chorus]

[bridge]
Shed your heart and your breath
And your pain and fly
Now your alive

Now your alive
Now your alive
Now your alive

I won't let you go
I'm not letting go
