You sit and stare out at the sky
And think of ways to fake a smile
But life is never what it seems
Sometimes it only take a while

I'm in the way of fallin' down
I won't let you go that far now
I'm in the way of fallin' down
I won't let you got that far now

If you think that hope was left behind
I picked it up a mile ago
And I am running close behind
So don't give up and don't let go
