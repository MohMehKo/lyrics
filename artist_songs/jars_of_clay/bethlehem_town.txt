Oh, Mary, Joseph, rest your eyes
Try not to think of the ending
World full of empty, He will die
But tonight He is still just a child

The silent night drifts all away
And the angels are dancing around you
There's the joy of knowing He'll save the world
Overshadowing the pain that He'll go through

Have you cursed at the wind
Have you cried to the heavens
Have you fought with this mercy you don't understand
When the wise men kneel down
To kiss the hand of this king they found in Bethlehem town

Will you hold back the years a while
Will you dream that this man could always be a child
And never carry all the weight
Of the dirt and the distance and the company we keep

Have you cursed at the wind
Have you cried to the heavens
Have you fought with this mercy you don't understand
When the wise men kneel down
To kiss the hand of this king they found in Bethlehem town

And did the stars shine much brighter that night
You gave birth to the death that would bring us to life
And did the mystery keep you awake
Was the sound of His little heart too much to take

Oh, i don't understand
When the wise men kneel down
To kiss the hand of this king they found

Have you cursed at the wind
Have you cried to the heavens
Have you fought with this mercy you don't understand
When the wise men kneel down
To kiss the hand of this king they found In Bethlehem town
In bethlehem town
In bethlehem town
