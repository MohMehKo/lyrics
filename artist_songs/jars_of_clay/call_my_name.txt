I'll go when You call me
I run when You tell me where to go
We are desert walkers under shady clouds
Your fire shows there's more of You to know
Let our idols fail, vanity subside
And we will see the beauty in our lives 

When You call my name
When You call my name
Send me to the edge of the Earth
Show me what our life is worth
When You call my name

I will wait in the darkest hour
For You will be a light on this road
Lead me out to the ground I've never walked on
Only to rely on You alone
Let our idols fail, vanity subside
And we will see the beauty in our lives 

When You call my name
When You call my name
Send me to the edge of the Earth
Show me what our life is worth
When You call my name
When You call my name

This is my Father's world
And to my listening ear
My heart is still at home
When I hear You call my name

When You call my name
When You call my name
When You call my name
When You call my name
