Is life in vain?
Are we ghosts rattling chains?
When we get what we want
Are the problems still the same?
Cause my hands can't heal
While I'm holding on so tight
And my heart won't care enough
To pick a better fight

Show me the beauty of a life
Show me the beauty of a life
Show me the beauty of a life

No greater love
No greater love
Can you say there's no greater love?

Is it still my turn?
I think I'm the last one left to learn
That the life I lose
Is the least of my concerns

Show me the beauty of a life
Show me the beauty of a life
Show me the beauty of a life

No greater love
No greater love
Can you say there's no greater love?
No greater love
No greater love
Can you say there's no greater love?

So show me the beauty of a life
Show me the beauty of a life
Show me the beauty of a life laid down

Show me the beauty of a life laid down
Laid down
Show me the beauty of a life

No greater love
No greater love
Can you say there's no greater love?
No greater love
No greater love
Can you say there's no greater love?

So show me the beauty of a life
Show me the beauty of a life
Show me the beauty of a life laid down
