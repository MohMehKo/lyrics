[verse]
Have you ever been haunted
The way I've been by you?
And have you ever felt
The measure of the days
That I've spent waiting
Pining for you?

[chorus]
I can't see the sun for the daylight
I can't feel Your breath
For the wind
I don't want to step from
These shadows
Till you're comin' back again

[verse]
I've dimmed these emotions
To keep my lanterns lit
Shaken by this longing
Coursing through my veins
In my mind, I can't make sense of it

[chorus]
Can't see the sun for the daylight
I can't feel Your breath
For the wind
I get so used to these shadows
Are You comin' back again?

[bridge]
Do we give up the search
And turn out the lights?
And give up this Holy Ghost
That rattles through the night?

[chorus]
Can't see the sun for the daylight
I can't feel Your breath
For the wind
I don't to step from these shadows
Till you come back again
Can't see the sun for the daylight
Can't feel Your breath
For the wind
I get so used to these shadows
Will You chase away these shadows
When You come back again?

When You come back...again
When You come back...again
When You come back...again

When You come back
When You come back...again
