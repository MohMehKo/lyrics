Oh, we'll never be short on people
And we'll never be short on trouble
It's a well worn path so how on Earth
Can ye feel alone?

Why carry on our own
What's coming to all men?
Why drag your bag of bones
To hell and back again?
Why carry on our own
What's coming to all men?
Look around
Lay it down

Oh, we'll never be short on Good News
And somebody to tell our story to
And we'll never be short on redemption
The light for the dark

Why carry on our own
What's coming to all men?
Why drag your bag of bones
To hell and back again?
Why carry on our own
What's coming to all men?
Look around
Lay it down

Why carry on our own
What's coming to all men?
Look around

Why carry on our own
What's coming to all men?
Why drag your bag of bones
To hell and back again?
Why carry on our own
What's coming to all men?
Look around
Lay it down
Look around
Lay it down
