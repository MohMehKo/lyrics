Hallelujah, we can finally hear
It's a miracle we feel anything at all
Things we planted on the worst days of the year
Grew to fingers that rip at the joy
And set our backs against the wall

Lay your weapons down
Lay your weapons down
There are no enemies in front of you

Hallelujah, we can finally see
How the bitterness was bruising on our skin
We didn't notice that grace had run so thin
Till we're falling apart and the cracks in our hearts let the truth sink in
