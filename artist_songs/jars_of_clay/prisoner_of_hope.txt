Stay close to me
In the shadow of my wing
In the shadow of my wing

Though the waters taste of poison
The wounds are all you feel
There is singing all around you
And the promises are real

Hide your face
Let the wind run out of breath
Let the wind run out of breath

Make you bleed from the heart
And ache from the mind
The saints are singing at your funerals
Strength for you to fight

Prisoner of hope, it won't be long now
Prisoner, I hope you can be strong now

Fall into me
I'll turn your ashes into flames
I'll turn your ashes into flames

Prisoner of hope, it won't be long now
Prisoner, I hope you can be strong now
Prisoner, I hope you carry on now
Prisoner, your love, it can't be held down

Prisoner of hope, it won't be long now
Prisoner, I hope you can be strong now
Prisoner, I hope you carry on now
Prisoner, your love, it can't be held down

Prisoner of hope, can't be held down
Prisoner of hope, can't be held down
