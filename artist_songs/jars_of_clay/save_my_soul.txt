I get off the couch and try to defend the ways that I measure right
But I'm a mouse on a wheel, I'll toil and steal
It's the same by the day or night
You see, the girls want the boys, the boys go to work
Some things will never change
But we shoot for the moon, we target the stars
But we're always so out of range

'Cause it'll never save my soul, never save my soul
But I try and I try and I try

I'm up but I'm late, a curse on my heels
I stop when I have enough
I drink to the cause and take the applause
But there's too many cracks in the cup

And it would never save my soul, would never save my soul
But I Try and I try and I try
And it would never save my soul, would never save my soul
But I Try and I try and I try

Save my soul, I try and I try and I try
To save my soul

It would never save my soul, would never save my soul
But I Try and I try and I try
No, no, no, no, no, it would never save my soul
God, can you take the weight off of my shoulders now
Save my soul, don't even try, don't even try
