I wait outside your house
And sing below your window
And I look for the light to show, I know
I know that it will come on, come on, come on
Come on soon

There might be a light
Somewhere in your mind
When you think of you and I
I wait for it to shine
I know it will come on, come on, come on
Come on soon
It will come on, come on soon

And it's just the way things go
When you love someone and they don't know
Sparks and hearts, they have to glow
They just glow, they just glow
You know they just come on, come on, come on, come on
They just come on, come on, come on

There is no delusion, to you I don't exist
I am only shadow
Only a ghost can wait as long as I have for this
And I, I can't wait much longer

'Cause there might be a light
Somewhere in your mind
When you think of you and I
I know there will be a light
It might not burn very strong
But I know it's coming on
It will come on, come on, come on
