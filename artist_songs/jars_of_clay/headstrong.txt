Controlled, moderate, plastic
Aware and openly perfect
To know everything
And not see anything

Ingest completely impressive
You wear the law as a jacket
It keeps you warm
It keeps you warm

And I don't know what you've been told, but it's wrong
And I can't hold you when you fall so headstrong
Headstrong, headstrong

Good enough, how sure a foundation
Trip on your graceful emotion
You remember it all
Then cover it all

And I don't know what you've been told, but it's wrong
And I can't hold you when you fall so headstrong
Headstrong, headstrong

It keeps you warm
It keeps you warm

And I don't know what you've been told, but it's wrong
And I can't hold you when you fall so headstrong
Headstrong, headstrong

Headstrong, headstrong
Headstrong, headstrong
Headstrong, headstrong
