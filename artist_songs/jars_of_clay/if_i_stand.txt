There's more that rises in the morning than the sun
And more that shines in the night than just the moon 
There's more than just this fire here that keeps me warm 
In a shelter that is larger than this room 

And there's a loyalty that's deeper than mere sentiments 
And a music higher than the songs that I can sing 
Stuff of Earth competes for the allegiance 
I owe only to the Giver of all good things 

So if I stand let me stand on the promise that you will pull me through 
And if I can't, let me fall on the grace that first brought me to You 
So if I sing let me sing for the joy that has born in me these songs 
And if I weep let it be as a man who is longing for his home 

And there's more that dances on the prairies than the wind 
And more that pulses in the ocean than the tide 
There's a love that's fiercer than the love between friends 
More gentle than a mother's when her baby's at her side 

And there's a loyalty that's deeper than mere sentiments 
And a music higher than the songs that I can sing 
The stuff of Earth competes for the allegence 
I owe only to the Giver of all good things 

So if I stand let me stand on the promise that You will pull me through 
And if I can't let me fall on the grace that first brought me to You 
And if I sing let me sing for the joy that has born in me these songs 
And if I weep let it be as a man who is longing for his home 

So if I stand let me stand on the promise You will pull me through 
And if I can't let me fall on the grace that first brought me to You 
And if I sing let me sing for the joy that has born in me these songs 
And if I weep let it be as a man who is longing for his home 

And if I weep let it be as a man who is longing for home
