[verse]
Trace the shape of my heart
Till it becomes more familiar
To your eyes
I've been lost without you
Cold without your love
It's taken days and nights
To make me realize

[chorus]
Rescue me from hanging on this line
I won't give up on giving you
The chance to blow my mind
Let the eleventh hour quickly
Pass me by
I'll find you when I think 
I'm out of time

[verse]
Take the place of my heart
Till I become a stranger to my life
I've been down without you
Wrong without your love
In time will I be what 
You're thinking of

[chorus]

Out of time

[bridge]
I've been down without you
Cold without your love
In time will I be what
You're thinking of

[chorus 2x]

Time...time...time
