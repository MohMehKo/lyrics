The touch of lips the close of eyes 
They matter more than you surmise 
I hide it all in secret boxes 
Until tomorrow when we first meet 

I watch you fade before my eyes 
I can’t take it, but I won’t look away
Maybe the fires that feel so cold, 
They won’t completely die away 

I don’t want to, I don’t want you 
I don’t want you to forget 
I don’t want to, I don’t want you 
I don’t want you to forget 

I may not let you see my pain 
I may not speak hard words in anger 
To you maybe it isn’t really strange 
You being loved by a stranger 

I won’t give you up just yet 
I will come calling at your door 
Ours is a home we can’t get to anymore 

I don’t want to, I don’t want you 
I don’t want you to forget 
I don’t want to, I don’t want you 
I don’t want you to forget 

Behind your eyes there is a distance 
I ask you if you’d like to dance 
You mistake me for a healer 
I’m just a desperate man stealing one last chance
