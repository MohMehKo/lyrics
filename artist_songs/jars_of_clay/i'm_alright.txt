It was the fear of God that led me to you
And it's the fear of you that takes getting used to
I've never been one to hang my heart on a thread
But you spun me around and you loved me instead

I know I could turn to something other than you
'Cause I don't understand you and why you're after me
I've never been the saint you wanted me to turn to
And I can't see the view from the eyes you look at me through, oh no

But I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright

So cut below the surface and try hard not to notice
That I could be so foolish thinkin' I'm alright
I've got no one to hold me, I've got no one to carry
Everything inside of me that I won't let you see
