Well, I tried to figure out all the mysteries of love
I made confessions under pure duress
I thought that everything was meaningless

As far as the eye could see
As deep as the heart could be
Such an impossibility that you would forgive me
Forgive me

I wasted another year, waiting for the words
For things to be more clear
And now I'm so afraid, if I find the words to say
Have I lost you anyway?

For every town there is a crier
Like a thief in every choir
And when I think of the mistakes I've made
All my transgressions on a big parade

As far as the eye can see
As deep as the heart can be
Such an impossibility that you would forgive me
Forgive me

I wasted another year, waiting for the words
For something to be more clear
And now I'm so afraid, if I find the words to say
Have I lost you anyway?

As far as the eye can see
As deep as the heart can be
Such an impossibility that you would forgive me

I wasted another year, waiting for the words
For something to be more clear
But now I am afraid, if I find the words to say
Have I lost you anyway?

'Cause I've found the words to say
I've been thinking them for days
And now I'm begging you to stay
