there are no streets to walk on
no maps you can rely on
faith and guts to guide you
wander til you find you
only raw desire
a match to give you fire
you have to trust your heart

you dont believe in oceans
you, you were a sailor
who burn your ship and walked on
far away you walked on
you keep turning inland
where no man is an island 
it's where you're supposed to be

woah oh oh-oh-oh
woah oh oh-oh-oh
you keep heading inland
no man is an island
come on home to me

afraid of your convictions
they said the land will change you
steady your confession
your course make no corrections
when you are a stranger
hold your tongue and wager
love will set you free
until it sets you free

woah oh oh-oh-oh
woah oh oh-oh-oh
you keep walking inland
no man is an island
come on home to me

just follow your desire
leave it all
you're leaving all
just burn it in the fire

everything you once knew
everyone that knew you
remove the shoes you came on
feel the earth you're made from
pack up all your questions
just keep heading inland
come on home to me
yeah come on home to me

woah oh oh-oh-oh
woah oh oh-oh-oh
you keep walking inland
no man is an island
come on home to me

(i'll always be here your side
i'm always standing next to you
when the darkness hits the light 
we can stand against the tides
i'm always standing next to you
i'll always be here your side)
