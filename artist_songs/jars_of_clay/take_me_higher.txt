It took a lot to turn away
Blood and water from one side
It took your eyes to stare me down
It took the truth to set me free, to set me free

Looking for place to hide
Waiting for the wind to rise
My soul is waiting
Looking for a place to hide
I need a little peace tonight

Take me higher than the sun
You are the only one
Take me higher than the sun

Around the ceiling of the heart
Is where we feel the things that send us away
To where the blind can see the stars
So do you see the stars, do you see the stars?

Looking for a place to hide
I need a little peace tonight

Take me higher than the sun
You are the only one
Take me higher than the sun

Take me higher than the sun
You are the only one
You are the only one

Take me higher than the sun
Take me higher than the sun
Take me higher than the sun
You are the only one
You are the only one
You are the only one

Higher than the sun
Take me higher than the sun
You are the only one

Take me higher than the sun
You are the only one
You are the only one
You are the only one...
