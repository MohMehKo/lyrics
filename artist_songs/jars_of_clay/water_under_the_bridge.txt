I do not love you the way I did when we met
There are secrets and arguments that I haven't finished yet
It's only that grace has outlived our regrets
We're still here

Maybe we can stay
'Til the last drop of water flows under the bridge
We can stay
'Til the last drop of water flows under the bridge

There are times meant for breaking
And words to ignore
And a bent to our souls
When our skin is at war
If leaving were freedom
Well, we'd both walk right out of that door

Maybe we can stay
'Til the last drop of water flows under the bridge
We can stay
'Til the last drop of water flows

And the years roll by
And you hold my hand
While the shadows stretch over the land
Crumble and fall in my arms
And we'll struggle to hold on
Waters, they rise
And they carry our hopes and our dreams away
Baby, we can stay, stay

And the years roll by
And you hold my hand
And the shadows stretch over the land
Baby, we can stay

'Til the last drop of water flows under the bridge
We can stay
'Til the last drop of water flows under the bridge
We can stay
'Til the last drop of water flows under the bridge
