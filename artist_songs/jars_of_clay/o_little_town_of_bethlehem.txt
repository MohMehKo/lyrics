O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in the dark streets shineth
The everlsting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

O holy child of Bethlehem
Descend unto us, we pray
Cast out our fear and enter in
Be born in us today
We hear the Christmas angel
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide within us
Our Lord Emmanuel
Our Lord Emmanuel
