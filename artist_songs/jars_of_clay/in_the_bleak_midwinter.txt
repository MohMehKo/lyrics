In the bleak midwinter
Frosty wind made moan
Earth stood hard as iron
Water like a stone
Snow fallen, snow on snow
Snow on snow on snow
In the bleak midwinter
Long, long ago

What can I give Him
Poor as I am
If I were a shepherd
I would bring a lamb
If I were a wise man
I would do my part
What can I give Him
Give Him my heart

Angels wreathed in singing
Hosts of Heaven adore
A star beheld with glory
That did not shine before
Shepherds fear the blinding light
Haste to understand
In the bleak midwinter
Peace for child, for man
