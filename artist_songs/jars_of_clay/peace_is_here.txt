Little children born to chaos
Sojourn by the stars appear
Though your fears wrap all around you
Love has come and peace is here
Men to men in violent rapture
Wars lay sons in fields unknown
Hope to quell the disappointment
Justice born and mercy shown

Gloria, gloria, peace is here
Gloria, gloria, peace is here

Angels sing in righteous envy
Kings of earth kneel by the throne
Born to push against the Fall
Far as the curse is found

Gloria, gloria, peace is here
Gloria, gloria, peace is here

Na na na na na na na...

Gloria, gloria, peace is here
Gloria, gloria, peace is here
