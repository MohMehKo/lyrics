The mood is right, the spirits up
We're here tonight and that's enough
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The word is out about the town
To lift a glass and don't look down
The party's on and the feelin's here
That only comes this time of year

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
The choir of children sing their song
The choir of children sing

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

Mood is right, spirits up
We're here tonight, that's enough
