Getting tired from all this circling
Not much grace left on a broken wing
I feel the wind trying to push me down
It happens every time I get to town

I search for shelter near the mines we swept
I guess forgiveness hasn't happened yet
There are no words that I can say to you
To turn this careless sky from black to blue
So I'm asking you

Is it safe, is it safe to land?
'Cause I'm not going far on an empty heart
Is it safe, is it safe to land?
'Cause the long fall back to earth is the hardest part

I'm in no weather for apology
I need your runway lights to burn for me
And if you say that I can come around
I'll love you right, I won't let you down
I won't let you down
'Cause I'm coming home, if these wheels touch down

I'm coming home, i'm waking you up
In the middle of the night, I'm not giving up
I'm gonna stay, till we make it work
We're not going down even if it gets worse
We'll work it out, yeah, we'll work it out
I need your light, guide me in

Is it safe?
