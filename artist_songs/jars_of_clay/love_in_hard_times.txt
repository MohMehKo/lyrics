It’s a little bit
It’s a little bit late to
Try for something better

It’s a little bit
It’s a little bit late to
Try to cut the anchor

So if you wanna know
I’ll go there with you
I’ll go there

It’s when I think to reach across those battle lines
Still love in the hard times
Sometimes I just wanna feel your hand in mine 
Still love in the hard times

It’s a little bit
Just a little bit tired
To find something better

And the worst of it
The worst of it is I
I think of you more than ever
So if you wanna go
I’ll go there with you
I’ll go there

It’s when I think to reach across those battle lines
Still love in the hard times
Sometimes I just wanna feel your hand in mine 
Still love in the hard times

It’s when I think to reach across those battle lines
Still love in the hard times
Sometimes I just wanna feel your hand in mine
Still love in the hard times
