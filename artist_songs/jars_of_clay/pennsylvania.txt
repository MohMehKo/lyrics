A picture of a child groom on the bedside 
The flicker from a half lit chandelier 
Souvenirs from hell and Pennsylvania 
The vows of London Tower that got us here 

Look but don’t touch, hurt but don’t cry 
Break out of these cages, but never fly, never fly 

How much farther out? 
Be careful what you wish for 
How much farther out? 
Be careful what you wish for 

Gather up the hearts that bleed without you 
Take the color from the sky that frames your eyes 
Break the walls keeping you inside you 
Catch the parachutes that fill the sky 

Look but don’t touch, hurt but don’t cry 
Break out of these cages and never fly, never fly 

How much farther out? 
Be careful what you wish for 
How much farther out? 
Be careful what you wish for 

Look but don’t touch, hurt but don’t cry 
Break out of these cages and never fly, never fly 

Plant another dream down by the lakeside 
Leave the rest in boxes for the past 
Some would say that we were young in hours 
Everyone believed that this would last
