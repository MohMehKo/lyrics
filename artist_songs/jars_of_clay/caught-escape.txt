I’m not sleeping thoughts I can’t shake the God
I hope you can rebuild what I break
I’m losing control I’m finding my end you might think I’m alive if I just pretend

Let’s just say it lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalaaa
Is it better to get caught or to escape?

So give me your hand show me a sign to get past the wreckage I leave behind
I’m eating myself erasing old lines I’m still on the edge of that road a million times (oh oh)

Well let’s just say it lalalalalalalalalalalalalalaaa
It’s better to get caught than to escape.

I’m not sleeping thoughts I can’t shake God
I hope you can rebuild what I break
I’m losing control I’m finding my end you might think I’m alive if I just pretend (oh oh)

Well let’s just say it lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalaaa
It’s better to get caught than to escape.

And only grace can fix what hearts can break
