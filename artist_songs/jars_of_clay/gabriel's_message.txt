The angel Gabriel from Heaven came
His wings as drifted snow, his eyes as flame
"All hail", said he, "thou lowly maiden Mary
Most highly favored lady"
Gloria

"For known a blessed mother thou shalt be
All generations laud and honor thee
Thy Son shall be Emmanuel by seers foretold
Most highly favored lady"
Gloria

Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head
"To me be as it pleaseth God", she said
"My soul shall laud and magnify His holy name"
Most highly favored lady
Gloria

Of her Emmanuel, the Christ was born
In Bethlehem all on a Christmas morn
And lowly men throughout the world forever saved
Most highly favored lady
Gloria
