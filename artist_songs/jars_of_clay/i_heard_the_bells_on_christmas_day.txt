I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet, the words repeat
Of peace on earth, goodwill to men

'Til ringing, singing on its way
The world revolved from night to day
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime
Of peace on earth, goodwill to men
Of peace on earth, goodwill to men

And in despair, I bowed my head
"There is no peace on earth", I said
"For hate is strong, and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, goodwill to men
Of peace on earth, goodwill to men
Of peace on earth, goodwill to men"

Peace on earth
Peace on earth

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
"God is not dead, nor does He sleep
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on earth, goodwill to men"
