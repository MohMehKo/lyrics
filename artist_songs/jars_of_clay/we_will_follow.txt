In the shadow of the cross where my first love died
In the valley where we learn how to climb so high
Will You open my heart and reach inside
Till the blood on Your hands is Yours not mine?

Set us free
Trust the mystery
Until our eyes are clear enough to see You

Where You lead us
We will follow
Where You lead us
We will follow You

On the hill of the rich and city of the poor
Where the wealth is the hands of who needs you more
Cause there's nothing in our view You haven't made
No one that You've touched that You haven't saved

So set us free
To love the mystery
Until our eyes are clear enough to see You

Where You lead us
We will follow
Where You lead us
We will follow
Where You lead us
We will follow You

Open up our hearts and reach inside
Open up our hearts and reach inside

Where You lead us
We will follow
Where You lead us
We will follow
Where You lead us
We will follow
Where You lead us
We will follow (Open our hearts and reach inside)
Where You lead us
We will follow (Open our hearts and reach inside)
