Loneliness, loneliness, it won't last forever
Happiness, happiness, wait in line

Every time I look in the mirror
I'm in the shadow of doubt
Maybe I'm as lost as the next guy
You'll just have to find, just have to find out

All I want is peace like a river
A long life of sanity, love that won't leave too soon
Someone to pull out the splinters
Hey reckless forgiver
You know I'm talking to you

I made a mess, made a mess
Of the heart I borrowed
So get undressed, get undressed
And laugh tomorrow

Every time I look in the mirror
I'm in the shadow of doubt
Maybe I'm as lost as the next guy
I'll just have to find out

All I want is peace like a river
A long life of sanity, love that won't leave too soon
Someone to pull out the splinters
Hey reckless forgiver
You know I'm talking to you
I'd leave it all for you

All I want is peace like a river
A long life of sanity, love that won't leave too soon
Someone to pull out the splinters
Hey reckless forgiver
You know I'm talking to you

All I want is peace like a river
A long life of sanity, love that won't leave too soon
Someone to pull out the splinters
Hey reckless forgiver
You know I'm talking to you

I'd leave it all for you
You know I'm talking to you

I'd leave it all for you
All for you
I'd leave it all for you
I'd leave it all for you
