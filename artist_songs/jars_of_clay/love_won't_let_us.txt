I had a revelation, I had a good thought
I sold it for comfort now and look what I got
I pledged my allegiance and lied my way out
I'm climbing to Jesus on the breaks in the doubt
Breaks in the doubt

Love, it won't let us out of here
It won't let us out of here

My hands are too clean, and my head is a mess
But things are gonna get dirty when we confess
There's water in the river and love in the air
Gravity is shifting to lift off your care
To lift off your care

Love, it won't let us out of here
It won't let us out of here
Love, no, it won't let us out of here
It won't let us out of here alive

Love won't let us out of here alive

Love, it won't let us out of here
It won't let us out of here
Love, no, it won't let us out of here
It won't let us out of here
Love, it won't let us out of here
It won't let us out of here, out of here
Alive
