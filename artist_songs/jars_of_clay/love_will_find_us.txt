Child of all creation don't let the world define you
And if you can't remember who you are
Let these words remind you

On the path of the empty handed
He will speak to the heart of the abandoned

These orphan hearts (Will find a home)
Run to these arms (Be not alone)
Light is leading
Love will find us all
Love will find us all

So hard to feel the fires of home
When all we see is darkness
We forgive but not our own and grasp what's around us

Till the dawn starts to break around you
Let all the stars in the night remind you

These orphan hearts (Will find a home)
Run to these arms (Be not alone)
Light is leading
Love will find us all
Love will find us all

These orphan hearts (Will find a home)
Run to these arms (Be not alone)
Light is leading
Love will find us

These orphan hearts (Will find a home)
Run to these arms (Be not alone)
Light is leading
Love will find us all
Love will find us all

Run to these arms, be not alone
Run to these arms, be not alone
Run to these arms, be not alone
Run to these arms, be not alone

Love will find us all
Love will find us all
Love will find us all (Run to these arms, be not alone)
Love will find us all (Run to these arms, be not alone)
Love will find us all
Love will find us all
