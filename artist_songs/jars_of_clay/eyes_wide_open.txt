Talk to me cause I've been talking to myself
Help me get these thoughts out of my own head
I don't believe, most days I don't believe
Mercy is true, it's hard to live with the things I do

So God bruise the heels we've dug in the ground
That we might move closer to love
Pull out the roots we've dug in so deep
Finish what You've started
Help us to believe

Keep our eyes wide open (Love is kind and love is daring everything we need to keep our eyes)
Keep our eyes wide open (Love is kind and love is daring everything we need to keep our eyes)

We can't go on, seems this conversation's done
It's so hard to win these fights and love You at the same time
So take my hand till grace makes a way to bend
Till the things I said to ruin only lead to my own end

So God bruise the heels we've dug in the ground
That we might move closer to love
Pull out the roots we've dug in so deep
Finish what You've started
Help us to believe

Keep our eyes wide open (Love is kind and love is daring everything we need to keep our eyes)
Keep our eyes wide open (Love is kind and love is daring everything we need to keep our eyes)
Keep our eyes wide open (Love is kind and love is daring everything we need to keep our eyes)
Keep our eyes wide open (Love is kind and love is daring everything we need to keep our eyes)

Draw us in, send us out
Draw us in, send us out
Draw us in, pull us out
Help us to believe

Keep our eyes wide open (Love is kind and love is daring everything we need to keep our eyes)
Keep our eyes wide open (Love is kind and love is daring everything we need to keep our eyes)

Help us to believe
