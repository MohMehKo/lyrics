[verse]
Peace takes a taxi 
To the underground
I wanna love the world
But I don't know how
Blame it on the d.j. 
Playin' all the fast songs
Ain't spinnin' anything
That I can sing along

[chorus]
So if you know the words
Then try to sing along
And when you get the beat
Grab a hammer, bang a gong
Cuz you don't got to fight
Or make yourself belong
To be a revolution, yeah
To be a revolution

[verse]
If you wanna learn
To play the rock guitar
Then thrown down your guns
And come be a star
You got to begin
With who you know you are
To be a revolution

[bridge]
Cuz the time is right
To cross that line
To let love find a way

[chorus]
