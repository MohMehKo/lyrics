Carry me, Your love is wider than my need could ever be
Come to me, and I will walk along Your shore
Feel Your crashing waves sing in time with the music of my heart

Pour out, come down on me
Pour out, come down on me

River deep, could I know You as well as You know me
Constantine, will we travel faster, farther than these
Legs could ever trustworthy be

Pour out, come down on me
Come down, pour out on me

Come down, pour out on me
Come down, pour out on me
