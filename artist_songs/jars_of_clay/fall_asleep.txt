We wandered off like children in the woods
And let the searchers come but never find us
Tried to make a life among the trees
While your dreams collected planes and cars and cities

You slipped away from me while I was sleeping
To climb the tallest oak and see the lights
Your dissatisfaction gave you questions
Do you remember what the city sounded like?
Do you remember what the city sounded like?

[Chorus:]
So stay up with me, don't fall asleep
Because we only have this moment once in our lives
And next time we'll meet under city lights
We're here tonight, so let's make it all it was meant to be

So I held you but the call was from inside
And I knew I couldn't keep you if I tried
But I watched as the distance spread, as the shadows grew
And the longings came like wolves to devour you

[Chorus:]
So stay up with me, don't fall asleep
Because we only have this moment once in our lives
And next time we'll meet under city lights
We're here tonight, so let's make it all it was meant to be

So stay up with me, don't fall asleep
Because we only have this moment once in our lives
And next time we'll meet under city lights
We're here tonight

So stay up with me, don't fall asleep
Because we only have this moment once in our lives
And next time we'll meet under city lights
But we're here tonight, so let's make it all it was meant to be

Let's make it all it was meant to be
Let's make it all it was meant to be
