I love the way, the way you carry on
You make me wanna say, you make me wanna sing another love song

Sing another love song, sing another love song
Sing another love song to you

Bury my head for the shame, you pick me pup, you say I look like you
Though it makes no sense to me, you make me believe that I could trust someone

I could ever trust someone, I could ever trust someone
I could ever trust someone,  I could ever trust someone

Through flame, I touch the fire, you know that I still burn for you
Flood water rain crash down, soak the ground, still I thirst for you
Still I thirst for you

Sing another love song, sing another love song
Though it makes no sense ot me, it make me want to sing
Make me wanna sing
