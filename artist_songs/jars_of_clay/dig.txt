I had a big idea
I had a crazy eye
I broke the sacred seal
I told a lazy lie

I've had my conscience bent
I've had my patience tried
I've been up in the desert and down by the river side

Will the eagle fly
If the sky's untrue
Do the faithful sigh
Because they are so few

Remember when I cried
Remember when you knew
Remember the look in your eyes
I know I do

And count the stars to measure time
The earth is hard, the treasure fine
To the sea, I crawl on my knees

Feel it coming in
Feel it going out
Water covers sin
Blood covers doubt
So I begin again
Again the kneeling bow
There was a time that I might have surrendered
But not now

Consult the cards to measure mine
The earth is hard, the treasure fine
To the sea I crawl on my knees

Consult the cards to measure my
The earth is hard, the treasure fine
At the sea I wait on my knees
At the sea I wait on my knees
At the sea I wait on my knees
