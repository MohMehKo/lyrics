Well you thought you let go, but you're still hanging on
Mother Earth's slowing down
She's still spinning around and we......are getting dizzy

I'll drop out of the race for more personal space
'Cause the rockets we're in get so cold and I miss your skin
It's just how I'm feeling

If you need more love, well you've gotta get close to me
If you want my love, well you've gotta get closer to me

No unreachable itch, if you hemorrhage I'll stitch
You are tears, I'm a cheek
I'm a pail on your boat with slow leaks
Out to sea for weeks

But if you want my love, well you've gotta get close to me
If you need my love, well you've gotta get closer to me
Ooh, if you want my love:

I don't understand why we can't get close enough
I want your kite strings tangled in my trees, all wrapped up
I don't understand why we can't get close enough
I'll be the comets that are falling from the sky you light up

You're my shirt iron-on, I'm the tick, you're the bomb
You're the L and the V, I'm the O and the E
Am I speaking clearly?

If you want my love, well you've gotta get close to me
Ooh, if you want my love:

I don't understand why we can't get close enough
I miss the shivers in my spine every time that we touch
