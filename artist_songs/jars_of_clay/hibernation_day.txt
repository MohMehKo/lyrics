I don't want to get out of bed
You don't want to go out in the snow
We don't have to do the things Eskimos do
Let's have a hibernation day, me and you

The snow is climbing up the door
(So much higher than before)
The weatherman is sure there will be more
(I don't want to go out in the snow)
These blankets make a cozy little cave just for two
Let's have a hibernation day

I love the snap of winter air
And the snowflakes ob my face
How the snowdrifts make the cars
Disappear without a trace
I'll take a day dressed in pajamas
In a room without a view
If I can spend the day
Curled up next to you

I don't want to get out of bed
You don't want to go out in the snow
(It's so cold outside)
Let's have a hibernation day
We don't have to go out in the snow
A hibernation day, me and you
