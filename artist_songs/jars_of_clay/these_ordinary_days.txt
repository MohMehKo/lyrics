[verse]
Not much for conversation
I still find need to pray
Sometimes I get tired of walking
Through these ordinary days
If nothing else I get to see you
Even if we never speak
The harm of words though sometimes
We don't quite know
What they really mean

[chorus]
I don't know where
I don't know how
I don't know why
But your love can make 
These things better

[verse]
So let me lay down in this field
And stare up at the sky
I hope the days and clouds
Turn into something
As they pass us by
And maybe you could settle
For a skyline faded blue
I hope that you might settle
For this love I have for you

[chorus 3x]

Your love can make these things better
Your love can make these things better
Your love can make these things better
