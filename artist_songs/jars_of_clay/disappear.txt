[verse]
I watch you smile
You steal the show
You take a bow
The curtain falls in front of you
You're magical, on display
I gaze into your eyes and
You turn to look the other way

[chorus]
But I'd really love to know
I'd really love to climb
My way into your heart
And see what I could find
I'd walk into your skin
Swim through your veins
See it from your eyes
I'd really love to try...yeah

[verse]
Standing still, but in my mind
Trying to escape
Looking for a place to hide
Well it's not safe but I'm so near
Invading every place you go
To disappear

[chorus]

[Bridge]
I'd really love to know
I really want to climb 
Into your soul
Walk into your skin
Swim through your veins
See it from your eyes
I'd really love to try
I'd really love to try

Yeah...yeah...yeah...try

[chorus 2x]

Yeah I wanna get inside the you
You're hiding from
Yeah I wanna get inside the you
You're hiding from
I wanna get inside the you
That you are hiding from
