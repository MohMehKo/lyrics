[verse]
If I was your love
I would want only you
I'd lay at this alter
Give all I am, all that is true

[chorus]
And this old scarlet letter won't
Keep me from holding you
And there is nothing you can do
Nothing you do
Nothing you do

[verse]
For love I have scaled the face
Of these kingdom walls
So let down your hair
Let our kiss make fools of them all

[chorus]

Nothing you do
Nothing you do

O-oo-woo....nothing
O-oo-woo.......
O-oo-woo....nothing
O-oo-woo....nothing...you do
O-oo-woo....nothing you do

[chorus]
And this old scarlet letter won't
Keep me from holding you
And there is nothing you can do
And there is nothing you can do
No there is nothing you can do
You do

You do...
