The stone that the builders rejected
Has become the Cornerstone
Hallelujah

Ascribe greatness
Ascribe greatness
Ascribe greatness to the Rock so high

You are a sanctuary
A shelter and a shade from the heat of the day
You are a hiding place
A tower of refuge from the storm and the rain
My rock and foundation
You have become my salvation
