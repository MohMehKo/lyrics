We can humanize
The value of our lives
With the power of our feelings
We can humanize
The value of our lives
With the power of our feelings

Boys are blue
And girls are pink
Learn to do and not to think
Tied in rope
Wrapped up in ribbon
Dirty up those perfect clothes
Let's humanize

Soldier soldier
March together
One step forward
Two steps backward
To the left and to the right
Strip away that uniform
Let's humanize

Let's humanize

We can humanize
The value of our lives
With the power of our feelings
We can humanize
The value of our lives
With the power of our feelings

Sweet seduction
Painted face
Beauty is a woman's place
Courtesan or a madonna
Peel away that polished mask
Let's humanize

Sweat and muscle
Bound in leather
Men are free but chained together
Lock and key with their emotions
Hammer down that barricade
Let's humanize

Let's humanize

We can humanize
The value of our lives
With the power of our feelings
We can humanize
The value of our lives
With the power of our feelings
We can humanize
The value of our lives
With the power of our feelings
We can humanize
The value of our lives
With the power of our feelings
We can humanize
The value of our lives
With the power of our feelings
We can humanize
The value of our lives
With the power of our feelings
We can humanize
The value of our lives
With the power of our feelings
We can humanize
The value of our lives
With the power of our feelings
We can humanize
The value of our lives
With the power of our feelings
