It's time to take you with me
On all the seven seas
We'll sail until the edge of time
The moon will keep us company

It's time to make the flight now
The skies are clear for take off
This longing has me calling your name
All our money's just to play this game

For you I'd do those crazy things and I'd
Lay the world down at your feet and I'd
Catch the falling stars from heaven, all this
Only to kiss you just one time

It's time to take you with me
Down all the endless highways
We'll run until the edge of time
The moon will keep us company
