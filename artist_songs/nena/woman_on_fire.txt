There's a fire when I taste
The heat upon your lips
A shock like a warning sign
Runs through your fingertips
I'm breathing deep in danger
You're searing through my skin
And I can feel your bodyheat, bodyheat
Burnin' within

Where there's danger and desire
There's a woman on fire
And the woman on fire is me
I'm a woman on fire
Woman on fire
I'm a woman on fire for you

Like the tail of a meteor
Glowing in the dark
I smoke you like a cigarette
Hang on to every spark
The rhythm and the danger
Pulse beneath my skin
And I can feel your heartbeat, heartbeat
Poundin' within

Where there's danger and desire
There's a woman on fire
And the woman on fire is me
I'm a woman on fire
Woman on fire
I'm a woman on fire for you

I'm a woman on fire
Woman on fire
I'm a woman on fire
Fire

I need the danger
I feel desire
(Bodyheat, bodyheat)
I wanna taste the heat
I wanna taste it
The heat upon your lips
Running through my fingertips
I smoke you like a cigarette
I wanna feel your heartbeat, heartbeat
I wanna feel your bodyheat, bodyheat
