Industrious men
And dilligent women
With unemotional hearts

Where work equals time
In the name of progress
The future pushes and pulls them apart

Don't ask me for Utopia (don't ask)
Don't ask me for perfection (oh no)
Don't ask me for a deadly kiss (don't ask)
Don't ask me for Metropolis

Created in the image
Of humankind
Our differences are what make us whole

Inhabit a world
Where "we" is better than "I"
If yes means "we", then we say no!

Don't ask me for paradise (don't ask)
Don't ask me for heaven (oh no)
Don't ask me for a deadly kiss (don't ask)
Don't ask me for Metropolis

Don't ask me for Utopia (don't ask)
Don't ask me for perfection (oh no)
Don't ask me for a deadly kiss (don't ask)
Don't ask me for Metropolis

Don't ask me for paradise (don't ask)
Don't ask me for heaven (oh no)
Don't ask me for a deadly kiss (don't ask)
Don't ask me for Metropolis
