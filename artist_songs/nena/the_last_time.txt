Well I told you once and I told you twice
But you never listen to my advice
You don't try very hard to please me
With what you know it should be easy

Well, this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know
Oh no, oh no

Well, I'm sorry, baby, but I can't stay
Feelin' like I do today
It's too much pain and too much sorrow
Guess I'll feel the same tomorrow

Well, this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know
Oh no, no, no

No, no, no

Well, I told you once and I told you twice
Someone will have to pay the price
Here's a chance to change your mind
'Cause I'll be gone for a long, long time

Well, this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know
Oh no (baby, the last time)
Oh no, no, no (baby, the last time)
No, no, no (baby, the last time)
