You might be a hero
You might be a star
You might be a hero
We don't know it so far
You might be a hero
You might be a star
You might be so beautiful
We don't know it so far

Please don't come knockin' at night
Never gonna have you so tight
You might be a hero
You might be weak but a star
We don't know anything
Haven't seen you so far

You might be a hero
You might be weak
You could be anything
Never talk in your sleep
You might be a hero
You might be a star
You might be beautiful
Never seen you so far

Please don't come knockin' at night
Never gonna have you so tight
You might be a hero
You might be weak but a star
We don't know anything
Haven't seen you so far

Please don't come knockin' at night
Never again gonna have you so tight
You might be a hero
We don't know it so far
You might be beautiful
You could be a star 
Please don't come knockin' at night
Please don't come knockin' at night
You might be beautiful
We don't know it so far
You could be a hero
You could be a star
