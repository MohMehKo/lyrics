You might give me your hand
You might give me a kiss
You might know a secret
But you don't know what love is

You might bare your muscles
You might take off your clothes
You might open your eyes but
You never open up your soul

You fall into passion
You fall into lust
You fall into desire
But you never fall in love

You might be courageous
And willing to succeed
You might know what it takes to win
But you don't know what I need

Nanana nananananana...

You might give me thunder
You might give me rain
You might give me lightning
But with you, the weather doesn't change

Nanana nananananana...

You fall into passion
You fall into lust
You fall into desire
But you never fall in love

Nanana nananananana...
You don't know what love is
You don't know what love is
You don't know what love is
You don't know what love is
You don't know what love is
You don't know what love is
You don't know what love is
