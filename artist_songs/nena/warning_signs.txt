I can read the warning signs
There's no hunger in your eyes
Like a stranger makin' love
It's not me you're dreamin' of

It's written on your face
It's tied up in your body language

Your sentences are broke
Don't answer when you're spoken to
Peculiar strain in your voice
It's not ringin' true

Holdin' a secret for ransom
Underneath your disguise
(You're unravelling right before my eyes)
And I can taste it on your lips
You've betrayed me with a Judas' kiss

Love's no longer runnin' through my veins
Your temperature's falling again
(I can read the warning signs)
There's no hunger in your eyes yeah
(Ice-cold hands upon my skin)
No fire burnin' from within
(Like a stranger makin' love)
No desire runnin' through your veins
(It's not me you're dreamin' of)
I wanna know her name

Don't discard me like a magazine on a shelf
Don't flatter me with words
You'd rather say to someone else
Don't bury me alive
Don't sentence me for life
(I'm unravelling right before your eyes)
And I can taste her on your lips
You've betrayed me with a Judas' kiss
Your love's no longer runnin' through my veins
Your temperature's falling again

It's written on your face
It's tied up in your body language

(I can read the warning signs)
There's no hunger in your eyes
(Ice-cold hands upon my skin)
No fire burnin' from within
(Like a stranger makin' love)
No desire runnin' through your veins
(It's not me you're dreamin' of)
I wanna know her name

I can taste it on your lips
Betrayed me with a Judas' kiss
I can read, I can read the warning signs

Ice-cold hands
Ice-cold hands upon my skin
(All tied up)
All tied up in your body language
I can read the warning signs
Warning signs
