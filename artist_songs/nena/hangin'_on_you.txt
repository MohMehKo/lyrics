You've got me hangin' on you
So bad
Hangin' on you
Way back, far behind
You've got me hangin' on you
So bad
Hangin' on you
All tied up, there's no gettin' loose on my own

No way, no chance today
I'm runnin' for my own life
I wait for a year to go by

You've got me hangin' on you
So bad
Hangin' on you
I can see you clearly next to me
You've got me hangin' on you
So bad
Hangin' on you
And I'm gonna pull you in

No way, no chance today
I'm runnin' for my own life
I wait for a year to go by
No way, no chance today
I'm runnin' for my own life
I wait for a year to go by
