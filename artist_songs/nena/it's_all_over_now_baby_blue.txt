You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out, baby, the saints are comin' through
Because it's all over now, baby blue

The highway is for gamblers, you better use your sense
And take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
The sky, too, is folding over you
Because it's all over now, baby blue
It's all over now, baby blue

Leave your stepping stones behind, there's something that calls for you
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you
The carpet, too, is falling over you
Because it's all over now, baby blue
It's all over now, baby blue
It's all over now
Because it's all over now
Because it's all over now, baby blue
