Mr. Gasoline man, please give me some gas
My tank is almost empty, so fill it fast
If you will just fill her up, I promise you this...
I'll put a tulip in your hair and blow you a kiss
Let's tiptoe to the gas pump and fill her up
Give me all you got 'til I scream I've had enough
Everybody clap your hands and sing in harmony
Come tiptoe to the gas pump with me

Put a tiger in my tank, please don't delay
I've been waiting in endless lines since early yesterday
So, Mr. Gasoline man, fill her to the brim
So I'll have enough gas to go through this line again
Let's tiptoe to the gas pump and fill her up
Give me all you got 'til I scream I've had enough
Everybody clap your hands and sing in harmony
Come tiptoe to the gas pump with me

[Kids:] Hey you big oil companies, us kids will like to ask...
When we grow up and learn to drive, what will we use for gas?
[Tiny:] Ha ha...So you say things are shaking up? But only time will tell. 
Why, I've got more oil in my hair than you've got in your wells. 
Hey there Mr. President, things are really tough. 
Speaking for the people, I think we've had enough. 
We're shipping food, but still no crude...I tell you that's not right. 
This flower child has gone hog-wild, I say it's time to fight!

Let's tiptoe to the gas pump and fill her up
Give me all you got 'til I scream I've had enough
Everybody clap your hands and sing in harmony
Come tiptoe to the gas pump with me

[Gas Man:] Yeah man, can I help you man?
[Tiny:] Yes, please. Will you consider taking a ukulele in trade for a gallon of gas?
[Gas Man:] No man.
[Tiny:] Well how 'bout a tulip?
[Gas Man:] I don't think so.
[Tiny:] Well, how about one of my brand new 45 RPM records?
[Gas Man:] Wow man! Say, what's the name of it?

Come tiptoe to the gas pumps, tiptoe to the gas pumps...
Come tiptoe to the gas pumps with me.
