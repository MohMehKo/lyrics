Everyone beneath the sun
Is dreaming dreams
Scheming schemes
Wanting what they haven't got
Chasing golden beams
I'm like the rest it's quite true
Sweetheart I want something too
I don't want the happiness gold can buy
All that I want is you.

I don't want my share of the sunlit sky
All that I want is you.
I don't want the roses that bloom so fair
I just want your love to be true
The rest of life's joys
Are just worthless toys
For all that I want is you.

Sweetheart true, if you but knew
The hours I've spent

Love's lament
Wondering, dear, when skies would clear
To my heart's content
I hold your love as my goal
I'm yours alone heart and soul!

I don't want the happiness gold can buy
All that I want is you
I don't want my share of the sunlit skies
All that I want is you.
I don't want the roses that bloom so fair
I just want your love to be true
The rest of life's joys
Are just worthless toys
For all that I want is you.
