Welcome to my dream
And how are you?
Will you be here long?
Or just passing through?

Brush off that stardust
Where have you been?
Don't tell me my rainbow
Was late getting in

Welcome to my dream
It now seems real
You're what it needed
To make it ideal

So glad you got here
And I hope you can stay
But welcome to my dream
Anyway
