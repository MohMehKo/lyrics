I believe in tomorrow
The day that all wars will cease
The day all nations will know
They can all live in peace

I believe in tomorrow
The day equality reigns
The day all races and creeds
Get along without pain

People helping people
Poverty a thing of the past
Love for one another
Forever and ever to last

I believe in tomorrow
The day that all crime will end
The day all drugs disappear
All the world will be friends

I believe in tomorrow

The day that all wars will cease
The day all nations will know
They can all live in peace

I believe in tomorrow
The day equality reigns
The day all races and creeds
Get along without pain

People helping people
Poverty a thing of the past
Love for one another
Forever and ever to last

I believe in tomorrow
The day that all crime will end
The day all drugs disappear
All the world will be friends
