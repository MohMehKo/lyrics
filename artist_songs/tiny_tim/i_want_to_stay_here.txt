Honey, I just want to stay here and love you.
Stay here and love you

I don't want to go to the party with you
I don't want to go to the dance
I don't want to go nowhere with you
I just want to stay here and love you

Now that I can be alone with you
I won't throw away the chance
There is no place like home with you

I just want to stay here and love you

All through the week
I miss you so
And now that I've got ya, honey, I'm gonna hold ya
Closer and closer and closer

I don't want to go for a walk with you
Now that I am in your trance
I don't even know if I'll talk to you
I just want to stay here with you.
