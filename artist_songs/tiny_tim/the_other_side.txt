One nigh is brown
the other is brown
I am a fish
I swim around
You say I'm lost
I disagree
The map has changed
and with it, me

Gliding through the seaweed
what strange things I see below
Cars are waiting
windshields wiping
Nowhere left to go!

Oh…

The ice caps are melting
Oh, ho, ho ho
All the world is drowning
Ho, ho ho, ho ho
The ice caps are melting
the tide is rushing in
All the world is drowning
to wash away the sin

The seagull flies
in search of land
The children hide
beneath the sand
As golden toys
come floating down
I play the fish
I swim around

Gliding through the seaweed
what strange things I see below
Cars are waiting
windshields wiping
Nowhere left to go!

Oh…

The ice caps are melting
Oh, ho, ho ho
All the world is drowning
Ho, ho ho, ho ho
The ice caps are melting
the tide is rushing in
All the world is drowning
to wash away the sin

Now everybody sing!
I tell you, my dear friend…
Oh how wonderful it is!
Know that whoever you are
we can all be happy and singing!

No matter if you're out there parked to that car along the highway
Or whether you're at home, sitting by the radio
Or whether you're having them good meals
Or whether you're by the TV set
Let everyone sing about those melting ice caps
how they're coming down into the sea
and let us all have a swimming time, as we sing;

The ice caps are melting
Oh, ho, ho ho
All the world is drowning
Ho, ho ho, ho ho
The ice caps are melting
the tide is rushing in
All the world is drowning
to wash away the sin
