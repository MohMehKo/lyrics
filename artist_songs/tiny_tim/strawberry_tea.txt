Look and you'll see
Diamond skies where white deer fly
past paisley on the run

Ruby roses sway in silk sky,
Lemon-flavored sun

Sipping strawberry tea
Beaming love into me
Eternally

Look and you'll see
Rainbow pools reflect in
Emerald, melting sherbert moon

Silver raindrops drift through timeless,
Neverending June

Sipping strawberry tea
Beaming love into me
Eternally

Look and you'll see...

Look and you'll see
Gossamer cloths that you can see
In dreams of gold have spun
Crystal chorus harolds free, with love, 
To everyone

Sipping strawberry tea
Beaming love into me
Eternally

Look and you'll see...
