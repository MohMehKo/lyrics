Hello my dear friends! 
Well, here I am on record at last.
And it feels so wonderful to be here with you on my first album.

I'm so happy!
Aha! Happy go lucky me!
I just go my way, 
Living everyday!

I don't worry!
Worrying don't agree,
Things that bother you, 
Never bother me!

Things that bother you, 
Never bother me
I feel happy and fine!
AHA!
Living in the sunlight,
Loving in the moonlight
Having a wonderful time!

Haven't got a lot,
I don't need a lot
Coffee's only a dime
Living in the sunlight,
Loving in the moonlight,
Having a wonderful time!

Just take it from me,
I'm just as free as any daughter
I do what I like, 
Just what I like,
And how I love it!

I'm right here to stay
When I'm old and gray,
I'll be right in my prime!
Living in the sunlight,
Loving in the moonlight,
Having a wonderful time!

Just take it from me,
I'm just as free as any daughter.
I do what I like,
Just what I like,
And how I love it!

I'm right here to stay,
When I'm old and gray,
I'll be right in my prime,
Living in the sunlight,
Loving in the moonlight,
Having a wonderful time!

Oh! Isn't this a lovely band!
And what a thrill it is to have them play for me
