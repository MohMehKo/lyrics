Climb upon my knee, sonny boy
Though you're only three, sonny boy
You've no way of knowing, there's no way of showing
What you mean to me, sonny boy
When there are gray skies, I don't mind the gray skies
You make them blue, sonny boy
Friends may forsake me, let them all forsake me
I still have you, sonny boy
You're sent from heaven, I know your worth
You've made a heaven for me, right here on earth
When I am gray dear, promise you won't stray dear
I love you too, sonny boy

You're my dearest prize, sonny boy
Sent from other skies, sonny boy
Let me hold you nearer, one thing makes you dearer
Through your mother's eyes, sonny boy
When there are gray skies, I don't mind the gray skies
You make them blue, sonny boy
Friends may forsake me, let them all forsake me
You'll pull me through, sonny boy
You're sent from heaven, and I know your worth
Why, you've made a heaven for me, right here on earth
The angels, they don't do wrong, for they love you always
Now I love thee too, sonny boy
