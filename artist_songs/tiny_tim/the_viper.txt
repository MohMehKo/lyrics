Story of that ole snake in the grass, called The Viper, 

I was in my apartment all alone when I heard a ring tingling on the telly-phone, 
I said "Who's that at half past three?" And a frightening voice came back at me! 
"Sssssss! Ssssssss! I am The Viper! I'll sssee you in seven weekss" 
My head was spinning and my knees were weak, 
I could hardly stand on my own two feet! 
Its next call got me out of bed, 
Then how I flipped when that voice said, 
"Sssssss! Ssssssss! I am The Viper! I'll see you in seven days" 
I shook like Jell-O in a hurricane! 

My heart was pounding like a Pullman train. 
Again that voice upset me so, 
Again I flipped as it said, "Oh, oh!" 
"Sssssss! I am The Viper, I'll ssssee you in sssseven ssssecondsss!" 
Now I'm certain that my time has come! 
I can hear its knock; it's too late to run! 
I know that I must let it in! 
So wish me luck, 'cause things look grim! 
"Ssssssssssss! I am The Viper!" 
"Oh, why have you come?" 
"I have come to vipe your vindows!"
