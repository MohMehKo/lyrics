I'm a very famous man in the community;
There's a river and a street that bear my name.
And I've developed such a marvellous immunity
To anyone who doesn't know my fame.

Cause I'm a very wealthy man in the community,
And my wife is really something else to see.
She goes a bit too far with personal gratuities,
But still I never doubt her loyalty.

This is my, my community!
Yes my, my community!
I said my community,
Every stitch is mine, every inch is mine!

The symbol of respect and humble modesty,
Yes, a very perfect model citizen.
Why, when I bankrupt the little business ruthlessly,
I do it like a perfect gentleman.

This is my, my community!
Yes my, my community!
I said my community,
Every stitch is mine, every inch is mine!

This is my, my community!
Yes my, my community!
I said my community,
Every stitch is mine, every inch is mine!
