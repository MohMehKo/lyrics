This is the bye bye blackbird twist

Pack up all my care and woe
Here I go, singing low
Bye bye blackbird
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye bye blackbird
No one here can love or understand me
Oh what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye bye

Bye bye blackbird

Bye bye blackbird

No one here can love or understand me
Oh, oh what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light

I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, blackbird, blackbird bye bye

Goodbye, blackbird
I'm gonna miss ya
I'm gonna miss ya, blackbird
Ya hear dat? 
I'm gonna follow you soon
Wherever you go, why I'll follow you
There's someone waiting out there for me, where you're leading
I can see you flappin' your wings now
You're calling me
I hear you calling me
I hear ya! I hear ya!
I'm coming! I'm coming!
I'm almost here
She's there waiting for me
Oh, how wonderful she looks
Oh how marvelous, blackbird
Here! here!
Flap your wings, flap 'em! flap 'em! whistle to me!
