That sly cigarette.
Song sung in 1898 by miss. S. H. Dudley for the runaway girl
And this is Tiny Tim trying to redo it.

If girls and boys were asked what joys
They found the most entrancing
Each boy would name his favorite game
from sports, drink and dancing
But girls with me will all agree
Although you think I'm joking
With twinkling eye they'd make reply
The best of all is smoking.

Oh, sly cigarette
Oh, fine cigarette
Why did you teach me to love you so
When I have to pretend that I don't, you know
[x3]

Oh, you poor little cigarette!
How they're stomping and crushing you today.
They're taking advantage of your small little nature
They're blaming you for cancer when you can still get
Cholesterol from butter and fat from lard and bacon
And all these meats and cheeses that are causing heart attacks and tumors
Why are they picking on you, oh sly cigarette? it's not fair, somebody has to protest!
And get back to normality again

Oh, sly cigarette
Oh, fine cigarette
Why did you teach me to love you so
When I have to pretend that I don't, you know

Oh, sly cigarette
Oh, fine cigarette
Why did you teach me to love you so
When I have to pretend that I don't, you know
