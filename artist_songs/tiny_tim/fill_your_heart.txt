And now my dear friends,
I'd like to dedicate this song to all of you out there
Wherever you may be...
North, south, east or west, to everyone all over the world
This song is for you!

Fill your heart with love today, don't play the game of time
Things that happened in the past, happened in your mind
In your mind, only in your mind, in your mind
Forget your mind and you'll be free

Happiness is happening, the dragons have been bled
Loveliness is everywhere, fear's just in your head
Forget your head and you'll be free

The writings on the wall, free
And you can know it all, know it all if you choose
Remember, lovers never lose
They are free of thoughts un-pure, and of thoughts unkind
Gentleness can clear the head, love can clean the mind and make it free

(Oh, I love this!)

The writings on the wall, and you can know it all
Know it all if you choose, remember lovers never lose
They are free!
Free! Free! Free! Free!
