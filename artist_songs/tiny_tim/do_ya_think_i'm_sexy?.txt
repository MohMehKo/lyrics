Sugar, sugar
Do ya think I'm sexy baby?
Do ya think I'm sexy ah!

She sits alone
Waiting for suggestions
He's so nervous
Of hiding all the questions
His lips are dry
Her heart is gently pounding
Don't you just know, exactly what their thinking?

If you want my body, and you think I'm sexy, c'mon sugar let me know
And if you really need me, just reach out and touch me, c'mon honey tell me so, baby

He's acting shy
Waiting for an answer
C'mon honey, lets spend the night together
Hold on a minute, before we go on farther, give me a dime, so I can call my father
They catch a cab to his high rise apartment
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant

If you want my body, and you think I'm sexy c'mon sugar let me know
And if you really need me, just reach out and touch me, c'mon honey tell me so
Baby!

His heart's beating like a drum
'Cause at last he's got his girl home
Relax, baby, now were alone!

They wake at dawn 'cause all the birds are singing
Two total strangers but that ain't what they're thinking
Outside it's cold, misty and it's raining
They got each other, neither one's complaining
He say's I'm sorry but I'm out of milk and coffee
Never mind, sugar, we can watch the early movie

If you want my body, and you think I'm sexy, c'mon sugar let me know
Baby baby if you really need me, just reach out and touch me, c'mon honey tell me so!

If you want my body, and you think I'm sexy c'mon c'mon sugar let me know
If you really need me, just reach out, just reach out, and touch me, c'mon honey just tell me so!
