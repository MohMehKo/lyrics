The birds are coming, 
The birds are coming 
[Repeats several times/overlap]
Oh, oh, oh, those birds! 

I've got to see a doctor, 
I've got to see a doctor, 
'Cause there's something wrong with me, 
What can it be? 
What can it be? 

I know it isn't indigestion 
It isn't indigestion 
It's just my poor old brain 
It feels so queer 
Since you are near, dear! 

Ever since you told me that you loved me, 
I'm a nut, I'm a nut! 
Ever since you said those words, sweetheart, 
I'm a bug, I'm a bug! 

Can't sleep at night, can't even eat 
Something's wrong with both my feet, 
I bump into people on the street like a fool 
Like a fool, like an over-fool 

Ever said you said you'd like to kiss me 
Darling, I'm as dandy as can be, Oh, can't you see? 
I lie awake all evening until the dog begins to peep, 
The doctors gave me something but I'm hanged if I can sleep, 
Ever since you told me that you loved me! 
[short violin solo]

What can it be? 
What can it be? 
[short violin solo]

It feels so queer 
Since you are near, dear! 

Ever since you told me that you loved me, 
I'm a nut, I'm a nut! 
Ever since you said those words, sweetheart, 
I'm a bug, I'm a bug! 

Can't sleep at night, can't even eat 
Something's wrong with both my feet, 
I bump into people on the street like a fool 
Like a fool, like an over-fool 

Ever said you said you'd like to kiss me 
Darling, I'm as dandy as can be, 
Oh, can't you see? 
I lie awake all evening until the dog begins to peep, 
The doctors gave me something but I'm hanged if I can sleep, 
Ever since you told me that you loved me!
