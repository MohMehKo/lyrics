Thank you so much my dear friends!
And because you've been so sweet tonight
I'm going to do my duet for you!
My duet!

There's a fellow following me,

I'm the fellow following you.
I will follow you 'till the day is through

I wonder what you would do,
If I stopped and said "How do you do?" like other girls do.

I think I'd die with delight.
I want to call and love you tonight.

In the parlor?

No.

In a hammock?

No.

Then for goodness' sake, where will we go?

Out on the old front porch.

Well, hold me, Charlie!

On the old front porch.

Now, stop!

I was only trying to steal a little kiss

Well, kisses do invite me, but please don't hug so tightly.

On the old front porch,
Now, don't get angry, on the old front porch.

Please, stop!

Everything is lovely when you're cuddled near me, dear.

Look out, here come my father, and he'll surely scold, I fear.

Will that young man go home tonight or have his breakfast here?

On the old front porch!

Just call back some other night
I'll see that Pa's out of sight.

Wait until it's dark.
Then you can be
Cuddled right on my knee.

So that we can do lots of nice things
And no one can see

And if your dreadful old pa
Should come out and give me a jar

You must understand,
If it's dark, that's grand!
'Cause the kick he aims
Will never land!

Out on the old front porch.

Well, hold me, Charlie!

(deeper voice)
On the old front porch.

Now, stop!

I was only trying to steal a little kiss

Well, kisses do invite me, but gee, you tried to bite me!

On the old front porch,
Now, don't get angry, on the old front porch.

Please, stop!

Everything is lovely when you're cuddled near me, dear.

Look out, here come my father, and he'll surely scold, I fear.

Will that young man go home tonight or have his breakfast here?

On the old front porch!
