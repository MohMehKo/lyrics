As I approach the prime of my life
I find I have the time of my life
Learning to enjoy at my leisure, all the simple pleasures
And so I happily conceive, this is all I ask
This is all I need

Beautiful girls, walk a little slower when you pass by me
Lingering sunset, stay a little longer with the lonely sea
Children everywhere when you shoot at bad men, shoot at me
Take me to that strange enchanted land
Grown-ups seldom understand
Wandering rainbows leave a bit of color for my heart, to see
Stars in the sky, make my wish come true
Before the night has flown and let the music play
As long as there's a song to sing
And I will stay younger, I will stay younger
I will stay younger than Spring
