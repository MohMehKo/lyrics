In the dark of the night I found
Without my love, my love,
these words are not a bit profound,
if it's just another cheap line flung.

Outside ecstatic love,
what did we think we'd find?
Over that broken road,
out past the land mines.

I'm gonna keep your heart
I'm gonna keep your heart.
With the world all falling apart,
I'm gonna keep your heart.
