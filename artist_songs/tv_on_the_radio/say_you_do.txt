What is love can you tell me baby be,
Is it the hole you put inside me.
Yon cavernous crater young windswept cave,
If love is my salvation I don't want to be saved.

But I never met a girl like you.
Someone who made that dumb shit true
So oo oo.

(Love me love me love me, say you do)

When you do,
Won't you say you do.

(Love me love me love me, say you do)

Say you do.

Full capacity mind wake suck sanity I fake,
Not much more that I can take before I start to bend a break.
Burn the Indian sky the sea, I blot out every memory,
And then I solemn vow I swear, I'll never ever ever fall again.

But I never met a girl like you,
Someone to keep my black heart blue.
And I'll always stay a little bit me,
The portrait of complicity.


Well its a lovely picture of me,
Hanging on the stars above me, Screaming girl why don't you love me.

Well its a lovely picture of me,
Hanging on the stars above me, Screaming girl why don't you love me.

Well its a lovely picture of me,
Hanging on the stars above me, Screaming girl why don't you love me.

Well its a lovely picture of me,
Hanging on the stars above me, Screaming girl why don't you love me.
(Lovely picture of me)
Say you do

(Love me love me love me, say you do)
(Love me love me love me, say you do)

Full capacity hard wake suck sanity I fake,
Not much more that I can take before I start to bend a break.
Burn the Indian sky the sea, I blot out every memory,
And then I solemn vow I swear, I'll never ever ever fall again.
