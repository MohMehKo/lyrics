Me, I
Made my bed for the very first time...
Today!

Me, I, me, I
Made my bed for the very first time...
Today!

Me, I
Walked around with
Hospital corners

Me, I
When my momma said, "What'd you do today?"
I said, "Momma, I just... I just..."


Me, I
Made my bed for the very first time...
Today! Aaaaaa-aaaa-a-aaaaaa-ay!

Me, I
Built in pillows that hold the shape of
Hospital corners

Me, I
When my momma said, "What'd did you do?"
I just said, "Me, I"

Momma!
Momma!
Momma!
Momma!
Momma!
Momma!
Momma!
Momma!

Me, I
Made my bed for the very first time...
Today!

Me, I
Made my bed for the very first time...
Today!

Well, momma said...
She said, "Son, what you been doin' all day?"
And I said, "I'm tryin' to make a place for myself..."

Where I can dream
Where I can dream
Where I can dream
Where I can dream
Where I can dream
Where I can dream
Where I can dream
Where I can dream
Where I can dream
Where I can dream
Where I can dream
Where I can dream

And never, ever have to wake up.
