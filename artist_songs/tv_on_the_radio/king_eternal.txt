All men condemned by men to die
Damned by blind bitch in hallowed halls
Hear it, heed this call:

Oh fucking eternal

Infinity's hourglass will measure all measure all
So, power

Cover your balls
'Cause we swing kung fu

Oh fucking eternal
Oh fucking eternal

Afraid of thunder children, so hide your ears
Hope your fortress holds up for many many many years
Shudder, it's a shame
Lightning, call the game
Send us up a baby boy
Let the smoke carry his name

If it's a girl let her shine

We will be

Oh fucking eternal

The hour of man is nigh
So gather up all supplies
And stack 'em up high
Stack 'em up high

Faith, Nathan I could see it in your eyes
Warmth, Nathan I can see it in your eyes

Golden houses, silver brides
Immortal erection, tongues untied

Oh fucking eternal
Oh fucking
