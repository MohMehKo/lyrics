I caught a glimpse of professional evil, 
On the day our poor hearts died
I fell in love with professional evil, 
On the day you left my side

I see tons of people looking lost and lethal
And I think we're all the same
So I scale the steeple and I take a leap, 
But I just cant keep the stain,

From my soul
It burns so cold,
Its got to go

Its into my soul
Its into my soul

Things fall apart in the blink of an eye, 
Better keep yours open wide
Things fall apart in the blink of an eye,
No they cant be satisfied

I see tons of people looking lost and lethal,
And I know we're all the same
But now its gone forever, 
And there's nothing to keep
But I still cant scratch the stain,

From my soul
It burns so cold
Oh watch it go,
Through my soul

Have mercy lord
Why cant we do
back over me, back over you
back overboard
by two by two
back over me, back over you

I know My life,can be my life
My life can be my life

Have mercy lord, on my life
Have mercy lord
Have mercy
have mercy mercy mercy, on my life
