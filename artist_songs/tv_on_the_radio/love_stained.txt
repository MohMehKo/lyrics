Funny now it's all out
See what only nakedness could hide
Something's got you tongue tied
Like you're barely handling the ride
Sentimental storm clouds gathering
Let's try to pray them down
But they've been there the whole time
Following from crib, to crawl
To walk, to run, to slow

Live and die for it
Simulating blood baths in bed
We're red, we're wed
And unembarrassed to dare this affair with
No brutalized romance or criticized slow dance
Your head's your head
But still we're not afraid to share this with careful awareness

In the middle of the night, when fear comes calling
Sayin' "it all dies, often scared, alone..."
I look into your eyes and feel your calm
Pretty thing that catches me so strong when I fall

Another shining morning
Hand to breast
Griefs got you by the lungs
Wanna cease the mourning
But it seems that sad songs never done
Drop cold feet to floor and
Suddenly the whole thing weighs a ton
Same body that you dance in
Bring it back to me, lick, and roll, and raise your inner sun

Live and die for it
Swearing by black mass in bed
We're fed, we're wed
And unembarrassed to share this affair with
No brutalized romance or criticized slow dance
My head's my head, but still we're not afraid
To say for ourselves what a pair is

In the middle of the light, just wanna be your darling
Running by your side, let me play along
Look into your eyes, see the love we're born in
Hear your heart so sweetly beat, just wanna sing its song
Everything's alright, just let me be your darling
Running by your side, nevermore alone
Look into your eyes and see the love we're born in
Hear your heart so sweetly beat, just wanna hear its song
