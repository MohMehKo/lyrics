I seen a girl
With a guy
With hair like yours
From what I remember

He took her hand
And smiled her name
Her face like yours
She smiled the same

From what I remember
Been so long since last December
She walked your walk
She talked like you

She shimmered strong
She shined right through
From what I remember
I said I seen a girl

With a guy
So who I'd seen
So who am I
Now I can't remember


Been so long since last December
So I'm sending
Open letter to the perfect girlfriend

I'm still mighty tiny
Hoping that you'd be my little godsend
Because right now I'll take any and blindly
Before I find another noose to fit us

Before we choose another hand to hit us
Let us ask each other
What's the difference
Because if you save yourself

I'll save you all the time
Open letter to the legions leering
Oh, how we entertained you
Why don't you cast your gaze into the moonlit clearing

Cause my love, my love is a suckerbet
Before I find another noose to fit us
Before we choose another hand to hit us
Let us ask each other

What's the problem
Why don't you save yourself 
I'll save you all the time
Because if you save yourself

I'll save you all the time
Now what's to blame
Save yourself, I'll save you all the time
Now what's to blame 

Save yourself, I'll save you all the time (x2)
