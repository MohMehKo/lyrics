Hope everything is all right 
Hope everything is all right 

What's that floatin' in the water?
Oh, Neptuna's only daughter
I believe in Mr. Grieves
Pray for a man in the middle
One that talks like Doolittle
I believe in Mr. Grieves
Do you have another opinion?
Do you have another opinion?

You can cry, you can mope
But can you swing from a good good rope?
Oh, I believe in Mr. Grieves
Oh, I believe in Mr. Grieves

Hope everything is all right 
Hope everything is all right

Got fallen, got frozen
Got finally up to the finally dozin'
I believe in Mr. Grieves
I believe in Mr. Grieves
