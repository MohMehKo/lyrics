Out on the freeway
I saw you wasted
Nobody wants you to fall
Except for me

(Dentle plain, marriges, lots of babies, dentogen)
Except for me
(Press hot sex, Fuck more and love less)
Call me up daily
Just to remind me
Nobody wants you at all
Except for me

(Charity Charity, Everybody look at me)
Except for me
(Wanna be so alike I'm finishing, Finishing, finishing, finishing)
Your so important
That you stay untouched
You start to cry
And when we go pink dutch
You've always wondered
Why i don't say much
Well lets see how well you walk
Without a crutch

(One two, one two, one two three four)
I really hate you
Still trying to shake you
Nobody's going to call
Except for me
(No, it's not logical, it's biological)
Except for me
(And if you're willing, it's us I'm killing)

Got a new girlfriend
Is she a godsend
Or is she just methadone?
I'll wait and see
(They say it's darkest just before the crowded light)
If I stay clean
(You gotta fuck somebody over 'fore you get it right)

You're seeing someone now
For what that's worth
He's got your love
And so they'll have your curse
Freeway of love in a check black hearse
And I really can not think
Of what that's worth
And I really can not think
Of what would be worse

Can I think of one more verse....
(Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up with your verse! Shut up!)
