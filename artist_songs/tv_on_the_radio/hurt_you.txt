Woahhhhhhhh

(slow times for you?)
(slow times for you.)
(what's a boy to do?)

From my parapet I spy out the corner of my eye
On the street where you walk on by your beauty on the run from me
Come to me, I beckon but I reckon since it's mentally
Not dust to thee, my density can hinder your mobility
So what? another vision fades into the twisted (faded) cityscapes
Like trying to find twin snowflakes looking for another heart to break
Oh, she break me equally I pray to my dead god to send
A sullen siren just to silence my automaton tongue

Tell me what to do
So I don't hurt you

Tell me what to do
So I don't hurt you

Tell me what to do
(won't you please now)
So I don't hurt you

Tell me what to do
So I don't hurt you

He came through, blank book, on the train, new catastrophe
My god, there's a body on the train right in front of me
Don't look, she's a demon, strolls the sewers, no apologies
I need a dirty girl to help me brush up my biology
This way to a place, she's right in front of me
I can pray, and she got it 'cuz she got it where she wants to be
Run through, spread down like a naked buffet
We gonna (mangerie[?]) and then play for days

So first we spark and blaze and then we go away
And then we go away and then we go three way
(And then we shift our fate and then my baby say)
So first we spark and blaze and then we blow away
(So first we spark and blaze and then we play for days)
And then we play for days and then we go away
(And then we spark and blaze and then we go three way)
And then we spark and blaze and then we play for days
(And then my baby says and then we spark and blaze)
And then we go three way and the my baby say
(And then we go three way and then we shift our face)

And then my baby says and then my baby says
And then my baby says and then my baby says

Tell me what to do
So I can hurt you

Tell me what to do
So I can hurt you

Tell me what to do
So I can hurt you

Tell me what to do
So I can hurt you

Roll out from the bedside and cut from the past
Roll home, kicking lovely and lonely at last
Cigarette all ablaze as I tread the rat's maze
And I see every passing beauty, all these mindless cuties
All this youthful booty for a boy to tap
Better fall into my chamber 'fore I fall into the trap
A skin addiction, a benediction for all my pistons
Every lay in moderation on this permanent vacation

I'm fading
Oh, I can't keep fading
All's after
I'm fading

woahhhhhhhh

(empty bed, empty head)
(slow times for me is slow times for you too, I guess)
(but I'm just a sweaty city dweller slumbering softly 'til the morning bell's knell demands I navigate leftover hell)
