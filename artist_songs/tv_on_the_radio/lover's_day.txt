Oh but the longing is terrible
A wanton heart under attack
I wanna love you all the way off
I wanna break your back

Colour of all that's hysterical
Travels along your bones
Just to be near you
Sucking your skin
Not gonna leave you alone

Yes here of course there are miracles
A lover that loves that's one
Groomed with the laughter
Ecstatic disaster
Come let's arouse the fun

We could build an engine
Out of all your rising stars
Tear apart the apart
We seem to think we are
Call off work let's lay
Call it lovers day
Call it lovers day

Give me the keys to your hiding place
I'm not gonna tear it apart
I'm gonna keep you weak in the knees
Try to unlock your heart

You're gonna turn me animal
You're gonna turn me dumb
Your kiss in the night
Bringing the light
You're like the rising sun

I hunger for you like a cannibal
Not gonna let you run
I'm gonna take you
I'm gonna shake you
I'm gonna make you cum

Swear to God it'll get so hot
It'll melt our faces off
Then we can see
The you the me
Beyond mirrors outside clock
Held naked in the light
Held gently held tight
So soft
Get Off
Get Off

Ball so hard we'll smash the walls
Break the bed
And Crash the floors
Don't Stop
Laugh and Scream
And have the neighbors call the cops
Till all the eyes that've seen our fire play

Can't forget
Mark it down
Call it lovers day

Yes here of course there are miracles
Under your sighs and moans
I'm Gonna take you
I'm Gonna take you
I'm Gonna take you home
