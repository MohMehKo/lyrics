Embrace me
My sweet embraceable you
Embrace me
You irreplaceable you
Just one look at you, 
My heart could tipsy in me
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me

I love all
The many charms about you
Above all
I want my arms about you
Don't be a naughty baby
Come to mama
Come to mama
My sweet embraceable you

I love all
The many charms about you
Above all
I want my arms about you
Don't be a naughty baby
Come to mama
Come to mama
My sweet embraceable you
