Summertime, and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
Your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'
So hush little baby, don't you cry

One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing, singing
And you'll spread your wings and you'll take to the sky
But 'til that morning, there ain't nothin' can harm you
With daddy and your dammy standin' by
Don't you cry, don't you cry
Don't you cry, don't you cry
