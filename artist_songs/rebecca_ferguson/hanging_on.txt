Every hurt I will keep
Like gold in my pockets
And every step I will take
Feel a heavier weight

Yea I lost my way
But I'll find my way home
I'll shine like a pearl
In a sheath filled with stones

[x2]
I'm gonna throw it away
(No hanging on, no hanging on to all my troubles)
I'm gonna throw it away
(No hanging on, no hanging on)
I'm gonna throw it away
(No hanging on, no hanging on to all my troubles)
I'm gonna throw it away
(No hanging on, no hanging on, no hanging on)

I'll find peace in my mind
Take back this life that's been given
As I watch the night skies
In my shadow there's still light

But I lost my way
I'll find my way home
I'll be just like a pearl
In a sheath filled with stones

[x2]
I'm gonna throw it away
(No hanging on, no hanging on to all my troubles)
I'm gonna throw it away
(No hanging on, no hanging on)
I'm gonna throw it away
(No hanging on, no hanging on to all my troubles)
I'm gonna throw it away
(No hanging on, no hanging on, no hanging on)

Higher, higher, higher, higher
I'll be higher, higher, higher, higher
And I'll be higher, higher, higher, higher
I'll be higher (higher)

[x2]
I'm gonna throw it away
(No hanging on, no hanging on to all my troubles)
I'm gonna throw it away
(No hanging on, no hanging on)
I'm gonna throw it away
(No hanging on, no hanging on to all my troubles)
I'm gonna throw it away
(No hanging on, no hanging on, no hanging on)
