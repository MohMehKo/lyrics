Hey when you get tired
When you’re waiting for a train
When nothing’s exciting you
I’m probably thinking about you then

Every time you cross my mind
You’re like a prayer, a precious sign, sign, sign, sign…

Hear my prayer now
Just say the word and I could be there now
Oh I say my prayer now
Just give me time and I will be there now

Oh, you’re too good to lose
You’re too good to lose
You’re too good to lose
You’re too good to lose

Hey I lost my phone
It must have fallen out in the street
Maybe you called and I didn’t pick up
And if you wondered that’s all it means

All I touch and all I see
I give it up so freely

Hear my prayer now
Just say the word and I could be there now
Oh I say my prayer now
Just give me time and I will be there now

Hear my prayer now
Just say the word and I could be there now
Oh I say my prayer now
Just give me time and I will be there now

Oh, you’re too good to lose
You’re too good to lose
You’re too good to lose
You’re too good to lose
[repeat]

I’ll be there when you get lost,
When you need somebody,
Keep your name on my heart, because
Because

Hear my prayer now
Just give me time and I will be there now
Oh I say my prayer now
Just say the words and I could be there now

Oh, you’re too good to lose
You’re too good to lose
You’re too good to lose
You’re too good to lose
[repeat]
