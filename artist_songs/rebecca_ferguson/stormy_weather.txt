Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all of the time
raining all of the time

And my life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather, 
Just can't get my poor self back together
Weary all of the time, weary all of the time
so weary all of the time

When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away
That old rocking chair's gonna get me
So I'll just sit here and pray
That Lord will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on,
Everything I have is gone
Stormy weather, stormy weather
Since my man and I, ain't together
Keep on raining all of the time
keep on raining all of the time
Stormy weather
