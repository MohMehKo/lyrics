Hallelujah, Hallelujah
I'm your sinner, gather 'round
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
All the sinners I have found
A land where the will forever run free
Come you sinners, just follow me

Forget your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Sing Hallelujah, c'mon get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day!
The sun is shinin', c'mon get happy
The Lord is waiting to take your hand
Shout Hallelujah, c'mon get happy
We're goin' to the Promised Land!

We're headin' 'cross the river
Wash our sins away in the tide
It's all so peaceful, on the other side

Forget your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Sing Hallelujah, c'mon get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day!

We're headin' across the river
Wash our sins away in the tide
It's all so peaceful, on the other side

Forget your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Sing Hallelujah, c'mon get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day!

Sing Hallelujah
Sing Hallelujah
Sing Hallelujah
Sing Hallelujah c'mon get happy
C'mon c'mon get happy
C'mon c'mon get happy
Someone is waiting to take your hand

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
You better chase all your cares away
