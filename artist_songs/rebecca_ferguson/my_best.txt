It's never easy so don't give me that excuse
It was never meant to be
You're scared of losing so you'd rather hide the truth
But it's so obvious to me

So don't (so, don't)
Lose faith (lose, faith)
When you feel like your mind's about to break (about to break)
Don't (so don't)
Fall away (fall away)
When the battle's just about to break (about to break)

'Cause you're at your best
When you give what you get
'Cause you're at your best
When there's nothing else left 

Oh family, I got that
Bills paid, I got that
One love, I got that
Lord knows I got that ('cause you're at your best)
When there's nothing else left, no no

The storm surrounds you but you're always shining through
I guess a diamond never breaks
When stuff is going down you always keep your cool
'Cause that's just the way you're made

So don't (so, don't)
Lose faith (lose, faith)
When you feel like your mind's about to break (about to break)
So don't (so don't)
Fall away (fall away)
When the battle's just about to break (about to break)

'Cause you're at your best
When you give what you get
'Cause you're at your best
When there's nothing else left 

Oh family, I got that
Bills paid, I got that
One love, I got that
Lord knows I got that (cause you're at your best)
When there's nothing else left, no no

Maybe it feels like it's all got too much
Hear the sounds of your world falling
But don't give in
Just smile through your,
Just smile through your,
Just smile through your pain
Just smile through your days
Just smile through your,
Just smile through your,
Just smile through your day cause you're

'Cause you're at your best
When you give what you get
'Cause you're at your best
When there's nothing else left 

Oh family, I got that
Bills paid, I got that
One love, I got that
Lord knows I got that (cause you're at your best)
When there's nothing else left, no no
