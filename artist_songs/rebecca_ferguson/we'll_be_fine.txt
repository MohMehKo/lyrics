When you're lonely
Don't be afraid, I'll keep your heart close to mine
Lay safely in my arms
Lay safely in my arms

When you're falling
No you won't stay down
'Cause I will hold you
Lay safely in my arms
Lay safely in my arms

When you feel you've had enough
From this world that's giving up on you
On you
When you feel you've had enough
From this world that's giving up don't you
Don't you

Sometimes we get lost walking through the fire
And when it all turns to dust
We'll watch the ashes light up and we'll rise
We'll rise

And we'll be fine 
(yeah we'll be, yeah we'll be)
(yeah we'll be, yeah we'll be)
And we'll be fine 
(yeah we'll be, yeah we'll be)
(yeah we'll be, yeah we'll be)

You'll find peace
As the sun falls on you
Cry victory
With your head held high

When you feel you've had enough
From this world that's giving up on you
On you
When you feel you've had enough
From this world that's giving up don't you
Don't you

Sometimes we get lost walking through the fire
And when it all turns to dust
We'll watch the ashes light up and we'll rise
We'll rise

And we'll be fine 
(yeah we'll be, yeah we'll be)
(yeah we'll be, yeah we'll be)
And we'll be fine 
(yeah we'll be, yeah we'll be)
(yeah we'll be, yeah we'll be)

Oh, we'll be fine

And we'll be fine
And we'll be fine
And we'll be fine
And we'll be fine
Just gotta try
You gotta try
And we'll be fine
And we'll be fine

And we'll be fine 
(and we'll be, and we'll be)
(and we'll be, and we'll be)
And we'll be fine 
(and we'll be, and we'll be)
(and we'll be, and we'll be)
We'll rise
And we'll be fine (yeah, we'll be)
We'll be fine (yeah, we'll be)
Yeah, we'll be fine (yeah, we'll be, yeah we'll be)
And we'll be fine (yeah, we'll be)
Yeah, we'll be fine (yeah, we'll be)
Oh, we'll be fine (yeah we'll be, yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll be)
