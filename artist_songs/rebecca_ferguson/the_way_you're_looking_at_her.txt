It's not easy to hate something you love
It's not easy to commit to giving up
Behind the smile, you face the world alone
And I thought the feelings had gone

And I've been wallowing in hollow victories
But I'd cast away my pride, take pleasure in defeat
If you'd just look at me, the way you're looking at her
If you'd just look at me, the way you're looking at her

I'm not jealous of the way you make her cry
I'm not jealous of her covering up your lies
But I remember when that foolish girl was me
And how lucky I felt to be the one that you needed

I'd forget what you did, I'd throw it in the loft
I'd step out on the bridge, and bring myself to cross
If you'd just look at me, the way you're looking at her
If you'd just look at me, the way you're looking at her

I never thought I'd say it
You're the one I thought I hated
What am I doing? Why am I waiting?
What am I waiting here for?

It's not easy to hate something you love
It's not easy to commit to giving up
But sometimes in life your heart don't know what it needs
And what's bitter seems sweet

You took the best of me, I never did escape
I know it's foolish, and I know you'll never change
Still I'm wishing you'd look at me the way you're looking at her
Wishing you'd look at me, the way you're looking at her
Wishing you'd look at me, the way you're looking at her
Her
