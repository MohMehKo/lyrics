I'll keep the grip so tight so you can't move
I told you, I warned ya
You should do just as I say but now as I do
I done told you, I warned ya

And I can do anything, anything
Anything, anything I want

Does it make you feel like you're really someone?
Does it make you feel like you can win some?
You can't take my freedom freedom freedom out of my life
Freedom freedom freedom out of my life
[x2]

I watch you live in fear of all your past
I told you, I warned ya
I'll be that whisper when you're feeling sad
I told you, I warned ya

And I can do anything, anything
Anything, anything I want

Does it make you feel like you're really someone?
Does it make you feel like you can win some?
You can't take the freedom freedom freedom out of my life
Freedom freedom freedom out of my life

Does it make you feel like you're gonna get some?
Does it make you feel like you gonna win some?
You can't take my freedom freedom freedom out of my life
You can't take the freedom

So go home
Go ahead
Go ahead and do whatever you wanna do
I don't really care
Whatever's gonna be
Do whatever you gotta do
So you can feel like you really know me

Does it make you feel like you're really someone?
Does it make you feel like you can gain some?
You can't take my freedom freedom freedom out of my life
Freedom freedom freedom out of my life

Does it make you feel like you're gonna get some?
Does it make you feel like you're gonna win some?
But you won't take the freedom freedom freedom out of my life
Freedom freedom freedom out of my life

You keep tryna take
(Freedom freedom freedom out of my life)
Boy, you keep tryna take
(Freedom freedom freedom out of my life)
