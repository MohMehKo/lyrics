One look and you had me
How'd you do that? Still can't explain
Two eyes that see me
Have I gone mad? Can't turn away
Third time lucky is what they say
I used to think that they were crazy

You're just a girl that lost her way
Another diamond outta place
Don't ask me how, don't ask me how
Don't ask me how I know now

I see it written in the stars
Written in the stars
Written in the stars
Written in the stars

Gonna kick my shoes off
And just lay here, forget about time
I never knew I wasn't living
Till you brought me to life
Showed me a world I never knew
Oh, baby, I have been waiting for you

You're just a girl that lost her way
Another diamond outta place
Don't ask me how, don't ask me how
Don't ask me how I know now

I see it written in the stars
Written in the stars
Written in the stars
Written in the stars

So light up, light up
Light up, light up, light up, light up
Light up, light up
Light up, light up, light up, light up
Light up, light up
Light up, light up, light up, light up
Light up, light up
Light up, light up, light up, light up
Light up, light up
Light up, light up, light up, light up
Light up, light up
Light up, light up, light up, light up
Light up, light up
Light up, light up, light up, light up
Light up, light up

See it written in the stars
I see us written in the stars
Light up my life, light it up
Light up my life, light it up
Light up my life
Light up, light up
Light up, light up, light up
