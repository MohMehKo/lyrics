On my, on my pride
I don't know, I don't know where we could start
The bombs they were throwing, we should've know
Something would die
I look out my window
Watching my world blown up from my eyes

I see bridges burning
Crashing down in the fire fight
The time's not turning
The war is over, we both know why
You're not coming home
You're not coming home
I'll watch these bridges burning on my own

We loved, we loved hard
But who knew that this love was bad for our hearts
Threw down our defenses, lost all our senses
Our bodies exposed
The moments of weakness slowly defeat us
Stole all our hope

I see bridges burning
Crashing down in the fire fight
The time's not turning
The war is over, we both know why
You're not coming home
You're not coming home
I'll watch these bridges burning on my own

Oh oh
You know that's clear
Oh oh
You're home and I care
Oh oh
From where I stand
I see bridges burning

I see bridges burning
Crashing down in the fire fight
The time's not turning
The war is over, we both know why
You're letting go
You're letting go
I'll watch these bridges burning on my own

I'll watch these bridges burning on my own
Bridges burning on my own
