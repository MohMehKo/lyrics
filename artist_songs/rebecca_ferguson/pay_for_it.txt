Made a connection by mistake
Tried to break it, it's already too late
If I had a penny for every heart you take
I'd have too much money, have to give it all away

Ooh 'cos your words are smooth I'm asking
Ooh troubled eyes they pull me in
You remind me of someone who don't call up anymore

Ain't it time to go now before I'm lying under you
Better not to know now what a drunken heart will do
Hold me still for a minute
Till I don't care if I don't get up again
Every time I hunger for the taste of it
In the end I know I always pay for it

There goes my honour, still I don't care
Keep me talking longer when I know I shouldn't be here
Who do I think I'm kidding, can't act like I'm a saint
I know in this trouble, but I always take the bait

Ooh 'cos your words are smooth I'm asking
Ooh troubled eyes they pull me in
You remind me of someone who don't call up anymore
You remind me of someone who don't call up anymore

Ain't it time to go now before I'm lying under you
Better not to know now what a drunken heart will do
Hold me still for a minute
Till I don't care if I don't get up again
In the end I know I always pay for it

Ain't it time to go now before I'm lying under you
Better not to know now what a drunken heart will do
Hold me still for a minute
Till I don't care if I don't get up again
Every time I hunger for the taste of it
In the end I know I always pay for it
