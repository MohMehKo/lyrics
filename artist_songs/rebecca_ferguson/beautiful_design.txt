Oooo
Yeahhh
Oooo
Yeahhh

If I gave it all up
What would I lose
If I gave my life
Gave it to you

If you could see my faults
Would you forget them all
Would you carry them all
Would you carry them all

If trust is the key
Then your love is the answer
Should I let it all go
Just believe
And let the sun shine through your mind
Let the sun shine through your mind

What a beautiful decision
What a beautiful design
When you take no love but it's given
There's no bare to hide
No bare to hide

Through all of my pain
Watched me wait on through
So I picked it all up
And gave it to you

Cause I wasn't strong
I didn't have to be
You held all my promises
All that I need

Cause trust is the key
Then your love is the answer
When you let it all go
Just believe
And let the sun shine through your mind
Let the sun shine through your mind

What a beautiful decision
What a beautiful design
When you take no love but it's given
There's no bare to hide
No bare to hide

We are golden
We'll be fine
I found the way through to you
Just give me some time

What a beautiful decision
What a beautiful design
When you take no love but it's given
There's no bare to hide
No bare to hide

What a beautiful decision
What a beautiful design
When you take no love but it's given
There's no bare to hide
No bare to hide
