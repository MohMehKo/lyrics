I got a name, I got a soul
I had a vision, but no control
The pieces were broken, so I had to go

I'm picking up what's left of me
To find myself some type of peace
Which way should I turn, cause I've got to leave

Nobody, nobody's gonna hurt me now
Nobody, nobody's gonna drag me down
I'm learning, I'm learning that I can get out

And there's more to me than makes me weak
Burning fire in my soul, longing to find home
Someone's waiting for me
And there's more to me than makes me weak
Burning fire in my soul, longing to find home
Someone's waiting, someone's waiting for me

I hear the wind change, it's calling me
Like a rhythm under my feet
Which way should I turn, cause I've got to leave

I'm running on, but I've not forgot
Don't want to be something I'm not
If my life is changing, then please set me free

Nobody, nobody's gonna hurt me now
Nobody, nobody's gonna drag me down
I'm learning, I'm learning that I can get out

And there's more to me than makes me weak
Burning fire in my soul, longing to find home
Someone's waiting for me
And there's more to me than makes me weak
Burning fire in my soul, longing to find home
Someone's waiting, someone's waiting for me

I'll be running, running, running, running on
I'll be running on

Cause there's more to me than makes me weak
Burning fire in my soul, longing to find home
Someone's waiting for me
And there's more to me than makes me weak
A burning fire in my soul and longing to find home
Someone's waiting, yeah, for me, for me
A burning fire in my soul, longing to find home
Someone is waiting for
Waiting for me
