Hey Mr. Bright Eyes
Where you been all of my life?
I've been daydreaming 'bout you
I cannot deny what feels so true

Am I serious? Maybe it's true
Can't believe that I just let myself go
Is it obvious? Should I had the clues?
Got Cupid-shot and I'm not gonna lose
But I don't seem to care about what they say
All I really wanna do is think about you all day
And all these feelings that I have
Have got me falling so bad

Hey Mr. Bright Eyes
Where you been all of my life?
I've been daydreaming 'bout you
I cannot deny what feels so true

Here I am just laying up in my room
All day long all I think 'bout you
Ooh get butterflies whenever I go next to you
Got Cupid-shot and I ain't ever gonna lose
But I don't seem to care about what they say
All I really wanna do is think about you all day
And all these feelings that I have
Have got me falling so bad

Hey Mr. Bright Eyes
Where you been all of my life?
I've been daydreaming 'bout you
I cannot deny what feels so true

People say I'm a fool
For loving you,
Need to find something better to do
But what they don't realize
Is every time you come near I get butterflies

Hey Mr. Bright Eyes
Where you been all of my life?
I've been daydreaming 'bout you
I cannot deny what feels so true

Hey Mr. Bright Eyes
Where you been all of my life?
I've been daydreaming 'bout you
I cannot deny what feels so true
Mr. Bright Eyes
Oh, Mr. Bright Eyes
