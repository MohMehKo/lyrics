I know you've been 
Hurt by someone else 
I can tell by the way 
You carry yourself 

But if you let me 
Here's what I'll do 
I'll take care of you 

I, I've loved and lost 
The same as you 
So you see I know 
Just what you've been through 

But if you'll let me 
Here's what I'll do 
I just got to take care of you 

You won't ever have to worry 
You won't ever have to cry 
I'll be there beside you 
To dry your weeping eyes 

So, darling, tell me 
That you'll be true 
For there is no 
Doubt in my mind 
I know what I want to do 

And just as sure 
As one and one is two, woah 
You know I'll take care of you 
I'll take care of you
