What rules you makes you happy
But your love will be your guide
What you desire
Becomes your fire
To keep you burning
Constant yearning
When I decide
To leave my pride

I choose you
I choose happiness
I choose being myself
Despite everything else
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you

I can make new plans
Leave this strange land
So I can be near you
So my love can feel you
Don't want no confusion
Want you to know
I'm always here
You're worth the weight in gold
Despite the lies I told

[x2]
I choose you
I choose happiness
I choose being myself
Despite everything else

I choose you
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you

And I been trying, boy
It seems like I no longer cared
Dreams don't last forever baby
But my pride is gone
My pride is gone

[x3]
I choose you
I choose happiness
I choose being myself
Despite everything else

[x2]
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you

Cause I've been trying hard
Though it seems I no longer cared
I choose you, you
You, I choose you
