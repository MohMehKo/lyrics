There is hope
Even as the tears fall on your lips
Even as you take another sip
And cough from all you smoked the night before
Didn't lose the war
So stand back up and be a man
Hold yourself complete again
And say the words:

I am free, I am free
It's the sound of peace

There is laughs
Even when all you got is a box of frowns
They gave you as they held you to the ground

But over the hills call out sounds
Spill out break heavy ground
Angels dress they dance around
You can hear it, you can feel it
The psalm says:

I am free, I am free
It's the sound of peace
Yeah, I am free, I am free
It's the sound of peace

And it's freedom, sweet freedom
I was so down
They held me to the ground
But now I'm free now
I'm free now

But now I'm free
But now I'm free

There is hope
Even as the tears fall on my lips
Even as I take another sip
And cough from all I've smoked the night before
I didn't lose the war
I'll stand back up and be the man
Hold myself complete again
And say the words:

I am free, I am free
It's the sound of peace
