Isn’t it amazing what a lonely heart will have you do
Just when you think you’re getting wiser
Somebody comes along, and you’re stuck like glue
Isn’t it amazing what a lonely heart will have you do

He lays my flaws before me
He says I’m blind I can’t see
He makes me feel unworthy
Shapes the rules, I’m a fool if I take the lead

But tell me someone who never lied to themselves
Who never ran through hell, just to find love
Just to hold love
And it wasn’t enough, it’s amazing
So amazing

Fighting suspicions, lady's intuitions
Why, I don’t need it, cause it’s not what I want to hear
So I put you on my altar, crown you like a sultan
And praise you for every lie that drips from your lips
[x2]

What would you do, what would you do?
What would you do?
Wasn’t enough, it’s amazing
So amazing,

Fighting suspicions, lady's intuitions
Why, I don’t need it, cause it’s not what I want to hear
So I put you on my altar, crown you like a sultan
And praise you for every lie that drips from your lips

And he pulls you down, he pulls you down...

Isn’t it amazing what a lonely heart will have you do
Cause when you think you’re getting wiser
Somebody comes along and you’re stuck like glue
Isn’t it amazing what my lonely heart will have me do.
