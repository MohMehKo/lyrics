Nameless faces
Changeless places
Oh, I've known them all
Mass confusion
No illusion
Just waiting for the sky to fall

But when you keep on moving
Refuse to give in
Don't let the dogs see you down
Stand united
Yes, we're fighting
They'll hear us shaking the ground

Because the love that keeps us strong
Goes deeper, goes deeper, than oceans
Because the love that keeps us strong
Goes deeper, goes deeper, than oceans

Picking up our feet
Racing ahead
So many lines have been crossed
The tears we've cried
The blood we bled
But every drop has a cost

But let us keep on pouring
As our hearts keep roaring
Our strength will never run out
Stand united
Yes, we're fighting
They'll hear us shaking the ground

Because the love that keeps us strong
Goes deeper, goes deeper, than oceans
Because the love that keeps us strong
Goes deeper, goes deeper, than oceans

They will hear us roar
They will hear us roar
They will hear us roar
They will hear us roar

Because the love that keeps us strong
Goes deeper, goes deeper, than oceans
Because the love that keeps us strong
Goes deeper, goes deeper, than oceans

Goes deeper, goes deeper, than oceans
Goes deeper, goes deeper, than oceans
