Hush now, don't explain
Just say you'll remain
I'm glad that you're back
Don't explain

Quiet baby, don't explain
What is there to gain
Skip that lipstick
Don't explain

You know that I love you
And what love endures
All my thoughts are of you
For I'm so completely yours
Cry to hear folks chatter
And I know you cheat
Right or wrong, don't matter
When you're with me, my sweet

Hush now, don't explain
You're my joy and pain
My life's yours, 
Don't explain

You know that I love you
And what love endures
All my thoughts are of you
And I'm so completely yours
Go out know
Cause I know you cheat
Right or wrong, don't matter
Just you're with me, sweet
don't explain
Cause you're my joy and you're my pain
My life's yours,
Don't explain
