Them that's got shall have
Them that's not shall lose
So the Bible says and it still is news
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own, that's got his own

Money, you've got lots of friends
They're crowding around your door
But when you're gone and spending ends
They won't come to you no more

Rich relations give crusts of bread and such
You can help yourself, just don't take too much
Cause Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own, that's got his own

Money, you've got lots of friends
They're crowding around your door
But when you're gone and spending ends
They won't come to you no more

So the strong get smart
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade
But God bless the child, God bless the child
God bless the child, God bless the child...
