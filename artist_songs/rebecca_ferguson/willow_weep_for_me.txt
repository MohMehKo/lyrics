Willow weep for me
Willow weep for me
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
Listen to my plea
Hear me willow and weep for me

Gone my lovely dreams
Lovely summer dreams
Gone and left me here
To weep my tears along the stream
Sad as I can be
Hear me willow and weep for me

Whisper to the wind
And say they love has sinned
To leave my heart sighing crying all alone
Murmur to the night
Hide her starry light
So none will find me sighing
Crying all alone

Weeping willow tree
Weeping sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground
And cover me
Listen to my plea
Hear me willow and weep for me
weep for me
weep for me
Willow weep for me
Willow weep for me
