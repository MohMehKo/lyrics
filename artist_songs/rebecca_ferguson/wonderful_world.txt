I act like it's not cold, it's warm
Take back my curtains that have been drawn
Pretend all my bills have been paid
They've been okay for days

I smile through the door
Don't worry about any storm
Not everyone will love me
But I'm not scared to try

And I dream of a better life
And I'll find what makes me smile
I'm not there but give me time
Plant a seed and let it flower through my hurt
Found a good worth day and I'm digging through my dirt
And I'm watching as the colors light the earth
Thinkin what a wonderful world
Yea, thinkin what a wonderful world

Scrape back my hair, that's all messy
Wipe mascara from my eyes
Put on my brave face
The kind that tells I'm alright

I laugh when they're not near
'Cause I know the truth
Not everyone will love me
But I'm not scared to try

[x2]
'Cause I dream of a better life
And I'll find what makes me smile
I'm not there but give me time
Plant a seed and let it flower through my hurt
Found a good worth day and I'm digging through my dirt
And I'm watching as the colors light the earth
Thinkin what a wonderful world
Yea, thinkin what a wonderful world

I'm in a wonderful world
