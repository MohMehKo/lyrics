All of me, why not take all of me?
Can't you see I'm no good without you?
Take my lips I want to lose them
Take my arms I'll never use them

Your goodbyes left me with eyes that cry
How can I go along without you
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?

All of me, why not take all of me?
Can't you see I'm no good without you?
Take my lips I want to lose them
Take my arms I'll never use them

Your goodbyes left me with eyes that cry
How can I go along without you
You took the best, so I'm not take the rest
So baby take all of me?
