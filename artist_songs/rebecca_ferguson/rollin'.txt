[Verse 1:]
I'm just a woman who does everything she can
Always been there, looking after her man.
I wash away your dishes, put them in their place.
Sacrifice my life to raise the kids we made.

[Chorus:]
So when you're sad just hold her hand and think of me
And when the sun has had her way, dried all you can see
When you realize it's all built on lies don't come running back to me
Cause I'll be gone, like the rolling sea.

[Verse 2:]
I compare myself as I look upon my scars,
The ones that you held babe as I was carrying your child's weight
Try and wash away all my flaws
But what difference does it make?

[Chorus:]
So when you're sad just hold her hand and think of me
And when the sun has had her way, dried all we can see
When you realize it's all built on lies don't come running back to me
Cause I'll be gone, I'll be gone, like the rolling sea.

Just like the rolling sea.

[Chorus:]
So when you're sad just hold her hand and think of me
Just when the sun has had her way, dried all we can see
When you realize it's all built on lies don't come running, running back to me
Cause I'll be gone, I'll be gone
Like the rolling sea.
