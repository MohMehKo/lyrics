It cost me a lot,
But there's one thing that I've got, it's my man
Cold and wet, tired, you bet,
all of that I forget with my man

He's not much for looks
And no hero out of books is my man
Two or three girls has he
That he likes as well as me, but I love him...

I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true, he beats me do

Oh, my man, I love him so, he'll never know
All my life is just despair, I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright, and it's all right

What's the difference if I say I'll go away
When I'll come back on my knee someday
Whatever my man is, I am his forever more
