Hello Miss Cold
I came by to give you the season
A hot day you're going to pay
Don't you know you're wanted for treason
Oh no, why is it so?
You have always been so freezin'
To me you couldn't see I only wanted to be just pleasin'

And after all this time you're next to me'
You still turn me around
And I can let my destination be here right now
Breaking up your ice you'll see
Burn it all down
And when my sun comes out it's destiny
I'll be warming up your frozen ground.

Hello Miss Cold
I got my lemons and I'm ready for squeezing
One way you're going to stay
Ain't no time left for you to reason
Oh grace you're out in space
You've already started your wheezing
Today you'll be saved
I'm going to stop all of your bleeding

And after all this time you're next to me
You still turn me around
And I can let my destination be here right now
Breaking up your ice you'll see
Burn it all down
And when my sun comes out it's destiny
I'll be warming up your frozen ground
