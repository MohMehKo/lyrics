People
This is what I say tonight
Messed up
After that I'm much too bright
You all just sit here smiling and I
Cannot control myself when I know I'm right
Oh and I can't help you tonight

Here it comes
Falling down on your face
Sometimes I just feel you're out of place

Hey George
I think I can help you now
Remember
You brought this upon yourself
You all just sit here smiling and I
Cannot control myself when I know I'm right
Oh and I can't help you tonight

Here it comes
Falling down on your face
Sometimes I just feel you're out of place
You always end up with egg on your face

You all just sit here smiling hey
You all just sit here smiling hey
You all just sit here smiling hey
You all just sit here smiling

Hey George
I think I can help you now
