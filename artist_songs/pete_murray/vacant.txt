Burning down,
Trying to understand.
Watching all your moves, 
Hoping to read your hand.
But I've been vacant here for days,
Like I'm for sale, 
I'm for sale, I'm for sale, I'm for sale.

I miss you so,
Breaks my world in two.
And now I find myself,
In such a lonely queue.
And I'm not waiting here in time,
Just to fail,
Please don't fail, please don't fail, please don't fail.

Hard times, 
My heart is tied to you.
Keeps me broken, blind,
Your inner sun is true.
Such a hard time, 
Now my world is missing you,
It's missing everything,
That you are, that you are, that you are.

And I'm not waiting here in time,
Just to fail,
Please don't fail, please don't fail, please don't fail.

Hard times, 
My heart is tied to you.
Keeps me broken, blind,
Your inner sun is true.
Such a hard time, 
Now my world is missing you.
It's missing everything,
That you are, that you are, that you are.
