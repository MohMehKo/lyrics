And if I could
Surely would today
And if I knew
All the words to say
And I could
Wisp you away
To my world

But you might say, it's just the luck of the draw
You might say, that you've done this before
You might feel, that you're ten ft tall some days

And all I ever wanted to be
Will remain right here with you, and me,
And the times we've had, and the times we're yet to see
You and me and the things we've done
And i'm sure it's meant to be

Do you.....Do you.....Do you......Do you agree?

You fought it well
And you fought it all away
What you learn in school, 
You learn, you can lose in a day
Many stand for you
They will stand today

But you might say, it's just the luck of the draw
You might say, that you've done this before
You might feel, that you're ten ft tall some days

And all I ever wanted to be
Will remain right here, with you, and me,
And the times we've had, and the times we're yet to see
You and me and the things we've done
And i'm sure it's meant to be

Do you.....Do you.....Do you.....Do you agree? [Repeat 4x]
