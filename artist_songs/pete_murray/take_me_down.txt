Got my bags packed
Rocket chief says
Guess I'm flying to the moon and back

Yes it's true
Always want more time with you
Take me bound take me tight
Hold me one more time before this night is through
Thank God I'm more than friends with you

So take me down
To where it all began
And let yourself come over me
With all the love that you have
Let me know
Can we stay just one more day
In this moment that we've saved
So we don't let this time away

Took a walk
Bird in hand
Caught your eye with one more glance
Then I knew
My happiness belongs to you

So take me down
To where it all began
And let yourself come over me
With all the love that you have
Let me know
Can we stay just one more day
In this moment that we've saved
So we don't let this time away

Ooh ooh just hold on
Before the time we have is gone

So take me down
To where it all began
And let yourself come over me
With all the love that you have
Let me know
Can we stay just one more day
In this moment that we've saved
So we don't let this time away

Take me down
To where it all began
And let yourself come over me
With all the love that you have
Let me know
Can we stay just one more day
In this moment that we've saved
So we don't let this time away

Ooh ooh just hold on
