It's been four long years gone by now
Can see the shape I'm in
Rest assured I'm on my way
How'd you get me to the place I been
Only you know it's always faith
Now all my faith's in a spin
As I'm almost on my way
Now please take me right in

Because every word has been a moment in time
You're like a poem that's caught in my head
I curse the day when I'll see that lonely smile
But it's better than playin' pretend
And I know, yes I know
That I have to let you go
Let you go,
Let you go, just like I want you to stay
Let you go, let you go
Let you go, just like I want you to stay

It's the time now, it's all there
It's way out, that's been wearin' me thin
I stop right now and say bye to all this
And take it right on the chin
Only you know that when your faith's out
A new faith will begin
As the darkness slowly fades now
Come let the light in

Because every word has been a moment in time
You're like a poem that's caught in my head
I curse the day when I'll see that lonely smile
But it's better than playin' pretend
And I know, yes I know
That I have to let you go
Let you go,
Let you go, just like I want you to stay
Let you go, let you go
Let you go, just like I want you to stay

Because every word has been a moment in time
You're like a poem that's caught in my head
I curse the day when I'll see that lonely smile
But it's better than playin' pretend
And I know, yes I know
That I have to let you go
Let you go,
Let you go, just like I want you to stay
Let you go, let you go
Let you go, just like I want you to stay
