Hey, see it my way 
If we all had a dream 
We could bust this place 
And we could take it down 
Like a run away train 
I bet you'd make me smile 
Like I'm going insane 
So pick your style 
And pick your place 
And we can burn like the summer 
With amazing grace 
Gonna win now 
Cause I know you are 
You are my one true love 
And you got me this far 

[Chorus:]
Always a winner, yeah your always a winner for me 
Always a winner, yeah your always a winner for me 

With my best friend 
I put my best foot forward 
Gonna dry you out like a winter time wind 
And I wont stop now no I keep coming 
Better knock me down sober so I can't get up 
This time will see the last time 
Oh your always a winner 
Don't you burn yourself out 

[Chorus:]
Always a winner, yeah your always a winner for me 
Always a winner, yeah your always a winner for me 

Pick me up don't bring me down 
Take me right now to the other side of town 
That's where I wanna be, you and me alone 
We've gotta build it right up so we can make it our home 
Beauty man, there ain't no beauty man seen 
I'm gonna break it right now 
Your a winner to me 

[Chorus:]
Always a winner, yeah your always a winner for me 
Always a winner, yeah your always a winner for me 
Always a winner, yeah your always a winner for me 
Always a winner, yeah your always a winner for me
