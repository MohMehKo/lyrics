Babe you make me own my day
You make me feel a lifetime
You take me all the way
You've been my one true lifeline
Makes me wanna stay
You've put true faith in my mind
You stand me tall and safe
I want you here, in my life

Cause you've given it everything 
Colors all
No more blue and gray
Air is cold
But you're burning up my love
Just to bring me 'round

Please led me breathe slowly
And you make me walk in time
I see my future clearly

Cause you've given it everything 
Colors all
No more blue and gray
Air is cold
But you're burning up my love
Just to bring me 'round

Please led me breathe slowly
Yeah you know I'll always led you fly
Babe babe I'm gonna take your led way

Cause you've given it everything 
Colors all
No more blue and gray
Air is cold
But you're burning up my love
Just to bring me 'round

And all the led is gone
All the led is gone
All the led is gone

Babe you know I'll always led you fly
Babe babe I'm gonna take your led way
