Can you tell me when
Are you going to realise
That you can depend
On you instincts or your allabies
Do you play by the rules
Of these games being led by so many fools
You ignore the system that were in
Cause you believe your to good to commit sin

When you notice its only in your head
When you could justify yourself 
To your friends they'll help you when you fall
Cause my friend your about to hit the floor
Your falling your way down to the floor

Can you tell me when
You lie into your girlfriends eyes
Does your blood run through your thighs
Instead of drilling pins and needles up your spine

When you notice its only in your head
When you could justify yourself 
To your friends they'll help you when you fall
Cause my friend your about to hit the floor
Your falling your way down to the floor

Cant you see the mess your in
Cant you see the mess your in
Cant you see the mess your in
Dont you care dont care at all
Dont you care at all

Your so into your own life
That you dont care who else is in strife
When your friends all wanna come along
Then you realise what the hell went wrong

When you notice its only in your head
When you could justify yourself 
To your friends they'll help you when you fall
Cause my friend your about to hit the floor
Your falling your way down to the floor
