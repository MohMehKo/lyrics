For always I'll see you there
For always I'll hold your hand
For always be your man

Please say something I want you to add
To this morning I have to go and
All is nothing without you.. without you.. without you. without you

For always I'll see you there
For always I'll hold your hand
For always be your man
Be your man [x5]

Please say something I want you to add
To this morning I have to go and
All is nothing without you... Without you... Without you. Without you

Please... please... please... say something
