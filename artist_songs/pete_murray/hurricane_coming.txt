A knight came down from a distant land
To stop a valentine sorceress to reign
The country 'round was dying down
And the people lived in fear of her name

The knight and the sorceress were lovers once
The knight still shows scars of his pain
He said that the wild wind that is approaching now
Will ring upon your ears your name

And you gotta know, I'm gonna break your reign
Down you'll go, just like a burning flame

Cause a real loud hurricane is coming now
It's gonna pick you up and spin you like rain
How I'll miss you so but I'll cut you down
If you ever come back here again.

The sorceress gazed into her crystal ball
She saw the knight ridin' right into her aim
Sending her demons way up into the sky
Towards the knight they all came

Well the knight rode on with his sword raised high,
One by one he conquered his prey;
He glared back and caught the eye of his enemy, he said:
I warned you once you would see this day.

And you gotta know, I'm gonna break your reign
Down you'll go, just like a burning flame

Cause a real loud hurricane is coming now
It's gonna pick you up and spin you like rain
How I'll miss you so but I'll cut you down
If you ever come back here again.

And you gotta know, I'm gonna break your reign
Down you'll go, just like a burning flame
You gotta know, I'm gonna break your reign
Down you'll go, just like a burning flame

Cause a real loud hurricane is coming now
It's gonna pick you up and spin you like rain
How I'll miss you so but I'll cut you down
If you ever come back here again.
If you ever come back here again.
If you ever come back here again.
If you ever come back here again.
Don't you ever come back here again.
