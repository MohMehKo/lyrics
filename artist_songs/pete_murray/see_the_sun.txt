Where's a word
That we learn to know
And where's a word
That we should go

Can you be the one
Can you see the sun
With me

Hate's a word
That we learn to use
And vain's a sign
That is old and abused

Can you be the one
Can you see the sun
With me

I'm here and I'm never gone
I'm here and I'm never gone
I'm here and I'm never gone
I'm here and I'm never gone

Can you be the one
Can you see the sun
With me
With me
With me
With me
With me
