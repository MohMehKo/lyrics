Sometimes I watch my life
And it slowly goes
From black then into white
I know if you
Watch the time
Leaves you standing poring over moments in life

I know I've been through black and white
I know I'll put up a fierce fight
I know I lost my soul
I know that I lost my soul

So I wait to sieze the day
The clouded mind
The hell I've a lot to pay
I find that if you know
Your way you get out of this mess

I know I've been through black and white
I know I'll put up a fierce fight
I know I lost my soul
I know that I lost my soul

I know there comes a time
To believe in yourself
And grow in confidence
Stop hiding behind the door
Like everyone else
Just get out and do your best

I know I've been through black and white
I know I'll put up a fierce fight
I know I lost my soul
I know that I lost my soul
I know that I'll find my soul
