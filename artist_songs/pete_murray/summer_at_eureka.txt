Baby I've been a fool on time
But it's always been in my way
And I don't know or understand it now
So darlin' summer's almost gone
And I've been cold and along my way everyday
I'm calling out in overload

Just to save you for it's the only time we know
Yesterday is so far and I can only begin to say

I've been winging it here
But time's just a killing my day
Yearning for to touch your ways
Now any time you feel it inside
Don't be lonely in your sleep
Dream me there cause it will always keep us bound

It's the same old laws that we learned on yesterday
It's your way I'm calling out
And how god has blessed me
How long this time will have our way
Just the same spring is gone and your summer's on its way

Feel it now
Don't worry what's going down
'Cause everything we ever had is always here
