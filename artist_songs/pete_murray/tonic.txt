See your face, just the other day
Takes me back, to the other place
When I feel, it's not to far away
And I just wanna' hold your hand, and walk with you,
On another day

I......want you
To sit on my lap,
And do the sweet things that we used to

At the place, just the other day
And I ordered a drink, the tonics on it's way
When I feel, it's not to far away
And I just wanna' hold your hand, and walk with you,

On another day

I......want you
To sit on my lap,
And do the sweet things that we used to
I......love you
So come on girl,
Lets do the sweet things that we used to

[Repeat 2x]
