I wanna take this day
I wanna hold it right out next to you
So you can see it's perfect way
You know there's nothing I'd change of you

So you can take me as I am
Or you can watch me burn right next to you
Don't you know or understand
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you

I wanna be the one to know you
Hold you right under my skin
I wanna be the one to love you
Never let the end begin

I wanna take your face
I wanna picture it in a frame for you
So you can see it's perfect grace
You know there's nothing to better you

I wanna be the one to know you
Hold you right under my skin
I wanna be the one to love you
Never let the end begin

Hope you can see it in the end
Hope you can sing yourself another tune
Come on and let yourself begin
'Cause I've been waiting here right next to you

I wanna be the one to know you
Hold you right under my skin
I wanna be the one to love you
Never let the end begin

I wanna be the one to know you
Hold you right under my skin
I wanna be the one to love you
Never let the end begin
