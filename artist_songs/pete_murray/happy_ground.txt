Happy days are coming my way, its been some time, but here to stay,
Is the life of love Ive found, sends me up on happy ground.
Sleepy head has gone to bed, makes me laugh, face turn red,
Giggling down on the ground, I'll pick you up and spin you around.

Happy now, happy now, happy now I'm on happy ground. [x2]

Drive to town, wearing a frown, go wash it off you silly old clown,
Look at the day, it's going away, don't worry about another say.

Happy now, happy now, happy now I'm on happy ground. [x2]

Simple days are slipping away, times go fast, I'm turning gray,
Ive got my love and family too, nothing I'd change, I'm cruel.

Happy now, happy now, happy now I'm on happy ground [x14]
