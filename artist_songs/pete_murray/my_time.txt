Look at the time its on my life slowly ticking away
Dead to my mind
Try to ride the bike but i'll never learn 
Should've known better
Shouldn't be so concerned

Sittin' alone in my room wasting my time 
Just waiting for the news that could free me
Get me out of this mess i should i have never thought
I could be so blessed

Wasting my time watch my life
Slip away
Wasting my time watch my life
Slip away

Should've known the different between right and wrong
Shouldn't sit around throwing stones
Gotta find my stage and act so kind
I wonna lose myself on my piece of mind

Wasting my time watch my life
Slip away
Wasting my time watch my life
Slip away

I wish that you were here to teach me
I wish that you were here to speak to me

No more sittin' alone in my room wasting my time
Just waiting for the news that could free me
Get me out of this mess i should have never thought
Only think i am blessed

Wasting my time watch my life
Slip away
Wasting my time watch my life
Slip away
Wasting my time watch my life
Slip away
Wasting my time watch my life
Slip away
