Broken down I faded, my heart’s in disarray
I burn to have you rescued from black times today
All this waiting will not break me down
And your silence only makes my sound, my sound

We’ve held enough to know that we’re buried in our fate
I’m gonna carry you somehow if it’s bustin’ all my veins
I’m gonna bleed with you right now if we goin’ to stop the fall
Have you seen nothing at all

Turn around I’m chasing this life and get away
Look right down upon me now to help me through this day
All this waiting will not break me down
And your silence only makes my sound, my sound

We’ve held enough to know that we’re buried in our fate
I’m gonna carry you somehow if it’s bustin’ all my veins
I’m gonna bleed with you right now if we goin’ to stop the fall
Have you seen nothing at all
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

All this waiting will not break me down
And your silence only makes my sound, my sound

We’ve held enough to know that we’re buried in our fate
I’m gonna carry you somehow if it’s bustin’ all my veins
I’m gonna bleed with you right now if we goin’ to stop the fall
Have you seen nothing at all
Have you seen nothing at all
Have you seen nothing at all
