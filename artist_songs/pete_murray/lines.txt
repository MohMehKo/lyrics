Passin' time
You've come so far but you're still behind,
Lose you mind,
If you cut this line
It's just the way it's been,
All your friends and all their sins,
Just passin' time,
(Don't fall behind)

I will come for you
If you call I'll come right now
I will help you see through
All your pain and trouble times
Just you know I'll be there
If you ever decide to call,

Passin' time
All you're addictions are so sublime
Lose you're mind,
If you cross the line
It's just the way it's been,
All your friends and all their sins,

Just passin' time,
(Don't fall behind)

I will come for you
If you call I'll come right now
I will help you see through
All your pain and trouble times
Just you know I'll be there
If you ever decide to call,

I'll be there for you
If you ever call,
I'll be there for you
Any time at all,

Passin' time,
Just passin' time
Passin' time,
Just passin' time

Passin' time
(Come so far)
Just passin' time
(Come so far)
Passin time
(Come so far)
Just passin time
