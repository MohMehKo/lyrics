Two years
And I feel like I'm over this pill
Is the reason I wonder and still
You just light up the way
I burn
Like the sunsets above me, two feet
My eyes are so tired I can't sleep
And it's only a day

And all of this heart is waiting for you
And all of this mind falls apart for you

Two years
And I feel like I'm over this pill
Is the reason I wonder and still
You just light up the way
Your soul
Seems to guide like a bird and still
Even though with no word, I will
Hold a place for your love

And all of this heart is waiting for you
And all of this mind falls apart for you
