Wake soon, with a fear swirling in your eyes
Everlasting, calm down
And it appears as no surprise
That you wait in silent tears
For all your ship to sail away
And you're burning like the sun, don't move
As it changes the course of your day

But you hold it all for love until it's gone
Like a mother and a child before life takes it's home
Yes you hold it all for love until it's gone

These days got you flyin'
Up so high you gotta hope for your chance
Wait to dig deep in line
And then you'll steal your place in advance
And I beg, I beg you please
Don't let it go if you could still have [?]
Cause your time is here and now
We all know you're worth it

Cause you hold it all for love until it's gone
Like a mother and a child before life takes it's home
Yes you'll hold it all for love until it's gone

I beg, I beg you please
It's your world and what you're needing
I beg, I beg you please
It's your time now, don't you lose it

I beg, I beg you please
It's your world and what you're needing
I beg, I beg you please
It's your time, don't you lose it

You'll hold all for love until it's gone
Yes, you'll hold it all for love until it's gone
Yes, you'll hold it all for love until it's gone
Yeah, you'll hold it all for love until it's gone
