I got you, you know I heard you say
You blossomed into a beautiful day
Your sunlight keeps shining in my face
I would see it even in deep out of space

And all in time, I know
I will see you again and again
And every night I'm going to hold you
And hold you and then

Before the light I will rescue
And then we'll begin to start it all over again

I love it and how you clear my way
Guide me into a brand new day
In your eyes you know I've found my place
You see you - you are my saving grace

And all in time
I going to see you again and again
And every night I'm going
To hold you and hold you and then

Before the light I will rescue
And then we'll begin to start it all over again

Don't ever want to miss you
Don't ever want to forget you
The way you are today

And all in time
I'm going see you again and again
And every night I'm going
To hold you and hold you and then

Before the light I will rescue
And then we'll begin to start it all over again
