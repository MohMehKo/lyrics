Yesterday young and free
Your first kiss
You gave it all to me
Now I'm holding all my gold for free
Sudden dream a small thing
Makes me laugh and it makes me sing
Never knew what this love would bring
Now you have turned all my winters spring

Now I'm changing all my loneliness
I'm changing it all for happiness
And I can feel this emptiness slowly fade away

Just one look in your eyes
My best friend
You just make me fly
And I never want to end this flight

Now I'm - I'm riding on my own king tide [x2]
