I don't know
That the plans that I have to save
My security
Has never been enough for me
You must have been heaven sent
You showed me there's more than paying the rent

I've been passing hours of my days
Selling books and things
I've missed many years of my life
Having securities

And I don't know
What is right or wrong
Sometimes I feel
I'd be better off without this home
And it's a hell of a waste when you're gone
Hording all your things for so long

I've been passing hours of my days
Selling books and things
I've missed many years of my life
Having securities
Yeah

Sometimes I know
That I have been told
That I need a second job
So I can grow old
But I haven't lived my life yet
And I've never been out of this set

I've been passing hours of my days
Selling books and things
I've missed many years of my life
Having securities

I've been passing hours of my days
Selling books and things
I've missed many years of my life
Having securities
Yeah
