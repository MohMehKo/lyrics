Forbidden love bleeding on my mind
Brings me to my knees
With the taste of your sweet wine
Oh
Only if you could fade

Lead me to the sea
And always catch your tide
I count the seconds will you're free
Then tell myself one more time
Oh
Only if you could fade

Sugar your taste is fine
But you're far above
This day - when I make you mine
We'll be free

Lay lady please
Lay next to me
Tell me all my love
Is all that you need

Oh
Only if you could fade

Sugar your taste is fine
But you're far above
This day - when I make you mine
We'll be free

Oh
I know only if you could fade

Sugar well your taste is fine
But you're far above
This day - when I make you mine
We'll be free
