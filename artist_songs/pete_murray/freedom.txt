Freedom, comes my way some times
But I have got no place to go
Freedom, has it's own silence
But I can hear no more

I've got no time
For lies that bring me down
And I must be wise
Before I vote you there

Freedom goes around in circles
But I just go straight on

Freedom comes to those deserving
But I fail to comply

I've got no time
For lies that bring me down
And I must be wise
Before I vote you there

Freedom, freedom, freedom
Comes my way sometimes
But I got no place to go
