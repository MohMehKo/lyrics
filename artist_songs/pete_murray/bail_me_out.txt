Two weeks away from reality
And I was beginning to feel,
I couldn't be myself,
I feel like a fly caught in honey,
Knowing that soon
Somebody was going to see me
Knowing that I probably going to die

Oh here we go again I'm so spent
My head is spinning
Oh can you bail me out of this rut
I've got myself in once again

From the nightmares and my dreams
I was beginning to feel,

I couldn't be myself
She was a little girl,
She knew all about my world
She was the legend on my dreams
She could set me free

Oh here we go again I'm so spent
My head is spinning
Oh can you bail me out of this rut
I've got myself in once again

Oh here we go again I'm so spent
My head is spinning
Oh can you bail me out of this rut
I've got myself in once again
