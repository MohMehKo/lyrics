Watch her learn your ways
Let her eyes steal your soul today
And in despair she will come and save
From the black, from the black

I've gotta tie my wound to save myself
Gotta hold on tight, do nothing else
You stain so much, I'm tattooed by your love

Jealousy's not playin'
She makes you feel
Your world's full of prayin'
And on a hike is where you will be stayin'
No come down, no come down

I've gotta tie my wound to save myself
Gotta hold on tight, do nothing else
You stain so much, I'm tattooed by your love
[x2]

I've gotta tie my wound to save myself
Gotta hold on tight, do nothing else
You stain so much, I'm tattooed by your love
[x2]

Love, love...
