Well you broke me with your smile
And I'm captured now
Like I've just drank a thousand year potion
Mix your tears into my wine
Please hold my life
And let me know when you are back open

Please embrace my soul
While you find your way
However far you roam
In my heart you'll stay

Well you burn me with your fire
Any faults you had were always hidden by your sweet devotion
Lord I hope you know I'm trying
These dark old clouds still cover me with doubts every moment

Please embrace my soul
While you find your way
However far you roam
In my heart you'll stay

Please embrace my soul
While you find your way
However far you roam
In my heart you'll stay

Please embrace my soul
While you find your way
However far you roam
In my heart you'll stay

You'll stay
