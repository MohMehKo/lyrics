You taught me life
You taught me peace
You brought me down with no disgrace
You showed me love
Was what I need
Now in a different place
On a different speed

I miss our time
I miss your way
I miss everything we say
I'd give it all for that time and place
Just to say goodbye to your face

You made me once
You made me twice
If I could have saved you
I'd have paid any price
You led me through such a killer race
You helped me fly with all your grace

I miss your time
I miss your way
I miss everything we saved
I'd give it all for that time and place
Just to say goodbye to your face

Is there anyway [x2]
I could talk to you for one more day

Is there anyway [x2]
I could say goodbye for one more day

I miss our time
I miss your way
I miss everything we've saved
I'd give it all for that time and place
Just to say goodbye to your face
