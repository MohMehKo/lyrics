You saved me
Like you saw my old me
Passion now flowing in my veins
Breathless days
I'd sit alone in silence
You brought me sun
And took away the rain

Honestly it's not a phase
Now I stand
Where before I couldn't raise
Even a smile just to get me through the days

You pick me up
You pick me up

You took me
Set my world on fire
Red stop light, you won't let see green
No mistakes
You march on your like you're wired
You lift me up
To the greatest that I've been

Honestly it's not a phase
Now I stand
Where before I couldn't raise
Even a smile just to get me through the days

You pick me up
You pick me up

You pick me up
Making me fire
Do you even know how much you've saved

Take me now
I have what I wanted
Bonfire, in my woman's eye
Thank you hell
You've been more than I needed
There's no black cloud
There is no black at all

Honestly it's not a phase
Now I stand
Where before I couldn't raise
Even a smile just to get me through the day

You pick me up
You pick me up
