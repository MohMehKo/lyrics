He puts his hand down into his pocket
Pulls out a rose and hands it to his girl
She says, hey man (what you doin') (what you sayin')
No, I thought i told you
I don't want you here no more
So go get out of here so I don't see your face
Your the one who used to beat me to love you
And I don't want you back again

No more........No more.......No more

Many times you swing that hand
But did you ever see the bruise you used to leave
I'd spend days, I could not go out,
Sometimes it would be weeks
So don't come back thinking i'm okay
Cause really man, I hate you to the core
You're the most gutless thing i've ever known,
Or ever saw

No more.......No more.......No more

(You can't hide the scars)
(You can't hide the scars)

So turn around and just start walking
Cause we got, nothing left to say
When you're gone, you can be assured
My smile, is gonna' come back my way
And i'll wipe you from my memory
So you don't exist in my day
But just remember i'll still smell you,
A thousand miles away

No more.......No more.......No more
