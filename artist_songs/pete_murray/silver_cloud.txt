I feel sometimes you're a sinking stone, now.
No way up, and there's no way home.
When all your days are falling down now,
There's no one thing, I'm here.

[CHORUS]
When I hear you calling out
I pick you up when you're falling down,
I place you gentle on a silver cloud
Love my way, it's another world for you!

My arms I wave
And I take you in now
Break this spell and remove your sins
When all time stalls you soon will see
how this cannot fail now you're here

[CHORUS x2]

For you now,
For you.
