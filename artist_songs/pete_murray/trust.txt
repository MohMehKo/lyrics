I sit so alone in a room
Bright light on my face
Interrogation consists of two
Questions of my faith

C'mon baby, come on shake me
You won't leave me alone
C'mon make me, c'mon break me
I won't take it at home

I fall back onto the floor
Bright light on my face
Constriction consists when I breathe
From losing my space

C'mon break me, c'mon shake me
You won't leave me alone
C'mon make me, c'mon break me
I won't take it at home

And it's been so long
Since I heard you say
And it's been so long
Since I heard you say

You don't trust me, trust me, trust me, trust me
You don't trust me, trust me

C'mon break me, c'mon shake me
You won't leave it alone
C'mon make me, c'mon break me
You won't take it at home

And it's been so long
Since I heard you say
And it's been so long
Since I heard you say
And it's been so long
Since I heard you say
And it's been so long
Since I heard you say

You don't trust me, trust me, trust me, trust me
You don't trust me, trust me
