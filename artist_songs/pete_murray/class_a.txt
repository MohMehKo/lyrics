Be yourself
If you wanna know your name

Be your friends
And if you ever want to pay

All of this place
Is all about to fall
Right down on you
If you change what you say

And if you wanna hide yourself
Be the one
It's hard to know how far you go

All of this place
Is all about to fall
Right down on you
If you change what you say

And if you wanna hide yourself
Be the one
It's hard to know how far you go

Oh

All of this place
Is all about to fall
Right down on you
If you change what you say

And you know what you know
And you see what you bend
Cant believe its insane
Come on be what you mean
