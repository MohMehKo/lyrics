Sad times go slow well that's understood
When you're gone I slow right down to steer
Is it real is it love or ecstasy
Only with you my veins begin to feel

If we run now were gonna learn today
We can live beyond what we've seen and done
So lock on to your targets and fire at will
Were gonna blow this town out now and run

But without you here I wouldn't be the same
All my worlds come crashing in
And without you here I couldn't play this game
I'd be falling down in a spin

The attacker feels we can achieve greatness
So let's challenge it now and ride it like a stone
There's no time to lose when you've got a life to live
We only learn this the day your life is gone

But without you here I wouldn't be the same
All my worlds come crashing in
And without you here I couldn't play this game
I'd be falling down in a spin

So take this chance come and ride with me
All the roads were on now will only lead us blind
Open up hope chase our destinies
I swear to you now you'll never look behind

But without you here I wouldn't be the same
All my worlds come crashing in
And without you here I couldn't play this game
I'd be falling down in a spin

But without you here I wouldn't be the same
All my worlds come crashing in
And without you here I couldn't play this game
There's no point cause there'd be nothing for me to win
