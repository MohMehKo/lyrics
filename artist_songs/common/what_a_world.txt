What do you see when look at me and I’m just standing there?
S**t that make the world all work that’s what in my blood
And I won’t stop until I drop, cause my life’s just burning our
So walk keep climbing won’t look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world [4x]

A little boy from Chicago had dreams to be a star
And make a way and get some pay and drive a fancy car
Though his mama used to say to him, “Aye boy just go school”
But whether it was old or new, in school he broke the rules

What do you see when look at me and I’m just standing there?
S**t that make the world all work that’s what in my blood
And I won’t stop until I drop, cause my life’s just burning our
So walk keep climbing won’t look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world [4x]

Now his whole life he told his boys, “Hey yall I’m going to rap”
So when he got a rap contract, it wasn’t no turning back
Now his mama she would say to him. “You need to get get back in school”
And all the trash that the peoples say, he was using it for fuel

What do you see when look at me and I’m just standing there?
S**t that make the world all work that’s what in my blood
And I won’t stop until I drop, cause my life’s just burning our
So walk keep climbing won’t look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world [4x]

And the story goes on and on it goes on and on and on
They say, “ Hey boy you rap real good, but ain’t making no good songs”
So he ‘d tell him self yo yo yo self you gotta do it the way you do
And make this musing from your soul and make it fresh and new

What do you see when look at me and I’m just standing there?
S**t that make the world all work that’s what in my blood
And I won’t stop until I drop, cause my life’s just burning our
So walk keep climbing won’t look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world [4x]

Then the fame it started to change, They say music just ain’t the same
Though he remained the song he is sang keep your drive stay in your lane
Inch by inch people ccame the started to know his name and say you do your thang
Now the whole whole world singing his song from Chicago a star it born

What do you see when look at me and I’m just standing there?
