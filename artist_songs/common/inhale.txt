[scratches] Inhale 

I breathe deep 
Like an old man in a deep sleep 
Or an Indian peace pipe 
Identity be 
The beginning, the end, the first, the last 
Breathe into infinity 
A verse that lasts 
Got a chick in the south that be cursin' fast 
When there was a drought then her thirst would last

The hunger of a homeless 
Microphonus 
Played the game - it got a bonus 
Man is the plan 
The master like Tiger 
So much is the drive 
I am the definition of a rider 
Daughter's name means survivor 
From a tribe-a 
Colliders 
Just one word can't describe her 
A scribe of the streets 
And a good life that we all wanna reach 
I'm hotter than a beach 
Flow is so deep 
Even underwater 
I can inhale to bring the world in order
