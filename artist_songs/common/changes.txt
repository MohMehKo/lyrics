[Verse 1 - Common]
I'm the river, that flow to the hood,
To the woods, to the birds, to the mud, to the bricks over the curves 
To the force bizarrs got with 4 acres in the worst to worst 
Planted chrome for the young seeds to know 
Trees is blowin, we see changes in the wind 
This is new day and I gotta take it in 
See a black man run, we need him to win 
Young I search search for a better tomorrow 
Let the belief leave away and the angels hallo 
Open doors for a hope for to go to 
Cause I would chose so and I supposed to 

[Muhsinah - Chorus 2X]
I know that change come come 
The race begun, where all most stare oh yeah 

[Verse 2 - Common]
I spoke like a child, I wrote like a child 
I always smile, let my mind float like a child 
Wishin I was smart as these kids are now 
All grown ups still wishin I'm a child again 
Church saw remaind me to stay grateful 
A more y remaind me to stay playful 
Day's go by, my life all high 
I leave all my walks so the fight don't die 
And me, I found a purpose, why I'm MC 
It's vital young world to be greated than me 
I follow wake and the dream as song 
So the little shorty's can sing along 

[Chorus: 2X]
I know that change come come 
The race begun, where all most stare oh yeah 

[Verse 3 - Common]
Welcome children, welcome me 
Your's sentimentces felt in me 
I see the future and the walking path 
Don't let these fool take you off your path 
Laugh if you need to, smile if you need to 
Life is a trip while a long and proceed to 
Try to believe to, do what you wanna do 
Remember your're kings and queens and still humble to 
Life is a funny you no need to look back again 
Victory can be claim while you still battleing 
Drive along with a food I provide you 
To awake and the voice that's inside you 

[Chorus: 2X]
I know that change come come 
The race begun, where all most stare oh yeah 

Changes is in arable, you can stop it 
Changes happening and everybody is like 
Changes is like the furious hurricane, that you can't stop 
What is change? change is Martin Luther King jr, Ghandi, 
Shakespeare, Tupac Shakur, Barack Obama 
And you can't forget Common 
Changes gone happen 
Change is hope.
