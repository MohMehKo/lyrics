Jetlag, been in a state of
Disaster, ever since I left you
The last time, I saw you just fade away

Now I get lost, tracing my steps back
It cost nearly everything that
I'm not ready to lose today

Oh, no I'm not ready to lose everything I know
I'm letting go of Paris
You know I held on too much
I left you at the station, I put you in my past
Oh and now darling, all that shit is behind us
You never have to wonder, you never have to ask

You never have to

Drink up every last drop and
Shake off the feeling that you're watching
Me now, I should have just told the truth

But now sweetheart, listen to the way I
Cannot forget a single day I
Spent rolling all around the room with you

It's just a fantasy, taking over like a disease
Pull me out of this, I can't breathe
It's burning through my chest

A fantasy, taking over like a disease
Pull me out of this, I can't breathe
I just need a rest

From Paris, you know I held on too much
I left you at the station, I put you in my past
Oh and now darling, all that shit is behind us
You never have to wonder, you never have to ask

You never have to

It's just a fantasy, taking over like a disease
Pull me out of this, I can't breathe
It's burning through my chest

A fantasy, taking over like a disease
Pull me out of this, I can't breathe 
Oh I just need a rest

No I'm not ready to lose you again

Oh Paris, you know I held on too much 
I left you at the station, I put you in my past (put you in my past)
Oh and now darling, all that shit is behind us
You never have to wonder, you never have to ask
You never have to

Paris
Oh darling
You never never never have to ask

You never have to
