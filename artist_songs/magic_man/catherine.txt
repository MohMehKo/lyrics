Where are you now?
Can you take me there?
I’m a thousand miles away from anywhere
If only you could just make the time
We’d cut and run and leave this all behind

So let’s go, go, go
Wherever we can finally be alone, lone, lone
I want to, I need to understand, stand, stand
That everything between us is love
And we’re not making it all up

Catherine, I know
We came so close
But I keep following the feeling that scares me most
Catherine, I tried
You know I’m on your side
I feel you right here
Keeping me up tonight

Know that I will wait for you
Just to shock me back to life and make it through
’Cause honey you are the only kind
Of spirit that can breathe life into mine

So let’s go, go, go
Wherever we can finally be a lone, lone, lone
I want to, I need to understand, stand, stand
That everything between us is love
And we’re not making it all up

Catherine, I know
We came so close
But I keep following the feeling that scares me most
Catherine, I tried
You know I’m on your side
I feel you right here
Keeping me up tonight

Know that I will wait for you
Just to shock me back to life and make it through
’Cause honey you are the only kind
Of spirit that can breathe life into mine
And we’re not making it all up

Catherine, I know
We came so close
But I keep following the feeling that scares me most
Catherine, I tried
You know I’m on your side
I feel you right here
Keeping me up tonight
