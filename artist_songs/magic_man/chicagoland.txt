My god, you make me shiver
Caught in the morning light
Our colors run together
I feel it, come alive

That smile never looked better
But your eyes are so damn cold
They’re leaving twisted rivers
Running right through my soul

And oh, what are you afraid of?
It’s so hard to get away

Won’t you give me a sign, don’t you cover your eyes
When you say my name, it’s so hard to get away
Won’t you give me a sign, don’t you cover your eyes
When you say my name, I know that you care

My god, my heart’s on fire
When I’m tangled in your hair
Can’t sleep, but I'm too tired
How come you're never there?

Just give me one good reason
Why we should fall in line
You’re changing like the seasons
We’re running out of time

And oh, what are you afraid of?
It’s so hard to get away

Won’t you give me a sign, don’t you cover your eyes
When you say my name, it’s so hard to get away
Won’t you give me a sign, don’t you cover your eyes
When you say my name, I know that we can

Shout, shout, shout together
Stay, stay, stay forever
Shout, shout, shout together
Stay, stay, stay forever

Home, Chicagoland
Take me home, Chicagoland
Come on and take me home

Shout, shout, shout together
Stay, stay, stay forever
Shout, shout, shout together
Stay, stay, stay forever
