Life is a painting on the wall
Just a picture in my mind
A photograph that's slowly fading

And now, that all the colors are bleeding out
I'd run away but I don't how, I'd run away but I don't know how

Take my burning heart
Just stay the night, and I’ll keep my promise
But every single day that passes by is making me more dishonest
There’s too much I make up, as soon as I wake up
There’s too much I make up for me

Well, what is left to say?
What is on your mind?
Never felt so condescending but now
That all the secrets are coming out
I can see what it’s all about
I can see that it's all, it's all, it’s all around so

Take my burning heart
Just stay the night, and I’ll keep my promise
But every single day that passes by is making me more dishonest
There’s too much I make up, as soon as I wake up
There’s too much I make up for me

Decided to keep you out of all
The lies and see the way you are [x3]

Take my burning heart
Just stay the night, and I’ll keep my promise
But every single day that passes by is making me more dishonest
There’s too much I make up, as soon as I wake up
There’s too much I make up for me
