I've got a restless heart burning up inside my bones
Just a kid looking out the window of a rusted, run-down mobile home
Warm eyes and a crooked smile, radio droning on and on
Don't hold back, don't hesitate
'Cause we've got fire, it's in our blood

Goddamn this restless heart, keeping me up through the night
I'm flying down the interstate in the same old car that I used to drive
Gold dust in the desert air, radio droning on and on
Don't hold back, don't hesitate
'Cause we've got fire, it's in our blood

You don't need to be careful [x3]

I've got a restless heart, burning up inside my bones
I remember looking out the window of that rusted run down mobile home
Warm eyes And a crooked smile, radio droning on and on
Don't hold back, don't hesitate
'Cause we've got fire, it's in our blood

You don't need to be careful [x3]

We'll hold our heads over the rising tide
We'll find our way without the city lights
The morning sky has never seemed so clear
It all starts here
