Hey, oh what the hell was on your mind that day?
I heard the wind outside your father's car
And felt the weight of life.

Oh, and now
I try to get inside your head somehow.
Storm's coming and it might get loud
So listen while you can,
Oh, I know you care.

From all the windows
The sun will play along.
We'll forget the difference
Between right and wrong.
I feel the sunburn,
The light we grew up with.
We'll forget the past, dear,
And learn to live for this.

Hey, remember what I said before the waves
Came crashing down and turned us inside out?
The ocean's something else.

Oh, will you ever change
The way you feel when you rearrange
The little pieces of your life you keep
So close to your chest?
Well, I know you care.
Well, I know you care.

From all the windows
The sun will play along.
We'll forget the difference
Between right and wrong.
I feel the sunburn,
The light we grew up with.
We'll forget the past, dear,
And learn to live for this.

We'll learn to live for this.
