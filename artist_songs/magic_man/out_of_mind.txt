I've got to know you're coming back
Saw you walking out into the rain
But your shiver is a heart attack
In a silence that I can't explain

You know when you're the first to go
Well it's harder just to be alone
Now we're fading like a photograph
And I'm scared that you're all I have

Cause I know you
It's been a week since I fell apart
They say it's getting better
But if this is the end, then when was the start?
They say it's getting better

I can feel it in my bones
My sanity is on the line
I should've gone, I should've known
That you're out of sight, out of mind

I can't afford to lose the spark
When you're keeping me out in the dark
Now we're fading like a photograph
And I'm scared that you're all I have

Cause I know you
It's been a week since I fell apart
They say it's getting better
But if this is the end, then when was the start?
They say it's getting better

I know you
But do you know me?
Do you know me?
