Oh and if you believe me when I say
You’re not so different now
We’ll stop this little game and save ourselves
But ever since the day I started burning out
Well I know that you’re the one that I’ve been dreaming about

Won’t you take my hand, like I know you will
When you’re sparkling madly in the moonlight
Don’t you understand that I need you still
When you’re sparkling madly in the moonlight

And if you could take another breath
And hold your head up, love
I swear that I will come back from this one
And if we fall asleep in the backseat of your car
We’ll wake up in the snow and bury all our trouble

Won’t you take my hand, like I know you will
When you’re sparkling madly in the moonlight
Don’t you understand that I need you still
When you’re sparkling madly in the moonlight

So stand by, someday we'll call out, and hold it together
Stand by, someday we'll call out, can’t you hold it together
Stand back, someday, call out

Won’t you take my hand, like I know you will
When you’re sparkling madly in the moonlight
Don’t you understand that I need you still
When you’re sparkling madly in the moonlight
