You're the light out on the sea
A twirling seed blown off the tree
Just floating in the wind, rolling on the waves
Slipping out of reach

You're everything I need

I smell honey in your hair
I see longing in your stare
All I know is that you care
And all that I have left is only what I've built here

Oh won't you break me open like the sky at the sunrise
Hear the thunder in this quiet trembling sigh
Hold on to the hand that was there
When you would stare away, as I would lay here

Oh it took me by surprise when all the hunger left your eyes
And you never told me why, only that it's best if we try just to forget
But I'm not finished yet
Now the days turn into weeks, and we're just taking turns to speak
And nothing's clear to me, only that you're there with honey in your hair

Oh won't you break me open like the sky at the sunrise
Hear the thunder in this quiet trembling sigh
Hold on to the hand that was there
When you would stare away, as I would lay here

As I would lay here

As I would lay here

As I would lay here
