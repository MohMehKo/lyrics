If you wait
Darling I'll be here
I'll let myself in
Darling don't you fear

I'll be here
I'll be here

I said
I'm feeling like a basement lover
Cross eyed, or buried undercover well
It's just another shape
Right angles of a plastic frame

You see
I'm feeling like we know each other
Flashback but it's in real life colors 
It’s like the one I saw
It’s like the one I saw

But hold my head above the water
Hold my head above the water slide 

Are you feeling like I thought you would be
I'm only just a gentleman, you see 
But you don't see me do you
No you don’t see me

But hold my head above the water
Hold my head above the water slide
The water slide
Oh, the water slide

And we'll be 
Talking, talking, talking, talking, talking all the way home
Talking, talking, talking, talking, talking all the way home

We'll be 
Talking, talking, talking, talking, talking all the way home
Talking, talking, talking, talking, talking all the way home
