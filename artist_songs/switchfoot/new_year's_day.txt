They tell me the best in life is free
And I feel spent so I guess it means that the best is mine
But it doesn’t seem so
While I’m out here confessing things
All last year got the best of me
And I’m not sure I’m ready for another go
It’s New Year’s Day

Euphoria’s gone, it’s time to move on
I have to believe we can change
When the notes come out wrong
Stop singing along
We can’t be the same old thing
It’s New Year’s Day

I’m tearing down the past years off the wall (it’s New Year’s Day)
I’m coming at you like a wrecking ball (it’s New Year’s Day)
And I think I’m gonna make it after all
It’s New Year’s Day

I said sometimes I can’t stand myself
And most times I wish I could be anyone else
When I look in the mirror my eyes are getting old
And she said yeah I see your point of view
But it could be just a phase that you’re going through
And it feels like we could make something beautiful
It’s New Year’s Day

I’m tearing down the past years off the wall (it’s New Year’s Day)
I’m coming at you like a wrecking ball (it’s New Year’s Day)
And I think I’m gonna make it after all
It’s New Year’s Day

Euphoria’s gone, it’s time to move on
I have to believe we can change
When the notes come out wrong
Stop singing along
We can’t be the same old thing
It’s New Year’s Day

I’m tearing down the past years off the wall (it’s New Year’s Day)
I’m coming at you like a wrecking ball (it’s New Year’s Day)
And I think I’m gonna make it after all
Yeah I think we’re gonna make it after all
And I think I’m gonna make it after all
It’s New Year’s Day

I think we’re gonna make it after all (it’s gonna be okay)
Yeah I think we’re gonna make it after all (it’s gonna okay)
Yeah I think we’re gonna make it after all
It’s New Year’s Day
