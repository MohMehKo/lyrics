[Verse:]
Here's an invitation and you gotta bring your friends along.
Gonna pick you up tonight at one.
A private Vengaparty that is gonna last the whole night long
Dance until the cops show up, 'cause then we gotta run.
We don't care what the people say,
Nothing's gonna stop us gonna do it anyway.
Tonight's the night let us show you how
Hey what u waiting for... get in the water now!!!!

[Chorus:]
Listen up tonight it's on
Take your clothes off
Skinnydippin' all night long
That's what we love
Come along let's have some fun
Take your clothes off
Skinny dippin' all night long

Get in the water now!
Take your clothes off!
Get in the water now!
That's what we love!

[Verse]

[Chorus x2]
