[Perez Hilton]
Eenie Meenie Miney Moe, this rocket ship has got to go!

[Vengaboys]
There is a house, in the heart of kings and town. 
A place that you never see.
The secret house, in the heart of kings and town, where we've been building our dream. 

Get up now, it's time to go.
Blast off, your standing alone.
It's there, I swear...
5 4 3 2 1

[Chorus]
I'm on a rocket to uranus, 
and the rocket's gonna take us, 
to the planet that'll save us.
Oh Woah Woah Woah
Fly! On a mission to a higher low,
the invitation you've been dreamin' of,
let's have a party on uranus!

There is a place,
3 billion clicks away, 
where you find freedom to all.
It's new, it's cool and the light can last all day.
Counting down, final call.

If you haven't got a thing to wear,
it doesn't really matter up there.
Come on, we're gone!

[Chorus]
I'm on a rocket to uranus, 
and the rocket's gonna take us, 
to the planet that'll save us.
Oh Woah Woah Woah
Fly! On a mission to a higher low,
the invitation you've been dreamin' of,
let's have a party on uranus!

[Perez Hilton]
Party time!
Look!
I can see it...
We're almost there.
Uranus is so pretty!
It feels like home.

[Vengaboys]
Oh woah woah woah
Fly! On a mission to a higher low,
the invitation you've been dreamin' of,
let's have a party on uranus!

[Perez Hilton]
That was a fast journey!
