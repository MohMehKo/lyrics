I got fire in my pants
You about to burn your hands

Ya man
Soon
Here we go

Me mind on fire 
Me soul on fire 
Feeling hot hot hot
Party people 
All around me feeling hot hot hot
Oh what to do - on a night like this
Music sweet - I can't resist
We need a party song - a fundamental jam

Ole ole - ole ole
Ole ole - ole ole
Ole ole - ole ole

Venga's got the brand new sound
Burn this motherfuckin' down

Here we go

Here we go

Bubble up, bubble up, girl bubble
Wine for your booty on the double
I got fire in my pants
You about to burn your hands
Eh-oh
Venga, Venga, girl freak me with your style
Eh-oh
This is the game we play
Get down when the DJ god say

If you didn't come to party, p-p-par-part, par-party
Get the hell out of this club
(Get the hell out of this club)
If you didn't come to party, p-p-par-part, par-party
Get the hell out of this club
Club, club, club, club

Ole ole - ole ole
Ole ole - ole ole
Ole ole - ole ole
Ole ole - ole ole
Ole ole - ole ole

Venga's got the brand new sound
Burn this motherfuckin' down

Here we go

Here we go

Hands in the air 
Celebration time
Let music
Captivate your mind
We have this party song 

Venga's got the  brand new sound
Turn, t-turn, t-turn, turn it up

Ole ole - ole ole
Ole ole - ole ole
Ole ole - ole ole
Ole ole - ole ole
