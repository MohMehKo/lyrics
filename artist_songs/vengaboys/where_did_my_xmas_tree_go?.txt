Woke up this morning all me friends were gone
Because they didn't get to eat

Now since I lost it all, me on me own
I guess dis zipcode is only for me

Woke up this mornin and me baby was gone
Because him didn't get no cash 
But I don't care cause I will party on and so I put all his clothes in the trash

Everybody

Eyo ehe e eyo where did my Christmas Tree go?
Eyo ehe e eyo where did it go I don't know

We do it every Christmas Time
We do it every Christmas Time
Yes, we do it every Christmas Time
Every Christmas Time
We do it every Christmas Time

Woke up this mornin and me garden was green
Me uncle John just passed away
Called me his daughter left a magical bean
Now di good times have come here to stay

Everybody

We do it every Christmas Time
We do it every Christmas Time
Yes, we do it every Christmas Time
Every Christmas Time
We do it every Christmas Time

Eyo ehe e eyo

Everybody

Where did it go I don't know
