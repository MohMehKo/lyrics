[verse:] 
It's party night, we're hangin' with our friends
We're having a great time, we're breakin' all the fence

[bridge:] 
o-o- so you too come and join us
no need to feel shy
o-o- come grab this party feelin', 
let's do it let's do it 

[chorus:]
There's a venga party for 48 hrs. 
Hunks and babes dancin' under the showers
48 hrs., 48 hrs are not enough for us

yo party
yo party 
venga venga party 
48 hrs...
