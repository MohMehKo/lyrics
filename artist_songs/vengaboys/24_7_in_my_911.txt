I got my top down
And I'm ready to roll
Watch me go now
I'm leaving this town
To the Costa del Sol
Come on let's go now

[BRIDGE]
The stars are out tonight
The moon is shinning down on me
With rays of pure delight
And I'll be spendin'

[CHORUS]
24/7 in my 911
And I ain't gonna work
A9-2-5
24/7 in my 911
On a highway to heaven
It's the time of my life

Crusin'
Crusin' down the street
Crusin'
Crusin' down the street
Up and down the street

You're my lover
You're my Romeo
Watch me glow now
Rockin' to the rhythum
On Venga radio
Don't let go now

[BRIDGE]

[REPEAT CHORUS]
