Sometimes I hate being in love wit' a thug (Ladies I got something on my mind) 
Sometimes I hate being in love wit' a thug (Oohh let me take a second) 
Sometimes I hate being in love wit' a thug (Raise your hand if you feel me) 

[VERSE 1:]
I'm always staying up late, wondering if your coming home ok 
I know you gotta make ends meet that why your out there on the streets 
See I understand the game, but I know there might just come a day 
When your sister or your mama calls and tells me that you've been taken away 

[CHORUS:]
Sometimes I hate being in love wit' a thug (Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, yea) 
Sometimes I hate being in love wit' a thug (Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, yea, yea) 
Sometimes I hate being part of this ghetto love (Oh no) 
Sometimes I hate being in love wit' a thug (Be quiet, na, na, na, na) 

[VERSE 2:]
I understand that your concerned about me 
Don't me you go putting our business in the streets 
Girl you know we got these [?]
So instead of singing songs lets talk about it later 
I had a job that I really didn't wanna quit 
I just got tired of taking all of the bullshhh 
See I been working at Mickie D's about 4 years now 
And I just think its time to get up off these burgers now 
Took a lot for us to get out in these suburbs 
Took a lot for me to buy you all these nice furs 
We'll go to church and pray about it and I promise that 
But girl, bare with me to I open up this Laundromat 

[CHORUS:]
Sometimes I hate being in love wit' a thug (See a mans gotta do, what a mans gotta do) 
Sometimes I hate being in love wit' a thug (Baby, the streets have nothing to do with me and u) 
Sometimes I hate being part of this ghetto love (Now I know I'm not perfect, babeeee) 
Sometimes I hate being in love wit' a thug (One thing I know that is that I love you baby) 

[VERSE 3:]
Now we gotta run and hide, you my man so I'm stayin' by your side (That's what I'm talking bout baby) 
Mama we gonna move down south, when this heat cools down, we'll be alright (I think that would be best) 
He's gotta few peeps down there, with some cash and a place to lay our heads (And I could trust them, baby) 
I guess he didn't know them that well, cuz we're locked up, they all turned out to be fake 

[CHORUS:]
Sometimes I hate being in love wit' a thug (Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes) 
Sometimes I hate being in love wit' a thug (SOMETIMES I HATE IT) 
Sometime I hate it (But I'm gon' stand by you) 
Sometime I hate it (No matta what we go through) 
Sometime I hate it (Through thick and thin) 
Sometime I hate it (Ur my love) 
Sometime I hate it (See they can lock me up) 
Sometime I hate it (Throw away the key) 
Sometime I hate it (Just as long as you) 
Sometime I hate it (You're here wit' me) 
Sometimes I hate being in love wit' a thug 
But I love you my baby so come here and give me a hug
