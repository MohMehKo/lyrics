[Dialogue:]
For real I can't take this no more
I gotta get out the house I can't deal with him no more

Why do you keep coming over here
With the same old BS every other week
You know you're not going anywhere
So why you keep lying to me?
I know you, the only thing about it is
He knows you better (You think so)
He knows you ain't going nowhere
Come to think of it
If I was you I wouldn't go nowhere either
Let him go, put his ass out
Know what I'm saying
Look all you gotta do is tell him

I'm through
Trying to prove my love
I'm through baby
Oh man I'm through
Sometimes I had to give up what was right
When I knew it was wrong
But I believe stand here today on my very own
Cause I've found someone and I know he understands
That I know what it really means,
What it really means to have a real man
You see his daily deeds and the things he does and says
He says I'm not trying to take your boyfriend's place but if I can't help ya
I swear I won't get in your way
Tell him, tell him, tell ya man you're through
Trying to prove your love to him
Go on girl tell ya man you're through
Trying to prove your love to him

See I'm through staying up all night
Waiting for you to return
I can't think of a better lesson
I had better learn
But you'll find out further on down the road
See I let you take my heart
But I can't, I can't let you take my soul
It's always happening in so many love affairs
Yeah you so in love today, so in love today but tomorrow tomorrow
You just don't care
One gets tired and gives up on loving the other
Then the other goes running in the streets,
Running in the streets, just running in the streets
Trying to find it in another

You're through
Tell the man that you're through right now

(Proving my love to you)

Baby I'm through (through)
(Go on, go on) I'm going (tell the man that you're through)
I'm done

(Through) See I ain't even mad about it, yes in fact I feel so
Cause I got a good man (through)(through) I'm gone

I'm not gonna sit here and try to convince you that I'm gone
I'm gonna head home and pack up [?] and put it outside the door
And he can just stay right wherever he is with the woman he decided to be with
Go ahead he chose her let him stay there
But I'm through
