Sharissa where you at

I was just about to say I'm sorry for being late,
But I can't say nothing
The accusations you gripe ad you complain,
You always mad about something.
You'd be wilding out if you knew I had packed my things,
But I ain't saying nothing.
The decision of a lifetime I'm having second thoughts about you for the last time.

Maybe it's all good that it's come down to this
(Maybe it's all good yeah)
before we bought the house the cars before we had any kids
(don't need to bring no kids into this mess)
Knowing this is a big mistake that I'll regret much later
(For you to think out)
What it takes for you to be my lover

If you gonna love me
love me all the way completely
baby no half stepping
give me give me what it takes
to make me feel
if you gonna leave me baby leave today
ain't got no time
to waist this love on no one
who don't need it
don't know what to do with it.

You checkin my pagers scrolling down my caller Id
Like trust ain't a factor
When all the while baby you were cheating on me
Did you regret the morning after?
Even though you had these tendencies from the start of this thing
I thought I could change you
You made it easy to decide there's no way that I could never be your wife

Maybe it's all good that it's come down to this
(Maybe it's all good_
before we bought the house the cars before we had any kids
(don't need to be taking no children into this abuse no no no)
Knowing this is a big mistake that I'll regret much later
(boy you ain't the one that I wanna take)
What it takes for you to be my lover

If you gonna love me (if you gonna love me yeah)
love me all the way completely (yeah yeah)
baby no half stepping (no half stepping)
give me give me what it takes (give me this love to make me feel it's real yeah)
to make me feel
if you gonna leave me baby leave today (if you leaving, leave)
ain't got no time
to waist this love on no one (no half of you)
who don't need it
don't know what to do with it.

Uh

If you gonna love me

to make me feel (keep it moving)
if you gonna leave me baby leave today (Oh yeah)
