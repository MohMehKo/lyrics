[Verse 1:]
Tragedy when the judge gave you 1 to 3, You looked at me
I kissed you good-bye, You wiped the tearz from my eyez
Said don't wait for me
But I want you to know

[Chorus:]
As long as you're gone, Home won't be home
As long as you know, I'm waiting, for you
I will be waiting, As long as you're gone
Home won't be home

[Verse 2:]
Sitting on this bus, Yeah I'm coming up
There's women laughin and children crying, But I'm dyin
I been missing you and I gotta tell you face to face
That I'm still in love with you

[Chorus:]
As long as you're gone babe, Home won't be home
As long as you know, I'm waiting, for you
I will be waiting, As long as you're gone
Home won't be home

[Bridge:]
But when you start feeling lonely
Hang on in there
When you feel you ain't got nobody
Hang on in there
When they got you locked down in there
Hang on in there
Look at these thoughts
And Hear Me Say
Hang on in there

[Chorus:]
As long as you know, I'm waiting for you
I will be waiting
As long as you're gone, Home won't be home With Outcha
