Woaah 
Woaah
Woaaahohh
Over, over a man

[Verse 1:]
We been tight since junior high
Now were faced with this lie
Why would I make up your man tryna talk to me
Tryna get wit me 
u confronted him to see whats up 
he ran that game and switched it up
makin everything out to be on me
honey please

[Chorus: x2]
So you really wanna stop speakin over a man (over a man)
Best friends and you wanna fight me over a man (over a man)
Why u gotta come to this my sista over a man (over a man)
I'm gonna do what I gotta do if u raise your hand over a man 

[Verse 2:]
Think of where we been and where we’re at
And once we move we can’t go back
Its ashame you’d rather be his fool than be my friend
See we been crew since the hood and I don’t care
Ain't no thing that good
Is this the thanks I get for lookin out and bein your friend

[Chorus: x2]
So you really wanna stop speakin over a man (over a man)
Best friends and you wanna fight me over a man (over a man)
Why u gotta come to this my sista over a man (over a man)
I'm gonna do what I gotta do if u raise your hand over a man 

[Hook:]
And how could you believe that mess about me
(Im not even tryna stress) cant you see 
(He’s got you on some other mess) 
And best friends are all I thought we’d ever be
(coming between us two) but cant you see 
(cant you see he’s clowning you) 
Oh he’s clowning you

[Chorus: to fade]
