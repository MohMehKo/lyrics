This kinda hurts
But I know my worth
You don't know how to respect a woman, no
Think I'm a fool
See I caught you
Last night you left your pager next to mines
Silly dude

I know you'll never find
You'll never find
Someone like me again
So go back to the streets
You will see that I was the real one
I know you'll never find
You'll never find
Someone like me again
So go back to the streets
You will see that I was the real one

Can't take no more
Your bags are at the door
You thought I would forgive you once again
No I'm gonna ride solo
It was such a low blow
And I can't believe
That you are so sneaky

With my best friend you tried to pull it
Up over my eyes yes you did
If she was with it you would've did it
And it's somethin' I can't deal with
Now boy you know that I loved you
But now I got to leave you
Cause I can't trust you
You'll never find a love like mine

[Chorus x3]

It was such a low blow
You will see that I was the real one
Now you gotta go
You will see that I was the real one
You really broke my heart
You will see that I was the real one
Now it's time that we part
You will see that I was the real one

[Chorus]
