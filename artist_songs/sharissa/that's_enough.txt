All I need
Is a man who deserves to be my king
All I want
Is a one woman man only loving me
All I need
Who ain't afraid to show me love around my peeps
All I want
Let me break it down more tell you what I need
I like a

[Chorus:]
Low key guy that like to handle his biz
Treats women like queens
Cause he knows who he is
That's enough to get my love
So you have a fancy car and jewellery
Just show me your heart that's what I wanna see
That's enough to get my love, to get my love

All I need
He'll be delighted when I tell him that
I'm having his baby boy
All I want
And he'll be there when I'm in labor and I'm crying tears of joy
All I need
For him to get down on one knee and propose to me
All I want
Is for this fantasy to come true with a ring and say "I do"

Heard a songwriter say it best
Make it last forever
I won't settle for less
A simple love no never
I've been through so much
There's a blessing coming
From above to me, to me

[Chorus x2]

Heard a songwriter say it best
Make it last forever
I won't settle for less
A simple love no never
I've been through so much
But I know it
That there's a blessing coming from above

[Chorus x2]
