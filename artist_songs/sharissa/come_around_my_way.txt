We been on some love [?] for bout two years
Losing a [?] like you brings me tears
Over an argument it's not that serious let's get over it
Why you wanna leave a happy home
If you need your space then there's the door
If it doesn't work for you just remember boo
I got love for you
I got you covered

[Chorus:]
If you need a place to stay
Come around my way
If you need a place to stay
Come around my way
If you need a place to stay
If you need a place to stay
Come around my way
Come around my way to me

It's true
No one is gonna love me like you do
I'll never front or flip the script on you
So stop trippin, baby, knock it off, that's enough, bring it home, I can't take no more
Let's take a shot at it again
You and me a couple we'll win
But if it doesn't work for you just remember boo
I got love for you
I've got you covered

[Chorus]

Remember the time we split ten dollars for [?] & chicken
Remember the time we hopped the train we got busted with no tokens
And remember our first trip to the Bahamas it was on and poppin
And all of these things they should make you stay
So come around my way

[Chorus]
