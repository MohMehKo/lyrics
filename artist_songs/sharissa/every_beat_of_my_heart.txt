How was I so fortunate
To come across you
When I wasn't lookin
To get myself into
Another relationship
I said that I was through
At least for a while
And everything change
Right in front of me
I fell in love with you
And now I wanna be
Nestled in your arms
Forever your lady
I said it before
And I am saying it now

With every beat of my heart
I love you, I want to
Be with you forever
With every beat of my heart
I just wanna make sure
You know that I'm yours

Every single day
I seem to find a few
Special quality separating you
From anyone that I
Have ever been priviledged to
Get to know, yeah
When you touch me
It's a magic touch
And then you're making love to me
I get such a rush
Now I know what it means
To love someone so much
That you don't ever wanna let go
With every beat of my heart
