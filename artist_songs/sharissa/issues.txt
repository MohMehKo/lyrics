[Verse 1:]
Seems Like I'm Always Mad At You,
And It's Always Something You Did
Or Something That You Didn't Do.
And I'm Always Telling You That You Could Leave, 
And From The Minute You Walked Out It Doesn't Feel Right To Me. 

[Chorus:]
Cause Everybody Wants That Perfect Love.
Oh Yes They Do, But I'll Take You And Your Imperfections.
Your Love Is Like An Oven,
And Sometimes I Don't Know What To Do. 
You Got Issues, But I Miss You.
All I'm Saying Is You Got A Lot Of Stuff With You [x6] Yes You Do. 
You Got A Lot Of Stuff With You. Yes You Do, Yes You Do.

[Verse 2:]
My Friends Always Express They Doubt.
So The More We Stay Together, Give Them 
Something To Talk About. And Even Though
I Know You're Not Well To Do, And You Don't 
Have A Lot Of Money But You Show Got A Lot
Of You.

[Chorus:]
Cause Everybody Wants That Perfect Love (Ooh)
But I'll Take You And All Your Imperfections.
Your Love Is Like An Oven,
And Sometimes I Don't Know What To Do. 
You Got Issues, But I Miss You.
All I'm Saying Is Yeah You Got A Lot Of Stuff With You [x6]
Yes You Do Baby (Yes You Do) Yes You Do 
You Got A Lot Of Stuff With You Yeah Yeah . Yes You Do, 
Yes You Do.
Your Love Is Oh Baby And Sometimes Everybody's Got Issues
Everybody's Got Issues Babe. (Oh) Yes You Do You Got A Lot Of Stuff With You
And Your Love Yeah 

[Climax:]
Oh Good Lovin Babe
Is So Hard To Come By 
A Good Friend
And A Piece Of Mind 
And A Piece Of Mind Baby
Keep On Lovin Me 
Keep Lovin Me 
The Other Stuff With Pass By
Yes They Can Yes They Can 
Your Not Perfect All The Time
But Lord Knows You're The Perfect Kind So 

[Chorus:]
Your Love Is Like An Oven,
Love And Sometimes Oh You Got Issues Baby 
And Sometimes I Don't Know What To Do. 
You Got Issues, But I Miss You. 
But It Don't Take Away From You Oh No Oh No
A Lot Of Stuff With You 
Yes You Do Yes You Do
Your Love Is Like An Oven 
Your Love Yeah
You Got Issues But I Missed (Issues Boy You Got Issues)
You Got A Lot Of Stuff With You 
Yes You Do Yes You Do 
Your Love Is Like An Oven
Just Like An Oven Babe
