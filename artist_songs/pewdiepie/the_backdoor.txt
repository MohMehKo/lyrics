I don't know how 
That you can't see
I have more feelings for you 
Than you have feelings for me
In the night, in the morning, in the day 
I don't know how to tell you that I'm
No idea what the fuck I'm doing
All I wanna tell you put it in my poop-in

So it's time to tell you how I feel 
I waited for this moment
I waited for this moment!
I waited for you!

We shared all our secrets
You know me in and out
But there is a detail
I haven't told about

I'll let you slip it in the backdoor!
I'll let you slip it in the backdoor!
I'll let you slip it in the backdoor!
The backdoor! 
I'll let you slip it in the backdoor!
I'll let you slip it in the backdoor!
I'll let you slip it in the backdoor!
The backdoor!

Now that I told you 
What I really wanted to say
There's something manlier 
Then two men being really gay

Rub my pecks, rub my bi's
Rub my abs and rub my thights
Rub my ass and rub my balls
Rub them till the morning calls

It's time to tell you how I feel 
I waited for this moment
I waited for this moment!
I waited for you!

We shared all our secrets
You know me in and out
But there is a detail
I haven't told about

I'll let you slip it in the backdoor!
I'll let you slip it in the backdoor!
I'll let you slip it in the backdoor!
The backdoor! 
I'll let you slip it in the backdoor!
I'll let you slip it in the backdoor!
I'll let you slip it in the backdoor!
The backdoor!

The ship has sailed!
Call the captain!
The ship has sailed
Without you!
I don't want just a tale
I want you to come inside too!

Maybe we'll always just be friends
Maybe we'll get some fake girlfriends
You don't see me the same way
You're not even close to being gay!

It's clean
I waxed it
(maybe we'll always just be friends)
I shaved it 
And tested it myself
It's clean
I waxed it
(maybe we'll always just be friends)
I shaved it 
And tested it myself

I'll let you slip it in the backdoor!
I'll let you slip it in the backdoor!
I'll let you slip it in the backdoor!
The backdoor! 
I'll let you slip it in the backdoor!
I'll let you slip it in the backdoor!
I'll let you slip it in the backdoor!
The backdoor!

My backdoor is for you!
My backdoor adores you!

The ship has sailed!
Call the captain!
The ship has sailed
Without you!

Maybe we'll always just be friends
Maybe we'll always just be... 
Friends
