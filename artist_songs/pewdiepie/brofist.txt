When things are tough,
And you've had enough.
Who is there?
To curb your fear?
All bridges burned.
Nowhere to turn.
Who will come?
To cheer you on! (Yeah!)

Never let go, go, go!
Never give up, up, up!
Never let go, never give up!
You can reach your end goal.
Never let go, go go!
Never give up, up, up!
Never let go, never give up!
You let go, you asshole!

Do you know how PewDie says goodbye?
(Brofist!)
Close your hand, let's give this thing a try!
(Brofist!)
Everyone just wants to fist this guy!
(Brofist!)
Pewdiepie-ie, Pewdiepie-ie
(Brofist!)
Lost all you had,
A good thing gone bad.
All alone,
In the unknown.
Then in the mist, you see a fist.
Then who knew?
The legend's true.

(Yeah!)
Never let go, go, go!
Never give up, up, up!
Never let go, never give up!
You can reach your end goal.
Never let go, go, go!
Never give up, up, up!
Never let go, never give up!
You let go, you asshole!

Do you know how PewDie says goodbye?

Maybe you wanna quit,
When things fail...
But you can't just fail when things quit.
Maybe you wanna quit,
When things fail...
But you can't just fail when things quit.
Yeaaahhh!
