This one goes out to all you kohais out there
I want you to know that, I feel your pain
And I've been in the same seat
But hopefully one day, It will be better
Until then, this one goes out to all of y'all

Ey yo, it's your boy Falcon Lord
Since the day I've been living without umbilical cord
I've been keeping the score
I've been wanting it more
Some might call me a whore
But not any fucking more
Senpai this relationship has really been one sided
Senpai I am sorry but I think you've been misguided
But now it's your turn to pay me back
Senpai please bend over and suck my ass

Senpai suck my ass
We'll be together
Senpai suck my ass
It will last forever
Senpai suck my ass
It's a sweet sensation
Senpai suck my ass
These words are desperation

I don't know if you will like it
But I think that you should try it
You don't even have to suck it
Stick that tongue out lightly schmuck it
I don't know if you will like it
But I think that you should try it
Senpai please just do this for me
Some say it taste like Potpourri

I even made it all nice and clean there for you
I shaved it, what else do you want me to do?
It took you forever to even give me a notice
Now I'm seriously considering talking to a proctologist
Bend over and look at my two circle figures
How they bounce so nice? I don't know, go figure
Just let your lips penetrate, feel a burning sensation
Get closer to God, in that tight situation

Senpai suck my ass
We'll be together
Senpai suck my ass
It will last forever
Senpai suck my ass
It's a sweet sensation
Senpai suck my ass
These words are desperation

Senpai suck my ass (I don't know if you will like it)
We'll be together (But I think that you should try it)
Senpai suck my ass (You don't even have to suck it)
It will last forever (Stick that tongue out lightly schmuck it)
Senpai suck my ass (I don't know if you will like it)
It's a sweet sensation (But I think that you should try it)
Senpai suck my ass (You don't even have to suck it)
These words are desperation (Stick that tongue out lightly schmuck it)

Keep fighting falcon lovers and kohais
And maybe one day, we'll get what we want
Until then, buy all my merch
I'm, I'm serious, I, it all goes to me pretty much
Buy my merch, I need to feed my crack addiction
