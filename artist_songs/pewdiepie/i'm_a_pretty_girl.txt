How's it going bros? My name's PewDiePie

Anyone can be, who they want to be
Even a duck, even a duck
I didn't think I had that, that teenage girl inside me
We all do, (we all do) yes it's true (yes it's true)

Ohh
I'm a pretty girl
Pretty, pretty, pretty girl
Oh look it's a little little squirrel
I'm naked in space
Just know that I love you anyway, anyway
I'm a pretty girl
Pretty, pretty, pretty girl
You get one chance to save the world, save the world
Oh look, I'm a pretty, pretty, pretty girl
Oh look, I'm a pretty, pretty, pretty girl

Feels weird to be on this side of the friendzone
Just know that it's nothing personal (nothing personal)
I never stood out too much, 'til I had that voice in my dream
Got new shoes, got new shoes, yes, it's true, yes, it's true

Ohh
I'm a pretty girl
Pretty, pretty, pretty girl
Oh look it's a little little squirrel
I'm naked in space
Just know that I love you anyway, anyway
I'm a pretty girl
Pretty, pretty, pretty girl
You get one chance to save the world, save the world
Oh look, I'm a pretty, pretty, pretty girl
Oh look, I'm a pretty, pretty, pretty girl

Ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, dick
Pie, pie, pie, pie, pie
Dick, dick, dick, dick
Dick, dick, dick, dick
No, no, whyyy?
No, no, whyyy?
Maya, Maya, Maaya
Why are you nibbling on my titties, Maya
Maya, Maya, Maaya
Why are you nibbling on my titties, Maya
(We all do, we all do, yes, it's true, yes, it's true)

Ohh
I'm a pretty girl
Pretty, pretty, pretty girl
Oh look it's a little little squirrel
I'm naked in space
Just know that I love you anyway, anyway
I'm a pretty girl
Pretty, pretty, pretty girl
You get one chance to save the world, save the world
Oh look, I'm a pretty, pretty, pretty girl
Oh look, I'm a pretty, pretty, pretty girl
