(I feel their eyes upon my skin; feels like they look so deep within)

I feel their eyes upon my skin; feels like they look so deep within
I'm breaking down, feels like I'm losing ground
They think cause I am full of faith, I must be perfect everyday
But they don't understand, I'm just a man, held in your hands

[Chorus:]
But what say
But what say you
But what say you
God, please tear me down, and let me break my crown
Cause then when I bleed out, Your blood can fill me up again
Well I want to become nothing. (to become nothing)
I want to become nothing so you can be everything

(When they see me then they see you)

When they see me then they see you
I pray your love comes shining through
What those hands hide
I think you're significantly above the rest
I find with time, I change my mind
I know your plans are so divine
Retrace my steps, they always lead back to you

[Chorus:]
But what say
But what say you
But what say you
God, please tear me down, and let me break my crown
Cause then when I bleed out, your blood can fill me up again
Well I want to become nothing
I want to become nothing, so you can be everything

(Be everything, be everything, everything)

My old friend makes me sick
And I can't handle this
Insufficient on my own
Jesus, take me home (take me home)

God please tear me down, and let me break my crown.
Cause then when I bleed out Your blood can fill me up again.
Well, I want to become nothing.
Well, I want to become nothing so you can be everything.
So you can be everything.
Oh my God, be everything.
