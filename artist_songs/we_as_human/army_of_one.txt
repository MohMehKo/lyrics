I sleep with one eye open and never trust anyone
And I'm always standing on the edge
These bones have been broken, but I'm not afraid of a little blood
'Cause I'd rather die than just give in
Before they lay me down beneath the roses and the stones
I will find the truth and peace that I've been looking for

[Chorus:]
In my head, in my head I'm an army of one
Fighting war after war, 'cause I won't lay down my gun
I will always believe every man should be free
There's no surrender in this army of one
There's no surrender in this army of one

This world's gonna tell you what you should be and what you can't do
Just because it's never been done
This road twists and turns, and if you crash and burn just start again
Because the sting of failure doesn't hurt as bad as giving in

Don't want to live with regret
Don't want to wonder what if
'Cause I need you for a life that is higher than this

[Chorus x2]

In my head, in my head I'm an army of one
Fighting war after war, but God knows won't lay down my guns
I will always believe every man should be free
There's no surrender in this army of one
