What have I done with life, I close my eyes, and now I say I can't see
Because of the tears that fall, I built the walls and now unfortunately
Well, I try to talk to you and I can't break through and it's killing me
Well, I feel lost inside the space between

So I'm done making excuses for mistakes I've made
For so long now I have found the way to pass the blame
Oh, I know you will forgive me if I turn away
From this life of shame you have made a way

I'm taking life
I'm getting older
I won't back down
I'm getting closer
I'm taking life
I'm far from over
It's not the end
This is not the end

So many years I've wasted selfishly, embraced the natural things
And I thought that I was fine as long as I didn't bring someone pain
But now I've begun to see your plan for me, it's so much more than this game
Father cover me, just like the rain

I'm taking life
I'm getting older
I won't back down
I'm getting closer
I'm taking life
I'm far from over
It's not the end
This is not the end, yeah.

My eyes are open and my path is straight
You moved the mountain so there's nothing in my way
Your love is boundless and forever stays the same
I am on my way
I am on my way

Oh, I'm taking life
I'm getting older
I won't back down
I'm getting closer
I'm taking life
I'm far from over
It's not the end
This is not the end

I don't wanna waste my life, oh
Oh!

I'm taking life
I'm getting older
I won't back down
I'm getting closer
I'm taking life
I'm far from over
It's not the end
This is not the end
This is not the end
