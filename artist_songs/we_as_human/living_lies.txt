I wear the face of an only son
But inside I'm coming undone
Beneath the skin I'm not what you see
There's someone else living in me

And I know
That one day I'll be exposed
The secrets hidden in my soul
Buried alive 

Beneath these lies
Of who I am 
I'm a broken man
And i cant break free it's killing me
All these lies I can't erase
Take this pain apart of me
I despise living lies
Living lies

I feel the weight of mistakes I've made
I built a world without any grace
I'm like a ship that's tossed in the sea
Drifting, drowning, waiting to sink

And I know
That one day I'll be exposed
The secrets hidden in my soul
Buried alive

Beneath these lies
Of who i am 
I'm a broken man
And I cant break free it's killing me
All these lies I can't erase
Take this pain apart of me
I despise living lies
Living lies

Don't wanna live like this
I don't wanna die like this
I shed my innocence
I shed my innocence!

Lies
Of who I am 
I'm a broken man
And I cant break free it's killing me
All these lies I can't erase
Take this pain apart of me
I despise living lies
Living lies

Of who I am 
I'm a broken man
And I cant break free it's killing me
All these lies I can't erase
Take this pain apart of me
I despise living lies
Living lies

Don't wanna live like this
I don't wanna die like this
I shed my innocence
I shed my innocence!
