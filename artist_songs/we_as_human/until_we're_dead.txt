This is my question
This is my question
I just want to know
Why does God let things go on in this world
Things so sick that I want to leave
And just burn it all behind me
How much worse can this get
That he won't stop 'till were dead
And the little truth that is left
Is being twisted by the press
10 million people know my name
My judgment shouldn't be the same
Yes I murder, you know I do
But I'm not the same as you
I'll give my money to the system
They'll let me walk free as a victim
They say murder is a sickness
And killing is just a symptom

You let us fall so far
'Till we turn and reach out to you
But we'll never fall so far
That He can't save us again

Tolerance tolerance
Accept me how I am
And if you don't accept me
Then you hate me
So off with your head
God bless America
Land of the free
And home of the depraved
Kind of makes me wonder
How long God will let this go on
In this land of decay

You let us fall so far
'Till we turn and reach out to you
But we'll never fall so far
That He can't save us again

He'll let us fall so far
Till we turn and reach out to him
But we'll never fall so far
That He can't save us again

Just remember in the strangest of days
God still works and moves
And he still will use you and me
No matter how unworthy
Because we're all unworthy
