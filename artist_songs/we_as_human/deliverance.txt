Its time for bed. Go to sleep little ones.
Rest your head. Daddy loves you, he loves you.
The worlds asleep, but there's no sleep for me.
I feel the nudge, to fill my veins with these drugs.

I, I hate myself, for who I am, for what I've done.
I just need some deliverance. Cause I hate myself, for who I am, for what I've done.
I just need some deliverance.

(Just need some deliverance.)

I'm so afraid, cause this addiction won't break.
It takes and takes. And leaves me nothing, with nothing.
I feel alone. I feel there's nobody out there. I'm all alone.
I could just end this right here.

Cause I, hate myself, for who I am, for what I've done.
I just need some deliverance. Cause I, hate myself, for who I am, for what I've done.
I just need some deliverance.

(and this one day I met you and you took it all away)

I, no longer hate myself, for who I am, and the things I've done.
Jesus you're my deliverance.
Cause I, no longer hate myself, for who I am, and for the things I've done.
Jesus you're my deliverance.
oh, Jesus you're my deliverance.
You came down.
Jesus you're my deliverance.
Deliverance
