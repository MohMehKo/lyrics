God, I can't believe this is how
I'm going to go down
I've wasted my life without your guide
Now I'm crying out for You
Yea, Yea, Yea

So with my last breath, I'm gonna scream
Of my Savior's love for me
Now I'm reaching out, and I know that You
You are reaching out for me
Yea, Yea, Yea

If I'm gonna fall I will fall for you
Is this what you feel, is this what you felt
You love me in life I will love you in death
I'll see You in one moment's breath
One moment's breath

(Now some here)
Now some here would say to lie it away
And just hide the truth inside
But if I deny Him, then He denies me
And it's all over 
Again, yea, yea, yea

I drop to my knees, these demons telling me
That my death is all in vain
But I will not bow to them, I will walk over them
And they'll not defile me
Again, again, again

If I'm gonna fall I will fall for You
Is this what You feel is this what You felt
You love me in life I will love you in death
I'll see You in one moments breath
In one moment's breath

If I'm gonna fall I will fall for You
One moments breath
If I'm gonna fall I will fall for You
You and You alone

(Jesus, be with me)
If I'm gonna fall I will fall for You
For You and You alone
Is this what You feel is this what You felt
That day upon your cross
You love me in life I will love You in death
Love You in my death
I'll see you in one moment's breath
In one moments breath
