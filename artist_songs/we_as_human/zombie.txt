Pretty plastic bottles
Lay beside your bed
With every dose you swallow
You lose your head

(And how) is your heart still bleeding?
(Where) did the human go?
(Yeah) they might keep you breathing
(Oh) but they numb your soul

Oh, where did all your fire go?

You're on the inside
And I know you're fighting
On the outside
Your flesh is dying
But this is not your funeral
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up the zombie
So long over medicated
Thinking nothing's wrong
Cause you're so sedated
This is not your funeral
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up the zombie!
Wake up the zombie!

You started forgetting who you really are
I'm getting kinda worried
You've been gone so long
(And how) is your body sleeping?
(Where) did the human go?
Has it stopped the healing?
(Oh) Have you lost you control?

Oh, where did all your fire go?

You're on the inside
And I know you're fighting
On the outside
Your flesh is dying
But this is not your funeral
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up the zombie
So long over medicated
Thinking nothing's wrong
Cause you're so sedated
This is not your funeral
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up the zombie!
Wake up the zombie!

Pretty plastic bottles
Lay beside your bed
Overdose
Gonna lose your head
