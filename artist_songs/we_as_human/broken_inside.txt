I'm not ready yet
To say goodbye to you
So many things that I wanted to do
Like hold you close until you love me too

I don't understand
Just why you're letting go
I know you'd love me if you only knew
I am not a monster growing inside of you

Now I cry, broken inside
Now everything in my world seems wrong
Life is not a game
For boys and girls to play
And simply change the rules
When it don't turn out your way

What gives us the right
To end a child's life?
All your excuses can't remove the pain
That they feel when we decide to take their breath away

So just close your eyes
Pretend they're not alive
But all your lying can't destroy the truth
It's babies that we murder with our right to choose

Now I cry, broken inside
Now everything in my world seems wrong
Life is not a game
For boys and girls to play
And simply change the rules
When it don't turn out your way
