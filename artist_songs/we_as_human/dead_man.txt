This is it, this is where we make a stand
You and me, time to face this man to man
Can't you see we cannot go on
It's me against me again

I'm sick of the man I am within
Fighting me, making me fall down again
I commit, I'll commit your suicide
Now death will breath you in

Sitting here at my graveside I've never been so alive
You pulled the dead man out of me
I am not what I was, I'll never be what I was
You pulled the dead man out of me

I buried you, you where nearly my demise
It's only by the grace of God that I survived
I admit I was wrong to let you in
Never come back again

I can see all the possibilities rising up
Now that you're not pulling me down
This is where I say goodbye
And put the last bullet between your eyes

Sitting here at my graveside I've never been so alive
You pulled the dead man out of me
I am not what I was, I'll never be what I was
You pulled the dead man out of me

I am a dead man
I am a dead man

Sitting here at my graveside I've never been so alive
You pulled the dead man out of me
I am not what I was, I'll never be what I was
You pulled the dead man out of me

Sitting here at my graveside I've never been so alive
You pulled the dead man out of me
Dead man out of me
