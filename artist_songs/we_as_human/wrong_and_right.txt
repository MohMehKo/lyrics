In all these things
What would you say
We're all in a lie
Are rarely seen
Where lust and pride
Rule these nations streets
And people say
That what makes life sweet

But when we're wrong were right
When we're right were wrong
When will we learn?
When we're wrong we're right
When we're right we're wrong
When will we learn?
God, it's you we need

We live out lives
Living for ourselves
But the judge will come
And for some there's hell
We must learn to learn
We must learn to love
To put others first
And put God above it all

Cause when we're wrong were right
When we're right were wrong
When will we learn?
When we're wrong we're right
When we're right we're wrong
When will we learn?
God, it's you we need
It's you we need

We live our lives living this lie
We fill the emptiness inside
When will we learn
You want the truth? Lay down your pride
Don't look inside; that's who is a lie
Look to Jesus Christ

When we're wrong we're right
When we're right we're wrong
When will we learn?
Oh, God, when will we
When we're wrong we're right
When we're right we're wrong
When will we learn
Because when we're wrong, right
Right, wrong
When will we
Oh, God, when will we
When we're wrong we're right
When we're right, wrong
When will we learn
That God, it's you we need
