[Chorus:]
I turn my head to the right and there you are
With the smile upon your face
And all I could say is damn you're beautiful
I can't stop thinking about you,
Girl you're always on my mind
And all I could say is damn you're beautiful

Hey love, it's funny after all this time
Your touch still kinda blows my mind
Your hands must have been made in heaven,
In heaven baby
Your hips shake like a Spanish guitar
Your lips, they could be a work of art
I love the way you're put together, together

[Chorus:]
I turn my head to the right and there you are
With the smile upon your face
And all I could say is damn you're beautiful
I can't stop thinking about you,
Girl you're always on my mind
And all I could say is damn you're beautiful

You got me on permanent lock
I crave, your body around the clock
I plan to keep you here forever,
Forever baby
Cause those eyes tell me you're the only one
Your smile is harder than the morning sun
You're more and so perfectly for me
Beautiful

[Chorus:]
I turn my head to the right and there you are
With the smile upon your face
And all I could say is damn you're beautiful
I can't stop thinking about you,
Girl you're always on my mind
And all I could say is damn you're beautiful

[Pitbull:]
She's down for whatever, that's right
No matter the weather, she would
Do anything, just to, make me feel better
That's why, I owe her my loyalty
And treat her like royalty
Baby you on to me, and that's why I give you all of me
Let's look to the future, and laugh at the past
I'm in love with you, but obsessed with your ass
You know what I mean, I wake up to a dream
Every time I see you, damn you're beautiful

[Chorus:]
I turn my head to the right and there you are
With the smile upon your face
And all I could say is damn you're beautiful
I can't stop thinking about you,
Girl you're always on my mind
And all I could say is damn you're beautiful.
