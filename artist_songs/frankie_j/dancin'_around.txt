[Chorus:]
You got me feeling, that love is feeling 
You got me dancing around and around and around 
You got me feeling, that love is feeling 
You got me dancing around and around and around

I met a girl last night 
And I just don't wanna to be another number yeah 
That's something special in her eyes
Is that something that I wanna discover 
So I won't hesitate, hesitate 
I know what a girl make her mine 
And I wont' be afraid 
It's something that I feel inside 

[Chorus:]
Uuh I'm dancing around, you got me dancing around 
Uueooh I'm dancing around, you got me dancing around 

Head over hills and it feels unreal 
I don't have to hide it oh no no
I just want to be nasty you 
'cause you don't understand all the things that you do to me 
So I won't hesitate, hesitate 
I know what a girl make her mine 
And I wont' be afraid 
It's something that I feel inside 

[Chorus:]
Uueooh I'm dancing around, you got me dancing around 
Uueooh I'm dancing around, you got me dancing around 

[x2]
I feel so weak I cannot speak 
I feel a love spell coming down 

[Chorus (x2)]
