What if, what if
What if, what if
What if, what if
What if, what if
What if, what if

I know we were young but I still wonder
If we could go back into time
Would we still be in love with each other
If you would have changed your mind
So do you ever
Wonder what if
Wonder what if
If you never, never walked out on me
Would we still be, still be the way we were
Cause lately I've been wondering
But we know how the story ends yeah

What if, what if
We turn back the hands of time
What if, what if
To that unforgetful night
What if, what if
You were still standing there
Would you leave again
What if, what if
You and I could press rewind
What if, what if

What if, what if
I wouldn't have to
Would you leave again

I know, you know
We both have somebody
Now that we've moved on with our lives
But sometimes I think about the times we
Shared when it was you and I
So do you ever
Wonder what if
Wonder what if
If you never, never walked out on me
Would we still be, still be the way we were
Cause lately I've been wondering
But we know how the story ends ohhh

What if, what if
We turn back the hands of time
What if, what if
To that unforgetful night
What if, what if
You were still standing there
Would you leave again
What if, what if
You and I could press rewind
What if, what if

What if, what if
I wouldn't have to
Would you leave again

Do you ever wonder how it would be
Do you ever wonder
Do you ever wonder
Do you ever wonder how it would be
Do you ever wonder
Do you ever wonder

What if, what if
We turn back the hands of time
What if, what if
To that unforgetful night
What if, what if
You were still standing there
Would you leave again
What if, what if
You and I could press rewind
What if, what if

What if, what if
I wouldn't have to
Would you leave again

What if, what if...
