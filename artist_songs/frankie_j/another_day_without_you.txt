[Verse 1]
The writings on the wall say everything
Just how much I've been here waiting
And the hours of the clock keep ticking
I miss you even more
The absence of your love keeps killing me 
And it won't allow me to live properly 
Breaking every single piece of me 
I gotta pick myself up from the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
If only we could be the odds 
I know we'll stay in love forever 
If I could, I'd do it all over again 
But until then I'm gonna miss you babe

[Chorus]
I'm going on another day without you 
Guess this means I'll miss you once again 

I'm going on another day without you
Trying to find the strength but I have nothing left

I'm going on another day without you 
Guess this means I'll miss you once again

I'm going on another day without you 
I keep tossing, keep turning but I can't get you out of my head

[Verse 2]
Accepting that your gone ain't easy
I cannot forget the words that came out of me when I said don't leave me
I'm still here counting the seasons
When you ask me why I need you back I'm gon' give you all my reasons 
Baby please just know that I'm sorry
I beg of you to hear my crying
It's your heart that I am after 
I'm such a disaster
Can we give it one more try 

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x2]
