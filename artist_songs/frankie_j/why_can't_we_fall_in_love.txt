Why can’t we fall in love, why can’t we fall in love
Why can’t we fall in love
Why can’t we fall

We kissing and touching, and rubbing, and hugging
And fogging up the windows in my car
And we don’t know if we are 
We just parked outside, the liquor store
We never don’t know where to go
It’s 4 o’clock in the morning, but we don’t care at all

I love the way she tease me, she just wanna please me
Love the way she turn me on
I love it when she miss me, she be getting freaky
Makes me wanna get it on
It’s amazing what I’m feeling and I just can’t get enough
Her body’s all I’m needing and I can’t 
Wait to fall in love

Why can’t we fall in love, … stars
Open up your heart
My baby, why can’t we fall in love, …stars
Open up your heart, my baby
Why can’t we fall in love, why can’t we fall in love
Why can’t we fall in love, why can’t we fall in love
Why can’t we fall in love
Why don’t we ever start
Just open up your heart to me

Tell me you want me, you trust me, you got me
Speeding up the rhythm in my heart
It’s racing like a car
I want you to love me and never let go
The one thing your body keeps pulling me close

I love the way she tease me, she just wanna please me
Love the way she turn me on
I love it when she miss me, she be getting freaky
Makes me wanna get it on
It’s amazing what I’m feeling and I just can’t get enough
Her body’s all I’m needing and I can’t 
Wait to fall in love

Why can’t we fall in love, … stars
Open up your heart
My baby, why can’t we fall in love, …stars
Open up your heart, my baby
Why can’t we fall in love, why can’t we fall in love
Why can’t we fall in love, why can’t we fall in love
Why can’t we fall in love
Why don’t we ever start
Just open up your heart to me

Why can’t we fall in love, … stars
Open up your heart
My baby, why can’t we fall in love, …stars
Open up your heart, my baby
Why can’t we fall in love, why can’t we fall in love
Why can’t we fall in love, why can’t we fall in love
Why can’t we fall in love
Why don’t we ever start
Just open up your heart to me.
