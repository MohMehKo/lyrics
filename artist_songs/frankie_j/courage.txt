Just when you think you got hope, instead you start to lose it
And when you think you got time you start falling behind
You ask yourself could this be some kind of illusion
And then you pinch yourself, it's messin' with your mind
And then you start to find that the stress you hide reveals itself in your frustration
And then you question why is this heart of mine going through this complication

Just leave it all to him, 'cause he's in control
Trust in all he does, he's the one who knows
And he will never leave you in despair
He'll protect you with the power of a prayer

You gotta have courage, courage, courage, courage
So brother don't worry, worry, worry, worry
He's got your back and you know that he will never leave you behind
You gotta have courage, courage, courage, courage
So sister don't worry, worry, worry, worry
You gotta believe in his word, because he will never tell you no lie
You gotta have courage

Just when you think that the rain won't stop falling
You'll hear his voice, with your name he's calling
And all the pain and hurt will seize
And you'll know exactly what I mean
You'll get down on your knees and you'll start to believe
And begin worshipping his name
He's the king of kings, oh yeah he's the great I am
And then you'll start to find sunshine in your life
The reason for all his creations
And you'll realize all your questions "Why?"
Will disappear 'cause they'll be answered

Just leave it all to him, 'cause he's in control
Trust in all he does, he's the one who knows
And he will never leave you in despair
He'll protect you with the power of a prayer

You gotta have courage, courage, courage, courage
So brother don't worry, worry, worry, worry
He's got your back and you know that he will never leave you behind
You gotta have courage, courage, courage, courage
So sister don't worry, worry, worry, worry
You gotta believe in his word, because he will never tell you no lie
You gotta have courage
