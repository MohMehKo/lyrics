Now most men don’t think about this
And I know you don’t hear this much
And most men might act like … 
When they really don’t care as much
But you are the best things in our lives
And you are the sparkle in our eyes
And by far we both end satisfied
Girl I gotta confess, please don’t settle for less
Woman, woman, what kind of world would we live in
Without a woman
Would there be love and happiness, without a woman
How can I call myself a man, without a woman, 
That’s why my woman is everything to me
Woman, woman

Now I know you want appreciated, 
And they don’t treat you like I know we could
See Valentines ain’t the only day when
Love can be expressed the way it should
You are the best things in our lives
And you are the sparkle in our eyes

And by far we both end satisfied
Girl I gotta confess, please don’t settle for less
Woman, woman, what kind of world would we live in
Without a woman
Would there be love and happiness, without a woman
How can I call myself a man, without a woman, 
That’s why my woman is everything to me
Woman, woman
Without you, there wouldn’t be Adam and Eve or families
Without a woman, there would be no one
Willing to care me, live for me
Whoa, whoa, whoa, a woman
Woman, woman, woman, woman

What kind of world would we live in
Without a woman
Would there be love and happiness, without a woman
How can I call myself a man, without a woman, 
That’s why my woman is everything to me
Woman, woman [x2]
