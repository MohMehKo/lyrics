[Verse 1:]
Why you gotta treat her so bad, when you know she'll never ever treat like that, she's never gave you a reason she's caught you cheatin' still after it all has your back
(she's one in a million, 
how could it be once in a lifetime, 
you better treat her right or you ain't gunna find love) 
For her I would give anything I'll say it with all do respect, (why you gotta treat her like that?) 

[Chorus:]
Why do you treat her bad?,
Doesn't it make you sad?,
Doesn't it make you wonder what she might do?,
If I was in her shoes, I would be through with you I woulda left yo ass for some other dude,
Why do you treat her bad?, 
it's gunna make her mad,
She gon' be forced to do what she don't wanna do, 
She ain't tryna rush ya, she just wants to love ya,
Why do you treat her bad it's gunna rush her out the door..

[Verse 2:]
Your only diggin yourself up in a deeper hole, 
Not caring creating more problems than you'll ever know,
(your not thinkin' bout it,
You'd rather live without it,
You think your superman,
but you are an ass fall)
Well I got news for you, something you ought to know, she's leaving you for me, yes I'm that other dude, she calls me every single day and every  night, every single time that y'all fight, 

[Chorus:]
Why do you treat her bad?,
Doesn't it make you sad?,
Doesn't it make you wonder what she might do?,
If I was in her shoes, I would be through with you I woulda left yo ass for some other dude,
Why do you treat her bad?, 
it's gunna make her mad,
She gon' be forced to do what she don't wanna do, 
She ain't tryna rush ya, she just wants to love ya,
Why do you treat her bad it's gunna rush her out the door..
(Why you gotta treat her?)
(why you gotta treat her so bad?)

[Verse 3:]
It's your turn to feel every single thing you've earned, now that you can cross the bridge, you've learned that you just a little too late learning from your own mistakes,
(why'd you have to treat her bad?)

[Chorus:]
Why do you treat her bad?,
Doesn't it make you sad?,
Doesn't it make you wonder what she might do?,
If I was in her shoes, I would be through with you I woulda left yo ass for some other dude,
Why do you treat her bad?, 
it's gunna make her mad,
She gon' be forced to do what she don't wanna do, 
She ain't tryna rush ya, she just wants to love ya,
Why do you treat her bad it's gunna rush her out the door..
(Why you gotta treat her?) 
(why you gotta treat her so bad?)
