You're so scared of falling in love.
'Cause you end up in the dust, every time ... 
EVERY TIME!
Now you see us all the same.
Like our words are just a game, spitting lies... 
DIRTY LIES!

[CHORUS]
I know, you know there's something here.
But you cannot get past the fear.
I can help you make it clear.

So when you feel like trying again...
Reach out, take my hand!
See how great it could be...
to fall in love, With someone you can trust
Who will never give up! 
Cause your all that he needs!

Baby take a chance on me!
Baby take a chance on me!
Baby take a chance on me!
Baby take a chance on me!

You give 100 percent.
but you've never seen a cent.
They're so blind... THEY'RE SO BLIND!!
Cause I'm looking at your face
And the worlds a better place
in your eyes... LONELY EYES!

[CHORUS]
I know, you know there's something here.
But you cannot get past the fear.
I can help you make it clear.

So when you feel like trying again...
Reach out, take my hand!
See how great it could be...
to fall in love, With someone you can trust
Who will never give up! 
Cause your all that he needs!

Baby take a chance on me!
Baby take a chance on me!
Baby take a chance on me!
Baby take a chance on me!

You've got nothing to lose ...BABY!
But you wont know if you don't try.
Just don't leave me asking why.
So when your ready to choose, BABY..
ill be here with open arms
with the same love in my.. HEART!!!!

[CHORUS]
I know, you know there's something here.
But you cannot get past the fear.
I can help you make it clear.

So when you feel like trying again...
Reach out, take my hand!
See how great it could be...
to fall in love, With someone you can trust
Who will never give up! 
Cause your all that he needs!

Baby take a chance on me!
Baby take a chance on me!
Baby take a chance on me!
Baby take a chance on me!
