Move your body, body like a flag
Move your body, body like a flag

Super two, this love is around the world
Tonight it's me and you
So let's go, we've only got now, so girl
Let me show you what to do

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Dancing under the stars
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Miami to Katar
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Move wherever you are
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Moving like that!

Move your body, body like a flag
Baila, baila conmigo tonight
Move your body, body like a flag
Gonna dance for the rest of my life

One more chance, I'm holding you close tonight
We might get just one chance
To live free, your body just feels so right
But baby give it up to me

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Dancing under the stars
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Miami to Katar
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Move wherever you are
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Moving like that!

Move your body, body like a flag
Baila, baila conmigo tonight
Move your body, body like a flag
Gonna dance for the rest of my life

Moving like that!
Moving like that!

Move your body, body
Move your body, body
Move your body, body like a flag
Baila, baila conmigo tonight
Moving like that!

Moving like that!
