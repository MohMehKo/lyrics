I promise that you'll never be alone
This house will always be your home
And our hearts will always beat as one
As long as I can breathe I swear
I promise that I will never let you down
Be strong for you, I'll always be around
Look into my eyes you'll see that we were meant to be together (oh)
This love of ours was sent from up above
Together I know that we could touch the sky
Nothing ever felt so right
Girl I...

This I promise you, this I promise you, this I promise you
(Girl I'll be there) I will be there (I will be there) I will be there
This I promise you, this I promise you, this I promise you
(Girl I'll be there) I will be there (I will be there)
I promise all my life

There's something that you really gotta know
I'm with you til the end of the road (end of the road)
I'll never let you go
I swear I've never felt like this before
Cause everyday I love you more and more
You lift me up so high, I look into your eyes I see forever
This love of ours was sent from up above
Together I know that we could touch the sky
Nothing ever felt so right
Girl I, I, I...

This I promise you, this I promise you, this I promise you
(Girl I'll be there) oh I'll be there (I will be there) oh I'll be there
I promise my time (this I promise you),
I promise my heart (this I promise you),
I promise my love (this I promise you)
Girl I'll be there, girl I'll be there

Through the fire we could hold each other up
I'll be your shelter cause the storms are gonna come
So don't worry anymore
Cause this is no ordinary love
And this I promise

This I promise you, this I promise you, this I promise you
(Girl I'll be there) I promise baby (I will be there) I will be there
I promise my time (this I promise you),
I promise my heart (this I promise you),
I promise my love (this I promise you)
(Girl I'll be there) I'll be there (I will be there) I will be there

This I promise you, this I promise you, this I promise you
(Girl I'll be there) I'll be there (I will be there) I'll be there
I promise my time (this I promise you),
I promise my heart (this I promise you),
I promise my love (this I promise you)
(Girl I'll be there) I will be right there (I will be there)
I promise all my life
Oh baby baby baby baby baby this I promise you
