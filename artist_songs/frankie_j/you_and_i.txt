[Verse 1]
I remember back in Grade school 
When I was trying to date you 
Love tops back and forth 
And ooh I used to hate you 
My name, your name, sitting in a tree 
Riding home on the school bus 
You sitting next to me 
It was summer vacation playing hide and go get it 
Now you're telling me to wait, baby I don't get it 
Yes, no or maybe so tell me if you with it 
Got a big stick from the ice cream truck 
You wanna split it? 
Like a clear back pack 
Girl I see right through you 
The feelings that you have 
You couldn't measure with a ruler 
Control, reset, I got the boot like a computer 
Got my head hanging down while I'm riding on my scooter 
Part one of the saga - People asking what's gonna happen 
I ain't much for fortune telling so I'm just gonna stick to rapping 
Pretty sure/planning short that's what I'm here to do 
Cause baby like the letter 'Q' 
?
The first thing I need is 'U' 

[Chorus]
Every night 
I ask myself 
How we got here 
I'm afraid to close my eyes 
Cause it's not clear 
What the future holds 

[Verse 2]
? in school I'm missing you and being in the same class 
On the way to the office 
Teacher can I get the same pass 
First time we really kissed 
First time we really kissed 
I don't know what happened 
Something hit me like a ton of bricks 
Share the same feelings 
Even share the same locker 
If I try to take it further 
That would be improper 
Apply a little pressure 
Tell her everybody's doing it 
But I don't wanna stress her 
Cause that just might ruin it 

[Chorus]
Every night 
I ask myself 
How we got here 
I'm afraid to close my eyes 
Cause it's not clear 
What the future holds 

[Verse 3]
Prom night picture taken 
Smoothe like figure skating 
Not just my imagination 
So close to graduation 
And we applied to all the same schools 
And after all this time I abided by the rules 
So tonight'll be the night 
We throw caution to the wind 
Damn ? broken inside 
But all my friends 
Can't believe that we did it 
I admit it, it was worth the wait 
We're soul mates 
At the right time and at the perfect place 

[Verse 4]
Now it's off to college 
And I promise it gets better 
Everything we need to learn 
Won't be taught by the professor 
The campus is so big 
It's like a whole another world 
Now you're nervous cause you're noticing 
All these other girls 
I'm just tryna reassure you 
That no I ain't cheating 
I'm just wrestling with my feelings like why we ?debating? this 
So I'm jumping out the radar put a ring on your finger 
? Girl I'll let you make the college 
Will you turn back on the ringer ?

[Chorus]
Every night 
I ask myself 
How we got here 
I'm afraid to close my eyes 
Cause it's not clear 
What the future holds
