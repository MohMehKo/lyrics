Woke up that morning, feeling so out of place.
Realized something was missing, it just wasn't my day.
Let alone my intuition, saying she's going away.
I get the chills thinking about it, maybe everything's okay.

And then the call came in, and her best friend said,
A train was leaving that night, she said you better hurry up, go on and catch a cab,
Hope you get there on time, I couldn't waste another minute,
I ran as fast as I could, feeling scared and agitated,
I turned around and there you stood.

And I had you there,
And you looked so beautiful,
Had to build the nerve and find a way to let you know,
I love you so.
And I had you there,
How could I let the moment go.
Had to put my arms around you and let you know,
Once and for all...

It felt so lonely on the right side of the bed.
Felt so cold under the covers, you weren't laying on my left.
Minutes turning into hours, and the hours turn to days.
Going crazy here without you, as the longer I wait.

Once and for all...

Baby please... You don't have to go.
