Butterflies, in my stomach
Every time I feel you coming
I can’t deny, what I feel inside
But this time you have won
This heart of my heart
You convinced me to never leave
Again you made me believe
Uncovered my eyes to see
And now I’m on my knees

When love rings your bell
You better answer the door,
Don’t leave it go home
When love reach your bell
You better open the door 
And don’t let it go home
When love rings your bell
You better answer the door,
Don’t leave it go home
When love rings your bell
Receive well, 
Before it don’t come back no more

Time and time, I can’t done running
I didn’t care, I didn’t wanted
But something changed, the day you came
You gave me another chance
Another try
Well you convinced me to never leave 
Again you made me believe
And you uncovered my eyes to see 
And now I’m on my knees

When love rings your bell
You better answer the door,
Don’t leave it go home
When love reach your bell
You better open the door 
And don’t let it go home
When love rings your bell
You better answer the door,
Don’t leave it go home
When love rings your bell
Receive it well, 
Before it don’t come back no more

Now where you wanna be?
If you never came and rescued me
Love was true to me
I wanna thank you for bringing my baby

When love rings your bell
You better answer the door,
Don’t leave it go home
When love reach your bell
You better open the door 
And don’t let it go home
When love rings your bell
You better answer the door,
Don’t leave it go home
When love rings your bell
Receive it well, 
Before it don’t come back no more.
