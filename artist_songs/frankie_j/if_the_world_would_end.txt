I woke up this morning with this question on my mind
What if we were running out of time?
And the world was ending
All my working moments came flashing before my eyes
And ll I could think was what's the use of overtime
Why? Why didn't I do this? Why didn't I do that?
Why couldn't I go home when I had the chance?
Spend more time on building you and me
Turning moments into memories

If I would of spent more time on you
A wise investment paid in dividends through and through
And I would be so rich in love with you
There'll be no regrets about money I can't spend
I wouldn't care if the world ends

I called in sick this morning because I made up my mind
Had to catch up because I was so far behind
Could of made a minute
So I bought a dozen roses and brought breakfast to the bed
Kissed the lips upon your pretty sleepy head
I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna do that
Make the best of moments we've never had
Laughing to the brink of you and me
Filling it up with loving memories

Cause now I'm gonna spend more time on you
A wise investment paid in dividends through and through
I would be so rich in love with you
There'll be no regrets about money I can't spend
I wouldn't care if the world ends

I'ma put you first in line
And let our love age like fine wine
And watch it keep getting better with time
So I'ma give you mine

So I'm gonna spend more time on you
A wise investment paid in dividends through and through
I would be so rich in love with you
There'll be no regrets about money I can't spend
I wouldn't care if the world ends

I wouldn't care if the world would end
I wouldn't care if the world would end
I wouldn't care if the world would end
I wouldn't care, no I wouldn't care
Cause I know you'll be there
