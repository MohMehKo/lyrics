Never feel alone 
Never feel there's no one there who cares for you 
When every door seems closed 
Mine is open wide for you 

I'll give you strength 
Restore your faith 
Im the one who'll be around if it all falls down 
I will hold you 

[Chorus] 
I'll be there if you break 
I'll be there if you crumble 
Come to you if you come undone 
Catch you if you stumble 
I'll do what it takes to put the pieces back in place 
If you break 

Never feel ashamed 
Never feel that it's weak if you should reach for me 
When your chained by the pain 
I'll be there to set you free 

I'll give you love 
I'll lift you up 
I'm the one who'll be around if it all falls down 
I will hold you 

I'll be there if you break 
I'll be there if you crumble 
Come to you if you come undone 
Catch you if you stumble 
I'll do what it takes to put the pieces back in place 
If you break 

But if there comes a time when I might need someone 
Will you be there? 
Say you'll be there 

Be there if I break 
Be there if I crumble 
Come to me if I come undone 
Catch me if I stumble 
I'll do what it takes to put the pieces back in place 
If you break 

I'll be there if you crumble 
Come to you if you come undone 
Catch you if you stumble 
I'll do what it takes to put the pieces back in place 
If you break 
If you break 
If you break
