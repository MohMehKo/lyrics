I noticed the change in my life since you walked away
I noticed the tears and the pain have been brushed away
I noticed my worries are gone and it's brought a relief to my heart
I noticed my days and my nights have a sudden change
I'm able to breathe without having to suffocate
I'm everything that I've ever wanted to be

I'm happy to say that now I'm stronger
I've managed to start a brand new life
I don't need you any longer
'Cause I'm doin' just fine

I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I'm better livin' without you
(Livin' without you)
Why would you think I would give up my life all because of you
I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I'm better livin' without you
(Livin' without you)
Don't try to come back around 'cause I've already found someone new
I'm not alone

Everybody seems to notice it
I'm walkin' and talkin', livin' with no regrets
I'm not the same person I was before you met me
Don't you come at me for a second chance
There's no way I can ever forget the past
I won't accept your invitation 'cause my heart's been taken

Now
I'm happy to say that now I'm stronger
I've managed to start a brand new life
I don't need you any longer
'Cause I'm doin' just fine

I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I'm better livin' without you
(Livin' without you)
Why would you think I would give up my life all because of you
I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I'm better livin' without you
(Livin' without you)
Don't try to come back around 'cause I've already found someone new
I'm not alone

Don't go wastin' our time
Go and find your own life
We don't need to live with the strife
It's just best that you go

I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I'm better livin' without you
(Livin' without you)
Why would you think I would give up my life all because of you
I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I'm better livin' without you
(Livin' without you)
Don't try to come back around 'cause I've already found someone new
I'm not alone
