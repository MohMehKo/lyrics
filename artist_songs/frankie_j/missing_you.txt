Hello, this is Frankie J and on November 19, 2008, we’ve lost an angel.
This is for her!

Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Since you went away, we’ve been down and lonely,
Since you've been away, we’ve been thinking of you!
Trying to understand the reason you left us, 
Now we are here this noon.

[Chorus:]
Uhuuuuu
We’re missing you!
Tell me where the road turns.
Uhuuuuu
We’re missing you!
Tell me where the road turns.
Uhuuuuu, ohhhhh, yea!

As we look around, we see things that remind us 
Just to see your smile, made my heart fill with joy!
We still recall all those dreams we shared together,
When did you run to now?

[Chorus:]
Uhuuuuu
We’re missing you!
Tell me where the road turns.
Uhuuuuu
We’re missing you!
Tell me where the road turns.
Uhuuuuu, ohhhhh, yea!

We’re missing you forever and ever!
We’re missing you forever and ever!
We’re missing you, hey!
