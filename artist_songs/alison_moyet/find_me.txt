Is your heart so heavy
That it weighs you down
So all you have is time
Don't turn away
We have both seen darker days
And there's always a light that shines

(Do you feel like) all your hopes are a long way gone
(Does it seem like) every road only takes you down
(Do they shut you out)
Don't be afraid of what they say
Throw back your head and cry

When you need somebody, find me there
When you're feeling empty I'll be there - find me

When you're feeling weary with no peace of mind
And the tone of your voice is hollow
You're home to stranger that won't belong
And there's no-one else to follow

(Do you feel like) nowhere, oh no, there's no better way
(Does it seem like) nobody hears a word you say
(And they shut you out)
And where does it say that a man ain't a right
To throw back his head and cry

You don't need to tell me 'cos I know
I know how you feel (you're miles away)
You don't need to show me (nobody listens to a word you say)
We can shut them out
Where does it say that a man ain't a right
To throw back his head and cry

When you need somebody find me there
I'll be right beside you
When you're feeling empty I'll be there
Can you hear me? I'll be singing
