Ours was the best September
Of blue and gold it was
Of aching nights
And sleep-all days
I made my way to meet you
By then the air had changed
And you had seen me everywhere and they sparkled
And shined like new
Like you said I used to
Another magic day is lost on you
And all the love falls through your fingers
Another living day is lost and gone on you

One night you took me driving
You coloured everyone in shades that I'd never seen
You said someone had left you
You'd tried your very best
(What silver clouded eyes see)
Saying stay when leaving me
When I'm all that you need
Another magic day is lost on you
And all the love falls through your fingers
Another living day is lost and gone on you

If you could feel it now
Warmer than magenta skies
My spirits burning just like the blazing cheeks on the face
Of a young child
And it's wild

Another magic day is lost on you
(What a day another living day)
