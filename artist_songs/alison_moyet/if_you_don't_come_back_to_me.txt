If you don't come back to me
You'll have saved me goodbyes
My escape would be neat
I won't lose a minute's sleep
Recovering what we made and meant not to keep
Life is Sweet
Can it fail to astound me
How it surrounds me
And I won't steal to breathe
If you never came back to me

If you don't come back to me
I won't measure by you every man that I see
When next by chance we meet
I'll pass you by and not care if you're watching me
Life is Sweet
How it spins me around
Something's lost, something's found
And I won't hit the ground
If you never came back to me

Can it fail to astound me
How it surrounds me
And I won't steal to breathe
If you never came back to me
