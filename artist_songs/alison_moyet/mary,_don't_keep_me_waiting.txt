Mary Mary don't keep me waiting
There's not light enough to see and you know
If I'm not there when he gets back home
He's going to come out looking for me

Don't take what you can't carry
Don't keep what you don't need
Full speed please Mary won't you hurry back
The sky is black and it's menacing me

Mary did you change your motor car
You're just to far away to see

Mary Mary don't keep me waiting
There's not air enough to breathe and you know
If I'm not there when he gets back home
He's going to come out looking for me

Tell no-one where you're going
Speak not one word of me
Mary please believe me, I,
I tell no lie
I have an eye for some troublesome things

Mary did you come alone now
I'm just too far away to see

Big tree won't you be my cradle
Rock me but don't let me sleep
Keep me secret if you're able to
'Til Mary comes I'm counting on you

Mary are the headlights blinking there
I'm just too far away to see
