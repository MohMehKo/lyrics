She told me today I'm in your way
She says your heading somewhere
You've a long way to go
Even more than she knows
She thinks you're half the way there
You've learnt nothing much at all
No doubt you told her that you stayed with me through pity
Honorable you
Oh go away
Make it easy on yourself
Tell them I let you down
I'm not the girl you met oh no
And if I smile just a little
Forgive me but I've read that book as well
And I know. You know

Oh now I'm so intrigued
Your life's such a read
It must be torture for you
Unlike one such as me
You know all that I need is to pick up after you
You don't understand at all
You move amongst us like some alien higher being
Skimming no plane but yours

So go away
Make it easy on yourself
Tell them I'm off my head
I keep you from yourself
And I can't help but smile a little
Remembering all you choose to forget
And I know

You know that I still feel the world revolving miles beneath my feet
You and I were hapless space cadets
Mirrored when we meet
When I was coming down you let me fall alone
Now I think that you've been up too long

You've learnt nothing much at all
You move amongst us like some alien higher being
Seeing no pain but yours

Oh go away
Make it easy on yourself
Tell them I let you down
I'm not the girl you met oh no
And if I smile just a little
Forgive me but I've read that book as well
And I know. You know
