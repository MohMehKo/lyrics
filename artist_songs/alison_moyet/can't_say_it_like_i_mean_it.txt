It's easier to forgive someone for
being wrong
Than for being right, isn't it?
And how your angry tears will fall when
all your plans
Don't suit the one you made them for
It comes to this.
It's easier forgetting how you got to shore
When every cloud that blows your way
Is something else to blame me for

Say it like you feel it
You can't say it like you feel it anymore
Say it like I mean it
I can't say it like I mean it anymore

Hold it up to the light, it looks like love
It's what the mirror says
You name it so
But you cut your pretty shapes as
paper flakes
From careful sheets
They blow away
Not made to keep
What if alteration makes a little lie?
When what you paint instead is easier
on the eye
Than what you hide

Say it like you feel it
You don't say it like you feel it anymore
Say it like I mean it
I can't say it like I mean it anymore
Not anymore

There are people who you think you're
gonna love forever
Oh when you should know better
You should know better
Some people only see you
As a move they're making
Another step they're taking
A bet they're staking
There are people who you think
You're gonna love forever
You're gonna stay together
You should know better
Some people don't forgive you
What you give up freely
or that you found it easy
They want to own completely.
There are people who you think you're
gonna love forever
Oh when you should know better
You should know better...
