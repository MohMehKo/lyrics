Do you ever wonder
What it's like
To be alone and
No sleep at night
Ever wonder
Is this for real
Ever Wonder

Sometimes I think you sigh
Time drifts by, once in a life
Love is strong

I won't feel anything
I'm lost without you

In my mind a picture
That you frame
Kaleidoscope of love you're showing me
Loving sweet rays
All hopes that fade
My only gain
My lonely game played without you

You sigh
Time drifts by, once in a life 
Love is strong

I won't feel anything
I'm lost without you

Through the wake of you 
Every now and then
Every now and then
The road that I follow is so far from you

Do you every wonder
