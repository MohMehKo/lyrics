Do you keep for a relic
Every ticket in your pocket
For a time you need reminding of
The webbing and the binding

Will you cherish every barb that caught you
Soft and unprotected
Like a souvenir collected of
The harrow and the hiding

You are more in the sum
Of the numbers you’ve been done
And it fits to be kind
Even as your chest is bleeding

And May love reign supreme in your heart

Hold on to what you know
You light the room, you give it all
Take with you when you go
The smile that you’ve been sketching on my face

And if you slip again the nearest room is when you do
And as you slip away I’m waiting to here for everything to change

Will you write me a card
When you reached your destination
I won’t take it as a white flag or a
Sign of hesitation

Just a temporary token
I’ll be keeping in my pocket
With the biro and lighter til it
Smacks of desperation

We are more in the sum
Of the numbers we’ve been done
And it right to be kind
Even as your chest is bleeding

When the love reign supreme in your heart
Make love reign supreme in your heart

Hold on to what you know
You light the room, you give it all
Take with you when you go
The smile that you’ve been sketching on my face

And if you slip again the nearest room is when you do
And as you slip away I’m waiting to here for everything to change

And if you slip again the nearest room is when you do
And as you slip away I’m waiting to here for everything to change
