When I was your girl
I didn't know that I would
End where you begin
More beautiful in your skin
No matter of regret
This loosening curl
Teasing you out
When I was your girl

In my room you said we'll stay here for an endless year
Close the door we're letting no one near
When I was your girl
When I was your girl

And then today
All the nightmares came my way
All the tears I tried to stay
You were never satisfied
When I was your girl
When I was your girl

And when I was she
I'd put on every coat
To wear the weather down
But even in the sun
You said you tasted rain
I watched you unfurl
You held on to me
When I was your girl

In my cups I see you watching from the edge of the bed
I'm sinking words that you never said
When I was your girl
When I was your girl

And then today
I'll be keeping out your way
Every debt they owe I pay
They were never satisfied
When I was your girl
When I was your girl

We tore out a page
Impolitely quit the stage
Into corners sweep our rage
I would never leave you crying

When I was your girl
When I was your girl
When I was your girl
