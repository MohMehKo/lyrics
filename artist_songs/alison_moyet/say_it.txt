I have come to a time
When I must really decide
Love you gave so complete
I want you back

Hear me when I call
Hold me like before
Play the changing forms
Into sleep we fall
And we wake to love adored
Tell me that it's so
When I look at you
Through the eyes of love

And I'm missing you
Say you miss me too
Say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it,
Say it, say it

Everything feels right
Tenderness invites
Love you gave so complete
I want you back

Hear me when I call
Hold me like before
Play the changing forms
Into sleep we fall

And I'm missing you
Say you miss me too
Say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it,
Say it, say it
