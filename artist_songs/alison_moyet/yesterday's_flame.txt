You want to wipe some space
Onto the mirror for your face
To get somebody coming back at you
Lonely lonely lonelyâ€¦and nothing's coming through

If your heart isn't in it
Pull away and start again
If your heart isn't in it
Pull away and start again
Wait 'til you're ready
Wait 'til you know
Then you find yourself wondering
What the waiting is for
If your heart isn't in it
Pull away and start again

If your fire isn't taking
Stamp it out and light again
If your fire isn't taking
Stamp it out and light again
Here cos you're in it
Stay for a while
But you look in the mirror
For the spark in your eye
If your fire isn't taking
Kick it out and light again

If your heart isn't in it
Pull away and love again
If your heart isn't in it
Pull away and love again
Stay cos it's easy
Stay cos it's here
But you stay for a minute
Then you stay for a year
If your heart isn't in it
Pull away and love again

I guarantee it, you're gonna feel it
No frown and no shame now
Nothing's cold as yesterday's flame
