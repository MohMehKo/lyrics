Gone, simple days
Single ways to run
Tripping over the rubble of new roads begun
And I'd follow you then, like a dog at your heel
Wishing only to borrow the freedoms you'd steal

I turned back as the crowd enveloped you
Scarlet finery
Oh just look at you now
Oh, just look at you now.

How is the truth so distracted,
When love sports its favours like medals
And takes well enough,
You gave to me selflessly, sinew and bone
Grown bigger than you who yet carries me home

Hair still black, and your back is steel
With your every word tasted
Oh, just look at you now
Oh, just look at you now.

I used to dance to the drum in your chest
My feet on your feet, my head at your breast
You gave me a tune and I carry it still
And i promise my darling,
That I ever will.

I turned back as the crowd enveloped you
Scarlet finery
Oh just look at you now
Oh, just look at you now
and I can't look at you now.
