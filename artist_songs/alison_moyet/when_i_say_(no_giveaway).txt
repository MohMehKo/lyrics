Should I be seen with you one more time
My life is really on the line
His sister said she caught me out
If this gets back I'm dead without a doubt 
Try to ignore me each time we meet
Don't ever stop me in the street
He thinks I'm at the launder mat
I cant stay here he wants his washing back

So when I say - that I don't know your face
Don't feign surprise; don't betray me with your eyes
When I say - that you are out of place
Don't let them see, what you really are to me

Before this trouble blows sky-high
I have to find myself an alibi

Why do you have to get so uptight?
There's no need to be so impolite
Just give me back my negatives 
And I wont tell your wife about last night

So when I say - that I don't know your face
Don't feign surprise; don't betray me with your eyes
When I say - that you are out of place
Don't let them see, what you really are to me
