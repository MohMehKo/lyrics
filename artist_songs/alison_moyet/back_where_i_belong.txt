Have no faith
Believe me, don't believe in me
I'm gonna let you down 
You make it so very easy
He's waiting for me
That's the way I ever want it to be
It's always been the same
Yes it has, do you see. Wanna be where I belong

I belong
What am I supposed to do?
If he were there I wouldn't be with you
And you know the time is wrong
I'm going home back where I belong

You cant loose what you don't have
Making waves wont keep mine from me
I was lonely and there you were
Don't think he's hiding in the backroom
He knows with a wave of his hand
(On my way) you'll be out and I
(On my way) I'll be on my way
(On my way) back where I belong

I belong
If he were there I wouldn't be with you
And you know that it's all I have
I'm telling you baby I can't stop now

He's waiting for me
I gotta go 'cos
I feel his hand
Reminds me how ain't no use in having any other man
