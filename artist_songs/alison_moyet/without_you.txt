I never meant to got his far
I take back every word I said
Blame it on the weather
Tell me that I'm soft in the head
I never think before I speak
C'mon let's start this day anew
I never meant to do this
I never meant to hurt you - 
You and I should not be fighting
Life's too short for citing misdemeanors
Couldn't we just laugh about it
Do we have to let it come between us

I never meant to got this far
I don't believe what I just said
I had one drink to many
I think it's time I went to bed
Tell me that we are on TV
Tell me that none of this is true
Why have you packed my cases
Who said that I was leaving -

You and I should not be fighting
Life's too short for citing misdemeanors
Couldn't we just laugh about it
Do we have to let it come between us

It's time that we both faced the fact
I'm not begging to come back
I don't believe you'd want me to
I know that I'm not good enough
I never will deserve your love
But you haven't hear me through

I can't do... without you
