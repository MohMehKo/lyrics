Behold the city rocks
And what you really want
Won't stay with you

Oh how the shifting light
Once clean, precise
Conspires now to play with you

Dust falls on everyone
Our innocence with time all rearranged
Two hearts beat on
Dismayed to find their rhythm so
estranged, oh

I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire with you

Today I walk familiar lanes
'neath stone and spire where
nothings changed
But space and time

And if you tread your step the same
choose this hour, this day
Feel your hand for mine

Ours was a cruel exchange
Staying whole or being me and you
Forget, or find a way
To cut a hole that only we pass through

I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire with you

Dust falls on everyone
Our innocence with time all rearranged
Two hearts beat on
Dismayed to find their rhythm so
estranged, oh

I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire with you
