It's the stain on the moon
It's your idiot name
It's the noise in the noise
The gift of the game
It's the fruit that we bear
The peach that I bore
It's you and it's me and it should have been more

It's the choice that I made
It's the maid that you chose
It's the slip in the slide
From fingers to toes
It's the song of out there
The pull of the door
It's you and it's me and it should have been more

What if I could say now, what if I could say
Everything I meant now, everything

It's only hours, only days
Sat in Libra's Bowl, where it's all, it's all, it's all
It's all, balancing

It's the black in the grate
The smoke in the sink
It's the ether that you and I 
Opted to drink
It's the tooth that was chipped
On the first ever kiss
It's you and it's me and that's what it is
