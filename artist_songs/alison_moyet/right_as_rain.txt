If you can't be happy with me
Be unhappy with me
Stay unhappy with me
If you can't find peace in my arms
Find disease in my arms
As you please in my arms

Go, I'll fight you every step of the way
Know, that nothing now will be the same
As right as rain

If you feel like nothing with me
And see nothing in me
Then be nothing with me
If you can't find rest in my bed
Then don't bother your head
Lie awake there instead

Oh and may you never sleep again
Sow and may you never reap again
As right as rain

Takes one to make you suffer
One to leave you on your own
Takes one to make you suffer
And one to leave you on your own

It's a sad-sack affair
And you want it
You want it
You want it
It's a loud life out there
But you hear yourself speak
When you're on it
And before I don't care...

If you can't be happy with me
Be unhappy with me
Stay unhappy with me
