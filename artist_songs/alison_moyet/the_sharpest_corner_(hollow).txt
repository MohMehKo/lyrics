Liar, lie you lie,
Time and again, and why?
No want will make it true.
The only road to clip my heel,
Is spinning like a wheel
And we are crashing over
The sharpest corner ever turned.

Cry, you cry, you cry,
There's no good in goodbye
When you can't wish me well.
The only smile that lights your face,
Is raised from my disgrace,
There is no getting over
The sharpest corner ever turned.

So, no.
No love me, love me, love.
Hollow, Hollow
And no.
No take me, take me in.
Hollow, Hollow.

Forgive, forgive, forgive
I know the way you live,
The shadow that you throw
Dream the dream the dreamer dreams
Who never goes to sea
Who's never sailing over
The sharpest corner ever turned.

So no,
No love me, love me, love.
Hollow, Hollow
And no.
No take me, take me in.
Hollow, Hollow.
