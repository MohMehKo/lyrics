There's a train in that bell
Be still I won't hear it if you can
We could let it go

Sweet lie
I'll buy anything from you
We try tongue tied anything will do

On a simple whim no sense
We're all innocence and beer
Find a plastic cup and fall in
No one's ever going to hear

Don't ask me why
a seeing I
gives precedence to fools

There is flight in the sky
Close your eyes
Don't go higher than I am
Did we mean it all?
Don't mind
We'll just use the words we can
