You got me wrong this time
Is there somethin' I should know?
It would help if you'd explain what's goin' on?
Would you help me understand?
Just what it is that you accuse me of?

'Cos from the moment that I wake up
You're watchin' every move I make
You got me wrong this time
You got me wrong
You got me wrong this time
You got me wrong

Has this foolishness a name, who?
Do I have to guess until I get it right?
And can anybody play?
Is there a limit on the floor tonight?
Because if you have no objections
I'll get someone to take my place

You got me wrong this time
You got me wrong
You got me wrong this time
You got me wrong

And you will never know for sure, who
I had stashed behind the bathroom door
I know it's hard to be right
But you'll never be wrong anymore

Has this foolishness a name
Keep it to yourself
No hear, no see, no speak
Nothin's all you need to know

You got me wrong
You got me wrong this time
You got me wrong
You got me wrong this time
You got me wrong
You got me wrong this time

And you will never know for sure who
I had stashed behind the bathroom door
I know it's hard to be right
But you'll never be wrong anymore

You got me wrong
You got me wrong
You got me wrong
