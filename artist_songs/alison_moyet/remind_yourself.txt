Remind yourself
Of the little signs
And the small asides
Playing on your mind
Shift of air
The turn of phrase
Obsession to
Averted gaze
Remind yourself
How the field is wide
And the eye takes more than it sweeps aside
Choose to keep or select the shelf
Is a tender lie
Remind yourself

Remind yourself as the moon shifts overhead
That roll it does
Roll it does
And the drum beat in your chest
It becomes a pulse
It becomes

Remind yourself of a wiser day
When you let them come
But wouldn't let them stay
Gave them hope and
Forgot your own
Took your head to town
And your body home
When you told yourself
That you couldn't have
And you wouldn't feel
And it wasn't bad
When you know the truth matters
Nothing less
They will lie to you
Remind yourself

Remind yourself as the moon shifts overhead
That roll it does
Roll it does
And the drum beat in your chest
It becomes a pulse
Becomes
As the moon shifts overhea
Roll it does
Roll

Remind yourself
When you say goodbye
They'll forget today
And forget the tie
And somebody else
Is gonna fill the cup
That they say no one but you
Filled up
Remind yourself
The heart that pleads
Very soon takes care
Of its own needs
The greatest love
Is dealt and done
Remind yourself
And move along

Move along
