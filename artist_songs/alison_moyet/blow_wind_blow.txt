Don't cry
Please don't cry
I will take you somewhere
Where they cant hurt you
I wont let them hurt you now
Let them know that our love knows no shame
And we'll do it time and time and time again
'Till everything comes down

I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
Blow wind blow
Blow dust into their eyes and 
Make them see that they have always been blind

Touch me 
I want to wrap you in my arms and 
you'll have no reason for crying
Blow wind blow
Blow wind blow
Blow dust into their eyes and help them 
realise that they have always been blind
And I could show you something that you would never believe
You could never conceive the joy that I could give you

Take me
Take me
Blow wind blow
Blow wind blow
Blow wind blow dust into their eyes and 
let them know that nothing that we do will ever
Never be forgotten

Blow wind blow
Blow
Blow
Blow wind blow
