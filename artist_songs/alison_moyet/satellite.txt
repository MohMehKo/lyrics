You were alight and I wouldn't look away
You said I was sky and caught me anyway
How could I ever know you burn all that you hold
Now sing to the walls
I've cared more
I want to go, I want to stay, I want your name
And I want nothing that you are
Not even when you're moving me
(And you're moving me)
I want to talk, I want to sleep
Want to get up and wash the rest of you away
You never had me
Satellite

Maybe today I'll not wear you anymore
I'll fold you away, lay you down where you belong
Maybe you'll wake in time to break open a smile
Wide and wild as the Humber

Satellite
Are you dancing tonight
Are you burning as bright
As the she-boy outside
The firefly
