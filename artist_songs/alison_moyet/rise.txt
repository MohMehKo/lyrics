Baby loose that frying pan
You don't live to feed that man
Nothing's gained through self-denial
'Cos you weren't born to be servile 
Don't you know you've gotta
Rise - Think about what you do now
Where do you belong
Are you somebody's niggababe
Or does the fight go on

Do you think the hurting is gonna go away
If you leave uprising for another day

Hey Mister! Better teach your child to run
From all you name as just harmless fun
Do you show respect everywhere you go
Do you teach the young man how to treat your own

Don't you know you've gotta
Rise - Think about what you do now
How do you behave
Would you leave your children
What you see today

Freedom to the children of the world

Think about what you do now
Everything you see
Life ain't living in a magazine
Life ain't living

Sister! Why do you trade it in
For a diamond chip and a rabbit skin
His big red car is a mote too fast
And it wasn't built for the ride to last

Freedom to the slave of the slave
(And you know you are)
