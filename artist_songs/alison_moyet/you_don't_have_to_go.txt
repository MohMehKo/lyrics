Look at your face, it's like looking at mine
This was our room when we used to know
How to share ourselves in silence
You don't have to go

Feeling your hands, almost like mine
This was our space, when we used to mind
That we knew ourselves in silence
You don't have to go

All we gave away is never coming back
All the love we made is anything but that
And I feel, it's everything I know
You don't have to go

Look at your eyes, looking at mine
These were our words when we used to know
How to share ourselves in silence
You don't have to go
