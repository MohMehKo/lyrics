Anytime at all
I would change my life for you
Happiness settles where you are

Anytime at all
I would choose to stay with you
Togetherness is not so far
I love you so

That is why, and it's why
I'm ready to sustain
The pleasure and the pain
Oh and all the crazy turns
With you my love

Anything you need
If it raised a smile in you
I want to bring it to your door

Everything I need
In the sleepy sighing
Of somebody here who needs me more
I love you so

That is why, and it's why
I'm ready to sustain
The pleasure and the pain
Oh and all the crazy turns
With you my love

Anytime at all
To stop those lonely tears that fall
And how they made you feel so small
If not me, who you gonna call?

And that is why, it's why
Its why, its why, it's why
I'm ready to sustain
The pleasure and the pain
Oh and all the crazy turns
With you my love

That is why, that is why
I'm ready to sustain
The pleasure and the pain
Oh and all the crazy turns
With you my love

Anytime at all
I would change my life for you
Happiness settles where you are
