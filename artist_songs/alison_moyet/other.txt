I don't know precisely which day
Coloured me other
Perchance it may've been a slow bleed

So I cut out whichever shape I need
I don't sue for rescue
I'm as free as I have ever been

Don't want another rock 
To hang about my neck 
You see bejewelled 
I see bedecked
In dead stars

And nothing
Touching me 
Nothing touching me

I am glad for open windows
I call for birds that do not come
You beacon dead eyed welcome

Bones bleach off the city
And when I'm done I'm done I'm done
Keep the turn over our aim

I don't want to look upon another word
This heart so lightly thrown
I say disarm I hear disown 
It sounds familiar 

And nothing
Touching me 
Nothing touching me

I don't want another rock
To hang about my neck
You see bejewelled 
I see bedecked in dead stars

I don't want to look upon another word
This deal so lightly spent 
And what says here
Says came and went
It sounds familiar 

Nothing's touching me 
Nothing's touching meï»¿
