No easy about it
Born to a mountain slide
You're gonna learn to take a dive

No easy about it
I won't tell you not to need it
Cos you don't want no chatter now
Wears you down just to sit it out
And you don't want to hear a thing about
What he should but doesn't think about
When you wanted him without a doubt

You learn to skate on something this cold
And down the hills that summer used to fill with honey flowers
That I know you could never bear to carry home
Are deep in snow

(All that I want)
Everything I ever wanted
(All that I need)
(All that I have)
Everything I ever wanted
(All I believe)
Is sitting down here with me
Feeling like a bad man
(Feeling like a bad man)

Do I love you only
You are the child I wanted
You are dear
And down the hills that summer used to fill with honey flowers
You could never bear to carry home
Are deep in snow

You learn to skate on
Something's cold
You're free a little moment to feel

Do I love you only
You are the child I wanted
You are dear
And down the hills that summer used to fill with honey flowers
You could never bear to carry home
Are deep in snow

(You learn to skate on)
