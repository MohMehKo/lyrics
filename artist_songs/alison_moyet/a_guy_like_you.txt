They're all looking at you now, pretty butterfly
Every colour of spring by the summer sky
And the way that you swing, like a metronome
Every body wants the number of your telephone
And you know it

Sweeter than 'I told you so'
Cooler than the place to go
Every station plays your record on the radio

How'm I gonna keep my eye on a guy like you
(How'm I gonna keep a guy like you)
How'm I gonna keep my eye on a guy like you
(How'm I gonna keep a guy like you)
How'm I gonna keep my eye on a guy like you

If their making a list, their gonna put you on
If your going to sit they'll make the table long
When you get up to dance their gonna clear the floor
They want to know if you'll move them like you did before
And you know it

Sweeter than 'I told you so'
Cooler than the place to go
Every body plays your music on the stereo

How'm I gonna keep my eye on a guy like you
(How'm I gonna keep a guy like you)
How'm I gonna keep my eye on a guy like you
(How'm I gonna keep a guy like you)
How'm I gonna keep my eye on a guy like you

What am I gonna do
With a guy like you
Wow... guy like you

How'm I gonna keep my eye on a guy like you
(How'm I gonna keep a guy like you)
How'm I gonna keep my eye on a guy like you
(How'm I gonna keep a guy like you)
How'm I gonna keep my eye on a guy like you

What am I gonna do...
