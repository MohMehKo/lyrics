Suddenly the landscape has changed
Horizon Flame
In the stream, what is square?
Would you put the lights out? Dead
Look at all the lights out there
Could have been enough for you
Living like we needed to
Would have been enough left for you

[Chorus:]
You can be the sire
You were never plain
Go and paint that sign
Ordinary pain
Ordinary pain
Ordinary pain
Ordinary pain

In the stars, what is care?
Would you keep the sound down? Dead
Look at all the stars out there
Could have been enough for you
Talking as we needed to
Would have been enough left for you

[Chorus:]
You can be the sire
You were never plain
Go and paint that sign
Ordinary pain
Ordinary pain
Ordinary pain
Ordinary pain

You can be the sire
You were never plain
Go and paint that sign
Ordinary pain
Ordinary pain
Ordinary pain
Ordinary pain
