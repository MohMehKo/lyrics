If you can't find me here
Mirror catch my breath
Deep in the thick of still
All the thirsty beasts come down to drink

Water buffers your skin
Stone forbids me to come in
I taste a ballet in this storm
Even as the paper falls
It dances

And we're big cats pacing fences
Wild cats counting inches
Hungry seeing hungry
Feed on Reassuring Pinches

Play something that will sing
Wear a porch-face frown
Let sun colour us in
When just the hand remembers now

Water buffers our skin
So truly we are untouching
Paper leaps it's ballet in a storm
Whichever way we fall
We're dancing

And we're big cats pacing fences
Wild cats counting inches
Hungry seeing hungry
Feed on Reassuring Pinches
