Can I sleep on your floor tonight?
If I promise to stay there
I want to be with you
It's too late to go back home
I can say what you want me to
If it's words that please you
I'll talk forever
I'll never be alone 
You didn't tell me that you had to leave 
And now I want to know the reason why
You had to question everything I see
Every time I close me eyes

I've gotta work on someone
Let me work on you
You know I've gotta work on someone
Maybe your made to work me too

This thing across is a mile wide
Could we bridge the distance
I want to go outside
Don't hide yourself away
Muddy hands to the dirty mind
Play us in the peepshow
Oh let them be right this time
No matter what they say

Are you worried that you're being fooled 
And tomorrow you'll be left behind
Why do you question everything I do
Every time I leave your side

I've gotta work on someone
Let me work on you
You know I've gotta work on someone
Maybe you're made to work me too
