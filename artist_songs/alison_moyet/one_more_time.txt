Turn the light out
Suddenly your eyes are tired
Rest on the heel of your hand
Wait for the feeling to subside
And he stirs
And even now you want him
Even in a room this blue
Here with these words in your mouth
And that's still good enough for you
It's what you do

If all that we make here is sorrow
And all that we get we just borrow
I'll still buy
So can we try
One more time.

Nobody made us
No one dragged us kicking here
If easy was on the cards
Then someone made it disappear
And he smiles
And even now you hate him
Only now he wants you to
The liberties you take
For what he won't be giving you
That's what you do

If all that we make here is sorrow
And all that we get we just borrow
I'll still but
So can we try
One more time

He turns the light on
Sits down where he watches you
Tells you he couldn't sleep
He has something to share with you
That's what we do

If all that we make here is sorrow
And all that we get we just borrow
I'll still buy
So can we try
One more Time
