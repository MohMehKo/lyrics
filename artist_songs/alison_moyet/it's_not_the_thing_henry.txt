You're asking the wrong question
To the wrong person
And it's hurting you to listen
I wanna be truthful
But you gotta be certain
This is what you mean

Ah Henry, would you look at me
You cannot have it all and I will not make it easy
Henry, I'm not grateful for small mercies
No matter how light the purse is
All the things you need don't mean a thing to me - 
It's not the air I breathe
It's not the thing Henry

Am I taking the wrong meaning
In concluding
That the error is of your choosing?
You've got to be simple
If you think that you're moving
More than the ire in me

Ah Henry, would you look at me
You cannot have it all and I will not make it easy
Henry, I'm not grateful for small mercies
No matter how light the purse is
All the things you need don't mean a thing to me - 
It's not the air I breathe
It's not the thing Henry

All the things you need don't mean a thing to me - 
It's not the air I breathe
It's not the thing Henry...
