How sound my contemplating?
Counting on your fingers while they're hesitating
Folded into every fibre of the bed you make
Are you sleeping somewhere?
I'm wide awake

Keep me with you
Hidden in soft vowels and your apple kisses
Keep me with you
Sipping soft vowels from your apple kisses
Keep me with you
When the truth bends and the word misses
Keep me with you
Sipping soft vowels from your apple kisses

It took us so long to accept the changing
Then come the minute and we're rearranging
Flowing into my lap
Like a cat
Raises the sap
Do I make it easy?
Then take it back

Keep me with you
Hidden in soft vowels and your apple kisses
Keep me with you
Sipping soft vowels from your apple kisses
Keep me with you
When the truth bends and the word misses
Keep me with you
Sipping soft vowels from your apple kisses
