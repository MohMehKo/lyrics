Radio through my car window
Mouths make shapes
Hullos that look like violence
We pull out
And here the traffic waltzes
Slow, quick, go
Move over you say

[Pre-chorus:]
How does anybody get to work like this
Can anybody tell me does it work like this?

[Chorus:]
I remember when the world was a little girl
Every corner turned leading back to her
Flowing like a stream on a rolling stone
Certain there was nothing changing

Heel to toe,
We throw our forward roll and hope
Something somewhere is catching
Spill onto a boulevard
I lose my grip of you
Move with me I say

[Pre-chorus:]
How does anybody get to work like this
Can anybody tell me does it work like this?

[Chorus:]
I remember when the world was a little girl
Every corner turned leading back to her
Flowing like a stream round a rolling stone
Dream that I was never changing
Changing

And in every face I should chance to meet
I’m looking for the one that could still ṗlace me
Any corner turned back for her
Dream that we were never changing
