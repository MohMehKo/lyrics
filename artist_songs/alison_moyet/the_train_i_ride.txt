I've been keeping you safe inside for the longest time
I've being trying to keep alive the paper kisses you sign
And even now when any body breathes you name 
I prepare to feel that pain
Bearing down like the train coming through in a minute
Oh it's war, it's farce, it's cinema
It's one long ride an inch too far

The louder you scream, the faster you go
The more that you learn the less that you know
I brought a ticket and there's no way I can ride but alone
But somewhere it stops and that's letting go

Didn't want to be right tonight, you were out of line
I made a meal of this mess of mine for the very last time
And one day when you stumble, I won't break your fall
It won't hurt any more 
But I'll ride on the train coming through in a minute
Going south and on so let it come
The train I ride won't always run

I got a ticket and it's going to take a while, going slow
But it's going to stop and that's letting go
I took my chances and I'm going to have to go with the flow
But somewhere it stops and that's letting go
