We never see the end begin
Only when it settles in
We didn't have so long to wait
But even now it's hard to take
Everyday you change your mind
But every way we turn you find
Another reason to be sure
Nothing's mending anymore

I'm gonna leave you now
Even when I don't know how
I'm ever gonna look away
From your precious face
You made the day begin
You were a breath of spring
Giving me everything
But a place to stay

The one I want is sitting here
Considering which way to steer
Now you say it's mine to choose
Which hand you would hate more to lose
Every day you change your mind
And every minute draw a different line
You leave me numb I let my feet decide
And they're moving like they think that I

I'm gonna leave you now
Even when I don't know how
I'm ever gonna look away
From your precious face
You were the morning light
You were the fireside
You make it almost like
A place to stay
