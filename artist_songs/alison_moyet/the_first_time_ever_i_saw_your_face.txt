The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars were the gift you gave
To the dark and empty skies (my love)

The first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hand
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command
(My love... That was there at my command)

The first time ever I lay with you
And felt your heart beat over mine
And I thought our joy would fill the earth
And last till the end of time my love
And last to the end of time
