Lully lulla, thou little tiny Child
Bye bye lully, lullay

Oh, sisters too, how may we do?
For to preserve this day
This poor Youngling for whom we do sing
Bye bye lully, lullay

Herod the King, in his raging
Charged he hath this day
His men of might, in his own sight
All young children, to slay

Then woe is me, poor Child, for Thee
And ever mourn and day
For Thy parting neither say nor sing
Bye bye lully, lullay

Lully lulla, thou little tiny Child
Bye bye lully, lullay
