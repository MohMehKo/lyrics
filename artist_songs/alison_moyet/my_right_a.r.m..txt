Don't be afraid of the dark my love
What would old Hobbs do with this pure heart?

Where shadows inch like rising damp
Their seaweed fingers will us all to be wakeful, oh

What a night for naming stars and parking cars
Sink into our cloud of down and sleep with me

Angel, angel, hold your head up high
In no way let God's kingdom pass you by

There's an open door and the lights are on
And all the goings on, the shouting mouths are gone

Though why should I care anyway?
I'll see your sweet face everyday and that's everything oh

A prayer that I may never find you there
Folded up in an empty room too tired to laugh at a vaulting moon

Angel, angel, hold your head up high
In no way let God's kingdom pass you by
In no way let God's kingdom pass you by
