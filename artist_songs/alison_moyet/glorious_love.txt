Somewhere in the shadows of your eyes
An element that takes me by surprise
Something wants to pull me to my feet
Willing me to go into retreat
But how can I get up and walk away
When ninety-nine percent decides to stay
And watch the other fade to grey 
This glorious love will tear us down
When nothing is left to turn around
And giving it all is not enough
For this glorious love

This pleasure never ought to be denied
For this is joy personified
You can talk to me of give and take
When I could take of you for takings sake
But how can I deny what's on my mind
Knowing it to be of my design
Relegated - I resign

This glorious love will tear us down
When nothing is left to turn around
And giving it all is not enough
For this glorious love
