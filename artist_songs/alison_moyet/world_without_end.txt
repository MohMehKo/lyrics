Perpetual light
Eternal rest
Grant unto her
Her soul be blessed
And her faithful heart
With all pain, depart

Lighter than air
Safer in your arms
Borne on the breeze
Welcome in your arms
World without end

Be there no doubt
Be there no fear
Within your love
Our one glad heart
Offered up to you
Our precious soul for you

How sweet the refrain
Safer in your arms
Hold us again
Welcome in your arms
World without end

May we remain
Ever in your guard
- Home again
Safely in your arms
World without end
