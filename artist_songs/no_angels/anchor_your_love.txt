It was the first time we met 
I never forget 
The way you looked at me 
I felt my heart skip a beat 
I never thought that I would 
Ever find this 
Until the moment that I felt your gentle kiss 
The way you love me baby 
No man has loved me before 
I never felt so good 
And now I'm wanting you so much more 
I wanna stay by your side 
And if you treat me right 
I never be untrue 
And that is why I'm asking you 

How can I anchor your love? 
Tell me how can we reach the stars above? 
It's only you that I'm thinking of 
And all the love you bring 
Each and every night I'm dreaming 

How can I anchor your love? 
Your love? 
How can I anchor your love? 

The precious love that we share 
I promised to care 
Baby, you look so fine 
And I'm so glad that you're mine 
I never thought that I would 
Fall in love like this 
The love you offer me 
I just could not resist 

The way you love me baby 
No man has loved me before 
I never felt so good 
And now I'm wanting you so much more 
Boy when I'm dreaming of love 
It's you I'm thinking of 
There ain't no other one 
Who makes me wanna sing this song 

Boy I really like you 

How can I anchor your love? 
Tell me how can we reach the stars above? 
It's only you that I'm thinking of 
And all the love you bring 
Each and every night I'm dreaming 

How can I anchor your love? 
Tell me how can we reach the stars above? 
It's only you that I'm thinking of 
And all the love you bring 
Each and every night I'm dreaming 

All the love that you bring 
I'll give you everything 
All the things that you do 
I wanna be with you 

Everything I gave you everything 
And all the love you bring 
It's such a precious thing 

Everything I gave you everything 
And all the love you bring 
It's such a precious thing 

How can I anchor your love? 
Tell me how can we reach the stars above? 
It's only you that I'm thinking of 
And all the love you bring 
Each and every night I'm dreaming 

How can I anchor your love? 
Tell me how can we reach the stars above? 
It's only you that I'm thinking of 
And all the love you bring 
Each and every night I'm dreaming
