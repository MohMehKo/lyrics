When I wake up in the morning
The first thing I do
Is when I see your smiling face
I give the world a love embrace
Feeling so glad I found you
In each and every moment
I need you by my side
My ultimate desire is
Your tender kiss I always miss
So kissing is all we should do

Not anyone could love you better
(Much better than I do)
Not anyone could love you more
(The one that I adore)

Now that we've found love
All I wanna do
Is always making love to you
'Cause now that we've found love
In each and every night
I wish to hold you tight
Just making love

When I lay down in the evening
To have sweetest dreams of you
I only need to close my eyes
When suddenly I realize
That all of my dreams have come true
In each and every moment
I need you by my side
My ultimate desire is
Your tender kiss I always miss
So kissing is all we should do

Not anyone could love you better
(Much better than I do)
Not anyone could love you more
(The one that I adore)

Now that we've found love
All I wanna do
Is always making love to you
'Cause now that we've found love
In each and every night
I wish to hold you tight
Just making love

We only have one life to live
To live life in love I spend it with you
And we just got one heart to give
To give all my love I give it to you

Now that we've found love...

Ruled by desire
Love burns like fire
No feelings get higher than love
