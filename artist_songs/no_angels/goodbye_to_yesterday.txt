All our planets used to fade and our days
They don't circulate the same opinion no more
No All the colours turned to grey
We've done a straing
Our relationship is sailing of the shore

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm sick of living this way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But I know it's gonna change

No matter if it's right or wrong this time
We gotta leave the past behind
There is nothing more to say
So goodbye to yesterday
Standing at the point of no return
As the tears run down my face
No turning back
I wonder that
So goodbye to yesterday
Goodbye to yesterday

I don't know where we went wrong
But the guides we're wrong
It's just killing everything that just to be
Everyday is the same old song
No we can't go on
Covering our eyes from the reality

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm sick of living this way

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But I know it's gonna change

No matter if it's right or wrong this time
We gotta leave the past behind
There is nothing more to say
So goodbye to yesterday
Standing at the point of no return
As the tears run down my face
No turning back
I wonder that
So goodbye to yesterday
Goodbye to yesterday

Just say goodbye
To the days we had
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We're sayin' goodbye to the love we shared
No matter if it's right or wrong this time
We gotta leave the past behind
There is nothing more to say
So goodbye to yesterday
Standing at the point of no return
As the tears run down my face
No turning back
I wonder that
So goodbye to yesterday
