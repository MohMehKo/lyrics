Push me to the limit, I can't wait
Push me to the limit, can't you feel

Time to time I'm (just) too blind to see
Oh so many things brought into our life (we're dreaming)
Everyday I try to find the key
The fire of desire
Life should carry on 'till the end of time

Push me to the limit / I can't wait a minute
Please don't ask, ask me for devotion
Push me to the limit / I can't wait a minute
Can't you feel the poetry in motion
(I can't wait, I can't wait)
…….
(I can't wait, I can't wait)

When I'm walking down the line to see
Every danger that life can bring to me (for dreaming)
Change is a stranger, but I feel so free
We're dancing through our life
An' this should carry on 'till the end of time

Push me to the limit / I can't wait a minute
Please don't ask, ask me for devotion
Push me to the limit / I can't wait a minute
Can't you feel the poetry in motion
(I can't wait, I can't wait)
…….
(I can't wait, I can't wait)
It's poetry in motion…..
(I can't wait, I can't wait)
…….
(I can't wait, I can't wait)
Life should carry on 'till the end of time

Push me to the limit / I can't wait a minute
Please don't ask, ask me for devotion
Push me to the limit / I can't wait a minute
Can't you feel the poetry in motion

Push me to the limit / I can't wait a minute
Please don't ask, ask me for devotion
Push me to the limit / I can't wait a minute
Can't you feel the poetry in motion
Push me to the limit / I can't wait a minute
Please don't ask, ask me for devotion
Push me to the limit / I can't wait a minute
Can't you feel the poetry in motion
