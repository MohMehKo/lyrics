I put my back against the wall
This frozen track a judgement call.
No Am I a creep with no self-esteem
The truth cuts deep but it cuts clean
Angels Guess I gotta let it show

To break the ice would take a miracle
A thousand lies that I´m trying so hard to ignore
I´ve been here before
I´ve been here before
I´ve been here before

You reach for my hand I turn away
You don´t understand what I´m trying to say
A cold embrace around my heart,
Give me some space, I´m falling apart

And even though we´ve been through hell,
To break the ice would take a miracle
A thousand lies that I´m trying so hard to ignore
I´ve been here before
I´ve been here before
I´ve been here before

Slowly, slowly down this river
Slowly, slowly I´m drifting away

But I´ve been here before
I´ve been here before
I´ve been here before
I´ve been here before

But to break the ice would take a miracle
A thousand lies that I´m trying so hard to ignore
Trying so hard to ignore
I´ve been here before
