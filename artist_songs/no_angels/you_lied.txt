She was beautiful
Her smile too intimate
Before she turned away
That girl we passed today
And I saw the face of confusion
Broke through your mask of illusion
And walked inside
Uh oh uh oh, uh oh uh oh, you lied
I saw what the hell you been doing

And I know it
Uh oh uh oh, uh oh uh oh, you lied
And I know it
Don't say
I am everything
She is nothing to you

The times before now
It's so strange
I'm remembering
I swallowed my intuitions
When you talked away my suspicions
And closed my eyes
So what the hell was I thinking

Uh oh uh oh, uh oh uh oh, you lied
And I know it
And I know it
Uh oh uh oh, uh oh uh oh, you lied

The truth changes everything
That's what I think
You know what I think?
You love note is not worth
The paper you wrote it on
So I'll be gone
