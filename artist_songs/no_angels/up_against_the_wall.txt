I know you see me,tell me why you standing over there
I'm like a wallpaper baby waiting for you to tear
I'm ready,breathin heavy,hot & Sweaty,overload
Let's hideaway in the shadows right,right behind the stairs

Oh,oh,oh,my temperaure's outta control
Oh,oh,oh,I'm ready to overdose

[Chorus:]
I know you wanna arrest me,
I'm up against the wall,the wall,the wall
Come on & cuff me,
baby I feel your eyes,they undress me
Come up against the wall,I'm yours,
come on I'm up against the wall

The wall,the wall
I'm up against the wall
The wall,the wall
I,I'm up against the wall

I don't care,just let em stare
It's hot when someone sees
I'm no angel,work the angle like a fantasy
Speed it up,I need it ruff
Then beat it nice and slow
I feel your hands going south
and I'm about to sream

Oh,oh,oh,my temperaure's outta control
Oh,oh,oh,I'm ready to overdose

[Chorus]

I wanna feel (I wanna feel)
I wanna feel you close
I wanna be,your sensuality

Up against the wall,come on,baby,baby
Up against the wall,come on,baby,baby
Up against the wall,come on,baby,baby
Up against the wall

[Chorus]
