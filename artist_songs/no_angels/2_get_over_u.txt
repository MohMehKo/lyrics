The sky has quite a
Different shade of blue
Don't see no storm-clouds
Rollin'into view
There's something different
In the air tonight
There's nothing missin'
And I feel alright

What's come over
I'm getting stronger every day
A new awakening
I wanna celebrate
2 get over you

No - more tears to cry
Now- I feel free inside
I - I've made up my mind
2 get up, 2 get out, 2 get over u
Do - what you wanna do
Say - what you gotta say
I'm - finally on my way
2 get up, 2 get out, 2 get over u

For so long I only blamed myself
Locked my love away inside a shell
Afraid to try, afraid to give again
No way, no how was
Someone gettin' in

(no-no-no-no-no)
Now I realize -
My life's about to start
I just needed time -
To open up my heart.
