[Verse 1:]
We both met in January but
He´ll be gone by February
Cause see, I need love
But on the contrary ry ry ry
I´m a rebel
I´ll be nearby don´t you worry
If you need something
I´ll be in a hurry
But don´t you blink
Oh no no Baby don´t you blink
I´m a rebel
I´m a rebel
I´m a rebel
I´m a rebel

And it feels just fine
Yeah it feels just fine
Baby understand me
I don´t trust you any
When it comes to love
I´m a rebel

[Chorus:]
I don´t wanna be in love
No in love I don´t wanna be
Don´t wanna be in love
No in love I don´t wanna be
Don´t wanna be in love
No in love I don´t wanna
I´m a rebel
I´m a rebel

[Verse 2:]
What is love and
Who really has it see
I found love but it ended tragically
And ever since then I said
Never again
I´m a rebel
I´m a rebel
I´m a rebel
I´m a rebel
I´m a rebel, yes indeed
I don´t want anyone to fall in
Love with me
But see if they tried I´d put up a fight
Screaming rebel
Screaming rebel

And it feels just fine
Yeah it feels just fine
Baby understand me
I don´t trust you any
When it comes to love
I´m a rebel

[Chorus:]
I don´t wanna be in love
No in love I don´t wanna be
Don´t wanna be in love
No in love I don´t wanna be
Don´t wanna be in love
No in love I don´t wanna
I´m a rebel
I´m a rebel
