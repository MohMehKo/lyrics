[Vany]
So hard to trust that you can live and be sure
I made a promise that I wonder no more
I dream myself to all the good things in life
my happiness I won't sacrifice

[Nadja]
I made a change more messin' around now I got my feet heppin' on the ground
no longer runnin' with no place to go don't tell me that it isn't so

[Refrain (All):]
Now the rain has gone and I'm movin' on like a gentle autumn breeze
no I won't hold on
'cause it won't be long
'til I - I'm crusin' on a autumn breeze

[Jessica]
Gotta keep believin' that I'm free
no guys or shackles gonna ever hold me look out for myself that's what I'm gonna do
Ain't lookin' for somebody new

[Lucy]
I've got my reasons why I'm feeling this way
see people take love and just throw it away
no longer hidin', this is where I wanna be
I'm flyin' like the wind on the sea

[Refrain (All):]
Now the rain has gone and I'm movin' on like a gentle autumn breeze
no I won't hold on
'cause it won't be long
'til I - I'm crusin' on a autumn breeze

[Refrain (Sandy):]
Now the rain has gone and I'm movin' on like a gentle autumn breeze
no I won't hold on
'cause it won't be long
'til I - I'm crusin' on a autumn breeze

[2x Refrain (All)]
