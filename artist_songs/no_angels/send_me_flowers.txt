Send me flowers shana nanana
Oh send me flowers
Just to say you're sorry
Send me flowers
Oh send me flowers
Send me flowers

So many days we spent together
Don't you miss this love of mine
Dreams will never last forever
After the rain the sun will shine

If you want me you need me
Send a little message
Since you left me I'm waiting
Waiting for a call
If you love me you miss me
Send a little message of your love
Let me see a sign

Send me flowers
Shanananana oh send me flowers
Just to say you're sorry
Send me flowers
Shanananana oh send me flowers
I miss you come back into my life

Can't a man show what he's feeling
Can't he show what's on his mind
Like a deep wound goes on healing
I left all the things behind

If you want me you need me
Send a little message
Since you left me I'm waiting
Waiting for a call
If you love me you miss me
Send a little message of your love
Let me see a sign

Send me flowers
Shanananana oh send me flowers
Just to say you're sorry
Send me flowers
Shanananana oh send me flowers
I miss you come back into my life

If you want me you need me
Send a little message
Since you left me I'm waiting
Waiting for a call
If you love me you miss me
Send a little message of your love
Let me see a sign

Send me flowers
Shanananana oh send me flowers
Just to say you're sorry
Send me flowers
Shanananana oh send me flowers
I miss you come back into my life
