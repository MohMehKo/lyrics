I could never be
I could never feel
Free without your love

You count on me
Truly honesty
You can trust love

Lying close to you
Makes me feel so blue
Feelings fade away

If it's really true
I'll be missing you
Where's the love we had

My desire burns like fire
You're as cold as ice

Don't fool me anymore
Don't touch me anymore
You're as cold as ice

Ooh I don't know
What's right now
Ooh love is gone
And now you're cold as ice

Lying close to you
Makes me feel so blue
Feelings fade away

If it's really true
I'll be missing you
Where's the love we had

My desire burns like fire
You're as cold as ice

Don't fool me anymore
Don't touch me anymore
You're as cold as ice

Ooh I don't know
What's right now
Ooh love is gone
And now you're cold as ice

I could never be
I could never feel
Free without your love

You count on me
Truly honesty
You can trust love

Lying close to you
Makes me feel so blue
Feelings fade away

If it's really true
I'll be missing you
Where's the love we had

My desire burns like fire
You're as cold as ice

Don't fool me anymore
Don't touch me anymore
You're as cold as ice

Ooh I don't know
What's right now
Ooh love is gone
And now you're cold as ice
