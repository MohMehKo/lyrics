You could be could be the first

So what about diving
In the falling rain
And what about waiting
Yeah I suffer the same
Let's sleep in a field
Where the grass is green

You could be the first
In the universe
To make me cry boy
To make me cry

You could be the first
In the universe
To make me cry boy
To make me cry

And what about wanting
And what about pain
This is the real thing
It's not a game
Let's climb the big hills
Where the grass is green

You could be the first
In the universe
To make me cry boy
To make me cry

You could be the first
In the universe
To make me cry boy
To make me cry

Making me cry boy
Making me cry boy
Don't you know that
Don't you know that
Don't you know that you can making me cry boy

So what about diving
In the falling rain
This is the real thing
It's not a game

You could be the first
In the universe
To make me cry boy
To make me cry

You could be the first
In the universe
To make me cry boy
To make me cry

You could be the first
In the universe
To make me cry boy
To make me cry

You could be the first
In the universe
To make me cry boy
To make me cry
