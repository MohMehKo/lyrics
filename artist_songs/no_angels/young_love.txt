We´re still talking on the phone in the mornin
we started talking on the phone since the night before
I might be tired but the laughter is pouring
so I think I´ll stay up some more

It´s like we´re sixteen again
I haven´t felt like this for so long
I never want it to end
and it takes me back

[CHORUS:]
it feels like young love
it feels like butterflies singing around me
it feels like young love
and even when we´re old and grey
we´re still gonna stay
in young love

How can I stand up on my feet when I´m trippin´
I get so weak in the knees every time we touch
Oh I´m melting from the heat of your kisses
and when our tongues are tied
we can go all through the night

It´s like the first time again
I haven´t felt like this for so long
I´m melting into your hand
And it takes me back
do you know baby that

[CHORUS:]
it feels like young love
it feels like butterflies singing around me
it feels like young love
and even when we´re old and grey
we´re still gonna stay

Time stands still
when you´re around
Time stands still
when you´re around
Time stands still
when you´re around

[CHORUS x2]

In young love
