Well it ain't my style
To be jealous and bad mouthin'
I can see some trouble comin'
But I've known a while
But I think you might regret it
Will you take advice
Shut your eyes
And remember that I said it baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

She's eleven outta ten for misery
So get your act together
Can't you see?
She's eleven outta ten for vanity
And everyone sees it, but you
When you've woken up come around
Well I know her type
When you're broken up come around
She's a mover and a shaker

When the time is right
She will turn around and break you
Get with me
I will cut the ties that bind you
So tenderly
Give the sign and I will find you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

She's eleven outta ten for misery
So get your act together
She's eleven outta ten for vanity
Can't you see?
When you're broken up come around
When you've woken up come around
And everyone sees it, but you

Eleven outta ten it don't add up
Eleven outta ten boy you're stuck
Eleven outta ten you're all messed up

Eleven outta ten it don't add up
Eleven outta ten boy you're stuck
Eleven outta ten you're all messed up

When you've woken up come around
When you're broken up come around

When you've woken up come around

When you're broken up come around
She's eleven outta ten for misery
So get your act together
Can't you see?
She's eleven outta ten for vanity
And everyone sees it, but you
When you've woken up come around
When you're broken up come around
