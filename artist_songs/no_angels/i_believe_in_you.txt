Sometimes everything around me gets me all confused
Sometimes it's hard to see and understand the truth
Where do we go and all the sense don't make a better sense
When all the rules and all just been

I guess it's easy to lose faith
But I've been blessed up from my way
'Cause all I need to know

Is a believe in my love for you
It lights me up inside
I believe in the things I feel
Just looking in your eyes

And every moment we share
Reminds me of what's good and true
I believe in my love for you, baby
The joy that you bring me
I believe in you

Sometimes the world can seem so big and make you feel so small
Sometimes it feels like all you do is fall
What gives us strength and keep it going when we hit the wall
Together up every morning ready to give it all

I guess it's easy to lose faith
But I've been blessed up from my way
'Cause all I need to know

Is a believe in my love for you
It lights me up inside
I believe in the things I feel
Just looking in your eyes

And every moment we share
Reminds me of what's good and true
I believe in my love for you, baby
The joy that you bring me
I believe in you, I believe in you

I believe in you
All that I need, all that I want
Is right here inside, inside of my heart
Keeping me strong, keeps me holding on

All that I need and all that I want
Is right here inside, inside of my heart
Keeping me strong, keeps me holding on
'Cause all I need to know

Is a believe in my love for you
It lights me up inside
I believe in the things I feel
Just looking in your eyes

And every moment we share
Reminds me of what's good and true
I believe in my love for you, baby
The joy that you bring me
I believe in you

I believe in my love for you
It lights me up inside
I believe in the things I feel
Just looking in your eyes

And every moment we share
Reminds me of what's good and true
I believe in my love for you, baby
The joy that you bring me
I believe in you

I believe in you
