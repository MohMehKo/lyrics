When you walk along the beach, you see the boys and the girls.
In the midday heat is all you need, an ice cream in your hand.
Just lay down in the summer sun, the good vibrations will come.

Like ice in the sunshine,
like ice in the sunshine.
I'm melting away,
on this sunny day.

If you wanna have some fun, you'll get it down by the sea.
You don't care about whatever, just today is the day.
With ice cream and the summer sun, the good vibrations will come.

Like ice in the sunshine,
like ice in the sunshine.
I'm melting away,
on this sunny day.
Like ice in the sunshine,
like ice in the sunshine.
I'm melting away,
on this sunny day.

Like ice in the sunshine,
I'm melting,
ice in the sunshine,
hmmmm,
sunshine.

Like ice in the sunshine,
like ice in the sunshine.
I'm melting away,
on this sunny day.
Like ice in the sunshine,
like ice in the sunshine.
I'm melting away,
on this sunny day.
