[Verse 1:]

I, I know that you were the first in love
Stuck around while my heart played dumb
Kept holding on
When I open up to the light of day
I just hope that I´ll see your face
Kept holding on

[Chorus:]

So don´t walk away don´t walk away now
I´m here with you I´m with you right now
Keep holding on keep holding on
Minute by minute, minute by minute
I´m falling in I´m falling deeper
Each step I take I´m getting closer
It wont be long it wont be long
Minute by minute, minute by minute

[Verse 2:]

I´m seeing things from your point of view
I´m inching over making room for two
Keep holding
I started of thinking this ain´t me
But I´ve changed directions cuz I finally see
I want you more
Minute by minute

[Chorus:]

So don´t walk away don´t walk away now
I´m here with you I´m with you right now
Keep holding on keep holding on
Minute by minute, minute by minute
I´m falling in I´m falling deeper
Each step I take I´m getting closer
It wont be long it wont be long
Minute by minute, minute by minute

[Bridge:]

Love just turns us into fools
That´s right, look at me with you
Couldn´t see what you always knew
Wherever I´m going is somewhere that you´ll be

[Chorus:]

So don´t walk away don´t walk away now
I´m here with you I´m with you right now
Keep holding on keep holding on
Minute by minute, minute by minute
I´m falling in I´m falling deeper
Each step I take I´m getting closer
It wont be long it wont be long
Minute by minute, minute by minute
