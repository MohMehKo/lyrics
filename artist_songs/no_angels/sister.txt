He's a man, he's a wolf 
And he feels the pain of centuries 
Tug of war, not to solve, between his heart and mind unfortunately 
Shut his mouth, long ago, 
He was too proud and he didn't know 
It's a fear, in his soul 
Makes 'em think he's king of sorrow 

He doesn't like to walk in his own shoes 
But there was no one to tell 
So he dreamed of a little sister 
She would love him, if he would fail 

Brother even if you do not see me 
Brother even if you feel confused 
I am here to love and set you free 
I'm your fighter, if you feel abused 
Brother even if you hear no music 
I will sing my lullaby for you 
I'm your defender, I'm ur savior 
I'm your sister and I'll cry for you 

She's not white, she's not black 
Feels uncomfortable in borderland 
No one keeps her back 
Insecurity is her best friend 
Mother warm, father cold 
And sometimes she couldn't deal with it 
Always torn, not her fault 
So she dreamed of a home, where she would fit 

She doesn't like to walk in her own shoes 
But there was no one to tell 
So she dreamed of a little sister 
She would love her, if she would fail 

Sister even if you do not see me 
Sister even if you feel confused 
I am here to love and set you free 
I'm ur fighter if you feel abused 
Sister even if you hear no music 
I will sing my lullaby for you 
I'm your defender, I'm ur savior 
I'm your sister and I'll cry for you 
Be faithful, lean your head on mine 
I give you hope and you'll be fine 
Listen to my whisper 
I'm your sister 

I'm your sister, you're my brother 
If you hold on, I'll fight harder 
I'm ur mother, I'm your teacher 
If you need me, I'm your preacher
