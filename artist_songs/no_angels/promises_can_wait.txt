Promises can wait my baby
So let's not hesitate let's play
I'm looking for a smile
I'm looking for laughter
We'll think of loving after, hey hey
Think of loving after, oh oh yeah

My goodness how you have grown
Last time I saw you you didn't know how to be a man
But I can see you've changed to say the least

And maybe you're the one
At least let's have some fun, baby come on

Promises can wait my baby
So let's not hesitate let's play
I'm looking for a smile
I'm looking for laughter
We'll think of loving after, hey hey
Think of loving after, oh oh yeah

I'm diggin' your vibe and I won't lie
I've had my eye out for that special guy
I was searching far and wide
And here you are next door

And maybe you're the one
At least let's have some fun, ohoho

Promises can wait my baby
So let's not hesitate let's play
I'm looking for a smile
I'm looking for laughter
We'll think of loving after, hey hey
Think of loving after, oh oh yeah

Promises can wait
So let's not hesitate let's play
Promises can wait

And maybe you're the one
At least let's have some fun, oh yeah

Promises can wait my baby
So let's not hesitate let's play
I'm looking for a smile
I'm looking for laughter
We'll think of loving after, hey hey
Think of think of, yeah
