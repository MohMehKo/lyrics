If I'd have known what you would say
I'd have turned and walked away
Can't hold the tears back though I try
Cause there's nothing quite as sad as goodbye
Don't wanna think about tomorrow
You won't be here by my side
All of a sudden I feel hollow
There's nothing quite as sad as goodbye

So I'm alone again
Trying to find a ticket to the next train - to the next train
I'm on my own again
Waiting in line for a new
New beginning

Still I feel that I have lost
I know that we are better off
There's nothing quite as sad as goodbye
When I look into your eye
So I'm alone again

I'm on my own again
New beginning
Trying to find a ticket to the next train - to the next train
Back where I once started
Waiting in line for a new

Now I've got my heart set
Trying my luck again
On a better day
Who's to say what's waiting
Just around the bend

Can't do more than hope and pray for a happy end
So I'm alone again
Trying to find a ticket to the next train - to the next train
Waiting in line for a new
New beginningI'm on my own again
