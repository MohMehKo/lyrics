Everyday she walks the same road
Never looking up, staring straight down at her feet
Watching the time, she slips back in her mind
Wondering if they're ever find her
Cause she thinks she's strange, she thinks she's plain
And the world around her stays the same
But she knows damn well this can't go on
SheÂ´s gotta make a change...and

You don't know...
That the sun's gonna burn and the moon won't shine
You don't see...what's going on
You don't think...
That the bad can't hurt and that good only heals
You don't know...
You better find a way...
To make a change

She's gotta look in her eye
She never feels no surprise
She's gotta guilty feeling in her soul
As they pass her on by
She looks up to the sky
Asking God for a Sign of somekind
And she's wants to survive
To feel so alive make everything count each day
And she knows damn well it's up to her
She's gotta make a change...and

You don't know...
That the sun's gonna burn and the moon won't shine
You don't see...what's going on
You don't think...
That the bad can't hurt and that good only heals
You don't know...
You better find a way...
To make a change

Never know it
You'll never know it
Oh yeah
Never ever, ever gonna know it
So you better, so you better
You better make a change
Oh yeah...and

You don't know...
That the sun's gonna burn and the moon won't shine
You don't see...what's going on
You don't think...
That the bad can't hurt and that good only heals
You don't know...
You better find a way...
To make a change
