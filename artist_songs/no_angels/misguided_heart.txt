Tell me how it came to this
Almost there but then we missed
Seems like everything we do is wrong

Tell me why it is we're blind
From all the bitterness inside
When all I wanna do is carry on

When you just can't see the daylight
And you wanna feel the sunshine
There's nothing there to show you how

With the consequence before you
It can heal you and destroy you
If you let it

Can you just imagine
If we can make it happen
Tell me does it matter
That I'm still hanging on

Are we gonna break it
For someone else to take it
Oh won't you tell me how to stray this love
This misguided heart

Tell me what we need to face
To re-write every page
Coz I'm losing grip on everything

And I dont wanna write a list
of every little word we twist
Am I wasting breath just holding on

When you just can't see the daylight
And you wanna feel the sunshine
It seems so far now

I'm too tired out
I'm sick of this doubt
Tell me there's another way

All I wanna be
Is with someone who wants me
I'm still counting down the days
