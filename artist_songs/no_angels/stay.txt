[Verse 1]

Close your eyes and imagine I'm
Here with you to keep you safe from the dark…
Secretly, I`ve been with you night and day…
Can't believe, you are going away…

Where's the passion we had, tell me where,
Cause I want to see you again…

[Chorus]

Stay, for another night, don't leave me here on my 
Own, look at me, see me crying for you till the
Dawn, see the sun, see the new day begin
I'm wanting you, and I'm begging you to stay!

[Verse 2]

Here I am, lookin' back at the 
Time, that we spent, for the moments of love.
Silly me, I didn't hear you say:
"let me be! Set me free for a day!"

[Chorus]

Stay, for another night, don't leave me here on my 
Own, look at me, see me crying for you till the
Dawn, see the sun, see the new day begin
I'm wanting you, and I'm begging you to stay!

[Bridge]

Every day is like the last,
Memories coming from the past,
I am standing on the top the mountain…
Calling your name…

[Solo]

Where's the passion we had, tell me where
Cause I want to see you again

[Chorus]

Stay, for another night, don't leave me here on my 
Own, look at me, see me crying for you till the
Dawn, see the sun, see the new day begin
I'm wanting you, and I'm begging you to stay!

[Chorus]

Stay, for another night, don't leave me here on my 
Own, look at me, see me crying for you till the
Dawn, see the sun, see the new day begin
I'm wanting you, and I'm begging you to stay!

Pretty little face, I can't forget your
Smiling face, how could I let you!
