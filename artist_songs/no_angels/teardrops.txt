Whenever I hear goodbyes,
reminds me baby of you
fever for lost romance,
reminds me baby of you
I took a crazy chance
Next time I'll be true
I'll be true
I'll be true

Footsteps on the dancefloor
reminds me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes,
next time I'll be true
Whispers in the powder room
"She cries on every tune, every tune, every tune"

Whenever I'm dancing around,
reminds me baby of you
I really let you down,
Next time I'll be true
I took a crazy chance
She cries on every tune, every tune, every tune

Footsteps on the dancefloor
reminds me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes,
next time I'll be true
Whispers in the powder room
"She cries on every tune, every tune, every tune"

And the music don't fell like it did when I felt it with you
Nothing what I do or feel ever feels like I felt it with you

Hurting deep inside,
she cries on every tune
I break down and cry,
"She cries on every tune, every tune, every tune"

Footsteps on the dancefloor
reminds me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes,
next time I'll be true
Whispers in the powder room
"She cries on every tune, every tune, every tune"
