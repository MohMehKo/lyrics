I never knew
It could be like this
I'm surprised to see how it turned out

When your life
Takes a different turn
And every little thing is rearranged

The rhythm of my heart
You came along and changed it
This is where it starts
And it can be amazing
I close my eyes and count to ten
And when I open them again
You change the rhythm of my heart

An open door
The smile I'd waited for
If I could hold a moment in my hand

With every beat
We're stronger than before
Funny how it seems to work out right

The rhythm of my heart
You came along and changed it
This is where it starts
And it can be amazing
I close my eyes and count to ten
And when I open them again
You change the rhythm of my heart

Fragile and confused
But you can never see it
What you're going through
You've gotta feel it to believe it

The rhythm of my heart
You came along and changed it
This is where it starts
And it can be amazing

The rhythm of my heart
You came along and changed it
This is where it starts
And it can be amazing
I close my eyes and count to ten
And when I open them again
You change the rhythm of my heart

Some things are meant to be
It's within reach for me
