[Jessi]
I have waited for so long to find me
Someone there can reach down deep inside me
Never knowin' hopin' for that Mr Right

[Lucy]
Then I saw you all so picture perfect
That's when I knew we were bound to connect
It's not a dream I believe I can touch you with my eyes

[Vany]
Now I'm
[All]
Lost in you
Now I feel something so familiar
Lost in you
Love's so real
That's the day my heart stood still

[Nadja]
I'm on a cloud that has a silver line in
In every way it feels like I'm flyin'
And I'm not worried everything is alright

[Sandy]
I'm so happy anyone could notice
Always smiling is it any wonder
I look at life from a different point of view
[All]
So much easier

[Jessi]
Now I'm
[All]
Lost in you
Now I feel something so familiar
Lost in you
Love's so real
That's the day my heart stood still
Now I'm lost in you
Now I feel something so familiar
Lost in you
Love's so real

[Lucy]
That's the day my heart stood still

[Vany]
Down; down turn out the lights
Take me in your arms tonight
I feel so alive
I'll be stayin' by your side
There's no mistakin'
I will be takin' you
Over and over and over again

[All]
Down; down turn out the lights
Take me in your arms tonight
I feel so alive
I'll be stayin' by your side
[Vany]
There's no mistakin'
I will be takin' you
[All]
Over and over and over again

[Nadja]
Now I'm
[All]
Lost in you
[Nadja]
Now I feel something so familiar
[All]
Lost in you
[Nadja]
Love's so real
That's the day my heart stood still

Lost in you
Now I feel something so familiar
Lost in you
Love's so real
That's the day my heart stood still

Lost in you
Now I feel something so familiar
Lost in you
Love's so real
That's the day my heart stood still

[All]
Lost in you

[Sandy]
That's the day my heart stood still

[All]
Lost in you
