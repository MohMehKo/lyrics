I bet you think we don't know
How to be a part of this game
We don't wanna talk about
The reason what is true
We are not the same
I bet you think what we have
Is like a picture in the frame
Baby don't worry and remember
Why people know our name

[Chorus]

Try to figure out is it real is it show
I don't wanna hear this nasty stuff
Cause you don't know the things I know
Don't ask me what it's all about
You've gotta understand
We do the things
We wanna do we've chosen to eternity
As real as we can
It's something about us
Straight from the heart
We belong together
Right from the start
Destiny told us
There is no doubt
Respect is what it's all about

I bet you think we don't know
What we have got to do
Cause everytime we come around you act like
We don't have a clue
And I bet you think we still care
If you will like us too
But we are through, yeah
You...

[Chorus]

Try to figure out is it real is it show
I don't wanna hear this nasty stuff
Cause you don't know the things I know
Don't ask me what it's all about
You've gotta understand
We do the things
We wanna do we've chosen to eternity
As real as we can
It's something about us
Straight from the heart
We belong together
Right from the start
Destiny told us
There is no doubt
Respect is what it's all about

There's something about us
You can't explain
The only thing we're here for
Is to entertain
Destiny told us
Not to run away
We will make it anyway

God please save us
We are just 5 angels
We are puppets on a string
God please help us
We don't earn any money

Something about us
This is coming from my heart
We belong together
Right from the start
Destiny told us
There should be no doubt

Something about us
It's something that you can't explain
All we want to do
Is to entertain
Respect is what it's all about

It's something about us
Straight from the heart
We belong together
Right from the start
Destiny told us
There is no doubt
Respect is what it's all about

There's something about us
You can't explain
The only thing we're here for
Is to entertain
Destiny told us
Not to run away
We will make it anyway
