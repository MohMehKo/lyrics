Way down below the ocean where I wanna be she may be,

The continent of Atlantis was an island
Which lay before the great flood
In the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean.
So great an area of land,
That from her western shores
Those beautiful sailors journeyed
To the South and the North Americas with ease,
In their ships with painted sails.

To them East Africa was a neighbour,
Across a short strait of sea miles.
The great Egyptian age is
But a remnant of The Atlantian culture.

Like a cheat who is running away
Seek it deep in the light
I close my eyes to see the light

Way down below the ocean where I wanna be she may be,
Way down below the ocean where I wanna be she may be,

The antediluvian kings colonised the world
All the Gods who play in the mythological dramas
In all legends from all lands were from far Atlantis.

Knowing her fate,
Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth.
On board were the Twelve:
The poet, the physician,
The farmer, the scientist,
The magician and the other so-called Gods of our legends.
Though Gods they were -
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind
Let us rejoice
And let us sing
And dance and ring in the new
Hail Atlantis!

Like a cheat who is running away
Seek it deep in the light
I close my eyes to see the light

Way down below the ocean where I wanna be she may be,
Way down below the ocean where I wanna be she may be,

Like a cheat who is running away
Seek it deep in the light
I close my eyes to see the light

Way down below the ocean where I wanna be she may be,
Way down below the ocean where I wanna be she may be,

My antediluvian baby, oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah,
I wanna see you some day, wanna see you some day.
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, oh yeah
