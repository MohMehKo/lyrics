I heard you went to France 
Did you walk along the seine 
Watched lovers hand in hand 
Did you softly call my name 

When you sat on a bench 
After tuilerie 
And remembered I spoke French 
Did you have an ache for me 

N' when the river of regret 
Rushes passed your door 
Will you give me just a thought 
And wish you loved me more 

Well, forgive me if I dream 
Or hold on to memories 
But sometimes what might have been 
Washes over me 

Then in some dark cafe 
Did you drink a glass of wine 
The colour of my lips 
After kissing you all night 

And my hair was such a mess 
By the time the mornin' came 
You held it off my neck 
Said you liked it best that way 

N' when the river of lost years 
Freezes at your door 
Will you scate across your tears 
Just to touch my face once more 

Well, forgive me if I dream 
Or hold on to memories 
But sometimes what might have been 
Washes over me 

What might have been 
If she hadn't caught your eye 
Would I be the one you'd never leave 
Who would grow old by your side 

Well, forgive me if I dream 
Or hold on to memories 
But sometimes what might have been 
Washes over me 
Washes over me 
I heard you went to france
