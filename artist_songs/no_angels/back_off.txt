Oh no, hold up, wait a minute
I don´t know who you think you´re talkin´ to
Drop that, drop that, stop that, stop that
I will never be what you want me to
I won`t, let you, put me, down no

What makes you think I belong to you
Wake up, before I break up
It´s Insanity

If you think for just a second that you own me
Think again ´cause I will never be your trophy
If you´re lookin´ for a quickie then I´m not the one to talk to

You better back off, back it up
I don´t know what you heard
You better back off, back it up
I´m not that type of boy
I would never let anyone control me
I will hold my fort down
So back off

Don´t touch, hands off, step back, get lost
I don´t believe in them tricks you pull on me
Eaze up, chill out, speak not, still now
Can´t you see that you´re talk is buggin´ me
Go ahead, make a, fool of ,yourself
I will never go home with you

Slow down before it goes down
You can´t handle me

If you think for just a second that you own me
Think again ´cause I will never be your trophy
If you´re lookin´ for a quickie then I´m not the one to talk to

You better back off, back it up
I don´t know what you heard
You better back off, back it up
I´m not that type of boy
I would never let anyone control me
I will hold my fort down
So back off

Watcha lookin´ at who you´re talkin to
I don´t want anything to do with you
Back it up,back it up

If you think for just a second that you own me
Think again ´cause I will never be your trophy
If you´re lookin´ for a quickie then I´m not the one to talk to

You better back off, back it up
I don´t know what you heard
You better back off, back it up
I´m not that type of boy
I would never let anyone control me
I will hold my fort down

I´ll never be your property
No no no no
You´re blockin´ me, you´re stoppin´ me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
