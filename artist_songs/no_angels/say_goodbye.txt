This song goes out to all the man in the world who don't know how to treat a lady!

[Chorus]
Who's sorry now
You'd better learn how to say goodbye
See you later
Now its over
All changes gone
You'd better move on and try to find
Another love, it's time to say goodbye.

[Verse 1]
What is wrong with you, why you acting like a fool
You don't need to hide, all the things you keep inside 
Cause now I know 
Baby I was right, you were playing with my mind
And I already know
So now its time to go
Who's sorry now…

[Verse 2]
All the time I thought, boy I messed it up
Cause you tried to blame me for, not trusting you nomore
But now I see
All the time you lied, all the tears that I have cried
While you where having fun, cause I was not your only one
Who's sorry now…

[Mid 8]
Now I wanna let you know
I don't need you anymore
Cause don't need your lies, now pay the price for tearing up my heart
I don't need your poor excuse, baby this time you will lose 
Cause now I'm strong to carry on, without you by my side
