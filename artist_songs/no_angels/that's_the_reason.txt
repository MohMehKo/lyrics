I'm going through good and bad times
Working hard to live my dreams and I
Don't know if it is the right way
I changed my life in so many ways but

Sometimes I wonder
If I had made it without

The way you love me and support me
Makes me know we'll never part
The way you touch me deep in my soul
That's the reason you're in my heart

The way you need me like I need you
I'm sure we'll never part
The way you feel me and make me smile
That's the reason you're in my heart

In moments of fear and darkness
You covered me with light and hope
And you have to let me know if there is
Something I can do for you yes

Sometimes I wonder
If I had made it without

The way you love me and support me
Makes me know we'll never part
The way you touch me deep in my soul
That's the reason you're in my heart

The way you need me like I need you
I'm sure we'll never part
The way you feel me and make me smile
That's the reason you're in my heart

You're in my heart
