Is it love
Is it real
Is it just another number

In your heart
Do you feel
What is written in your eyes

Boy
If you don't know
You'll never be ready to give me
more than kisses and hugs
Hey

Then I should go
Find somebody who does
Cause I'm

[CHORUS]
Too old for games
Too old to wait
Too old to love you if you're not gonna stay
Too old for charms
Don't break my heart
Take it or leave it
Cause I'm too old

Do you mean what you say
Or do you just like talking
Or does this player wanna play
Just to please his inner child so

If you're sure
You'll never be ready to give me
more than heartache and doubt
Hey
So don't let the door hit you on the way out
Cause I'm

[CHORUS]
Too old for games
Too old to wait
Too old to love you if you're not gonna stay
Too old for charms
Don't break my heart
Take it or leave it
Cause I'm too old

This is your last chance
Time to be a man
Go or take my hand
Cause I'm too old for this
Love me or leave me
Break up or please me
Scream if you need me

This is a song for all you half assed lovers
This is a song for all you half assed lovers
This is a song for all you half assed lovers
Get your act together before I call your mother

[CHORUS]
Too old for games
Too old to wait
Too old to love you if you're not gonna stay
Too old for charms
Don't break my heart
Take it or leave it
Cause I'm too old
