Passion

Sometimes my life just runs so fast
I wish myself back to the past
But since you're mine
I feel so much stronger than I felt before
Oh yeah
No matter where I fall behind
No matter if I lose my mind
You're there and take the pain off of my shoulders
Drying all my tears

You're my passion
You're my guiding light
The shield against the darkest night
You're all I knwo
You're all I need
The shield against my sorrow
You're my passion
You're my guiding light
You're the sun of tomorrow
And you shine so bright
My self-control
My heart and soul
The shield against my sorrow

Life was like a game to me
Not always fair but now I see
There's so much more
Now I'm able to read between the lines
All my faith and confidence
My gift to you
We've got a chance
So what you get is what you see
And I promise I'll be true

You're my passion
You're my guiding light
The shield against the darkest night
You're all I know
You're all I need
The shield against my sorrow
You're my passion
You're my guiding light
You're the sun of tomorrow
And you shine so bright
My self-control
My heart and soul
The shield against my sorrow

And when we argue
And words come out so rough
For every single word, every single word hurt
I'm sorry, so sorry yeah

Passion, passion
The shield against my sorrow

You're my passion
You're my guiding light
The shield against the darkest night
You're all I know
You're all I need
The shield against my sorrow
You're my passion
You're my guiding light
You're the sun of tomorrow
And you shine so bright
My self-control
My heart and soul
The shield against my sorrow

The shield against my sorrow
