I don’t wanna hear another voice
sayin there’s nothing more
I should be the one to make the choice
to open another door
But I was moving in the right direction
I thought I had it all, figured out,
but now I’m feeling like there’s something missing,
I just realised

[Chorus:]
I only got one life, one life!
Tonight I’m gonna live mine, live mine,
I’m gonna have a good time, good time,
I wanna be free.

I only got one life, one life!
Tonight I’m gonna live mine, live mine,
I’m gonna have a good time, good time,
I wanna be free.

Why was I afraid to take a chance, knowing that I am strong?
Take me to the floor and I will dance
watch me go on and on
Yes now I’m heading in the right direction
don’t need to have it all figured out
and when I’m feeling like there’s something missing
I’m gonna remember

[Chorus]

I’m feeling it with confidence
I don’t care about consequence
I’m gonna do what’s best for me
Reaching for my destiny
Hold on - I feel it
I’m pushing to the limit
I’m working my ass off - forever I will bring it

[Chorus]
