I get in it when I'm high strung
I lay back and dream of the Carribean sun
The only place that we all love
Spend half our lives layin in it snug snug

To sleep and eat
Repeat reteat
Sex fast and deep
Recline un-wind
We waste so much time there 'cause it's warm
It's a place we lock the world out

Let's go to bed baby
Let's go to bed
Let's go to bed baby
Let's go to bed
Let's go to bed

John Lennon was my hero
He spoke peace
while layin in bed with Yoko
Sometimes we've gotta go slow
and when I'm ill I'm in with a hot cup of Coco

Duva silk sheets
Night, night can't sleep
Let's count some sheep
Recline un-wind
We waste so much time there 'cause it's warm
It's the place we lock the world out

Let's go to bed baby
Let's go to bed
Let's go to bed baby
Let's go to bed
Let's go to bed

'Cause when I'm tired
I wanna sleep
And when hungry I am gonna eat
Don't wanna sit down in no seat
'Cause when I am ready
Come on let's retire dream about
This funky sound

Let's go to bed baby
Let's go to bed
Let's go to bed baby
Let's go to bed
Let's go to bed
