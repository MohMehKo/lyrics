I've been waiting
For this moment
So won't you come here
Close to me, next to me, baby

When you touch me
When you kiss me
Got me feelin'
This ecstasy is destiny 

You can get me in the zone
Thrill me to the bone
Get me so excited
So why don't we go
Where we've never been before
You can take me higher

You know you got me
Crazy for you
I think I'm goin'
100% emotional

Boy, won't you take me
To the extreme
You got me goin' all night
I feel sensual
100% emotional

Temperature risin'
There's no denyin'
I'm past the point of
No return, body burn, baby

My desire
Is on fire
I want to feel your 
Love for me surrounding me

You can get me in the zone
Thrill me to the bone
Get me so excited
So why don't we go
Where we've never been before
You can take me higher

You know you got me
Crazy for you
