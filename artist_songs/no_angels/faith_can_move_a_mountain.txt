Sitting here at the end of the road
And I don't know what to do
Singing all alone a sad song
This is all do as a rule

But I know there is something that leads me through the dark
And I feel the hope is coming
Is coming back again coming back again
Yes it's coming and I live again

You are the sun in the night
You are my bright guiding light
And if it's raining again
You are by my side by my side, oh oh

And if a mountain's too high
And if a valley's too low
You're giving me power and strength
You are everything
Faith can move a mountain
Oh oh, you are everything
Faith can move a mountain
Oh oh, you are everything everything

Digging down too deep losing my ground
Feel a cold in my heart
Running down the street running all the way
Gotta make a new start

And I promise this time gonna be so true to myself
Then I feel the hope is coming
Is coming back again coming back again
Yes it's coming and I live again

You are the sun in the night
You are my bright guiding light
And if it's raining again
You are by my side by my side, oh oh

And if a mountain's too high
And if a valley's too low
You're giving me power and strength
You are everything
Faith can move a mountain
Oh oh, you are everything
Faith can move a mountain
Oh oh, you are everything everything

Oh oh, you are everything
Faith can move a mountain
Oh oh, you are everything everything

Faith can move a mountain
Faith can move a mountain

And if it's raining again
You are by my side by my side, oh oh

And if a mountain's too high
And if a valley's too low
You're giving me power and strength
You are everything
Faith can move a mountain
Oh oh, you are everything
Faith can move a mountain
Oh oh, you are everything everything

Faith can move a mountain
Digging down too deep losing my ground
Feel a cold in my heart
Faith can move a mountain
Running down the street running all the way
Gotta make a new start
Everything, everything, oh oh

Digging down too deep losing my ground
Feel a cold in my heart
Faith can move a mountain
Running down the street running all the way
Gotta make a new start
