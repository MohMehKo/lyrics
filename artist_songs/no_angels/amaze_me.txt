[Sandy:]
Little things that you do
That we share me and you
Always I breath
You suply me with such wonder stuff
just one touch is all I need

[Jess:]
Feels like the fallin into sun
even old storydays
in everyway
feels like we won
As we watched the years go by
Feels like we´re still flyin' high

[Refrain:]
Baby you amaze me
You still like me, all my fears
Who would I've ever guess
It will last through it all the reason I believe
can´t you see?
you still amaze me
you still amaze me

[Nadja:]
Funny how
everytime that I´m down
you pick me up
you stand by me
When people less
whats the deal
are you still so in love
or maybe it´s meant to be

[Lucy:]
Feels like I'm fallin into sun
even when life is life
A fight
feels like we won
As we watched the years go by
Feels like we´re still flyin' high

Baby you amaze me
You still like me all my fears
Who would I've ever guess
It will last through the only reason I belive
can´t you see?
you still amaze me
you still amaze me
