[Verse 1:]

Just because I left your crazy ass behind me
Doesn´t mean you have to go and do me grimy
Spreading rumors spreading lies is your profession
Like your momma didn´t give you no affection

You know you did it
But I ain´t with it
Don´t try to spin it
Just admit it an quit, you´re finished

[Chorus:]

I wanna shut your mouth, for the lies that you spread on me
Burn your house, and I hope that you´re still asleep
Cut you out, for the b!tch that you have to be
Shut your mouth, before you make me shut your mouth

[Verse 2:]

You keep on talkin´ tryin to ruin my reputation
To see me hurting is your only motivation
Stop pretending all the time that you´re the victim
But you can´t, you need to feed on your addiction

You know you did it
But I ain´t with it
Don´t try to spin it
Just admit it an quit, you´re finished

[Chorus 2x:]

I wanna shut your mouth, for the lies that you spread on me
Burn your house, and I hope that you´re still asleep
Cut you out, for the b!tch that you have to be
Shut your mouth, before you make me shut your mouth

[Bridge:]

I can see
I can see that you still want me
It´s a fact
Oh, it´s a fact that you´re not over me
It´s your fault
It´s your fault that you´re lonely
It´s just so sad to see
Why don´t you let it be

You know you did it
But I ain´t with it
Don´t try to spin it
Just admit it an quit, you´re finished

[Chorus 2x:]

I wanna shut your mouth, for the lies that you spread on me
Burn your house, and I hope that you´re still asleep
Cut you out, for the b!tch that you have to be
Shut your mouth, before you make me shut your mouth
