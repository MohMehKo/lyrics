Stuck here for the weekend
Kickin' on a tincan, out of my mind
Stuck here for indefinete
Talking to myself, half of the time

Stone cold black 'n' blue
My memories of you
Got no future got no plans
Without a clue, what to do

When you lose your love in a dead end town
And there's no place else to go
When the rumours running around and round
And the days go by so slow
I had a feeling
I had a feeling once
Until someone took it away
I had a feeling
I had a feeling once
Until someone took it away
Until someone took it away

Stuck here for the weekend
Looking at too much time to kill
Luck has never found a home
In his not so pleasantville

Stone cold black 'n' blue
You tore me up in two
There's no way out and no way back
Without a clue, what to do

When you lose your love in a dead end town
And there's no place else to go
When the rumours running around and round
And the days go by so slow
I had a feeling
I had a feeling once
Until someone took it away
I had a feeling
I had a feeling once
Until someone took it away
Until someone took it away

All this time I
Prayed for someone else to
Come my way and
Sweep me off my feet yeah
All this time I
Wasted in this dreadful
lonely place that
I once called my home

I had a feeling
I had a feeling once
Until someone took it away
I had a feeling
I had a feeling once
When you lose your love in a dead end town
And there's no place else to go
When the rumours running around and round
And the days go by so slow
I had a feeling
I had a feeling once
Until someone took it away
I had a feeling
I had a feeling once
Until someone took it away
I had a feeling
I had a feeling once
Until someone took it away
Someone took it away
