Lost and by myself all alone
Life can be so cold since you've gone
Haven't seen you for so long I feel so wrong

And here it is begging you come home
Missinng you wanting you come home

I cry for you feeling lost and lonely now
I cry for you you're still the one and only for me
I'll die for you and I miss you so
Cry for you I cry for you

I ran away from those lies that I had told
There was no reason why I was such a fool
And finally I've lost your loving heart and soul

And here it is begging you come home
Missinng you wanting you come home

I cry for you feeling lost and lonely now
I cry for you're still the one and only for me
I'll die for you and I miss you so
Cry for you I cry for you

I miss you like crazy
Come back and stay
I'm never gonna give you up
My heart will break you'll see

I cry for you
I cry for you

And I cry for you feeling lost and lonely now
I cry for you're still the one and only for me
Miss you so
I cry for you
Cry for you
