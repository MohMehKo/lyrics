Tell me baby what you wanna say
Your back again for old times sake
Tell me baby what you trying to do
Listen up cause I'm telling you
You ain't ever coming back again
Make the most of the time we spent
I ain't ever gonna hurt no more

I heard your lies ten times before
You ain't ever coming back again
For no down town diddy

You ain't ever coming back again
You know what
If I break your little heart in two (you know what)
Ain't nothing like the things you do (you know what)
I need a lover who'll be there for me (you know what)
And if it all comes back to you
You know what, so what
You know what
But you never gave a guarantee (you know what)
Gotta tell you that your history
Baby I'm the one who got away

Bet you thought I'd be hear to stay
You know what so what, so what
I don't want you like I did before
Guess I don't need you no more

For no down town diddy
You ain't ever coming back again
You ain't ever coming back again
So get out of my way ...yeah [x4]

Once bit, twice shy, you ain't got no alibi
Tick tock, don't stop, what you got just ain't enough
You know what
If I break your little heart in two (you know what)
You know what, so what
Ain't nothing like the things you do (you know what)
And if it all comes back to you
You know what
I need a lover who'll be there for me (you know what)
