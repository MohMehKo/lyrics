I couldn't care less if you don't love me
I couldn't care less if you don't want me
But I gotta confess that when you abadoned my heart
You know you tore it apart

I guess I'm okay now in every way
I manage somehow since you went away
To find yourself I hope you do
'Cause now now we are through

I couldn't care less if you don't love me
I couldn't care less if you don't want me
But I gotta confess that when you abadoned my heart
You know you tore it apart

I've got my strength back
To go on with my life
The nights are getting shorter now
And days are passing by
And God knows I cried
But now I know I'm finally over you

I couldn't care less if you don't love me
I couldn't care less if you don't want me
But I gotta confess that when you abadoned my heart
You know you tore it apart

Now the loneliness is gone
It's time to move on
'Cause I know that I will make it on my own
'Cause I can smile again
It's more than I could then
It's funny how time can heal a heart

I couldn't care less if you don't love me
I couldn't care less if you don't want me
But I gotta confess that when you abadoned my heart
You know you tore it apart

I couldn't care less if you don't love me
I couldn't care less if you don't want me
But I gotta confess that when you abadoned my heart
You know you tore it apart
