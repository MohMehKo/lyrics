Two steps forward
and three steps back
and I don’t know where we are
you see it your way
and I see it mine
and we’re lost here in the dark

it’s not just a matter of talking it out
you know it don’t mean nothing if there’s something to hide
I know you know just what I’m talking about
There’s an unspoken hesitation we both feel inside

Am I here? Am I gone? Tell me where I belong
All that I need is a reason
Am I wrong? Am I right? Are we saying goodbye?
Give me something to believe in
Because all I need is a reason

It’s complicated and so overrated
To say all we need is love
My baby believe me I wish it was that easy
but sometimes love just ain´t enough

This indecision here is wearing me down
Can’t hold on to something so undefined
And I, I got to know if what was lost can be found
This situation has got me crazy going out of my mind

Am I here? am I gone? tell me where I belong
All that I need is a reason
am I wrong? Am I right? are we saying goodbye?
Give me something to believe in
Because all I need is a reason

If you would only just let your feelings flow
All I need is a reason
I’d be the one who would never let you go
And you’d know I know

All that I need. All I need. All I need.

Am I here? am I gone? tell me where I belong
All that I need is a reason
am I wrong? Am I right? are we saying goodbye?
Give me something to believe in
Because all I need is a reason
