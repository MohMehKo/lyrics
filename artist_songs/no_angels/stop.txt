[Verse 1:]

I know how you roll
First you say you love me
Than say you don´t know
Taking it back slowly
Baby we´ve been down this road an oh yeah
I know how it goes yeah
You say that you´re not like before
And I say okay

Show me baby
Prove that you´re right
Love me baby
Not just tonight
And don´t make any promises
That you can´t keep
The only thing that i want you to do is promise me
That you´ll ...

[Chorus:]

Stop stop stop stop ... etc.
Before you turn it around
Stop stop stop stop ... etc.

[Verse 2:]

Baby I´m no fool
But I wonder why you do
Those crazy things you do
Saying that you love when
You know it isn´t cool yet
You say that it´s true
Yea yea
Maybe you´re really not like before
And I´m just clueless

Show me baby
Prove that you´re right
Love me baby
Not just tonight
And don´t make any promises
That you can´t keep
The only thing that I want you to do is promise me
That you´ll ...

[Chorus:]

Stop stop stop stop ... etc.
Before you turn it around
Stop stop stop stop ... etc.

[Bridge:]

Send me flowers, blow me kisses
Say it´s me that your missin´
Give me luvin´
Til the sun comes up
Until your game is done oh love
Call me daily, write me letters
When I´m sad love makes it better
If you can´t stay with me
Then before you leave me
Promise me that you´ll at least ...

[Chorus:]

Stop ... wait a little longer
Before you let me down
Say you´ll stop ... wait a little longer
Before you turn it around
Before you turn it around

Stop stop stop stop ...
