On and on I’ve tried to move it along
(It won’t stop)
Tried to find the strength to turn it around
(It won’t stop)
Everything’s been off since you went away
And time just broke the promise to ease the pain

Because I need you here
And it’s just not fair
That it won’t get better
Why did you disappear
And we got nowhere
But it won’t stop there
Though you’re gone forever
I can’t make you disappear

Crashing,breaking memories in my mind
(It won’t stop)
Never ever close to getting it right
(It won’t stop)
Best time of my life now it’s washed away
Still the stars they know how to spell your name

Cause I need you here
And it’s just not fair
That it won’t get better
Why did you disappear
And we got nowhere
But it won’t stop there
Though you’re gone forever
I can’t make you disappear

Cause you got into my heart of stone
And I can’t get used to being all alone

Cause I need you here
And it’s just not fair
That it won’t get better
Why did you disappear
And we got nowhere
But it won’t stop there
Though you’re gone forever
I can’t make you disappear
