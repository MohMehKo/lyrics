Don't hesitate, cross the Faith,
You've got the world in your Hands,
lonely to wait,
It's not too late,
Just take your chances, ah
Just take your chances

I get up in the morning
"Hello it's me"
I take a look outside to find out what's the possibility
I shake the boons in the mad way,
Hey hey its a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day

Don't hesitate, cross the Faith,
You've got the world in your Hands,
Lonely to wait,
It's not to late,
Just take your chances, ah
Just take your chances
