Just a little feelgood lie 
Check your alibi 

Everybody tells a little story 
Everybody tells a white lie 
Sometimes you gotta be careful 
Gotta check your reasons why 
Guess you do what you gotta do (Better watch your back) 
Say what you say (Be careful boy) 

Everybody got a little secret 
Everybody got a darker side 
Did you think I wouldn't see right through it 
Your alligator tears are dry 
Gotta say where you're gonna be (Better watch your back) 
Where you?re coming from (Be careful boy) 
Better run away, I don't wanna play 
Who needs it anyway 

You think you're irresistable 
So hot it's unbelievable 
I'm thinking you're just predictable 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Better check your alibi 
When you look me in the eye 
Make 'em real good lies 
Like them feelgood lies 
Think I'm messing with your plan 
I don't really give a damn 
'bout them real good lies 
Them feelgood lies 

Come down, get a little real 
Find something that can work for you 
You ain't no superhero 
Just a faker with an attitude 
Be who you're gonna be (Better watch your back) 
Come clean (Be careful boy) 
Better run away, I don't wanna play 
Who needs it anyway 

You think you're irresistable 
So hot it's unbelievable 
I'm thinking you're just predictable 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Better check your alibi 
When you look me in the eye 
Make 'em real good lies 
Like them feelgood lies 
Think I'm messing with your plan 
I don't really give a damn 
'bout them real good lies 
Them feelgood lies
