I'm givin' up, I'm givin' in
This is a battle that I can't win
Time's runnin' out - love's runnin' off
Everything's slowly witherin'
Away...love's runnin' off...away from me

And you're right by my side
But my hands are tied
I can't make you change your mind
And my heart's payin' the price...of fallin'

And I don't wanna talk about it - I'm all out of words
There's nothing left sayin' we both haven't heard
I don't even wanna go there - I just want out
I made up my mind - cleared all the doubts

'Cause I'm stuck on a one way street
Makin' it impossible for us to meet
So I don't wanna talk about it

Learnin' to stand - learnin' to walk
Learnin' to live all over
Again...tryin' my wings...again...and though

I'm right by your side
But you're hands are tied
You can't make me change my mind
And our hearts pay the price...of fallin'

And I don't wanna talk about it - I'm all out of words
There's nothing left sayin' we both haven't heard
I don't even wanna go there - I just want out
I made up my mind - cleared all the doubts

Don't wanna cry - just wanna try to forget
All out of air - I don't know where to begin
No I don't wanna cry - just wanna try to forget
'Cause it hurts when you start
Thinkin' of what could have been

And I don't wanna talk about it - I'm all out of words
There's nothing left sayin' we both haven't heard
I don't even wanna go there - I just want out
I made up my mind - cleared all the doubts
