Hey... oh 

The best time I ever had
When you were mine so do myself to keepin' me 
Never let you go, but trains and boats and airplanes
Took me away (away) from you (Uuh) 

Away from all the love we had
From all the things we shared 
And tell me, what can I do? 
You're always on my mind

If I could sing my song to you
I'd tell you, how my heart is broken too 
From any corner of the world, I let you know
I'll always be your girl 
I'm still in love with you

Lonely days and lonely nights
Since you've been gone I miss your touch
I miss your smile always by my side
I think about the times we had
And now I'm wonder why (why) oh why (Oh why) 

Boy you had to steal my heart 
When we were world apart 
So tell me, baby what should I do? 
You're always on my mind 

If I could sing my song to you
I'd tell you how my heart is broken too 
From any corner of the world, I let you know
I'll always be your girl 
I'm still in love with you

I'm still in love with you 

If I could sing my song to you, oh baby 
You know my heart is true, you're always on my mind

If I could sing my song to you
I'd tell you how my heart is broken too 
From any corner of the world, I let you know
I'll always be your girl 
I'm still in love with you
If I could sing my song to you
I'd tell you how my heart is broken too 
From any corner of the world, I let you know
I'll always be your girl 
I'm still in love with you

Still in love 
I'm still in love with you 
Still in love with you 
I'm still in love with you
