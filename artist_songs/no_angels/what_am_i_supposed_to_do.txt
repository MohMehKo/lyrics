What am I supposed to do
If I know I have to live without you

Deep down in my soul it looks so sad
Can't still imagine this would be the end

I'm so in need
Can't help myself

Please tell me boy
There's no-one else

I wanna be your one and only
I hope you feel the same for me

Baby think twice before you leave my life
Remember the past and all the fun we had

What am I supposed to do
If I know I have to live without you
I have to live without you
Going round and round in circles
Just to clear my mind again cause of you

Deep down in my heart it seems so dark
Can't still believe you wanna leave me now

I'm so in love
In love with you

Don't say goodbye
Don't let me fall

I wanna be the love in you
And here I swear my heart belongs to you

Baby think twice before you leave my life
Remember the past and all the fun we had

What am I supposed to do
If I know I have to live without you
Going round and round in circles
Just to clear my mind again cause of you

What am I supposed to do
If I know I have to live without you
Going round and round in circles
Just to clear my mind again cause of you

Do you think of me
Like the way I do
Lord only knows
I'm telling you the truth

Do you think of me baby
Like the way I do
Lord only knows
I'm telling you the truth

What am I supposed to do
If I know I have to live without you
Going round and round in circles
Just to clear my mind again cause of you

What am I supposed to do
If I know I have to live without you
Going round and round in circles
Just to clear my mind again cause of you

What am I supposed to do
If I know I have to live without you
Going round and round in circles
Just to clear my mind again cause of you

What am I supposed to do
If I know I have to live without you
