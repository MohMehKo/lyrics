I can´t live with you, I can´t live without you
Boy I love you and I hate you the same
You´re unhealthy but I still gotta have ya
Like a Drug that I inject in my vein
And sometimes it feels wrong
But Sometimes it feels right
I lie to myself but you´re still on my mind
So fed up, we break up, then make up, once again
The clouds build up over our heads

[Chorus:]
It´s like a thunderstorm
All we do is fight then take it to a new extreme
it´s like a thunderstorm
This ain´t going nowhere
Someone get me out of the rain
I´m stuck in a thunderstorm
I´m stuck in a Thunderstorm

Everyday I ask myself if it´s worth it
But you´re grippin so I can´t get away
When I do you pull me back like a magnet
It´s pychotic how you fuck with my brain
And I know that it´s wrong
but sometimes it feels right
You lie to my face then you get me from behind
So fed up, we make up, once we get out of bed
it starts pouring down on us again

[Bridge:]
I need some shelter from the storm that´s surrounding me
the rain is pouring down, ican´t see in front of me
Everytime I think of you I´m in misery
Why won´t you let me be...

[Chorus:]
It´s like a thunderstorm
All we do is fight then take it to a new extreme
it´s like a thunderstorm
This ain´t going nowhere
Someone get me out of the rain
I´m stuck in a thunderstorm
I´m stuck in a Thunderstorm
