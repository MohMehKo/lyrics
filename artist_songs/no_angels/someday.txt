I believe we've come to where there's no turning back 
It's a one-way street and it seems like we're trapped 
In a way, I know that things have been going on for too long 
It's become too much, it's so hard to go on 
But I'm not the one who walks away that easily 
I try to believe in love, try so hard to be in love 

Someday, in another time and place 
With a brighter, stronger flame 
We'll make it right 
In some way, there can be a miracle 
Our love can still be magical 
I know that we can make it right 

I used to think that U had been sent from above 
That we were meant to be, forever U and me 
Day by day went by and somewhere we went wrong 
And our devotion's been gone from that moment and on 
But I'm not the one who walks away easily 
I try to believe in love, try so hard to be in love 

Someday, in another time and place 
With a brighter, stronger flame 
We'll make it right 
In some way, there can be a miracle 
Our love can still be magical 
I know that we can make it right 

Cause deep inside my heart and mind 
I truly think that love is blind 
I know there can be miracles 
Our love can still be magical 
I know that we can make it right
