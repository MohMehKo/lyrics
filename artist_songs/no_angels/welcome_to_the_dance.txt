[Verse 1:]
Sexy Baby
What´s goin´ on
I hear the music playin´
Ain´t this your favorite song
Why aren´t you dancin´ (Why aren´t you dancin´)
You should be dancin´ (You should be dancin´)
Get on the floor

[Pre - Chorus:]
The floor is primed
Waiting on your arrival
Come on it´s time
Hey this is your recital
Get to movin´
I like the way you movin´

[Chorus:]
Welcome to the dance
Baby, welcome to it
This is your chance at love tonight
Baby let´s just do it
Get off the wall
And hit the floor
Show the people whatcha came in here for
Welcome to the dance
Welcome to it

[Verse 2:]
Dancin´ baby (Hey)
Get in the zone
I feel the vibe you´re sending
I thought you take control
Baby you got me (You got me)
Wantin´ too see you movin´

[Pre - Chorus:]
The floor is primed
Waiting on your arrival
Come on it´s time
Hey this is your recital
Get to movin´
I like the way you movin´

[Chorus:]
Welcome to the dance
Baby, welcome to it
This is your chance at love tonight
Baby let´s just do it
Get off the wall
And hit the floor
Show the people whatcha came in here for
Welcome to the dance
Welcome to it

[Bridge 2x:]
Move it
I know you can do it
Work ya lane to it
Keep rockin´ the music

[Chorus:]
Welcome to the dance
Baby, welcome to it
This is your chance at love tonight
Baby let´s just do it
Get off the wall
And hit the floor
Show the people whatcha came in here for
Welcome to the dance
Welcome to it
