You see a book by it's cover
I see the pages that we've yet to write
You see the world with no color
I see a rainbow inside of your eyes

I remember the time when you brought the sun to my day
Where did you hide all of the beautiful sky
Cuz now it's just pouring like rain

[CHORUS]
It's like we derailed
Baby,just tell me where we failed
So we can go back to the good days
Before love got off of our train
And we fell off track

We fell off,fell off
Fell off the track
We fell off,fell off
Baby,come back
We fell off,fell off
Fell off the track and Derailed

Somehow you lost your direction
We were so close then you fell far behind
Never had to ask for affection
Used to be strong now you don't even try

I remember the time when i had a smile on my face
You shouldn't hide the fact that you love inside
Please don't drift too far away

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE]

What is it gonna take to go back in time
Just press rewind,cuz i hate this feeling
You still have a chance to make all this right with me

It's like we derailed
Baby,just tell me did i fail to love you
Cuz i'm still here,waiting for you at our station

It's like we derailed
Baby,just tell me where we failed
So we can go back

We fell off,fell off
Fell off the track
We fell off,fell off
Baby,come back
We fell off,fell off
We're not supposed to be derailed

You see a book by it's cover
I see the story that we used to write
