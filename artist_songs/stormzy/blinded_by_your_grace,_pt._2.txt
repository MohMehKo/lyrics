[Stormzy:]
I'm blinded by your grace
I'm blinded by your grace, by your grace
I'm blinded by your grace
I'm blinded by your

[Stormzy & MNEK:]
Lord I've been broken
Although I'm not worthy
You fixed me, now I'm blinded
By your grace
You came and saved me
Lord I've been broken
Although I'm not worthy
You fixed me, now I'm blinded
By your grace
You came and saved me

[Stormzy:]
One time for the Lord
And one time for the cause
And one round of applause
One time for Fraser T Smith on the chords
I feel we got one
I stay prayed up then I get the job done
Yeah I'm Abigail's yout, but I'm God's son
But I'm up now, look at what God's done
Now I real talk, look at what God did
On the main stage runnin' 'round topless
Phone Flipz and I tell him that he got this
This is God's plan, they can never stop this
Like... wait right there, can you stop my verse?
You saved this kid and I'm not your first
It's not by blood and it's not by birth
But oh my God what a God I serve

[Stormzy & MNEK:]
Lord I've been broken
Although I'm not worthy
You fixed me, now I'm blinded
By your grace
You came and saved me
Lord I've been broken
Although I'm not worthy
You fixed me, now I'm blinded
By your grace
You came and saved me

[MNEK:]
I said a prayer this morning
I prayed I would find the way
To another day, I was so afraid
'Til you came and saved
You came and saved me
And the rain was pouring
'Cause the sun faded away
Now I'm in a better place
No longer afraid
Blinded by your grace
You came and saved me
I said a prayer this morning
I prayed I would find the way
To another day, I was so afraid
'Til you came and saved
You came and saved me
And the rain was pouring
'Cause the sun faded away
Now I'm in a better place
No longer afraid
Blinded by your grace
You came and saved me

[Stormzy & MNEK:]
Lord I've been broken
Although I'm not worthy
You fixed me, now I'm blinded
By your grace
You came and saved me
Lord I've been broken
Although I'm not worthy
You fixed me, now I'm blinded
By your grace
You came and saved me
