[Ghetts (Bashy):]
(I know, my cousin Stanaman, he's told me a couple stories about you)
I'm not gonna lie-I'm not gonna lie, I'm getting mad right now, what's he talking about? Like banging in cells and that, what you talking about?
(Come on, man, this is just lyrics, blud, Ghetto, this is just lyrics, blud, all about lyrics, blud, all about lyrics, I know, Ghetto, I know, come on)
Easy, easy, aight, easy, easy
Talking that talk, I was a fucking bad boy in jail! A fucking bad boy, you fucking pussy
Is man mad though?
Ask Stanaman, I was a fucking bad boy
Is man mad though?
Ahh, man, do your research
Oi, where's Carlos, where's Carlos?
Ask him how man was in jail about
Fucking truth, stick to the truth
Stick to the fucking truth

[Stormzy:]
Yo, yo, them man are selective bad boys
Some "we just wanna be accepted" bad boys
Some big whips but no electric bad boys
Think they're bad 'cause of Narcos, they're some Netflix bad boys
I know real shower man, you know reckless bad boys
You know them protein shake in their breakfast bad boys
Them man are some "Bro, could you get me on the guest list?" bad boys
And then they wanna get up in the club and start flexing bad boys
Give me the crown, man, I want that
Red Bull with the cognac
I tried to share my throne with 'em
But I can see you ain't on that
I'm on arms, on combat
No trace, no contact
Bro bought a new mash, I don't know where that gun there's cool but it's long akh
Bad boy who? You are not part of a bad boy crew
Me and Flipz roll up, tell a man hold up
Looking like something off of Bad Boys 2
Bad boy Gs in a bad boy shoot (Shoot)
You are not a bad boy, move
Shut down shows and the mandem go nuts
All the bad chicks make mad noise too
Look fuckboy, what you gonna say? What you gonna do, run?
Ah yeah right, you ain't gonna do none
Bad boy life ain't all that you hoped for
Should've done book but you went and done guns
Charge three for a Z, that's banter
Black whip, all black swag like a panther
Heard through the vine that Stormz' ain't a bad boy
But I take care of my fam, I'm a gangster
Yeah that's right, just a young boy in the hood
Fast forward, now I'm Big Mike, still away from the hype
Niggas weren't bad back then, nah it's cons man, I swear on my life
Put faith in my knife
Wrong move had me on edge on the back-road, paying for my stripes
So fuck these niggas, all these little gun drillers wanna come and try do me like Trife

[J Hus:]
You're not bad, I'm bad, ask Carlos
How they gonna harm us?
Came wearing a flat-cap, looking like somebody's father
I brought the bad man here, I brought the bad man here
You're a bad man how? Bad man where?
Apart from you, there's bad man here
You're not bad, I'm bad, ask Carlos
How they gonna harm us?
Came wearing a flat-cap, looking like somebody's father
I brought the bad man here, I brought the bad man here
You're a bad man how? Bad man where?
Apart from you, there's bad man here

[Ghetts:]
Yeah, I'm fully on with your half on
I've done dirt, no mask on
Eighteen when I told man "Ask Carlos"
Now they ask how much man's car cost
Drive-by ting
Aim for your head and convert 'em with your hard-top
Your leg's sick, your heart stops
That's a M case, nah dog
Not me
Not there, not G
I put bread on my beef like Soulja
You've got rice, I've got keys, I told you already
My nigga I don't know you from any
Where, big spare that'll go through your belly
There, payback but you don't owe me a penny, yeah
Fuck that, fist fight, fair and square
Na fuck that, flick-knife, rer and ter
Na fuck that, this guy's wearing his share
Might come back, midnight, air in the [?]
Deal with the matter like Skibba
How's he gonna feel when I'm shattering his liver?
Blud I feel for a man up in the river
Fourteen, holding my shank in the mirror
Like I dare anyone
Playground looking like a [?] anthem, where's everyone?
I ain't scared of you but I'm scared of your gun (I am)
Frightening, that's when I got my ting
It was all calm before Stormzy, now it's lightning

[J Hus:]
You're not bad, I'm bad, ask Carlos
How they gonna harm us?
Came wearing a flat-cap, looking like somebody's father
I brought the bad man here, I brought the bad man here
You're a bad man how? Bad man where?
Apart from you, there's bad man here
You're not bad, I'm bad, ask Carlos
How they gonna harm us?
Came wearing a flat-cap, looking like somebody's father
I brought the bad man here, I brought the bad man here
You're a bad man how? Bad man where?
Apart from you, there's bad man here
