[Wretch 32:]
Woke up on my crucifix again
Was up all night praying for revenge
I don't need more enemies for friends
Tell me how much times can I kill this game for them
But I still love these yout's
21 Gun Salute
Fuck wi' you
21 Gun Salute
I put my trust in you
21 Gun Salute
Would you share your last bullet with me if there weren't any more gun salutes?

[Stormzy:]
Yeah, okay, our father who are in Heaven
Know that I pray that I still stay repping
Pray for my bros and the pagans souls who turn their nose every time I step in
Know that I pray that my bro stops betting
Man that roulette machine won't let him
And I can't wait 'til I say 'I do' and the bros say 'Brap', gun shots at my wedding
You know how we do, flex on occasions, no more food
Left it with Satan, Lord you know I'm a different person but Lord why do they test my patience?
Please can I bun my zoot in peace?
21 Gun Salute for these neeks
I don't ever wanna be like them so I say this prayer every time I go sleep
And it goes like this
