[Lily Allen & Stormzy:]
I'm sorry that I'm late
And I missed your call
But you know night turn into day
I didn't stop to pause
I know I never see your face
And baby, that's my fault
But I'ma fix all my mistakes
So don't stress no more

You got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down
You got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down

[Stormzy:]
You don't ever let me down
Got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down
All those other girls just look
They ain't never takin' your crown
And, girl I know it gets on your nerves sometimes
When I don't answer my phone
And yeah I double back on my words at times
But please don't start with that tone, 'cause girl
I love you, you know, but I can't be there
But when I get home, just roll my weed, yeah
What's mine is yours, give you space to breathe here
Just weed and cush, that's a major key here
Yeah, then you play me a song
Smokin' smoke 'til we're wavy and gone
Come home from a long hard day with the dons
Like where's my baby? I'm sorry it's been long

[Kehlani:]
As much as you think you're alone in the way that you feel
I come home every day when it rain but it's real
Between us, ground so far beneath us, sometimes I can't read ya
But it don't mean I won't treat ya to a blunt full of that reefer
We may get in fights but I could never see me leavin'
Somethin' 'bout how close the high can bring us, sober just don't please us
If you're wondering, yeah, I'm still here because I see us
But Mary makes it easy to talk to you
Aww, yeah, 'cause sometimes I just can't spill my thoughts to you (I took you in every day)
At the end of every day I belong to you (Belong to you)
I'll still pass the bong to you
I'll write a song to you
I'll do no wrong to you

'Cause you don't ever let me down
I won't ever let you down
'Cause you don't ever let me down
I can't ever let you down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

[Stormzy:]
It's been like a month now
Since you left my side
Got me smokin' a blunt now
But there ain't no vibe
'Cause I fucked up badly
All I did was push
And there's no more weed
No more cush
And I'm deep in the south side
And I can't find love
I was lookin' for my brown skin
Tryna find that buzz
Now what have you done, Stormz?
Now what have you caused?
And we weren't just bredrens
We were so much more
Girl you was my hero
The beat to my heart
And them tears on your face
Man they tear me apart
Man I just wanna fix you
Fix what I broke
No cuddles on the sofa
No more smoke
And I pray God saves you
Man I pray all night
I just wanna say thank you
'Cause you saved my life
But I cut you deep
And I know how it looks
Now there's no more weed
No more cush
No more cush

No more cush, yeah
Now there's no more cush
No more cush
