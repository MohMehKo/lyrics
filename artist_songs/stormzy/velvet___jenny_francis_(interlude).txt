[Stormzy:]
Yeah, alright, yeah
Yo, you just wanna know what it feels like
You don't know what you want but it feels right
And you ain't even my girl but we still tight
All your man took you, damn aw sick that's nang
Let me put you on a real flight
Yeah, welcome to the trill life
That views in the shard then I go and book a car
Then we go and get a meal life
You're tryna' look into my soul and see the real Mike
I got a long term plan, I'm a long term man
I'm just tryna' get the deal right
But my issue is pride
If I ever told you I missed you, I lied
Screaming at my phone like "I wish you would try"
Poison love, I kiss you I die
You get mad, get pissed and you cry
Then you making one wish and send a kiss to the sky
I can't lie man, I wish you were mine
But the truth is I ain't got the tissue or time

I can show you my dirty little secrets
Promise me you're always gonna keep it, girl
Tell me that you love me, you're the sweetest
I didn't want to love you but I beat it girl
I grow fonder, girl I grow fonder
I grow fonder, girl I grow fonder

[NAO:]
A touch of the wind and it's gone
I wish I could help it
Into my window of calm
One only to take the flame
To the bridge of dawn
It feels just like velvet
A touch of the wind and it's gone
Ooo then it's gone

[Stormzy:]
So how would you feel if a brother stayed around?
Taking care of you and not the other way around
Fell too deep, now we're both 6 feet
Baby I can barely breathe, could you suffocate me now?
I don't wanna sell a dream you can't afford
I can take you round the city when you're bored
Maybe when you finish your degree, we'll go abroad
Your ex man never gave you nothing, he's a fraud

Can you tell me what it feels like?
Tell me what it feels like
Welcome to the sweet life
Baby welcome to the sweet life

Look, hanging up the phone on me, girl you're too bright
You got a hold on me, girl you're too tight
We can go from Paris to Rome in two nights
If I'm gonna do it then I gotta do it right, alright
I will never ever lead you astray
That's all I never needed to say
The boys wanna tease at my faith
That's just another reason to pray
And if you ever needed me to stay
I'll always be a phone call away
Breathtaking, I'll blow you away
Girl just face it, I know how you stay

If I tell you my every little interest
Thinking of you every time I rinse this, girl
But loving you is easier, the simplest
Running through the world you're my princess girl
I grow fonder, girl I grow fonder
I grow fonder, girl I grow fonder

[NAO:]
A touch of the wind and it's gone
I wish I could help it
Into my window of calm
One only to take the flame
To the bridge of dawn
It feels just like velvet
A touch of the wind and it's gone
Ooo then it's gone

[Stormzy:]
Yeah, alright alright alright, okay okay okay
Man thought that Stormzy couldn't sing [laughs]
Yo, it feels just like velvet
A touch of the wind and it's gone
I wish I could help it
Into my window of calm
To the bridge of dawn
It feels just like velvet
A touch of the wind and it's gone
Ooo then it's gone, then it's gone
Then it's gone, ooo then it's gone
A touch of the wind and it's gone
Ooo then it's gone

[Jenny Francis:]
Oh yeah, I definitely loved that one
That was Stormzy, with the smoochy "Velvet"
On #Merky FM
I'm Jenny Francis, hope you're well. Right!
It's time for another
Here's "Mr. Skeng", crank it up, sit on it
And let it move ya
