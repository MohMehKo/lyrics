You're my sweet black angel
Laughing on my shoulder
Always taking special care of me
You live with me in the night and in the day
And it's your world
You and me
You're an angel
You see only what you wish to see

Where's my sweet black angel
Laughing on my shoulder
Your world is my saviour
It's all that I live for
And it's your world
You live with me night and day
And it's eating my whole heart away

Look at my skin shine
Look at my skin glow
Look at my skin laugh
Look at my skin cry

I'm tired of doing things for others, who give nothing in return 
Take a vow with my sweet angel
You're everything I do deserve
When you smile
Just a little bit
You're all I need
You and my philosophy
I am a simple messenger
I can help you if you please
I want you
To be
All I need to be
Yes!!
