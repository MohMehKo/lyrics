Physically I resemble a vulture 
Too close to meaning
When the world is telling me 
Don't go
And I can't even sell myself.
The moods of a foreigner
And the beating(s) of a train conductor
Physically I resemble a dog 
No bones for this one
When the butcher is out for me 
Don't go.

And I can't even save myself
And you're brutality is obvious to me,
Please chorus inside of me
I am going to break up every part of her,
Not here inside me.
I want to break up every (break up every part of her) 
not here
Physically, you resemble a swan.

Your femininity or girlish appeal,
I don't know?
And she can't even save herself.
You were going nowhere 
now you're way down here with me.
Please chorus when the one has been overthrown,
The way you look at me from an open fire.
I could have died
Although I am alright now you're twisted,
Determined and begging for peace chorus
Determined and begging for peace chorus
