Feel it closin' in
Sweet European you know
Been waiting for this day to come
It's getting out of hand now and you know
Hey hey you're moving something now
From here in isolation
I don't want you
He's up to your hips again
I don't want your
Sweet hesitation and you know
You lost all your friends
And now you want to invent some
And you used to feel so proud

Now it's going under ground
Although it makes you very angry
You don't want it watered down
You'll do it again sometime
You're up to your hips again
I can't stand no goodbye forevers now
What if I don't get it right
Couldn't stand to feel so used
I feel you're movin' something now
From here in isolation
We'll do it again sometime
You're up to your hips again
