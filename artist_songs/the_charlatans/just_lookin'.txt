I'm just lookin' to see what I'm missing, 
You startin' the riot, 
Ten green bottles fly down from the hillside, 
You're too young to stay quiet. 
Find a seat on your own train, 
I wanna share it only with you, 
Sail on for my sweet dreamer, 
I'll never take it away from you. 
Yeah we stand with our hands in the air, 
And we're feelin' so good cos we care, 
And we're freakin' about in the bush, 
Feelin' good feelin' high its a rush, 
Count me in because i don't wanna work, 
In no place in the whole universe. 
I'm just lookin' to see what i'm missing, 
You started the riot, 
Pretty soon I'll be blowin' to match you, 
It's too dull and too quiet. 
I bet you talk about freedom, 
And then throw it to the sea, 
You better smile on for my sweet dreamer, 
You'll never take it away from me. 
'Cause we stand with our hands in the air, 
And we're feelin' so good 'cause we care, 
And we're freakin' about in the bush, 
Feelin' good feelin' high it's a rush,
I'm in because I don't wanna work, 
In no place in the whole universe. 
Just lookin' I bet you talk about freedom, 
And then throw it to the sea, 
You better smile on for my sweet dreamer, 
You'll never take it away from me. 
Just lookin'
Just lookin' 
Just lookin' 
Just lookin'
