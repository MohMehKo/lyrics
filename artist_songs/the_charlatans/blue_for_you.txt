I met you
A long time ago
I knew straight away
You were a one man show
Why couldn't you wait until tomorrow
Why could you lead and not follow

I'm blue for you
I am blue for you
I'm blue for you
I am blue for you

You were a hero to me
And I showed you my soul
By the river I shook
As truth was told
Boy where do you sleep tonight

I'm blue for you
I am blue for you
I'm blue for you
I am blue for you

Where are you now?
My long lost friend
I hope that I will see you again
Why couldn't you wait until tomorrow
Why could you lead and not follow

I'm blue for you
I am blue for you
I'm blue for you
I am blue for you
