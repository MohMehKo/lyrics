Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful
Loving you is simple 'cause you're beautiful

If my time has come,
I'll take it to a place without a wall
To confide in my objections
And to answer to my call
There is no-one here beside me
No-one here no soul at all
Loneliness I fear is me
but with you I shall stand tall

Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful
Loving you is simple 'cause you're beautiful

Don't waste my time,
My time has come
Look at all the things I've said and done
With my hands in my pocket
Hands in my pocket
And I,
I think I'm done
Done all the things that are said and done
With my hands in my pocket
Hands in my pocket

Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful
Loving you is simple 'cause you're beautiful
Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful
Loving you is simple 'cause you're beautiful
Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful
