When I was a little child
What you'd call a runaway
Find me with a latch and key
Crawling in the dirt

There's a problem just for me
I have a thousand worlds to see
Always one for running wild
And dressing up to be like you

Oh vanity, oh vanity
Will keep me from insanity
This heart of mine would rather die
Than live a life of humanity

And now I'm all grown up to be
A paranoid schizophrenic
My friends are all like me and you
I cannot tell em what to do

There's another world to see
Lie down with dogs and you'll get fleas
When Paris gave her hand to me
It felt like an eternity

Now as I feel I'm growing up
It's like a drug
It's like a drug

Oh promise me oh promise me
You'll save the one last dance for me

Oh promise me oh promise me
You'll save the one last dance for me

Oh promise me oh promise me
You'll save the one last dance for me

Oh vanity oh vanity
You'll save the one last dance for me

Oh promise me oh promise me
You'll save the one last dance for me

Oh promise me oh promise me
You'll save the one last dance for me
