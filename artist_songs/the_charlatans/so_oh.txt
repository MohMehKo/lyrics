So Oh
So Oh
Oh Oh

Some other night
And I’m lying on my back
Looking up
And I can’t see the stars for the trees
And I’m sitting now, thinking, 
just wondering where I’ve been

So Oh
So Oh
Oh Oh

So Oh
So Oh
Oh Oh

I watch from my seat
And I thought I saw the lights
Through the clouds I got the sunset
The world just might'a changed

Following the lines of latitude
I hit the ground
Just landed
Following ascension gaining altitude
I'm sitting in a tin can, just to find you

So Oh 
So Oh 
In love

City lights (So Oh)
you and me 
And the free (So Oh)
Summer
On a high (So Oh) 
walking to
Summer place (So Oh)
Summer
