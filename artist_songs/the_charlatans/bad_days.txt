I get these bad days baby
I just don't know
I'm in my own world honey
I don't know
And You can play me
In a world of fools
'Cause You know that You're no friend of mine

I get these bad dreams lately
I just don't know
There's a death cloud hanging
Over You
It's been too long since I
Told You
You're no friend of mine

I get these bad days baby
I just don't know
I'm in my own world honey
I don't know
And You can play me
In a world of fools
'Cause You know that You're no friend of mine

I get these bad dreams lately
I just don't know
There's a death cloud hanging
Over You
It's been too long since I
Told You
You're no friend of mine

Playing dead under the covers, I don't feel like ever waking up
Playing dead under the covers, I don't feel like ever making up

Oh We could never be desperate
I feel
So much younger than yesterday

I get these bad days baby
I just don't know
I'm in my own world honey
I don't know
And You can play me
In a world of fools
'Cause You know that You're no friend of mine

I get these bad dreams lately
I just don't know
You have a death cloud hanging
Over You
It's been a long time since I
Told You
You're no friend of mine

Oh
We Could be end love
Oh
Younger than yesterday
