Staring
Staring further away
Won't you help me
Help me live for the day

Cry yourself to sleep my little girl
Don't you cry for me
but for the rest of the world

Won't you be my lady
Won't you be my lady
Lady now

Stay here
Don't wish your life away
Heaven help me
Help me to live through the day

Cry yourself to sleep my little girl
Don't you cry for me
but for the rest of your world

And all the things they said
Playing tricks with your head
(Won't you be my lady?)
Now I sit here all alone like a king with no throne
(Won't you be my lady?)
Lady now

Won't you come home
Na na na, na na na

And all the things they said
Playing tricks with your head
(Won't you be my lady?)
Now I sit here all alone like a king with no throne
(Won't you be my lady?)
Lady now
