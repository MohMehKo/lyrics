I don't think you quite know who I am
I am the son of loyalty I hope you understand
I don't think you quite know who I am oh
I am the sum of everything I don't want you to understand

You cross my path I'll take you down
You bloodied me with howling hands
The wretched games the tortured souls
The flowing scarves the debutantes
The crushing blows the sordid scenes
But what you did was so obscene

I will ride again and I'll take you down like that
You will die up there alone, I'll take you down like that

You think about me everyday
You dream of ways to keep your evil thoughts at bay
You think about me everyday
You dream of ways to keep your sick-o thoughts at bay

You cross my path I'll take you down
You bloodied me with howling hands
The wretched games the tortured souls
The flowing scarves the debutantes
The crushing blows the sordid scenes
But what you did was so obscene

I will rise again and I'll take you down like that
You will die up there alone, I'll take you down like that

I will sail into your kingdom,be the sound of the abyss could be the sound of your own voice, be the sound of your first kiss
I am the sound of Iraq, I am the sound of the red sea, I am the force of the almighty
I am the sound of your own dreams

You cross my path I'll take you down
You bloodied me with howling hands
The wretched games the tortured souls
The flowing scarves the debutantes
The crushing blows the sordid scenes
But what you did was so obscene

I will ride again and I'll take you down like that
You will die up there alone, I'll take you down like that

I will die for no one I will cry for no one
You will die up there alone you will die up there alone

I'll get you I'll get you
