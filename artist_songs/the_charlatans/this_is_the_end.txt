This is the end
I'll take a bow
With one reprise
Where I come from I don't see the sun
With friends I've followed [?]
I wandered lonely as a cloud
Ooh
'Cause I never

I looked
Through the stars
This is the end

This is the end
of all I know
Can't let you tell me what to do
Oh I will never be put down

Oh I will never be put down
Oh I will only be set free
This is the end for You and me

This is the end
I'll say goodbye
The final curtain

I look at all the amputees,
On the strip
And think, this is the end

This is the end of all I know
Can't let You tell me what to do
Oh I will never be put down

Oh I will never be put down
Oh I only want to be set free
This is the end for You and me

This is the end
I'll take a bow
With one last reprise
