How can you say love surrounds me?
When you know it drowns me
Drowns me like you do
And you see
I am sitting for you
Waiting on you
Just like I do

How can you say love surrounds me and you?
You kill me
And break my poor heart up in two

It's dead love
Dead love
Dead love

How can you say love is in you?
When you know you feel like the way you do
And you see
What you're doing to me
Take a chance now
I'll come to you
How can you say my life is like your own?
When you break down in your own world, I'll be gone

It's dead love
Dead love
Dead love
It's dead love
Dead love
Dead love
