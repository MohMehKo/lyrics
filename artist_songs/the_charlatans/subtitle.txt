Mouth like sugar shiver finger-lashes stick on
I don't know how to get off on this
You're not the same as everybody else.
Why talk to her most song shambles.
Pick on normal hang on(s) stick on
I don't know how to get off on her
You're not the same as everybody else.
Why talk to her an observation taken on, our way on.

A body kiss for you and I am straight on
I don't prescribe the why's outside,
I weigh up all the ghost.
You're not the same as everybody else

Why talk to her mouth like sugar shiver rant on worship heaven
One on - one eye - with eye wankers over workers
What I want I hang on I have negative unbalance my guts
Where they are not dumb to these false leaders anymore
And now you want to achieve another worthless defeat.

Welcome here the heroes
They're on their way home
The end of everything 
You're dead in me forever
They only want a "yes-man"
They tell you what to believe and no 
Yes I do I only want to be strong
