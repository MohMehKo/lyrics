Here comes a soul saver on your record player floatin' about in the dust, you can sing the joys baby,
I'll be down when you're free from the rust,
Take your pick who's your saviour come in five different flavours.
Tell me I'm sweeter than your broken leader
I'll take the smooth with the rough,
I see you lying there,
Put him down no reply in the sand; in the mud.
Don't kick it I wanna keep it,
Don't feel it I wanna drive in the sunshine of your life,
In the sunshine of my life can you feel it when it's right? 

Can you feel it in your soul,
Can you feel what's goin' on? 
Yeah! right
Don't kick it I wanna freeze it,
Don't feel it I wanna drive it's the sunshine of my life,
Its the sunshine of your life can you feel it when it's right? 
Look it comes,
And when it flows like your country song what's going on
Going on
Going on
