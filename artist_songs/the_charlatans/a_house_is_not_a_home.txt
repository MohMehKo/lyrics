The simple cost of loving you is a better picture
There is not a sound coming from my voice
You want to listen to the kids - banging on
They're halos soon to be divorced
And you're a poor young factory boy blowing on your trumpet
With a home on the back of your horse

Oh!!! this is a separation
I can't believe this is the end
I don't want to talk about it
Go tell it to your friend...

I live and I breathe with feeling for anything I might have tried
At a point where I can touch her
Everyday I wonder what's going on in her heart
I couldn't eat
Sleep
Find my feet
I think I used a little too much
Force

Come see me you can heal me
Turn your head back to the moon
You know you don't have to act so quiet
This is a house not a home

I can't do this anymore I know it's pointless
(like a witch) I could never be yours,
Play to your better nature we can talk about the old days
I can't help it if you think I am odd
Although our separation it is
To easy I believe it's your loss
The simple cost of needing you is a part into the cause
On the street I can feel a sequel - this is
A divorce
