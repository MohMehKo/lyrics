What a mess in the space
You set your hair on fire again
In the rustiness of your age
Another rider up in flames
Move in on you in a most sick century
And now you know you've got to know
And now you know you just can't run
And now you know it's all to nothing and it's over
And now you know you've got to know
And now you know you just can't run
And now you know it's all to nothing and it's over
You're the girl who nicked my cage
Hangin' on with the fingernails

And I see the blind come quick then fade
Another rider up in flames
Move in on you in a most sick century
And now you know you've got to know
And now you know you just can't run
And now you know it's all to nothing and it's over
And now you know you've got to know
And now you know you just can't run
And now you know it's all to nothing and it's over
Move in on you
Move in on you
Move in on you
