Keep on listening
And you will find your beat
You'll have all that pretty ladies dancing at your feet

When will stop hurting each other
Always, somedays, never
Finders, keepers, losers, weepers

Come with me
I know perception is reality
I am my own saviour

I know you need
Don't come between us
We live our lives however we feel
We don't come apart
