By the look in your eyes i can tell all is lost and you're leaving 
So come down from your tree and join in with the circle you keep in 

I am so touched by your love 
you could lead me astray 
I could meet you down river on a lonely day 
By the look in your eye I could tell you're not mine today 

Don't pass me by 
You're looking at me like I'm from mars 
Just can't let you pass me by 
And if all the love I have could make you laugh 
And if all the tears I cried could make it better 

I've lost and it cost 
I've found the makings of a man 
I am so touched by your love 
you could lead me astray 
I could meet you down river on a lonely day 

Don't pass me by 
You're looking at me like I'm from mars 
Just can't let you pass me by 
And if all the love I have could make you laugh 
And if all the tears I cried could make it better 
And if all the things I do 
Should break your heart in two 
Then the love I'd give back to you 
Would last forever
