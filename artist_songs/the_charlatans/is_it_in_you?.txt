Is it in you
In my hunk of burning love
You're the real thing
Can't seem to get enough

Please come to set me free from these fools
Always, all day, all night
Love replied to me through you
For all the good in the world
Love returned

Please always say what's on your mind
I am on fire
At least when I am bad
My own true karma is coming back
It's alright
Am okay
At least for today
