I don't like You
But I know that
You don't like me

It's kinda funny
'cause I know You
can read me
but You need me
when I open doors
of course your thorns
become roses

My life is sure short
and your actions
are all poses

Tell me there won't be no more last days
I don't even know what They're doing backstage
You know I could really need some fun
I can feel the the cold steel from the barrel of your gun

I don't like You
and I know that
You don't like me
I don't wanna touch You
but I felt You
It was creepy

You know I don't care
That You kissed me
at the bus stop
(It felt good)
To feel your power
for a moment
kinda sordid

Tell me there won't be no more last days
I don't even know what They're doing backstage
You know I could really need some fun
I can feel the the cold steel from the barrel of your gun

Tell me there won't be no more last days
I don't even know what They're doing backstage
You know I could really need some fun
I can feel the the cold steel from the barrel of your gun

Tell me there won't be no more last days
I don't even know what They're doing backstage
You know I could really need some fun
I can feel the the cold steel from the barrel of your gun

Tell me there won't be no more last days
I don't even know what They're doing backstage
You know I could really need some fun
I can feel the the cold steel from the barrel of your gun
