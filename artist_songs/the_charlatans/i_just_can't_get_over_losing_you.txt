I just...I just...I just...Adjust
I just can't get over losing you
I just can't get over (over losing you)
I just can't get over losing you
I just can't get over (over losing you)

Look, you're a tough new book to crack
Feel the pain of a mindless shark attack
Born, to be mine
Side by side
Back to back
Feel the pain of a off-shore shark attack

Clap at the sun
Feeling divine
Get down, get down
Say hi! to the child
Clap at the sun
Look what you done
Alternate values
Restless and wild

Keep our love now baby, wherever we lie
Teach me whisperings of the blag
Deep down thoughtless feelings, high flyer
Teach me whisperings of the blag

Take my love now baby, wherever we lie
Teach me whisperings of the blag
Deep down thoughtless feelings
Hi flyer
Fly, fly, fly...
