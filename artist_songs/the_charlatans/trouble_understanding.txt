Another day keeping it familiar.
Love ya baby.
Another hour no interruption.
We need to be held to be aware of our own bodies.
Nature is trouble understanding.
Another minute and it could be a different ending.
Another second and it's gone.
Sometimes you're up for breakfast on a clear day.
Nature is trouble understanding.

We need to be held to be aware of our own bodies.
Nature is trouble understanding.
We need to be held to be aware of our own bodies.
Nature is trouble understanding.
We need to be held to be aware of our own bodies.
Nature is trouble understanding.
