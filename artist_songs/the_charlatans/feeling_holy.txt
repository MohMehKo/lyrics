Down deep I know where I wanna be, 
Long promised road, 
And an island made out of me, 
One drop can make you feel how I feel love, 
Love can make a mighty meal on the hill. 
One drop, 
Gets you feeling holy, 
Hello below me, 
One drop gets you up, 
Up and away... bad skins in bombers, 
Blue white and green. 
Chaps take a look at my hands, 
Ain't no fruit of what it can mean, 
One sweet buzz, 
Can make you feel I how I feel, 
One sweet love can make a mountain slide up the hill. 
One drop, 
Gets you feeling holy, 
Hello below me, 
One drop gets you up, 
Up and away. 
Shake it down
One drop, 
Gets you feeling holy, 
Hello below me, 
One drop
Gets you up, 
Up and away.
Feeling holy, 
Hello below me, 
Fucking feeling holy 
Feeling holy, 
Hello below me
