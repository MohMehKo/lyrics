Watching you
Learning to have every faith
In all of the things that you do
How much I've lied
Tears have been cried

Loving you
Hoping to finally nail this
All I need is your word
Lazy bones
Where are all our friends
Where are all our friends
Going down again

Watching you
Finally finding the feeling I know there's
Too much to do
Hiccups and pride
Tears I cried

A feelin' all of its own

Look at all our friends
Goin' down again
Goin' down again
I can hardly get no feelin' at all
Like a baby first starting to crawl
When I'm with you
I only want to see you smile
All I need is a satisfied mind
It's a long road

Don't cry - put your head on my shoulder
Take a long time to re-cover
I took a long time
And now I found you
Took a long time
I found you
