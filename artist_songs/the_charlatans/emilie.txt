Honesty
Is no mistake
Pretty girls
Just make waves
And together
You could say that we are a team
Living the dream

Would you call
I fell asleep
Better not
Tell them the truth
For Emilie
Lives in a made up place
She doesn't need to scape

There is no need to look for me
I am looking through you
There is no need to look for me
Emilie

Emilie
Just in case
I miss you pass
This way again
Only I know what this means to me
And how this could be

There is no need to ask for me
I am asking for you
There is no
Need ask for me
Honestly
Emilie
