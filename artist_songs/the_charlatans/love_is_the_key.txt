The kind of mind
Running wild

Oh my, my, my come on dry your eyes
There's only one kind of mind who truly satisfies 
Love is the key
I will sacrifice my soul to free you from misery

Love is the key

Your lucky creature
A lady
The kind of mind

Love is the key

Like a wandering star a hungry will get you
One kind of mind
Will truly satisfy
