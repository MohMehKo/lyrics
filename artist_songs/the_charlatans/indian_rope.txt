When we were wrong we had no right
Who am I to fade away
Sometimes i can tell you what does it mean
Who am I to question why
Who am I?

We come together
Follow the signs
Have you seen the size of mine?
You take the blame
And I'll take the pain
Who am i to sometimes say
there seems a better way

You missed a good one
Give me a break
You wish you never saw them saved
You take the fame
And I'll take the blame
Who am i to sometimes say
there seems a better way

When I was wrong we had no right
Who am I to fade away
Sometimes I can tell you what does it mean
Who am I to question why
Who am I?
