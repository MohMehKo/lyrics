There's no soldier in me.
Although I try to believe that
All is not in always what you see.
Army featherweights are bully boys without home
I recognise the mastermind device
The end of everything 
You're dead in me forever.

No education I want besides the one that I've got 
Divorce me from the zeros what do they know.
20th century cultureless stereotypes waving words worth nothing to me
Now the end of everything 
You're dead in me forever
They only want a "yes-man"

They will tell you what to believe and no 

Yes I do 
I only want to be strong
There is no soldier in me
I want my guts where they are not dumb to these false leaders anymore
And now you want to achieve another worthless defeat.
Welcome here the heroes
They're on their way home the end of everything 
You're dead in me forever
They only want a "yes-man"
They tell you what to believe and no 
Yes I do I only want to be strong
