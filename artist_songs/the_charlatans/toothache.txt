I bet'cha them bullets can surely blow, 
Me back to hell all down we go, 
Lick your belly and I make you smile I hear ya, 
I'm achin' I'm milking the miles, 
Honey I don't mind. 
Your trickin' me right? 
I'm a tramp and I love you, 
Hold me down,
Hold me down mesmerisin' me, 
All the world can see, 
I can sing oh! 
Yeah I'm drivin' in the back seat of your love.
Shooting stars don't make you see, 
Your living on love I can feel its real, 
Kiss your belly and I make a smile, 
I hear ya, I'm achin', 
I'm milkin' the miles, 
No milk don't melt in the back of my mouth, 
I'm a tramp and I love you, 
Hold me down, hold me down
No milk in the back of my mouth 
No milk in the back of my mouth 
No milk in the back of my mouth
Mesmerisin' me all the world can see, 
I can sing oh yeah, don't need no bore - a - tellin' - me you
Can have it all 
Can have it all 
Can have it all
I'm driving in the back seat of you love.
