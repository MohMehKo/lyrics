Don't give me that disease,
I can't find my way out
The rush for the pleasure deservedly honoured,
There's no place for the sinner in your hole
Why me?
Why me?
There's nobody after your blood in this country
You're absolutely streets ahead of me

If you happen to die I wont be there
If you happen to leave then in order to remain there
Would you do the same on me?

Why me?
Why me?
There's nobody's interest in waiting for no-one
With all the friends I've lost I should have known

If you happen to die I wont be there
If you happen to leave then in order to remain there
Would you do the same on me?

Touched by
Touched by

If you happen to die I wont be there
If you happen to leave then in order to remain there
Would you do the same on me?
If you happen to die I wont be there
If you happen to leave then in order to remain there
Would you?

Do the same on me

If you happen to die I wont be there
If you happen to leave then in order to remain there
Would you do the same on me?
