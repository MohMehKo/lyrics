Sometimes you cry, 
Cry sometimes. 
What you gonna do when the bullet comes round, 
What gonna do when the seas are down, 
Lickin' like a lion, 
With a big cat heart, 
Checkin' in the dark being quick bein' smart, 
Live it like you love it, 
Do it lets go, 
Blowin' with the giant, 
Fe fi fo. 
Stuck on the way you walk, 
Hooked on the way you talk, 
Stuck on the way you walk, 
Hooked on the way you talk. 
Tell me its the way you feel, 
And not the place you hold your dreams baby, 
It's not where you are. 
Tell me its the way you feel, 
And not the place you hold your dreams baby, 
It's not where you are. 
One day we'll fly, 
Fly from the wack o' ma mind, 
Hope you're here to stay, 
To see the bullets come round, 
People 'working out' with their sun hats on. 
Kiss me like a tiger, 
With a big cat heart, 
I'll read it if you buy it, 
Feelin' quick bein' smart, 
Lookin' at the devil, 
Blowin' with the giant, 
Fe fi fo. 
Live it like you love it
Live it like you love it 
Live it like you love it
