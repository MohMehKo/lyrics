Lookin in through the back room window
Just to see what's happening here
See the sparks fly, I know, in your glory
I get opinions I get the stories

Lookin out from the back room window
Just to see where I go and I will go
I wish you could see
You never could be happy without me

Freeze in a nodulant county
All the walls come tumbling down
See the past and the future behind me
I could find the sweet drum and swallow the round

Waking up as that melody calls me
I can fly down oceans easy
I can wait
Swim anywhere to be where love grows

She's drawing all the spikes from me
I've never felt so clean
She's drawing all the spikes from me
I've never felt so clean

Drivin south through the park it belies eye spy
In the division on the east side of town
Feel the life and feel the pulse and arouse me
All the walls come tumbling down

Lookin out from the back room window
Just to see where you go and I will go
I wish you could see
You never could be happy without me

She's drawing all the spikes from me
I've never felt so clean
She's drawing all the spikes from me
I've never felt so clean

She's tearing all the spikes from me
I've never felt so clean
