Coming up and you black out on me
Coming up and you black out on me
Moving into the light now you don't exist

Coming outta the bad times, baby
Coming outta the bad times, baby
Moving into the light
You gotta see me land on the sun

Coming outta the rain, baby
Coming outta the rain, baby
Guess you was on the street
And you blew my day

Coming up and you black out on me
Coming up and you black out on me
Seen it coming for years
And you're this a way

A [?] out over that [?]
And there's enough in the blues

Through the last town
Through the week
I kissed you once on a sunny street
I want to get to know you inside out now
I want to get to know you inside out now

A [?] out over that [?]
And there's enough in the blues

This is a new day
This is the faith
I'll be the founder
And you'll be the way
[Repeat: x3]

Ooh...
Break it down...
