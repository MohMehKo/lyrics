The sick and complicated eyes are mine
To find a way inside the hold you
Break the one you break
You should have done inside
Leave me alone
I can't take forever I know 
Leave me alone
I can't take forever I know
The sick and complicated eyes are mine

To find a way inside watch out
You're going to burn yourself
You hate yourself which way inside
Leave me alone I can't take forever
I know leave me alone
I can't take forever
I know happiness is hard
When I am stretched out ahead
On the floor that's what I readÂ­
