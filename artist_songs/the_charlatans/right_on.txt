We live inside a dream - a certain bliss
Tonight I saw a shooting star
Thought of this

You're playing out the past - You can't live without
Turning all your good ideas into doubt
I know you're blind you can't seem to understand
The way in which the purest form is in my hand 
You call, call it ain't right,I won't have this 
You're singin' all your World War songs, go buy a kiss

Right on right on through the darkness, there is a hope
Right on right on through the darkness, there is pure vision 

I am blind and I can't seem to understand 
But tonight I had the clearest thought I have ever had 
I am sitting on a spoon, I shed a tear
No Lord above can save my home from the fear 
Keep it, keep it on, keep it clear 
No Lord above can save your soul from the fear
Right on right on, my pride is my own
Go give your last piece of pie to the chicken run 

Right on right on through the darkness, there is a hope
Right on right on through the darkness, there is pure vision 

I had a talk with a little little thing
The purest Chinese ancient face came sailin' in 
He said boy you ain't no good
Your present scene, you curl up and you crawl right back to the dream

Right on right on through the darkness, there is a hope
Right on right on through the darkness, there is pure vision 

Right on through the darkness, right on through the night, 
Right on through the evil, right on through the night
