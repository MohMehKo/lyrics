Another happy lad with dirty pictures plastered on the wall.
A British beach collection a classic alcoholic argument.
I don't want to see the sights there is nothing worse,
Thank God I don't have to see the sights.

This bloody city,
I don't want to waste another year.
Likenising ozone(s) are falling from the sky in front of me.

I don't want to see the sights there is nothing worse,

Thank God I told you not to see the sights.
So, this is life,
You don't seem like history to me.

Tell me I don't know.
Are the bruises on your face stick-on-ones
Why don't I find out what you want there is never
A place I have been through,
You're going to wind up with every sod and stall,
They are going to wind up with you and you, and you...
