One thing on my mind, 
I think I'll take a little walk in the wild, 
The feelings come and roll, 
Put it in your pocket and I'll save it for another day, 
Hey hey hey. 
Life becomes my shield, 
And she becomes my life, 
Not afraid of too much livin', 
I'm waitin' for the day I wanna live it wanna live it with a kiss.
One hundred planes with bombs, 
Couldn't turn your headlights on, 
No fiction roping you down I know and feel what's going on, 
There's a sad man on my mind, 
I think I'll take a little walk outside, 
But the feelings never go, 
I'm waiting for the day I wanna live it, 
I wanna live it how I see.
