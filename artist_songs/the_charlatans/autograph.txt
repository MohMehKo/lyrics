Movin' in with the scum
And shine a light on the sweet one
Makes the one with the soul,classic girl
Can I have your autograph it's not for what you are
It's for only what you're not
This is not a place, it's a feeling now
Burning up in the sun in the fields

Next to this on a wall, it means everything
Change the world at seventeen what a way to get it right and now she's gotta go
Call it everything you hate and call me something more, call me what you want
Can't stop this feeling now
Get it over the floor didn't feel it
Get it out of the hole, didn't fill me in?
