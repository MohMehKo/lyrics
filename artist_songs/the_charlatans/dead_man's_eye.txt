The war was won, the battle over ran
The fire in the girl in the far east sun
The rhythm was swift, the boys they were alive
There will always be a clue in a dead man's eye

Way out west on any avenue
We always find the girls in the high heel shoes
The boys were shot, my father was a liar
There will always be a clue in a dead man's eye

The winds were heavy and the boys were shot
The river was red, all the lives we lost
The devil encounters makes you feel damned
To be alive

The war was won, the battle over ran
The fire in the girls in the far east sun
The rhythm was hot, my father was alive
Always be a clue in a dead man's eye

The spirit was broken but the girls were hot
The river was red, all the lives we lost
The devil encounters makes you feel damned
To be alive
