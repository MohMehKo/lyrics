It's a day for letting go,
You've lost all the control,
Burn a bridge, call me a bitch,
Start tearing up each others clothes.

To the only world who'd know,
It's a day for letting go,
Elevate me, eventually now,
Heads are gonna roll.

I want you to be happy,
So fair and brother we and evidently,
Everything depends upon the drug.

I bit into a wall,
You could have given more,
With repartition,
It begs the question which side are you on?

The feeling never goes,
You suffocate my soul,
Revenge is sweeter,
Bitterness will seep into our little bones.

I want you to be happy,
So fair and brother we and evidently,
Everything depends upon the drug.

You wouldn't want to be with me alone,
With the suggs,
When you reach out, and you sleep as a youth,
Oh, you wouldn't wanna get me on the rack,
This is the sound, of the crowd, and our dreams burning down.

Inoculate my soul,
Who's side are you on,
Evidently everything depends upon the drug.

Wo-ho-wo-ho-wo-ho,
Who's side are you on?

Begs the question who's side are you on?
