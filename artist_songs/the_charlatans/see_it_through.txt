Carry me away from the country, 
Ride a number 24 to the west, 
Feel the earth begin to move on the music, 
Singin' anthems I'll be down anywheres, 
I wanna free all the monkeys, 
Don't wanna live in the zoo, 
It's gettin' better, 
One day its gonna happen and we'll see it through...
Back upon the hillside our love smiles 
And I see you won a cheap holiday, 
And I feel I find it hard to deny it I'll be there, 
I'll be there, 
I wanna free all the monkeys, 
Don't wanna live in the zoo, 
It's getting better, 
One day its gonna happen and we'll see it through, 
Right now baby the world won't ever change me and you. 
I wanna be with this country, 
I can't I've seen all there is, 
It's getting better, 
One day it's gonna happen and we'll see it through, 
Get us through, 
See us through, 
Right now baby the world won't ever change me and you.
