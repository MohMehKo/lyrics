I never liked the fact
And I don't like to moan
I thought we had a pact
Talking in tones
I don't know how to act
When you pick up the phone

I'll start filling in the gaps
Talking in tones, talking in tones

Ooh I fell strengthened
By your presence
Ooh its like heaven
In six's and seven's

I never liked the fact
And I don't like to moan
Just keeping us on track
Talking in tones, talking in tones

Ooh I fell strengthened
By your presence
Ooh its like heaven
In six's and seven's

Ooh-ooh I fell strengthened
By your presence
Its like heaven
Its like heaven
Its like heaven
