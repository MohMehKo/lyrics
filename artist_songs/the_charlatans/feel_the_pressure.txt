Used to tell me everything
Never had to be so shy about it
Now you're keeping secrets babe
How could you act so mean?

Am I old enough
Am I young enough
Am I tough enough
Am I lean enough
To feel the pressure, feel the pressure, feel the pressure, feel the pressure

I guess you called me everything
Every name in the book
But remember who's the king
Who could have thought you could act so mean?
You can look at me
And see all the cracks,
All of my failings, all the guts that I lack
Let me see you smile ya know
I'm all you got

Am I old enough
Am I young enough
Am I tough enough
Am I lean enough
To feel the pressure, feel the pressure, feel the pressure, feel the pressure

Who is the girl in the tight black dress?
Pressing all your buttons, pretending she's an heiress
Now she's leaving town with someone else
I guess I'll get some rest

Am I old enough
Am I young enough
Am I tough enough
Am I lean enough
To feel the pressure, feel the pressure, feel the pressure, feel the pressure

Am I old enough
Am I young enough
Am I tough enough, 
Am I lean enough to feel the pressure, 
Feel the pressure, 
Feel the pressure, 
Feel the pressure
