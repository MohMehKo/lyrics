Lord
It's been a long time
And people don't you find
Always leave their troubles at your door
I live on my own
I don't need a bitter soul beatin' on about my country anymore
Don't you think your daddy needs you home right away

O - it's about time, can't you for once be strong
I bleed a little to
You're invisible, is there something I can give to you
I see my light come shining
There is good on the horizon
Daylight sneaking through my window
I will give you a rainbow and a bucket full of gold
You been bitten by eleven hungry kittens
Who will go the whole distance while the blind stagger

O - let the light shine, could you for once be strong
I bleed a little too
You're invisible, is there something I can give to you
I see my light come shining
There is good on the horizon
Daylight sneaking through my window
I will give you a rainbow and a bucket full of gold
You been bitten by eleven hungry kittens
Who will go the whole distance while the blind stagger
