I'll sing a hymn
To praise you all
I found the lord
And he came to my home
I'll paint the ladder
I sail the breeze
I am so very different to all of these

You came to me,
And I took you in,
I've been in trouble ever since back then
I've been a bum
I've been a few
But I don't wanna leave this world without you

You play the black and the red turns up
You can't get all your answers from your favourite cup
Life is a moment
An apple thats bruised
I'm giving up more than my heart can lose

You came to me when I needed you the most
We all like to cover up our wounds with salt
I've been a bum
I've been a few
But I don't wanna leave this world without you

I found my love five years ago

You came to me and you found my soul
You came to me, my only friend
You took care of my suitcase then

You came to me,
And I took you in,
I've been trying to finish before I begin
I've been a bum
I've been a few
But I don't want to live in this world without you
