There's two of us who know and love each other
Trying to make it something special
There's two of us living it as one
I get fazed but it's only natural

When it's over it's last
I don't mean good as in bad should be my sister
How come I feel you
I can't even see you

Wonder where my sweet is at
Your eyes are smiling back
There's no bitterness
It's obvious the future's in

There's two we live inside each other
Waitin' for a substition
Two of us who need a separation
Be the bear, I'll be the golden eagle

When you future's your past and you put it in words
You're like no other
How come I feel you
I can't ever see ya

Wonder where my sweet is at
Your eyes are smiling back
There's no bitterness
It's obvious the future's in our hearts

They're cutting heads I know we can make it
I know you've got the front you can fake it
All I wanna be is a dealer and get your high
I've got mine, I've got mine, I've got mine

There's two of us outgrowin' one another
Lookin' for a substitute, yeah
There's two of us who need a separation
You be the queen I'll be the golden eagle

When it's over it's last
I don't mean good as in bad you're like no other
How come I need you
I wanna go where the sun goes, yeah

Wonder where my sweet is at
And your lies are smiling back
There's no bitterness
It's obvious the future's in our hearts
