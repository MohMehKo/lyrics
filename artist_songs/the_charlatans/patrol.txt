I wanna patrol your innocent mind
It's only a dream
It'd be just like the old days
I know and I feel in the value of sound
How can we still
Tear each other's hearts out
You mess up my mind
Mess up my mind
Mess up my mind
You mess up my mind
Sun comes up
Sun goes down
On our way
To get back home and see you today
I wanna be over this anonymous phase
Or is it because
I feel like being hounded
Sell me a reason I'll sell you a sound
I guess in a way
I've ended what you've started
You mess up my mind

Mess up my mind
Mess up my mind
You mess up my mind
Sun comes up
Sun goes down
On our way
To get back home and see you today
Kick your kill, save us by
Someone's gotta
Take you down the line
I know what I'm feelin' the language of sound
How can we still
Tear each other's hearts out
You mess up my mind
Mess up my mind
Mess up my mind
You mess up my mind
You mess up my mind
You mess up my mind
You mess up my mind
You mess up my mind
