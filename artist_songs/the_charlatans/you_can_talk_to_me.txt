You can go anyhow
I'm not too young to know
I can talk anyway
Who cares what they say
I don't know what
What all the fuss is all about

I know you as I do
And you mean what you say
You can go anytime
It might pass us by

I don't know what
I don't know what
What all the fuss is all about
You can you can talk to me
You can you can talk to me

Keep the butchers away
There's no sweat today
I can listen to all
That bothers you now

I don't know what
I don't know what
What all the fuss is all about
You can you can talk to me
You can you can talk to me

You can go anyhow
I'm not too young to know
I suppose you're alright
Who cares for you now

I don't know what
What all the fuss is all about
You can you can talk to me
You can you can talk to me

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk
You can talk
You can talk
You can talk
You can talk to me

You can you can talk to me
