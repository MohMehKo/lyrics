When You were young
You were
The first to crash
And burn
That's an illusion for the world to see

Now We don't look
The same
Maybe it's D.
N.a.
I can't change You and You You can't change me

Missing Beats of a generation
Through disappointments and self frustrations

Missing Beats of a generation
Through disappointments and self frustrations

When You were just
Sixteen
You were the one
For me
I can't recall us getting too much sleep

Now We are not
The same
Maybe it's D.
N.a.
I can't change You and You You can't change me

Missing Beats of a generation
Through disappointments and self frustrations

Missing Beats of a generation
The nature of our expectations

When You were young
You were
The first to crash
And burn
That's an illusion for the world to see

Missing Beats of a generation
Through disappointments and self frustrations

Missing Beats of a generation
The nature of our expectations

Missing Beats of a generation
Through disappointments and self frustrations

Missing Beats of a generation
The nature of our expectations

On and on, and on, and on,
The more We know the less We glow
I never thought
You would look so old

On and on, and on, and on,
The more We know the less You go
I never thought
You would look so old
