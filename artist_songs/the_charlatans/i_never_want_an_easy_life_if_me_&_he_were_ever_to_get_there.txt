Oh my life it's started again
You can't know we're ever the same
I feel it, I just can't get the scene to fit
Save me, I don't wanna stick with the sights
Shoot it up and go for a ride

I fly, she drives over the wall
Kick out all those humans and all
I want it, I just can't seem to get to it
TV culture it's only a crime,
An overdose, it's a part of a good time
