Don't ask me to socialise
A third degree has blown my eyes
Express a feeling captured once
The one I want surprised me once

A citrus state to be in one
And one is like a god in lime
A black inside I know too well, to wear my
Worth and buy the grind

And not to waste this scene on it's not my
Independence that I'm afraid of this time
And not to base this scene on it's not my
Independence I'm ashamed of

And one dissolved in sea again
A third degree has blown my eyes and in
The end your end is clean a conscious state
To call my own

I don't remember the way you used to be

And not to waste this scene on it's not my
Independence that I'm afraid of this time
And not to base this scene on it's not my
Independence I'm ashamed of

Don't ask me to socialise
The world has blown the love outside
And I can't tell if you are wrong
The one who turns to me alone

And not to waste this scene on it's not my
Independence that I'm afraid of this time
And not to base this scene on it's not my
Independence I'm ashamed of

I don't remember the way you used to be
