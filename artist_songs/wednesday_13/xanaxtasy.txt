It's a long way to the top of the medicine cabinet
I'm taking funny pills from the white coat rabbit
They tell me I'm fine and away they send me
I'm out of my mind by 11:30

Hey, hey, hey
Make it all go away
Hey, hey, hey
Watch it all fade away

I want you to make me feel like I'm not even myself

Am I insane?
Or am I just crazy?
Am I schizophrenic?
Or does it make a difference tonight?
Have I lost my mind?
'Cause I don't feel like me
I've found my home away from home
Xanaxtasy

I want you to make me feel like I'm not even myself

Disarray every single day
What used to be important has been replaced
And I never knew delusion even had a taste
And I fall in love when I see her face

Hey, hey, hey
Make it all go away
Hey, hey, hey
Watch it all fade away

I want you to make me feel like I'm not even myself

Am I insane?
Or am I just crazy?
Am I schizophrenic?
Or does it make a difference tonight?
Have I lost my mind?
'Cause I don't feel like me
I've found my home away from home
Xanaxtasy

I want you to make me feel like I'm not even myself

Am I insane?
Or am I just crazy?
Am I schizophrenic?
Or does it make a difference tonight?
Have I lost my mind?
'Cause I don't feel like me
I've found my home away from home
Xanaxtasy
