Some people they were born with it
They got the flame burning in thier eyes
Shoot first and ask questions later has been the story of my life

Two middle fingers and a mouth from the south
And my targets in my site
I hold a candle for the devil baby cause it keeps me warm at night

(Hold a candle for the Devil)
He leads me home at night
(Hold a candle for the Devil)
He always treats me right

Some people say it makes no sense
It's like I'm itching for an early grave
Just like my mamma always told me I'm the only hell she ever raised

Full throttle down this high way to hell
Buckle up now it's a bumpy ride
666 grab your crucifix it's gunna be a hell of a night

(Hold a candle for the Devil)
He leads me home at night
(Hold a candle for the Devil)
He always treats me right
