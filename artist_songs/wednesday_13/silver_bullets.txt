I'm starting to feel strange, something's coming over me
I was bitten the other night from what I could not see

[Chorus]
It's getting closer, I start to sweat
Please don't forget the silver bullets
I'm turning into something, baby don't be scared
I promise not to hurt you
But baby please come prepared
With silver bullets

I know darling it's such a horrible sight 
Apart this violent night
Be aware of the moon full of the werewolves
But I promised I won't hurt you

[Chorus]
It's getting closer, I start to sweat
Please don't forget the silver bullets
I'm turning into something, baby don't be scared
I promise not to hurt you
But baby please come prepared
With silver bullets
[X2]

With silver bullets
With silver bullets
