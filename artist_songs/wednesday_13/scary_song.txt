There's something underneath your bed,
Pull the sheets up over your head.
You hear something, what was that? Boo
Afraid of things that go bump in the night.
The candle in the pumpkin is the only light,
So get ready for the fright of your life, yeah.

Baby let me sing you a scary song
Put on your halloween mask and sing along
It's the creature feature baby from dust 'till dawn.
Baby let me sing you a scary song.

He walks tall and carries a butcher knife
The boogie man a only wants to take your life.
You kill him off, he'll just come right back, in part 2

Baby let me sing you a scary song
Put on your halloween mask and sing along
It's the creature feature baby from dust 'till dawn.
Baby let me sing you a scary song.

Baby let me sing you a scary song
Put on your halloween mask and sing along
It's the creature feature baby from dust 'till dawn.
Baby let me sing you a scary song.
