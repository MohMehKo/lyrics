We're gonna kill you

Every year on Halloween
That's the time when we get mean
Are you ready for the horror show?
And now we're sharpening up the knives
And off we go to take your lives
Are you ready for the horror show?

Trick or treat, trick or treat
Give us something good to eat
And if you don't, we don't care
We'll cut off your fucking head

We're gonna kill you (Oi! Oi!)
We're gonna kill you (Oi! Oi!)
We're gonna kill you (Oi! Oi!)
That's what we do
We're gonna kill you, wow

And when you open up the door
And you'll be lying on the floor
Are you ready for the horror show?
Don't try to fight it, no one cared
That I'm the fucking boogeyman
Are you ready for the horror show?

Trick or treat, trick or treat
Give us something good to eat
And if you don't, we don't care
We'll cut off your fucking head

We're gonna kill you (Oi! Oi!)
We're gonna kill you (Oi! Oi!)
We're gonna kill you (Oi! Oi!)
That's what we do
We're gonna kill you, wow

Trick or treat, trick or treat
Give us something good to eat
And if you don't, we don't care
We'll cut off your fucking head

We're gonna kill you (Oi! Oi!)
We're gonna kill you (Oi! Oi!)
We're gonna kill you (Oi! Oi!)
That's what we do
We're gonna kill you

We're gonna kill you (Oi! Oi!)
We're gonna kill you (Oi! Oi!)
We're gonna kill you (Oi! Oi!)
That's what we do
We're gonna kill you, wow

We're gonna kill you
