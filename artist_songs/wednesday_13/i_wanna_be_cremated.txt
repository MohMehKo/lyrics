Burn the flames until I'm ash and grey
And store my remains, inside of you some day
Hand in hand in now were can to can
Ashes to ashes
With a fool proof funeral plan

I guess I'll never know I was born to crash and burn out baby
Yeah I'm hot around the car and I realized I just need a bottle to fry me
Like KFC

I wanna be cremated
(I wanna be cremated)
I wanna be cremated
(I wanna be cremated)
[x2]

All that remains of this cold black tray
Throw whats left of me inside this tin grave
Hand in hand in now were can to can
Ashes to ashes
With a fool proof funeral plan

I guess I'll never know I was born to crash and burn out baby
Yeah I'm hot around the car and I realized I just need a bottle to fry me
Like KFC

I wanna be cremated
(I wanna be cremated)
I wanna be cremated
(I wanna be cremated)
