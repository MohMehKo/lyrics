Just kiss your ass goodbye
They're falling from the skies
And you can hear 'em screaming redrum, redrum
And all your faith and hope
It's been a fucking joke
Now who will be screaming oh my god, oh my god?

Another solar system controls the earth like a prison
Total extinction of the human race is their prime mission

Now they're trying to keep
Us all asleep
Now we're all dead
Now they're here and ready to creep

You're going to get what you deserve
Monsters of the universe
There's no escape, death is assured
Monsters of the universe
There is no faith, there is no cure
Monsters of the universe
It's pure intergalactic war

Their hands around your throat
And as you gasp and choke
You're gagging pleading screaming oh my god, oh my god
And he can't save you darling
And that's the fucking problem
Because your puny god never was, never was

Another solar system controls the earth like a prison
Total extinction of the human race is their prime mission

Now they're trying to keep
Us all asleep
Now we're all dead
Now they're here and ready to creep

You're going to get what you deserve
Monsters of the universe
There's no escape, death is assured
Monsters of the universe
There is no faith, there is no cure
Monsters of the universe
It's pure intergalactic war

Now is the time
For you to die
Your final breath is what we'll take from you tonight
There is no cure
From this curse
We are the monsters of the universe
