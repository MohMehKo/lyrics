Saw you on the slab
Late saturday night
Took one look at you
Couldnt believe my eyes
And babe no doubt about it
I'm crazy about you

Love that care
And I peel my skin
Even though your due away
It's my perfect chance
And babe no doubt about it
I'm crazy about you

Ghoul in blue
I'll ride with you
Miss Morgue
I Adore you
[x2]

Ohh Miss Morgue

You don't have really much to say
As a matter of fact you don't say a thing
And babe no doubt about it
I'm crazy about you

It's not so bad once you get past the smell
But I've never been one to kiss and tell
And babe no doubt about it
I'm crazy about you

Ghoul in blue
I'll ride with you
Miss Morgue
I Adore you
[x4]

Ohh Miss Morgue
[x4]
