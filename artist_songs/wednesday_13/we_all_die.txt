Do ya think we'll be alright? It's hard to say 
Will we get out of here alive? No not today 
We're all running for our lives, will we be saved? 
There's only one ticket out, above and away.

So many things I wanna say to you 
Sorry for the things that I know I put you through 
No matter what you always put a smile upon my face 
Just know that I love you more than anything, just incase. 
We all die 
Woah, We all die. 
Woah, We all die. 
Woah, We all die. 
I can't believe my eyes, What's happening? 
Will I even get to say goodbye? It's hard to say 
We're all running for our lives, will we be saved? 
There's only one ticket out, above and away.

So many things I wanna say to you 
Sorry for the things that I know I put you through 
No matter what you always put a smile upon my face 
Just know that I love you more than anything, just incase. 
We all die 
Woah, We all die. 
Woah, We all die. 
Woah, We all die. 

So many things I wanna say to you 
Sorry for the things that I know I put you through 
No matter what you always put a smile upon my face 
Just know that I love you more than anything, just incase. 
We all die 
Woah, We all die. 
Woah, We all die.
