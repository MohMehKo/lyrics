I've made my mind up, your blood I wanna suck,
Just tap the vein, give into me!
The sun, now has set, don't make me beg for it,
Just tap the vein, give into me!

We're the things that go bump in the night,
Go ahead and scream baby...
Scream for your life!

You've got blood and we want it,
You've got blood and we need it,
You've got blood and we'll drink it,
I'm a bloodsucker, motherfucker!

You've got blood and we want it,
You've got blood and we need it,
You've got blood and we'll drink it,
I'm a bloodsucker, motherfucker!

The darkness has arrived, and now we say goodbye,
Just tap the vein, give into me!
And now I lick my lips, your death I can't resist,
Just tap the vein, give into me!

If you've got the blood, then I've got the time,
And if you don't motherfucker! 
Don't waste my time!

You've got blood and we want it,
You've got blood and we need it,
You've got blood and we'll drink it,
I'm a bloodsucker, motherfucker!

You've got blood and we want it,
You've got blood and we need it,
You've got blood and we'll drink it,
I'm a bloodsucker, motherfucker!
