New york city, N.Y.C.
Pretty mean when it wants to be
Black leather, knee-hole pants
Can't play no high school dance

Fuzz tone, hear 'em go
Hear 'em on the radio
Misfits, twilight zone
R-A-M-O-N-E-S, R-A-M-O-N-E-S
Ramones

Bad boy rock, bad boy roll
Gabba gabba, see them go
C. Jay now hit the gas
Watch Marky kick some ass

Go Johnny, go, go, go, go
Tommy o-way-o
Misfits, twilight zone
R-A-M-O-N-E-S, R-A-M-O-N-E-S
Ramones

Bad boys then, bad boys now
Good buddies, mau, mau, mau
Keep it up, rock 'n' roll
Good music save your soul

Dee Dee, he left home
Joey call me on the phone
Misfits, twilight zone
R-A-M-O-N-E-S, R-A-M-O-N-E-S
Ramones
