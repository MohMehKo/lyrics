Zombie, cadaver, what does it matter?
I’m a spook, a creep, the recently deceased
And I’m a creature, a curse, the body in the hearse
And I’m screaming bloody murder from the very first verse

And I’m your death, your dealer, your faithful deceiver
I got maggots on the brain but I can’t complain
I got a spot in the cemetery,
Baby, that’s calling your name

Get your grave, get your grave on, baby
Start rotting away
I’m dying just to hear you say
Life’s a grave, now dig it, baby
[x2]

Monster, a fiend, the body at the scene
Take your wrist, a razor, do yourself a favor
I’m your ghoul, your host, the ghost that wants the most
Now lick your lips, bitch, here’s another fucking dose

And I love blood, guts and all that violent stuff
I like guns, knives, taking people’s lives
Got all the creatures in the casket screaming
Baby, won’t you come inside

Get your grave, get your grave on, baby
Start rotting away
I’m dying just to hear you say
Life’s a grave, now dig it, baby
[x2]

Baby
Baby

Get your grave, get your grave on, baby
Start rotting away
I’m dying just to hear you say
Life’s a grave, now dig it, baby
[x2]
