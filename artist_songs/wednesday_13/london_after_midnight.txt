My make-up's smeared, and I'm looking for a fight,
And I'm OUT IN LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT!

I wanna get loaded, I wanna break some stuff,
I'm going down to the pub and see who thinks they're tough
I'm looking for action, I'm looking for trouble,
I'm drinking triples now, cause I'm seeing double

EVERY DRINK,
I CARE LESS OF WHAT YOU THINK, OF ME,
AND I'LL BE DAMNED IF I'LL GO DOWN WITHOUT THE WORLD KNOWING MY NAME!

My make-up's smeared, and I'm looking for a fight,
And I'm OUT IN LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT! [x2]

I'm an N.C. Doll, out looking for a kiss,
Then ten drinks later I can barely stand I'm so pissed,
As the sun comes up, and I crawl to my bunk,
My head is spinning bad cause I'm so fucked up

EVERY DRINK,
I CARE LESS OF WHAT YOU THINK, OF ME,
AND I'LL BE DAMNED IF I'LL GO DOWN WITHOUT THE WORLD KNOWING MY NAME!

My make-up's smeared, and I'm looking for a fight,
And I'm OUT IN LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT! [x2]

EVERY DRINK,
I CARE LESS OF WHAT YOU THINK, OF ME,
AND I'LL BE DAMNED IF I'LL GO DOWN WITHOUT THE WORLD KNOWING MY NAME!

My make-up's smeared, and I'm looking for a fight,
And I'm OUT IN LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT! [x3]
