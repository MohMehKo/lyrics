I can't believe you're here with me
I growing a custom to your screams
As I dismember it's a night to remember
Woah one knife stand
One knife stand
One knife stand
You're blood is oh so warm and red
I watch it drip down from your head
As I dismember it's a night to remember
Woah one knife stand
One knife stand
One knife stand
As I dismember it's a night to remeber
Woah one knife stand
One knife stand
One knife stand
Woah one knife stand
One knife stand
One knife stand
