Shes probably from the casket
I really wanna ask her
If shell be my one and only
Im tired of being lonley
I know this sounds sick
I gotta bite you on the neck
And make you mine

You couldnt get me higher
My little vampire
Your beautiful and spooky
You dont mind that Im kooky
I wanna drive a steak
Right into your heart
And make you mine
(All mine)

I fell in love with
The ghoul of my dreams
Shes the only one that makes me scream
[x2]

Shell be my little spider
Ill sit right beside her
She doesnt think its scarry
And then Im usually burried
I know this sounds sick
I gotta bite you on the neck
And make you mine

And when your next to me
I dont need no Halloween
Cause you can make me scream
Like no other human being
Now I wanna drive a steak
Right into your heart
And make you mine
(All mine)

I fell in love with
The ghoul of my dreams
Shes the only one that makes me scream
[x2]
