Gonna take you where the moon don't shine
Way back beyond the pines
Tell you a story of the very worst kind, yeah

Here we go!

They said they were invincible
So indestructible
The most horrific thing you've seen, yeah

Now lordy, lordy, make your bed
Beware the Dixie dead
Dixie dead

Now lordy, lordy, make your bed
Beware the Dixie dead
Dixie dead

He-yeaw!

Some say they stomp around the swamp
And blood is all they want
Just call it Hillbilly homicide, yeah

And they say when the moon is full
Those motherfucking ghouls
Are ready to bleed you dry, yeah

Now lordy, lordy, make your bed
Beware the Dixie dead
Dixie dead

Now lordy, lordy, make your bed
Beware the Dixie dead
Dixie dead

Now lordy, lordy, make your bed
Beware the Dixie dead
Dixie dead

Now lordy, lordy, make your bed
Beware the Dixie dead
Dixie dead
