[Chorus]
Can we try to work it out
There's no need to scream and shout
Lets take this love and turn it around
Cuz we got issues

[Verse 1:]
You can tell me that you love me
And make it sound so sweet
Then turn right around and cuss me
Right in the middle of the street
Now I can do my usual thing
Jump in my car and speed away
But u know I come running back
To you the very next day
Can we try to work it out

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 2:]
Everybody got some problems
That don't make them have doubts
Before the neighbors call the cops on us
Lets try and straightin' this thing out
If they knew you were gonna do some many things
Then it's just not meant to be
I just want you to be happy baby
I just want you to be with me

[Chorus: x2]

[Bridge:]
When you put out something
You get back something
You put out nothing
You get the same
Cuz everyday were struggling
Tryna keep this love from falling down
And no one was the blame

Just a lil mo time just a little
Just a lil more tries just a little
Just a lil love just a little
Cuz we got issues

[Chorus: till end]
