Oooooh yea
Yea yea yeaaaa
Oh oh oh ohh
Beauty can get em
But it sure can't keep em

[Verse 1:]
You can have the prettiest skin
Prettiest eyes
Prettiest smile with the thickest thighs
And a sex apply but that don't mean a thing to me
Cause without honesty or loyalty
You can only be a common enemy

[Chorus:]
That's why
Beauty can get em
But sure can't keep em
(beauty can get em but it sure can't keep em)
Beauty can get em
But it sure can't keep em
It's a plus but it don't mean nothin tho

[Verse 2:]
Without a good heart
What good are you to me
Only impressed
By the things you see
SUV's with TV's, expensive clothes and accesories
If it looks good to you
Don't mean that it's good for you
All you need is real love
Nowadays it's hard to find

[Chorus:]
Beauty can get em
But it sure can't keep em
(see my mama told me the came exact words)
Beauty can get em
But it sure can't keep em

[Hook:]
Ooooh will you
Will you stay by me girl
If I lost all my money
Will you
Be there even when things go down
Oooh yea yea yea

[Chorus:]
Beauty can get em
But it sure can't keep em
If I need somebody? I'll just open up a magazine
Beauty can get em
But it sure can't keep em
What's the use of lookin at ya
When you can't do nuttin for me
Beauty can get em
But it sure can't keep em
(sure can't keep em)
Beauty can get em
But it sure can't keep em
(sure can't keep)

[Talking:]
(yea wooaaahh)
You can be the most
Finest thing on the outside
But the ugliest in the inside
Feel me? aight
(beauty) see to you (can get em)
