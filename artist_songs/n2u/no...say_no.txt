Look I need to talk to you
Tell you what I'm bout to do
And I need you help to stop me
Cause I got a girl at home that loves me

Boy I got myself in a tight situtation
About 5'5 long hair with brown eyes
And without girl I can't excape it
Oh ain't no use in trying
So come on out
Come on out
I know you're in there
I need you now
Cause I'm about to lose it all
And you're the only one I can call on
Know if you hear me I need you
Know if you are listening I'm in trobule
Know if you're there I've falling
And I can't get up
So hurry up
And just say no (no, no, no)
No say no

Now I'm in the hotel elevator
On my way up to her room
Were she waiting on me to lay it down
And do whatever as long as I make it feel good (good, good)

Boy I got myself in a tight situtation
About 5'5 long hair with brown eyes
And without girl I can't excape it
Oh ain't no use in trying
So come on out
Come on out
I know you're in there
I need you now
Cause I'm about to lose it all
And you're the only one I can call on
Know if you hear me I need you
Know if you are listening I'm in trobule
Know if you're there I've falling
And I can't get up
So hurry up
And just say no

Please get me back to me girl
Who's waiting at home
Get me back tonight without doing wrong
And I promise (promise) promise (promise)
Promise (promise) promise (promise)
I'll never ever do it again
Come on out
I know you're in there
I need you now
Cause I'm about to lose it all
And you're the only one I can call on
Know if you hear me I need you
Know if you are listening I'm in trobule
Know if you're there I've falling
And I can't get up
So hurry up
And just say no (no, no, no)

[x6:]
No, no, no
No say no
