You where the one to keep my tears from falling down, by telling me I could go on when all hope is gone and so I sing to you this song... yes I do. like watering flowing from the heart into the soul, you were the one that toke my heart and mended all the broken peices when I was down you picked me up and showed me life, now I can live. I can live because of you I can live [x4]
