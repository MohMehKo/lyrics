Whats up
I don't know why, but i keep going back
Knowin damn well that i shouldn't be doin that
Cause I ain't doin nuthin but makin it worse for me
And I ain't doin nuthin but makin her thirst for me
Dis thing, I can't shake for man
It's a hard mutha fuckin thing to break man
We fuss then fight then I'm spend tha nite man
I know it ain't right man

[Chorus (N2U)]

Baby mama love (that's what it is)
See I be damn if i let my son call another man Daddy
And if u feel like i feel, that's baby  mama love
I don't wanna be with her, but i just can't stand to see her with no body else
I know it's bad but i can't help myself
Baby mama love
See I be damn if i let my son call another man Daddy
And if u feel like i feel, that's baby mama love
I don't wanna be with her, but i just can't stand to see her with nobody else
I know it's bad but i can't help myself
Baby mama love

(talk to 'em man)
Went to da crib, did what we did, til about 6 in da mornin
Wasn't thinking bout havin no kids, just thinkin bout gettin in it on and
On and on and on and on
That's how i got where I'm at, right now
Lemme take it back, right now (let's go)
She was there for me everytime i needed, even when i got a lil lonely
Wasn't even like she was my gurl, it was more like she was my little homie
Deeper, deeper but then you'll never know
Sometimes you lose control
Hardest thing to forget about your system is that...

[Chorus]

Baby mama love (that's what it is)
See I be damn if i let my son call another man Daddy
And if u feel like i feel, that's baby  mama love
I don't wanna be with her, but i just can't stand to see her with no body else
I know it's bad but i can't help myself
Baby mama love
See I be damn if i let my son call another man Daddy
And if u feel like i feel, that's baby mama love
I don't wanna be with her, but i just can't stand to see her with nobody else
I know it's bad but i can't help myself
Baby mama love

(talk to me)
Oh lord, it's gettin crucial, and bein truthful
I don't understand it
Oh i just won't have it
Have her out with anotha nigga out in tha bar
My son with anotha nigga in tha car
Gurl you ain't gonna play me
Cause i'm just gonna be toleratin dis and payin dat
See I pay da bills, i pay da phone
If i catch you here again, homie we gon have a problem
Let it be known, I might not stay here but this is my home
Leave it alone, cause this child is my baby
No if and buts or maybes
Gurl you gon drive me crazy, with this 

[Chorus]

Baby mama love
See I be damn if i let my son call another man Daddy
And if u feel like i feel, that's baby mama love
I don't wanna be with her, but i just can't stand to see her with nobody else
I know it's bad but i can't help myself
Baby mama love
See I be damn if i let my son call another man Daddy
And if u feel like i feel, that's baby mama love
I don't wanna be with her, but i just can't stand to see her with nobody else
I know it's bad but i can't help myself
Baby mama love

(Baby mama love)

Baby mama love
See I be damn if i let my son call another man Daddy
And if u feel like i feel, that's baby mama love
I don't wanna be with her, but i just can't stand to see her with nobody else
I know it's bad but i can't help myself
Baby mama love

Baby mama love
See I be damn if i let my son call another man Daddy
And if u feel like i feel, that's baby mama love
