Never knew I found someone
So special to me
Girl I can't describe
The feeling that you give to me
Take you around the world
Show your my favorite girl
This feeling never gonna change phase

You're all I think about
Baby I wanna shout
You're the only woman
That I ever dream about

I wanna settle down
Never wanna frown
You make me feel like a real man

[Chorus:]
Girl I promise you
I'll be all I can be
You're reaching everyting with me
Cause I promise you
I'll be the one
Who cares that no one else is there but me
Woman I promise you
I'll be more then a man
One who understands you
All these things I say to you
Baby girl I promise you

Baby you know you had
The key to my heart
Together you and me
A future we will start

So come around me girl
And lemme love you

Baby I could be with you
For the rest of my days
Until we grow old and grey

So come to me
I just wanna love you
Place no one upon you

Baby I...

[Chorus]

Baby won't you stay with me a little while [x4]

[Chorus]

Baby won't you stay with me a little while [til end]
