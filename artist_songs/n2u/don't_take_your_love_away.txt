[Talking:]
I'm sorry for what I did baby
Just please come back to me
I didn't mean what I did
I'll never do you wrong again
Listen up

[Verse 1:]
Sitting here and I'm thinking bout
All the good times that we had
Tryna figure out just how
How those good times turned to bad
Hold on don't you go away
It shouldn't be that easy girl
But all you did was perfect girl
And I took advantage girl
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I just want to marry you

[Chorus:]
Girl don't take your love away now
Woman I'm struggling
Can't be without your kissing and hugging
Girl don't take your love away baby
Girl I can't live without you
And you know that it's true honey
What will I do honey
If you take your love away

[Verse 2:]
Stop right there babe
Don't you dare walk out that door
Can we please try to talk it out
We just need to (work it out)
We don't need to (scream and shout)
I don't mean to hurt ya
Girl I'm just tryna get real with you babe
Baby I apologize
And I wanna tell you why
I was so wrong to you babe

[Hook:]
Baby I'm sorry (Baby I'm sorry)
For every time I hurt you
And baby I'm sorry
Every time I was so untrue
Baby I'm sorry
Every time I didn't come home
Baby I apologize
And I'll tell you why
Girl I wanna come home

[Chorus:]
Girl don't take your love away now
Woman I'm struggling
Can't be without your kissing and hugging
Girl don't take your love away baby
Girl I can't live without you
And you know that it's true honey
What will I do honey
If you take your love away

[Talking:]
Yeah
I never meant to hurt you baby
I never meant to leave you
Please just give me one more chance
I need you in my life baby
Trust and believe me
That I need you

[Chorus:]
Girl don't take your love away now
Woman I'm struggling
Can't be without your kissing and hugging
Girl don't take your love away baby
Girl I can't live without you
And you know that it's true honey
What will I do honey
If you take your love away
