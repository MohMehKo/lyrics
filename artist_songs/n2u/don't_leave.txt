Something bout your lips
Something bout your thighs
That brings me to this comclusion baby
Unless it's just an illusion baby
And I'm damn near going crazy
I can't eat
I can't sleep without you
My whole life revolves around you
I refuse to live without you

Don't leave
Don't go
I need you so

Don't leave
Don't go
I need you so

Girl you shouldn't go to class today
Cause I wanna spend a little more time with ya
I cancel all my plans
Just for you
(Just for you the other day)
Cause I'm right around your way
(So pack your booty bag girl)
Pack light
(And don't forget to pack your 12 play)
12 play
So baby I need you to stay

Don't leave
Don't go
I need you so

Don't leave
Don't go
I need you so

We go together like a hand and a glove
(We're a match made in heaven, can't you tell it baby)
Understand that you're the only girl that makes me feel this way
So if there's any thoughts of you leaving me baby
(Erase them from your mind)
Put it out your mind
I can tell you feel the same way too
Don't leave

Don't leave
Don't go
I need you so

Don't leave
Don't go
I need you so
