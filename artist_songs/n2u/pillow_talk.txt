Good morning baby I hope you had a good time last night
Check it out

So tasty like a chocolate-covered candy
All I wanna hear you tell me is that I'm your man
Girl don't you know that I'm your biggest fan
The way you're working me I don't understand

You're my first thought when I wake up
I adore you girl
You're my sunshine my lucky charm
I adore you girl

[Chorus:]
Who is it baby, will you obey
Wanna hear you say
Sounds so good when you call my name
The way you say it you got me feenin
Lost up in it deep inside your love
[repeat]

Tonight your body turned me on again
We're making love never finishing
Once we start it's hard to stop
You're on top and my head drops

You're my first thought when I wake
I adore you girl
You're my sunshine my lucky charm
I adore you girl

[Chorus]

The way you say it girl it's so crazy
That I don't believe that we make love
Whoa

[Chorus]
