(Why ya wanna know, if it was me?
What ya gonna do, if it was me?)

To my niggaz, kinda figures,
With their fingers, on the triggers.

Yo I'm spittin', if it ain't said then it's written,
I fight my mother for the flows that I'm givin'
Never give in, bust shows never missin',
Mad shots to ya chest, learn a lesson.
Your mother's at home and she's sweatin' and she's frettin',
Talk to the Feds, then she's missin',
Say my name, then she's missin',
Spoil my game, then she's missin'.
I'm gonna get 'er when she cookin' in the kitchen,
At night, in her bed when she kippin'.
My gun's rippin', yo there's no slippin',
My gun's rippin', yo there's no slippin'.
When I'm blazin' I'm grazin',
Burnin' bodies like raisins,
Puttin' bodies in basements.
And your crew is erasin',
Well white domination,
So Solid amazin'.

I know what's comin' though, it's more dough,
Flossin my clique, spittin' my flows.
This is my dough, my flow's,
Keepin' niggaz on their knees and tha bitches on their toes.
You see my dough, uh no no,
First lady lettin' all'v her chicks dem know.
Dem know, dem know,
Keepin' niggaz on their knees and tha bitches on their toes.

Why ya wanna know, if it was me?
What ya gonna do, if it was me?
Now I'm makin' the riches, wanna know about me,
But didn't give a fuck about me?
Why ya wanna know, if it was me?
What ya gonna do, if it was me?
Now I'm makin' the riches, wanna know about me,
But didn't give a fuck about me?

Rip out the set, blow up the set,

Messy, as in a guy can't test me,
They're aimin' at my head but I still wear a vest G.
Messy, you better know how to address me,
I stay five with my So Solid family.
Messy, I'm gettin' messy and I'm ready,
I'm goin' platinum and I'm gonna stay steady.
Messy, I'm gettin' messy and I'm ready,
I'm gonna go platinum, stay steady.
MAC's got something to say,
I'm gonna keep on flowin', never fade away, yo.
I know you playa haterz playa hate,
But the more you playa hate the more i make the grade.
I were chillin', now I'm back in shape,
I got a hunger for the mic so I won't hesitate.
I levitate, I elevate, regulate,
Devastate, spit rhythm like a snake.
(Snake snake snake snake snake snake snake snake)
Rhythm like a snake
(Snake snake snake snake snake snake snake snake)

I'm cunnin' when I'm pullin' on my britches,
I'm pullin' switches and britches, and puttin' bullets in snitches.
And here be clockin' an' watchin' my figures wit' a snake eye.
But you niggaz you be fake guys, you be real imitate guys,
Are you watchin' my blink eyes, why you watchin' my blink eyes?
Don't be watchin' my niggaz or no be clockin' my figure,
Becau' my niggaz deliver the death blow, So Solid So.
