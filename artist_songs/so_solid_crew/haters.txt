[Chorus]

So many haters are clocking our figures
So many haters don't like us rakin papers
But all we did was bring garage through
From the underground straight to you
Used to wanna screw and bawl
Now they wanna join the crew

[Mac & Skat-D]

T to the H, U to the G
Thuggin and we'll be till we D.I.E
M to the A to the C that's me
S-K-A-T-D
3 thugs representing so solid family
Stackin the chips an the bricks,
You'll see:.. You'll see

[Mac]

M-a-c's taking over,
Ladies call me cassanova
I thought I told you I'm a so solid soldier
You see me coming in a broke down Nova
Mind out cus you will get run over
Reason be I'm a so solid soldier
Reason be I'm a so solid soldier
Reason be I'm a so solid soldier
I thought that I told ya

[Skat-D]

You wanna hate on me cus I'm the one that's chosen
Looking kinda frozen
L double O flow, you don't know, don't know
So solid is a family, we got a key in this life
To just make it, break it
Hate it don't ya
Ya'll better recognise me like a true solid soldier

[Chorus]

[DJ Swiss]

Now you believe in us
Wanna roll with us
Get lean with us
Before you was hatin us
Are you sure you believe in us
You said we would never bust
Now you hand you roll up and you smoke the dust
Its better you bite the dust
I'm crazy believe me trust
Like a grenade im about to bust
While you playing your hatin us
When I bust all you see is dust
If you're here then your feelin us
I won't sweat but I'm serious
Suicide and dangerous
So solid can you handle us
So solid can you handle us

[Chorus]

[Mac]

Spit,
Crooky nigga going a trip
Use your cast now I'm writing the rich
I quit, now I've had my turn on the rips
I better tripping in the base,
I'm a vocalist
You must be mad, to come on the fray mad
You see your friend and there really your friends dad
Cus if I hit ya will you really defend that
Just remember your wife and 2 kids

[Skat-D]

Yaga Yo
Why you watchin me
Why you clockin me
Why you hatin me
Why you biting me
Is it the ice, I'm on fire
Is it the cream, I got fire
Is it the hits
Is it the whips
Is it the tricks
Please let me know.

[Chorus]

[Mac]

While you be hatin its money I makin
I'm demonstrating, your honey I'm takin
I talk now cus the players are hatin
I'm at home but the front a be waiting

[Skat-D]

It's on this year
Better beware
Clips and we bust like a firing line of duty
It's on this year
Better beware
Clips and we bust like a firing line of duty

[Mac]

Don't give me no bullshit
Hesitant never step to the clique
With a droll like yo and the ice style clips
And the ice on my wrist
Ya'll haters aint shit
So solids my clique
And were making the hits
And were making you sick
And were spitting the bricks
With a thoughtless eclipse

[Chorus to Fade]
