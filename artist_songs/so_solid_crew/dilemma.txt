Attention to all ravers 
Tonight we represent to u the 
So solid crew feat Harvey Mac MC MegaMan 
And a unknown man person called g-man 

We have bad news 
No one knows the whereabouts of MC neutrino 
His family is worried 
He hasn't phoned, 
Been seen any where 
Or sent any post cards
We are defiantly in a mad dilemma. 

Roll the dice number 2 
Happens to be the So Solid crew 
Roll the dice number 4 
Burn out the dance 
Burn out the dance floor 
Roll the dice number 1 
Look at the best DJ your tha don 
Roll the dice roll the dice 
It's the way that were rollin tonite 

I'm like the stars in the sky 
I'm like the moon as so high 
I'm like the sun in the cloud
Garenteed teed to run the ground 
Like like cloud full rain rain 
Dark and grey 
Don't try stepping my way 
M A C like a hawk I prey 
Swep it up n ill take it away. 

It's time to interact MC Harvey im rading the track 
It's time to intercept 
M A C live and direct 
Live n direct n all due respect
