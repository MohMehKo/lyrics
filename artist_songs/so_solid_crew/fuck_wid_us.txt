[INTRO:]
([whisper:] Swiss, Harv. So, Solid. [x2])
So solid, big...

I'm gonna bust, you're gonna rhyme,
I'm gonna bust, you're gonna rhyme,
I'm gonna bust, you're gonna rhyme,
So solid crew (bang) for fun. [x2]

([whisper:] Swiss, Harv. So, Solid. [x2])

[VERSE 1: (HARVEY)]
Your friends close, and your enemies closer,
I'm gonna give you a lyrical dose-a,
I'm the real, I'm a lyrical loaner, loaner, upon the microphone-a,
And to the game, this one to the raver,
And to the fuck, 'til the party blaze-a,
And to the mic my lyric will save ya, break ya, hater. Yo...

my rhythm, my rhythm, my rhythm, my rhythm, my rhythm, my rhythm, my flow.
When I'm on a high, when I'm on a low,
When I wanna break, when I wanna on a roll. [x2]

Recognise that I'm making my dough, so
certain niggas wanna know the way I roll.
The way I roll is strictly to lose control,
until the gold diggers, no-it's a no go.
Until the real niggas, so solid-hype so,
Until the haters watch out your hate.
Yo, blow, another nigga, I wanna get cold,
I'm gonna flip, I'm gonna flip into flip mode.
I'm gonna blow, you know I'm gonna explode,
So solid crew on the road- oh no
I'm gonna make your body reeling,
oh with the lyrical feeling,
wake up, never dreaming,
a few Gs and we're gleaming,
And with the MC others and the ravers believe in.
I'm a dum-a-dum-a demon,
I'm a reason, up with the raving season.

[BRIDGE: (KAISH)]
Jot that- I really wanna hit that,
Harvey's coming back with another chat.
My folks can't test that, test that,
But his rogues can wreck that, wreck that.
DJ Swiss come with production,
beats soundbeats lying in erruption.
Give Kaish for all interaction,
we come with a ruff neck action.

[CHORUS:]
Why, you wanna fuck with us?
Say, why, why, why, why you wanna fuck with us?
E stands for envious,
Say why, why, why, why you wanna fuck with us?

[VERSE 2: (HARVEY)]
Certain things on my chest,
certain things I need to confess,
certain things I need to address,
gonna make money, so I gotta invest.
Now I'm gonna put certain niggas to rest,
If I kill you, then my life's a mess,
give me the mic, and let me do what's best,
express my mental stress.

When I'm on the mic, hype-no contest,
give me mic,
and let me ride-I'm blessed. [x4]

Why? wouldn't wanna fuck with us?
Why? wouldn't wanna fuck with us?
Why? wouldn't wanna fuck with us?
E stands for envious.
Why? wouldn't wanna fuck with me?
Why? wouldn't wanna fuck with me?
Why? wouldn't wanna fuck with me?
Swiss, HAR to the VEY. [x2]
