You think i'm deep?
I go deeper than the graves
Where they bury the foot and mouth sheep
Take a look in my mind
Take a peep
Girls mind when you sleep 'cause
Boom-only i wonder why
Boom- on it we'll never die
Nein in German is nine
Never go there, never combine

These lyrics are just to fill in the time
Until i'm ready to blow your mind
So Solid in time
Bubbler, Swiss, MC Romeo
Lisa Maffia with the Jarrell
Oh No

Promoters when you pay me
Don't screw up your face all bent
All your doin is refunding me
For all of the raving money i spent
That was to pay rent
Haterz don't go and be like that
Screwing up your face in the dark
Don't let me get dark
Don't let me go in the boot of my car
Thats in the car park

Ladies chill
Take your Monday pill
Please don't grill
Romeos on the mic and i'm still
Keeping it real
Until
I make a millllion of the pounds them
With my lyrical sounds them
Turn up the speaker then
'Cause i wanna go deeper then-a
Let me go deeper then

I wanna go
Back in the days when i never had nothing then
Never had enough money to buy all the sweets in the shop
So i put back some of them
Life was harder then
Hey afro, never go barber then
Grew up in a single parent family
Without no father then
So my mum took up harder then

On a scale of 1 to 10
Mum gets 10
Shes like one of the ravers them
up there chilling in V.I.P with her friend [x2]
Don't bother them then

[chorus]
Romeo and Lisa
Don't leave out the maffia
Lyrical flow so buff-ia
So Solid taking you deeper
On the mic i get a
Slow flow to
Bubble on the double to
And leave out the trouble to

Rock garage, rock car park flows
Different beats, different tempos
Different lingos
Thats the way it goes
Voice slows, who knows
Romeo's voice slows
Speed up the tempos
Then lick you with the new flows
I'll lick you with some brand new stuff and that
I'll spark lyrics, i've got nuff of that
I'll big up the girls them buff and that
Press, bump, enough of that
No lyrical flow, slow, sound
I speed up again
As i come again
Lick you with a new trend
Different begginings with different ends
Setting different flows and different trends
It starts where it ends
If its straight then it bends
If it gels then it blends
Should i carry on? That depends
Only if you give me a deadline
Ladies mmm mine
Give me 29 seconds to chat this rhyme

[chorus x2]

I'm gonna lick you with a slow flow
Speed it up and here i go
My lyrical flow
Swear its too hot
Now look there too cold
Whats new can never be old
Lisa the priceless diamond (Lisa hey)
That can never be sold
Swiss produce that track
Give me that beat for my lyrics to unfold
Explode
Release that deeper story
Thats never been told
Could never be us could never be garage
Gonna lick you with the car park flows
Voice slows, then speed up the tempo
Oh No

I wanna go dee-E-per, dee-E-per
Romeo,
Here i go (Romeo)
I don't believe in fans
I believe in supporters
And i don't like reporters
Hypocrites, parasites, perpetrators
Especially haterz

If you don't like me
Don't watch TV, 'cause i'm all over it
If you hate me
Your an obstacle in life, i'm gonna jump over it
My lyrics pause
To give you enough time
To give me a round of applause
I'm breaking rules and laws
To support the cause
And open doors for garage music
Romeo's voice slows and i'm gonna use it

I wanna go deeper (Deeper, deeper)
Back in the day when i blew my first speaker
I wanna go
Dee-E-per, dee-E-per (Deeper, deeper, deeper)
Blow da spea-E-ker, spea-E-ker [x2]

I wanna go dee-E-per, dee-E-per
Blow da spea-E-ker, spea-E-ker
Listen to the cree-E-per, cree-E-per
Buy clothes chee-E-per, chee-E-per

Dee-E-per, dee-E-per
Blow da spea-E-ker, spea-E-ker
Go with the cree-E-per, cree-E-per
And then buy clothes chea-E-per
