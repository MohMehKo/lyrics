Yo blud, yo blud, beg you do me a favour
I beg you tell the world
Or whoever's listenin to this CD
Where the fuck, so solid's comin from

[Kowdean]
And I begin
There was Mega and MAC, PDS and G, the crew fair yee
Right now, in our industry so solid crew LTD

But you never knew, 'bout so solid crew
Until you heard our flow

Tell me what-a you wanna be
