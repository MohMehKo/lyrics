[Verse 1]
If I never been seen never heard
Never happen never occurred
I be there givin out my lyrical word
Oh no that's the word
Oh no that's the word
Never seen never heard
Never happen never occurred
I be there givin out my lyrical word
Oh no that's the word
Oh no that's the word
Romeo's in the premises
I used to be a rapper too but you never knew this
And if you wanna test this
Gonna show you my A double S now kiss this
A so solid crew this
I bet you never knew so solid crew could do this
And if you wanna boo this
Gonna make you jump up move your feet to this

[Chorus]
It's just the little things
The sentimental things in life
About the way we keep the rave alive
So solid when we rock the mic
And if you know what I mean
So solid so I love life
A good beat to make you feel the vibe
So ravers tell me do you like?
[Repeat]

[Verse 2]
I'm never gonna walk on pass
I when I see the buff ladies, split that ass
Don't let it go to your head, I said
This style is tougher than lead
So solid crew bubbler, just like
"Always Coca Cola"
And if you never did know
This style is wicked you know
That's the lyrical flow
When I come through
Lickin with the one two
Lickin with the lyrical flow
You wont know what to do
You gonna sneeze I'm gonna bless you
Lyrical intellect that you never knew
Left, right, left, battle to the death
Keep up to the bass
Get down you gonna get left
My star, from beginning to the end
Repeat it, over again

[Bridge]
I can't stop the music
On the mic I'm gonna lose it
So solids going to bring you the new vibe
To make you feel good inside now
Can't stop the music
On the mic I'm gonna lose it
So solids going to bring you the move right
To make you feel good inside now

[Verse 3]
I better get her home round eight-a eight-a
With the champagne up inside the chiller chiller
I'm telling the girls him is a killer killer
Take a step back, look into the mirror mirror
Surprise surprise like Cilla it's a filler filler
Some of the ladies dem looking to be thinner thinner
So their man dont take em out to dinner dinner
You're new to the game, you beginner
Zim zimmer, who got the keys to my
I'm bout to get her home and get her
Put the champagne up inside the chiller
I'm teaching the girls him is a killer, a killer
Zim zimmer, who got the keys to my
I'm bout to get her home and get her
Put the champagne up inside the
I'm teaching the girls him is a, is a, is a
[Chorus:]
It's just the little things
The sentimental things in life
About the way we keep the rave alive
So solid when we rock the mic
And if you know what I mean
So solid so I love life
A good beat to make you feel the vibe
So ravers tell me do you like?
[Repeat]

[Verse 4]
When I was a kid like in my younger days, a craze
Was a raggedy down with a phase, a phase 
Me and my crew, wanted to be like the craze
And play for double dance, with my face
???
Were the days of the bugger buggies, and of my jeeps
Kinda the cash and the bass from the place
My teacher gave me straight A's
From the kid, listen to the sound that I'm giving you
Gonna make you break dance digga do
Listen carefully, to my life story
Alpha-bet-ic-ally
R, as we represent the fact, that Romeo's here, then
O, as we go on and on, don't have no fear, then
M, what M stands for more, with the mix in store, then
E, as you notice the energy, stamp your feet on the floor, then
O, stands for Oh no time to go, my lyrical flow
Vocal sounds of the Romeo
If you don't know
Better get to know
