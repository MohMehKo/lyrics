It was a dark dark night, I couldn't wait for the first sign of daylight 
Dark side sound, going through my head making the room spin around 
Suddenly dark side bass hits me in the face, knocks me round and round the place 
That was a clue, its Romeo in the rave rollin through
When I say oh no treble turns off in my voice into sub low
It it's time to roll shining up in the sky like a star of the show 
When I'm bussin' the dark, DJ mixing the track like he's touchin the dark
That was clue number two, its Romeo in the rave rolling through 

You saw me lying there and left me all alone, with all the misery and all those memories
It wasn't fantasy this is reality, was it the chemistry, was it the chemistry, no room for you and me
What made you creep away, you ripped my heart in two, I need to touch your face 
I need to feel you babe I need you here with me but things won't be that way 
No things won't be that way

Yo, who can flow like we flow, yo bringin' it down in every show 
Yo, wanted to follow my lingo and if you don't know you fuckin' better go go pay a pro
Yo, who can flow like we flow, yo bringin' it down in every show 
Yo, wanted to follow my lingo and if you don't know you fuckin' better go go play a pro 
Gonna get down to rock sound if I never break you down all around 
If I never said we gonna party like a solid party, where you sane and a fall around
I'm a gonna lick you now with my limbo, I'm a gonna make you talk my lingo 
Chill out sit relax, now kiss my big toe, cause I rock all my flows now that's how I go yo 
You saw me you saw me 
You saw me you saw me 
You saw me lying there and left me all alone, with all the misery and all those memories
It wasn't fantasy this is reality, was it the chemistry, was it the chemistry, no room for you and me
What made you creep away, you ripped my heart in two, I need to touch your face 
I need to feel you babe I need you here with me but things won't be that way 
No things won't be that way
Can't even touch me, don't even know me, what don't you test me come on and show me 
Yeah they gotta big up all the other MCs that when they get upon the mic and they come on it's Romey
Can't even touch me, don't even know me, what don't you test me come on and show me 
Yeah they gotta big up all the other MCs that when they get upon the mic and they come on it's Romey
It's the mega man upon the mic here with Romey, It's the mega man upon the mic here come show me 
It's the mega man upon the mic here with Romey, nigga ya' lone g, susselent homey 
It's the mega man upon the mic here with Romey, It's the mega man upon the mic here come show me 
It's the mega man upon the mic here with Romey, nigga ya' lone g, susselent homey 
Mirror, mirror on the wall who's the darkest of them all, is to be questioned, what does it lead to 
(An investigation) Nobody know, I will keep the people left up at the top 
It's my lyrical flow, as I go, oh no it's time to...
