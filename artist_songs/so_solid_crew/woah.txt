See when your raving out, you here a cheer and you shout out loud 
And out your pocket something drops out,
You turn around, and you lose your crowd 
I tink, I tink lost my tings
Look down and see, you see your key on string 
See then the man upon the decks mixing 
We're pumping it up cause it's so boom with I'm with I'm with I'm

Maybe we're just too hard for ya

More less More Soul, I'll rip your torso 
And the lyrics that I drop, are they gonna flop no 
Who wanna test Asher D let me know
Ride to the people I'm the star of the show
Ha you really wanna tes' this flow 
Can't touch cash if you don't make dough 
Check out my lyrical style and my flow 
Check out the roll' and the ice and my toe 
Heights now some of you cant come close to 
So Solid Crew postal 
Style when I flow for you my Rolex and the deck 
Ha I'm a gon' show it to you 
Know where I'm going to, forget where I'm coming from
I'll be showing you, So Solid Crew joking you 
See they're god damn hurt, set smoke to you 
Where you gonna play, when I'm rocking your day 
And when I say you're never gonna step in my way 
Ha, I remember back in the day
Never had money tell me what did they say 
Never gonna make it with the lyrical play 
When I rock you to the rhythm, becomes a ontray 
Right gold Rolex, that's engraved in ya' name
Do it were gon' make money today 
Do it were gon' make money today 
Do it were gon' make money today 
Money today 
Money today 
Money m, money m, money today 
Do it were gon' make money today 
Do it were gon' make money today 
Check this
Maybe we're just too hard for ya
Maybe we're just too hard for ya
Check this, Check this
