you never knew how many chicks i've dicked,
because you told me you hating my clique,
you never loved because your heads so thick,
you've always hated me and my clique.

[Chorus Kaish:]
Everybodies coming , get their running to this,
its so, its so scandalous,
please tell me why you wanna piece of this,
why you wanna slice of the platinum hits

is it the car? is it the chicks?
sos can you handle it?
is it the money? is it the fame?
sos can you handle it?

Are you a friend of mine?
im not about any chat behind,
you grown ups stepping up in line,
you wanna switch its best you mind,
its the last damn time,
a friend of mine,
you never know i will spit with the story interhyme,
with a deep base line
and my so solid crew nodding their heads in time,
if you think you will find,
that a running design,
and that shit is behind,
because i'm spitting my rhyme,
think i'm losing my mind,
yea one day you will find a friend of mine,
is he a friend of mine?
yea one day you will find a friend of mine
a friend of mine
is he a friend of mine?

[Chorus Kaish]

back in the day you hating this dick,
now you niggas wanna roll with my clique,
now you niggas wanna roll with my clique,
i'm gonna rip this, fit this, hit this,
and you know you niggas cant get with this,
we're gonna blow this, rip this, show this,
