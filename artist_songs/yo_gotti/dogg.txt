I'm a street nigga
All I ever wanted was a plug
And I never had no budget
'Cause I got it out the mud
Mike WiLL Made-It

Fly shit only
I be dressed in latest fashion (sauce)
Always had the fast cars
Always end up crashin' (skrrt, skrrt)
Mike WiLL Made-It got it, we gon' body niggas
Kill them this December
I done really shot at niggas
So miss me with that rap beef
I done really got it niggas
Went from makin' mills with Mexicans
To closin' deals with Jigga (HOV)
I'm lit, I got your bitch on my wood [?]
I'm rich, but I'm still tryna save the trap

I'm your rapper's favorite rapper and the trappers love me
When it come to bein' real, no other rapper but me
I got blood on my PM, my feet on the concrete
Make your bitch sit on this dick, I got her on a dog leach (woo, woo)
I got her on a dog leash (woo, woo)
I got her on a dog leash
I'm a dog ass nigga and you know it (hoe, you know it)
Bitches like my dog ya 'cause you borin' (yeah, you borin')

Chef (skrrt), foreign (skrrt)
I could switch them out (damn)
Trappin' (skrrt), tourin' (skrrt)
I could switch them out (damn)
Plane flooded (skrrt), I could switch them out (damn)
Corporate, thuggin', I could switch it out

Dog hoes (ruff), play by dog rules (ruff)
Young niggas in my hood on their dog food (ruff)
I'ma train that bitch, send that hoe to dog school (dog school)
Her friend like girl, don't fuck that nigga, he gon' dog you (damn)

Streets a voucher, I'm that nigga (I am)
Front row Grammy's, I'm with Jigga
Back at home, I'm a killa
On that road, I'm with hittas
I voted for Obama but didn't vote for Donald Trump (why?)
'Cause he told my plug he can't come back 'cause this ain't where he from
Mexicans, they my dogs, so if they gon' build that wall (dogs)
We gon' have to have a street protest 'cause that gon' hurt us all
Flippin' packs like I work at IHOP, a waffle house (flip it)
Nigga play with me, I shoot him out
We ain't talkin' money what we talkin' bout
Principle, morals
Tourists
I had the green like a florist (florist)
You sing that song like a chorus [Chorus:]
You brought all of your boys in (yeah)
You a rat nigga, you a disgrace (yeah)
You the fuck nigga, in the first place
I hate niggas like you, in the worst way
Now I need a blessin' in a church way
Pray for me (pray for me)
If you don't like me and I don't like you, then stay away from me (please)
That pussy good I'm a dog baby can you wait for me?

Dog hoes (ruff), play by dog rules (ruff)
Young niggas in my hood on their dog food (ruff)
I'ma train that bitch, send that hoe to dog school (dog school)
Her friend like girl, don't fuck that nigga, he gon' dog you (damn)

They ain't never lie (lie)
I ain't never try (try)
Do the right thing (damn)
I'm from that other side (from that other side)
I'm a dog ass nigga and I know it (hoe, you know it)
Bitches like my dog ya cause you borin' (boy, you know)
You too nice to these hoes
Boy, be wifin' these hoes
I'm like a scanner on these bitches, I be swipin' these hoes (ha, ha)
Yeah, I be swipin' these hoes (swipe, swipe)
Yeah, I be swipin' these hoes (yeah)
Switch 'em out, fuckin' dismiss 'em (switch 'em, miss 'em)
You eat 'em and kiss 'em (kiss 'em)

Err, yeah

Yeah

Gotta made it
