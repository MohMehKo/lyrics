[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I'm from the hard knock life, that all white life
Pop a wheelie on that 4 wheeler yea that's that bike life
Niggas ghost like casper catch me in a ghost with drop head after
You a slave master, rob your own kind blind lean blind
And I ain't join your team cause I got my own grind
Got my own mind, sold my own 9's, fifty five hundred like a hundred's some times

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
Once you put your hand on that pot
Ain't no turning around, ain't no turning around
Once you bush your first Glock
Ain't no turning around, ain't no turning around
Once you jump off that porch (young nigga)
Ain't no turning around, ain't no turning around
These streets hot as a torch (young nigga)
Ain't no turning around, ain't no turning around

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I'm from the hard knock life, that all black life
It's making sales on a mountain bike, yeah, that's that crack life
Break a whole one down and sell 'em all next
Couple days later, four door six
Love to let the semi spray every day's a henny day
Fuck it they gon charge you like you an adult anyway
Yeah, just look at those that took a nap
When you're on the road to riches, nigga, ain't no looking back

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Shots fired men down, say's he was hands down
Police brutality, nigga, this reality
Trayvon Martin in a all black hoodie
Young nigga big 40 waiting on a bully
Big benz is the world on drugs
Watching CNN and seen my God damn plug
Watching BET and seen my God damn self
I have more love for these streets than my God damn self

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Uhh Yea haha!
Young niggas wyling, shooting shit rapidly
To give him ten years, they do that happily
They don't understand, they bringing down the faculty
Ain't worried about the fronters, it's the niggas that's in back of me
Grown man b.I., and that's how they handle it
Reputation is everything, it's over when you're damaging
Money is easy to get, is just hard to manage it
Always remember the rules before you put your hand in it

[Verse 5: Yo Gotti]
Before you put your hand in it
You got to be the man in it
You Got to understand it, got to know the rules to the game
Got to sacrifice, got to know it's a five year sentence for a brick of white
That's if your record clean Lord knows it's a poor sight
Caugh up in the snitch, smash on em' you don't match now
Remember what I told you, fuck it, you can turn your back now
Once upon a time he was real, he a rat now
Never turn your back on niggas that you thug with
Bitch that you really like, never fall in love with
Never seen you plug with the money up front
If you smoke get your own kush don't hit a nigga blunt
Remember dope gon sale and bitches gonna leave
Soon Niggas go to jail, so that's a day from hell
Young nigga oh well, thinking he a player
Now he living through his pictures on the wall and his mall
But he ain't tell, so nigga I salute em'
And when he hit the streets again, making sure he eat again
He won't be a beast again, hit em' with a key again
For eighteen five, young nigga go live
