I got a check, check, check, beep.
Bitch I got a check, check, check
Bitch I got a check, check, check

I buy anything I want, 'cause I got a check,
Fuck any bitch I want, 'cause I got a check.
I only ride foreign 'cause I got a check.
You know I'm fully armed, you ain't gotta check
And every time you see me I be on a deck
Looking like money, smelling like a jet,
Brand new swag, got me on flex.
Whole lot of cash, I'm a walking check.

Uh, I got my check up, I need a check-up.
Watch on me so cold, checking on me so froze.
Check, I got them hoes, check, designer clothes,
I got them bows, plus I got them o's.
Going hard, nigga, I do too,

Valet park nigga there's my coupe
Popping bottles nigga, there's my crew.
That pussy good, ass fat, head right, nigga, that's my boo.
A real nigga, you ain't one, hate on me, that's what you do.
Uh, I'm in my zone, uh, my money long,
Sipping on that is so rock, inhaling all of the strong.
On my young nigga shit, rolling with the belt,
I'm on my rich nigga shit, Rolls Royce are better.

I buy anything I want, 'cause I got a check,
Fuck any bitch I want, 'cause I got a check.

Got a bad girls club, a gang of bad bitches
Black down, A.P., on spill, B.P., white them, mula
No damning, hair blow, ace of spades, no cards.
Go to pee and glow in the dark.
