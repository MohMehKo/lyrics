[Hook - Yo Gotti:]
I know Colombians, and amigos
I'm the neighborhood hero
If I front everyone a kilo
I might be a superhero
I know Colombians, and amigos
I'm the neighborhood hero
And when that choppa go beast mode
Don't try to be no super hero

[Verse 1 - Yo Gotti:]
When there work on the way, this shit can get real
Money got caught on the highway, fucked up a mill
And the plug from Medellin
But I keep shooters on the team
And I come up like [?]
Mama I will never be a failure
Ain't no telling what I sell ya
I got shit rock bricks, locked up in the trailer
I'm the neighborhood hero
Fishing for a lick, ya nigga nemos
I heard they got me on the fedness
Niggas beefin' for the bricks like I'm on craiglist

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Shy Glizzy:]
Bitch I just left out of Puerto Rico
I was fucking with them amigos
And Jefe been fucking with the coco
But we gon' keep that on the d-low
In the suite with 3 hoes
Choppas for my young niggas, that be at your [?]
Chichi super heros, chichi we got kilos
If ya wanna act, we gon' shoot ya like D. Rose
Niggas call me ironman, cause I keep the irons man
Nigga, I got the weight, you selling dimes man
Snort this line man, turn to Frankenstein man
Chopping out of section 8, I keep my nine man

[Hook]
