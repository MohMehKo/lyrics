I heard it's over trap niggas, word to the rap niggas
Word to the enemy, I've never been into that
I know niggas doing life sentences, some of 'em innocent (for real)
But they'll never tell on they man, what them niggas hatin'
Who came through when they dropped here before the deal? Me
Who bought himself out of his contract for half a mil? Me
Who kept the streets alive? Me, who put his niggas on? Me
Who rode with you right or wrong? Me, and repped the streets in every song
I know young would meet your fate, pumped to me with 40C
I dodgin' life sentence, niggas soakin' shit, discourage me
Get a big ol bag of money if he try encourage me
Say it cost to be the boss when you say I paid the fee, nigga

[Yo Gotti:]
Walk in the studio and into the booth, talk to the microphone (mic shit)
Tell 'em about your life and about the shit you be standin' on (I am)
How you put your niggas up (I did), how you fucked a thousand bitches (true)
But you never leave your home (I can't do it)
Bitches is bitches and family is family, for real
Rappin' was cool but dope boy was payin' the bills
Friends they hate, they frenemies, they're not your enemies
They really don't like you, they hate, just envious energy
You know the power of money, the power of fame
Bitches fuck on a nigga (for real), knowin' he lame
Damn to say it ain't personal for the shoes and the purses
It's like we said in the verse, the money ain't worth it, I can't do it
