Niggas playing Pac-man, chasing power pennies,
I'm playing Call of Duty with that main lady.
If devil in the zone I shoot it long
And if you go against the team is bad, call me hell at it.
Lord, forgive me for my sins, I'm just trying to get the billions.
In the kitchen with the pirates, land brick, I gotta make a stretch.
Spread your wings, let me see you fly,
Can you bring the nigga back, twenty five.
I rob a bank, damn, she still with double face nigga.

Work, where is that?
Work, quit saying that.
Work, what you mean with that?
Work, thousand grant man.
Work, where is that?
Work, quit saying that.
Work, what you mean with that?
Work, thousand grant man.

God, forgive me for my sins,
I fucked the game, tired of making plans.
Broke a brick down, tried to buy billions,
Diamonds all black, caught it, take it for the teens.
I bought a big house with a fence
And had to pay taxes for them ams.
I paid what was off in ninety six,
I pay cars off since since.
Fly with a model, drinking out the bottle,
She don't like to drink but sure she like to swallow,
Early on the road, grabbing on the faulty,
Fifty in the morning spend sixty in the party.

Work, where is that?
Work, quit saying that.
Work, what you mean with that?
Work, thousand grant man.
Work, where is that?
Work, quit saying that.
Work, what you mean with that?
Work, thousand grant man.

That boy shit, boom, turn on,
I have plans on the hoe, will she burn up?
You nigga fighting over hoe, you kidding me,
So you think that bitch belong to you? You shitting me.
Fly like shit, real nigga, we don't holla at shit,
This real, that chain, these watches, my shit.
Gold chain is the side shit, black creator and it's popping.
Standing on the couches with my head calling,
I'm in this bitch acting like it's my spot,
Lights on us, plankton, you know it breaks all us, granted.

Work, where is that?
Work, quit saying that.
Work, what you mean with that?
Work, thousand grant man.
Work, where is that?
Work, quit saying that.
Work, what you mean with that?
Work, thousand grant man.
