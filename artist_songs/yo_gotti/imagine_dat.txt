[Intro:]
Ya
Aye you know this The Art of Hustle
On this album nigga, it's all about the laws all about the rules and shit that mean shit
So today nigga we talking about loyalty
We going back and fuck with everybody we started with

[Verse 1:]
Ya, they want that old Gotti flow so I went and got drama
Classic Memphis shit bitch we about to do some numbers
I get money with the Mexicans but I can't trust the runners
So focused on the money it's like I'm looking through a tunnel
Yea that tunnel vision 20/20 on you snitches
Get popped gon do your time or nah that's against my religion
Ain't no competition I'm the realest nigga in it
Fuck your favorite rapper tell 'em I said it and I meant it
When I'm in your city know I'm mobbing with them semis
I talk that gangsta shit but pussy this is not a gimmick
I want a 'rari fuck a Hemi
A Lamb' fuck a 'vette
The realest in these streets awards goes to

[Chorus:]
Imagine dat

[Verse 2:]
They give another award to a fuck nigga I might jump on stage like Kanye
Got Taylor Swift and Beyonce nominated what the streets say
Fuck a Grammy I'll take a million dollars right now
Free all the real niggas right now
Hustler of the year
Boy I move my mamma out the hood
I took my niggas out the hood
I'm good in any nigga hood
I'm good in any nigga city
We fucking all these niggas bitches
No security my young niggas with me
Choppas and anybody can get it for real
Box of baking soda trophy
When you battle rap you get murked
Niggas only need prayer in church
Fresh to death red carpet hearse
If Pimp C was the host
If BMF had a set
And the realest in these streets award goes to who

[Chorus:]
Imagine dat
They gave awards to the real niggas
Imagine dat
They gave Grammies to the drug dealers
Imagine dat

Imagine dat
They had a Grammy for the drug dealers
Imagine dat
This shit a movie where the Oscar

No rappers I got killers on my roster
