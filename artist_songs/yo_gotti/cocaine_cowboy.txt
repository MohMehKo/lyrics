Move to Miami until I'm closer to board
Everybody know Yo Gotti sell drugs
Brand new fathom ain't sell no record
He a dope boy, that's why the streets respect us
Fuck around nigga I ain't touched no bricks
About this work and they ain't done shit
Push the clown that nigga sugar when I bluff
You ain't never drop down to hear a nigga with your glock
You ain't never bought a block and [?] that bitch out the rap
So quit saying you a dope boy, you just a romper
Nigga play with this game like it's a motherfucking joke
This my motherfucking coat I get a street nigga's quote

Clear up the rumors, let me talk to the streets
All that publicity shit hoe, that ain't no beef
Niggas killing in Memphis, laying shots off the muscle
One thing I learned from my brother, real killers don't talk
Shit I know how to move and I think like a boss
I spit the shit that I live it's the shit I would talk
It's the shit I'm a die for [?]
I'm a real nigga and I don't stare
Leave me with that fake shit cause I don't play
Niggas with me tear his whore rib
They tryin to trick me off the streets so I can go

Dope boy nigga like I'm from Detroit
Young wretched nigga from no Memphis the street
305 live I have export, import
King B shit nigga cocaine cowboy
I'm a cocaine cowboy
I'm a cocaine cowboy
I import export
I'm a cocaine cowboy
