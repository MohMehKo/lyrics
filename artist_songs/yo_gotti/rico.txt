[Verse 1:]
My home boy rico, fell in love with kesha
Full time freak bitch part time teacher
Me and kesha cool 'cause I use to fuck tammy
That's her lil sista just moved to miami
Kesha was the driver when I was takin trips to mexico
Got the head once and I ain't even fuck the hoe
Course I told rico now tammy can't stand me
Before I fucked the bitch me and him was like family
And kesha start hangin round niggas shouldn't trust her
But money over bitches that my mothefuckin brother
Sticking to the g-code, fuck one of these stank hoes
Of course I went told what she said back to rico
Rico gott mad excelled and start clicking
Pulled his pistol out and told me stay up out his business
Told me he would kill me if I ever fucked his bitches
And he ain't pay me shit for them last five chickens
Rico trippin out rico know I ain't no hoe
Rico know he should have killed me
Rico know I ain't gone go
Rico still fuckin kesha, kesha still fuckin up
Rico still owe me a hundred grand and plan on running off
Rico mama know my mama we like family rico smart
But if rico know what I know can't no one save him but god
I know rico ain't no sucka rico gutta he got heart
Rico merked so many niggas but his weakness is a broad
Now rico fuckin tammy 'cause he wanna pay back kesha
Kesha wanna pay back rico, I don't give a fuck bout neither
This bitch kesha so fucked up she been fuckin with da needle
Gave dat bitcch a couple stacks she called rico up to meet her
Rico walked into the house I was sittin right on the couch
Rico thought he saw a ghost kesha standing right by the door
Rico one shot to the head, kesha screaming out he dead
Uu' know I can't leave no witness kesha pow, I fled

[Chorus:]
If uu; a real nigga then uu' stand for sumthing
By the way never change gotta stand for something
My heart made of ice and these streets made of gold
One thing about it I don't love these hoes
I want it 'cause I got it and it lookin official
Chapter one teach u not to love these bitches
Chapter two'll teach u that the game ain't work
Chapter three show u that the streets don't care

[Verse 2:]
Jesse a old ass player jesse kind of like my plug
Jesse always got gud work but he don't never show no love
I think jesse take my money and they front him what he buy
Maybe jesse a middle man using my shit to get by
Jesse prices be too high but I heard he work for nino
Jesse a full time gambler he met nino at the casino
On the cool jesse strong mane I heard he getting a c-note
That a hundred of them I'll knock his meat out his borito
Jesse home boy dede he be fuckin with that white
Dede pose to be his goon he catching bodies every night
Me and dede went to skool together me and dede tight
5th period mr. anotchie class I was sellin dede white
I been playing under dede tryin to get up under jesse
Maybe I'll meet up with nino and get me a connection
Jesse always getting robbed they don't respect him in the streets
Dede told me nino always asking questions bout me
But jesse always put me down nino got to play it safe
So in others words nino do whatever jesse say
Jesse playing like he straight nino moved back to LA
Dede told me jesse llove some bitches down in M I A
Nino flew us out to cali he gone take us to the grammys
I pulled up on jesse he was front seat with tammy
Tammy looked me in my eyes jesse looking at her strange
Thinking bout what dede told me tammy holding jesse change
Me and dede in the lobby told him I was leaving soon
When I left I saw that tammy bitch come out of nino room
Okay nino fucking tammy tammy holding nino work
And jesse ain't got a clue 'cause if he do he will be hurt
A long story short I took a trip to 305
Kicked in that tammy bitch door and got 100 something pies
Now dede looking for me but he fuck off with my guys
A quarter thing soft they knocked his brain off threw his eyes
Nino nino nino nino nino nino, nino nino nino nino nino nino

[Chorus:]
If uu; a real nigga then uu' stand for sumthing
By the way never change gotta stand for something
My heart made of ice and the streets made of gold
One thing about it I don't love these hoes
I want it 'cause I got it and it lookin official
Chapter one teach u not to love these bitches
Chapter two'll teach u the game ain't fun
Chapter three will show u that the streets don't care
