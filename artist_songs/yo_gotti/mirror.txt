Hustle game incredible ice game amazing... look in the mirror [x4]
Like a chandler you looking in a mirror
Ice super clear you looking in a mirror
Who you hear to see when you look in the mirror
If you a real nigga you looking in the mirror

Hustle game incredible ice game amazing... look in the mirror [x4]

[Verse 1:]
6 in the morning my alarm goes off
Dope come out the pot then the stove goes off
Knock knock on the door I'm selling wholes of soft
Nigga try to rob me get his nose blowed off
I'm I a real nigga point blank period
If you a pussy nigga you need to be paying for your period
Damn right I'm getting money have a million on the jewlery
Go in ask emmit if you don't think a nigga serious
My whole house glass I'm looking at reflections
I'm cocaine crazy got a all white section
All my niggas mafia I never even heard ya
Quarter brick half a brick my young niggas a murder ya

[Verse 2:]
Wake up in the morning in a wash my face
Brush my teeth in but my gun on my waste
Loui belt check loui shoes check car on my wrist in a house on my neck
Last I remember I was standing on garland
Buying 10 for the hundred out of ridgecrest apartments
B.E.T material I'm 106 in park and I'm a stay gucci dead fresh homie regardless
I repersent the dopeboys I can't say it clearer
You looking at me wen you looking in the mirror
I motivate the trap give the hood niggas hope
Because I became a millionaire wen I was selling dope... I'm yo gotti

[Verse 3:]
Live from the kitchen it's the pyrex king
Straight from north memphis to your tv screen
Couple foreign cars all white everything
Keep a cool hundred grand in my levi jeans
White in red cutlass same color as a smearnoff
1 ticket 2 ticket I can take a year off
Got my money up think I'm moving were the beach at
Next house somewhere famous were the fuck is robin leech at
