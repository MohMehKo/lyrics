Gloc 40, dope money make my pance sag
White tee, red hat, no flag

[VERSE: YO GOTTI]
I'm a gasta nigga, I got a gansta grill
A nigga signed with stunna got like a half of mill
Alot hating they don't wanna see a gangsta chill
But fuck it I'm a tell em how a gansta fill
I seek the industry fake, cause ain't no ganstas in it
But every motherfucker wanna play that gangsta image
Niggas rap about bricks then they get all excited
I rap bout dope cause I sold & pray I don't get endited
And I ain't throwing no signs, claiming no colors or shit
But got that p-90 rouger & it can get ugly in this bitch
My city watching my rearview, I'm speaking in codes
Cause I'm a gansta & I stay in gangsta mode,
Look I'm a gansga

[VERSE: WEBBIE]
Feast your eyes on a g, you suprised yeah it's me
Keep my eyes in the mirror, 4-5 on my seat
Ride mine on them feet, I can ride on any street
I ain't even gotta hide from a nigga cause I'm street

All my niggas k-ed up, ready for what for what ever come
Yeah a nigga getting money stunting ain't no thing to me
Dem hoes saw my phantom coming thougth I was jermaine dupree
Just hollered at my nigga b, I told it's time to roll
He told me nigga I kno, I told him nigga let's go
Gangsta musik 2 let's give the streets thath on there
And I bet a million real niggas go get this bitch of the shelf
And bet lil niggas will love to, stop me & my lil thug to
Trill fenta lock it, bitch watch it me & my lil thug to
Everybody show us love, so us we just show them love to
You fuck with a busta, we bust him up, you get drugged to

I spit this shit from the bottom of my stomach
So try some I knock the bottom out ya stomach

In love with guns & he can't stop clubing,
Never could tell him nothing
Fuck real g's, with big nuts who flip keys on highways
Player made niggas, man who flip hoes off myspace
Luxery in driveways let your roof back nigga
That half of pill ain't doing the job, then throw ya two back nigga
My time to shine niggas playing, but I'm bout my bussines
Lats to drop, but off the top, the whole world know I'm the sickest,
Red monkey's to dickies, nigga got every color
From yo stae to 28, niggas got many hustles
My brothers the trill fam, love me because I'm loyal
Duke keep his shit straped, because my watch will get me kidnaped, from my block to yo trap
Niggas heads get bust, feds get dust
My trill niggas out here ready to bust
It's gansta
