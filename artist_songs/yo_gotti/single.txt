Single, single
Go go go go go
Stuey up in the building
Single single single
I'm single for the night
I'm single, I'm single

[Chorus:]
Say I need a single so here ya go
Nigga say he need a single I told em 24
She ask me am I single I told her damn right
Yeah she got a man but she single for the night
Single single single single single
She single for the night
Single single signle single single signle
I'm single for the night

Trap talk homie say he wanna single
Hood nigga [?] and a can of pringles
I get paid to hit the club I don't come to mingle
How you let a nigga kill you on ya own single
Hit a single button and my whole top gone
Hit my plug up and put my whole block on
40 Glock on 32 shots strong, 70 bands 100 carats one watch on
I'm single 10 carats on my finger looking for a thick bad bitch like Trina
She committed but still let me hit it if it's bout a single dollar then you know that I'm with it

[Chorus:]
Say I need a single so here ya go
Nigga say he need a single I told em 24
She ask me am I single I told her damn right
Yeah she got a man but she single for the night
Single single single single single
She single for the night
Single single signle single single signle
I'm single for the night

Sell em by the single but I buy em by the pairs
Talkin squares all white like some Nike Airs
Single horse on the car couple hundred grand
Single pots single stove single wedding bands
Yeah I'm married to the game what you know about it
Young fly rich nigga ask ya ho about it
4 singles in a split, pair of red bottoms
Yeah we rock'em like they jordans whole squad got'em
Single, dope boy announcement, standin on the couches middle finger to the bouncers
I am, like Queen Latifa I'm out here livin single ask about me in the hood I got more stripes than the Bengals

[Chorus:]
Say I need a single so here ya go
Nigga say he need a single I told em 24
She ask me am I single I told her damn right
Yeah she got a man but she single for the night
Single single single single single
She single for the night
Single single signle single single signle
I'm single for the night
