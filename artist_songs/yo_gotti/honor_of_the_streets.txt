In the honor of the streets
I won a trophy cause I sold so many keys
Where either the activist or the antifreeze
I been on the road and my driver stop me in Atlanta please
By magic city so I can see the luscious sky
Don't hold cheese, takin out the rapper
Boy I'm not a rapper, legendary trapper
Double OG riding in the Audi with the four o's on em
Its not a spaceship if it ain't got the lift up golds on em
Old school colors the chevy, still got the fours on em
Mac 11 and the tech still got the hold on em
Ooh I never planned to seen a nigga
But I bought a gucci louie and a prada
Then I went to men in blue a free dollar
Boy I spent a band like I'm on a collar
X's on the shirt that's davinnci
Gangstas in my phone you don't hear me
No response no response
Treat the bitch like she is no return
I don't fuck with it
There's blow in the kitchen I fuckwith it
There's snow in the town know it come with it
There's more money to get
The honor of the streets
Shawty got the new chanel bag, trophy
Young nigga got a rolley, and that's a trophy...
When you pull ya whip in the hood nigga that's ya trophy
Know you lookin good stuntin on nigga. just how you post it
Pockets full of blue hunnits nigga that a trophy
First I copped a 550 now I'm in a woah
Versace sace had to introduce her plus I'm walkin on my gellas like I used too
In the honor of the streets I'm in the kitchen whippin whippin wrist [?]
