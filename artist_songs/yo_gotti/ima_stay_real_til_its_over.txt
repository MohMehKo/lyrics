Get yo money my nigga don't change up and stay a real Nigga foeva

Go buy a couple cars when dey think they ain't da same
You got da whole world fooled homie you should be ashamed
Speak like a gangster but he so lame
Front me show me bricks and I'll take em'
North Memphis raised jus as gutta as they make em'
Live from da kitchen I'm jus doing my thang Free hip hop keep yo head up wayne
Cocaine musik Nigga what da fuck you thought it was set da record straight cause I don't know
