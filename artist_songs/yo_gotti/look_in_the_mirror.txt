[Chorus:]
I’m on fire, whole hood blazin 
Hustle game incredible, ice game amazing 
Look in the mirror [4x]

Like a chandelier, look in the mirror 
Ice super clear, you looking in the mirror 
Who you here to see when you look in the mirror 
If you a real nigga, you lookin in the mirror 

I’m on fire, whole hood blazin 
Hustle game incredible, ice game amazin 
Look in the mirror [4x]

[Verse 1:]
Six in tha morning, my alarm goes off 
Dope come out tha pot then the stove goes off 
Knock knock on tha door, I’m sellin wholes on soft 
Nigga try to rob me, get his nose blowed off 
Am I a real nigga? Point blank period 
If you a pussy nigga, you need pads fa ya period 
Damn right I’m getting money, half a million on tha jewelry 
Just go and ask Emmet if you don’t think a nigga serious 
My whole house glass, I’m lookin at a reflection 
I’m cocaine crazy, got a all white section 
All my niggaz mafia I never even heard of ya 
Quarter brick, half a brick, my young niggaz’ll murder ya 

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Wake up in the morning and I wash my face 
Brush my teeth and put my gun on my waist 
Louis belt (check) Louis shoes (check) 
Car on my wrist and a house on my neck 
Last I remember I was standing on Garland 
Buyin ten for tha hundred outta Ridgecrest Apartments 
BET material I’m 106 & Parkin’ 
And I’mma stay Gucci dead fresh on ‘em regardless 
I represent tha dope boyz, I can’t say it clearer 
You lookin at me when you lookin in tha mirror 
I motivate the trap, yeah the hood niggaz hope 
Because I became a millionaire when I was sellin dope, I’M YO GOTTI 

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Live from the kitchen, it’s tha pyrex king 
Straight from North Memphis to ya tv screen 
But before it comes, “All White Everything” 
Keep a few hundred grand in my Levi jeans 
White and red Cutlass, same color as a Smirnoff 
One ticket, two tickets, I can take a year off 
Got my money up, think I’m movin where da beach at 
Lifestyle of tha hood and famous, where da fuck is Robin Leach at? 

[Chorus]
