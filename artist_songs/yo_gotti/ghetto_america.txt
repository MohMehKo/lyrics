Drinking all America,
Allow it from the hood I'm from,
From every nigga in a truck, every nigga in a sloan,
Drinking all America,
Someone tell the president,
My neighborhood like Afghanistan, bombs deal and play with it.
Drinking all America,
Tell Iraq I got that oil, got that purple, got that all,
Nigga what you're paying for?
Drinking all America,
Bitch, that ain't my private stuff,
Cocaine music book, CMB, all white block.
Drinking all America,
Work without no bus, no car,
Work without no bus, no car,
Work without no bus, no car,
Drinking all America,
You want me to drop dead,
But that dead mean got me do a drop head,
Drinking all America,
Want me down, I'm doing town, but it stay yay, I'm with the inner.
Drinking all America,
Lock me up for residue, won't get jobs so fearless so every nigga in my crew.

Drinking all America, land of the thugs,
Land of the dogs, land of the drugs.
Drinking all America, in God we trust and power,
Knock him down to town, get bitches twenty thousands.
Drinking all America, drinking all America.
I pledge allegiance, nigga,
Drinking all America, right in the gut,
Drinking all America.

I pledge allegiance to the block that turned my life around,
Streets been hard as shit for politics, you ain't going down.
Today I pay my taxes so I'm feeling like I took a loss,
Grab a meer hand from that, it, yeah, break 'em off.
Drinking all America, trying to make the Forbes' list,
Label me to democrat, I wanna be republican.
I feel like a palm is summon pressure on a nigga head,
You accidentally shot your home boy, so you're a killer now.
But nigga be killing me, two shots to my enemy,
Always be your down self, never be a wanna-be.
Coming through traffic back to back like a monarchy,
But ain't that right? Is that black in more ways,
Been a presidential in a federal, bitch, I'm J O K,
Run a reggae campaign, shipping in the loudy aye.
I miss to be a clinic, getting head in the other room,
Drinking all America, Yo Gotti fall for some.

Drinking all America, land of the thugs,
Land of the dogs, land of the drugs.
Drinking all America, in God we trust and power,
Knock him down to town, get bitches twenty thousands.
Drinking all America, drinking all America.
I pledge allegiance, nigga,
Drinking all America, right in the gut,
Drinking all America.
