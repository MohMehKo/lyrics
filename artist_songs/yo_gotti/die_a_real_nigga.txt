Yea, Gotti Montana

Real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga
I'mma die a real nigga
I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga,
I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga
I ain't soft on these ho's, I ain't cross on my folk, feds come and scoop me
My mouth staying close, so I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga
I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga

My wrist so froze, my bitch so cold, my trap so set
Got burglar bar doors and I'm ridin around them porches
All base fish, my j's got choices
And every damn college, cause I'm hustling with these vulchers
Bought 10 bricks lost 3, I guess that plate cost me
Got niggas tryna off me, put me in a coffin
Mama am the plug there's some real killas they swimming with the dolphins
Fuck bad bitches often, kush plug in Austin
Serve good candy and I can't tell you what he taught me
But plain ain't simple I'mma die a real nigga
If you pussy's ever push me, I'mma blaw me a nigga!

I'mma die a real nigga
I'mma die a real nigga
I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga,
I ain't soft on these ho's, I ain't cross on my folk, feds come and scoop me
My mouth staying close, so I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga
I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga
I ain't soft on these ho's, I ain't cross on my folk, feds come and scoop me
My mouth staying close

I'm posted in the hood, I'm supposed to be on promo
Neighbour called I ain't answer and I got bricks for the low low
Parrot popped a loco, crime scene gun smoke
Drive by to homicide nigga what you down to die for
These niggas can't be trusted, bitches ain't loyal side bitch ain't getting shit
My main bitch spoiled, I ain't turning up with niggas, we ain't fightin over ho's
Ain't no bitches in my business, got killas on the road
Spoke nigga met em, double wrapped in tape
36 oz all I got is weight, fed them lil gun
Chopper with a drum, bury me a nigga
That day ever come

I'mma die a real nigga
I'mma die a real nigga
I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga,
I ain't soft on these ho's, I ain't cross on my folk, feds come and scoop me
My mouth staying close, so I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga
I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga
I ain't soft on these ho's, I ain't cross on my folk, feds come and scoop me
My mouth staying close

I'mma die a real nigga
I'mma die a real nigga
I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga,
I ain't soft on these ho's, I ain't cross on my folk, feds come and scoop me
My mouth staying close, so I'mma die a real nigga, my mouth staying closed
Mouth stayin closed, my mouth staying closed
I ain't cross my doggs, I ain't selling my soul, can't love you bitches
I don't trust you ho's
