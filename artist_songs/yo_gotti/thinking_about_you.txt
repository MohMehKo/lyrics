Every day I think about you
Lot of days passed
Every day I think about you
Them my niggas
RIP Shawty
Every day I think about you
RIP B.G
I never thought I'd see the shit like this

I got beef with niggas, made me think about you (my niggas)
They ain't ridin' how we used to ride
Too much talkin', no shootin' (shit new)
Lookin' 'round for my real soldiers
Got me thinkin' 'bout you (I don't see 'em)
But now you real hitters dead and gone
You don't even want a crew

First of all I ain't payin' any nigga to ride with me
So you for how you can't slide with me
It's obvious you ain't dyin' with me
I don't need no witness, I don't need no codefendant
Just me and my draco
Yeah just me and my thirty round
Hit your ass up, just me and my yayo
Damn Shawty I miss you
Damn G I miss you
Damn, the game ain't the same
These niggas they softer than tissue
They used to get up with you
But now they all extra and tweet you
When a real nigga stick to the code
They let the internet beat you
Damn

I got beef with niggas, made me think about you (my nigga)
They ain't ridin' how we used to ride
Too much talkin', no shootin' (be quiet)
Lookin' 'round for my real soldiers
Got me thinkin' 'bout you (I'm lookin' around holmes)
But now you real hitters dead and gone
You don't even want a crew (my niggas)
I got beef with niggas, made me think about you (facts)
They ain't ridin' how we used to ride
Too much talkin', no shootin' (shh)
Lookin' 'round for my real soldiers (where they at?)
Got me thinkin' 'bout you
But now you real hitters dead and gone
You don't even want a crew

I just woke up with an issue
I don't even know the issue
Did I take this nigga bag?
Or I did I fuck this nigga bitch?
This a real life problem?
Did I shoot him, did I rob him?
Or he just tryna go viral
Or he just tryna sell some albums
My biggest challenge being a rapper
Is acting like a rapper
All my whole life I was a gangster
My profession was a trapper
They modern day rats, niggas dry snitchin'
On blogs
Real nigga tryna stick to the code
Them laws

I got beef with niggas, made me think about you (I don't even know these niggas)
They ain't ridin' how we used to ride
Too much talkin', no shootin' (them facts)
Lookin' 'round for my real soldiers
Got me thinkin' 'bout you (how you win)
But now you real hitters dead and gone
You don't even want a crew (I ain't tweetin', I ain't postin' shit)
I got beef with niggas, made me think about you
They ain't ridin' how we used to ride
Too much talkin', no shootin'
Lookin' 'round for my real soldiers
Got me thinkin' 'bout you
But now you real hitters dead and gone
You don't even want a crew

Ayy you know what I'm sayin'?
I tell all my young niggas, man don't get caught up in this internet shit
You know what I mean?
Police regular people, you know what I mean? and they fuck bitches, they on Instagram, they on Twitter
They lookin' at your shit, they likin' your shit
Don't be your own witness, holmes
Don't turn your own self in, you know what I mean?
Stay focused
Rrrrrrr
Quiet

I got beef with niggas, made me think about you
They ain't ridin' how we used to ride
Too much talkin', no shootin'
Lookin' 'round for my real soldiers
Got me thinkin' 'bout you
But now you real hitters dead and gone
You don't even want a crew
I got beef with niggas, made me think about you
They ain't ridin' how we used to ride
Too much talkin', no shootin'
Lookin' 'round for my real soldiers
Got me thinkin' 'bout you

You don't even want a crew

Internet, it turn real niggas into cowards
Damn
I'm paranoid lookin' 'round, any nigga move
I'ma down him
