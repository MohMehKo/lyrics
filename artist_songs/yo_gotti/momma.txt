Momma, I don't never want to see you struggle
Tired of seeing me bump heads with my big brother
Momma, that's big bruh, you ain't got to worry
We'll die together, kill together, face a buck and jury
Momma, I'm like a father to my little sister
Gotta make sure she do right, momma, she my baby sister
Momma, I'm just living how you taught a nigga
Said I ain't raising no pussies, I got one daughter, nigga
I remember them Feds came and got a nigga
Asked me where you at and I wouldn't talk to niggas
Momma, living room floor with tears in my eyes hearing them say you gon' be gone for a long time, Momma

Shout out my Auntie Janet she a motherfucker
PeeWee did 10 back out and she still hustling
Erica used to write you letters tell you that she love you
Then we used to drive to visit you up in Kentucky
Like we went from being rich that shit was super ugly
Then my Momma got a job man she selling groceries
Used to have a house in Vegas when we was doing good
And a house behind Elvis now we in the hood
Used to have a Benz now we got a Nissan Sentra
And I can't get a pair of Jordans that's fucking with my mental
I'm just tryna let you visualize what I done been through
And this shit public record nigga you check my credentials
Facts

I switched the family hustle put us back on top
Momma live on 5 acres brother in that drop
Sister she an entrepreneur get her own M's
Feds still watch the family but we don't even see em
I ain't tripping nigga this the art of hustle home
I went from flipping dope to buying houses flipping homes
Momma taught me fuck your losses just keep moving on
If you get caught just never snitch one day you coming home
Momma, gave me the game and for Mother's Day I spent a million and a half for you on Priv√©
And you the owner I'm a worker this shit yours do what you want to you deserve it
Momma

I grew up around hustlers that turned me to a hustler
Was raised by a woman I watched my Momma hustle
I just want to be a kingpin
Teacher asked me what's my Momma she a queenpin
And this my family tradition
I'm just keeping on my family tradition
We built a legacy
And when I grow up I want to be a kingpin
Teacher asked me what's my Momma she a queenpin
