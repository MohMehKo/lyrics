(Well, Ya boy Gotti mane)
She was light bright damn near white with them Chinese eyes and big girl thighs and it was so many rumors and so many lies about my so many girls and so many wives then it broke up my home she left me alone and I was trying to explain to her on the phone but I'm like what is the use of telling the truth cause I was trained as a youth to do what I do so I'd tell her some lies to make her feel good like one day I'm moving you out the hood it went from kisses and hugs to pushes and shoves but that was all a part of fucking with thugs (come on)

If you is down and you'd steal for a nigga (well) stay by his side and you'd kill for a nigga if you fuck with a nigga for real it ain't nothing but keeping it trill If you is down and you'd steal for a nigga (well) stay by his side and you'd kill for a nigga if you fuck with a nigga for real it ain't nothing but keeping it (nothing but keeping it trill)

She just wanted to smile and wanted a child but I was ruinin her dreams by living to wild she said I need to calm down and act like a man and my response was like what the fuck is you sayin cause I was so caught up into moving that white that I was gone 24/7 a night and I didn't give a fuck if I was wrong or was right cause I was a d-boy living a d-boy life she was a school girl slash d-boy wife and it was in with the wrong and out with the right cause she was tracking and manufacturing drugs but that was all a part of fucking with thugs (come on)

We was tighter than banging and cooler than friends we thought it would last forever and never would end and we'd get mad at each other and try to pretend like we was calling it quits wasn't speaking again we went our separate ways for a couple of days you know that separate phases some hell of days like uuh I regret it never doing her friend but it was the need of the moment and you know us men we just think without acting my mind was backtracking but still I say what I mean and I mean I say it's for real so play your position and show me some love cause that was all a part of fucking with thugs (come on)
