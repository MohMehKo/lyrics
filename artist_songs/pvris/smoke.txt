This isn't violence this is just a war in my head,
I give it time but it never seems to end.
I feel a fire in the back of my throat,
So let's get covered in flames and play some games with the smoke.

You said "don't you try to run right now, 'cause baby I could burn you down."

You make your way into my veins,
Course right through my limbs and dig your way into my brain,
So in the second that you walk, walk into a room,
I can't help myself from the things that you do.

Oh, you're killing me right now.
(You're killing me killing me right now)
I think it's time you burn me down.

Oh, I love the things we do when it's just me and you,
I'm burning up, burning up.
Oh, burning up.

(Yeah)

Oh, you're killing me right now.
I think it's time you burn me down.

You're just a ghost of blissful feelings,
A cloud of smoke that I keep breathing,
An illusion, I'm losing you to the games in my mind.
I see your face, an apparition,
But now it's changed,
Shape shifting,
Don't wanna open my eyes.

Oh you're killing me right now.
(The things we do me and you.)
