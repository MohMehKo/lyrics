You give me something to talk about
Something to talk about
Hey!
Hey! Hey!

I know it's chemicals 
That make me cling to you, cling to you
Ooh and I need a miracle 
To get away from you, way from you

I know it's chemicals
(that make me cling to you, cling to you)
and I need a miracle
(to make me stay with you, stay with you)
And I'm not spiritual 
(but please stay)
'Cause I think you're a saint 
And I think you're an angel. 

I said ooh, ooohh
You give me something to talk about
Something to talk about
I said ooh, ooohh
You give me something to think about 
That's not the shit in my head

You're a miracle
You're a miracle
A miracle

Transparent hands 
Were at my neck, at my neck, at my
Ooh but I love the way 
You let me breathe instead, breathe instead

Take in your chemicals
(that make me cling to you, cling to you)
You are a miracle
(I gotta stay with you, stay with you)
And I'm not spiritual
(but please stay)
'Cause you're a glimpse of bliss
A little taste of heaven

I said ooh, ooohh
You give me something to talk about
Something to talk about
I said ooh, ooohh
You give me something to think about 
That's not the shit in my head

You're a miracle
You're a miracle
A miracle

I said ooh, ooohh
You give me something to talk about
Something to talk about
I said ooh, ooohh
You give me something to think about
That's not the shit in my head

I need a miracle 
To bring me back to you, back to you
Ooh I know you're gone now 
But I still wait for you, wait for you

I said ooh, ooohh
You give me something to talk about
Something to talk about
I said ooh, ooohh
You give me something to think about
That's not the shit in my head

You're a miracle
(Hey!)
You're a miracle
A miracle

I still wait, I still wait for you
Ohh I know you're gone now
But I still wait for you, wait for you
