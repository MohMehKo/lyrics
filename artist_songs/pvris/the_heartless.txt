Your doubts of me are constant reminders
Of why I should stop hoping
It's hard to dream with eyes stitched open
I can feel them pull me under
They can take my sights but they can't take me

They pull me under every night
They're always waiting for me and I know it
And they sing together
Put your heart to your eyes and you'll find,
yeah, you'll find, what you're looking for

I can feel them pull me under
Taking my sights but you can't take me

They pull me under every night
They're always waiting for me and I know it
And they sing together
Put your heart to your eyes and you'll find,
yeah, you'll find, what you're looking for

Keep your eyes off the door
And I won't let them pull you under
[x2]

Keep your eyes on me
I won't let them pull you under

Keep your eyes on me

They pull me under every night
They're always waiting for me and I know it
And they sing together
Put your heart to your eyes and you'll find,
yeah, you'll find, what you're looking for
