I think we were cursed from the start
Second I let you into my heart
Do you think we were speaking in tongues
Or simply not enough?
Do you ever wonder
Who took the light from our life?
The light from my eyes?
All we did was suffer
Why couldn't we just say

(You took my heart)
(You took my heart)
You took my heaven away
Away

Our love is pushing out and pulling in
Just like a rising and falling chest that's barely breathing
And didn't you ever wonder
About the dread on my tongue?
The blood in my lungs?
All I did was suffer
I was too afraid to say

(You took my heart)
You took my heaven away
You took my, you took my heaven away
Away
You took my heaven away

You took my, you took my, you took my heaven away
You took my, you took my, you took my heaven away
You took my, you took my, you took my heaven away
You took my, you took my, you took my heaven away

I think we were cursed from the start

You took my
(You took my heart)
(You took my heart)
You took my heaven away
(You took my, you took my, you took my heaven away)
Away
(You took my, you took my, you took my heaven away)
(You took my heart)
(You took my heart)
