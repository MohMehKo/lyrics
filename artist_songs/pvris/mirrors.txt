White lights are too bright.
I just wanna see a trace or an outline.
Say your name into a mirror three times, said it three times, said it three times.
But when you float above my body,
I can see, I can see clearly
Straight through the ceiling, ceiling.

Darling, don't be so shy,
I'll see you at midnight
And when I close my eyes.
I said it three times, I said it three times,
You make my world spin,
Placebo feelings.
And in the morning
I'll wait to see you again.

Your dead eyes before mine.
The way they're missing their whites,
Yeah, they're just right.
I know you're dead inside
And that's what I like, yeah, I like.
But when you float above my body,
Standing up right above me,
I don't feel so lonely, lonely.

Darling, don't be so shy,
I'll see you at midnight
And when I close my eyes.
I said it three times, I said it three times,
You make my world spin,
Placebo feelings.
And in the morning
I'll wait to see you again.

And in the morning I hope I see you by my side,
In the sunlight,
With my own eyes.
And I go searching through reflections for your outline.
But it's just mine.
But it's just mine.

I know you're dead inside,
But you make me feel alive.
I'll wait to see you again.

Darling, don't be so shy,
I'll see you at midnight
And when I close my eyes.
I said it three times, I said it three times,
You make my world spin,
Placebo feelings.
And in the morning
I'll wait to see you again.
I'll wait to see you again.
