You and I.

I know it's warmer where you are
And it's safer by your side
But right now I can't be what you want
Just give it time

And if you and I
Can make it through the night
And if you and I
Can keep our love alive, we'll find

We can meet in the middle
Bodies and souls collide
Dance in the moonlight
When all the stars align
For you and I, for you and I, oh

I know it's cold when we're apart
And I hate to feel this die
But you can't give me what I want
Just give it time

And if you and I
Can make it through the night
And if you and I
Can keep our love alive, we'll find

We can meet in the middle
Bodies and souls collide
Dance in the moonlight
When all the stars align
For you and I, for you and I, oh

But for now we stay so far
'Til our lonely limbs collide
I can't keep you in these arms
So I keep you in my mind

But for now we stay so far
'Til our lonely limbs collide
I can't keep you in these arms
So I keep you in my mind

(Reaching out, canâ€™t feel you now)

Can we meet in the middle?
Bodies and souls collide
Dance in the moonlight
When all the stars align
For you and I, for you and I, oh
