I always liked the drama
I always liked the joke
I always liked the love
And I always liked the smoke
I've never been a poster-child of my days
But I've sent a lot of post cards
And yours is on its way

I traded in my Pong hops for a bar right through my ear
It kind of hurts to sleep on, but pain's not what I fear
I shiver at the prospect of being just one thing
I missed a lot of targets but never lost my aim

I've done a lot of research
I've read a lot of books
I've turned a lot of pages
I've seen some dirty looks
But I can brave the weather
For a chilly glance from you
'Cause somewhere in the distance

The sun is peeking through

I've always been a flower
I've always been a tree
A cabin in the forest
A blanket on the beach
Never in my whole life
Would I choose just one
I've always loved the moonlight
I've always felt the sun

Somewhere in the middle
Of a sunset and a dream
Is the prettiest gardenia
The prettiest gardenia
The prettiest gardenia
That you've ever seen
