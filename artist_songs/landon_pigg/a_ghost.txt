You cannot hug a shadow's neck
You cannot kiss a silhouette
But I've done both
Time and time again

You reel me in like rain on a tin roof
When I open the door to let you in
You are not there, the sky is clear
There's not a cloud in sight

Am I believing in a ghost
Am I wishing on a star
Am I loving you the most
Because I can't be where you are

And am I wishing you were here
'Cause I know you cannot be
Am I going crazy, dear

Your secret eyes, they touch my skin
I wish that I could pretend
But as you know
That really ain't my field

I sit around, looking much too serious
And I stand still, lay in dark period
But all the day will fly away

Am I believing in a ghost
Am I wishing on a star
Am I loving you the most
Because I can't be where you are

And am I wishing you were here
Because I know you cannot be
Am I going crazy, dear
To let you get the best of me

Am I believing in a ghost
Am I wishing on a star
Am I loving you the most
Because I can't be where you are

And am I wishing you were here
'Cause I know you cannot be
Am I going crazy, dear
Am I going crazy, dear
Am I going crazy
To let you get the best of me
