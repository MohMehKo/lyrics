Remember that one night on the town
We were linking arms and skipping around
Singing songs of love, songs of love

You could be my unintended friend
Remember our affection way back when
Way back when

Look at the blue skies gone gray
Another breath without the girl I like
Another disappointing day
Look at the blue skies gone gray

I never knew that cupid felt like this
I'm willing to buy his arrows of loneliness
Loneliness

When my heart broke did you like the sound of it?
You said at least a song will come out of it
That's what you told your mother, didn't you?
Well, this is a song for you

Look at the blue skies gone gray
Another breath without the girl I like
Another disappointing day

Look at the blue skies gone gray
Another breath without the girl I like
Another disappointing day

Yeah, we're doing fine
The worst is almost over
I'm moving on, I don't even know her

Yes, that's the end
We said our last goodbye
I think I'll go home and cry

This is a song for you
This is a song for you
This is a song for you

It's just another day
It's just another day
It's just another day

This is a song for you
This is a song for you
This is a song for you

It's just another day
It's just another day
It's just another day

This is a song for you
This is a song for you
This is a song for you

It's just another day
It's just another day
It's just another day

Blue skies
Just another day
Blue skies
Just another day
