I saw a rubber band stretched 'til the point of breaking
White as a desert flower and dry as a pail of sand
Oh, you look so tired of something
That I don't understand

It's not so wrong to steal if time is all you take
Do you feel like you're losing out on another life?
Slipping through your hands
Oh, you look so tired of something that I don't understand

Still I hope there's hope for you
As you're walking through this desert land
Still I hope there's hope for you
As you're walking through a desert land

I saw a bumblebee steal from a flower only to feed
All her helpless loved ones
But she's the one in need and none can understand
Why she looks so tired of something

Still I hope there's hope for you
As you're walking through this desert land
Still I hope there's hope for you
As you're walking through a desert land

Still I hope there's hope for you
As you're walking this desert land
Still I hope there's hope for you
As you're walking through

Hope for you
As you're walking through a desert land
Still I hope there's hope
