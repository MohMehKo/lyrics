Make a joyful noise
A song that surpasses understanding
A song that speaks to the deaf

Speak to the keys and let the keys speak
And let the keys speak
Speak to the keys and let the keys speak
Just let the keys speak to you

All the way through the night
It will cradle your mind
It fills your head from ear to ear

Speak to the keys and let the keys speak
And let the keys speak
Speak to the keys and let the keys speak
Just let the keys speak

From ear to ear there is no room
From ear to ear there is no room for anything
From ear to ear there is no room for anything but beauty here

Symphonies will fill your dreams
Melodies sing you to sleep

Speak to the keys and let the keys speak
And let the keys speak
Speak to the keys and let the keys speak
Just let the keys speak to you
