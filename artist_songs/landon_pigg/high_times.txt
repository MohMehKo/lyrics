I put a bomb in your fire, you say "Uh oh, uh oh"
I put a bomb in your fire, you say "Uh oh, uh oh"
There is a way to predict the outcome of people like you
You are a sheep in sheep's clothing and you know, you know
I am a'coming to get you, you say "Uh oh, uh oh"
There is a way to predict the outcome of people like you

I open up my gates and you become mine
It's game over in my undertow 
I wish I could explain, but I just ain't got the time
So I'll show ya, watch out now here it goes

Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah
Won't you lower your sword and your shield?
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
I'm gonna show you how submission feels
Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah
Won't you take off your armor for me?
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
I'm gonna show you how to be free

I am the sun spark solar flame and you know, you know
There isn't any place anywhere that you go, you go
That you, you won't feel my flame
And when you try to resist it's like Ha-ha-ha-hot
There is no way around this tell me ho-ho-ho-holy roller, can you feel my flame?

I open up my gates and you become mine
It's game over in my under tow
And I wish I could explain, but I just ain't got the time
So watch out now, here it goes

Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah
Won't you lower your sword and your shield?
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
I'm gonna show you how submission feels
Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah
Won't you take off your armor for me?
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
I'm gonna show you how to be free

I think it's high time for me to give you a kiss
I bet you'd never find a thimble looking like this
I think it's high time for me to give you a kiss
If someone would cover for me well maybe it'da happen before the end of this riff
Cover for me

Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Won't you lower your sword and your shield?
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
I'm gonna show you how submission feels
Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah
Won't you shrug off your armor for me?
Ooh-Ah-Oh-Ah-Oh-Ah-Oh
I'm gonna show you how to be free.
