Clouds do wash o'er the moon so full and plain
The waves do wax o'er the shore and sometimes wane

Peel back the curtain
And join me on the roof

Long white steeples scattered in the green
These rooftop shingles give me room to breathe

Peel back the curtain
And join me on the rooftop of learning
Join me on the roof

Shall we put to rest all the riddles and all of the rhymes?
For nothing is hidden while under the pale moonlight

Join me on
Peel back the curtain
And join me on the rooftop of learning
Join me, join me, join me
Peel back the curtain
And join me on the roof
