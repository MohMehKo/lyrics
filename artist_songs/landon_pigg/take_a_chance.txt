I built my fences too high
Had nowhere to go
No one could get inside
I was alone

I dug my trenches too deep
I couldn’t see the sky
And then a bullet hit me
Then I came alive

Oo I finally found a way
To open up and say
I wanna let you in
I’ve kept you on the outside
Such a very long time

But now I see what I’ve been missin’
All this time I’ve took second guessin’
Now i need…
to take a chance on me

I didn’t wanna be tied down
But now I see
Not being tied down
Ain’t the same as being free
Ooo you set me free

Oo I finally found a way
To open up and say
I wanna let you in
I’ve kept you on the outside
Such a very long time

No man is an island
No point in acting tough
We all need someone to make us smile
To make us cry
To make us love!

I wanna let you in
I’ve kept you on the outside
Such a very long time

Oo I finally found a way
To open up and say
I wanna let you in
I’ve kept you on the outside
Such a very long, long time

And now I see what I’ve been missin’
All this time I’ve took second guessin’
Now I see what I’ve been missin’
All this time I’ve took second guessin’
Now I see
All I need
To take a chance on me.
