You're wonderful 
you're good at everything you do 
Everyone is equal, but not as equal as you 
You're the best 
you're the best 
and every town's got one like you 

Just take trip far away where no one really cares about those things 
and expose yourself to the pleasures and pain of this life 
You can let down your guard to the night 

Paranoid perfectionist people they can only put their very, very best foot forward 
and as a result they're rather easy to detect 
they'll be the only ones hopping down the streets of New York 
and every town's got one like you 

Just take trip far away where no one really cares about those things 
and expose yourself to the pleasures and pain 
if you're walking on the line, you'll never know what's on either side 
You might be wrong or might be right 
You can't pass this up, you gotta give it a try
