Golden leaves looked brown to me,
The world had less color without you
Shapes in the sky, looked plain to my eye,
The world had less color without you

I know pleny' of people with eyes closed
They don't see you like I do
Darling I do

Notes on the keys, meant nothing to me
The world didn't sing without you
Birds in the trees fell silent for me
The world didn't sing without you
Without you

I know pleny' of people with eyes closed
They don't see you like I do
Darling I do, darling I do see you

I know pleny' of people with eyes closed
They don't see you like I
I know pleny' of people with eyes closed
They don't see you like I know

Pleny' of people with eyes closed
They don't see you like I do
Darling I do, darling I do, darling I do,I do,
Darling I do, darling I do, see you
(mmmmmmmmm mmmmmm)
