If I'm saying nothing
Won't you let me speak?
If I'm saying nothing
Won't you let me in?

The truth of what we have is
Blowing through the trees
The wind needs no explaining
Neither do we

Love breathes silence
I love everything about you

Never would I dare to
Break this sacred silence
For luminous is our love
In the peace and quiet

And I can feel your presence
Sitting in the same room
For me it is enough to
Look up and see you

Love breathes silence
I love everything about you

Love, love is forever
Love is forever, say it again
Love is forever, say it again
Love is forever, say it again

Love is forever, say it again
Love is forever, say it again
Love is forever, say it again
Love is forever
