There, there
I don't want to make you cry
There, there
But you'll feel better on the other side
On the other side

You'll never know what's on the inside
If you never open up the box
And why do you expect the door
To open up if you won't even knock

If you're feeling all alone, then
Just look in the mirror at yourself
And you'll remember all the reasons
Why you're sharing your life with no one else

There, there
I don't want to make you cry
There, there
But you'll feel better on the other side
On the other side

There, there
I don't want to make you cry
There, there
There, there

You got a long ways to go
But on the other side
You're gonna find what you're looking for
On the other side
You don't have to hide the tears in your eyes
'Cause on the other side
They're gonna turn into something more
On the other side

You're gonna toss and turn
On the other side
You're gonna find what you're looking for
On the other side
You don't have to hide the tears in your eyes
'Cause on the other side
They're gonna turn into something more
On the other side
