Like a thistle on a tree, like the sparkle on the sea
You were made for glory
And it's no wonder why you're here
For all to see

But like a thorn on my flesh your beauty holds me
I can't find relief
And it's no wonder why you're here
To torture me

Sometimes a man must find relief
In what he can't touch, what he can't see
Maybe he knows that it won't do
But it will do for tonight

And now that you are out of sight
I can only pray that you get out of my mind
But those prayers don't often work for me
You're all I see

Sometimes a man must find relief
In what he can't taste, what he can't see
Maybe he knows that it won't do
But it will do for tonight
Oh, for tonight
Oh, tonight

Like a thorn upon my flesh
Like a thorn upon my flesh
Like a thorn upon my flesh

Sometimes a man must relief
Whatever ways that he can
Maybe he knows that it won't do
But it will do for tonight

Sometimes a man must take the fall
Few other ways will he learn
Just when he's ready to lose it all
Someone comes along

Like a thistle on a tree, like the sparkle on the sea
