Run
Is this to be our fate
Hide
Freedom is ours as long as we escape
We walk in the shadows
We do
Find out what we all know
Our time is near

This is the way it ends
Don't tell me it's meaningless
There'll be no compromise
We fall in we too shall rise
You held me and taught me how 
I think I am ready now
If this is the way it ends
This is the way it's meant to be

We will be spilled in blood
And this is the way that they'll remember us
Emerge from the shadows
We will 
Emerge from the shadows

This is the way it ends
Don't tell me it's meaningless
There'll be no compromise
We fall in we too shall rise
You held me and taught me how 
I think I am ready now
If this is the way it ends
This is the way it's meant to be

Under my skin they fade away
Here's to life with no regrets
See you again all one day
Give me love or give me death
Can anyone ever really say

This is the way it ends
This is my life begins
If this the way it ends
Nothing is meaningless
There'll be no compromise
We fall in we too shall rise again
This is the way it ends
Then this is the way it's meant to be
This is the way it's meant to be
