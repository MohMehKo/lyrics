I see a picture of a family on a desk
And I wonder if the smiles are real
Sometimes I think we're better off than all the rest
How do you feel?

I see her arm around my shoulder and I know
It's a wonder you're even there
And when you smile I know without a doubt
That you really care, you really care

Hold me, hold me, lay me down
I don't even know how it got this far
But all these walls are falling down
And it looks like we made it this far

You always told me that the ears hear the words
But hearts, they can understand
I hope you know what I'm saying when I tell you
I'm trying to be a better man

And if I start to look around when you speak
It's not because I don't care
It's just sometimes I find another angle of your beauty
I have to try not to stare

And hold me, hold me, lay me down
I don't even know how it got this far
But all these walls are falling down
And it looks like we made it

Hold me, hold me, lay me down
I don't even know how it got this far
But all these walls are falling down
And it looks like we made it

And I would be with you
And I wouldn't run away
And I wanna fly you to the moon someday
And it looks like we made it
It looks like we made it this far

And hold me, hold me, lay me down
I don't even know how it got this far
But all these walls are falling down
And it looks like we made it

And hold me, hold me, lay me down
I don't even know how it got this far
But all these walls are falling down
And it looks like, it looks like we made

Looks like
It looks like we made
Looks like, looks like, looks like
