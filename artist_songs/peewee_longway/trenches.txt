No trenches, no trenches, no trenches
No dope [?] on them benches
I don't want [?] design intervention,
I don't, I could [?]
Them trenches are hundreds I feel like a milly
I kick Fred the Godson in a Bentley
The bridge come on bullshit
They're rapping and whipping
Them trenches they're pouring them mud in a kidney
Don't show you no love, don't [?]
And they're busting them slug and ya niggas ripping
They're hood riches [?] they're not rich, they're ripping
They're getting the dope and the water they're spinning
They're talking about deals, it's Venice the deal
I thought molly pill is still [?] to the ceiling
Versaci, Versaci, we brought our women
The trenches are [?]
Young doobie, young shit, and we're rolling, we're sixty
Three quarter [?]
Don't hear [?] them [?] don't get you
I started from scratch with the OG in the trenches
[?] I wasn't getting no business
I stood in the trunk with a [?]
[?] I'm coming, I'm serving the kitchen
The water we're [?] the water we're whipping.

[Hook:]
I start selling drugs in the motherfucking kitchen
I learned how to cook, the water whipping in the trenches
My first hundred thousand, only felt it like a million
Make a neighborhood house and tie them bitches to the kitchen.
The trenches, them trenches
Them trenches, them trenches
Them trenches, in the motherfucking trenches!

I heard your partner had to go for some breads
You gotta get it how we get it living in the trenches
I could have bought a Bentley last we profit out the trenches
Two hundred thousand men, I swear this shit feel like a minute
Get the [?] then I flip it, stretch it in the kitchen
Water wiping, them I'm serving to my little niggas
Yo niggas talk shit, they don't rip or fuck
If you ask my goons in the trenches and a nigga eat you up!
See a nigga got work and a nigga got pussies
Make it double meal while you're grinding in the trenches
See, I'm chilling in the trenches, me and my niggas
I'm a [?] all my niggas!
I will ball all my niggas, go [?] all my niggas
Hundred bag all my niggas
Hundred grands all my niggas
Till it tears down, go hide in the trenches

[Hook:]

The trenches, them trenches
Them trenches, them trenches
Them trenches, in the motherfucking trenches!

Let's go! Two hundred on a day, it's three hundred in the set
They're pulsing my blunt and they fall on my weight
Shit talking nigga get that photo in your face
You know she been a boss, nigga stay in your place, pussy!
I spent like thirty bandz for this watch
So I get like thirty [?]
I felt nothing for these niggas, just the [?]
You ain't working with a mill, I ain't wanna talk!

Hey, touch down, say!
