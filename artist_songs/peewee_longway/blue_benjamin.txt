[Hook:]
I swear my bitch is with the homie with the switcharoo
[?], served the dummy with the switcharoo
Out with the old, in with the new
Still stacking money, I'm a Harlem blue
The blue benjamin [x8]

[Verse 1:]
Handling through the benjamin's
Haters up all on my tips
Sorry we passin' gas
Switcharoo while in the Jag
[?] hefee I got on my tag
All of my bitches like, I dream of Genie
My bitches are bad, suckin' my dick while I'm swervin' the Lamborghini
Switcharoo what's on they ass
200, digital dash
Peruvian cocaine
Hand me the pot and the beater and I'm whippin' cake
And I make, million dollar, sure I spot in the A
Ya'll nigga's sew the strap of an AK
Too cool, [?]
Killin' the image of [?]
My dick is too [?]
Blowing heffer, now they know my name
The blue benjamin, the blue M&M
I'm out there rackin' em' everyday
A different pack comin in from the bay
You little bitty bitch, I'm a dealer
PeeWee [?], you little bitty bitch, I'm a flipper

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I got them ho's on us
New is on the way
Young and road runnin'
Servin' white yay
Bitch bite bay
Guess he might, hey
Ew, I think she likes me, yeah she might, aye
Them blue benjamin, I'm tellin that bitch that I'm gettin' it in, work
Tossin' [?] when the paint come in
Back hand on my Benz, smack [?] I'm a pimp, bitch
Wipe down my Margiela's, fuck her like Kesha
I'm balanced, she young and she ready
Fix that bitch up with the count, hope that bitch [?]
I'm Michael Vick fuckin' with fouls, now I got eagles
[?], very rare
[?] diamond, that make you just stare
, ice, bling bling
In the warm of the summer
I'm on Comcast, I'm on so many channels

[Hook]
