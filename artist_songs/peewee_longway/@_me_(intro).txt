[Verse 1:]
Raised by my momma she don't need my dad
In the trenches like a zoo nigga goin' Jurassic
Breaking it down wrappin' the bales in the plastic
I can show you how to whip it with the waist Mc. Magic
Now they wanna eat it up they say they made dabbin'
Dripping' in Balency's, Givenchy's, Buscemi bag
Mr. Blue Benjamin popping' up like a @
Pocket monster tucked and the 30 piece
Longways there'll never be another Wee
I'm dropping God crack got the jam of the week
I been wrapping backwoods fuck Swisher Sweet
Now they got the whole world on wee
Trapper turned to rapper still trappin' Gas Bags
I can show you how to find me on a hashtag
Google, Yahoo, Searchin', @ Me
Name a nigga that can out trap me (where he at?)
Watch me drop the ticket Jordan 23
A young nigga done been had bobby 23
Split ya damn kneecap off for 10 [?] 3
I'm bagging' fatigue again with them Valentino Chopper
I guess its that time again they gon' Top Shottas
Mr. Blue Benjamin got Blood on the dollar
All my money neat like I'm nigga white collar

Tailor made Dolce Gabanna and head it down from the back
Longways pretty boy floyd
Too much flavor, and None of this shit right here on the video
I really break it down in the studio
OG Gas Bag up in the vacuum seal
5-10-15-20 packs, havin' dabbin' pop it open on stain fax
Damn now a nigga wanna go and @ me
The trapper favorite trapper, trapper nigga
Longways the dapper don originator
Actavis like Kool-aid in the refrigerator
Nigga done pull up and purchase the fraction? huh?

Everybody kitchen they muggin' on nine dimes
Extra out creepin' out they pressin' they tryin'
Mr blue Benjamin stack it up serve it off scale
President Obama done serve what I sell

The only one in the city with jail profit sale
Add it over here nigga add it over there
