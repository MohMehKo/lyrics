I see murders everyday in my hood
I got feinds on the corner
Bust a brick down it smell like ammonia
Mister Serve I'm standing on the corner
I can hook you up if you want it
Ice Cream Man I'll whip up Napoleon
Smoking on the three gram blunts of the sherbert
Tiffany Benjis on my face look like a nerd
A thousand and 8 on both my ears 2 birds
Hop out with that Silk da Shocker at your shirt
I'm a let her do the dirt (do the dirt)
Black and blue coming over with the work
Frank Meuller got the bird flu alert
G-wagon came mounted up with the skirt
Bricks in the hood I'm a show you how to do it
Cooking up, young niggas I was bombs bombs bombs
M.P.A tanks, extendos, all they drums
Tatted my body up like a subway in Harlem
Master p we cut the Frank yard with the carbine
I'll show you how to hit it with the left arm
Drop a deuce bring the gram back stepped on
Gotta be hit me up on the Nextel phone, [?]
Still got cases deals
Trap house still got work for real
You can pull up to the hill and get a personal deal
