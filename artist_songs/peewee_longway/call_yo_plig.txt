[Verse 1 - OGD:]
I'm a trap star, ain't even gotta talk
I got the shit up in yo' hood, it's lookin' like chalk
It ain't my fault if these niggas broke
Actin' like you gettin' money, snitchin' to the foes
I be in a trap house, my door locked tight
I ain't serve no nigga shit 'less it's broad day light
Movin' to the trap, servin' Coors and haze
I ain't talkin' on the telephone, you tryna get jailed?
Nigga I been rich, welcome to my world
Where prices stay the same nigga
If it's boy or girl [x3]
Them prices stay the same nigga welcome to my world

[Hook - OGD:]
Brick Squad came to show you bitches love
Even though I know it ain't no love for a thug
We sellin' drugs, drinkin' syrup without the mud
Don't look at me nigga
Call yo' plug [x3]
Don't look at me nigga
Call yo' plug [x3]
Don't look at me nigga
Call yo' plug

[Verse 2 - Peewee Longway:]
Call yo' plug nigga, talking 'bout y'all got them low-low's
I'm Boston [?] turn the shit low
In a Aston how can I ask?
Me and Double-D from Tennessee
Gettin' them thangs from ten to key
I'm talkin' clean fuckin' fishscale
I'm the plug nigga straight like that
Prices low, can yo' plug beat that?
While you [?] that nigga said?
When the last time you had a pack?
Cause I ain't leaving no room for the OG band
Longway you're the reason why the city be leanin'
Homies all on the hill with them mollys, fuckin' rachet
Boy it ain't no room for yo' plug [?]
[?] push a nigga cap back (Kla! Kla!)
Nigga show me where yo' plug tryna hide there
I need that fuckin' set
[?] pop out where yo' plug at
Double-D you some ill ass nigga from Nebraska
Where'd you get these thugs at?
