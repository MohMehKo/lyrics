[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
I'm rollin' round, juugin P's
I'm a rollin' pharmacist, I'll serve you lean
I'm rollin' round, juugin P's
I'm a rollin' pharmacist, I'll serve you lean

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Okay, it's time for a survey
Little pop quiz test, let's see...
How many mini-me industry lames in the game you know want to dress like me?
Flex like me, tryna get fresh like me?
Do it up in the press like me?
Couple pussycat dolls on my balls
Probably wish their boyfriend was just like me
Seen a bitch last week, keep it G
I'm a come clean, I ain't even fuck her
Heard you a sucker, shits might gleam if I puck her
Sixteen gold teeth I'm a slugger
Roll a 60 if with p fuck with
PeeWee Longway, the longway all day
Shout out to thugga, I'm Straight out the gutter
Nigga sixteen throwing blutter, pretty motha fucka since 16, I ain't sutter
Jeremy Scotts! (Whoo) with the wings! (Whoo Whoo) bernie had the nina in the skinny jeans
Since my early teens, I been sitting clean, mixing, sipping lean
With the leader, up in illy beamers, that's a misdemeanor, fema

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
I'm rollin' round, juugin P's
I'm a rollin' pharmacist, I'll serve you lean
I'm rollin' round, juugin P's

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
I ain't neva seen a nigga like me where he at where he from I'd like to meet him
I'm a rolling stone cookin' with the rolly on 32 shots in my nina
I'm a rolling stone got my rolly pollie on fuck it not Kafima and Katrina
Shots of gas bags in the beamer
Pussy bald head like leukemia
Watch me set it off like Khadijah
Stuffing my cigar with the diesel
Pull up jump off with the Keisha
See you out dea' I need my money-fa
Puerto Rican don't need a visa
Dope white name Mona Lisa
Frank white head shot Tito
Longway not Carlito
Boot up off the molly I don't fuck with the easy hoes
Porsche 9-1-1 got it out the repo
Trap house naw bitch I'm trappin' rollin stizzle
Gas bags I got them bitches going for the lizzo
Fake shot glass and have them J's at the dizzo
I'm runnin them I'm a mob boss calling me Sunny
I'm connected with the pharm-ist got them pints by the hundreds
Whole lot of C notes rubberbandin' my hunnits
Still makin drug deals out the trunk of my Honda
Leanin of a double seal like I'm dumber than dumber
Rollin off a molly pill tryna fuck on your mama

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
I'm rollin' round, juugin P's
I'm a rollin' pharmacist, I'll serve you lean
I'm rollin' round, juugin P's

[Verse 3:]
I'm servin you Xanax to lean the neighborhood pharmacist I'll serve you codeine
My bitch she servin' up P's and buy different bags then go by Saline
She speak different languages but she Portuguese
She drop in the fishes then whip it up in grease
My trap house but her name on the lease
We might get married like Nas and Kelis
My bad I'm trippin' I'm back on my G
Mad black the forgies and SRT8 the jeep
Just got an endorsement from servin' the lean
Thanks to extortion I'm cleaning the streets
Double R Royces I roll them in fleets
My trap house stay rollin' I'm never off beat
I'm baggin up pounds to a new C Note beat
Trapper and rapper still strapped with them hammer
(I make the dope dance like I'm MC Hammer [x2])
Chopin' up pharmists I'm servin you the grammar
And lean I get it from over the counter
Chopin' up pharmists with cameras like Tony Montana
And choppas with clips like bananas

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
