[Verse 1:]
Whole lotta lean in my motherfucking piss
Whole lotta gas in my motherfucking piss
Then a couple gas masks in my motherfuckin' kit
Woke up in a new Bugatti, hungover from molly
Blue Benjamin's all in my pocket runnin' around the fuckin' lobby
She wanna Nikki Minaj, she wannna fuck all my squad
Little bitch go ahead, go hard
Put it on hood, everybody [?]
Fuckin' [?], like Bob Barker
Ya'll nigga fake, got a counterfeit marker
Habitat housing turn him into a trick
[?] break him down on benches
[?] beat him in the face if he snitch
Steaming body up like [?]
Look how that chopper just flip
Universal clip, presidential whip, new with the shit
Pop or die motherfucker
Go 8 mile with that coke
[?]
Pussy boy thought I was butter
All my [?] are making [?]
Cut it like they undercovers
Fuckin' your bitch undercovers
Looking for your bitch, you must love her
Ain't too many bitches I ain't fuck
Punching the pussy, uppercut, beat it up, [?] long way, double up

[Hook:]

Everyday, everyday, everyday
Trappin' with my everyday with my AK
Switcharoo, switcharoo
Switcharoo, Switcharoo
Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
Get a new bitch, switcharoo

[Verse 2:]
All blue my ho's scored
[?] on the bed, trappin' [?]
Four car garage, [?] highway Porsche
Hocus pocus, top aborted
Crank it up, pushing one button
Fuck it on four pockets I need a [?]
I kinda feel like I'm Norbit
[?] Benjamin, poof
Trappin' with my everyday
A house full of AK
OG gas from the bay, I've been gettin' for decades
Everyday I made them birdies fly, hablo my essay

In the kitchen, bring them babies
Everyday, bring your lady
