[Hook x3:]
I gotta win, I gotta win
Either wais, dickie move, I can't lose
I gotta win, I gotta win
(Win win situation, huh?)
I keep it on me, ain't no way you get it

[Verse 1:]
We winnin', we winnin', we winnin', we winnin'
I still got tem chickens like diamonds in windows
Rattle whippin' in the kitchen
Breakin' my wrist bakin' all of those cookies
Baby, I'm far from a rookie
Keep it on me, nigga, sayn me took it
Betta off stalk in the bushes
We winnin', we winnin', we winnin'
I look like a lottery ticket,
D boy bitch look suspicious
Pull up forgery all you huggin' on a koon
Panorama roof, ain't messin'
You ain't lose 'em
Got fifty pair late, came to cruise 'em
You can't win
Got a 100 band riding in the Benz
Spent a 100 band on designer lenses
Ya know I gotta win
Got a 100 bands of OG gassin'
You know I gotta win, can't lose
Win-win situation
I ain't hingin' on a deal, am fuckin' patient
Ten top dawn, you'mma fuck my patience
If it ain't about money, fuck the conversation

[Hook x3:]
I gotta win, I gotta win
Either wais, dickie move, I can't lose
I gotta win, I gotta win
(Win win situation, huh?)
I keep it on me, ain't no way you get it

[Verse 2:]
Million dolla kick, million dolla kick
Now work, dummies, you can't top down
I burned up my skin, I burned up my skin
I stay by drink, but I put up on the
Down girls, spread yo guapo shit on yo head
It's a game! You can't have that kind o'paper
Get down, I touch skyscraper, nigga
The Benjamins, The Benjamins, I rob a camera when I get [?]
That cannot count, ten plus ten, I need twenty
Hop hop hop, wait, nigga, that twenty in
Even though it's sick, I'm tryna fuck all her friends
Free reverse give 'em ten but I'm still reppin' tryna win

[Hook x3:]
I gotta win, I gotta win
Either wais, dickie move, I can't lose
I gotta win, I gotta win
(Win win situation, huh?)
I keep it on me, ain't no way you get it
