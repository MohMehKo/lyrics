Holla at my bitch if I still catchin bodies

I keep the food like I'm shoppin with Tropicana
Trappin hella trapaholic choppaholic,

They callin me John Dillinger a Rambo
You actin like Sosa they move when I say so
On my command they let the AK go
Dressed in Cavalli, cruising in a Ghost
Fingerin sassy motherfucker doin the move
Tell him get bricks on the boat
Damn I just hit him with 2 antidotes
Damn I just hit him with 2 and I go

Chest in the sun and do when I get pulled
Pourin and pourin, pourin and pourin
Sippin and spinnin, fucked up my Cavalli

Entertaining yo bitch like I'm Cedric

Somebody call the paramedics
Bend a hoe over like Teddy
Piss on your bitch like R Kelly

Lunatic nigga, but I am no Nelly

Draw the fever whippin white Katy
Cold diamonds in the frigerator
