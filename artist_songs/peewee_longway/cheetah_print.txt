[Hook:]
I'm a million dollar nigga out drug dealin'
One button, and the coupe do away with the cieling
All these bitches wanna fuck on a thug
Fly as a bitch on a latin rug
Got these bitch nigga's, caught in the feelings
Cheetah van looking for your bitch
Cheetah van looking for your bitch
Ain't too many bitches that a nigga ain't hit
European tailor made fit, European tailor made fit
Fly as a bitch on a latin rug
European tailor made kicks

[Verse 1:]
European tailor made whip
Swervin' the bitch from the passenger side
Playin' with the bandz that flipped
Tailor made european cut
Leave out the club, everytime she scream butt
Get jumped by three sluts
Butt, butt, butt
Gotta cheetah van lookin' for your bitch
She on molly, goin' up want to switcharoo the homie says what up
[?]
Sneakin' and geakin' a trip off to nasa
One eye watchin' the brick like I'm slick rick
Blue benjamins in my pocket like sweet lick
Fuck around and get your ass hit
With the hit stick, like the replay on John Madden
Slummed out millionaire, young nigga have it
Billionaire boy club clothes on just dabbing longway, [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Ain't too many bitches that a nigga ain't hit
Cruisin' the Jag like I'm laden on the rug
Fortunetlly I'm on the low, three piece
In the back seat, three peice, white meat
Pants swaggin', bitch can't bite me
[?] to spite me
None of these bitches can't bite me
Feel like a young nigga Mike
Thriller, my fuckin' [?]
Look at you, goin' and pick the jury
Slummed out millionaire, treckin' in Missouri
Cocaine purer then pure [?] calling them tourist
[?] hard top, soft top
Bought it from a million dollar jugge longway

[Hook]
