Long goes the night
Longer the day
Teclo your death
Will send me to my grave

I learn to beg
I learn to pray
Send me his love
Send him to me again

Let me ride
Let me ride
Let me ride on his grace for a while

Let me ride
Let me ride
Just let me ride on his grace for a while
Hmm

Long goes the night
Longer the day
Teclo your death
Will send me to my grave

Let me ride
Let me ride
Just let me ride on his grace for a while

Let me ride
Let me ride
Just let me ride on your grace for a while

Just let me ride
