Hunter the associator
He crashes high
Shakes the disbeliever
Woof woof
Shakes the disbeliever's head
Shakes him harder, instructing you well
Woof woof
Woof woof
Woof woof
Woof woof

Hear me you healer,
Your rubbish inside your rotting mind
Woof woof
I am your guardian
I am your fairy, do my will
Woof woof
Woof woof 
Woof woof
Woof woof

Shit lovers, this is true love 
That we're doing now
Your lover that was before, all broken
Your face all messed up
Woof woof
Woof woof 
Woof woof

I will not
I will not
I will not
I will not
I will not
I will not 
I will not 
I will not
I will not
