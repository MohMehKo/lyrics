I think I saw you in the shadows 
I move in closer beneath your windows 
Who would suspect me of this rapture? 

And who but my black hearted love 
And who but my black hearted love 

When you call out my name in rapture 
I volunteer my soul for murder 
I wish this moment here forever 

And you are my black hearted love 
And you are my black hearted love 
In the rain, in the evening I will come again 

I'd like to take you; 
I'd like to take you to a place I know 
My black hearted 
I'd like to take you; 
I'd like to take you to a place I know 
My black hearted 
I'd like to take you; 
I'd like to take you to a place I know 
My black hearted 
I'd like to take you; 
I'd like to take you to a place I know 
My black hearted
