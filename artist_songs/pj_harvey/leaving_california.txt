California, leaving
California
California, leaving
California

No one but me is walking
Under palms that give no shade
I'm leaving you today

California leaves me
California
California leaves me
California

How cruel was I to think that
I could make you change?
Oh, give me some shade
Oh, England come soon
How could I believe that I
Could live and breathe in you?

California killed her
California
California killed me
California

I think it's time to leave
I think it's time to leave
I told no one I'd stay
I think it's time to leave
