Where, where have you gone?
Daniel, my only son
I, I even slept with you
To be here in your chair
Sitting in your favourite chair

When you snuck into the water
I felt you leave through one thousand
Yawning miles
My heart slowed, my heart slowed
Never to pick up again

Pieces, pieces of my life
Are gone
Washed away in water that took
My son
