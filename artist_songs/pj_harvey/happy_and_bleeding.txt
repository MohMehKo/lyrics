she burst  dropped off  picked the fruit  and realize  i'm naked too  so cover my body  dress it fine  hide my  linen and lace  been sewing ever since time began

but more than the hills  more than the trees  more than the mountains-you  more than i can see  in front of me  more than the mountains-you
-fruit flower myself inside-out  i'm happy and bleeding for you  fruit flower myself inside-out  i'm tired and i'm bleeding for you

this fruit was bruised  dropped off and blue  out of season  happy and bleeding  long overdue  too early and it's late too  mind and body  i would and i would not do
- fruit flower myself....
fig fruit flower myself inside-out for you
