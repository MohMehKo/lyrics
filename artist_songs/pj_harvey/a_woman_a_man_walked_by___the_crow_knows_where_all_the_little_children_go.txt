I went to you, a woman-man
A courageous friend, I thought
But turned out so wrong was I 
When we were up against the wall

He had chicken-liver balls
He had chicken-liver spleen
He had chicken-liver heart 
Made of chicken-liver parts
Lily-livered little parts
Lily-livered little parts

Prematurely going bald 
Any passion long gone cold
But I wanted to explore the 
Damp alley ways of his soul
All the times he tried to help
He spit in my face and laughed
That woman-man, I want his fucking ass
I want his fucking ass
I want your fucking ass

My friend-itey, he's looking likey
Crammed in a taxi, I see you too clearly
Suckin' on a little pea, suckin' on a little pea
My my, a little toy
He's just a mommy's boy
Where's your liver, where's your heart?
Where's all your woman parts?
Now it's my turn to laugh

You stick it up your fuckin' ass
You stick it up your fuckin' ass
You stick it up your fuckin' ass
You stick it up your fuckin' ass
