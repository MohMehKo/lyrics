I imagine a dream
In which I'm a soldier
And I'm walking
On the faces 
Of dead women
And everyone I've 
Left behind me

The troops entered
The thirty-ninth
Thirty-ninth parallel

Send me home restless
Send me home damaged
And wanting

It's the year when
Some poet said
"We must live, or accept the 
Consequences"
I want you to share 
Every pinprick of guilt 
That I have felt
That I have felt

Send me home restless
Send me home damaged
Send me home disposes
Send me home damaged
And wanting
