Oh you're divine
Oh you're divine
Oh Oh Oh did I tell you you're divine
Oh Oh Oh Oh did I ever when you were alive

Did it hurt when you bled?
Did it, oh lover boy, oh fever head?
I'll bet you never thought I'd try
Your mouth, my love, was open wide

Singing oh you were going to be my life
Dammit!
Oh Oh Oh Oh you were going to be my life

Did you sing "Oh happy day"?
Singing it
Sing it that time I went away?
Got to ease my aching head
Do you know
No other way cut off your legs oh
Hey oh

Did you ever wish me dead
Oh lover boy, oh fever head?
No you must, no you must not go away
How will you ever walk again?
And I, I might as well be dead
But I could kill you instead...
