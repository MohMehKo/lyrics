Dear darkness
Dear darkness
Won't you cover, cover
Me again?

Dear darkness
Dear
I've been your friend
For many years

Won't you do this for me?
Dearest darkness
And cover me from the sun

And the words tightening
The words are tightening
Around my throat

And, and...

Around the throat of the one I love
Tightening, tightening, tightening
Around the throat of the one I love
Tightening, tightening, tightening

Dear darkness
Dear darkness
Now it's your time to look after us
'Cause we kept you clothed
We kept in business
When everyone else was having good luck

So now it's your time
Time to pay
To pay me and the one I love
With the worldly goods you've stashed away
With all the things you
Took from us
