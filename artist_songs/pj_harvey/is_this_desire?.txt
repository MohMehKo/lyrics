Joseph walked on and on the sunset
Went down and down coldness
Cooled their desire and Dawn said
"Let's build a fire"

The sun dressed the trees in green
And Joe said
"Dawn I feel like a king"
And Dawn's neck and her feet were bare
Sweetness in her golden hair

Said "I'm not scared" 
Turned to her and smiled
Secrets in his eyes
Sweetness of desire

Is this desire, enough enough
To lift us higher, to lift above ?

Hour long
By hour, may we two stand
When we're dead, between these lands
The sun set behind his eyes
And Joe said : "Is this desire"

Is this desire, enough enough
To lift us higher, to lift above ?

Is this desire, enough enough
Enough inside, is this desire ?
