April, how could
I not have seen
April, you coming
April how could I've
Worn inappropriate clothing?
April, all that careful stepping,
Rounding of my soul
And now your rain
April, I feel you leaving

I don't know what silence means
It could mean anything

April, won't you answer me?
These days just seem to crush me
Hatching, collapsing, tumbling down
April, what if I drown?
I drown?

April, I see you leaving
I don't know what silence means
It could mean anything

I dream
I dream

April, April
Did I want you?
Did I want change?

April, your rain overcomes me
