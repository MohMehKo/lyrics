Look out ahead
I see danger come 
I wanna' pistol 
I wanna' gun 
I'm scared baby 
I wanna' run 
This world's crazy 
Give me the gun 

Baby, baby 
Ain't it true 
I'm immortal 
When I'm with you 
But I wanna' pistol 
In my hand 
I wanna' go to 
A different land 

I met a man 
He told me straight 
'You gotta' leave 
It's getting late' 
Too many cops 
Too many guns 
All trying to do something 
No-one else has done

Baby, baby...

I walk on concrete 
I walk on sand 
But I can't find 
A safe place to stand 
I'm scared baby 
I wanna' run 
This world's crazy 
Gimme' the gun

Baby, baby
