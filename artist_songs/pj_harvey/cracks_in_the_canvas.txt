Had do we cope
With the days after a death?
Empty days, nothing left
Not even a funeral

I see shapes falling inside
Paintings
Animals and humans, row upon row
Walking toward something
Waiting for something

I'm looking for an answer,
Me and a million others
Disbelievers
Deserted lovers
Dear God, 
You better not let me down this time

Cracks in the canvas
Look like roads
That never end
