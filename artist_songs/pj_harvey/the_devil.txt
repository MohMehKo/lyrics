As soon as I'm left alone
The devil wanders into my soul

And I pretend to myself
And I pretend to myself

I go out
To the old milestone
Insanely expecting
You to come there
Knowing that I wait for you there
That I wait for you there

Come!
Come!
Come here at once
Come!
Come
On a night with no moon

Because all of my being is now in pining
All of my being is now in pining

What formerly had cheered me
Now seems
Insignificant
Insignificant
