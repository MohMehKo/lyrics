I can't believe life's so complex 
When I just wanna' sit here and watch you undress 
This is love that I'm feeling 
Does it have to be a life full of dread? 
I wanna' chase you round the table, I wanna' touch your head 
This is love that I'm feeling 
I can't believe that the axis turns on suffering 
When you taste so good 
I can't believe that the axis turns on suffering 
While my head burns 
This is love that I'm feeling 
Even in the summer, even in the spring 
You can never get too much of a wonderful thing

You're the only story that I never told 
You're my dirty little secret, wanna' keep you so 
Come on out, come on over, help me forget 
Keep the walls from falling on me, tumbling in
- This is love that I'm feeling
