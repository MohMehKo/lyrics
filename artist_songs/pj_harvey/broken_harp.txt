Please don't reproach me
For, for how empty
My life has become

I don't what really happened
I watched your disappointment
At being misunderstood

I forgive you

Oh
Something metal
Tearing my stomach out
If you think ill of me

Can you
Can you
Forgive me
Forgive me
Can you
Can you
Forgive me
Too

Too

I tried to learn your language
But fell asleep half undressed
Unrecognizable to myself
