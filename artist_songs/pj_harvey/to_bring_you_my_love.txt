I was born in the desert
I been down for years
Jesus, come closer
I think my time is near

And I've traveled over
Dry earth and floods
Hell and high water
To bring you my love

Climbed over mountains
Travelled the sea
Cast down off heaven
Cast down on my knees
I've laid with the devil
Cursed god above
Forsaken heaven
To bring you my love

To bring you my love
To bring you my love
To bring you my love

I know he's gonna be here
He know he's gonna be here
Yeah alright

Forsaken heaven
Cursed god above
Lay with the devil
Bring you my love

To bring you my love
To bring you my love
To bring you my love
