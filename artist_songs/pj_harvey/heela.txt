[P J Harvey :]

I was lost in love
I was lost inside
'Till he said to me
You've got a lovely smile

And i'm saved
Saved
And I'm saved
And I'm saved

Heal me with his hands
Heal me with his heart
When he said to me
No no we never part

[P J Harvey :] Heal me with his hands
[J. Parish :] Well she feels though she had my paradise
[P J Harvey :] Heal with his heart
[J. Parish :] She was a hula girl, she got her hair done nice
[P J Harvey :] When he said to me
[J. Parish :] She said "i'll give it all I got to my heela man
[P J Harvey :] No no we never part
[J. Parish :] He put his hands on me, showed me what I am"

[P J Harvey, J. Parish :] And I'm saved

When I got that heela by my side
And I push him daylight, push him night

[Repeat 'till the end]
