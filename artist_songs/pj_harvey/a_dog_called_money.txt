The kids, they're rolling dice for change
Sitting on the backyard steps
Calling Money's name
Old guy walking to the store
Chewing on a cocktail stick
Starts to tell us what is what

He says
"Everything is staged
That's how it is
People are just paid to work
And I'm tired of it
What you gonna do to change it?
Everything is staged
That's what's going on"

The kids rolling dice again
The sun is beating down
I asked the old guy's name
He smiles
The people runs our way
The kids call out for him
"Money, money"

He says
"Everything is staged
That's how it is
People are just paid to work
And I'm tired of it
What you gonna do to change it?
It's all about money
That's what's going on"
