She lay
Breathing
Sunshine
Beating
Time here
Lingers
Trace with
My fingers
A circle
A circle
'Round the sun
The sun, the sun, the sun

No more
Laughter
Since the
Black come
But head down
Get high
Up there's
Blue sky

And a circle, a circle
'Round the sun
The sun, the sun, the sun

Time here
Lingers
Can trace with
My fingers

A circle, a circle
'Round the sun
The sun, the sun, the sun
