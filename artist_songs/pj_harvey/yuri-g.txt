Hey there Luna 
I'd like to tell ya
How sad am I 
So love sick I could die

Needing water 
My neck's stiff, my head hurts
Been looking up all night
Been looking at the Moon, she's so bright

She's so white 
She's so clean
I'm telling you 
She's everything
I'd give it all 
My sorry eyes
Give just everything 
She's got me so mesmerized

Yeah I wish I was Yuri-G
It's just the things that she does to me
Yeah I wish I was Yuri-G
Give back my memory

Told by a doctor, 
"You make her figure
Needles stick in her 
She'll be your Luna"

I stuck them in real clean
I stuck them in a mile
I drew her down on me
I drew her with a smile
I'd give it all you see
I'd give my sorry eyes
I'd give just everything 
She's got me so mesmerized

Yeah I wish I was Yuri-G
It's just the things that she does to me
Yeah I thought I was Yuri-G
Give back my memory

I stuck them in a mile
I stuck them in real clean
I stuck them in a mile
I drew her down on me
I drew her with a smile
I'd give it all you see
I'd give my sorry eyes
I'd give just everything 
She's got me so mesmerized

Yeah I wish I was Yuri-G
It's just the things that she does to me
Yeah I thought I was Yuri-G
Give back my memory

Yeah I wish I was Yuri-G
I let her walk all over me
Yeah I thought I was Yuri-G
Give back my memory [X3]
