Erica, Erica
Is watching
Danielle, Danielle
Is hiding
Erica, Erica
Is counting

Sixteen, fifteen, fourteen
Twelve, eleven, ten, nine

Erica, Erica
Is counting
Sun is setting, see
In the garden it's starting to rain
The trees are trembling
Erica's repeating

Erica, there is no laughter in the garden [repeat]

Erica is feeling something
Danielle is hiding
She's counting

Sixteen, fifteen, fourteen, 
Thirteen, twelve, eleven, ten, 
Nine, eight

Sun is leaving the scene 
Took a look and turning away
The trees are trembling
Erica's repeating

Erica, there is no laughter in the garden [repeat]
