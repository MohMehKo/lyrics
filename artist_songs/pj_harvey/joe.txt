joe ain't you my buddy thee?
stay with me when i fall and die
always thought you'd come rushing in
to clear the shit out of my eye

joe ain't you my buddy thee?
lay my enemies out in lines
come in close and i'll wash your feet
with my hair i'd mop them dry  
joe you be my buddy please
in this (hell) and (dead-lock) time
when i'm trussed in that headache tree
cut me down with your
knife
