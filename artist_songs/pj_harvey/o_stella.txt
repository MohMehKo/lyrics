o stella maris you're my star  stand on ground look up at her  just hanging in the gold stones  just hanging there face froze

but i think i see her smiling
gold
o stella maris you're my star  in your blue blue tavern you light my lantern  o stella's large  pink on her face glowing this place
a place for heroes only
gold
o stella maris you're my star  pin you to my chest  sell you to the rest  wish as  i kiss her gown  send those angels down to woo me now 				i think i see her smiling	
gold
