Let's Talk 
Let's talk 
Let the dirt fall 
Let Heads Roll 

No kind hand is reaching out for me tonight 
I slept facing the wall 
I dreamt of buildings in pieces 
You slept facing the wall 
and you wanted less than I wanted 

Passionless, Pointless. 
Where does the passion go? I'm asking 
There's no kindness in your hands 
No reaching out for me tonight 

You slept facing the wall 
and you wanted less than I wanted 
I slept facing the wall 
but when I met you how did you enter? 
I don't remember 
How did we ever?
