I think I wrote this poem for you
And I don't know what I'm trying
But everything I'm saying is true
I know you've heard it all before like nothing is new
Let's just not twist on the familiar

Say something
No, no, no, you ain't got to say nothing, no
Your body's speaking loud and clear to me
Just keep on talking baby
Don't say shit
Just keep on talking baby
Don't say shit

You never got to read what I wrote
But I know you know when I'm saying every sentence in quote
I'm a speed it up before you tell me that I'm going to take it slower
It's just to show you how much I feel your heart

Say something
No, no, no, don't say nothing, no
Your body's speaking loud and clear to me
Just keep on talking baby
Don't say shit
Just keep on talking baby
Don't say shit

You ain't got to say no words, say no words
[?]
Say shit
Don't say shit
Don't say shit
