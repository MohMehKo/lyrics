[Verse 1:]
You ever been in the dark
Waiting for your day to start
And you just wanna see the light
Feel like you in jail for life
You acting like a damn CO
Why you don't love me no more
What did I do to get this death sentence

[Bridge:]
I'm getting out today
Never your looking your way
Baby I promise, from my thoughts you are the farthest away
I don't need to forget ya
I'm not gon regret ya, no
Just act like I never met ya

[Hook:]
You're an after thought
Baby, you're an after thought
You're an after thought
Baby, you're an after thought

[Verse 2:]
You ever put a car in park
Step down on the gas
The engine just roars and roars
The car doesn't move at all
That's what out love is like
Remind me again why do we fight
When winning is a losing cause
We both end up with scars

[Bridge:]
I'm getting out today
Never your looking your way
Baby I promise, from my thoughts you are the farthest away
I don't need to forget ya
I'm not gon regret ya, no
Just act like I never met ya

[Hook:]
You're an after thought
Baby, you're an after thought
You're an after thought
Baby, you're an after thought
You're an after thought
After thought, yeah

[Outro:]
I said, said
I can say much more
But it wouldn't make sense
Cause you're not here no more
Cause you're an after thought
