I don't wanna watch
I don't wanna worry 'bout you walkin' out my door
I don't wanna wake up late anticipatin' your call
Don't waste a moment without you all in my mind
Want this whenever your body

You give me love, girl
You give me love in a blacked out world

Girl, I don't want you to leave
Not as long as I'm breathin'

I just want ya love
I just want ya love
I just want ya love
I just want ya love

So who's keeping score?
We go back and forth so much you give anymore
We walk in and out, of loves revolving door
But you're too caught up in it to see that we're just chasin' each other endlessly

You give me love
You give me love
You give me love
You give me love

Girl, I don't want you leaving
Not as long as I'm breathing

I just want ya love
I just want ya love
I just want ya love
I just want ya love

I just want ya love
I just want ya love
I just want ya love
I just want ya love
