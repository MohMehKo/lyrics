My heart don't want to believe
That after all this, girl you will do this to me!
But I was so blind not to see,
I don't have what you want,
But could it be what you need?
Hey, gave this love thing a chance,
I'm putting my all, cause I ain't want no one else
But now I clearly can see
You did what love gonna do, just wanna be seen
You used me, girl!

[Chorus:]
Oh, all it sees my chain and a fancy face,
Girl, you only love the fame
Everything that I bring
Cause you play me baby, only love my fame
All it sees my chain and a fancy face,
Girl, you only love the fame
Everything that I bring
Cause you play me baby, only love my fame

I put my heart in your hand,
You played with my mind
Made me the less of a man.
[?] could I ever be
[?] you took it from me, hey!
I gave this love thing a chance
I put in my all, cause I ain't want no one else!
But now I clearly can see
You did what love girl, you just wanna be seen
You used me, girl!

[Chorus:]
Oh, all it sees my chain and a fancy face,
Girl, you only love the fame
Everything that I bring
Cause you play me baby, only love my fame
All it sees my chain and a fancy face,
Girl, you only love the fame
Everything that I bring
Cause you play me baby, only love my fame

I gave this love thing a chance
I put in my all, cause I don't want no one else!
But now I clearly can see
You did what love girl, you just wanna be seen
You used me, girl!
