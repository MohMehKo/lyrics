You say you're the thing, just something that you give away
Someday you won't get, you won't let me do the same
You just wait the day before that things change
Others had their chance but now it's you and I, alone

Come now, it's just you and I alone
Come now, it's just you and I alone
Come now, it's just you and I alone
Girl, just you and I alone
Come now, it's just you and I alone
Come now, it's just you and I alone
Come now, it's just you and I alone

Girl, I'm at the speaker
Much obliged to bring your past into your present
Don't fuck around unless I get a future
Know what I mean? Yeah
Yea, just you and I alone now
It's you and I alone
What it's gonna be
