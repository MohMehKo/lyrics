Your face, your hair,
Your could just stand still and take me there!
Your weekend friend
The road can be endless once we begin,
Cause baby, you're so beautiful
I pace myself, can you blame me?
I must be good, cause when you taste yourself,
I don't blame you, girl
And I got a homie telling me everything
How freaking you are
Sure a nigga need that thing, my life!

[Chorus:]
Cause I heard your love is so amazing, amazing
Nothing I rather do except for staying late
I can spend every night with you
It's so amazing, amazing, amazing
Trust that I can do you like crazy, crazy
Just tell me where you're staying
And I can make you say
Make you say, "come, give it to me!"
Make you say, "come, give it to me, oh girl!"

My lips all over yours
But it's just me that's kissing you
Oh no, goose bumps,
That's just the first thing that I would do
You just do something to me
My feeling in this world can explain

You're so beautiful
I pace myself, can you blame me?
I must be good, cause when you taste yourself,
I don't blame you, girl
And I got a homie telling me everything
How freaking you are
Sure a nigga need that thing, my life!

[Chorus: x2]
Cause I heard your love is so amazing, amazing
Nothing I rather do except for staying late
I can spend every night with you
It's so amazing, amazing, amazing
Trust that I can do you like crazy, crazy
Just tell me where you're staying
And I can make you say
Make you say, "come, give it to me!"
Make you say, "come, give it to me, oh girl!"
Cause I heard your love is so amazing, amazing
Nothing I rather do except for staying late
I can spend every night with you
It's so amazing, amazing, amazing
Trust that I can do you like crazy, crazy
Just tell me where you're staying
And I can make you say
Make you say, "come, give it to me!"
(Would you give it to me?)
Make you say, "come, give it to me!"
Make you say, "come, give it to me!"
Make you say, "come, give it to me!"
(So would you give it to me?
Would you give it to me?)
