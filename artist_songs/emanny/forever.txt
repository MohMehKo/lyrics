Usually don't know what you got 'til it's missing
Heard that so many times I' starting not to listen
But now, I know that you're done, I fucked up, I lost one
You think I don't care, come home and I swear
You won't cry no more, I can't lie nooooo
You won't cry no more, I can't lie nooooo

[Hook:]
It took me forever to notice
You wouldn't let me down
It took me forever, I know this
Cause you're leaving me now
It took me forever
(To get it, get it - but I got it, got it - just know that I don't want live without it)
It took me forever
(To get it, get it - but I got it, got it - just know that I don't want live without it)
It took me forever
(To get it, get it - but I got it, got it - just know that I don't want live without it)
It took me forever
(To get it, get it - but I got it, got it - just know that I don't want live without it)

If you should lose love, and it comes back to find you
Hold on to it tight, put the past behind you
But I, can't take the uncertainty
I need you right here, with me
You think I don't care, come home and I swear
You won't cry no more, I can't lie nooooo
