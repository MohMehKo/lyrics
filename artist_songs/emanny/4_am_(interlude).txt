Say
In the beginning it's just that easy
But then you came along and messed up my world
I gave you love, you gave me hurt
I know I should stop, gotta make this end
But I still want more, this 4 AM
This 4 AM

She just wanna leave befo-before the sun comes up
She just she just want that 4 AM
She just she just want that 4 AM
She don't wanna wake you and the neighbors with sayin' she walk away
Clutching a water bottle
She just she just want that 4 AM
She just she just want that 4 AM

I want that want that 4 AM
Love, step one, it's 4 AM
It's 4 AM
