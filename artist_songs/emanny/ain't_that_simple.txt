In the beginning you were my best friend
We were cooling on, now we're often on
Now I'm feeling like you're changing on me
What I've been, were we go wrong?

Now we're falling together
Now we're falling apart cause
It ain't like you once was,
Acted on impulse.
Compliments turn to insults
You think it's your fault
And I know what it feels
But it ain't what you wanted

[Chorus:]
And the promises (the promises)
I'm over my head, oh, oh
Those empty promises
No, you gotta think in
I have my fingers crossing
But it ain't simple, baby
It ain't that simple, baby!
But it ain't simple, baby
But it ain't simple, baby

Now we're falling together
Now we're falling apart cause
It ain't like you once was,
Acted on impulse.
Compliments turn to insults
You think it's your fault
And I know what it feels
But it ain't what you wanted

[Chorus:]
And the promises (the promises)
I'm over my head, oh, oh
Those empty promises
No, you gotta think in
I have my fingers crossing
But it ain't simple, baby
It ain't that simple, baby!
But it ain't simple, baby
But it ain't simple, baby
But it ain't simple, baby
But it ain't simple, baby
But it ain't simple, baby
But it ain't simple, baby
