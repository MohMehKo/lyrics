Fall back on the beat

Her name appears in my call log often
Shouldn't even be fuckin' this girl but I lost it
Had a problem trustin' 'til I touched it
Now she dust it and go
As the sun comes up and these curtains unfold
And I'm all fucked up cause this gold wrapper ain't left my pocket
Tickled at first, expecting you to say stop it
But you didn't, so I'm with it
And we did it, and now I'm wakin' up wishin' I didn't pull out, wow

It's the morning after
Ain't too much for me to say so I turn away
It's the morning after
Looking over at your face
Girl I can't believe it's the morning after

Her effects in me are depthening
Defining every moment would be simple but
I'm restricted, I'm conflicted
I dismiss it, then I'm right back into the game
Man, this girl's a saint and a vixen
Last night I learned a lesson and this morning I'm being tested on it
She young and ready and fucking her professor, homie
But I don't wanna know lesser
First came about the service and then came us
So you know I tear that down before the sun came up
And in her mind she probly thinkin' she came up
When a R&B nigga like I, like I ain't seen shit before
I know I messed but I want more, wake up

It's the morning after
Ain't too much for me to say so I turn away
It's the morning after
Looking over at your face
Girl I can't believe it's the morning after

It's the morning after
It's the morning after
It's the morning after
