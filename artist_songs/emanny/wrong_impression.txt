[Verse 1: Emanny]
You got me fucked up, I ain't trying to buy you, no
You got me drunked up off your body 'cause your body's like a bottle
You got me staring, bass banging, lights is blaring
You and your bestie caress me, I know you like sharing
Oh, when I get you out this club
Oh, when I get you out your clothes
Oh, when I get you in front that mirror, we ain't gotta rush
'Cause you can slow it down, don't wanna leave the wrong impression

[Hook: Emanny]
You got me fucked up, you got me fucked up
You got me fucked up, you got me fucked up

[Verse 2: Emanny]
You got me fucked up, I ain't got a lot too, no, no
You must be hung up off your last, it's the past so just leave him where he at
You got me cuffed up only for the last few songs
You must be fucked up like I can't get you home
Oh, when I get you out this club (when I get you out this club)
Oh, when I get you out your clothes (your clothes, your clothes your clothes)
Oh, when I get you in front that mirror, you ain't gotta rush
'Cause you can slow it down, don't wanna leave the wrong impression

[Hook: Emanny]
You got me fucked up, you got me fucked up baby
You got me fucked up, you got me fucked up

[Verse 3: Emilio Rojas]
Baby, don't get it twisted, just 'cause I want it don't mean I miss it
I know the only thing you scared of is commitment
So we gon' do this thing different
You the one I get with when I need to get a lick
And I'm the one you call when you need to get a dick
But I don't need it all, I just want a little bit
And when we done with it, we be back up on our shit
And that's the shit I like and that's the shit you like too
Shit, that's probably why I like you
Now I don't sit here and say just what I might do
Because actions speak louder and I lack proof
I got a condom and baby, you the night's piece
If it's raw, then maybe you my wifey
You don't gotta love me, you just gotta like me
But don't be leaving any marks girl 'cause you got me fucked up

[Hook: Emanny]
You got me fucked up, you got me fucked up baby
You got me fucked up, you got me fucked up

You got me fucked me fucked up
You got me fucked me fucked up
You got me fucked me fucked up
Oh, when I get you out this club
