Liberian girl
You came and you changed my world
A love so brand new
Liberian girl
You came and you changed me girl
A feeling so true

Liberian girl
You know that you came and you changed my world
Just like in the movie
We're two lovers in the scene
And she says "do you love me?"
And he says "so endlessly"
I love you, Liberian girl
I love you too, I want you to
Uuh baby
I love you too, I want you to
Our love

Liberian girl
More precious than any pearl
Your love so complete
Liberian girl
You kissed me then ooh the world
You do this to me

Liberian girl
You know that you came and you changed my world
Just like in the movie
We're two lovers in the scene
And she says "do you love me?"
And he says "so endlessly"
I love you, Liberian girl
I love you too, I want you to
Uuh baby
I love you too, I want you to
Our love

What you're doin' to me?
What you're doin' to me?
What you're doin' to me?
What you're doin' to me?

Liberian girl
You know that you came and you changed my world
I wait for that day when you have to say you do
And I started saying too
And to heaven we'll be true
I love you, Liberian girl
All the time I'll love you, Liberian girl
All the time I'll love you, Liberian girl
I love you baby
I love you
I love you baby
Liberian girl
