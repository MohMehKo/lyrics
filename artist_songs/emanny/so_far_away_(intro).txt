Throw your whole life searchin'
But then you realize
You just left with it
Songs about her

What seems so close
Had to be a no way now
'Til you wake up that one day
And you realize it's so far away
So far away

Girl, I can't help it
My heart is helpless
So far away
When I know I should be waitin'
I should be waitin'
But I keep chasin'
But I keep chasin'
You're so far away

A victim of this circumstance
So far away
And at the end, a victim of your choice
So far away
But I think it's me and you
So far away
Turns out, it truly never was us
And I realize

Girl, I can't help it
My heart is helpless
So far away
I should be waitin'
But I keep chasin'
You're so far away

So far away
So far away
So far away
I keep waitin'
So far away baby
I realize
You're so far away
So far away
