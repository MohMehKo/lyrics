I'm the man, but you already know by now
Came to say you take it all off from me, I'm on you,
Spread your legs like you're Jumpman 23
I know you're not stripping for free
I got benz like drumming the beat
And you know it
If I'd throw all this money,
I'd probably could pay for your ass
And I ain't got [?] there's something your ass can't buy
But there's something bout you that's been making me want you so bad
Come work for this morning
I reserved a spot right in front of you
I'm throwing these ones, and it's just us two
Do I have to do this every time to stay on your mind?
'Cause if I do, I will, I will

Girl, this stage belongs to you
And every single I throw on your body baby
If I leave, are you coming, too?
Well, tonight's the night you do!
Well, tonight's the night you do!
Well, tonight's the night you do!
Well, tonight's the night you do!

Girl, how many benz, how many benz it'd take?
To keep you right here, keep you right here with me?
I'm jealous, don't want no one on your body
If only I could make this dance a private
I taste it already
If I'd throw all this money,
I'd probably could pay for your ass
And I ain't got [?] there's something your ass can't buy
But there's something bout you that's been making me want you so bad
Come work for this morning
I reserved a spot right in front of you
I'm throwing these ones, and it's just us two
Do I have to do this every time to stay on your mind?
'Cause if I do, I will, I will

Girl, this stage belongs to you
And every single I throw on your body baby
If I leave, are you coming, too?
Well, tonight's the night you do!
Well, tonight's the night you do!
