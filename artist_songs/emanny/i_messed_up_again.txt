[Verse 1:]
This wasn't what it suppose to be
Found myself right back with the woman I was suppose to leave
And even with all the pain and drama she find herself back to me
And I let her in
And we right back where we ended
I know that what we are ain't right
Thought I'd leave her after one night
Heading right back in her bed
She all in my head and I ain't think twice
Said she love me but it don't show
And she with a nigga while I'm on the road
And if she fuck around with that fuck around
He gonna fuck around and get smoked

[Bridge]
Cause I gave this girl my life, put in all my time
Even when I knew we wouldn't last
Still stuck around and I try to make things work
Through all this hurt but we get bad then get worse
And with everything I learnt before sad to say that...

[Hook]
I messed up
I messed up
I messed up again, [X2]

And it's just the way the world turns
Some people don't learn
Its to late to change it, it's too late

I messed up
I messed up
I messed up again [X2]

And it's just the way the world turns
Sometimes you got to crash before you learn

I messed up, I messed up again

[Verse 2:]
Feels like I fucked up a plan
Like I'm less of a man
Because I was once here before
Swore I wouldn't be again
Last time I fell for your lust
And put my heart in your trust
To regret what we were
Just to go back and mess up again

[Bridge]
