[Verse 1:]
You lied to my face
Sell out my soul, oh
Let him take my place, oh, oh
We can never be whole again
I don't care if you're still in love with me
You broke every route to my loyalty
So wrong, wrong, wrong
What you did to me

[Hook:]
Fuck you bitch, yeah
How you gonna just use my heart
Fuck you bitch yeah
Tired of playing these games
So you know I'm out
Fuck, fuck you bitch
Fuck you bitch, yeah

[Verse 2:]
Now that I'm gone
I can finally say
How I will be just dumb for
Cuffin' someone who don't truly belong to me
Used to tell me I was Mr. Right
I was the only one you needed in your life
But now that I know
I know I gotta let go
Let go of you girl

[Hook:]
Fuck you bitch, yeah
How you gonna just use my heart
Fuck you bitch yeah
Tired of playing these games
So you know I'm out
Fuck, fuck you bitch
Fuck you bitch, yeah

[Verse 3:]
There ain't no reason in this world for me to stay
I put my heart into your hands and what you did
You took it from me
You took it from me

[Outro:]
Fuck you bitch yeah
Tired of playing these games
So you know I'm out
Fuck, fuck you bitch
Fuck you bitch, yeah
Fuck you bitch, yeah
Fuck you bitch, yeah
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck you bitch
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck you bitch
