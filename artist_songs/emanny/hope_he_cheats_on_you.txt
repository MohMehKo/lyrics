[Verse 1:]
I hope he cheats on you with a Sin City stripper
Treat her real good
Even have a kid with her
Eat your own dose of the medicine you gave me
He leave you all alone
Make you feel less than a lady

[Bridge:]
You might think I'm tripping
How could I be tripping
You know why I'm tripping
You left me to be with him
I'm stuck here crazy
Tryna figure why you play me
This how yo repay me
You shady

[Hook:]
Baby, sex so good
Do you remember, oh
Baby, sex so good

But look at how it all turned out now
I hope he cheats on you with a Sin City stripper
Look at how it all turned out now
I hope he do you wrong baby cause we're not together
But look at how it all turned out now
I hope he cheats on you with a Sin City stripper
Look at how it all turned out now
Not that hard without you

But you wasted time with him
He know ho to bring home the Louis and the Gucci
But he also brought you home a STD

[Bridge:]
You might think I'm tripping

You know why I'm tripping
You left me to be with him

Tryna figure why you play me
This how yo repay me
You shady

[Hook:]
Baby, sex so good

Baby, sex so good
