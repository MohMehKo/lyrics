I'm gonna kiss you, suck you, taste you, bite you
Feel me make you come to
Can I make you come?
Baby I don't mind touching you
Ever so slowly
Making you quiver
Baby would you mind undressing me?
Making you feel sexy
While in the morning
Cause I'm gonna play you, bite you, caress you
Tell you how much I've missed you
I just wanna touch you, teach you, make you
Please you, love you, hold you
Make love to you
I'm gonna kiss you, suck you, taste you, bite you
Feel me deep inside of you
I'm gonna kiss you, suck you, taste you, bite you
Feel me make you come to
And I make you come

Baby I don't mind kissing you
All over your body
I missed a spot
Baby I don't mind touching you
It's making you so juicy
Feeling your lips on my

Cause I'm gonna play you, bite you, caress you
Tell you how much I've missed you
I just wanna touch you, teach you, make you
Please you, love you, hold you
Make love to you
I'm gonna kiss you, suck you, taste you, bite you
Feel me deep inside of you
I'm gonna kiss you, suck you, taste you, bite you
Feel me make you come to
And I make you come

Baby would you mind if I came inside of you?
Letting my juices flee
Leaving your passion

Cause I'm gonna play you, bite you, caress you
Tell you how much I've missed you
I just wanna touch you, teach you, make you
Please you, love you, hold you
Make love to you
And I'm gonna kiss you, suck you, taste you, bite you
Feel me deep inside of you
I'm gonna kiss you, suck you, taste you, bite you
Feel me make you come to
Can I make you come?

Cause I'm gonna play you, bite you, caress you
Tell you how much I've missed you
Touch you, teach you, make you
Please you, love you, hold you
Make love to you
Gonna kiss you, suck you, taste you, bite you
Feel me deep inside of you
Gonna kiss you, suck you, taste you, bite you
Feel me make you come to
Can I make you come?
