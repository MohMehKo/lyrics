You hide hurt by the things you did
I just couldn't imagine
Someone taking advantage of the love you give
And now it seems like I can't move on
So I think I gotta hold on strong
How can I help you get over it
I just say to see see

[Pre-Chorus:]
Don't cry all those nights that you've tried
To put em in the past [?]
Baby you have someone here
You want it to be in your life
But you just don't feel it
[?] the right time
Maybe girl you know I'm here
Tryin to be patient but

[Chorus:]
It is the right time, girl you will be mine
Girl you don't know how I feel
Give me a chance
And I wanna make things right
Holding by your side just sayin [?]
Tell em girl isn't right time

Tell me was the right time, tell me was the right time yeah yeah

You think you're a fool for doing all the things you do
Girl there ain't even cool
You need to go and throw the blame on him
You was a game with him but with me
You never go on happy
What you [?] you need to make a move
Girl was wrong with you it's like you have

[Pre-Chorus:]
Don't cry all those nights that you've tried
To put em in the past [?]
Baby you have someone here
You want it to be in your life
But you just don't feel it
[?] the right time
Maybe girl you know I'm here
Tryin to be patient but

[Chorus: x2]
It is the right time, girl you will be mine
Girl you don't know how I feel
Give me a chance
And I wanna make things right
Holding by your side just sayin [?]
Tell me girl isn't right time

Tell me when the right time
Tell me when the right time
Tell em when the right time
Time
