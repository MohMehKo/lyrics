She in the first year [?]
She told me that she wanna be a doctor
Free every way she go she a hot woman
And never met her she put a brick on proper

[Chorus:]
She don't eat lobster don't drink no Champaign
Don't want no boyfriend don't want no wedding ring
She ain't' worrying about the money
'Cause sex is the only thing she wants from me
Anything she want, she gonna get it, she gonna get it
She gonna give it all, I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
She may be young but she's ready [x2]
She's too young to make love
Gonna to make love, old enough to get
She got lost and hot us
She just wanna be touched
She may be young but she's ready [x2]

She got the mind of a lawyer
But the body of a dancer
You know she a freakier she a [?]
Is it like a ruff so you ain't gotta romance her

[Chorus:]
She don't eat lobster don't drink no Champaign
Don't want no boyfriend don't want no wedding ring
She ain't' worrying about the money
'Cause sex is the only thing she wants from me
Anything she want, she gonna get it, she gonna get it
She gonna give it all, I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
She may be young but she's ready [x2]
She's too young to make love
Gonna to make love, old enough to get
She got lost and hot us
She just wanna be touched
She may be young but she's ready [x2]

So is like we both made off school [?]
Took her down the hall to the [?] Loss
Yeah we in the hood but she never been in this spot
Got a bottle of handy took a [?] to the fish bottom with Dutch with her
Got ruff with her, planned on leaving but I won't [?]
It was outrageous at me on the day 'cause she put it down
I forgot what the age was
Some about the [?] Come heavy
To the small shower after getting dump sweaty
Back shot crazy don't get steady
Yeah I know she was young but she was ready

[Chorus:]
She don't eat lobster don't drink no Champaign
Don't want no boyfriend don't want no wedding ring
She ain't' worrying about the money
'Cause sex is the only thing she wants from me
Anything she want, she gonna get it, she gonna get it
She gonna give it all, I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
She may be young but she's ready [x2]
She's too young to make love
Gonna to make love, old enough to get
She got lost and hot us
She just wanna be touched
She may be young but she's ready [x2]
