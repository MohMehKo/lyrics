[Joe Budden:]
Jumpoff!
(I'm here Emanny, break up to make up baby)
Look!
I still see your lipstick on that empty glass of Tequila;
I lay down in the bed and still feel 'er,
I see her face when I walk by the mirror;
Got her voice stuck in my head I still hear 'er,
Trips to China, scents, make up, eye liner almost like everything is a reminder,
Of my ex soul mate; I always thought if times got too hard our history would hold weight;
Packed up jetted, left me with no face;
I wonder if you miss the old days, played out like a chapter in a book,
Wonder if you moved on or how fast it took;
Are you content or happy? You know what I mean,
With no arguing does he make you scream?
Brushed myself off hop right back on the scene like I never went nowhere,
Now let Emanny go there!

[Emanny:]
I can see, back when we, used to talk about the things we shared just everything; (a family)
And I can see, back when you used to hold my hand and guide me show your love for me, (how much you cared)
But that's all in the past, now your walking with somebody else holding his hand, (how could this be)
but only me reminiscing on something that I thought would be but obviously all I can do

[Chorus:]
All I can do, is just sit home and cry over you
Oh I wish I didn't feel like I do, going crazy cause I'm lonely and blue
I don't think I can do without you

[Emanny:]
I can see, like when you used to tell me you wanna marry me have my baby, (but now your gone)
For too long I could see, how you sex me but down that love for me caressing me (and when love is lost)
And do you know, what it feels like
When your world has moved on on on on on on on on (and your alone)
Cause if you did, you might see how it feels to be me, and
All I can do (all I can do no no no)

[Chorus:]
All I can do, is just sit home and cry over you (cry over you)
Oh I wish I didn't feel like I do (feel like I do), going crazy cause I'm lonely and blue (lonely and blue)
I don't think I can do without you [x2]

[Bridge:]
My love I gave to you, but all you did is use me like a damn fool (that I can't believe)
you stole my heart from me and you left me with no choice (with no choice)

[Chorus:]
All I can do, is just sit home and cry over you (cry over you)
Oh I wish I didn't feel like I do (feel like I do), going crazy cause I'm lonely and blue (lonely and blue)
I don't think I can do without you [x2]
