Said you want the lights on
You ain't looking for an angel
Don't worry about your make-up
Uh, what you're afraid of?
A devil undercovers
Get your words to start over
Right before another, another round, another round!

[Pre-Chorus:]
I didn't know you got down right that
You know they say that when a good girl goes bad
She won't go back, she can't go back!
If I pull too hard, it will all grow back
Don't worry, no, no, no!
Don't worry, no, no, no!
If you ain't in a hurry, no!
Baby, we can go a little longer, longer!

[Chorus:]
I'm not dreaming
I see clearer
When I look through smoking mirrors
If I open up the window
So nobody else knows
Well, I know and you know
Confessions of a nympho!
Nympho, nympho, confessions of a nympho!

She pushed me to the wall, made me look twice
Whispered to my ear, don't worry, I don't bite!
Even if I did, you probably wouldn't mind
She pushing up and pulling at the same damn time!

[Pre-Chorus:]
I didn't know you got down right that
You know they say that when a good girl goes bad
She won't go back, she can't go back!
If I pull too hard, it will all grow back
Don't worry, no, no, no!
Don't worry, no, no, no!
If you ain't in a hurry, no!
Baby, we can go a little longer, longer!

[Chorus:]
I'm not dreaming
I see clearer
When I look through smoking mirrors
If I open up the window
So nobody else knows
Well, I know and you know
Confessions of a nympho!
Nympho, nympho, confessions of a nympho!
