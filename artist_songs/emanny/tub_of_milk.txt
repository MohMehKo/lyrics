Picture you covered in me. 
Oh what great lovers we'll be. 
Cause what we're doing is sacred, 
lay your body down naked. 
All you gotta do is take it. 
I love it when you take it. 
I'll kiss you everywhere 
while we're in this tub of milk.

I don't want to waste your time 
cause we will never get it back. 
And I've never seen a woman so fine, so fine.
Let's not converse, reemerge 
and I can lay you down on your back, 
working all the way down your spine, your spine.

I wanna taste tears coming out your mouth. 
Promise you gon sigh when you feel my soul inside of yours. 
You like it raw, you ride for yours and me. 
Feeling your firm grip on my hand, 
high and you don't want to land. 
Scratching on me gets matrimony cause I'm all you need.

Baby I ain't with them mind games, 
even though I know that you don't mind game. 
Plus I'm a little popular, 
so I'm hoping you don't mind fame. 
You look and smell just like you're heaven sent. 
Fuck them hoes the way you represent. 
All that I've been thinking bout ever since is you.

Just trying to please you, tease you, 
lick you, feel you, all over baby. 
I just wanna hear you, hear you call my name, girl. 
I just want to feel you, make you go insane, girl.
We can do it how you want to. 
We can do it in the bathroom. 
We can do this in the shower. 
Every second, every hour. 
No one should have this kind of power, baby. 
No one should do this to me, 
but girl that's what you wanted, wanted, wanted. 
Then girl that's what you get, get, get. 
Girl, that's what you needed, needed, needed.
