I finally had all my ducks in a row,
peace and quiet, the means of subtraction.
And how she got in, I'm not sure that I know.
Two weeks on and my spine was in traction, my eyes in a basket.

Well, god in my heart is so out of phase,
and that kind of girl she nobody's daughter.
I'm just not used to these powerful waves
She's Shining the brass and I'm taking on water.
What am I to do now?

I call on a beautiful wish with a moral compass
Bait and Switch

Hide from my psychic derailer,
drive this car to the sea,
spend the night as high as I can in a towering hemlock.

But it's no use I can always be found
A creature of habit has no real protection
I'll tell her I leave if she don't settle down
She sees it's a lie on closer inspection
Like everyone else does.

The running, a terrible charm,
all this smoke in my eyes
I'm just a simple man
cursed with an honest heart
Why'd she go and tear it all apart?
