Go without 'til the need seeps in your love anymore
Collecting of the petals for the stem,

And glow, glow, melt and flow,
Eviscerate your fragile frame and spill it out in the ragged floor,
A thousand different versions of yourself,

And if the old guards still defend,
They got nothing left on which you depend,
So enlist every ounce of your bright blood,
And off with their heads.

Jump from the book,
You're not obliged to swallow anything you despise,

See, those unrepenting buzzards want your life,
And they got no right,
As sure as you have eyes,
They got no right.

Just put yourself in my new shoes,
And see that I do what I do,

Because the old guards still defend (petty guards and shiny hands)
We got nothing left on which we depend,
So enlist every ounce of your bright blood,
And off with their heads,

Jump from the book,
And you're not obliged to swallow anything that you despise, you despise, you despise, you despise, you despise
