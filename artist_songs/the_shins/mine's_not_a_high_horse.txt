After that confrontation
You left me wringing my cold hands
We shared some information 
We might not recover from 
And I watch your convictions 
Melt like ice cubes in an ocean 
You were so poorly cast as a malcontent

You've got them all on your side 
That just makes more for doubt to slaughter 
"I never knew he thought that!" 
I heard you say falling out of the van 
"Don't ask for his opinion
They ought to drown him in holy water" 
Will you remember my reply 
When your high horse dies?

We'd like to go the distance 
But not a one of us is going to you 
See no one is wise enough to turn the ancient boat around 
These are the muddy waters I am swimming in 
To make a living were I to drown in them 
It should come as no surprise

You've got them all on your side 
That just makes more for doubt to slaughter 
"I never knew he thought that!" 
I heard you say falling out of the van 
"Don't ask for his opinion
They ought to drown him in holy water" 
Will you remember my reply 
one finger parallel to the sky?
