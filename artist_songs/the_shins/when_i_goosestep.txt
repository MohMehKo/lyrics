When you're riding the rails with those wide open eyes,
Well, there's one old south paw you will always fight.
And alone on a worn-out throne 
is the reigning queen of the questions
Why we blind-footed toddlers ever started out.

So don't get into it with me
When I goose-step
Across the kitchen floor
You know I still adore
All your mother's old-fashioned ways
I'm so impressed that you hear
My inventions, and that it matters more
Than what you saw with your eyes

Go along with the plan
Your head will still be there where you put it
Under the bed with the ice cream you could never find
And tonight you go to bed and dream 
All the world to be what you want it,
You got the girly draw now flaunt it,
And keep them all checking their watches
When you're out tonight

So don't get into it with me
When I goose-step across the kitchen floor
You know I still adore--
Are your eyes changing hands?
I'm so impressed that you hear
My inventions, and that it matters more
Than what you saw with your eyes
