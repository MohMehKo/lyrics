That hue in the sky
Just a glimpse of another life
Are barley missed by some stupid collection
Life's random dominoes, if it only been more aggressive.

Oh and it burns me up.
My friends might as well have pissed in my cup.
Cause they knew and they never spoke up.
You wanted the same as I did and I never will forgive them.

Is there something I'm failing to see
A message in the stars.
Secrets lying hidden from me
Not sure what they are, if it keeping us apart?

She had Wilson Pickett's best on 45
And one night you know she gave me ride
to my place and we were all alone.
But still neglected to mention.

Is there something I'm failing to see
A message in the stars.
Secrets lying hidden from me
Not sure where they are
Tell me am I always to be, watching from a far
Cause your image breaks my heart.

Now the waltz is over
Passed into the

Now the waltz is over
passed into the

Cause the day will finally come
When time will have rendered me numb.
Maybe then I can put it down.
Let me linger for a moment now.
Collect some details to recall
Some part of life before it all
fades into the darkness.

Is there something I'm failing to see
A message in the stars.
Secrets lying hidden from me
Not sure where they are
Tell me am I always to be, watching from a far
Cause your image breaks my heart.
