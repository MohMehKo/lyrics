I think i'll go home and mull this over 
Before i cram it down my throat 
At long last it's crashed, it's colossal mass 
Has broken up into bits in my moat. 

Lift the mattress off the floor 
Walk the cramps off 
Go meander in the cold 
Hail to your dark skin 
Hiding the fact you're dead again 
Undeneath the power lines seeking shade 
Far above our heads are the icy heights that contain all reason 

It's a luscious mix of words and tricks 
That let us bet when you know we should fold 
On rocks i dreamt of where we'd stepped 
And the whole mess of roads we're now on. 

Hold your glass up, hold it in 
Never betray the way you've always known it is. 
One day i'll be wondering how 
I got so old just wondering how 
I never got cold wearing nothing in the snow. 

This is way beyond my remote concern 
Of being condescending 

All these squawking birds won't quit. 
Building nothing, laying bricks.
