Eyeless in the morning sun you were
Pale and mild, a modern girl
Taken with thought, still prone to care
Makin tea in your underwear
You went out in the yard to find 

Something to eat and clear your mind 
Something bad inside me went away

Quaking leaves and broken light 
Shifting skin the coming night 
The bearers of all good things arrive 
Climb inside us, twist and cry 
A kiss on your molten eyes 

Myriad lives like blades of grass 
Yet to be realized, bow as they pass

They are cold, 
Still, 
Waiting in the ether, 
To form, 
Feel, 
Kill, 
Propagate, 
Only to die
[x2]

Dissolve 
Magically, 
Absurdly, 
They'll end, 
Leave, 
Dissipate, 
Coldly 
And strangely 
Return
