I had this crazy idea
Somehow we cruise to the end
Change lives and everything precious
Guess we'll just begin again

Oh girl, it's been a while
Since we met, out there in the cold
Seems so long ago
It's hard not to imagine
The lives we used to have
When the nights were rather cold
So now what?

I had this crazy idea
Somehow we cruise to the end
Change lives and everything precious
And I guess we'll just begin again
I think you know you're my best friend

It's one of them unspoken rules
If things would not turn out the way we planned
You know that I would hurt
I can handle all of that
If I can still take you there
And you still think I am strong
But I admit that I was wrong
So now what?

I had this crazy idea
Somehow we cruise to the end
Change lives and everything precious
And I guess we'll just begin again
I hope you know you're my best friend

I had this crazy idea
Somehow we cruise to the end
Change lives and everything precious
And I guess we'll just begin again
I hope you know you're my best friend

I guess we'll just begin again [x7]
