We all need somebody
We all have a soul to save
You're not cheap
So you think you're gonna get your way

When you lie, cheat and steal
Bury your own to make a deal
I've been in chains
And I don't like the way it feels

Betchya gotta cure for me
Betchya put me out of pain
Betchya gotta a cure for me
Without a stitch of shame
Betchya gotta a Messiah thing
Betchya fill my prescription
Betchya gotta cure for me
Betchyou'll be my addiction

We all wanna be somebody
We all have a price to pay
You'll succeed
But you'll never throw your past away

Betchya gotta cure for me
Betchya put me out of pain
Betchya gotta a cure for me
Without a stitch of shame
Betchya gotta a Messiah thing
Betchya fill my prescription
Betchya gotta cure for me
Betchyou'll be my addiction
