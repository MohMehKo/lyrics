Money will talk for you
Coats your tongue like sugar
Sweet lies
To pacify the hunger
Money will kill for you
Lay your head to rest now
Dream of the whitest street
Clean, rebuilt for you

We’re headed for big trouble
Brewing in the rubble

I won’t bow to evil
I won’t stoop to your injustice
You robbed the greatest people of the earth they rose their children on
And I am grateful I am in this country now
But I will never forget the land and the sea and the sky
I come from

You never fenced me in
My spirit gives you chills and
Sweeping your desert like the wind
Nations gather for a reckoning
You may be deaf but every rock and tree is listening

I won’t bow to evil
I won’t stoop to your injustice
You robbed the greatest people of the earth they rose their children on
And I am grateful to be in this country now
But I will never for get the land and the sea and the sky
I come from

Come on and give us a truthful tongue
We’ve got to make a peaceful mission from now on
I am thankful for the choices I have now
But we’ve got to protect the land and the sea and the sky
We come from.
