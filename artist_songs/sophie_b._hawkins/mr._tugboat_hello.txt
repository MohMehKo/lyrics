You won't be strong
For me I'm sure
How could I have lost my heart
To one so insecure
Desire
Hard to resist
But for whom 
I exist

Love I give my eyes to read your signs
No compromise your faith is mine
I don't despise the endless time
It takes to realize that I
Am just a fool
Though you were cruel
To show me paradise so soon

I don't know why
I hardly care
Happy disillusions fade
When passion's in the air
Fire water and salt
Madness inspired
Pain
Let it remain my fault

Hate me for a while I saw you cheat
It's not my style to break the heat
Murder is vile and death is sweet
I have to smile at my defeat
Yes I'm insane
Though just the same
You must have recognized my name

Mr. Tugboat hello
Ocean liner
Finer day no ma'am
Oooh and I have no plans
Just to do as I please
Back to the breeze
Sailing around my island
Everybody's outside
Love has arrived
I wanna be your friend
Living it up together baby
Give me up I'll
Drive you crazy
Can't find me baby
So climb

The story's true
I can't deny
First thing I was born to see
Was mama cry
Raspberries and wine
Boxing gloves
Train stations and valentines

Paris I'm in debt I can't come home
My lips are wet I hate the phone
J'ai un regrette et mes chansons
I bumped my head while you were gone
You thought for you
As though for two
