You didn't chose me
You left me for the dark hearted one
Your shadow is bigger than your sun
I thought we were one

You didn't hear me
You listened to those beautiful lies
And my truth is still locked inside
Oh why did I give you the 

Key to my heart
I don't have another and I
Wanna break these chains apart
My soul is free
To fly through the worlds above

But my feelings still wait for your love

I wake up crying
But in my dreams we're happy and bright
You laugh and everything's all right
What did you do with the 

Key to my heart
I don't have another and I
Wanna break these chains apart
My soul is free
To fly through the worlds above
But my feelings still wait for your love
And I need to know why you
Seemed like the answer to my prayers
And all I had to do
Was call and you'd be there
Now my heart can see
What my mind can't bear to know
That the angel of darkness has got your soul.
