Bird flyin' high
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Breeze drifting by
You know how I feel. 

It's a new dawn
A new day
A new life 
For me … feelin' good. 

Hey there fish in the sea
You know how I feel
River runnin' free
You know how I feel
Blossom on the tree
You know how I feel. 

It's a new dawn
A new day
A new life
For me … feelin' good. 

Dragonfly out in the sun 
You know what I mean 
Butterflies all having fun
You know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done
That's what I mean
And this whole world 
Is a new world
And a bold world … for me. 

Do it … 
Do it … 
Do it … 
Do it … 

Stars when ya shine
You know how I feel 
Scent of the pine
You know how I feel
Freedom is mine
And I know how I feel.

It's a new dawn
A new day 
A new life
For me …

Haaa-I feel good … 
I feel good …
I feel good …
I feel good …
