So here I am
Wishing
We could talk about everything
I want to know
How is dad
How's your work going
I want the chance
To explain
And have you understand
Before it's too late
To ever speak again

We've been missing
For too many years
And I want a healing
In place of all these tears
God give me an answer
That I can use tonight
All I want are the missing pieces
To put back in my life

And in my dreams
I'm calling To say “New York in the spring”
And if you're there, pick up,
I don't want to speak to your machine
I hope you're well
And you're strong
And dad's not in too much pain
‘Cause my heart is filling with hope
I want to try again

We've been missing
For too many years
And I want a healing
In place of all these god damned tears
Give me an answer
That I can use tonight
All I want are the missing pieces
To put back in my life

I've been missing
And I can't stand the pain
I want a feeling
That my truth is not in vain
God give me a reason
To make it be all right
For all of the missing pieces
To come
Into
My life.
