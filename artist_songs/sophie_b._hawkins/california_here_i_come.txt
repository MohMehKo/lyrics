Whoah, you
Poor you
Playing so long but you're still not grooving
I see you running but I see you ain't moving

And me
Pitiful me
I sleep with both eyes open but I'm just not seeing
The forest, let alone the trees

California, here I come
Open up your golden arms
I had enough of the New York City slums
My brother, he went before me
My God, watch over me
California, here I come

Could we stop (oh)
Obsessing?
There's food on the table, let's count our blessings
How come we wanna be messing
Messing around
With the wild, wild west
Must be a better life than this

How come
Some people got it all
Some people got none
I been banging my head against
The writing on the wall
But now
I just wanna have fun

California, here I come
Open up your golden arms
I had enough of the New York City slums
My brother, he went before me
My God, watch over me
California, I'll be there
Let me fall into your hair
I won't be guilty for my New York City care
My sister, come along with me
Our God is offering our share
California, I'll be there

Our father, who is in Heaven
Hallowed be your name
Your kingdom come, your will be done
On Earth as it is in Heaven
Give me this my daily bread
And forgive me my trespasses
As I forgive those others
Lead me not into temptation
And deliver me from evil

Yeah

California, I'll be there
I won't be guilty for my New York City care
My brother, he went before me
My God, watch over me
California, California, please

My sister, come along with me
Our God is offering
Our share
