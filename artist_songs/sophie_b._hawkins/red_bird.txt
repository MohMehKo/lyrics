Little Red Bird
I know you're feeling blue
'Cause the black bird broke your wing
And you think you'll never soar again
But you're higher than you've ever been before
You just don't see it
Anymore
Someday you'll find out
Who you really are
You'll know why you had to fly so far away
From you're beloved park
And all the nights you flew alone into the dark
They taught you how to see with your heart

You're in bed bird
Though you're ageless in your mind
You have sailed so many seas
Now the passage is obscured from view
So close your eyes and concentrate on breaking through

Someday you'll find out
Who you really are
You'll know why you had to fly so far away
From you're beloved park
And all the nights you flew alone into the dark
They taught you how to see

And when you finally land
You'll be surprised to learn
All you've lost has been returned
