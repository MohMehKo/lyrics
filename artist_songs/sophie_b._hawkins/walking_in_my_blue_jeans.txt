In their lives,
love has hit her face
to save her heart from braking
into feeling

In your eyes,
joy gives way to pain
save your tears for the rain
visions stop at the ceiling
without each other
what would we be
we'll long to feel free
and in our dreams
we see
what we need

[Chorus:]
I hardly recognize myself it's such a strange thing
to find another woman walking in my blue jeans
I've come so far and I've been so long away
come home
I'm like a photograph whose image is still changing
and then the letter that i never sent to you explaining
all I want is a place for my heart to belong

In our lives,
we have weapons and cures for disease
and their right here in an instant that it takes us to concieve
without each other
where will we go
someday we will know
and if we want to
we will grow
closer and closer together

[Chorus]
