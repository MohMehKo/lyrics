You make me cry
I don't even know why
I open so wide
to fit you
Sometimes I wanna leave you
cause I know you can't be true
I wanna believe you
Sometimes I almost do
But you will never change
And I don't wanna say goodbye
cause when I look in your eyes
You make me high
And I don't wanna be 
just a speck on your horizon
So when you land this time I hope you'll let me know
Is this something that could grow
Or am I still alone
Cause when I'm with you I feel
That I've finally found a home
There may be no windows or a door
a ceiling or a floor
but you make me high
