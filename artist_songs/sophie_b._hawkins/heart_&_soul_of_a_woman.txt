You've taken one too many stands
Now no one wants to be your friend
When out of the mist
Comes a
Feminine twist
Who won't leave you alone 'til your
Back on your feet again

Love that is sublime
In ways you can't define
That's the heart and soul
Of a woman
Kisses that understand
Sometimes the strongest man
Has the heart and soul
Of a woman

You've been through every kind of hell
But that's not the story you would tell
'Cause out of the pits
Comes this
Goddess like myth
You couldn't get up so she
lifted you herself

Love that is sublime
In ways you can't define
That's the heart and soul
Of a woman
Kisses that understand
Sometimes the strongest man
Has the heart and soul of a woman

That's the way
it ought to be
A woman gives life
And love is what she needs
And when you're crying out
For the girl that you once knew
Look inside
She never left you

Feelings so divine
Why would you decline
That's the heart and soul
Of a woman
Words that make you cry
Oh the smartest guys
Have the heart and soul
Of a woman

Love that is sublime
Please don't define
That's the heart and soul
Of a woman

Kisses that make you cry
The most enchanting eyes
Have the heat and soul
Of a woman.
