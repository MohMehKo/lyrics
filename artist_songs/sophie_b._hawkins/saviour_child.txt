Hey, child
You're so wise
Will you tell me what you're thinking
I don't need an answer
Just to talk to you awhile
I stop searching
When I see you smile

Yeah, child
I am crying
'Cause I know just how you're feeling
But there won't be an answer
For a long, long while (yeah)
So promise me
You won't stop dreaming

[CHORUS]
Color rainbows in the rain
And follow to a heart of gold
There's a saviour born every day
In the valley of your soul

It's you, child, hello
So learn the truth
Though most folks, they'll keep on lying
There will be an answer
Just you give yourself the time
And promise me
You won't stop trying, yeah

[CHORUS]

(In the valley)
(In the valley)
(In the valley)
There is a savior born (in the valley)
There is a savior born (in the valley)
There is a savior born every day (in the valley)
There is a savior born every day (in the valley)
There is a savior born every day (in the valley)
There is a savior born every day (in the valley) there is a savior born every day
There is a savior born every day (in the valley) there is a savior born every day
There is a savior born every day (in the valley) there is a savior born every day
There is a savior

There is a savior born every day (in the valley) there is a savior born every day
There is a savior born every day (in the valley) there is a savior born every day
There is a savior born every day (in the valley) there is a savior born every day
There is a savior born every day (in the valley) there is a savior born every day
There is a savior born every day (in the valley) there is a savior born every day
There is a savior born every day (in the valley) there is a savior born every day
There is a savior born every day (in the valley) there is a savior born every day
There is a savior born every day (in the valley) there is a savior born every day
There, oh, we love you
