Watch Gabrielle
She's something to see
She's courageous and says 
What she truly believes
Let's go to the Safeway
And start the new year
Listening there's something
I long to hear

So she stood on the corner in the bright winter sun
Like a flag in the perilous fight
And the man in the parking lot drew out his gun
And shot an American light

Now we are flying at half mast
And we are crying for our past
As a great nation dies
And we can't recognize
What's become of our lives
Baby we're losing freedom fast

Christina Taylor
Born on a day
When even the atheists
Knelt down to pray

And the salt of the earth cried out in pain
As the bullet went into her heart
And our soldiers and sailors have all died in vain
If a madman tears our country apart

Now we are flying at half mast
And we are crying for our past
As a great nation dies
And we can't recognize
What's become of our lives
Yes we are losing freedom fast

As we are falling from our hight
Liberty's calling us to fight
For the stripes and the stars
As we gain battle scars
'Til we know who we are
America full mast
New flight
