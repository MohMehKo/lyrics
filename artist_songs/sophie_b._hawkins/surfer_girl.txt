Let me be your guitar strummer
Catch a wave between your curls
All I need is one hot summer
To become my surfer girl
I don't wanna build a castle of sand without your help
I don't wanna wade in the water with anyone else
Let me be your diving partner
Teach you not to be afraid
To go deeper for the treasure that was lost one stormy day

I'd rather be your surfer girl
Than have all the riches in the world
And I'd rather lie with you on the beach
Than suffer admirers at my feet
Why can't I be your surfer child?
And catch the stars as they fall from your eyes
Sweep me out in your rip tide
Ride ride ride

Let me be your conga player
Serenade you on the street
Al the natives' gather there
In the evening by the sea
I'd rather be your surfer girl
Than have all the riches in this world
And I'd rather lie with you on the beach than suffer admirers at my feet
Why can't I be your surfer child 
And catch the stars as they dull from your eyes
Sweep me out in your riptide
Ride ride ride
