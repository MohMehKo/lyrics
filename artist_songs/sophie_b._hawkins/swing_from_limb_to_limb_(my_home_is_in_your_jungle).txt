Falling falling
Into the river of your soul for me to know
I am floating on this current somewhere where love abounds
Distant calling
The sun goes down the beasts start home say come along
I ain't about to shake off this sweet water, it's warm

Oh babe, you weren't wrong
I swing from limb to limb but it's your stuff that keeps me hangin' on
My home is in your jungle
With your skies so blue
Those monkeys gave us much to love you copy me, I'll copy you

Kissing kissing
Beneath the trees we know so well
If they could tell
Of generations
Hugging hugging
And rubbing go much slower
As you get lower
I don't want to miss on one sensation

Oh babe, you weren't wrong
I swing from limb to limb but it's your stuff that keeps me hangin' on
My home is in your jungle
With your skies so blue
Those monkeys gave us much to love you copy me, I'll copy you

Babe, it's alright
I can swing on anything as long as when I come you hold me tight
My home is in your jungle
With your skies so blue
Those monkeys left us much to learn
You show me how, I'll show you too
[repeat twice]

My home is in your jungle, with your sky so blue....
I showed you too, babe....
My home is in your jungle....
