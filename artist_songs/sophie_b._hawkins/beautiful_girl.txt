Are you alright
Is there a light
Can you still hear me where you are
Are you so fine
That you can slip between the lines

You're such a Beautiful Beautiful Girl
You make the sky come down
You make the earth go round
You're such a Beautiful Beautiful Girl
And when you walk in the room
You make the winter bloom
You're such a beautiful Beautiful Girl

They want your soul
But you can float away
A flock of angels just above your head
Can hear your every sigh 
And love you when you cry

You're such a beautiful Beautiful Girl
You make the sky come down
You make the earth go round
You're such a Beautiful beautiful Girl
And when you walk in the room
You make the winter bloom
You're such a beautiful beautiful Girl
You drive your daddy mad
You make your momma sad
You're such a beautiful, beautiful Girl
You make the wise unsure
You make the rich feel poorâ€¦
