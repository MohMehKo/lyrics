I lied
I stole in the name of fear
But I won't be silent here

I don't want somewhere to run to
I don't want somebody I can shake
Lord, I want my dignity again
Before I walk on fire
You gotta look me in the face

I won't flinch, and I won't turn away

I'm sorry
I'm sorry for being scared
But I won't drop you in there
Oh, darling
Let me show you I love you
Oh, world
Let me show you I care

I don't want somewhere to run to
I don't want somebody I can shake
Lord, I want my dignity again
Before I walk on fire
You gotta look me in the face

Give me back my touch
Give me back my feeling
Give me everything
I wanna be your witness
I want you to believe in me

(I'll show you, you'll guide me)
(I'll hold you inside me)
Before I walk on fire
(I'll show you, you'll guide me)
Come inside me
(I'll hold you inside me)
Before I walk on fire
(I'll show you, you'll guide me)
You will guide me
(I'll hold you inside me)
Come on, baby, before I walk on fire
(I'll show you, you'll guide me)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(I'll hold you inside me)
Come on, baby
(I'll show you, you'll guide me)
Come on, darling, yeah
(I'll hold you inside me)
Before I walk on fire, yeah
(I'll show you, you'll guide me)
Before I walk on fire
(I'll hold you inside me)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
