[Soft whisper:] Tell me what to to

I have no confidence
And I can't see why I should
But I could do most anything for you
And you know I would

I try too hard
And then I give up way too easily
I'm the runner-up inside of you
And you're the winner inside of me

Lose your way
And I will follow
Here today
And here tomorrow
Like my freedom I know
I’ll never let you go

I still wish on the evening star
And I s’pose I always will
Every child loses something a whole life can’t fulfill
And when you cry I feel the sky burst open in my veins
If loving you makes a slave of me then I'll spend my whole life in chains

Lose your way
And I will follow
Here today
And here tomorrow
Like my freedom I know
I’ll never let you go

Walk the line
I’ll walk inside you
Change your mind
Let your love decide you
It’s the reason I know
You’ll never let me go
Never let me go
Oh no, no, baby
Never let me go
Ahh, ahhh ain't that right now, baby

Lose your way
And I will follow
Here today
And here tomorrow
Like my freedom I know
I’ll never let you go

Walk the line
I'll walk inside you
Change your mind
Let your love decide you
It's the reason I know
You'll never let me go
