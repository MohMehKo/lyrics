Like your student
I hang on every word you say
Like your disciple
I don't have to stay
Like your heartbeat
There are things I've always known
Like your lover
I'm already part of your soul

No words can tell you what I feel
No looks can show you what I see
No one can teach me what is real
Nothing can take you away from me

Like your passion
I have waited for the key
To unlock the vision 
That will set my soul free

No words can tell you what I feel
No looks can show you what I see
No one can teach me what is real
Nothing can take you away from me
No time can give me what I need
No way around what I've been through
No space can fill up the emptiness in my soul when I want you
