Father she's playing our song
But I don't wanna dance tonight
You have just slipped away
And I'm caught inside the cage again
I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause I don't wanna fight
I wish I was miles away
Not feeling anything

You taught me to hide
Well I'm frightened of my mind
You taught me to smile
When I'm crying inside
I'm black and I'm blue and I'm wondering
Where are you
I wish I was there too
with you

Miles away
Not feeling anything
Just you and I again
Traveling for weeks on end

Father I'm slipping again
I only wanna feel my life
Raining inside my heart
Tearing nobody's world apart
And if I fly let me take you along
And if I fall let me fall in your arms
Nobody will rescue me if they don't know I'm gone
Tonight the sea is black and calm
And you are

Miles away
Not feeling anything
Closing your eyes again
Traveling for weeks on end
We were miles away
Not feeling any pain
Just you and I again
Gliding for weeks on end
Hiding
Crying
Father
