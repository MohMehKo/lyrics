Don't let
Fear stop me now
I can't bear to find out
That I've lied to myself
And risked not asking for your help

Life is a river
And it flows to the sea
I wont sit on the banks
And let it roll on by me
I need to ride on
This glistening trail
I wont get weary
With your breath in my sails

You chose
To keep right on
I'm choosing to transform
Just like being born
We all cross the misting current
One by One

Life is a river
And it flows to the sea
I wont sit on the banks
And let it roll on by me
I need to ride on
This glistening trail
I wont get weary
With your wind on my sails

So come with me darling
(potatoes fields in summertime)
And leave death behind
(running on the beach to fairyland)
We may steal a moment
(flattening pennies on the rail)
But we wont get more time
(making you furious and running away, 
running away, running away) 
Life is a river
And it flows eternally
Don't worry baby
Let's go To the sea.
Hush my baby don't you cry
Mama's gonna sing you a lullabye
