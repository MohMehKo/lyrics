I used to view the world as
Some things good and most things bad
But if you'd be my lover
I'd be more than what I am
And drifting on your ocean
I could shut my engines down
But deeper currents were in store
And I'm not anchored anymore
Your kiss, your kisses set me free
I wasn't listening before
Your lips your tongue your hands your feet
You gave everything back to me
I want you need you to feel free
Now all I want is to be this free
To touch to feel what you give me

We are one body
We are one spirit
One breath, one dream of life and death
One God, one sex
We are one body, yeah
We are one spirit
One breath, one dream of life and death
One God, one sex

It's in your solar system
It's in my super star
There's nothing more persistent
Than the planet of our heart
The flame that is between us
Could set every soul on fire
And I would love to take that heat
Let's fill the whole world with desire
Your kiss, your kisses set me free
It's too painful to deny
Your lips your tongue your hands your feet
History it's illusion
I want you need you to feel free
Come on make love to exclusion
To touch to feel what you give me

We are one body (yeah)
We are one spirit (yeah)
One breath, one dream of life and death (yeah)
One God, one sex (yeah)
We are one body, yeah (yeah)
We are one spirit (yeah)
One breath, one dream of life and death (yeah)
One God, one sex (yeah)

We are one body (alleluia)
We are one spirit (alleluia)
We are one body (alleluia)
One dream, one sex, one God, one life, one death, one, yes (alleluia)
One star, one hope, one heart, one rocket ship (alleluia)
