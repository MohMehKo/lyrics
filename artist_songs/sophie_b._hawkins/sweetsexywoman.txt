I could worship you
And I do
Nobody knows how true I stay
Even when I pray
I'm making love to you
A tuneless song
Like the dawn
Nobody can hold onto you
Even though they do
They're wrong

Sweet sexy woman
I was born to love you
Now I'm hypnotized
I have traveled many lifetimes
In search of
Your golden eyes

Sweet sexy woman
I was born to love you
Now I'm mesmerized
I have waited many lifetimes
To look inside
Your golden eyes

Someday you will come to me
And I'll give you all that I am and everything 
That's meant to be
My love is a fountain and you can drink free
Fill up on all of your needs and then some

Someday you will come to me
And I'll give you all that I am and everything
That's meant to be
My love is a mountain 
And you can climb free
You can cross all of my peaks and then some

Someday you will come to me
And I'll give you all that I am and everything
That's meant to be

My love is an ocean
And you can come free
You can float over my body or
Lay down next to me
