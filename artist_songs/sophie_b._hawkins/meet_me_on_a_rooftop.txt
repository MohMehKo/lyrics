Meet me on a rooftop
That's where I'm gonna be
This party is so old fashioned
Nothing is here for me
Meet me on a rooftop
I'll bring the radio
We can kick our shoes off
And dance really slowly
Drink a little moonshine
Have fun in clover time

I've been watching you through a fascinating prism
Moving in and out of rhythm
Climb the fire escape with me
We can spin the world around from a first class seat

Meet me on a rooftop
Ooh take a cab to the west side
Don't you worry about being so high up
Just lie beneath the city sky
See Ms. Liberty shine shine
I've been watching you through a fascinating prism
Moving in and out of rhythm
Climb the fire escape with me
We can spin the world around from a first class seat

(You bring the candles and I'll bring the Arnica oil,
I'll massage your mind until your spine uncoils)

You're enticing me with a scintillating schism
Dreaming in and out of living
Climb in my sleeping bag with me
You can spin my head around until the birds come tweet tweet tweet
