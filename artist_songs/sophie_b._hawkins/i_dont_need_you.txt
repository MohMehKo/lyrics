I'm going away
As far as I possibly can
And you wont find me
You will never ever know
How well and good I am
'Cause you don't define me
There's people on this earth who can help me
Without using me
There's people on this earth who can love me
Without abusing me

I don't need you
Like I thought I did
I don't need you
To watch me fall
I don't need you
To make me feel like a lonely kid
I don't need you
At all

We're in the eleventh hour
And I seriously thought that we'd break through
I sat in your kitchen and cried
And underneath my words surged my love for you
I reached out my hand for you daddy
And you just turned your cool blue mind away
It's my birthday and I don't get no well wishes
Just a letter that you got some rent you think I ought to pay

I don't need you
Like I used to do
I don't need you
To save my soul
I don't need you
To make me feel sad and blue
I don't need you
Like I always have
I don't need you
To hope and long for
I don't need you
To make me feel
Mean and bad
I don't need you
anymore
