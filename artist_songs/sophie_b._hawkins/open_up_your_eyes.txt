If I had the moon in a jar
I'd wanna share it with you 
Or the light of a million stars
I'd wanna share it with you
The hidden knowledge to the way things are
I'd love to share that with you
But all I have is my heart

I can't control my feelings
I wanna lay with you nude at night
Open up your eyes and see I've never compromised my spirit
I can't persuade my conscience
I need you whether it's wrong or it's right
I know how to fly I've only
Waited for someone to teach me to steer it

If I could show the world on a screen
I'd wanna share it with you
The life story of every human being
I'd wanna share it with you
The inner mystery of the outer scheme
Oh I'd love I'd Love I'd love to share that with you
But all I have is a dream

I can't control my feelings
I wanna lay with you nude at night
Open up your eyes and see I've never compromised my spirit
I can't persuade my conscience
I need you whether it's wrong or it's right
I know how to fly I've only
Waited for someone to teach me to steer it

If I had a place on the shore
I'd wanna share it with you
Or a backstreet paved in gold
Oh you know I'd share that with you
A time machine and an old riverboat
I'd wanna share it with you
But all I have is my soul
(better turn the lights on the runway)
I wanna lay with you nude at night

Open up your eyes, open up your eyes
open up your eyes darlin'
I wanna lay with you nude tonight
