Sleepy head wake up
Wipe the whiskey from your eyes
Turn and reach for me
Get hit with a surprise
My daddy didn't raise me
To get knocked around by you
Now all I have to show for love are eyes of black and blue

So I'm gone where you will never find me
Gone where I can start again
Gonna leave this lunacy behind me
Be my storie's heroine

Hey your gonna say
how crazy sorry you are
But you can tell your pretty words
to the dust of my car

'Cause I'm gone where you will never find me
Gone where I can start again
Gonna leave this lunacy behind me
Be my storie's heroine
Goin' where the sun's on my back
And my mind is in the wind
Gonna take this dance
Goin' to find a friend

Hit me once, shame on you
Shame on me if I wait for number two
Ain't exactly what you had planned?
Well you shoulda thought of that before you raised your hand
Darlin' times have changed
and a woman don't take her love in chains
Gonna be as free as I wanna be
Got my whole damn life in front of me

Gone where you will never find me
Gone where I can start again
Gonna leave this lunacy behind me
Be my storie's heroine
Goin' where the sun's on my back
And my mind is in the wind
And I'm stronger than I've never been before
