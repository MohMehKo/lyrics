Please take away from me
All these things I do not need
Use me to keep your conscience clean
Show me what to do
To sacrifice for you
I gladly give my life to you
I've wandered far enough to never have given up too much
and now I'm offering you everything I am

Give me your hand
I'm walking on thin ice
And I know you can deliver me
More than good advice
Teach me with your deep love
How to look inside
And not be afraid
To shine

You are my destiny
The path I'm cutting tirelessly
And searching for you endlessly
Even when I'm
Surely in the heart of you
I still persist on collecting proof that
You are never known and though I feel you
I have grown to wonder if I'll ever really understand

Give me your hand
I'm walking on thin ice
And I know you can deliver me
More than good advice
Teach me with your deep love
How to look inside
And not be afraid
To shine
'Cause I've been a fool
Pretending to be free
When all I could do was run away
When the spot light caught me
Heal me with your sweet love
'Cause I do believe
When I open my eyes in front of you
I see

Give me your hand
I'm walking on thin ice
And I know you can deliver me
More than good advice
Teach me with your deep love
How to look inside
And not be afraid
To shine
'Cause I've been a fool
Pretending to be free
When all I could do was run away
When the spot light fell on me
Heal me with your sweet love
'Cause I do believe
When I open my eyes in front of you
It's the truth I see
