You're just a kid, but you got nowhere to go
Just waiting on your heart to call
There is a rumble in the streets of soul
And you don't care at all
Empty holes and empty feelings abound
And everything you got you stole
I'm right behind if you just turn around
I'll never let you fall, no

Go to the ends of the earth
You'll never find a love like me
Take my hand and I will help you see

After the world is frozen
And after the sun goes out
I'll keep you warm, here in my arms
When you think the spell is broken
When you think the magic's gone
I'll be the one to collect all the stars in your heart again, yeah

You want to fight, but you've got nothing show
Just choking on the velvet rope
Those disco lights can leave you feeling so low
But, I will give hope, yes I will

Go to the ends of the earth
And you'll never find a love like me
Stick with me and I will help you see

After the world is frozen
And after the sun goes out
I'll keep you warm, here in my arms
When you think the spell is broken
When you think the magic's gone
I'll be the one, to collect all the stars in your heart again, yeah
I'll be the one to collect all the stars in your heart again

Stick with me and I will help you see...

That after the world is frozen
And after the sun goes out
I'll keep you warm, here in my arms
When you think the spell is broken
When you think the magic's gone
I'll be the one, to collect all the stars in your heart again, yeah

So stick with me
I'll be the one to collect all the stars in your heart (all the stars in your)
Oh yeah
I'll be the one to
Stick with me
I'll be the one to collect all the stars in your heart (all the stars in your)
