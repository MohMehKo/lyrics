I gotta get away from here,
Where its always cold
I wanna warm my soul
Because I'm watching the embers die
Said I'm gonna pack my bags
Gonna leave today
I got no need to stay
Cuz no ones gonna kiss me goodbye

I don't need anybody to lead the way
I got a dream to follow
I don't need anybody to face today becuz
I've got tomorrow
I don't need anybody to break my fall
Because I know that if my journey leads
Me waiting alone
I've got a voice that carries, carries me on up
And gonna carry me down to LA

I said its been ten long years,
Since I've seen the sun
And living on the run
Still hanging my head in shame

When my momma said to speak my mind,
To listen what I say,cuz there will come a day
When everybody screaming my name

I don't need anybody to lead the way
I got a dream to follow
I dont need anybody to face today becuz
I've got tomorrow
I don't need anybody to break my fall
Because I know that if my journey leads
Me waiting alone
I've got a voice that carries,carries me on up
And gonna carry me down to LA

I've got a voice that carries, carries me down
To where the sun don't stop
I've got a voice that carries, carries me
Away from my pain yeaaaa
I've got a voice that carries, carries me down
To where the sand is hot
I've got a voice that carries, thats the only
Thing thats keeping me sane
I've got a voice, can you hear it, calling me,
Up and away
I've got a voice, can you hear it, calling me,
Calling me,calling me down to LA

Never a place to go,or a place to be no..
As long as I can breath,
I'll always have my get away song

I don't need anybody to lead the way
I got a dream to follow
I don't need anybody to face today becuz
I've got tomorrow
I don't need anybody to break my fall
Because I know that if my journey leads
Me waiting alone
I've got a voice that carries, carries me on up
Carries me down to LA
[repeat]

I've got a voice that carries [7x]
