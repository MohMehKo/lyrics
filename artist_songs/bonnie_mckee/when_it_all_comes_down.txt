I knew
She knew
We both knew that someday all of this would end

I tried to help
But all I seem to do is hurt
Not only her but myself

And someday
I'll be on the road again
And someday
I'll meet you at the top my friend
Don't cry, don't cry
Although I know it's hard to comprehend, oh
Don't cry, don't cry

I'll hold your hand if you hold mine
When it all comes down, oh
Don't close your eyes
I'll hold your hand if you'll hold mind
When it all comes down
And take a big deep breath

It feels so empty
Without my hand intwined with yours
I don't know where to go
Cause I'm all alone
Ain't got nobody by my side
You hear me, no one

And someday
I'll be on the road again
And someday
I'll meet you at the top my friend
Don't cry, don't cry
Although I know it's hard to comprehend
Don't cry, don't cry

I'll hold your hand if you hold mine
When it all comes down, oh
Don't close your eyes
I'll hold your hand if you'll hold mine
Yeah when it all comes down
And take a big deep breath

Na na na na na na (when it all comes down I'll be there, there is nothing for you to fear)
Na na na na na na (when it all comes down you'll know you'll never have to stand alone)

I know you're feeling afraid girl
I know you're feeling alone
But when you feel you can't make it on your own, yeah yeah

I'll hold your hand if you'll hold mine
When it all comes down don't close your eyes
I'll hold your hand if you hold mine yeah when it all comes down and take big
Deep breath

Whoa oh yeah oh oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ohhh oooh ooh
