They say youth is wasted, wasted on the young
So they tell me, why are we having so much fun?
All the midnight dreamers falling into love
In our torn up sneakers, yeah, we were born to run

So I'm begging you
Hold on, hold on
To your wasted youth
Hang on, hang on
Cause it's going so soon
So let's get it while we're young
(We're wasted youth)

Yeah, we're bored and jaded
Sharing bubble gum
But these nights are sacred
There's freedom in our blood

Hold on, hold on
To your wasted youth
(We're diamonds in the rough)
Hang on, hang on
Cause it's going so soon
(Let's get it while we're young)
And shine on, cause we'll never be the same
We'll never be the same
(You know you know the truth)
Hold on, hold on
To your wasted youth
Let's get it while we're young
Let's get it while we're young

Let's go
Let's get stupid right now
Get to fooling around
Jump in the pool with you clothes on
Sleep with your shoes and on the futon
Time we got is right now, so we're making it count
Roll down the windows and scream it
Let's get it while we're young

Hold on, hold on
To your wasted youth
(We're diamonds in the rough)
Hang on, hang on
Cause it's going so soon
(Let's get it while we're young)
And shine on, cause we'll never be the same
We'll never be the same
(You know you know the truth)
Hold on, hold on
To your wasted youth
Let's get it while we're young

Ah, ah, ah, ah
We're wasted
Let's get it while we're young
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Let's get it while we're young
Yeah
Let's get it while we're young
Ah, ah, ah, ah
We're wasted, we're wasted
Ah, ah, ah, ah
We're wasted, we're wasted
Ah, ah, ah, ah
We're wasted, we're wasted
