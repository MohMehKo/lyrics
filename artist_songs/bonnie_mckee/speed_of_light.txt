I have been far away
Losing myself in the night
I-I-I, don't know which road to take
Can't tell what's wrong or what's right

I-I-I, I'm ready to go, I'm ready to fly
I can feel the force waking up inside
It's stronger than before, now it's do or die

Living at the speed of light
Dancing with the darkside
With the darkside of my heart
Living at the speed of light
I just wanna shine bright
Like a bright sky full of stars

Sometimes I find myself
Feeding the shadows inside
Why-y-y? I don't want any help
I'm sinking deep in my mind

I-I-I, I'm ready to go, I'm ready to fly
I can feel the force waking up inside
It's stronger than before, now it's do or die

Living at the speed of light
Dancing with the darkside
With the darkside of my heart
Living at the speed of light
I just wanna shine bright
Like a bright sky full of stars

Night after night I've been fighting it
The war that's inside of me
But if I open my eyes I'm defying it
I'm defying gravity

Living at the speed of light
Dancing with the darkside
With the darkside of my heart
Living at the speed of light
I just wanna shine bright
Like a bright sky full of stars
