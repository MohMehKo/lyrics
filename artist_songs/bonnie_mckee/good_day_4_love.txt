Word on the street, you're on your own
Heart's like concrete, sink like a stone
I feel your pain, sharp like a thorn
Don't know your name, want to know more

We can do anything right now
Turn up the music and drown it out
If you came to move tonight
You should know that you're not alone

It's a good day for love, hey
So come and show me some
You're not the only one brokenhearted
It's a good day for love, hey
We're gonna celebrate
Your independence day, join the party
It's a good day for love

Felt like a fool, lost on the map
Life can be cruel, no going back
Love has a cost, you paid the price
Time that you've lost, leave that behind, yeah

We can do anything right now
Turn up the music and drown it out
If you came to move tonight
You should know that you're not alone

It's a good day for love, hey
So come and show me some
You're not the only one brokenhearted
It's a good day for love, hey
We're gonna celebrate
Your independence day, join the party
It's a good day for love

We can do anything right now
Turn up the music and drown it out
If you came to move tonight
You should know that you're not alone

It's a good day for love, hey
So come and show me some
You're not the only one brokenhearted
It's a good day for love, hey
We're gonna celebrate
Your independence day, join the party
It's a good day for love

It's a good day for love
It's a good day for love
