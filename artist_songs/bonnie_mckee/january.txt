You say al though your love for me is strong.
That a lover under seventeen is wrong.
Another night goes by
And I awake enveloped in your arms, yeah
You wont make up your mind.
Because my helplessness turns you on, yeah.
If you leave now baby dont come back,
if your leavin baby dont come back [x2]

[Chorus:]
January's just around the corner
I know that you'll be back by then
I'm counting down the days on my calender,
till lovin me wont be a sin

I thought that after all we've seen and done.
That your battle with morality was won
You've already crossed the line (Crossed the line)
You might as well just wait it out (Yeah)
I havent got the time (Havent got the time)
to be led in and then be shut out Oh no no
If you leave now baby dont come back,
if your leavin baby dont come back [x2]

[Chorus:]
January's just around the corner
I know that you'll be back by then
I'm counting down the days on my calender,
till lovin me wont be a sin

I dont want you to leave but I need you to know,
that I can only take so much of all your come and go
Just stick around and there'll be no more reason for concern,
because your baby will be legal when the season turns cause

[Chorus:]
January's just around the corner
I know that you'll be back by then
I'm counting down the days on my calender,
till lovin me wont be a sin [x2] oh ohh

Yeah oh. oohh, oh, ooh, Ahh ahh ahh [x2]
