You were so quiet 
I was so cold
You were the only one who saw that side of me
I was so anxious, raring to go
But I never thought I'd have to compete
But baby if that game is on
I guess I'll have to play along

Cause you're mine
You belong to me
Even if I sang goodbye
You'll always be my property
And I won't lie
It hurts to watch you look at her that way
Can't help but wonder if she's better
if she's better than me
And how we used to be

It couldn't of lasted
We were so wrong
I don't even miss how soft and warm you used to be
Now you are so happy
Now that I'm gone
But you wouldn't be the man you are without me
I may have let you go but I just have to let you know

That your mine
You belong to me
Even if I said goodbye
You'll always be my property
And I won't lie
It hurts to see you look at her that way
Can't help but wonder if she's better
Is she better?

And I am trying to believe
You're kissing her
You're missing me
I'm all over you boy 
But you still want shotgun
You can deny but you know it's true
I'll always own a part of you
But I can't let go
Run as far as you can get
But I will not let you forget

You belong to me [x2]

Because you're mine
You belong to me
Even if I said goodbye
You still mean the world to me
And I won't lie
It hurts to see you look at her that way

Oh oh it hurts to say goodbye, yeah [x2]
