I told I would be there for you
A promise I intend to keep
But the subject matter here is a little too close to home
And now I can't take back what I gave

All the times we've seen
All the states we've been in
You always saved me from my troubled self it seemed
But now Im hearing all these words you say
And Im not sure if I can stay
And listen to you melting all my dreams

Baby its you that kept my feet on the ground
Thought that I could choose if I always wanted you around
Darling I do
Think we need time apart
I still need time to mend my broken seams

I told you I would listen to you
So Im all ears
But dont ask me respond
Your pleas for my advice
Cause now im too burdened to speak

Baby its you that kept my feet on the ground
Thought that I could choose if I always wanted you around
Darling i do
Think we need time apart
I think the time has come for me to go

Oh, I cant be by myself
But there is no one else
And well it hurts to know someone else tastes your lips
But I can not forget how hard I cried
When I discovered you had lied
When you said I could never hurt like this

Baby its you that kept my feet on the ground
Thought that I could choose if I always wanted you around
Darling its hard to think that we need time apart
And I think the time has come for me to go

Cause Im weary
Im so weary
I told you
I'd be there
I'm broken
I'm so broken
But im here
It's painful
It's so painful
I'd told you
I'd believe
But these are secrets I can not afford to hear
These are secrets I can not afford to hear
