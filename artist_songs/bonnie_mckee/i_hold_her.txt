Smokey is my apple
And green are my eyes
Silent is snowfall
I whispher goodbye
Farewell to the child
That I use to be
I hold her she's sobbing
My baby...

The wolf and the lion
Have asked me to play
Though she told me not to
I went anyway
A pile of matches
The truth at my feet
I hold her she's sobbing
My baby...

The cream in my tea
Spells out something to me
And they say 
That I'll heal by the day
But, the message I give
Kills off all will to live
I'm afriad that I'm losing my way

Burning in heaven
My destiny lies
When she read my stars
She didn't mention that night
I loved you, my Bambi
I don't want to leave
But, I hold her she's sobbing 
My baby...

I hold her she's sobbing
I hold her she's sobbing
I hold her she's sobbing
My baby...
