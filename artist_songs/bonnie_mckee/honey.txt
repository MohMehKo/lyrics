Memories haunting my evenings,
Eyes watching me through the moon
I hope my good days aren't over
Not so soon....
I never have seen an angel
I gave up watching the sky
Whisper softly to me honey
But don't lie,don't you lie

I still see you when my eyes are closed
And tell me why I can't let go
I still smell you inside of my clothes
Oh, honey

Someday I'll go for the glory
I'll conquer everyones fears and
For once the ending of the story won't be tears
I have seen to much betrayel
I have heard to many lies
Someday I'll be purple lightening in the skys

I still see you when my eyes are closed
And tell me why I can't let you go
I still smell you inside of my clothes
Oh, honey...
I can't love anybody but you, oh, honey...

I was alone, I was broken ehh
I needed someone to love
Your love was sticky like honey
Your love was sticky like honey
I said your love was sticky like honey

I still see you when my eyes are closed
And tell me why I can't let go
I still smell you inside of my clothes
Oh, honey... woooo oyea

I can't love anybody but you,I'm afraid
Yea but I know its true
I can't find no one sweeter then you
Oh, honey........
See you, fell you,touch you,,,can't let go of you
Honey...
