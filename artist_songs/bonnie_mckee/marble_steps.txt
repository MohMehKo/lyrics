I climb the marble stairs that lead away
Away from everything I used to know
I try to keep my eyes down on the way
A way my mother told me not to go

Well all I wanted was a hand to hold me down
To keep the sky from swallowing me up
And all I ever needed was someone to come around
And tell me that I suffered long enough

So take me away
Find me a home
Im on my way
Im on my way

I wonder when I'll see the stars again
I thought they had faded long ago
With every step Im closer to the end
Im climbing cause I don't know where to go 

Well all I ever wanted was a place to store my faith
I thought that I could keep it locked away
It burns my eyes to look at him
And see the truth inside
And so Ive turned my broken face away

So take me away
Find me a home
Im on my way
Im on my way

I always dreamed of Sundays together with you
Only your echos can break my heart 
I need a hand to hold me 
To keep me on land
I feel i am drifting through _

Well all I ever wanted was a hand to hold me down
To keep the sky from swallowing me up
And all I ever needed for someone to come around 
And tell me that I've suffered long enough

Take me away
Find me a home
Im on my way
Im on my way
Im on my way
Im on my way
You know Im gone
Im gone
Im on my way 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Yeah yeah oh oh
