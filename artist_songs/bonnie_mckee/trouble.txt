Ah yes
I remember too well
How hard
I tried avoiding your spell
It was a cold October night
It was a far from sober night
And I was taken at first sight
And this was much to your delight

I'd heard
That you were looking for prey
Hungry for a different girl everyday
But you were so sly in coming in
I wouldn't fight, I let you win.
All of the blood upon your chin
Told me exactly where you'd been

Who would have thought I'd ever let somebody get to me
Who would have thought I'd ever give a damn
I gave to you the one thing that I can never retrieve
And I am leaving my heart bleeding in my hands

You told me all about your dreams
You were so deep,
Or so it seemed
Although I'm young, I'm not naive
I am not easy to deceive

I see the danger that lies beyond your eyes
And I wanna scream when you're rubbing on my thighs
I know I should but I can't say no, I won't.
Troublemaker, gotta let you go, ooh
Trouble trouble
Troublemaker

Who woulda thought I'd ever let somebody get to me
Who woulda thought I'd ever give a damn
I gave to you the one thing that I can never retrieve
And you're leaving my heart bleeding in my hands

I thought I knew you well
I thought you'd catch me if I fell
But when I fell you never came
That's when I knew this was a game

I thought, Because I knew that I'd won
But honey, that's easier said than done
Cuz I lose my breath when you're kissin' on my neck
Boy you've got me in check, but I haven't lost yet
Trouble Trouble
Trouble maker
Don't you bring it round here
