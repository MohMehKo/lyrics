Hot kiss on a Saturday night
One wish under neon light
So good that it's out of control
One look and we're ready to go
Ready to go, ready to go
One look and I'm ready to go
Ready to go, ready to go (go, go)

I wanna call you
So take my phone away
Cause even if I want to
I know I'll get away
I wanna know
Is it a mistake, dialing your name
But it's such a shame
Because I wanna call you
I don't wanna wait

I wanna know

Round ice, oh, you're thinkin' of me
That night, on the washing machine
A rough draft that it'll never get end
I just wanna do it again
Do it again, do it again
I just wanna do it again
Do it again, do it again

I wanna call you
So take my phone away
Cause even if I want to
I know I'll get away
I wanna know
Is it a mistake, dialing your name
But it's such a shame
Because I wanna call you
I don't wanna wait

I wanna know

So, I'm going with it
I wanna see your move
Come on and keep the teasing
But don't call me up too son
Cause baby if you
You're making it too easy

I wanna call you
So take my phone away
Cause even if I want to
I know I'll get away
I wanna know
Is it a mistake, dialing your name
But it's such a shame
Because I wanna call you
I don't wanna wait

I wanna know
