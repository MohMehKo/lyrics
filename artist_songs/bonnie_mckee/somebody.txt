I sit alone
Dark theatre, watchin' the people go by
Hand in hand
Everybody but me
Oh

I stay behind
Watchin' the credits roll by
Roll roll roll right by me

I know, I won't cry
Cause there is somebody somebody somebody waitin' for me
Out in the rain

Won't cry
Not tonight
Because there is somebody waitin' for me
Oh yeah

I take a walk
The streets are busy tonight
And I am searching for you
Waiting to brush your shoulder
But I'm alone
I watch the faces roll by
Roll roll roll right by me

But I know, I won't cry
Cause' there's somebody somebody somebody waitin' for me
Out in the rain

Won't cry
Not tonight
Because there is somebody waitin' for me

How many words will go unspoken
'Til I hear knockin' upon my door
Losing track of the nights I spent heart broken
But tonight I know
I won't cry no more
Oh

I lie awake
I left the porch light on
I hope it helps you to find your way
Outside
I hear the thunder roll by
Roll roll roll right by me

But I know, I won't cry
Cause' there is somebody somebody somebody waitin' for me
Out in the rain
Not gonna cry tonight
No cause there is somebody waitin' for me
Not gonna cry tonight
No
No no no no
Oh
Not gonna cry
Not tonight cause there is somebody waitin' for me

I stay behind
Watchin' the credits roll by
Roll roll roll right by me
