Hey boy when you come around I misbehave boy
Can you feel my temperature rise?
How do you do this to me?
Hey!

You know it's so tough
Because you know I like to play rough
Always try to rile me up
Boy why you wanna test me?

Something about you
Makes me wanna do things
That I would never do
(What's gotten into me?)
(What's gotten into me?)
Feeling like BONNIE and Clyde
Putting it all on the line
(What's gotten into me?)
(What's gotten into me?)

You bring out the worst in me
It must be something in the chemistry
You got me tripping baby
You bring out the worst in me boy
Hey!
Now I've got a thirst in me
I don't know why cause it's a first for me
When we're together baby
You bring out the worst in me, boy
Hey!

I know I should know better than to indulge
Every time I do you bring me down down down into the fire with you
I guess this friction is just exactly what's so tempting
Say you need a partner in crime, boy
Give me the destruction

Something about us
Is tearing me up
But I just can't get enough
(What's gotten into me?)
(What's gotten into me?)
Feeling like BONNIE and Clyde
Putting it all on the line
(What's gotten into me?)
(What's gotten into me?)

You bring out the worst in me
It must be something in the chemistry
You got me tripping baby
You bring out the worst in me boy
Hey!
Now I've got a thirst in me
I don't know why cause it's a first for me
When we're together baby
You bring out the worst in me, boy
Hey!

Cause I've never been that girl
Creepin' on my flo(or) on the low got me steaming up the windows
I don't know what's gotten into me

You bring out the worst in me
It must be something in the chemistry
You got me tripping baby
You bring out the worst in me boy
Hey!
Now I've got a thirst in me
I don't know why cause it's a first for me
When we're together baby
You bring out the worst in me, boy
Hey!
