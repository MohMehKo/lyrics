I, I would make a deal with the devil
Turn my heart into metal
Just to get to you
Baby, I would slink to your level
Put my foot on the pedal
Just to get to you, wow

I'll give you my soul to keep
The golden key, forever
Yeah, if you rock the road with me
Then we can be together, yeah

I want your touch
I want your kiss
I want tough love, ah
I want it all
I want your fear
I want your life
I want your mind
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I want it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I want it all

Yeah you know I wanna cut like a razor
Sign in blood on the paper
Just to get to you
I would yell like a rebel
Take the pain with the pleasure
Just to get to you

I'll give you my soul to keep
The golden key, forever
Yeah, if you rock the road with me
Then we can be together, yeah

I want your touch
I want your kiss
I want tough love, ah
I want it all
I want your fear
I want your life
I want your mind
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I want it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I want it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I want it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I want you down on your knees tonight
Bring your dreams to life
I need you to long for me
To belong to me
I want you down on your knees tonight
Bring your dreams to life
I need you to, need you to long for me
To belong to me


I want your touch
I want your kiss
I want tough love, ah
I want it all
I want your fear
I want your life
I want your mind
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I want it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I want it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I want it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
