I'm on a mission to search and destroy
Don't get it twisted I'm ready to make some noise
Thought you could play me just like a Nintendo
But don't you know that I'm loco

I came to win, win, win better show me what you got
I came to bring the fire cause you know I like it hot
Gonna win, win, win cause I'm full of tiger blood
I'm vicious like a viper, and I'm ready to turn it on

Work hard and so we play hard
You wanna go

You know I'm bringing bombastic
I'm feeling fucking fantastic
Turn up the music yeah blast it
You know I'm playing like, no more Mr. Nice Guy

You know I'm bringing bombastic
I'm feeling fucking fantastic
Turn up the music yeah blast it
You know I'm playing like, no more Mr. Nice Guy
I'm coming for you

You got me revving like a Lamborghini
I got you sweating yeah victory tastes so sweet
I know you heard about my reputation
You gonna need a vacation

I came to win, win, win better show me what you got
I came to bring the fire cause you know I like it hot
Gonna win, win, win cause I'm full of tiger blood
I'm vicious like a viper, and I'm ready to turn it on

Work hard and so we play hard
You wanna go

You know I'm bringing bombastic
I'm feeling fucking fantastic
Turn up the music yeah blast it
You know I'm playing like, no more Mr. Nice Guy

Work hard, work hard, work hard
Work hard, work hard, work hard

You know I'm bringing bombastic
I'm feeling fucking fantastic
Turn up the music yeah blast it
You know I'm playing like, no more Mr. Nice Guy

No more Mr. Nice Guy
