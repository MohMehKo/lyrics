I've been stuck in the dark
Stumbling around reaching out for my heart
Wondering just how I allowed you to turn the light out inside of me
You've got tricks up your sleeve
And got the power to keep me intrigued
Well I guess I should have known
I guess I should have seen
That you would pull the love right from underneath

Under your love spell
I'm just trying to forget you
But nobody compares nobody even close baby
You got that logic I need and it's holding me hostage
And now I've just become prisoner to your love baby
Well I'm trying to let go 
But I don't know how
Won't you set me free give me the remedy
For this love spell

Love spell

Should have heard what they said
When they told me I end up caught in your web
I thought that I was strong
Don't know what went wrong
But now I'm frozen in your captivity

Under your love spell
I'm just trying to forget you
But nobody compares nobody even close baby
You got that logic I need and it's holding me hostage
And now I've just become prisoner to your love baby
Well I'm trying to let go 
But I don't know how
Won't set me free I need a remedy

From this love spell that you cast over me
I can't speak
I can't see
I've been poisoned with romance
And it's cruel cause you know what your doing
When you cast this illusion, that I stand a chance
But I'm just standing...

Under your love spell
I'm just trying to forget you
But nobody compares nobody even close 
You got that logic I need 
And I can't let go
Won't you set me free
I need a remedy
For this love spell
Love spell
Love spell
Please set me free
