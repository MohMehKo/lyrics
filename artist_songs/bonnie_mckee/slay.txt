Welcome to the part of the show
Where we fake it 'til we make it
Living in the shadow is cold
Want to burn bright like the sunrise
I close my eyes and dream in technicolor
I'm not the only one
I'm reaching for the glory from the gutter
I'll show them how it's done

C'mon everybody let's go!
We can do anything
It don't matter what people think
We'll keep slaying like 1999
C'mon everybody let's go!
Baby we're bright as gold
It don't matter what you've been told
We'll keep slaying it 'til the day we die
C'mon everybody let's-
S - L - A - Y
S - L - A - Y

Once upon a time you believed in tomorrow
In the cosmos
But then you didn't land on your feet
In the jungle, better hustle
Because I close my eyes and dream in technicolor
I'm not the only one
I'm reaching for the glory from the gutter
I'll show them how it's done

C'mon everybody let's go!
We can do anything
It don't matter what people think
We'll keep slaying like 1999
C'mon everybody let's go!
Baby we're bright as gold
It don't matter what you've been told
We'll keep slaying it 'til the day we die
C'mon everybody let's-
S - L - A - Y
S - L - A - Y

Tonight you and I
We can chop like razorblades
Line 'em up and go all the way
That's right, you and I
We'll forget our yesterdays
Line 'em up and go all the way

We can do anything
It don't matter what people think
We'll keep slaying like 1999
C'mon everybody let's go!

It don't matter what you've been told
We'll keep slaying it 'til the day we die
C'mon everybody let's-
S - L - A - Y
S - L - A - Y
