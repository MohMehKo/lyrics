I'm just a girl
With good intentions
I don't cry to get attention
Most of the time

I'm just a girl
I do some damage
I use my gender, to my advantage
Is this a crime
If there is a time, I have a need and alibi
I don't have to try, its built in
It comes with the package ahhhhhh
Along with sugar and spice and everything nice
The power I posses to entice
Its built in
It comes with the package ahhhhhhh

Thats why I love being a teenage girl
Feeling confined where I fit in the world
I'm in bloom, I'm in bloom
And if ever I'm caught doing what I should not
They'll assume, I'm an innocent girl

I'm just a girl
I keep my promise
I won't bite
Completely harmless, most of the time

I'm just a girl
My wrath is tender
Bat my eyes
In the surrender
Is this a crime
If there is a time I have a need and alibi
I don't have to try, its built in
It comes with the package ahhhhhhhh
Along with sugar and spice and everything nice
The power I posses to entice
Its built in, it comes with the package ahhhhhh

Thats why I love being a teenage girl
Feeling confined where I fit in the world
I'm in bloom. I'm in bloom
And if ever I'm caught doing what I should not
They'll assume I'm an innocent girl
