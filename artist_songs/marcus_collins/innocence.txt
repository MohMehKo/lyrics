I remember when we were so young
Life was just a game and we were always on the run
We were just two crazy vagabonds
Always in and out of trouble but we meant nobody harm

But everything is changed now we grew too fast
You are talking so strange now
How did we lose our innocence?
Whatever happened to that innocence we used to know?
Innocence I wish that we could bring it back again just like before
Uuuuuuuuuuu Innocence

I remember times when love was all all we ever had to give us
Shelter from the storm we ran these streets together side by side
Now we are face to face there is only anger in your eyes

Cause everything has changed now we grew too fast
You are talking so strange now
How did we lose our innocence?
Whatever happened to that innocence we used to know?
Innocence I wish that we could bring it back again just like before
Uuuuuuuuuuu Innocence

Tell me please am I going crazy was it just a dream
Am I rewriting pages of our history
Cause I thought it was always about you and me 
You and me 

Uuuuuuuuuuu Innocence
Whatever happened to that innocence we used to know?
Innocence I wish that we could bring it back again just like before
Uuuuuuuuuuu Innocence
Whatever happened to that innocence we used to know?
Innocence I wish that we could bring it back again just like before
Uuuuuuuuuuu Innocence
