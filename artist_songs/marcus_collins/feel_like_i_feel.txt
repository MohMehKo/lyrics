Ohh 
Now here's a question 
why do you walk away 
and I've good and I've reason to stay 
I never learned my lesson 
are you lying to me 
are you fool to believe you take me for granted 
so much that I can't stand it 
wish I was strong enough to let with you 

[Chorus:]
I don't know why I feel like I feel 
'cause you're doing me wrong 
turn my back and you're gone, and you're gone 
if only I have a heart made it still 
'cause I don't understand why you I feel the way I feel 

So tell em baby 
I'ma feel justify 
is just somebody else on the side 
[?] was made it [?] know where I stand and now I'm [?]
you're only intentions my promises and wake up 
I could go on but there's too much demention 

[Chorus:]
I don't know why I feel like I feel 
'cause you're doing me wrong 
turn my back and you're gone, and you're gone 
if only I have a heart made it still 
'cause I don't understand why you I feel the way I feel 

I gotta get back to my life 
finally leave this love behind 
sometimes the truth is so hard to find ohh 

[2x Chorus:]
