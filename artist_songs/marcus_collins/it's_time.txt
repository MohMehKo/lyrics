Oh, oh, oh, oh
Buried my head, and all my dreams in the sand
Me and my heart, we got to make other plans,
That's just what I'm gonna do!
Yeah baby, baby!
That's just what I'm gonna do!

Packing the suitcase I keep moving now
Can't find this heaving heart that keeps weighing down
That's just what I'm gonna do, oh
Until I stop missing you!

[Chorus:]
It's time, it's time to get a little bit,
Get a little bit stronger
Now I, I'm moving on
Just pack it up in a bag, cause I ain't coming back
Oh, oh, it's time, it's time for good!
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I slurred my sentence for you,
Cause I'm a free man!
To seek redemption like I'm out of Shawshank
I washed you out of my head now, baby, baby
It's time to check out of here

[Chorus:]
It's time, it's time to get a little bit,
Get a little bit stronger
Now I, I'm moving on
Just pack it up in a bag, cause I ain't coming back
Oh, oh, it's time, it's time for good!
Oh, oh, oh, oh

And I'm not saying that walking away don't take bitter sweet, bitter sweet, alright!
Cause after loving you all this time
I can't lie, it's killing me, killing me!
It's gonna take some time to get over you
Cause now is no one like, I know the truth!

[Chorus:]
It's time, it's time to get a little bit,
Get a little bit stronger
Now I, I'm moving on
Just pack it up in a bag, cause I ain't coming back
Oh, oh, it's time, it's time for good!
Oh, oh, oh, oh
