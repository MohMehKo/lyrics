I got so tired of these dramas
So take a round of applause
you should be winning an Oscar
And still I come back for more
We can't seem to live without it
There's nothing we can do about it
So tired of these dramas
Still I can't walk away

Nobody said it was easy, 
Sometimes we cross the line between love and hate
We say that we're sorry
And then we go right back and do it all again
We fuss and we fight, trying to make it alright
Living on the line between love and hate
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh love and hate

You know you kill me with kindness
But you still push me away
Do you know you're bind to the madness
Don't hear a word that I say
I try so hard no to be around you
But there's emptiness when I'm without you
So tired of these dramas
Still I can't walk away

Nobody said it was easy, 
Sometimes we cross the line between love and hate
We say that we're sorry
And then we go right back and do it all again
We fuss and we fight, trying to make it alright
Living on the line between love and hate
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh love and hate

How many times can we start again?
Try and try so hard but we never change
Cause you and me, I just can't explain
But don't say it's too late, it's only love and hate

Love and hate, yeah, love and hate

Nobody said it was easy, 
Sometimes we cross the line between love and hate
We say that we're sorry
And then we go right back and do it all again
We fuss and we fight, trying to make it alright
Living on the line between love and hate
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh love and hate

Love and hate, oh oh oh oh oh 
Love and hate.
