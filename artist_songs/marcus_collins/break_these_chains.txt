Feels like I hit my head yesterday
Tired of the Games you play
Feels like we've been hear before
Cant even find the right words to say
Back and forward everyday
Don't even know what were fighting for
Leave you love by the door
You have taken what you came here for
Now its time for me to walk away.

Cos
I'm getting ready
I'm getting ready
Yes I'm ready to break these chains..
I'm getting ready
Yes I'm ready
My heart is ready to break these chains on you

You Let me down everytime
you said you were a Friend of mine
The smoke is clearing I can see right through.. (Right Through)
Cant say I never tried
Take a guess in all your lies
Now I'm gone your gonna have to face the truth (face the truth)
Left your love by the door I'm not gonna say no moreÂ 
The rain is gone so I can walk away...

I'm getting ready
I'm getting ready
My hearts ready to break these chains..
I'm getting ready
Yes I'm ready
My hearts ready to break these chains from you

I'm gonna break these chains away from you
Your stupid heart has been a fool
And there were playing games
But my love has changed
My broken heart is gonna walk away

Cos I'm ready
I'm ready
My hearts ready to break these chains
I'm ready
Yes I'm ready
My hearts ready to break these chains from you
I'm getting ready
I'm getting ready
My hearts ready to break these chains
I'm getting ready
Yes I'm ready to break these chains from youuu
