If I stand little bit taller with this scarf over my shoulder
Would it change your mind or is it still over
Cause I am not sure how long I will take to recover
I know sometimes we fall we fight we cry
But when you say goodbye I found it hard to see

I am flying to my knees but I just can’t surrender
I know sometime is hard but we can make it better
We should waited just a little more time
So baby give me just a little more time
Cause way you are going to [?] there will be an a answer
So baby don’t surrender

Broke down what I thought it was forever
And this times are hard guess I should have been wiser
I know sometimes we fall we fight we cry
But when you say goodbye I found it hard to see

I am flying to my knees but I just can’t surrender
I know sometime is hard but we can make it better
We should waited just a little more time
So baby give me just a little more time
Cause way you are going to [?] there will be an a answer
So baby don’t surrender

Can take another day you and me this way since you have been gone
I won’t cry no more tears wish I could be right here with me

Cause I am falling to my knees but I just can’t surrender
I know sometimes is hard but we can make it better
Better
We should waited just a little more time
So baby give me just a little more time
Cause way you are going to [?] there will be an a answer
So baby don’t surrender
