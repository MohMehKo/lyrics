You got me working on your love
It keeps me up in the night
You know I ain't be sleeping
Don't care what time of day as long as you're holding me tight, yeah
I'm so infatuated, got me spinning out of control, yeah, ah
Tell, tell me baby, tell me if you love me so
If you don't want me baby, release me, let me go!

[Chorus]
Mercy, mercy, your loving is the sweetest thing
Crazy, crazy, you got me hanging on a string
Save me, save me, loving you like this is the sweetest thing
Sweetest thing, sweetest thing, oh yeah

I play the part, show my cards
Now there ain't nothing left, no, no
Cause needing you is like a melody that's stuck in my head
Whoa, tell, tell me baby, tell me if you love me so
If you don't want me baby, release me, let me go!

[Chorus]
Mercy, mercy, your loving is the sweetest thing
Crazy, crazy, you got me hanging on a string
Save me, save me, loving you like this is the sweetest thing
Sweetest thing, sweetest thing, oh yeah

You work me like no other (like no other baby)
Can you feel it? It's getting stronger now
Take me, take me over
I can't hold, any longer, whoa
Here we go,

[Chorus]
Mercy, mercy, your loving is the sweetest thing
Crazy, crazy, you got me hanging on a string
Save me, save me, loving you like this is the sweetest thing
Loving you like this is the sweetest thing,
Loving you like this is the sweetest thing, let me tell you
