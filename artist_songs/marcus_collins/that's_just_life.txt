Do do do do, do do do, do do do
Do do do do, do do do, do do do

You think you've worked it out then you see it fall apart
One day it's heaven, then you're picking up the pieces
Of your heart,
You said you'd be there through fire and rain
But now you're gone, won't make the same mistakes again
But that's just life, can make you laugh and make you cry
I've seen both sides, the bitter and the sweet
I guess sometimes, you can't have everything you need
I thought that you were there for me, but that's just life

Do do do do, do do do, do do do
Do do do do, do do do, do do do
Do do do do, do do do, do do do
Do do do do, do do do, do do do

Don't want to jump right in, 
For the fear of getting burned
But another broken heart that leaves a scar is just
Another lesson learned
I want to thank you for making me this strong
'Cause now you're gone I know something 
Better will come along,
But that's just life, can make you laugh and make you cry
I've seen both sides, the bitter and the sweet
I guess sometimes, you can't have everything you need
I thought that you were there for me, but that's just life
When it gets too much to handle I won't cry
And when the world seems against us hold on tight
That's just life

Do do do do, do do do, do do do
Do do do do, do do do, do do do
Do do do do, do do do, do do do
Do do do do, do do do, do do do

But that's just life, can make you laugh and make you cry
I've seen both sides, the bitter and the sweet
I guess sometimes, you can't have everything you need
I thought that you were there for me, but that's just life

Do do do do, do do do, do do do
Do do do do, do do do, do do do
Do do do do, do do do, do do do
Do do do do, do do do, do do do

But that's just life
But that's just life
Do do do do, do do do, do do do
Do do do do, do do do, do do do.
