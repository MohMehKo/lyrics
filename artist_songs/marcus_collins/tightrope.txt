Ohh, another day yeah 
I take your pain away 
here we go oww

Some people talk about you 
like they know all about you 
and when you're down they doubt ya 
and when you tip on 
the scence, yeah they talkin bout it 
'cause they can't tip on 
the scene with ya 
talkin bout it 
T- t-t-ttalk about it, 
when you get elevated, 
they love it or they hate it 
you dance up on them 
haters, keep getting funky on the scence
while they jumpin round ya 
they tryin to take all your dreams
but you can't allow it, 

[Chorus:]
Cause baby whether you're high or low
baby whether you're high or low 
you gotta tip on the tightrope, 
T-t-t-tip on the tightrope 
Baby, baby whether you're high or low 
baby whether you're high or low 
you gotta tip on the tightrope,
now let me see you do the tightrope 

And I'm still tippin on it 
see I'm not walkin on it 
or trying to run around it 
this ain't no acrobatics
you either follow or you lead, yeah 
I'm talking bout you, 
I'll keep on blaming the machine, yeah 
yeah I'm talking bout it, 
T-t-t-talkin bout it, 
I can't complain bout it
I gotta keep my balance, 
and just keep dancing on it 
we getting funky on the scene
yeah you know about it, 
liek a star on the screen, 
watch me tip all on it 

[Chorus:]
Then baby whether you're high or low
baby whether you're high or low 
you gotta tip on the tightrope, 
T-t-t-tip on the tightrope 
Baby, baby whether you're high or low 
baby whether you're high or low 
you gotta tip on the tightrope,
now let me see you do the tightrope

I tip on alligators and little rattle snakers, 
but I'm another flavour
something like a terminator, 
ain't no equivocating 
I fight for what I believe
why you talkin bout it, 
he talkin bout it, 
some call me a sinner
some call me a winner 
I'm calling you the dinner 
and you know exactly what I men 
yeah I'm talkin bout you 
yeah you can rock or you can leave 
watch me tip without you 

[Chorus:]
Now whether you're high or low
whether you're high or low 
you gotta tip on the tightrope, 
T-t-t-tip on the tightrope 
Baby, baby whether you're high or low 
whether you're high or low 
you gotta tip on the tightrope,
you gotta tip on the tightrope

[2x]
Then baby whether you're high or low
baby whether you're high or low 
you gotta tip on the tightrope, 
T-t-t-tip on the tightrope 
Baby, baby whether you're high or low 
baby whether you're high or low 
you gotta tip on the tightrope,
now let me see you do the tightrope
