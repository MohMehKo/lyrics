Someone took your truth and lied to it
Someone stole your youth and tried to expose
Your sweet innocence all too soon
Like the shadow of a thief breaking in every night
The scene in sharp relief every time you close your eyes, you still see it
It follows you

So you don't have to be quiet
You don't have to feel ashamed
This is not your war to fight and you're not to blame
Coz I know you've been stumbling
Searching for a place to hide and heal
Somewhere you can rest, forgive yourself and feel
You're safe here, you're safe here

Someone took my rights and treated me wrong
Someone stole my lights but I am still strong
In silent ways that they don't see

So we don't have to be quiet
And we don't have to feel ashamed
This is not our war to fight and you're not to blame
Coz I know you've been stumbling
Searching for a place to hide and heal
Somewhere you can rest, forgive yourself and feel
You're safe here, you're safe here
You're safe here, you're safe here

You are not what happened to you
You are not what happened to you
You are not what happened to you

You are not what happened to you
You are not what happened to you
You are not what happened to you

So you don't have to be quiet
You don't have to feel ashamed
This is not your war to fight and you're not to blame
Coz I know you've been stumbling
Searching for a place to hide and heal
Somewhere you can rest, forgive yourself and feel
You're safe here, you're safe here
