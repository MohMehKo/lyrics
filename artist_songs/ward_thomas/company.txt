There are times when the day is finished with me
My mind, plays the conversations that we
Had then, when nothing seemed to be too pressing
Everything is just easy

I made a list from memory of all the things you've done for me
And every word a discovery, reflecting back what you mean to me
So I'll take my words and I'll keep 'em safe - rest assure I'll appreciate that

I just wanna be in your company
I just really need your company
I just wanna be in your company

It's been said that blood runs thicker than water
I've read absence makes the heard grow fonder
In my head, reasons just keep getting stronger
Everything should be this easy

I remember times you made me laugh, and told a joke on my behalf
You're so in tune with what's going on, I had to put it down in song
It's not every day you find a friend with an open door and an ear to bend

I just wanna be in your company
I just really need your company
I just wanna be in your company

People with forget what you did and
People will forget what you said
But they never forget the way that you make them feel

I made a list from memory of all the things you've done for me
And every word a discovery, reflecting back what you mean to me
So I'll take my words and I'll keep 'em safe - rest assure I'll appreciate that

I just wanna be in your company
I just really need your company
I just wanna be in your company
