I saw them trying not to let the fire fade
Burning effigies of every vow they made
I didn't see love, couldn't believe love
I added up a million ways it could go wrong
I gathered evidence for staying on my own
I didn't see love, at least not real love

[Chorus:]
Here's proof, a shining revelation
Here's you, rewriting the equation
When you blew my doubt out of the water
Showed my heart a love that's true
A solid declaration proof

I wear it proudly now I stitched it on my sleeve
The way you turned me round and taught me how to be
In a real love, I finally feel love

[Chorus]

A solid declaration
Proof, what a revelation
You worth all of my waiting
When you blew my doubt out of the water
Showed my heart a love that's true
A solid declaration

[Chorus]
