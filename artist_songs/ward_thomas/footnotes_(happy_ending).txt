Looking around in the big bad city
What's going on around me
What are they thinking
Where are they going in life

Take a snapshot of my imagination
Where do you fit in
What are you thinking
Where are you going tonight

Well I'm sitting here wondering
Where will I go now
Trying to figure everything out
The puzzles of this town
The footnotes in the story of my life
Help me write my happy ending
Help me get my happy ending right

Fly a plane to the sky
take a birds eye view
see the world from somewhere blue
what are we thinking
where are we going to fly

Do you believe in the things you see
Believe that they were meant to be
Is there a story
Is there an ending to write

Well I'm sitting here wondering
Where will I go now
Trying to figure everything out
The puzzles of this town
The footnotes in the story of my life
Help me write my happy ending
Help me get my happy ending right

The sun just looks the same to everyone
It shines down on the story that we've just begun
But the ending is not the same for everyone
That's not for them to choose

Well I'm sitting here wondering
Where will I go now
Trying to figure everything out
The puzzles of this town
Footnotes in the story of my life help me get my happy ending
Help me get my happy ending right
