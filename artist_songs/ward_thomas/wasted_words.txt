If I came knocking at your door
Would you let me in
Would you hear me out

Should we go over this once more
I understand enough's been said
But I still need to get this out

Oh wasted words
That were never meant to mean that much
And never meant to lead us to this place
I guess I never knew
That these feelings were inside of you
A secret shadow follows
And reveals what you don't show
I'll be there to follow where you go

I can't defend the way I feel
I just pretend that it's for real
As it lies heavy on my mind
And when the tables have been turned it always feels like I've just learned
They're feelings better left behind

Oh wasted words
That were never meant to mean that much
And never meant to lead us to this place
I guess I never knew
That these feelings were inside of you
A secret shadow follows
And reveals what you don't show
I'll be there to follow where you go

I can't build a perfect world
Though I sometimes try
To act the simple girl
And if you'd only hold my hand
It will take me back to where it all began

Oh wasted words
That were never meant to mean that much
And never meant to lead us to this place
I guess I never knew
That these feelings were inside of you
A secret shadow follows
And reveals what you don't show
I'll be there to follow where you go
