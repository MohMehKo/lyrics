My heart strings pulling like elastic bands
I know I should walk away from you
But boy you got me something like a boomerang
I keep on coming back to you
Though I try and I try to forget you
There's a feeling I can't cut loose
And I'm trying my best to move forward
But I keep on coming back to you

There are some times that I kinda wish that you and I were still strangers
Coz I would be blind to the way you always take my breath away

[Chorus:]
It's like one step forward takes me two steps back
No matter what I try to do
Coz boy you got me spinning like a boomerang
I keep on coming back to you
I said I keep on coming back to you

I could count on my hands all the reasons
I should go but it's just no good
Yeah I feel like a yo yo that's reeling
I just keep on coming back to you

There are some times I kinda wish that you and I were still strangers
Coz I would be blind to the way you take my breath away
I try to break but I ricochet

[Chorus]

[Chorus x2]
