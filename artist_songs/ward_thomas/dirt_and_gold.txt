You have this funny way of making
The darkness in a situation take flight, and feel right
You have this brilliant way of showing
Your kindness and you don't even know it's so bright, a gold mine
How do you do what you do

[Chorus:]
You're on a crowded city pavement flooded with rain
You see a slick dance floor and it's calling your name, hey, oh yeah
To you there's no such thing as a dead end street
It's all a valid part of how you gotta follow your dreams, hey, oh yeah
Oh looking down an unpaved road
Everyone else sees dirt but you see gold

It's Monday and we're stuck in traffic
I complain I say, "I've nearly had it"
You hear and you smile
My world spins, you're like my gravity
Pull me in towards my sanity, you clear my sky
How do you do what you do

[Chorus]

You're on a crowded city pavement flooded with rain
You see a slick dance floor and it's calling your name, hey

[Chorus]

Oh looking down an unpaved road
Where I see dirt, you see gold
