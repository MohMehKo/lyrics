Every whispered word you spoke
Felt like a feather light brush stroke
On the paintings my heart hoped
Would come to life some day
All the plans we dreamed about
We'd imagine them out loud
All in colour, oh but now
I watch them fade away

[Chorus:]
Ooh if I was only losing you
Goodbye wouldn't be so brutal
It would be almost easy
But we built castles in the clouds
We planned a thousand futures out
Now you're packing up and leaving
With every dream that never came true
Ooh wish I was only losing you

Your whole family, our friends
Don't know what I'll do without them
That perfect dress that I will never wear
The nights that we will never share
The laughter that you used to save for me

[Chorus]

The girl I was with you, was my best self
Now I'm watching her become someone else

[Chorus]

With every dream that never came true
Ooh wish I was only losing you
