When I was young nothing seemed to touch me
Even the force of a breaking day
Nothing could prevent it from coming
Yet it felt so far away

Now I shouldn't be afraid of the journey
Everyone must take to the sea
But the wood and the iron beneath me
Holds strong under my feet
And gently urges me

To try
To take a step, to never look back
Try
To leave the past forever behind
I've only to try

Now that I'm a little bit older
I'm aware of a path I should take
And I can't count on having a partner
To come and ease my way

I've grown tired of needing excuses
Always looking forward to the day
Where I can touch my own freedom and choices
With no need to explain
No, no need to explain

To try
To take a step, to never look back
Try
To leave the past forever behind
I've only to try

Try (only just to try)
Try
Some things given, and some things are taken away
Ya we let go of some things

You've got to try
Some things given and
Some things taken
Some things left behind

I've only to try
