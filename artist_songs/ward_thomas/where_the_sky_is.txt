Feels like the sky is falling, the world is coming apart
Some days you wonder who you are
Feels like you're always running, and it hurts to stop
It's so much harder than you thought

[Chorus:]
So take my hand and we will run to the country side
Find somewhere the air is clean and the water's wide
Feel at home as the clouds roll on and set the sunlight free
Look the sky is right where it should be

Why don't we take a picture, take it with our eyes
Keep it like a secret safe inside
Where every field's a garden, wild with space to grow
Now we know that quiet is a place where we can go

[Chorus]

High above the stress of the city away from everything
High enough to make you feel like it's all alright, we're all alright
Just follow me

[Chorus]

You and I are right where we should be
