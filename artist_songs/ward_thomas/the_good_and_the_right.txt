Swallowing my morning cup
I saw a mother out with her child
While she was yelling down the phone
He held the game that occupied his mind
And I wonder what will happen to his life
And I can't help thinking something just ain't right

Turning on the radio
I'm fed up with these single-minded lines
Does anybody stop and think
There's more to words and just a stupid rhyme
And I wonder if they'll ever seen the signs
That we're hungry for a message that inspires

What happened to the good
What happened to the right
We've got to drag it back
We've got to keep it in sight
Have we been led away
Been taken for a ride
They say it's the only way
But it still ain't right

Turning down your friend request
Cuz you won't see me at my best that way
You'll just see what's on the screen
And judge the things you've never seen any way
And I wonder if we'll ever reach the place
That's not a two dimensional book that hides my face

What happened to the good
What happened to the right
We've got to drag it back
We've got to keep it in sight
Have we been led away
Been taken for a ride
They say it's the only way
But it still ain't right

I'm as guilty as the rest
Gotta spread my wings and leave this nest
Empty answers keep us asking more what is this
What is this
What is this
What is this for

What happened to the good
What happened to the right
We've got to drag it back
We've got to keep it in sight
Have we been led away
Been taken for a ride
They say it's the only way
But it still ain't right
