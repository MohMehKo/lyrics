I can remember shouting
I can remember slamming doors
And remember seeing signs

Holding it all inside me
Trying to read between the lines

And I can still hear the silence
It fell on the floor like heavy rain
God let it wash the words away
Nothing was strong enough to save me
Or wash away the stains

From where I stand
With the things I know now
They were counting the years on one hand
And they're counting the tears on the other
From where I stand
I could never have known
When something loves
Something sufferers
And something dies
Then we cry

Nothing had felt so empty
Nothing had felt so insecure
Nothing could take me from that place
Wanting to hear your every word
And know the reason for your fallen face

There was someone to hold my hand
Somebody to share my point of view
Standing beside me as we go
At least if I have that forever
I'll never have to know

From where I stand
With the things I know now
They were counting the years on one hand
And they're counting the tears on the other
From where I stand
I could never have known
When something loves
Something sufferers
And something dies
Then we cry

From where I stand with the things I know now
They were counting the years on one hand
And they're counting the tears on the other
From where I stand
I could never have known
When something loves
Something sufferers
And something dies
Then we cry
