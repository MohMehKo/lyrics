If all we are is material, does it matter, does it matter
If all I see is the outside, not the inside, it matters

Silence, why is there this silence
When I ask you where you think we are and where we're going
Take me, I wish that you would take me
Somewhere brand new, coz sometimes I just worry

[Chorus:]
If all we are is material, does it matter, does it matter
If all I see is the outside, not the inside, it matters
Coz you're my entire universe and I wanna be your sun and all your stars
I wanna be where you are, what you are
Material

You call me, you call me when you need me
Did you really think that I would wait for you forever

[Chorus x2]
