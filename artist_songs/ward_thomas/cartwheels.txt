I'm beside you at the mirror
Hi, do I look familiar
Would you believe that we were happy once
True, like an answered prayer
You were mine, and we were rare
Now I fight to find what's left of us
I give, I give, I give, you never take
I bend, I bend, I bend so we won't break

[Chorus:]
I've been doing cartwheels anything to save us
Anything to make you notice me
I've been running circles, always getting nowhere, putting on a show
But you won't see
I've been doing cartwheels, I've been doing cartwheels

Bright as a sparkler light
I write our names across your night
It's only me who sees it fade away
Into shame, that I can't keep you honest
Blame that you don't want even want this
Love enough to make you wanna stay I give, I give, I give, you never take it
I still, I still, I still believe we'll make it

[Chorus]

After everything I've done you still run and disappear
Maybe all I've got is hoping I can show you how it feels

So I've been doing cartwheels, I've been doing cartwheels

[Chorus]

I'm beside you at the mirror
Hi, do I look familiar
