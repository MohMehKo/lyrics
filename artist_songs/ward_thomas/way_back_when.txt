Do you remember back when walls were high
And you had to really try to find a way
Did you feel cut up from your friends back home
Without your mobile phone to pass your time away?
I can't begin to understand
How you were walking hand in hand
With people who shared this world
If I could just be half the girl I see
When I look at you so
Tell me 'bout all the things you did
When your jeans were flared and your hair was big
Screens were grey

What's it like to play my role back then?
I was told to never look back
'Cos everyone knows that the world ain't flat
So sit me down and turn me around to way back when
Yeaaahhh

Seeing you know I question how we've changed
Our generation games not one I played
From big to small I know you've seen it all
Now I live my life by the things you gave
You felt like you were in a safer place
Didn't have to hide your face just to fit within the rules
And the worlds all yours so
Tell me 'bout all the things you did
When your jeans were flared and your hair was big
Screens were grey

What's it like to play my role back then?
I was told to never look back
'Cos everyone knows that the world ain't flat
So sit me down and turn me around to way back when
Yeeeahhh

We've got to keep it all alive
And help your history survive
Respect the people who were here before us
Now tell me what you think about this
Can you see all the things that we've missed?
So we'll begin to write some stories of our own
So tell me 'bout all the things you did
When your jeans were flared and your hair was big
Screens were grey

What's it like to play my role back then?
I was told to never look back
'Cos everyone knows that the world ain't flat
So sit me down and turn me around to way back when
Tell me 'bout all the things you did
When your jeans were flared and your hair was big
Screens were grey

What's it like to play my role back then?
I was told to never look back
'Cos everyone knows that the world ain't flat
So sit me down and turn me around to way back when
Dabadaba dohh ehhh oh yeah
