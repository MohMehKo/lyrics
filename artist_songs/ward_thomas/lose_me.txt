I was so young and you were so hungry
You sold me a glittering run around, run around
Gave you my secrets you promised to keep them
Turned them to weapons and shot me down, shot me down

Don't look now I'm standing up
Walking out, I've had enough

[Chorus:]
You used me
Used me like a ladder like I didn't matter
Like I was a card you could play
So excuse me for moving on without you
Now that I know how you'd do anything to win at your game
But you lose me
You lose me

Look at you now dug a hole in the ground
You're grasping at straws trying to
Pull me back, pull me back
I'm out of reach, nothing else you can teach me
I've hurt and I've healed there's no
Going back, going back

All those dreams you tried to take
I'll set one free, for every way

[Chorus]

Look at you now dug a hole in the ground

[Chorus]
