I could be the voice the stereo will sell you
That no-one really values singing on the auction block
But I'm not
I could be the dirt that everybody walks on
And soak up all their thoughts on how to make it to the top
But I'm not
But I'm not

[Chorus:]
Through every stage of understanding
They try to tell me what I want
And I can't say just who I am yet
But I'm closer than I thought
Coz I know who I'm not

I could be the breath that blows out someone's candle
Whispers underhanded jealous wishes in the dark
But I'm not
And I could be the critic with judgement in my eyes
Set on nothing but the prize, the kind who hides a broken heart
But I'm not

[Chorus]

I could be the step, blind but still believing
I will find my freedom
They may say that I am lost
But I'm not
