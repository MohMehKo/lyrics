When it all comes caving in
And you can't be brave again
Whenever you need a friend, need a friend
Call me
When the red light stops your tracks
And you know you can't turn back
Whenever you need a friend, need a friend
Call me

[Chorus:]
Coz I'll be there to carry you home
When you're on your own so scared
And I'll be there when it all goes wrong
Just to show you someone cares
If you need a light, I'll help you find a reason to believe
Call me

Yeah we all fight different fights
But everybody feels, everybody bleeds, everybody cries
So whenever you need a friend, need a friend
Call me

[Chorus]

When it all comes caving in, I'm beside you till the end

[Chorus]

If you need a light, I'll help you find a reason to believe
Call me
