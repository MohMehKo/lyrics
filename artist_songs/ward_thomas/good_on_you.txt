Sorry that I'm late, some things never change
God you look the same, but different
Tom said you moved in, you're happy again
Says she's really something different

[Chorus:]
You wear the years like a brand new jacket
I couldn't have given you
We put the past behind all of that sadness
I'm glad you've found something true
Love looks good on you

Those grey ocean eyes
That crashed into my life
Moves someone else's tide
And it should
Your fiery golden soul, that I could never hold
Has found a better home and it's good

[Chorus]

Oh to see you here
Takes me back to I don't remember when
How many years has it been
How many lives have we lived since then

You wear the years like a brand new jacket...

[Chorus]

Sorry that I'm late, some things never change
God you look the same, but different
