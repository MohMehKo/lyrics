I remember us alone
Waiting for the light to go
Don't you feel that hunger?
I've got so many secrets to show
When I saw you on that stage
I shivered with the look you gave
Don't you hear that rhythm?
Can you show me how we can escape?

Oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh
I was biting my tongue
I was trying to hide
Oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh
I'll forget what I've done
I will be redefined

It's shaking the sky
And I'm following lightning
I'll recover if you keep me alive
Don't leave me behind
Can you see me, I'm shining
And it's you that I've been waiting to find

I'm holding it all tonight
I'm folding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find

Now that you can hear that sound
Now that you can't hold me down
You can pull me under
You can raise everything to the ground
Everything I can't arrange
Every part of me you changed
Just hold me together
Tell me you'll always want me to stay

Oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh
I was biting my tongue
I was trying to hide
Oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh
I'll forget what I've done
I will be redefined

It's shaking the sky
And I'm following lightning
I'll recover if you keep me alive
Don't leave me behind
Can you see me, I'm shining
And it's you that I've been waiting to find

I wanna be the one you steal
I wanna be the one you shield
I wanna be the one that your love, that your love can heal
I wanna be the one you steal
I wanna be the one you shield
I wanna be the one that your love, that your love
Oooh oooh oooh
Can you see me I'm shining?

It's shaking the sky
And I'm following lightning
I'll recover if you keep me alive
Don't leave me behind
Can you see me, I'm shining
And it's you that I've been waiting to find

I'm holding it all tonight
I'm folding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find

I'm holding it all tonight
I'm folding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find

Oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh
