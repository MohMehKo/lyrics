Two years to the day
Straight up an instant connection
You broke her heart for me, and I let you
History is telling me
I'm gonna be walking in her shoes
You let her down for me, now it's my turn

[Chorus:]
I shoulda known, I could have told you you were lying
Fool me once, fool me twice, oh stupid me
I didn't wanna doubt, didn't wanna find out
But now I know
Coz you came home with
Guilty flowers
Guilty flowers

Two years to the day
Roses to show your affection
Now thorns are digging in, and it's my fault
Who was I, thinking that I could be somebody different
There were signs in your eyes, wonder why I kept mine closed
Another notch on your bed post

[Chorus]

Guilty flowers...

Who was I, thinking that I could be somebody different

[Chorus x2]
