I found myself acting like you do today
Repeating words that would say
I wonder if you meant to be so easy to read

Only making sense in your own way

Do you know how fearless you are
And how much we have grown to appreciate the scars
So much of you has taken us this far
Your influence has left a lasting mark
Though it took some time to realise
It's no surprise it's part of who we are

I caught myself thinking aloud like you do
Thoughts I never meant to turn to words
I'd like to think that I could be as selfless
As you are always putting other people first

Do you know how fearless you are
And how much we have grown to appreciate the scars
So much of you has taken us this far
Your influence has left a lasting mark
Though it took some time to realise
It's no surprise it's part of who we are

I never want to reach the day
When I'm not learning from your every way
Your words will always stay
We know it isn't easy to be on your own
But you've inspired us and made a happy home

Do you know how fearless you are
And how much we have grown to appreciate the scars
So much of you has taken us this far
Your influence has left a lasting mark
Though it took some time to realise
It comes as no surprise...
Your who we are
