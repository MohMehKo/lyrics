Each time you come around out of the blue
You tell me something new and unexpected
I've tried to understand but I've never been to the places you've seen

I don't expect to meet someone like you
Think I'll see all the different things that I can be because of you

You're that someone on the top of the guest list
Each little story that I tell has got you in it
Something about you I can't put my finger on it
Every time, even just a little time
You're the life and soul
You're the life and soul

I think that you go to prove that someone you knew can somebody new each time you see them
And though I know that you try to show that you're not aware
Of how much you care
Of all the people that meet someone like you
Something that you do that makes me feel like I've come home again

You're that someone on the top of the guest list
Each little story that I tell has got you in it
Something about you I can't put my finger on it
Every time, even just a little time you're the life and soul
You're the life and soul

Well I've thought this through
Today I'm gonna do
The things I only do because you

You're that someone on the top of the guest list
Each little story that I tell has got you in it
Something about you I can't put my finger on it
Every time, even just a little time you're the life and soul

You're the life and soul
