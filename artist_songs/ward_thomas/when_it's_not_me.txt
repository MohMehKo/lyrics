Look at her hair, look at her make up running
I guess somebody had a good time last night
Aren't those still the same clothes, wonder if her boyfriend knows
I guess she had it coming
Look at him with his Gucci shoes, stepping on losers
Just to get a little more
I bet he's over paid
I bet he gets ladies then kicks 'em out the back door

[Chorus:]
It's easy to point the finger in the other direction
It's easy, staring through the window, from the outside in oh
Mamma told me I should play nice, karma's a bitch
So you're gonna pay a high price
Easy, when it's not me, when it's not me, when it's not me

He's sitting at the bar, throws another whiskey on the tab
He must have a problem, he should try a little harder
She's too young to have a baby, bet she's really lazy
And, she's gonna be a bad mother
How could they ever be like that
I know that I could never do that
They're so stupid, and I'm so smart
Life's simple from afar

[Chorus]

Now I can hear them talking
They're saying what they think they see
When you're looking from the inside out
Well it's a different story

Cause it's easy to point the finger in the other direction
Easy...

[Chorus]
