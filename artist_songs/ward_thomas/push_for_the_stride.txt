How many times have you woken up
To find your coffee's cold and a broken cup
That's a hell of a way
To start your day

How many times have you looked to the date
To find a calendar full of empty pages
What a hell of a way
To see time flippin' away

Like a barrel down the hill keeps rolling faster
And circumstances become your master
And you realize
Your hands ain't on the wheel anymore

With the wind at your back and the sun at your side
Take the bull by the horns and ride
You gotta push for the stride
It wins the race every time

So when you're low on steam
but your aim is high
You gotta keep your eye on the prize
You gotta push for of stride
It wins the race every time

For the stride
For the stride

Have you found yourself falling in a vicious dream
And you wake yourself up with a nasty scream
Waking up screaming
It's a hell of a way to get through the night

Have you opened up your heart to a promise made
Just to get it kicked back into yesterday
It's a hell of a way to lose all the ground that you gained
So when your spirits down and you mood is dark

Let the dark horse come and take you 'round
And you realize you're back in the saddle again.
With the wind at your back and the sun at your side
Take the bull by the horns and ride

You gotta push for the stride
It wins the race every time
So when your low on steam
But your aim is high

You gotta keep your eye on the prize
You gotta push for the stride
It wins the race every time

For the stride
For the stride
For the stride
For the stride

With the wind at your back and the sun at your side
Take the bull by the horns and ride
You gotta push for the stride
It wins the race every time

So when your low on steam
But your aim is high
You gotta keep your eye on the prize
You gotta push for the stride

It wins the race every time
Gotta push for the stride
It wins the race every time

For the stride
For the stride
