Riding with those halo cowboys
Mr. Lovejoy anywhere we go
And in the middle it's habitual
It's a ritual closet show
But I'm
Happy as I can be, don't feel much better
Think I'm numb to what's going on
And maybe that's just better, yes I'm happy
Periscope up and the radar
Clear ahead so far still I'm broke
And it's so sweet from the backseat
Listen to the radio man choke as he says 
That I'm
Happy as I can be, don't feel much better
Think I'm numb to what's going on
And maybe that's just better
Is this what you want to see
Is this what you see...
That I'm as happy as I can be
Yeah...
Happy as I can be, don't feel much better
Think I'm numb to what's going on
And maybe that's just better
Well I'm happy as I can be, don't feel much better
Think I'm numb to what's going on
Maybe that's just better
Is this what you want to see
Well I'm as happy as can be...
Is this what you want to see
That I'm as happy as can be
