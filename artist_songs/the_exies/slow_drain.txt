Yeah, im nameless love found me lost but then im thankful, thankful righting the wrongs forgotten
Blessings, blessings down on my knees my soul is endless, endless and im so relieved but if you
Must be concerned 
[chorus]
Im on a slow drain as you watch me burn im on my way back down but if you must be concerned im
On a slow drain as you watch me burn, slow drain,
Yes im wasted, wasted end of my rope but then im brain dead, brian dead you make me choke new
Colic baby, baby kicks and it screams my soul is endless, endless and im so relieved but if you
Must be concerned 

[rpt. chorus]
