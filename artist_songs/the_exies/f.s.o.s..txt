Alright, alright everything is just fine 
Here comes here comes a bundle of hiss 
Alright, alright everything in my life is so 
Fucked up fucked up I'm losing my grip

Some days I bleed, I fall like stone
I'm always afraid, I feel so alone, 

[Chorus:]
Got a false sense of security
Giving me a real sense of insecurity
Messing with my head now, head down
What the fuck is wrong with me
A false sense of security
Is fucking with my head

Attention, attention everybody look at me
Stand up, stand up, I need your belief
Rejection, rejection always seems to follow me
Head down, I need some relief

Some days I bleed, I fall like stone
I'm always afraid, I feel so alone, 

[Chorus]

It's easy to see, I'm flat on my back
I sigh and I scream, I'm under attack
And some days I bleed, I fall like a stone
I'm always afraid, I feel so alone 

[Chorus]

False sense of security
Giving me a real sense of insecurity
Messing with my head now, head down
What the fuck is wrong with me
A false sense of security
Is fucking with my head

It's fucking with my head [2x]
