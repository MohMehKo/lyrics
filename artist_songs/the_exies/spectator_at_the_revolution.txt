Get out vote baby there's strength in numbers
You follow the leaders into glorious blunders again
Before you start singing, better know the meaning of the words and slogans
The bandleaders ringing out a soap box he shouts it out he says
But i do good i'm just misunderstood
So can't see i'm looking for solutions
Cause i'm no spectator at the revolution
Cause i'm no spectator at the revolution
