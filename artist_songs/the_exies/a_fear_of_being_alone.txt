Come here, i've got a fear of being alone
Will you nurse it, i can't sew the wounds myself
Silent screaming as if i had lost my breath
Somewhat damaged and i want you to notice

You opened these eyes and made me see
This is how life shows me

A beating heart
A memory
I'm not alone
Will i ever be, happy
Tell me why
I'm paralyzed
Underneath
Surrender my serenity
Hoping one day that i

The days and years
They're hanging down around my neck
Choking the meaning
Suffocating who i am
In you, a refuge
The safest place to call my home
Killing the feeling
This fear of being alone

You opened these eyes and made me see
This is how life shows me

A beating heart
A memory
I'm not alone
Will I ever be happy?
Tell me why
I'm paralyzed
Underneath
Surrender my serenity

Hoping one day that i
Will feel alive
Just like you

Cause everybody hurts
Everyone is used
Anybody's them
And anyone is you
Read between the lines
You will find the truth
Hope is the light
That leads me to you

A beating heart
A memory
I'm not alone
Will i ever be, happy
Tell me why
I'm terrified,
I've got a need,
I don't know why,
Will I always be sorry,
Tell me why
I'm paralyzed
Underneath
Surrender my serenity

Hoping one day that i
Will feel alive
Just like you [x3]
