Oh, Camille are you just as bored as me
Living down a fantasy, we're coping out
Well gotta gotta give gotta give it away
In emergency, how beautiful to be here
To be here when it's time to go
So, I'll make you, make you, I'm never gonna break the line
It comes as no surprise
That I do this to myself, living on the bitterside
And never knowing why
It comes as no surprise, that I bring this on myself
Living down a fantasy on the brighter side
Oh, Camille are you just as high as me
Stoned and glued to this old chair...come and see
Well I just had the strangest sick daydream
A revelation how becoming to see it, to see it
Made me wanna cower down
So roll away, roll away from the hurt inside
It comes as no surprise
That I do this to myself, living on the bitterside
And never knowing why
It comes as no surprise, that I bring this on myself
Living down a fantasy on the brighter side
Well I'm cleared for a taxi run through I'm still breaking down
Could you ever baptize me, cause I'm still fumbling around
And at times it seems I'm missing something I once had
And I don't know, don't know what it was that I had
It comes as no surprise
That I do this to myself, living on the bitterside
And never knowing why
It comes as no surprise, that I bring this on myself
Living down a fantasy on the brighter side
On the brighter side
On the brighter side
On the brighter side
It don't matter, don't matter to me
It really don't matter, don't matter to me
Ya know, it don't matter, don't matter to me
Ya know, it really don't matter, don't matter to me
