Forget myself on your command
To find you here, from where I stand
To lose myself in you so

I'll kickout, I'll kickout, before you cage me
I'll shut down, I'll shut down, till someone saves me
Cuz I don't know how much more that I can take
I'll kick out, I'll kick out, before you cage me

I curse the walls, for weeks on end
If someone's there, won't you sound for help
Before I run away!

I'll kickout, I'll kickout, before you cage me
I'll shout down, I'll shout down, till someone saves me
Cuz I don't know how much more that I can take
I'll kick out, I'll kick out.........before you cage me

I won't be around for you to drag me...down!

I'll kickout, I'll kickout, before you cage me
I'll shout down, I'll shout down, till someone saves me
I'll kickout, I'll kickout, before you cage me
Before you cage me
Before you cage me
