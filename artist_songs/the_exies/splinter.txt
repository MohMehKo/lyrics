I know what it feels 
Like it burns from the inside
I know what it hurts like
Cause ive been wrong a thousand times
My bones are all cracked
Splinter deep in my back

[chorus]
Im still the same but we have changed
And now i have to live with my mistakes
Will i ever learn
Im battered and bruised
Scratched on the inside
Im losing myself im so sick of the lies
Dead ring in my ears the hole underneath
Youre deep in my skin youre the splinter in me

Youll never know how hard i
Try to keep my head right
I miss all the bright lights
Shinning down like the sun burns my skin
Ten silver sets me free
Like the ones before me

[rpt. chorus]
