I need a meaning
I need a soul
This circle is vicious but precious like gold
Dont push the river
Dont stop the flow
Dead in the water caught in the undertow

[chorus]
You are the ocean i am a wave
Fell out of motion i lost my way
You are the ocean i am the wave
I fell out of motion

I learned a lesson i learned it so well
I wont forget it, ive got a truth to tell
My last confession,my faith was long dead
I pushed the river was more that i could bear

[chorus]

With a pain in my heart for so long

[rpt. 4x]

I need a meaning
I need a soul
This circle is vicious but precious like gold
Dont push the river
Dont stop the flow
Dead in the water caught in the undertow

[chorus]
