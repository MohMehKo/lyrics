She's a wonderful wonder
And she crashed down like a thunder
She arrives at the moment I leave
A battle-ground for an eye

I love my evil genius
I love my evil genius
Nothing can come between us
I'm in love with a genius

My love is fearless
Tempted by a strong weakness
Strung out on a beautiful charm
She's the middle in my eye

I love my evil genius
I love my evil genius
Nothing can come between us
I'm in love with a genius
God knows she's a genius

She's goin' make, she's goin' make, make the world go
I can't ecscape, I can't ecscape so I find hope
She's goin' make, she's goin' make, make the world go
I can't ecscape, I can't ecscape so I find hope
She's goin' make, she's goin' make, make the world go
She's goin' make, she's goin' make, make the world go

(Round) My evil genius
(Makes my world go, round) My evil genius
(Make, make my world go)
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh
