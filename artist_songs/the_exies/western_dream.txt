Oh yeah, yeah
Call all the slackers, as they hitch on the road
Call all the swingers everytime they got one home
One day, can't find the reason
One day, to the right the wrong

Got no herd on the range, but there's love for my soul
Crawl inside me, slowly, and let's
Go let it go live it crazy
Sunny, sunny, why everytime I don't know
I can't explain it
I know, I know it's the samething
Something tells me I'll always carry that weight down
But I feel fine

Convoy to destination, wielding a steady blade
John la Conquer root, done saved us, done saved the day
Hey now, they're speaking sweetly
Hey now, they're screaming out

Lazybones on the bed, come in, come let it out
Crawl inside me, slowly, and let's
Go let it go live it crazy
Sunny, sunny, why everytime I don't know
I can't explain it
I know, I know it's the samething
Something tells me I'll always carry that weight oh yeah
Falling all over you in a special way
Open the door, give it your praise
For the one who listens when you're sleeping
I wanna take you with me
Go let it go live it crazy
Sunny, sunny, why everytime I don't know
I can't explain it
I know, I know it's the samething
Something tells me I'll always carry that weight down
It's what they're saying
Go let it go live it crazy
I know, I know it's the samething
But I feel fine
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
