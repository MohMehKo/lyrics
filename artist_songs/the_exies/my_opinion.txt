Dont take it out on me
Dont take it out on me
Dont take it out on me
The point youre missing

[rpt.]

Cause talk is cheap,so let me be
Just cut the rope,and set me free
Cause somethings wrong, somethings wrong

In my opinion
Youre so obscene 
In my opinion
Nothing but greed
In my opinion

[rpt.]

Whats the difference you couldnt change things
Its your tradition,yeah

Dont take it out on me
Dont take it out on me
Dont take it out on me
Youre wasting my time

You wont remember
You wont rememberdont try to talk to me
Dont try to talk to me
Dont try to talk to me
I dont want to listen
You wont remember how youre raping my life

[chorus]

The water will rust
In my opinion
Youve broken my trust 
In my opinion
Whats the difference you couldnt change things
Its your tradition
