Can you takle me as i am
And the sting of my sweat against your mouth
You judge me till theres nothing left
You and your opinions wear me out

[chorus]
You dont know me
Im immune,i am free
Not a slave to your beliefs
Im immune,out of reach
Youre alone, stuck with your disease
You hate the things that i say,and who i seem to be
But you dont look so normal to me

Serve you daily rituals
Then make up the rules to suit yourself
Ill never be who you are
So why dont i just start to hate myself

[chorus]
