Where did I go wrong
Can't look you in the eye
Feeling so ashamed
Feels like I could die

[Chorus]
Hold me up and don't let go
I've had enough
I'm tired of breathing
Tired of feeling
Tired of looking at the past for meaning
Tired of running
Tired of searching
Tired of trying
But i'm not tired of you

Losing everything
It's something I can't face
Hope is on the run
It's something I can't fake

[Chorus]

I want to feel a change
I don't mind if it hurts
You take away the pain
You're the only thing that's pure

[Chorus]
