I don't feel anything
Isn't that amazing
I don't want everything
Just a little bit of nothing

But even if it feels strange
It stands apart from nature
Even if you don't know
Where the circuit breaker

Why calm and collapsed
Why calm and collapsed
Why calm and collapsed
We were calm and collapsed

Is it just me lyin' here
Or is someone breathing
Why do I live in fear
When I'm not sure you're here

Cuz even if it feels strange
It stands apart from nature
Even if you don't know
Where the circuit breaker

Why calm and collapsed
Why calm and collapsed
Why calm and collapsed
We were calm and collapsed

So break me down
Our love isn't cool
So break me down
And crucify me again

Cuz even if it feels strange
It stands apart from nature
Even if you don't know
Where the circuit breaker

Givin' up a feelin', I'm feelin' no existance

Why calm and collapsed
Why calm and collapsed
Why calm and collapsed
We were calm and collapsed
I'm calm and collapsed
