Wait, I didn't see it coming
I took one last look around
The machines were out of order
The machines are out of order

Wait, I never paid attention
Day dreamin' till the end
I need a second dose of childhood
I need a second dose of childhood

I gotta get gone get outta the rain
I gotta get gone get outta the rain
I gotta get gone get outta the rain
I gotta get gone, get gone

I'm feelin' no meaning without you (I've lost all of myself)
I'm searchin' for a reason without you (Why can't it always be true)
Keep feelin', keep breathin', just saved me from myself

Wait, I can't behave now
Sit around, I'm such a mess
Looked around there's no one else here
I looked around there's no one else

Wait, I went the wrong way
I lift off okay to go
I wanna make my lunar orbit
I try my best to obsorb it

I gotta get gone get outta the rain
I gotta get gone get outta the rain
I gotta get gone get outta the rain
I gotta get gone, get gone

I'm feelin' no meaning without you (I've lost all of myself)
I'm searchin' for a reason without you (Why can't it always be true)
Keep feelin', keep breathin', just saved me from myself

I gotta get, gotta get, gone!
I gotta get gone!
I gotta get gone!
I gotta get...gone!

I'm feelin' no meaning without you (I've lost all of myself)
I'm searchin' for a reason without you (Why can't it always be true)
Keep feelin', keep breathin', saved me from myself!
