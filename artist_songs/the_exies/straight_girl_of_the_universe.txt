I'm in bloom
I go vroom
I go right off without my little parachute
Made me strain
Did her part
Put a perfect summer solstice on my heart..and it's a start
And it's a start, and it's a start
I don't know why, she's got something in her eyes
Friendly la-foe, just like Clara Bow...be
My only one, be my only one
Dream in my mind, one of a kind
Cause she's so really keen
Set my sail, for her charm
All I want is to be the apple of her eye
Rocket ride in a car
Put a perfect love attack under the stars...and it's a start
And it's a start, and it's a start
I don't know why, she's got something in her eyes
Friendly la-foe, just like Clara Bow...be
My only one, be my only one
Dream in my mind, one of a kind
Made me feel sad for the rest
Baby driver and she's the best, I want that girl
She's so innocently preverse, yes I want my straight girl of the universe
At least I think I do
I don't know why, she's got something in her eyes
Friendly la-foe, just like Clara Bow...be
My only one, be my only one
Dream in my mind, one of a kind
Made me feel sad for the rest
Baby driver and she's the best, I want that girl
She's so innocently preverse, yes I want my straight girl of the universe
At least I think I do...at least I think I do
...and I do...and I do...and I do.
