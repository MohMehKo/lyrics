Well you watched the sun,
Gazed a star, and it won't be long
It won't be long
Before you rust, come try your luck
It's just a plan, Kafka said

Well careless driver steps on the brake
Better love the envy that you create
Better watch yourself
Watch yourself

Are you ready or not, maybe let's go
Kick your head back and watch it in slow-mo

For all you pretty ones, ya hum along in oblivion
Afraid to be alone, all made up to be someone
Oh, you pretty ones, fade away and come undone
Got to find a better way, to mold your skin or so they say
That's right

Such lofty hymns, a kiss to the wind
And take good care, like you ever cared
It's bittersweet and a kiss goodnight
Elevator to the bright side of life
That's all you know, the story goes

Tightropes walking much tripping on clovers
Disillusion yourself from your brothers

For all you pretty ones, ya hum along in oblivion
Afraid to be alone, you're all made up to be someone
Oh, you pretty ones, you fade away and come undone
You've got to find a better way, to mold your skin or so they say
That's right

Oh that's right

Yeah, are you ready or not, maybe let's go
Kick your head back and watch it in slow-mo

For all you pretty ones, ya hum along in oblivion
Afraid to be alone, all made up to be someone
Oh, you pretty ones, you fade away and come undone
Got to find a better way, to mold your skin or so they say
To mold your skin or so they say
To mold your skin or so they say
That's right
That's right
That's right
