Spiked on acid
So elastic a springtime is here again
Dream I float above on rocket balloon travels far away
I can't wait I will change
Ever so slightly drained and I'm thinking now
Love I feel, colored shields
Love is real, unexpressness is all I have now
Can you count to ten?
Head down crash landing
In my rocket balloon
Launch me to this moon, you always will, you always do
Blow this time away, just like yesterday
It's already gone, I'm warm and safe in my rocket balloon
Sitting in a rosy hue of unlimited successes
Gently as explosions reach their fingers
All through my hair
Warm and safe I know a place
Ever so love to space on you my Marigold
As you're red as I'm blue
Special fuel, lift you to my
Rocket balloon
Can you count to ten?
Head down crash landing
In my rocket balloon
Launch me to this moon, you always will, you always do
Blow this time away, just like yesterday
It's already gone, I'm warm and safe in my rocket balloon
In my rocket balloon
In my rocket balloon
In my rocket balloon
In my rocket balloon
