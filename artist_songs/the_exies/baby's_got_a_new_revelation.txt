I know, I've been in conversation
I had a reservation
But now it's going slow
One trip, I fell into a big drop
While choking on a rain drop, and I ain't thirsty, no

But suddenly I caught up with a rainbow
Its shadow glowed in the dark
And all of my answers turned into questions
The ending became the start

So, c'mon she said, turn on yourself
Baby's got a new revelation now
Exit to Zen, come take my hand
Meet your maker and we'll do it all over again 
One last time
A time

We'll kiss off, you're callused and abrasive
Over underrated and I won't break for you
Switch on my targeting computer
Camouflage mag shooter, specially made for you

While keeping an eye on a cool connotation
And tripping on a Winter's day
Asleep with the lights on, covered in angels
Won't stop before I go astray

So, c'mon she said, turn on yourself
Baby's got a new revelation now
Exit to Zen, come take my hand
Meet your maker and we'll do it all over again 
One last time

And suddenly I caught up with a rainbow
Its shadow glowed in the dark
And all of my answers turned into questions
The ending became the start

So, c'mon she said, turn on yourself
Baby's got a new revelation now
Exit to Zen, come take my hand
Meet your maker and we'll do it all over again 
Well c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon
Baby's got a new revelation now
Exit to Zen, come take my hand 
Meet your maker and we'll do it all over again 
Do it again, one last time
A time, a time
