Pacify the urge inside
I hurt myself again
You get the best of me
And so, how i get right
Get riddled inside
You gave me a new misunderstanding
Scraping my elbows in vein
I'm used to the pain
I've nothing to lose
When i'm winning the game
Of getting over you

I'm living a lie
You always leave me behind
For someone new
Now it's my turn to hate
Like you always do
I'll give you a taste
A dose of your own medicine

I feel love i feel pain
I mend in my own way
Following you in sad devotion
Broken heart broken spine
I gave you my life
You left me to die
From lack of oxygen
Scraping my elbows in vein
I'm used to the pain
Scraping my elbows in vein
I'm used to the pain
Here's something to use
When sedation gives way
I'm getting over you

I'm living a lie
You always leave me behind
For someone new
Now it's my turn to hate
Like you always do
I'll give you a taste
A dose of your own medicine

Won't get the best of me
No, not again
I'm not the enemy
Like you, still pretend
I won't let you forget
How you broke me down

I'm living a lie
You always leave me behind
For someone new
Now it's my turn to hate
Like you always do
I'll give you a taste
A dose of your own medicine
