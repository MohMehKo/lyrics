A life less ordinary
A second chance to believe
Spending my time wishing
Something would fall into reach
There's no use in pretending
I've wasted unspoken words
There's comfort in knowing
In knowing just what you're worth

Falling deeper
I'm falling deeper
So let me out
Let me out

Let me go now, something's missing
I just want my life to change
It all seems the same, i'm feeling caged
I'm tired of breaking down
Let me go now, i've learned my lessons
I'm so numb, i've passed the pain
It all seems the same, i need a change
From my ordinary world

I avoid myself when i can
But somehow i'm crawling underneath
Trying to break the habits
But it takes a stronger remedy
There's always pain in mending
The withdrawl of slowly coming clean
Have i the strength to face it
The darkest place inside of me

Falling deeper
I'm falling deeper
So let me out
Let me out

Let me go now, something's missing
I just want my life to change
It all seems the same, i'm feeling caged
I'm tired of breaking down
Let me go now, i've learned my lessons
I'm so numb, i've passed the pain
It all seems the same, i need a change
From my ordinary world

How long will i stand
In the waiting line
How long will i wait here
For my chance to shine
How long can i take this
I'm running out of time
Hoping by tomorrow
I won't feel the same

Let me go now, something's missing
I just want my life to change
It all seems the same, i'm feeling caged
I'm tired of breaking down
Let me go now, i've learned my lessons
I'm so numb, i've passed the pain
It all seems the same, i need a change
From my ordinary world
