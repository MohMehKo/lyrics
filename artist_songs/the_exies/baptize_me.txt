Youre in my head tormenting me
Im running scred in my time of need 
Cuts on my head cuts on my feet 
Im here waiting so baptize me 
I need a reason i need to know just why 
You were my meaning 
Now its me you deny
Youre in my head tormenting me 
Im here waiting so baptize me  hole in myself 
Kills by degrees 
Gift of compassion 
You gave to me 
Blistered my hands 
On your beliefs
Im here waiting so baptize me
