Youre pretending to be somthing youre not
Youre collecting a head full of rot
Youre self righteous,the butt of the joke
And its a secret,everyone knows

[chorus]
You know you know you know you know it
You show you show you show youve shown it
My dear enemy, backstabbing me
Like a friend to me, like you seem to be

You think i dont see
You  backstabbing me
Like a friend to me
My dear enemy
Youre condescending with every word
It makes you happy but what is it worth?
Youre like a virus eating my skin
Its a problem i think its a sin

[chorus]
