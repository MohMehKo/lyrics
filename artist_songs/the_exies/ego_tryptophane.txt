Hold me closely, don't be careful
Easy does it, don't you know I'm sick to my stomach
So reach your hand back, flick the switch on the portable
Lofi radio and kick the beat in
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah...
I'm fading away, but
I don't mind, it's so much fun
Getting lost with you in the sun
Ego tryptophane you make me high
You lull me down and I wonder just why
Driving faster, so much faster when we get there
Well it be a slow day out in the desert?
There's so many daydreams along this road
A fountain in my head is on
I think it might explode
I think it might
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah...
I can't stay awake
I fall asleep and drift away
But I don't mind, it's so much fun
Getting lost with you in the sun
Ego tryptophane you make me high
You lull me down and I wonder just why
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
I don't mind, it's so much fun
Getting lost with you in the sun
Ego tryptophane you make me high
You lull me down and I wonder why
I wonder why, I wonder why, I wonder just why...
Hold me closely, don't you know I'm sick
