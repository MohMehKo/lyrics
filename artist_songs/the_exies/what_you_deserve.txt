Falling and unsure why am i losing my nerve
Wasting my time why do i only see this through the hurt

[chorus]
I cant get it out of my head i cant get it out that
I do this to myself me and noone else
So help me tell me how to break free
Im to blame and thats what really hurts
Thats what really hurts
You get what you deserve

Jaded and broken
Out of place waiting my turn
Guilty fractured
And like you i dont know the answer

[rpt. chorus]

I cant get it out of my head i cant get it out of my head
I heard the words you said to me

I do this to myself me and noone else 
So help me tell me how to break free
Im to blame and thats what really hurts
Thats what really hurts
You get what you deserve
