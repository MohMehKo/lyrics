My empathy, my empathy still makes me feel alive
And sufferin', and sufferin' is always on my mind
My empathy, my empathy still makes me feel alive
So who's the leader, I'm a leader fallin' far behind

I took it easy, took it easy wastin' all my time
Cuz I'm so lazy, I'm so lazy after all this time
I took it easy, took it easy wastin' all my time
So who's the leader, I'm a leader fallin'

Deeper and deeper
So tell me the reason for 
Livin' for givin'
Prefectin' my freedom
No leshes will keep us
Start up the end of
Deeper and deeper and deeper

Please don't stop, keep pretendin'
Don't look back, the world keeps changin'
Please don't stop, just keep pretendin'
I can't relate, no no!

This is for the moments that arrive without ease on (reason)
Gggggggood times and the bad
But believe me, I just can't relate

My empathy, my empathy still makes me feel alive
It sends a shiver, sends a shiver runnin' down my spine
My empathy, my empathy still makes me feel in love
So who's the leader, I'm a leader fallin'

Deeper and deeper
So tell me the reason for 
Livin' for killin'
And what you believe in
No leshes will keep us
Start up the end of
Deeper and deeper and deeper

Please don't stop, keep it diggin'
Don't look back, the world keeps changin'
Please don't stop, just keep pretendin'
I can't relate, no no!
