Fly alone
A careless soul
That sings for everyone
When the world closes

A steady blade
Tears the seal
A fallen angel
Selling secrets
We can steal

While brushing off the rust
We'll go insane
A beaten dog in anguish
Counts his days

So, come down with me
It's time to leave
Come down with me
I think we outta go
It's time to leave
