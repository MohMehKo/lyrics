Reckless and indiscreet, 
I'm hypnotized beyond belief,

Listen to my battle song, 
Cause it's dissin' you all night long

A new disaster's at my feet, 
of abusive things I can't believe,

Desperate and giving in, 
don't know where to begin,

it's hopeless, 
I'm caving in,
hopeless, 
I can't win

I'm going out of my head, 
I feel like I'm dead, 
I'm feeling Lo-fi

I bottle up and explode, 
my angels have flown, 
some things I can't hide
I'm feeling Lo-fi

Reckless and indiscreet, 
I'm hypnotized without release

I'm losing that special charm,
I'm played out I can't go on

Conversations without wings,
with much advice I start to scream,

Desperate, and giving in, 
I don't know where to begin, 
it's hopeless, 
i'm caving in,
hopeless,
I can't win

I'm going out of my head,
I feel like i'm dead,
i'm feeling Lo-fi

I bottle up and explode,
my angels have flown,
some things I can't hide
I'm feeling Lo-fi

I'm here, to get in sky,
let it fly
don't wait for no one that is why

I'm going out of my head,
I feel like i'm dead,
i'm feeling Lo-fi

I bottle up and explode,
my angels have flown,
some things I can't hide

I;m going out of my head,
and I feel like i'm dead,
i'm feeling Lo-fi

I feel it...
