Where you're headed there is no return
You're hell-bent on a crash and burn
You think you're winning but you won't be free
Until you realize there's no enemy

So live, live on through me
It's time to forgive, the creeper kamikaze

Going down on a one-way flight
You're just dying to be right
Your target's closing in that's a sign
Of moving foward on a slow decline

So live, live on through me
It's time to forgive, the creeper kamikaze
And give, give yourself to me
And everything you believe, well it's the creeper kamikaze

So forget, the things you can not hide
Cuz when the truth comes in, your soul opens wide

So live, live on through me
It's time to forgive, the creeper kamikaze
And give, give yourself to me
And everything you believe, well it's the creeper kamikaze

So forgive...
So forgive...
So forgive...
So forgive.......
