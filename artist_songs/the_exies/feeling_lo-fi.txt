It's about time, ready to break it
When I walk about I battle to make it
Doing what they call the best I can
You starfucker type caviar daydream
I'm gonna get away I say I said maybe
Blooming in the meadow
Think I'm leaving...and that's why
I'm going out of my head
I wish I was dead... I'm feeling Lo-Fi
I bottle up and explode
My engines have blown
So head down I dive... I'm feeling Lo-Fi
Crash boom bang can't remember my name
I hit it head on but I'm feeling no pain
What's it gonna take to make me free
Jump back, kick stop all the way
I bet you're guessing what I'm trying to say
Always a mystery everyday... and that's why
I'm going out of my head
I wish I was dead... I'm feeling Lo-Fi
I bottle up and explode
My engines have blown
So head down I dive... I'm feeling Lo-Fi
I'm here to blow it sky high and let it fly
Time waits for no one and that is why
I'm going out of my head
I wish I was dead... I'm feeling Lo-Fi
I bottle up and explode
And my engines have blown
So head down I dive... I'm feeling Lo-Fi
I'm feeling Lo-Fi
I'm feeling...
