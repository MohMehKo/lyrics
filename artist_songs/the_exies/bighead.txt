Oh, hey there Bighead
Bighead, you're alright
Wasted, feeling, feeling alright
Well he walks with his head up high
Flips a wink and wonders why
He never gets his wool
Maybe he's a stone-blessed pharoah tease
And maybe he speaks Manganese
She couldn't really care about it
Hey there Bighead
You Bighead, you're alright
He's wasted, but feeling, he's feeling alright
Well she drives with her eyes straight ahead
Always win cause she never said
Anything to lead you in
Out with her head up high, a tasty twisted lullaby
She couldn't really care about this
Hey there Bighead
You Bighead, you're alright
He's wasted, but feeling, he's feeling alright
When the jig is up you'll find yourself
With just your hand
By the Thermador you'll stay
Cause at least it keeps you warm
Hey there Bighead
Bighead, you're alright
When the jig is up you'll find yourself
With just your hand
By the Thermador you'll stay
Cause at least it keeps you warm
Yeah
Hey there Bighead
You Bighead, you're alright
He's wasted, but feeling, he's feeling alright
Alright, alright, alright
