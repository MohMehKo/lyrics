My Goddess
I was knee deep in a sick love
I was cross eyed under your drug
Schizo savior, mad messiah
Fatal worship you inspired

Gone, I don’t believe in you now
I’ve seen too much
I don’t believe in you now
My Goddess

You were counting on a freefall
You laid your bet I would lose all
Chalk up one less crucifixion
I kicked that sick, old addiction

Down, I don’t believe in you now
I’ve seen too much
I don’t believe in you now
My Goddess

Now you see what you get when you lose yourself
What you get when you don’t know who you are
when you don’t know who you are
My Goddess
