Your life, mislaid
Spoon-fed, well raised

[chorus]

Hey you youre nodding out
Whats this all about
Hey you youre nodding out
Whats this all about
Hey you! hey you! hey you!
Hey you whats this now
Going down going down
Are you sorry now
Going down going down 
Whats your story now
Going down, why do you want to die

Black tar in your veins
Once new, now staind

[rpt. chorus]

Your life, mislaid
Spoon-fed, well raised
Hey you
