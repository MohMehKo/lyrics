Got a head full of one-way rides
That you wouldn't believe
A giant leap from my heart to your arms
Before it's time to leave

Well, all these old things
That'll never be
That I'll never miss
Give me some time
And I'll throw a fists
Yeah I'll throw a fit
Yeah I'll throw a fit

This is the time when all things old will pass
Inertia comes around
To push me closer than I've ever been
We' ll move things, we'll be far
This is my chance to let the wall go past and then

Got a ticket on a Sunday drive
In the afternoon
There's nothing quite like your Indian smile
To elate my blues

Well, this is the time when all things old will pass
Inertia comes around
To push me closer than I've ever been
When new things will be found
This is my chance to let the wall go past

Inertia comes around, Inertia comes around, Inertia comes around.....comes around!

I'm over my head, I'm over my head
Still over my head!

This is the time when all things old will pass
Inertia comes around
To push me closer than I've ever been
When new things will be found
This is my chance to let the wall go past

Inertia comes around, Inertia comes around, Inertia comes around.... Inertia comes!
