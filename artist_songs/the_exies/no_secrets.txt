You've become a broke part of me baby
I've found my empathy in your abuse
I'm just a special effect to you lately
Am I nothing that's real or true to you!

Don't! Go! I thought I'd never tell
But it's something that you should know

I've got no secrets, I give myself away
I've got no secrets, and I give my whole existance to you
Get so damaged, watch me slip away
I get so damaged, drugged my whole existance, was you
Was you! Was you!

Now I'm lost in my wonderin' baby
Cuz I can't find the hope that's within me
And I'm scratchin' my bruises lately
My sincerety strands by and waiting

Don't! Go! I thought I'd never know
But it's something that you should tell

I've got no secrets, I give myself away
I've got no secrets, and I give my whole existance to you
Get so damaged, watch me slip away
I get so damaged, drugged my whole existance, was you!

I've done it again..... will someone tell me what I can do?!

I've got no secrets, I give myself away
I've got no secrets, and I give my whole existance to you
Get so damaged, watch me slip away
I get so damaged, drugged my whole existance, was you
Was you! Was you! Was you!
