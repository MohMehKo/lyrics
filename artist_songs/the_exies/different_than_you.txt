I used to hate you
With no reason why
I was so angry
So full of pride
Lost in opinions and innuendoes
Knew everything that you didn't know
And i used to think i was sure i was right
And that i knew the truth from a lie

I was so stupid when i was young
I was so stupid to think that i was

So different
So different than you
So different than you are
I know it's sad but true
So different
I'm no different than you

Was i just jealous, bitter a
And cold
The sins i committed
The lies that i told
Had no respect for you
Only myself
A memeory i'm not so fond of as well
And i can honestly say i was wrong
So can you forgive me so i can move on

I was so stupid when i was young
I was so stupid to think that i was

So different
So different than you
So different than you are
I know it's sad but true
So different
I'm no different than you

We are one in the same
Only with different names
Somethings are not worth changing
I learned to love by hating
We are one in the same
Your blood runs through my veins
Falls on deaf ears it's fading
I learned to love by hating

I was so stupid when i was young
I was so stupid to think that i was
So different
So different than you
So different than you are
I know it's sad but true
So different
I'm no different than you
