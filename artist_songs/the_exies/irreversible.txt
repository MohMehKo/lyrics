Turn, turn away
The first time, I can't say
But heaven knows, I'm fading
Before I go
Into these old shoes
I kissed away, all my years

Irreversible, always on my life
Irreversible, stuck in overdrive

One, one way ride
To the stars, of your eyes
To slip away, inside
Across time all gone
Saw the light of the wrong
Touch your skin, I cave in

Irreversible, always on my life
Irreversible, stuck in overdrive

But before I leave her
There is something you should know
How I feel our love will 
I'll take out
Within my sight
Lose all my sight

Irreversible, long it's on my life
Irreversible, stuck in overdrive
Irreversible, how it turns my life
It's you and I
It's you and I
It's you and I
