Worry - cause I
Don’t worry - cause I
Don’t worry - cause I got you.

Don’t you worry
Don’t you stress
Lives worth living even if its in a mess

Don't get trouble (Don't get trouble)
Don't get down (Don't get down)
My life better just because you’re around

Now I’m trying trying
Trying to find them words you’re hiding
Trying to find 3 words to let you know. Let you know
How I’m feeling, feeling can’t you hear my beating
Trying to find 3 words to let you know. Let you know

I’ll be your harbour 
If life gets harder
I’ll be your partner against the storm (do do do do do do)

I’ll be your shelter (be your shelter)
I’ll be your helper (be your helper)
I’ll be your partner against the storm

Don’t care for money
That ain't true
Need a money, to spend on you

You may think I’m stupid (You may think I’m stupid)
You may think I’m mad (Yeah I think you're mad)
But I don’t care cause life’s too short and I’m a happy man

Now I’m trying trying
Trying to find them words you’re hiding
Trying to find 3 words to let you know. Let you know
How I’m feeling, feeling can’t you hear my beating
Trying to find 3 words to let you know. Let you know

I’ll be your harbour 
If life gets harder
I’ll be your partner against the storm

I’ll be your shelter
