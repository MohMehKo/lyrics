Move to LA, Move to the sunshine
That’s what she said, Chance of a lifetime.
What did I do? I sit and wonder
Says it’s not me, it’s just the rain in London.

Her mind’s made up, she leaves on Monday,
She's coming back, she told me not to worry.
But all my plans are starting to come undone
I’d give the world to keep my girl in London.

So I lie and I say
It only rains in LA Everyday

If you go, then I know
It’s gonna probably snow,
So why don’t you stay…

It only rains in LA, Everyday
So why don't you stay.
It only rains in LA, Everyday
So why don't you stay

2 weeks go by, I get a postcard.
She’s met a guy, and he's a life guard
not coming back, says she's got my number
She'll look me up, next time that she's in London

Now you know, why I say,
It only rains in LA
I knew that you would stay!

Pack my bag, grab my coat - I’m gonna bring you back home
I’m off to LA

No one will love you more than me.
No one will love you can’t you see
I’m gonna stay in La until you see
No one will love you more than me.

It never rains in LA –
It never rains in LA So why don’t we stay
