Your smile warms me like central heating,
Hot chocolate on a frosty evening,
Warm breath cold lips that I’ve been waiting for,
All my life to kiss.

People pass by but we don’t notice,
I try, yeah I try but I'm just hopeless,
Hopelessly in love with, the girl here by my side,
On a cold dark Christmas night.

There's a little bit of Christmas in the air
There's a little bit of Christmas in the air
There's a little bit of Christmas in the air
And it feels so nice, loving you for the first time.

The shops open late and the school band sings a song,
A crowd gathers as the scout group marches on,
We'll meet our friends they’re drinking in the Swan,
I don’t know where the times gone.

The High Street's closed to all traffic,
We walk in the road and it feels like magic,
When I hold you close nothings ever felt so right,
On a cold dark Christmas night.

There's a little bit of Christmas in the air
There's a little bit of Christmas in the air
There's a little bit of Christmas in the air
And it feels so nice,
There's a little bit of Christmas in the air
There's a little bit of Christmas in the air
There's a little bit of Christmas in the air
And it feels so right,
Loving you so hard tonight,
Kiss you under Christmas lights,
It was the best night of my life,
Loving you for the first time.

So fall,
Won’t you Fall on me?
Cause I’ll be here,
With whatever you need
And I know it might sound stupid
But nothing felt so right
As loving you, on that cold dark Christmas night.

[Chorus]
