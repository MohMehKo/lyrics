I never wanted to forget that night we'd had
Dinner, dancing, drinks and then back to my pad
Well bang, bang, bang, who's the man?
You were a naughty girl, the best I'd ever had

Take off your clothes, take off your clothes, that's what she said (and come to bed)
Take off your clothes, take off your clothes and come to bed (that's what she said)
I've got my needs and I don't need sleep
Take off your clothes, take off your clothes and come to bed
It used to be just me but that's how one and one makes three

Three months later on the phone I've got your dad
He's not a happy man, no he was flippin' mad
He's got the hump and you've got the bump
And I've got you and you've got everything I had

Take off your clothes, take off your clothes, that's what she said (and come to bed)
Take off your clothes, take off your clothes and come to bed (that's what she said)
I've got my needs and I don't need sleep
Take off your clothes, take off your clothes and come to bed
It used to be just me but that's how one and one makes three
One and one makes three

Take off your clothes and come to bed
Take off your clothes, that's what she said
I've got my needs and I don't need sleep
Take off your clothes, take off your clothes and come to bed

Take off your clothes, take off your clothes, that's what she said (that's what she said)
Take off your clothes, take off your clothes, take off your clothes and come to bed (and come to bed)
I've got my needs and I don't need sleep (and I don't need sleep)
Take off your clothes, take off your clothes, take off your clothes and come to bed (and come to bed)
