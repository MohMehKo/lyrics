My heart still burns like a fire stir
The flames may go but the embers they still glow
And I know that I from the ashes will rise
love you and love you again

Haunt me like footsteps when you think that you're on your own 
You haunt me like footsteps and I still know 
And you're gone, it ain't funny
That I never heard you go 
Now you're gone, it ain't funny
That I never heard you go 

Try so hard to move my heart 
Dreams that we had when it first began 
I don't recognize myself that I can't hide that I love you 
Love you again 

Haunt me like footsteps when you think that you're on your own 
You haunt me like footsteps and I still know 
Now you're gone, it ain't funny
That I never heard you go 
Now you're gone, it ain't funny
That I never heard you go 

All night
I can hear you walking [x4]
