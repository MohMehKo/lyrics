I read the news today. The same old story John relayed nearly 50 years ago.
Nothing’s changed but time has flown. The English Army's won the war - Against whom?
Well no one's sure, but take a photo while you're there to show the world how much you care.
Each time I read the news it feels the same. I try and try but I can’t turn the page.

Three words Eight letters is the only thing that ever, the only thing that ever still makes sense to me.
Three words Eight letters, if you want her, go and get her, cause the best things in life are still free.
Don’t let the best things in life get away.

I read a thousands words on how dinosaurs rule the earth and why all those in charge are not trusted to drive a car.
I see the stars fall from the sky but no one else seems that surprised, what else can we do?
When you’ve put a man on the moon. Each time I read the news I feel the same. I try and try but I can’t turn the page.

[Chorus]

Don’t let the best thing is life get away,
Don’t take heed of anything they say,
Not tomorrow and not today,

Can you feel the love,
Can you feel the love,
Can you feel the love,
It’s falling out.
Can you feel the love,
Can you feel the love,
Can you feel the love,
It’s calling out.

[Chorus]
