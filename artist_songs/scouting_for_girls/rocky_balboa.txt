I've nothing left, nothing left you to do
but hang around trying not to think about you
I go over and you over and over it again.
Unlike me and this'll never end
It's last five minutes of the last five years
Rabbit in a hat she just went and disappeared
Now I'm broken, hoping you were just joking.
When you left you ripped me wide open

You can knock me down
But you can’t count me out.

Never gonna give you up
have you seen Rocky Balboa?
We can make a comeback
I know we ain’t over

You know this ain’t over

So here I am - I’m still on floor
I know I've sung this song a thousand times before.
But I can’t get over that fact that you're gone
I never will can’t move
It's last five minutes of the last five years
Rabbit in a hat she just went and disappeared
Now I'm broken, hoping you were just joking.
When you left you ripped me wide open

Sound the bell I'm getting back in the ring.
Come do you worst I want to feel everything.
I'll take the punches take left and your right
I'm not a soldier but I'm ready to fight.

She needs me, She tease me, She hold me, she leave me.
She love me, she steal me, she had me, she kill me
You can knock me down - but you won't count me out
