I still think about you, as I read through all your texts
The naughty things you would say around the time we first met
Yeah you said that we’d go all the way

I should have given you more; I should have begged you to stay
Another broken heart, another hopeless cliché.
With a kiss and a twist of the knife you were gone.

Now I can't do anything else but leave with a smile.
And hope that somebody else will come find me in a while.
Somebody new, Just just just like you
Somebody new, Just just just like you

Do you still think about me, or is it all about you,
It wasn't that long ago I was your somebody new.
Do you know what I’d give just to change your mind?

But I can't do anything but try and hold my head high.
And hope that somebody else will come find me in a while.
Somebody new Just just just like you
Somebody new Just just just like you

She'll do the things that you do
She'll need me like you used to
and I'll just pretend that she's you
If only she could be you

So while your falling in love, I'll be falling apart
Calling your name as I crawl back to the start
still wondering why. why why why

Did I give everything up?
Did I not give you enough?
You don't just fall out of love.
You wait till you find someone else.
