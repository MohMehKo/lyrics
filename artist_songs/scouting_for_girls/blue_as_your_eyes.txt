Am I falling apart?
Is this falling in love, am I going insane?
You scratched out my heart
You scratched out my heart, you etched on my brain

Every word
Every word that you said goes round
Round in my head
Round like a cyclone in my mind

Well I've been trying to get a hold on you
I've been trying to get a hold on you
I've been trying to get a hold on you
On this crazy world of mine

Every day, right from the start
When I showed you my hand, I gave you my heart
Falling in love, feeling alive
Clear as to mud, I'm blue as your eyes, blue as your eyes

Is it all in my head? 
You turned me away, you begged me to stay
Is it something I said?
You wanted to change, you wanted the same

Well I've been trying to get a hold on you
I've been trying to get a hold on you
I've been trying to get a hold on you
On this crazy world of mine

Every day, right from the start
When I showed you my hand, I gave you my heart
Falling in love, feeling alive
Clear as to mud, I'm blue as your eyes, blue as your eyes
