In my head, I keep my demons
You were the first, the first and last to see them,
You saved me and gave me everything I need,
You brought to my knees

You were scared and I was broken,
The words we shared and those we left unspoken.
Now I need you, to tell me, that everything's ok.
and you still want to stay

Without you Without you
I might as well give up
Without you Without you
I know I screwed it up.
But I'm wide open, still hoping
This is just a dream
One day I'll wake up and you'll be
naked next to me

I know you're gone, cause I'm bruised and bleeding
And though it's wrong, I keep believing
the next time, I see you, we can make it all O.K
Cause I wonâ€™t let you walk away

I know, I know we can make it
I know without you I'm naked.
I know, I know we can make it
I know I want you back naked.

I heard that love was a strange game,
And I found that time don't heal all pain
So I'll just keep breathing
I'll just keep breathing
until we meet again
