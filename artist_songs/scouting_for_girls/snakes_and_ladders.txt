Here we are, playing this crazy game,
We've come so far, but we're sliding down again
like Snakes and Ladders, all that matters is trying to get back up,
You making it so hard.
Why do you have to go and make this love
like snakes and ladders

It's always up and down with you, this game you play is kinda twisted,
Trying to guess your next move, as all I do cause I'm addicted
I could leave it all behind, trouble is I know I’d miss it

Cause even though you play me like an xbox
I don’t want you to take your hands off
me me me
cause I'm all about you you you
now I'm starting to see see see
You ain’t ever gonna lose lose lose

I’m running on adrenaline, you always make my heart beat faster
I’m living on a fault line just one step from disaster
I used to get some sleep at night, now look at the before and after
Cause even though you play me like an xbox
I don’t want you to take your hands off
me me me
cause I'm all about you you you
now I'm starting to see see see
You ain’t ever gonna lose lose lose

But you've only got to smile that smile,
and it's like I never fell before,
As long as you're the prize,
I'm gonna throw the dice.
I’m coming back for more more more
