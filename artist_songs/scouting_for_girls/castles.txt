I don’t know what I'd do without you,
But my heart’s been wearing thin,
I don’t know what else we could do,
To stop these walls from caving in.

It’s hard to keep your head above water,
So in love that you wanna drown.
Can anybody hear me calling?
Above the waves as they’re crashing down.

When you’re lost in love and waiting,
Trying to find a way to break you down,
Can’t you see there's no escaping now.

And I’m standing on the waterline,
Trying hard to ignore the tide.
But nothing’s ever gonna last,
If you think it's gonna break your heart,
You can’t say that I didn’t try
But I think we both realized,
That we’ve been building castles,
Below, below the water line.

I don’t know how to live without you,
I wouldn't know where to begin.
Cause everything I built around you,
Fell apart as we crumbled in.

Tell me how to turn the tide back,
You’re never gonna have it all.
I'd rather be below the surface,
Than trying to weather out the storm.

When you’re lost in love and waiting,
Trying to find a way to break you down,
Can’t you see there's no escaping now.

[Chorus]
