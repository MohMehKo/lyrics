Here's a song you can sing along to
For when I've gone away (for when I've gone away)
It's a silly tune I wrote for you (for you)
You can sing it every day (you can sing it every day)

I don't want to leave you (I don't want to leave you)
I don't want to leave you tonight
I don't want to leave you (I don't want to leave you)
I don't want to leave you behind
I don't want to leave you tonight

So if you're down and I'm not around
And the days seem far too long (the days seem far too long)
Well I'll be there if you're ever scared (ever scared)
You can hear me sing along (you can hear me sing along)

I don't want to leave you (I don't want to leave you)
I don't want to leave you tonight
I don't want to leave you (I don't want to leave you)
I don't want to leave you behind
I don't want to leave you tonight

And I know it's hard but life's a bit like that
When it pulls you down and stabs you in the back
And I know it's hard, we'll get through this I know
I didn't know you've been gone for so long (for so long)
I didn't know you've been gone for so long (for so long)
I didn't know you've been gone for so long (for so long)
I didn't know you've been gone for so long (for so long)

I don't want to leave you
I don't want to leave you tonight
I don't want to leave you
I don't want to leave you tonight
I don't want to leave you (I don't want to leave you)
I don't want to leave you behind
I don't want to leave you (I don't want to leave you)
I don't want to leave you tonight
I don't want to leave you (I don't want to leave you)
I don't want to leave you behind
I don't want to leave you tonight
