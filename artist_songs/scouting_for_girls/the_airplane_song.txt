She's a strawberry milkshake.
She's as sweet as a peach, but she's ice cold.
She never told me, she was leaving.
She left on a friday.
I went out for the day, and she left for the year.
She never told me she was leaving.
So get yourself on that airplane, coz its been far too long since you went away.
Get yourself on that airplane, coz its been far too long since you went away.
She's so extraordinary, she left last january.
And that's the reason I miss you so.
She's a messy creation.
She hit the road, but the road hit back.
Nobody told me, you're an island.
I will wait for a lifetime.
I've been counting the days, since you left one way.
Nobody reaches her island.
So get yourself on that airplane, coz its been far too long since you went away.
Get yourself on that airplane, coz its been far too long since you went away.
She's so extraordinary, she left last january.
And thats the reason I miss you so.
So give me a chance, I want you to know.
I won't love you and leave you, and then let you go.
I need to sort myself, can somebody show me the way.
And nobody knows the way.
Nobody know the way
Nobody know the way
Nobody knows the way
Nobody knows
You gotta give me a chance, and say you'll come home.
I won't love you and leave you, and then let you go.
You're always hard on yourself, nobody knows the way.
And nobody knows the way
And nobody knows the way
And nobody knows the way
And nobody knows the way
Nobody knows the right way
So get yourself on that airplane, coz its been far too long since you went away.
Get yourself on that airplane, coz its been far too long since you went away.
Get yourself on that airplane, coz its been far too long since you went away.
Get yourself on that airplane, coz its been far too long since you went away.
Get yourself on that airplane, coz its been far too long since you went away.
Get yourself on that airplane, coz its been far too long since you went away.
She's so extraordinary, she left last january.
And thats the reason I miss you so
