Bad guys - do what you like.
I'm getting high tonight on kryptonite.
Cause since the day that she left,
I’ve stayed in bed. I've been depressed.
You knew that I saw through walls
So what d'ya kiss him for? I saw it all.
And now if you're in distress
You're gonna have to find someone else instead.
The only time I use my X ray powers
Is when I think you're gonna take a shower

Don’t you understand - I'm just Bad Superman,
I'll do anything to get to you.
Don’t you understand - I'm just Bad Superman,
Getting over Louis was nothing compared to you.

Cause I'm bad superman,
Kinda sad Superman,
Just a man without you.
The only super thing about me, was you.

Was I a little intense?
You never liked me when I was Clarke Kent.
Was it because of the glasses?
It may sound weird but I had to ask it.
Cause I could always wear lenses,
I don’t know why my laser eyes never mended?
What's been happening to me?
But since you left I just turned really mean.
The only time I use my laser eyes
Is to make your new boyfriend cry.

Don’t you understand - I'm just Bad Superman.
And I’ll do anything to get to you

Don’t you understand - I'm just Bad Superman
Getting over Louis was nothing compared to you

[Chorus]
