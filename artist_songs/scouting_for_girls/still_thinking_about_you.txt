Since we met, there’s been one thing on my mind.
Not like that, but probably not far behind.
You’re the best, you’re the best thing I’ve ever known.
Don’t forget, don’t forget that I love you so.

I wake up
Thinking ‘bout you
I go to bed
The same thing is true
And in between guess what I do?
I’m still thinking about you.

I’m still thinking about you
It’s the only thing I know how to do
I’m still thinking about you
Still thinking about you

Since you left, there's still one thing on my mind.
Just like that, why you walked out of my life?
You’re the best, the best thing that I ever knew.
Don’t forget, I'll be here whatever you choose.

I wake up
Thinking ‘bout you
I go to bed
The same thing is true
And in between guess what I do?
I’m still thinking about you.

[Chorus]

When I’m at the end I know what I'll be doing
I will remember you face as I knew it
When I’m at the end I know what I'll be doing
I’ll be still thinking about you
I’ll be still thinking about you
I’ll be still thinking about you

[Chorus]

One year on I’ll be thinking ‘bout you,
Ten years on the same will be true,
Even when I’m Seventy Two,
I’ll be thinking about you.
