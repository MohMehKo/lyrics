There's too much light between us,
I'm trying to mind the gap.
I'd do anything to fix us,
Not just paper up the cracks.

Sliding doors are closing,
did I let you get away?
Theres a light in this tunnel,
but I think it's a train.

I'm missing our connection,
Theres something on the tracks.
It's me tied down begging,
for you to come right back.

I don't mean forever, 
Cus endlessly will do.
I don't care when you get here,
Just as long as it's soon.

And Now, You're Gone,
With bad goodbyes, 
I realise, I was stupid,
I was wrong.

There's something missing in my heart,
It's the bit where you are.
I need you back,
Please, Please Mind the Gap.

And I don't know where to start,
Never been this far apart.
I need you back,
Please, Please Mind the Gap.

Cus the Light between us Grows and Grows and Grows.

And I'm sleeping on the platform,
Cus I missed my last train.
You're the girl I'd do that for.
Do it every single day

Meet me at the station,
Underneath the clock.
I never give up waiting,
Cus you're my last stop.

And Now, You're Gone,
With bad goodbyes, 
I realise, I was stupid,
I was wrong. 

Something's missing in my heart,
It's the bit where you are.
I need you back,
Please, Please Mind the Gap.

And I don't know where to start,
Never been this far apart.
I need you back,
Please, Please Mind the Gap.

And the Light Between Us,
The Light Between Us,  
The Light Between Us,
The Light Between Us Grows and Grows, and Grows.

The Light Between Us,  
The Light Between Us,
The Light Between Us Grows.

Something's missing in my heart,
It's the bit where you are.
I need you back,
Please, Please Mind the Gap.

And I don't know where to start,
Never been this far apart.
I need you back,
Please, Please Mind the Gap.

Something's missing in my heart,
It's the bit where you are.
I need you back,
Please, Please Mind the Gap.

And I don't know where to start,
Never been this far apart.
I need you back,
Please, Please Mind the Gap.
