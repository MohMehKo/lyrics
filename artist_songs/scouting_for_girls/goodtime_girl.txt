No one knew your name or cared at school
Everybody knows the kids are cruel
You went from troubled teen and became a beauty queen
I got mixed up somewhere in between

Now I'm losing, I'm losing, my mind, yeah I'm losing
My mind is missing, presumed lost
Now I'm losing, I'm losing, my mind, yeah I'm losing
Don't want you back, no matter what

Woah
Everybody wants to know your name now baby
All I want to do is to forget (to forget)
Everybody wants to know your name now angel
All I want to do is to forget 

You took me in and shook me up inside
You got the stuff, the stuff that drives me wild
But you wanted headlines, you wanted bright lights
I was just your cheap and easy ride

Now I'm losing, I'm losing, my mind, yeah I'm losing
My mind is missing, presumed lost
Now I'm losing, I'm losing, my mind, yeah I'm losing
Don't want you back, no matter what

Woah
Everybody wants to know your name now baby
All I want to do is to forget (to forget)
Everybody wants to know your name now angel
All I've got are reasons to forget

She's cool, she's cruel
And that's how you fall under the spell of a goodtime girl (you got a goodtime girl)
She's keen, she's mean
Who knows where she's been? Is this farewell to the goodtime girl? (you want a goodtime girl)

I'm losing, I'm losing, my mind, yeah I'm losing
My mind is missing, presumed lost

Woah
She's cool, she's cruel
And that's how you fall under the spell of a goodtime girl (you got a goodtime girl)
She's keen, she's mean
Who knows where she's been? Is this farewell to the goodtime girl?

All I want
She's cool, she's cruel
And that's how you fall under the spell of a goodtime girl (you got a goodtime girl)
She's keen, she's mean
Who knows where she's been? Is this farewell to the goodtime girl? (you want a goodtime girl)

Now I'm losing, I'm losing, my mind, yeah I'm losing
Under the spell to the good time girl
