Take a chance, before it's gone
Throw me a rope or string me along
I'm nothing without you, this man is nothing without you
I know it's been a difficult year
It's been all I can do just to keep you near
I want you to know you're the star of my show

I sing these songs about you
It wouldn't be the same without you
I know you try to hide, I know you try to act tough

But take a chance on us (take a chance on us)
Throw your arm round love (don't give me up)
Let it pull you up tonight, take a chance on us tonight
But take a chance on us, (take a chance on us)
But I won't give us up (don't give me up)
Take a chance on us tonight, take a chance on us tonight

I always thought that we could make it through
If you gave me the chance, I always knew
I don't care what they say, you were mine all the way
And thought it seems like it's pouring again
You don't get flowers without no rain
Look what we've done, look how far we have come

Well I sing these songs about you
It wouldn't be the same without you
I know you try to hide, I know you try to act tough

But take a chance on us (take a chance on us)
Throw your arm round love (don't give me up)
Let it pull you up tonight, take a chance on us tonight
Take a chance on us, (take a chance on us)
I won't give us up (don't give me up)
Take a chance on us tonight, take a chance on us tonight

Take a chance on us 
Throw your arm round love 
Let it pull you up tonight
I know that times are tough (I know that times are tough)
I know we ain't got much (I know we ain't got much)
But I can't give us up tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

But take a chance on us (take a chance on us)
Throw your arm around love (don't give me up)
Let it pull you up tonight, take a chance on us tonight
But take a chance on us, (take a chance on us)
I know we ain't got much
I won't give us up tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
