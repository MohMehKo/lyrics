Mirror, mirror on the wall
How could I be such a fool?
Mirror, mirror I can't see myself no more

Breathe, breathe in
Welcome to a town called original sin
Breathe, breathe out
Easy getting in, it ain't easy getting out
Cry, out loud
If you're in for a penny, you're in for a pound
Don't, don't pause
You're just another sad case, another lost cause

Mirror, mirror on the wall
How could I be such a fool?
Mirror, mirror I can't see myself no more

A little mistake
That's how you caught me
Riding around with little miss naughty
A little mistake
Am I seeing double?
I see in your eyes you're gonna be trouble, you're gonna be trouble, you're gonna be trouble

Breathe, breathe in
If only you could see all the trouble I'm in
Breathe, breathe out
Another house of cards comes tumbling down

Mirror, mirror on the wall
How could I be such a fool?
Mirror, mirror I can't see myself no more

A little mistake
That's how you caught me
Riding around with little miss naughty
A little mistake
Am I seeing double?
I see in your eyes you're gonna be trouble, you're gonna be trouble

Mirror, mirror on the wall (you're gonna be trouble)
How could I be such a fool? (you're gonna be trouble)
Mirror, mirror I can't see myself no more (you're gonna be trouble)

A little mistake
That's how you caught me
Riding around with little miss naughty
A little mistake
Am I seeing double?
I see in your eyes you're gonna be trouble, you're gonna be trouble, you're gonna be trouble
