You came out of nowhere,
And knocked me down,
With a love so big,
It built a town,
All around me,
And it keeps me safe,
With you I've found my place.

Because home is wherever, I'm with you.
And I'll stay there forever, as long as you stay too.
I'm never gonna leave, it’s what I am, it’s where I’m from.
I found home, it’s you and it's all, it’s all that I want.

Walking round in circles,
All my life.
Trying to find you,
Trying to make things right.
I just wanted,
You to know,
That I loved you,
And that you’re my home.

[Chorus]

And every now and then I get lost on the way.
Trying to find myself a new place to stay.
No matter where I go I end up at the start.
‘Cause home is where the heart is, and you've always had my heart.

[Chorus]
