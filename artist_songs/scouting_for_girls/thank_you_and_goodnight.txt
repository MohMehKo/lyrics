So thank you and goodnight,
I never liked long goodbyes.
Turn the lights off when you go,
You were always my home.

So thank you and goodnight,
For the memories for the highs.
Who knows where this ends,
If I'll see you again.

So thank you and goodnight,
You've got a new mountain to climb.
Can you see what you've done?
I can die having loved.

So thank you and goodnight,
I wish I could stay by your side.
But we leave one by one,
Itâ€™s the same way we come.

Thank you and goodnight
I couldn't want more from my life
I'm no longer scared,
I'm just so glad you were there.

Goodnight
Goodnight
Goodnight

Did you know that night?
When you said goodbye,
That it was the last time,
That it was the last time.

Black and Blue in love, still with you I was, Black and Blue in love.

Goodnight
Goodnight
Goodnight
