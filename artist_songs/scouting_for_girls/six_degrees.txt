They say it’s 6 degrees
Between you and me
No matter where you are
No matter how far.

7 billion souls
Spread from Pole to Pole
From the city to slum
but I only need one.

So when you went away
Everything just changed
Six degrees apart
But it’s still too far.

I’m putting on a brave face, even though I’m falling apart
I’m putting on a brave face, it’s not a lot but at least it’s a start.
They say that I’m a lost case, and I’m losing myself in the dark,
But I’m putting on a brave face, it’s not a lot but at least it’s a start.

There’s only six degrees
Between you and me
We’re on the same path
You just got a head start.

But no matter where you run
We'll always share the same sun
And the air you breathe
Was maybe once in me.

And All I needed was you
