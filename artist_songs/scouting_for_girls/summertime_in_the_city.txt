Summertime in the city, all the girls dress hot,
Make the boys go silly, there they go,
Walking 'round the streets downtown on a wonder
Effect is on the shades, love in the summer
Hot hot hot, the temperature's rising
Give the guy a break, don't blame him for trying
Everybody's out, it's good for the soul
The sun on your skin and all the kids glow

Oh, oh, oh
Here comes the summer
Oh, oh, oh
Here comes the summer

Lunchtime in the city and we're getting in the mood
And we're getting there quickly, tipsy
Girls watch the boys, boys watch the girls
And no one wants to be by themselves in the water
Shorts on, shades on, I'm going to the park
Footy in the sun and the smell of the grass
New summer clothes, way off the load
And nobody here really wants to go home

Oh, oh, oh
Here comes the summer
Oh, oh, oh
Here comes the summer

Summertime in the city
Girls dress hot, boys go silly
Out on a wonder
Checking out the sides, love in the summer

It's summer, it's summer, it's summer in the city
It's summer, it's summer, it's summer in the city

Cups filling up in the evening, loving this feeling
New friends, old friends, heated
Gonna be a night to remember
I'll never meet a girl like you in November
The girl next door, she's a high street honey
She dress quite short and she thinks I'm funny
L.A., New York, Sydney, Rome
When the sun's in the sky, there's nowhere like home

Summertime in the city
Girls dress hot, boys go silly
Out on a wonder
Checking out the sides, love in the summer

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I hope that it doesn't rain
(It's summer, it's summer, it's summer in the city)
I hope that it doesn't rain
(It's summer, it's summer, it's summer in the city)
I hope that it doesn't rain

(It's summer, it's summer, it's summer in the city)
Summertime in the city
Girls dress hot, boys go silly
Out on a wonder
Checking out the sides, love in the summer

It's summer, it's summer, it's summer in the city
It's summer, it's summer, it's summer in the city
It's summer, it's summer, it's summer in the city
Hey there, miss sunshine
It's summer, it's summer, it's summer in the city
Hey there, miss sunshine
