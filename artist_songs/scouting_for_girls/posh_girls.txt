She passed, she's class
Candy for the eye and a twinkle in her smile
And she looks like butter wouldn't melt

He's bewitched, her daddy's rich
You can see she comes from money, but she's still a little honey
And it looks like butter wouldn't melt

He stuttered
'Oh I never thought I'd say this, but I think your so -
Awfully nice. Is that alright?' she said 'fine'

He was a little bit scared, a little apprehensive
He was just a boy from a local comprehensive

But he'd heard that
Posh girls have good manners, but they go like the clappers
Because they never got to hang around with boys at school
Posh girls have good manners, but they go like the clappers
Because they never got to hang around with boys at school

She seems, pristine, but don't be deceived, 'cause she's not that naive
Although it looks like butter wouldn't melt

He had a fright, that night
She'd opened his eyes to a world of surprise
And the butter, oh the butter it had gone, it had gone

She said 'oh'
With a twinkle in her eye, she said 'oh my -
Take me home tonight'

He was a little bit scared, a little apprehensive
He was just a boy from a local comprehensive

But he'd heard that
Posh girls have good manners, but they go like the clappers
Because they never got to hang around with boys at school
Posh girls have good manners, but they go like the clappers
Because they never got to hang around with boys at school

There's nothing like a little bit of class
Wrapped in a perfect arse
There's nothing like a little bit of class
The poor boy never stood a chance

Is it true what they say about posh girls?
Is it true what they say about posh girls?
Is it true what they say?
Is it true what they say about posh girls?

Posh girls have good manners, but they go like the clappers
Because they never got to hang around with boys at school
Posh girls have good manners, but they go like the clappers
Because they never got to hang around with boys at school

There's nothing like a little bit of class
Wrapped up in a perfect arse
There's nothing like a little bit of class
The poor boy never stood a chance
There's nothing like a little bit of class
They'll all said it's never gonna last
There's nothing like a little bit of class
Wrapped up in a perfect arse.
