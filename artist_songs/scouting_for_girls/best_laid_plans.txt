I love you so
Your heart is like gold and butter.
Soft to the touch
Need it so much
I want you.

But in my hands
The best laid plans
Just fall apart.

Tear me away,
back to the day
I lost you.
Give me a chance,
Time goes so fast,
I want you.

But in my hands
The best laid plans
Just fall apart.

Oh in my hands
The best laid plans
Just fall apart
Fall apart
