Neon lights
In your eyes
Lit up the darkness.
Just one kiss
Changed your life
That’s how it started.

Loving you was so easy
I couldn't stop even if I tried.

This is my vow
That I promise you now
This is my vow
That I won't let you down
Even if you break my heart
Tear my world apart
I’ll fix it somehow
Lying in the dark
Looking at the stars
I promise you now
This is my vow
This is my vow

You were right
When you said is life
Is what you make it.
Cause all I want is
All you got
It's not complicated.

Loving you is never easy,
I couldn't stop even if I tried.

[Chorus]

It goes on, it goes on, it goes on,
It goes on, it goes on, it goes on.

[Chorus]
