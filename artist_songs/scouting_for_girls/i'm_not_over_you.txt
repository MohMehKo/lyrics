I'm not over you, and I know that I should be.
I'm not over you, and I know that I never will.
I didn't know, you didn't hint, you didn't try to deceive me.
You just leave me.
You didn't call, you never phoned, you didn't say you were leaving.
You were busy. 
You said it was over, she said it was over.
But I don't believe her.
You said it was over, she said it was over.
But I'm not so sure.
Cause I'm not over you, and I know that I should be.
And I'm not over you, I know that I never will.
You used to say it'd never end, you used to cry I can't leave you.
I believed you.
But I'm so sure this isn't you, but I don't know how to reach you.
And I need to.
You said it was over, she said it was over.
But I don't believe her.
You said it was over, she said it was over.
But I'm not so sure.
Because I'm not over you.
Cause I'm not over you, and I know that I should be.
And I'm not over you, I know that I never will.
I'm not over you, I'm not over you, I'm not over you, I'm not over you.
You said it was over, she said it was over.
But I don't believe her.
You said it was over, she said it was over.
But I'm not so sure.
Coz I'm not over you, I'm not over.
I'm not over you, I'm not over.
I'm not over you, I'm not over.I'm not over you, I'm not over.
I'm not over you, and I know that I should be.
And I'm not over you, and I know that I never, and I know that I never, and I know that I never will
