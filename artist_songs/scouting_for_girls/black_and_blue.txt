Black and Blue in love
That is what I was
When you left that day.

Arrow through my heart
Tear my world apart
Since you went away.

Don't Give Our Love Away, Darling
Don't Give Our Love Away, oh Darling
Don't Give Our Love Away,
The last words I ever heard you say.

Bruised and broken love
Feel like giving up
Don’t know how to change.

Don’t know where to start
Mend these broken parts
No one left to blame.

Don't Give Our Love Away, Darling
Don't Give Our Love Away, oh Darling
Don't Give Our Love Away,
‘Cause a love like that it wont come round again.

Give me chance. Don’t walk away.
Cause tomorrow's a beautiful day.

Give me chance. Don’t walk away.
Cause tomorrow's a beautiful day.

Black and Blue in love
Yeah with you I was, when you went away.
