It was hard as we passed in the moonlight.
The hurt in your eyes; the stifled goodbyes.
And I knew, as you turned this was always.
No parting remark, no shot in the dark.

So take care of your love tonight.
Take care of your love,
‘cause I know, like a candle, it can flicker.

So take care of your love tonight.
Take care of your love,
‘Cause I know, if she goes, how you’ll miss her.

So make this one last.
‘cause love really hurts when it's past.

Life goes on, Now you’re gone, it gets better
The memories fade as the days pass away
I’ll catch myself smile, as I think, of a moment
That would make you laugh, and that breaks my heart.

I don’t care, I don’t care, I don’t care
If you keep me waiting.
