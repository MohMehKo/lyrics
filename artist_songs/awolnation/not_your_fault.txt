Yeah!
She was built with a brain
And some swagger.
A little scream, little cry,
Little laughter.
She's a ten,
I'm a joke in my own mind.
But she still loves to dance
With my punch lines.

(Punch lines, lines.
Punch lines, lines.)

This (this) love (love) found (found) us (us),
Now (now) I (I) seeeee (see) you.
This (this) love (love) up (up) down (down),
Please believe (please believe).

Baby, when I'm yellin' at you,
It's not your fault,
It's not your fault, yeah and
Baby cause I'm crazy for you,
It's not your fault
It's not your fault, yeah and,
Maybe I'm a little confused,
It's not your fault
It's not your fault, yeah and
Baby, it's a wonderful news.
It's not your fault,
It's not your fault, yeah.

Oh, it's not that you should care.
I just wanted you to know.

I'm a fight with myself,
Till I'm bleeding.
Just a taste of your skin,
Starts the healing.
Anyone from my past,
Get your ammo.
Find my sun in the dark side,
Of my shadow.

(Punch lines, lines.
Punch lines, lines.)

This love found us,
Now I see it.
This love up down,
Please believe.
