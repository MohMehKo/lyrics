Oh

Sit back and look for the warnings
The future's bright and alarming
Sit back and look for the warnings

Sit back and look for the warnings
The future's bright and alarming
Sit back and look for the warnings

Go
Woo
Huh
Cool

Uh,
Baby walkin' around with your head cut off
Baby walkin' around with your head cut off
Oh
Baby walkin' around with your head cut off
Baby walkin' around with your head cut off

Their power's fear
And it surrounds me
Their signs, you can see
One day we will wake the walking zombies
'Til then we pray
Oo

Everybody
Everybody

The king and his ghost are laughing at me
These signs, you can see
One day we will listen for the sirens
'Til then we pray

Skeletons
Marching army
Guns
Drop your feet
I'm scared
I'm Duke Ellington
My mother said there'd be days like this
But one of the fires lit made her piss
Calling all zombies
All up inside me
Transformin' vampires
Right beside me
And you can't run
'Cause, you did, you'd be dead
And them walls can't roll from the side of my head
I beat the ghoul
My beats are cool
But here's last kiss
All suckers
They will cease to exist
I can't entertain with a beat up human
Lay waste to cities
Leave towns in ruin
I
Am a
Ro-
Bot
Whole arsenal stock
Ready to blow
Lastly you see:
Me, be 3 by 3
Firing these things called TNT

Fire these things called TNT
These things called TNT
They call me TNT
These things called TNT

Uh,
We can dance like the world's over
Yeah, it's almost 2012
Call your girls over
Let's kick back
Pop shots
Have a ball
And if the world blow up
Next life, we do it all over
Uh, yeah, let's toast to the memory
I wrote my name in the sky, so remember me
Baby, forever we
Together mentally
The day I leave my baby over somethin'
Then hell'll freeze
Froze
This world Cole, like Natalie
So
Let's lose our clothes like Adam Eve
Back to the basics
Step out the matrix
Step out your cool
Baby, get on my spaceship
I seen her face lit
She seen a sign like a Mason
So we ran home like a base hit
Safe
Life is whatever you think it is
Yo, what you think this is?

Uh, yeah it's all in your mind baby
You gotta do what you feel, like a blind lady
You gotta spread your wings and just fly, baby
It feel like you're reborn?
That's my baby
She said she feel it in her soul like a vibrator
I got some things for your thoughts we can try later
Let's hit the dance floor
Right before we out of time
And just party like it's 1999
You know what Prince said
Girl, you my princess
I got the glass slipper
I hope the thing fits
Your body on fire
Let me extinguish
Hop on this white horse
Ride to the sunset

Is anybody really
Out
There
Breath-
In'
Is anybody really
Sick
Of
Bleed-

So come and scream into the
Sky
This

Touch

Come on down

The queen's heart
The knights of shame
The people's voice
So we pray and we pray
The queen's heart
The knights of shame
So we pray and we pray
The queen's heart
The people's voice
So we pray and we pray
The queen's heart
The knights of shame
So we pray, oh

Ooooooo

And yeah, it's no fun waiting for the fall
And there'll be no more waiting for you all
And there'll be one more chance for the truth
Without you
I would die
And yeah, it's no fun waiting for the fall

Waiting on a heartbeat
Is anybody listening?
We're waiting on a heartbeat
Can anybody hear me?

We rob from the rich to blow down the door
