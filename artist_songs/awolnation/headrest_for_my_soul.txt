There’s a leak in this boat
Someone toss me a rope
And a headrest for my, headrest for my soul

There’s a leak in this boat
How the hell will I float
With this headrest for my, headrest for my soul
I got a headrest for my, headrest for my soul

Let the whispers unfold
And darling do what you’re told
Headrest for my, headrest for my soul

If the hospital burns
If it’s really my turn
How the hell will I, how the hell should I learn

There’s a leak in this boat
Someone toss me a rope
And a headrest for my, headrest for my soul

Give me that headrest for my, headrest for my soul
You know I got a headrest for my, headrest for my soul
