This day feels anything but typical
Woke up choking on a miracle
I don't know why [3x]
I don't know why [3x]

My teacher told me what I'm made for
I beg to differ in the outcome
I don't know why [3x]
I don't know why [3x]

There's nowhere to run
When you're hiding from the truth
It's some kind of joke
When the tears are bleeding blue
Looking glass fire
When the pain is caused by you
It's some kind of joke [2x]

Ooww yeah oww yeah, alright.

I'm almost done with all my secrets
I'll take my time to fake a deep breath
I don't know why [3x]
I don't know why [3x]

There's nowhere to run
When you're hiding from the truth
It's some kind of joke
When the tears are bleeding blue
Looking-glass fun
When the pain is caused by you
It's some kind of joke [2x]

Ah, wait a minute

In a room full of red pretend to be dumb
We fall on our face pretend to be numb
In a room full of red pretend to be dumb
We fall on our face pretend to be numb

There's nowhere to run [screaming]
When you're hiding from the truth
It's some kind of joke [screaming]
When the tears are bleeding blue
Aw looking-glass fun [screaming]
Aw when the pain is caused by you
Sometimes we choke
And sometimes we choke

SING
SING
ALRIGHT
SING WITH ME
Sometimes we choke
It's some kind of joke
[Scream]
