New information is welcome everywhere I go
Sunset the preset
I’ve reset to the earth below
I’ve been involved with a couple humans out of reach 
At last, at least 
I’m amazed I still have air to breathe

I ran a hundred miles to loosen up my flow
I fell in love with a boat and flew back on a ghost
I’m fascinated when something gets the best of me
At last, at least
I’m amazed I still have air to breathe

I’ve been dreaming my whole life
My dream is to move ya
No more worries, no more cries
Addicted to the future
Any moment we can fly
Making love with the lights on
At last, at least
I’m amazed I still have air to breathe

You bet, I took a little trip to a gypsy on a beach
She only had a daughter and the sand beneath her feet
I swear she looked me in my eyes, baby
I felt a sudden rush cause life is getting shorter daily
There’s nothing wrong with you 
I still believe in you
I’m getting restless but I’ll wait for you to make a move

New information
New information
Everybody

I’ve been dreaming my whole life
My dream is to move ya
No more worries, no more cries
Addicted to the future
Any moment we can fly
Making love with the lights on
At last, at least 
I’m amazed I still have room to breathe

I’ve been dreaming my whole life
My dream is to move ya
No more worries, no more cries
Addicted to the future
Any moment we can fly
Making love with the lights on
At last, at least
I’m amazed I still have room to breathe
