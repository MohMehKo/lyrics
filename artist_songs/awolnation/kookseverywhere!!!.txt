The sweet sweet habit it feels like defeat yeah
The gold, cold blood, it covers my feet yeah
These bitches keep bitching and twitching their toes you know
I know that nobody knows so don’t go baby don’t go

Baby it’s gold blood, cold blood, gold blood, cold blood, gold blood, cold blood, gold blood, cold blood
Gold blood, c-c-c-cold blood, gold blood, c-c-c-cold blood, gold blood, c-c-c-cold blood, gold blood, c-c-c-cold blood

The gold, cold blood, the hole in her chest yeah
The rubies and gold are from the hole in her chest yeah
But if you learn something take nothing from me
I know that love is a terrible, terrible thing

Baby it’s gold blood, cold blood, gold blood, cold blood, cold blood, cold blood, cold blood, cold blood
Cold blood, c-c-c-cold blood, cold blood, c-c-c-cold blood, cold blood, c-c-c-cold blood, cold blood, c-c-c-cold blood

I’m sorry
Eyes are all around me now they see me now they don’t
Eyes are all around me now they’re looking at a ghost
Eyes are all around me now they see me now they don’t
Eyes are all around me now she’s looking at a ghost
And I cried I cried I cried cause I still love you the most
Eyes are all around me now they’re looking at a ghost
Eyes are all around me now they see me now they don’t
And I cried I cried I cried cause I still love you the most

Eyes are all around me now
Eyes are all around me
Eyes are all around me now
And her eyes are all around me cause she’s looking at a ghost
