Gotta keep it movin’
You know I feel responsible
Ever since I met you
I noticed I’m invincible 
I know you like it groovy
You know I’m more about rock'n'roll
Woo

Now that I’m improvin,’ yeah
They say that I have lost it all, oh

We’re hanging by
The shoestrings
The ones we love
Are holding
With skin and bones
And blue blood
It’s where we’re going 
Not about where we came from

I have your attention
Cause anything is possible
I swear that my intention
Is nothing short of probable
You think that I’m conceded
But maybe I’m just miserable 

Now that I’m improvin’
They say that I have lost it all, oh

We’re hanging by 
The shoestrings
The ones we love
Are holding
With skin and bones
And blue blood
It’s where we’re going 
Not about where we came from

The ones that we love are the ones that we hurt
I said
The ones that we love are the ones that we hurt
I said 
The ones that we love are the ones that we hurt
The ones that we love are the ones that we hurt

We’re hanging by 
The shoestrings
The ones we love
Are holding
With skin and bones 
And blue blood
It’s where we’re going
Not about where we came from
We’re hanging by 
The shoestrings
The ones we love
Are holding
With skin and bones
And blue blood
It’s where we’re going
Not about where we came from
