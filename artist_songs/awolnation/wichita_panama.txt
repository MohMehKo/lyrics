They say, they say, they say
In Wichita, in Wichita
I have no more friends
In Wichita, in Wichita
I have no more friends
In Wichita, in Wichita
I have no more friends
In Wichita, in Wichita
I have no more friends

In Wichita
In Wichita
In Wichita

That'll be the day
That rattles in my veins
I'm hiding in the shade
I've always been this way

They say, they say, they say
In Panama, in Panama
Don't have to pretend
In Wichita, in Wichita
I have no more friends
In Panama, in Panama
Don't have to pretend
In Wichita, in Wichita
I have no more friends

In Wichita
In Wichita
In Wichita

That'll be the day
That rattles in my veins
I'm hiding in the shade
I've always been this way

Your secrets come out
Your secrets come out
At night
Your secrets come out
Your secrets come out
At night
Oh, your secrets come out
Your secrets come out
At night
Your secrets come out
Your secrets come out
At night

That'll be the day
That rattles in my veins
I'm hiding in the shade
I've always been this way
