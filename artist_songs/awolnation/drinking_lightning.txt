In the valley, where my heart sinks
There will be no strings
I'm worth nothing
When the sad wind
From the night's end
Help me pretend
That I'm your sin
In the dark space
The touch of your soft face
In front of a fireplace
Would you believe me?
If the phone rings
Tell him nothing
Or maybe one thing
That hell is coming

'Cause he wasted your time
In a year you'll be mine
No you don't fare well
No you don't fare well
No you don't fare well without me

When I feel numb
From your answer
I'll take a gander
Appreciate your candor
If the glove fits
Above the tool box
You'll hear a pin drop
It's the sound of my thoughts
Now the pain cries
Down a cheek it dries
Oh the pink sky
And back little white lies
When my eyes sting
Where my heart sinks
There will be no strings
We're drinking lightning

'Cause he wasted your time
In a year you'll be mine
No you don't fare well
No you don't fare well
No you don't fare well without me

We're drinking your lightning
We're drinking your lightning
We're drinking your lightning
We're drinking your lightning

Oh...
No you don't fare well
No you don't fare well
No you don't fare well without me
No you don't fare well
No you don't fare well
No you don't fare well without me
