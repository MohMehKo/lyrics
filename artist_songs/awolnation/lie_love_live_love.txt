I’ve been waiting here for hours
Yeah I really love you so
This has turned into disaster lately
We’re the only ones who know

Lie love, live love, lie love thy neighbor

I’ve been wasting time for hours
Yeah this weight is all I know
This has turned into disaster
We’re the only ones who know

Lie love, live love, lie love thy neighbor [x3]

Cause I keep waiting on the eastern flow
Blow baby flow, flow baby blow
And I keep waiting for the eastern flow
And I keep waiting for the eastern flow
Blow baby flow, flow baby blow
And I keep waiting for the eastern flow
Still I keep waiting for the eastern flow

It just a Saturday night
It just another just another lover’s Saturday night

Allow me to explain
