Hold your head up high, everyone can see
Not afraid that I need your love
Raining from my eyes, crashing at my knees
Not afraid that I need your love

Holy Roller, blow me over
Holly Roller, blow me over

Wouldn’t it be nice drifting out to sea
With my swollen eyes I need your love
Tell me where you hide, tell you where I bleed
Maybe I’m too shy I need your love

Holy roller, blow me over
Holly roller, blow me over
Ahhhhahhhhahhhha [x3]

Holy roller, blow me over
Holly roller, blow me over

It’s a cold cold brutal world
Ahhhhahhhhahhhha [x3]
It’s a cold cold brutal world
