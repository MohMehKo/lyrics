All I need, all all I need,
All I need, all all I need,
All I need, all all I need...

It's early in the morning,
I'm laughing at the sun. 
My mirror disappoints me.
Am I the only one? 

All I need, all all I need,
All I need, all all I need,
All I need, all all I need...
Is you
smiling
at me, all all I need,
All I need, all all I need,
All I need, all all I need...
is life, love
with you

I think I'm getting closer
but the scenery's the same.
Am I a disappointment? 
I'll blame it on the pain. 
It's

All I need, all all I need,
All I need, all all I need,
All I need, all all I need...
Is you
smiling
at me, all all I need,
All I need, all all I need,
All I need, all all I need...
is life, love
with you

All I need is you
is all I need, 
if you could simply believe
in me and we would be forever
together

All I need, all all I need,
All I need, all all I need,
All I need, all all I need...
Is you
smiling
at me, all all I need,
All I need, all all I need,
All I need, all all I need
is you 
smiling
at me
all I need is you
is all I need
all I need is you
is all I need
all I need is you
is all I need
is life, love
with you.
