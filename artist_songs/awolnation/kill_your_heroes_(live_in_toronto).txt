And this is what it sounds like, when doves cry
Well, I met an old man dying on a train
No more destination, no more pain
Well, he said one day before I graduate
Never let your fear decide your fate

I say ya kill your heroes
And fly, fly, baby don’t cry
No need to worry cause
Everybody will die
Whatever you do just go, go, baby don’t go
Don’t ya worry, we love you more than you know

Well, the sun one day will leave us all behind
Unexplainable sightings in the sky
Well, I hate to be the one to ruin the night
Right before your, right before your eyes

You got to kill your heroes
And fly, fly, baby don’t cry
No need to worry, cause 
Everybody will die
Whatever you do just go, go, baby don’t go
Don’t ya worry, we love you more than you know

I met an old man dying on a train
No more destination, no more pain
Well, he said one thing before I graduate
Never let your fear decide your fate

You got to kill your heroes
And fly, fly, baby don’t cry
No need to worry cause 
Everybody will die
Whatever ya do just go, go, baby don’t go
Don’t ya worry, we love you more than you know
So you kill your heroes
Ooooh, ooh
Everybody will die
Oh, go, go, baby don’t go
Well, I love you more than you know
