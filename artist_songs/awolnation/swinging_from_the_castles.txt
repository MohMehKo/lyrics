The kids are, the kids are blowing up the castles
We're trading love, feeding baby for our hassles
It's not for me, it's only fit for our survival
The kids are, the kids are swinging from the castles
Swing, swing, they're swinging from the castles

A tomahawk and a fleet fox
Uproot it please
And let me see the nearest parks
This hit missed
And a karate kid
A remix
This is the end of original content

The kids are, the kids are blowing up the castles
We're trading love, feeding baby for our hassles
It's not for me, it's only fit for our survival
The kids are, the kids are swinging from the castles
Swing, swing, they're swinging from the castles

Holy fires
And mystical minds
The martyrdom dumb dummies
Frequent flyer, go-byers
I cry out
Came, punched April out
Know what version did you get
But the sucker's in the south

The kids are, the kids are blowing up the castles
We're trading love, feeding baby for our hassles
It's not for me, it's only fit for our survival
The kids are, the kids are swinging from the castles
Swing, swing, they're swinging from the castles

Please, please make that dirty preacher freeze
Please, please make that dirty preacher freeze
Please, please let that dirty preacher freeze
Jesus wrote my lyrical outro with the greatest of ease

The kids are, the kids are blowing up the castles
We're trading love, feeding baby for our hassles
It's not for me, it's only fit for our survival
The kids are, the kids are swinging from the castles
Swing, swing, they're swinging from the castles
We're trading love, feeding baby for our hassles
It's not for me, it's only fit for our survival
The kids are, the kids are swinging from the castles
Swing, swing, they're swinging from the castles
Swing, swing, they're swinging from the castles
