A riot, suggesting
Alone I’m protesting
There’s no one here standing
No loopholes, no branding
There’s no one here standing
No loopholes, no branding

I stand alone and curse at the sky
I stand alone beside you
I’ve never felt so alone in my life
Baby I stand alone beside you

Don’t look here too graphic
Like people, like plastic
Don’t look here too graphic
Like people, like plastic
So dance in the madness
Oh Lord did you plan this?
So dance in the madness
Oh Lord did you plan this?

I stand alone and curse at the sky
I stand alone beside you
I’ve never felt so alone in my life
Baby I stand alone beside you

Na na na naaaa ahhh
Na na na naaaa ahhh
La la la la

I stand alone and curse at the sky
I stand alone beside you
I’ve never felt so alone in my life
Baby I stand alone beside you

Oh
Burn the bloody house down
Burn the bloody house down
Burn the bloody house down
It’s good

So long flash
So long
So long flash
So long
So long flash
So long
So long flash
So long
Fuck

Woo!
Woo!
Woo!

Fuck your ghost
Fuck your ghost
Fuck your ghost
Fuck your ghost
