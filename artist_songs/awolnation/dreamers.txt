I got a lot to love I got a lot to lose
At this point in my life I’d rather die than lie to you
I’m gonna swim in hell I’ve gotta rebel yell
Na nan a na na

And now I got nine bloody dreamers on the dancefloor
Nine bloody dreamers on the dancefloor
Nine bloody dreamers on the dancefloor
Nine bloody dreamers on the dancefloor

I got a secret fan, IMAGINE that my man
There must be something in the air because I’m sick again
I’m gonna flood the well I’ve gotta rebel yell

And now I got nine bloody dreamers on the dancefloor
Nine bloody dreamers on the dancefloor
Nine bloody dreamers on the dancefloor
Nine bloody dreamers on the dancefloor

I’ll grab a pen and a pad baby now let’s go
I’ll grab a pen and a pad baby now let’s go

Nine bloody dreamers
Nine bloody dreamers
Nine bloody dreamers
Nine bloody dreamers on the dance floor

Fuck
Wait

And now I can see you
And now I can see you
And now I can see you
And now I can see you
