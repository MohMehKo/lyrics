Motherfucka let's show up tonight
You can call a taxi
I can ride a bike
Bazooka tube on my shoulder
It's getting colder
I need to hold her

Stop! Everybody just freeze
And kiss the sky and touch your knees
The radio is killing America
Can you feel the hysteria

Motherfucka are you listening to me
Motherfucka are you moving to the beat
Motherfucka time to take it to the streets
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Motherfucka play it on the radio
Motherfucka I will see you at the show
Motherfucka time to take it to the streets
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

When I run through the world
With my dick in hand
When I punch you in the face
With the bass and a plan
You will never be quite the same
Cause it's AWOL!
You can say my name

You were upside down
You were backside up
With the windows down
When the lightening struck
The great depression of the airwaves
So kill the suit and the DJ!

Motherfucka are you listening to me
Motherfucka are you moving to the beat
Motherfucka time to take it to the streets
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Motherfucka play it on the radio
Motherfucka I will see you at the show
Motherfucka time to take it to the streets
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
