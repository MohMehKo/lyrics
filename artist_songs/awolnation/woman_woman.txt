Last night I fell apart
Broke from my swollen heart
Born at a simple time
Raised with a simple mind

You may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman

I may be worthless without you
I'll never decide to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
Woman, woman, oh
I may be worthless without you
I'll never decide to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
Woman, woman
Woman

You may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman

Last night I fell apart
Choked on my drunken heart

I may be worthless without you
I'll never decide to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
Woman, woman
I may be worthless without you
I'll never decide to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
Woman, woman
Woman.

You may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman
You
Ah-ah-ah

Who's that woman, woman?
There's that woman, woman?
Be my woman, woman
Won't you see me in the dark?

Who's that woman, woman?
There's that woman, woman?
Be my woman, woman
Won't you see me in the dark?

I may be worthless without you
I'll never decide to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
Woman, woman, oh
I may be worthless without you
I'll never decide to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
Woman, woman
Woman, woman

You may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman
