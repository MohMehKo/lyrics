I’ve been running from it all my lifetime
There’s nothing wrong with you, I’m searching for my right mind
Oh, you should’ve seen it they were resting on the restless
This happened, literally - woke up I was headless
I woke up I was headless

[Chorus:]
Ima make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don’t bite no more
Ima make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don’t bite no more
Ima make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don’t bite no more
Ima make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don’t bite no more
Ima make a Ima make a bad wolf Ima Ima bad wolf Ima make a bad wolf Ima Ima
Ima make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don’t bite no more

You’re all still here

Motherfucker I’ll be back from the dead soon
I’ll be watching from the center of the hollow moon
Oh, oh my God I think I might’ve made a mistake
Waiting patiently was waiting taking up space
We are waiting taking up space

[Chorus]

The earth below is above my feet when the clock is laughing at me
When copy cats and the lazy brats are the last thing I want to see
No, my enemy is a friend of mine in a friendly place to be seen
Hey, you know I'll run away for a couple years just to prove I’ve never been free

They will never find me here [x4]

Yeah

Ima make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don’t bite no more [x8]
