[VERSE 1]
Been busy tryin' to figure you out
And how you ever did without the love and all the questions
Did he have the right intentions, no

So take a chance with me
I'm here so I can make you believe again in love that's true
'Cause I'll be there, I'll be there for you
Intro
Woah oh oh oh woah

[CHORUS]
You don't have to search no more
'Cause I'm the one you're lookin' for
Oh I'll be there, I'll be there for you
You just have to realize 
I'm not like those other guys
'Cause I'll be there, I'll be there for you

Woah oh oh oh, woah
I'll be there I'll be there for you
Woah oh oh oh, woah

[VERSE 2]
I'm gonna bring you back, bring you back now
To a time that was right oh you never had to worry 'bout
Anything your heart desires
If you just ask then I'll supply it

I'll treat you right
'Cause I'm your knight
And you're my princess baby
Put your guard down be my lady

[CHORUS]
You don't have to search no more
'Cause I'm the one you're lookin' for

And if I can remind you how it feels
How it feels to be another's number one
And it's time to break that spell
I've been wishin' down this well
Ohh, and it's all for you, you

You don't have to search no more
'Cause I'm the one you're lookin' for
