Starrin' at the world
You don't know where you are
Is it all just glamour jounce and drive on fancy cars
To keep up with the pace
The paddles to the floor
You can't make out the difference
You want it all the moon
Is it all in vein, are we misses something here

Just let me see your face, let me see your heart
Let me see what's inside
Cause I'm breaking down your walls
The windows through your eyes
You can see it all
Just look within yourself 'cause I'm breaking down your walls

Everything around you turns in shades of grey
The colour that was once then
They're all keep gone away
To keep up with the pace
You running at the door
You run in two places
That wasn't there before
Is it all in vein, are we misses something here

Just let me see your face, let me see your heart
Let me see what's inside
Cause I'm breaking down your walls
The windows through your eyes
You can see it all
Just look within yourself 'cause I'm breaking down your walls, breaking down your walls

Don't have to find, bother me
It's time to showing me

So I let you see my face, let you see my heart
Let you see what's inside, 'cause I'm breaking down your walls
The windows through your eyes
You can see it all
Just look within yourself 'cause I'm breaking down your walls...
I'm breaking down your walls
Oh no no...
I'm breaking down your walls...
Mhhm... mmhm
'Cause I'm breaking down your walls
