I was standing on the other side
Watching you leaving
I couldn't see you go
You know that I was so sincere when
I said I need you here
â€˜Cause this is your home now
You're the one my everything
If you stay you'll make me sing

[Chorus:]
I'll give you my life
I'll give you my heart
Nothing will ever come between us
Ever come between us
Tonight, I'll show you the way
Just (promise me that you'll) promise me that you'll stay
Promise me that you'll stay

When you're with me I feel so alive
You're the Bonnie to my Clyde
We can paint the town
But you're so far. You're so far
And that can't even hold me down
You're the one my everything
If you stay you'll make me sing

[Chorus:]
I'll give you my life
I'll give you my heart
Nothing will ever come between us
Ever come between us
Tonight, I'll show you the way
Just (promise me that you'll) promise me that you'll stay
Promise me that you'll stay

And I know that I found so true
You are to me as I am to you
And I know that we can't just stay
Even though we ain't together
Our love still remains

[Chorus:]
I'll give you my life
I'll give you my heart
Nothing will ever come between us
Ever come between us
Tonight, I'll show you the way
Just (promise me that you'll) promise me that you'll stay
Promise me that you'll stay
