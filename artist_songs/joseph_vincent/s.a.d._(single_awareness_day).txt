I feel that I should tell ya
A warning to prepare you
About this song, it's when love goes wrong, but I'll carry on

I gotta keep it real
Of how I really feel
About this day, I don't want it to stay, so please go away

[PRE-CHORUS]
When cupid aimed his arrow at me
He missed by a 100,000 feet

[CHORUS]
This ain't a song about love, it's the actually opposite I'm thinkin' of
I don't care about the cards, or candy hearts, oh no no no I'll tell you right from the start
Oh, reminds of how I don't have a date, the 14th of February gets in the
way cause for me, It's Single Awareness Day

With all the red and pink
It's just so hard to think
Oh why should I care, about what I should wear, for nobody who's there

I need love,
I need you 
I need some one to hold me too

I need love
It's so true
I need ya to say I love you

[CHORUS]

S.A.D No valentine for me
And Imma be alright if you could only see
That today's just a day and if it's meant to be 
There's always next year, just wait and see

[CHORUS]
