Through all of time and space
I'd always rearrange
Everything around me, so things would go as planned
But I found clarity
Some things aren't meant to be
Take it as you go on
Your future's in your hands
And all we want is love
So as I look above

Oh it's the stardust in the sky that
Makes me realize that
I'm not the only one
And just know that dreams come true
So make sure every single thing that you do
Just take your time
And look up at the stars tonight

I've never wanted more than
To show the world what I can do, to make them see
That we're just all unique in our own ways
To do what we were made to do
And it's our destiny to find out what we were meant to be
I look up and I see that...

It's the stardust in the sky that
Makes me realize that
I'm not the only one
And just know that dreams come true
So make sure every single thing that you do
Just take your time
And look up at the stars tonight

Yeah if you're on your own
And don't know where to go
Just know you're not alone
Just know you're not alone
Said if you're on your own
Well you can make it home
Just know you're not alone
And one thing that's for sure
If you could ask for anything more
Just take your time
And look up high
It's in the stars tonight
