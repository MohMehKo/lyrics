I'll admit that heaven is a place I've found
No it ain't a bed of clouds high off the ground
Baby it's just you sitting right next to me
And there's nothing else I need

It's the simple things from me
'Cuz baby you too good I cant let you go

And oh, everything's so clear
I've got you standing here
It's time for me to let you know that
I can't let this chance go by
I need you in my life
Five more words I'll say to show that
All, all I wanted was you

Everything you stand for and your classy style
You can flip a messed up day with just one smile
I don't have to tell you 'cuz you already know
Oh, it's you I've been waiting for
And I don't know what took me so long
'Cuz baby you too good I can't let you go

And oh, everything's so clear
I've got you standing here
It's time for me to let you know that
I can't let this chance go by
I need you in my life
Five more words I'll say to show that
All, all I wanted was

To tell you how could you not know
I gave you all the signs just pointed where to go
But you played my game right back at me
I never thought that I would finally get you to be my queen

Oh, everything's so clear
I've got you standing here
It's time for me to let you know that
I can't let this chance go by
I need you in my life
Five more words I'll say to show that
All, all I wanted was, all I wanted was you
