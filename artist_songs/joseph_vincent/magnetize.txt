Your fire, my ice
It's your heat that keeps melting me down
But your day to my night
Gives me hope light will come around
Your skin, my touch
Sometimes deserts just need some rain
But I know your love
Pleasure comes with the pain

'Cause you and me
Are a double charged battery

[Chorus:]
You think that we're too different in between
And you say that you and I will never make it
But I claim that opposites work if they try
'Cause you and I magnetize

My sun, your moon
With the gravity of the earth
Align for two
It's you and me up against the world
Can't you just see
That you're the harmony to my melody and
I'll always need
Your heart to my beat

'Cause you and me
Are a double charged battery

[Chorus]

The attraction's getting stronger can't escape it now
Pullin' closer yeah it's magnitude is coming down
In the moment that we're in no polar opposites can
Block that, block that, no block it now
Here's my formula just take it get the answer right
You can do the math satisfaction multiplies
Here's the plan just divide the sheets, subtract the shirts and T's
And add in you and me
Said I'm laying it down and letting it go
We're one in the same, too stupid to know
I'm keeping it high by taking it low

[Chorus x2]
