Here's a story about a boy who
Found love with a girl
And when they're both together
Yeah, they rock each other's world
So in love and so alive
So many ways to make sure that she knows
He tells her every single day

Girl, you make me feel so good
Oh, you make me feel so good

Cause it’s a
Roller coaster ride
Up and down and side to side
You take me off the track
Now, bring it on back
Bring it on back, girl
You make my heart race fast
I want for us to last
I don’t know what else to do
Cause I’m falling in love with you

Now it ain’t
Always gonna be sunny days
We gotta make it through the storm
(Through the storm, through the storm, yeah)
And when the sun is gone
Just know that I will be the one to keep you warm
(Keep you warm)

Cause I don’t care
Rain or shine
Baby, all I need is time
I can’t get through anything
As long as you’re around

Girl, you make me feel so good
Oh, you make me feel so good
(Oh yeah)

Cause it’s a
Roller coaster ride
Up and down and side to side
You take me off the track
Now, bring it on back
Bring it on back, girl
You make my heart race fast
I want for us to last
I don’t know what else to do
Cause I’m falling in love

Oh
I’m falling in love with you

And if we ever grow apart
Remember how we were from the start
We’re living life on the edge
Use your heart, not your head
Don’t hold back, no regrets
Like I said

Cause it’s a
Roller coaster ride
Up and down and side to side
You take me off the track
Now, bring it on back
Bring it on back, girl
You make my heart race fast
I want for us to last
I don’t know what else to do
Cause I’m falling in love

Oh
I’m falling in love
With you
Whoa
