[VERSE 1]
No matter where I go 
There's always one thing that I'll know 
That it's you, this much is true 

And no I cannot complain 
Cause it's so easy to maintain 
The things in my life when I'm with you 

[PRE-CHORUS]
And I can't get enough, since you stung me with your love 

[CHORUS]
You're my bumble bee, and I can say right now 
We'll fly together, makin' honey with our nectar. 
And I can finally see, with my hexagonal eyes 
You're fine, be mine, cause you're my bumble bee 

[VERSE 2]
See we started off friends but I could pretend 
I knew you were for me 
And no I'll never ever find 
A prettier bumble bee 
Oh I can't deny, I'll always need you by my side 
And you know it's right, we even got some matchin' stripes 
No I can't deny, that we're just friends is such a lie 

[PRE-CHORUS]
And I can't get enough, since you stung me with your love 

[CHORUS]
You're my bumble bee, and I can say right now 
We'll fly together, makin' honey with our nectar. 
And I can finally see, with my hexagonal eyes 
You're fine, be mine, cause you're my bumble bee 

[BRIDGE]
It is time to realize, that we are more than this, we're more than ordinary 
Friends, I'll say it all again you know it's true, cause you feel the same 
Way too 

[CHORUS]
You're my bumble bee, and I can say right now 
We'll fly together, makin' honey with our nectar. 
And I can finally see, with my hexagonal eyes 
You're fine, be mine, cause you're my bumble bee
