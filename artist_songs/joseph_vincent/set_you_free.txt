Don’t stop 
Move it, move it 
I just love the way you do it 
Baby, when you walk in the club 
See these eyes, they staring back 
Giving me a heart attack 
Girl, I know you’re looking for love 

But you won’t, you won’t 
Find what you’re looking for 
Cause your heart, your heart 
Is always needing more 

Oh, cause your heart is looking for love 
You’re looking in the wrong place 
You’d be better off looking my way 
Through the day 
Into tonight 
Cause love is all you need, yeah 
And you can find it from me 
Oh no, no, no, no 
Oh no, 
I’m here to set you free 

I’m here to set you 
Set you free 

I see you talking to another guy 
And it doesn’t feel alright 
Cause baby he can’t do it from you 
So take a step right over here 
And I’ll make it very clear 
You only gotta follow my rules 

I said you gotta, you gotta be down 
To always be messing around 
Keep tearing up this dance floor, you’ll see 
We dancing and dancing 
We keep on moving and moving 
And by tonight, oh baby leaving with me 

And I know, I know 
What I have to do 
Cause my heart, my heart 
Has been longing to find you 

Oh, cause your heart is looking for love 
You’re looking in the wrong place 
You’d be better off looking my way 
Through the day 
Into tonight 
Cause love is all you need, yeah 
And you can find it from me 
Oh no, no, no, no 
Oh no, 
I’m here to set you free 

Free from all the lies 
Free from all the pain 
Free to tell you why, oh why 
Oh, never gonna let you 
Never gonna let you 
Never gonna let you down 

Cause your heart is looking for love 
You’re looking in the wrong place 
You’d be better off looking my way 
Through the day 
Into tonight 
Cause love is all you need, yeah 
And you can find it from me 
Oh no, no, no, no 
Oh no, 
I’m here to set you free
