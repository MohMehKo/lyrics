I saw you walkin' down the street
I think I finally get to meet
My lady for the very first time
I want you for myself to keep
Those legs oh no they get me weak
Can't take it no you can't be denied

Here's my chance right now
you'll be my girl somehow

You know I'll treat you with respect
With me oh no you you won't regret
Can make our time together worthwhile
And baby oh I promise you
I'll do anything you want me to
Just ease on up and let me inside

And the you'll finally see
That you belong with me

Oh and together we'll
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
You know it feels so right
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
I'll take you home tonight

Listen to the beat of your heart
Oh you know it's racin' so much faster than a speedin' car
So you better get ready for losin' the steady today
And know that my love is true
I'd trade every single thing I have for a moment with you
I'll give it to you so hard then you'll say

Life should have no boundaries
So come one down spend it with me
Don't think about it for a minute
Now I'm gonna let you in it

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
You know it feels so right
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
I'll take you home tonight

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
(ooooooooooooo)
