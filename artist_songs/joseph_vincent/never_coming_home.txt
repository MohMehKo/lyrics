Why won't you tell me if we ain't fine
It's hard enough for me to read your mind
Oh I know, you're never ever comin' home

I feel like we can never be
A future with you is just so hard to see
'Cause I know, you're never ever comin' home

Oh you got me danglin' on your string
I'm not goin' to take no more, Yeah I'ma do my thing
'Cause on day baby, soon you'll see
That you'll never find someone like me

Sing woah (-oah-oah) baby oh I gotta go
Hey (-ey-ey) no it's not okay
Beacuse I know (-oh-oh) that you're never comin'
That you're never, never ever comin' home

Oh you're goin' back and forth why's it so hard to decide
You know that I'm the only one who blows your mind
No it ain't, it ain't greener on the other side

Oh I need (need need need) need it now
A reason why you left oh baby tell me how
Oh I know, you're never ever comin' home, woah, oohhh

Sing woah (-oah-oah) baby oh I gotta go
Hey (-ey-ey) no it's not okay
Beacuse I know (-oh-oh) that you're never comin'
That you're never, never ever comin' home

Oh I know you're gonna leave girl
I've come to grips with that, no you won't come back
Baby that's a fact, oh I know
All alone, 'Cause you're never ever comin' 
Never ever comin' home

Sing woah (-oah-oah) baby oh I gotta go
Hey (-ey-ey) no it's not okay
Beacuse I know (-oh-oh) that you're never comin'
That you're never, never ever comin' home
