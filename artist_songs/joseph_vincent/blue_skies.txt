I wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' about oh how I'm gonna live today
I'm just so sure I know it
That oh someone somewhere is out there comin' my way

Oh to my side of the world
I know I'll find my girl
As the clouds will roll away
I can finally say, I got my

Blue skies, brown eyes
Baby you're my perfect day
Blue skies, brown eyes
You're so perfect in every way I know I can't deny
Been dreamin' 'bout you all my life
And now's my chance to say, my chance to say
Oh baby you're my perfect day
(Yah-ah-ah) baby you're my perfect day

See I don't got no problem
With what you have in store
'Cause it's what I'm feenin for and I

Can tell you I've been waitin', waitin', waitin'
For you to come around
Turn my life right upside down

To the bottom of the sea
With the sky beneath my feet
As the clouds will roll away
You can hear me say I got my 

Blue skies, brown eyes
Baby you're my perfect day
Blue skies, brown eyes
You're so perfect in every way I know I can't deny
Been dreamin' 'bout you all my life
And now's my chance to say, my chance to say
Oh baby you're my perfect day
(Yah-ah-ah) baby you're my perfect day

I can't believe 
That you're finally in my life
Oh 'Cause I won't ever take for granted
The time we have is all we have and 
Look at us now 'cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I
Oh I got my

Blue skies, brown eyes
Baby you're my perfect day
Blue skies, brown eyes
You're so perfect in every way I know I can't deny
Been dreamin' 'bout you all my life
And now's my chance to say, my chance to say
Oh baby you're my perfect day

Blue skies, brown eyes
Baby you're my perfect day
Blue skies, brown eyes
baby you're my perfect day

Blue skies, brown eyes
Baby you're my perfect day
Blue skies, brown eyes
baby you're my perfect day
