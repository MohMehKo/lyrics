Take a look around and you'll see
That in front of me, this'll be
Another thought out melody
Take another chance with me

It's alright to try somethin' new
For a minute, one livin'
For more than what she needs
For more than just a dream

Wait as long as I can try
Until that perfect time

Since that day I saw you walk away
Not a moment has passed
That I haven't asked myself, oh why
Takin' all my time, and it hasn't left my mind
'Cause that was the thing, thought I was your king
Hopin' that you would be my queen

Don't stop keep on movin'
And just know that in time it will pay off
And you will just make it on out, make it alright
And you know, there's so much left to go
So don't hold yourself back
Keep your mind on track
And you'll be on your way 

Since that day I saw you walk away
Not a moment has passed
That I haven't asked myself, oh why
Takin' all my time, and it hasn't left my mind
'Cause that was the thing, thought I was your king
Hopin' that you would be my queen

Be my everything, my whole life
But then you slipped away
One things for sure
I gotta let you go

Since that day I saw you walk away
Not a moment has passed
That I haven't asked myself, oh why
Takin' all my time, and it hasn't left my mind
'Cause that was the thing, thought I was your king
Hopin' that you would be my queen
