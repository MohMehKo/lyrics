You, you I’ve been fighting for
You can’t be defeated, 
When you’re In Love
You, you’ve been craving for
You know that you need it,
When you’re in love.

You, you I’ve been searching for
You know you can find it
When you’re in love.
You, oh you’ve been waiting for
Waiting for the chance to make your move
It started off with just one look. 

[Chorus:]
I can’t describe this feeling, 
It’s a moment, a chance, it’s a time to dance
It’s the first time we locked lips and now;
I, I feel like I am dreaming
That’s why-y-y I can’t get enough
That’s how it feels when you’re in love

Woah-oh-oh [x3]

You, you have been fallin, fallin, fallin
Fallin for the one who’d catch you before you’d hit the ground
You won’t ever get that one, unless you go and make 
your move, it started off with just one look.

[Chorus:]
I can’t describe this feeling, 
It’s a moment, a chance, it’s a time to dance
It’s the first time we locked lips and now;
I, I feel like I am dreaming
That’s why-y-y I can’t get enough
That’s how it feels when you’re in love
Oh-oh-oh [x3]

That’s why-y-y I can’t get enough [x3]
That’s how it feels when you’re in love
