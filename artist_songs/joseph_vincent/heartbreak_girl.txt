She's standing over there not looking at me 
It drives me crazy that this feeling won't leave 
She's walking past me, she's what I adore 
She bites her lip, gives me a wink, I'm yearning for more 
Well she's a lady that's hard to resist 
She's not just someone you could pass up and miss 
The touch of her skin makes me curl up inside 
So knock it off stop playing with me 
Let's go for a ride 

She's a heart breaker 
You better believe 
She's not gonna stop oh and she's coming for me 
And you never know, it's so true 
Cause when she's done with me then she'll be coming for you 
She’ll be coming 

Well she's relentless it should be a crime 
It's not her fault oh it's just how she's designed 
How can something bitter be so sweet 
She'll make you fall in love and then she'll get up and leave 
Oh she’s gonna leave 

She's a heart breaker 
You better believe 
She's not gonna stop oh and she's coming for me 
And you never know, it's so true 
Cause when she's done with me then she'll be coming for 

Well, she hasn’t felt what it feels like 
To be played like a fool 
Oh, she doesn’t know all the things 
That she caused you and put you through 
So it’s time to go 
Cause now you know 

She's a heart breaker 
You better believe 
She's not gonna stop oh and she's coming for me 
And you never know, it's so true 
Cause when she's done with me 
No, no, no, no 
When she’s done with me 

Well, she's a heart breaker
