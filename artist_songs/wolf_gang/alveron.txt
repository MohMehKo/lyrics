How long since we were young?
We both got caught in the thunderstorm
And you sent me those words just to keep me warm
You said, "One day I'll find my way and meet you there
When I climb these gates. And I will never hang my head in shame."

Oh, life is but a dream as the saying goes.
You don't have to wake up tonight.

Cause when all is lost there's much to gain
Can you hear the future call your name?
But I hope, I hope we'll still remain
Singing "Alveron, Alveron"

Well they say the pen's stronger than the sword
But they burned all the books to rewrite the law
Now it's hard to tell what we're fighting for

But I've walked right through these lands
And I believe in the faith of the fellow man
As he gives with his heart and heals with his hands

Life is worth more than it's waiting for
And I'll carry your share tonight

Cause when all is lost there's much to gain
Can you hear the future call your name?
But I hope, I hope we'll still remain
Singing "Alveron, Alveron"

And we'll sing "Alveron, Alveron"
And we'll sing "Alveron, Alveron"
And we'll sing "Alveron, Alveron"
And we'll sing "Alveron"
Oh

Cause when all is lost there's much to gain
Can you hear the future call your name?
But I hope, I hope we'll still remain
Singing "Alveron, Alveron"

Cause when all is lost there's much to gain
Can you hear the future call your name
But I hope, I hope we'll still remain
Singing "Alveron, Alveron"
Singing "Alveron, Alveron"
Singing "Alveron, Alveron"
