Underneath the night I stare down at the city lights
I knew the day would come when your words hit me with surprise
Well, your life is what you make it with reasons to believe

You always said you’d never grow old in the streets below
But now the grades of time are moving faster than before
Well, your life is what you make it with reasons to believe

But if you could believe in, if you could believe in me

So turn your face away, tell me that you never cared
Speak a line say I’m right before you disappear
With your arms around my shoulders there were reasons to believe

But if you could believe in, if you could believe in me
But if you could believe in, if you could believe in me

Nothing but your doubt can take you from in love
Let it go, let it go
If you can’t believe, I know you won’t be free to let go
Let me go

And if you could believe in, if you could believe in me
And if you could believe in, if you could believe in me
