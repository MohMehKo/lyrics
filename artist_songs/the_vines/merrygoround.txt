On a merrygoround
Runnin' in to all the people you wanna
And what it's all about
Wasn't anythin that you thought or knew...nothin'

Here we go round the merrygoround
Here we go round the merrygoround

On a merrygoround
Runnin' into people that you don't wanna
And the place that ya found
Wasn't anywhere that you thought
Or you knew nowhere

Here we go round the merrygoround
Here we go round the merrygoround

I don't know what is up
I don't wanna know

Here we go round the merrygoround
Here we go round the merrygoround
