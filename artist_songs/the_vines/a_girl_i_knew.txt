Ally was a girl I knew
Took my heart and tore it in two
There are things I couldn't say
There are times I feel ashamed

Marriage was a think we had
Hurt so much that it made me mad
Livin' off of coke and brew
So much time to sit and lose

You say you want a reason
I offer none to you
The weather of the season
They tell you where to move

That day she walked out the door
Cried so hard on the kitchen floor
Wishin' I could have her back
Feelin' like a heart attack

Told me forever we'd be together
Year later on the telephone
Record deal and a movie role
Tell'n me it's all okay
Wants to meet and speak again
Oh yeah
