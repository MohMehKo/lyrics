Out in the sun
Is where she plays
Just havin fun
Lost in a daze

I'm in love with a candy flippin girl
Oh yeah
Cause I live in a candy flippin world
Oh yeah

She takes her time
Takes all she needs
Feelin alright
Like in a dream

I'm in love with a candy flippin girl
Oh yeah
Cause I live in a candy flippin world
Oh yeah

I wanna go just where she goes
I wanna know just what she knows

I'm in love with a candy flippin girl
Oh yeah
Cause I live in a candy flippin world
Oh yeah
I'm in love with a candy flippin girl
Oh yeah 
Cause I live in a candy flippin world
Oh yeah
