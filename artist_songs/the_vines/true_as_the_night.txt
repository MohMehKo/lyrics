Down & out
Left by the side of the railway
Day goes by into the night
I was thinkin'

And my love is true
And my love is right
And my love is true
True as the night
Oh well

Hear the sound
Over the trees
There's a river
I don't know where to begin
Or to end it

And my love is true
And my love is right
And my love is true
True as the night
Oh well

I stand alone
Inside me
The things ya told
Deny me
Yeah we are the heart
Yeah we are the soul

I stand alone
Inside me
The things ya told
Deny me

Yeah we are the heart
Yeah we are the soul
