Walk the fields and we stare at the ocean
Roll the wheel but forget the notion
Life was better before was smaller
The minds computer will fuck the world up

Feels like a dream
I know you want it
Don't feel supreme
Nobody got it 

World
c'mon fuck the world
c'mon fuck the world
c'mon fuck the world

Walk the fields and we stare at the ocean
Roll the wheel but forget the notion
Life was better before was smaller
The minds computer will fuck the world up

Feels like a dream
I know you want it
Don't feel supreme
Nobody got it 

World
c'mon fuck the world
c'mon fuck the world
c'mon fuck the world

Fuck the world, don't
Fuck the world, don't
Fuck the world, don't
Fuck the world, don't

World
c'mon fuck the world
c'mon fuck the world
c'mon fuck the world

c'mon fuck the world [x5]
