Oh baby gitl
I wanna see you
Night and day
And in my world
I hope nothin'
Will ever change

For you go
I'll be waitin' and waitin' and waitin' and waitin'

Oh baby girl
I wanna ride into the sun
And in my world
Try take a shot
At everyone

For you go
I'll be waitin' and waitin' and waitin' and waitin'

You should know 
I'll be waitin' and waitin' and waitin' and waitin'

Oh baby girl
I love ya
Oh baby girl
