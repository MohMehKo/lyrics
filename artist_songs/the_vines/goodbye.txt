Oh livin now without you
Is cold and grey
Oh how I wanna touch you
And see your face

But now it's over
For you and I
Into the end
Goodbye

Oh wakin in the mornin
I look outside
Memories comin back to haunt me
They make me cry

But now it's over
For you and I
Into the end
Goodbye
Into the end
Goodbye
