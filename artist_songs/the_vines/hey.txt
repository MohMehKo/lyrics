Hey
What are you doin' today?
I had enough of my time
And so I threw it away (All away)

Give me all or give me nothin'
All I want or nothin' more
I'm as bored as she is lonely
Waitin' for no one to call

So
Is there ain't nothin' you know?
I had enough of your smile
So I'm lettin' it all go (All it go)

Give me all or give me nothin'
All I want or nothin' more
I'm as bored as she is lonely
Waitin' for no one to call

Show me the daylight
Oh when I'm there
Tell me it's alright
Oh when I'm there
