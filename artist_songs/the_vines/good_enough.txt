Everything that you have isn’t good enough for you
Where you’ve been, where you stand isn’t good enough for you

Look out of your window, look up at the sky and leave all your sorrow behind

Everything that you have isn’t good enough for you
Where you’ve live, where you stand isn’t good enough for you

There ain’t any reason
There ain’t any rhyme
Forget while you’re sleeping tonight

Everything that I have Isn’t good enough for me
