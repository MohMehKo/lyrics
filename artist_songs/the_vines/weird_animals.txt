I don't wanna live
I don't wanna die
I ain't gotta give
I ain't gonna try
All my spirit gone
Fade into the sun
Whats it gonna take
Till we all became

Weird animals

Walkin down the street
Second time again
Lookin for a sign
Looking for a friend
All my spirit gone
Fade into the sun
Whats it gonna take
Till we all became

Weird animals
Weird animals
