I can hear the ravens
Calli out to me
How the season changes
See it in the trees

In the autumn shade
In the autumn shade

I can sleep tomorrow
I can sleep today
Drownin now in sorrow
I can't get away

In the autumn shade
In the autumn shade

I dream of the summertime
I dream of the world outside

I can hear the ravens
Callin out to me

In the autumn shade
In the autumn shade
In the autumn shade
In the autumn shade
