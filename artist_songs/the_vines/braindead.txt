I want the world around me
For it to be gone
And it to be free

Dead in the brain
Is your claim to fame
I live by the sound

Thinkin' enough about it
The spirit is gone
In what I believe

Dead in the brain
Is your claim to fame
I live by the sound

Out in a dream
When I feel sorrow
Try make believin anyway

Dead in the brain
Is your claim to fame
I live by the sound
And nobody else
