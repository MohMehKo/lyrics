Shes Got Something To Say To Me
About me never comin round
Shes Got Something To Say To Me
And dont know how to be left out

Are you tellin me what you ain't knowin?

Shes Got Something To Say To Me
About me never comin round
Shes Got Something To Say To Me
And dont know how to be left out

Are you tellin me what you ain't knowin?
About me ever coming round to play
And I wouldnt want to let you down

Meet you in the morning after daze
Soaking the sunrays from the ground

Shes Got Something To Say To Me
About me never comin round
Shes Got Something To Say To Me
And dont know how to be left out

Are you tellin me what you ain't knowin?
