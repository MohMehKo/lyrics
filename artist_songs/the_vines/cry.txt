You got me in a state
You got me really down
I wanna get away
But I don't know just how

Waitin for tomorrow
Here in my room
I'm so sad without you
What can I do?
But

Cry cry

I'm feelin really lame
With nothing much to show
Sorrounded by the shame
I've got no place to go

Waitin for tomorrow
Here in my room
I'm so sad without you
What can I do?
But

Cry cry

I just want to be happy
I don't want to be blue

You got me in a state
Cause now I know we're through
I'm feelin so much pain
There's nothing left to do
But

Cry cry cry cry
