I'm a future primitive
I came from the sky
I'm the new definitive
With no reason why

Come n find me come n find me
come n find me
I'm alone
Come n find me come n find me
come n find me
For I go

Yeah hear me shout
Yeah here and now

I don't know what is going on
I don't know where the futures gone

I'm a future primitive
From long long ago
I'm the new definitive
That nobody knows

Come n find me come n find me
come n find me
I'm alone
Come n find me come n find me
come n find me
For I go

I'm a future primitive
