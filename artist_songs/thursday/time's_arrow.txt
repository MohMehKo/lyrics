The rain falls up and off the street
The clocks turn back in retreat
Footsteps fall off of our feet
I see the tears crawling off your cheeks
Turn back to pink
The slap got pulled right off of it
We all fall back into bed again

When you see what you've done
You want to take back
To take it back
You can't, you can't
And it's killing you

Doctor comes off the street
Stitch gets pulled out audibly
Mothers fall down in their seat
I can see time's arrow turning back to me
Children getting light
Disappear into a sign
We'll all rise like snowflakes in the sky tonight
