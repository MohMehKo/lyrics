This is the last time 
That you'll ever hear me say: 
Last call for a better life 
In wedding and cheap champagne. 
Last call for a friday night 
In bathroom stalls and crowded bar. 
Last call. Right before your eyes, 
We celebrate our separate lives. 
Last Call. Where are you friends? 
They're speaking secrets in a silent shout: 
Everything we build, it falls apart, 
And the architect abandons us. 

Last call, when i held you tight, 
The dj played cuts from The Knife. 
Last call, where we used to meet, 
Now we look away and we skip a beat. 
Circular Breathing will separate these feelings 
with heart attack efficiency, 
Erase the figure as it falls. 

(Support collapses at the center of this opposition. 
This infrastructure calls for circular resuscitation) 

The wedding starts 
The guests appear 
The church bells ringing endlessly 
Bride and groom are hand in hand 
And everything goes as it's planned: 
The parents smile, 
The priest chokes up, 
The organ plays "Amazing Grace" 
And underneath the thin white veil 
You can hear them say: 
"Last call for the matching hearts 
Last call for the yellow birds 
Last call for the two of us" 
And the people sing 
La la la la, la la la
