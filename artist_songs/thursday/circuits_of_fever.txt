You are my blanked out pages 
All the wasted spaces 
The old weapons vanished 
Spit blood at dawn, closed forever 

You're an ivory icon 
Held in glass, captive 
You're a falling column 
Sharp little teeth kiss goodnight 

He was upside down and drifting in an 
Endless ocean of night 
The terror came in waves, each one 
Pushing him further from the shore 

You are a fractured mirror 
Silver paper in the wind 
A desperate measure 
Sharp little circuits of fever 

I can feel the unslept hours 
See all the traces 
I can hear the ticking of clocks 
Old record running down 
You can't replace it 
You get distracted by the sound 

He hears an ocean in the dial tone 
Every night, after the sleeping pill goes down 
He wants to believe that he doesn't exist 
He's everywhere and he's nowhere all at once 

We'll fill the blanked out page 
We'll burn the traces 
We'll turn the unslept hours to days 
Old record running down 
We'll flip it over and sing the songs 
We've never heard.
