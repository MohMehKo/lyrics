Don't even take a breath 
The air is cut with cyanide 
In honor of the New Year

The press gives us cause to celebrate 
The air raid sirens 
Flood barbed wire skylines 
With artificial night, 
As we sleep to burn the red 
From our bloodless eyes. 
Tonight we're all time bombs on fault lines

Have we lost everything now? 
Walking like each other's ghosts 
Around these silent streets 
The sedatives tell you everything is alright

Like calendars dying 
At New Year's Eve parties 
As we kiss hard on the lips 
And swear this year 
Will be better then the last 
Jet Black - the ink that spells your name 
Jet Black - The blood that's in your veins 
Jet Black 
We say, "How long can we take this chance not to celebrate?"

There's music playing 
Though we dance to the beat 
Of our own black hearts 
And draw diagrams 
Of suicide on each other's wrists 
Then trace them with razorblades

Fire to flames 
"Strike Match." 

Burn these words from our lips 
As 'The Dagger' screams 
"Love is dead" 
and it's a "newspaper tragedy,"

Have we lost what we love? 
Have we said everything? 

Does it change anything? 
Stare at the clock 
Avoid at all costs, 
This emptiness.

Have we lost everything now? 
Walking like each other's ghosts 
Around these silent streets 
the sedatives tell you everything is alright

Like calendars dying 
at New Year's Eve parties 
As we kiss hard on the lips 
and swear this year 
will be better then the last 

Have we lost everything now? 
Walking like each other's ghosts 
Around these silent streets 
The sedatives tell you everything is alright

Like calendars dying 
at New Year's Eve parties 
So we kiss hard on the lips 
and we swear that this yearâ€¦ this year 

Ten seconds left until midnight 
nine chances to drown ourselves in black hair dye
eight faces turned away from the shock 
seven windows and
six of them were locked 
five stories falling 
forever and ever 
three cheers to the mirror 
now there are two of us 
can we have one last dance?

Jet Black - the ink that spells your name 
Jet Black - The blood that's in your veins 
Jet Black 
We say, "How long can we take this chance not to celebrate?"
