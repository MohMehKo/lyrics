If we run far away do you think we will ever die? 
We'll throw these books in the fire 
Can you stop the train 
Cause it some delay? 
The change machine lied 
And it's too late to scream 

How long is the night? 
It's never over 
The ribbon was tied 
But the card was never read 
The ribbon was crimson 
The color of the night 

Can you see the handwriting on the walls 
And on the autumn leaves that fall 
"What are we gonna do?" 
The trees are giving up on us 
The needle and the thread 
Won't stitch us to the branch 
And the night never ends 

I will never sleep again 
(I will never even close my eyes) 

If the sun is on its way 
Then we will never die 
And we'll follow these tracks to the sight 
Now the lungs collapse 
And the air is getting thin 
All breath expired 
Is too late to heal? 

How long is the night? 

It's all I ever see anymore 
But the day was so bright in the pictures 
In the photo album that you gave me 
It's all I have to live for 

I'm falling down 
And you're not here to break my fall 
I shut my eyes when you're around 
I hold my breath to kill the sound of your voice 
I'm falling down. 
And you're not here to break my fall
