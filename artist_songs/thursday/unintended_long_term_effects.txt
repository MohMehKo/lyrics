A paper crane, in a dirty drain, trying to dry her wings. 
The atom split between her lips in the final stage. 
The chemicals dissolve and the family disappears. 
She sees her life slip between the cracks in the atomic age 
Like a shot in the vein. 

Can a pilot see the the distant arc of history? 
A thousand suns all burst at once in a blinding rage. 
We need a drug, we need something to takw the dreams away 
Because the dream of peace has gone to sleep in the passing lane 
Like a shot in the vein. 

Theres a black dog hanging by a string 
In the flutter of a thousand paper wings. 
You put your faith in the chemicals 
But you fear the crash and you over react 
and you hear the bomb going off 
Then you see the flash and it's all out of synch. 
When you take bitter pills 
No sugar coat can mask the taste. 

A thousand paper cranes 
Left out in the rain.
