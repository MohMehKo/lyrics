There's a purple heart on the stars and stripes tonight
It's pinned to the chest of the latest liar
And if you try to speak your mind
They tell you keep it to yourself
You’ve got friends in the armed forces
They want to  know which side you're on
Doesn't matter cause we’re all being used

To train, to fight
Disregard all human rights
To play the part
The conscience of the damned
You say you're defending me
I'm sick of tying yellow ribbons
Praying not to see

Another folded flag to a mourning mother
He was an army of one but they'll find another
And in the fold of the body bag
She’ll find a check for a hundred grand
She’s got friends in the armed forces
Now we know what a soldier costs
What’s the cost of the rest of us

To take a life
We all have our price
The wife and kids sleep soundly in their beds
You say you're defending me
I'm out tying yellow ribbons
On every single tree

I’ve seen them float like butterflies back home
I can feel the desert's heat
When you're standing next to me
Our friendship offers no relief
Stay with me now, just hear me out
Don't want to lose you to that great black cloud
Coming down
You’ve seen in the path a bullet makes
When it calls you by your name
And the medic can't play the rhythm of your heart
So it starts to fade like footsteps in the march as the parade passes by.


The ticker-tape will rise like sparks when we’re born
To change our minds
Everything that's wrong looks right
The lives we lead
Are somewhere in between


March: Left, Right, Left
You say you're defending me
I'm sick of tying yellow ribbons
Praying not to see
Now sing it
We’re not going to hell
To run rings around a wishing well
