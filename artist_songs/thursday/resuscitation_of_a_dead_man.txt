Ambulance, let me in 
Don't make me stay here 
Ambulance, hold your breath 
We're running short on air 
Ambulance, resuscitate 

At the edge 
You see clearly 
I was dead 
Now I'm back to life 
And love is a fragile thing 
We all stand on a bridge 
That's been slowly burning down 

Ambulance, take me back 
To the house I was born in 
Ambulance, finish it 
Don't wake me up again 
Ambulance, resuscitate 

At the edge 
You see clearly 
I was dead 
Now I'm back to life 
And love is a fragile thing 
We all stand on a bridge 
That's been slowly burning 

Breathe in, breathe out 
Resuscitate 
We can't go on hearing this 
Are we clear 
Send a car, take him back 
Clear 
Just one more time 
Breathe in, breathe in 
While there's still time 

We could be the heartbeat 
Of everything nine tenths collapsed 
Come back to life 
We could be the breath of air 
Just get to the lungs of the dying 
Can you feel a pulse 
It's been stopped for so long 
Can you start it 
Can you feel a pulse 
It's been stopped for so long 
Let's restart it 
With a gentle hand 
With a thousand voices 
With a single word 

When alone 
You see clearly 
I would know 
Now I want to live and love 
All these fragile things 
We all stand on a bridge 
That's been slowly burning down
