Falling from the top floor your lungs 
fill like parachutes
windows go rushing by. 
people inside, 
dressed for the funeral in black and white. 
These ties strangle our necks, hanging in the closet, 
found in the cubicle; 
without a name, just numbers, on the resume stored in the mainframe, marked for delete. 

please take these hands 
throw them in the river, 
wash away the things they never held 
please take these hands, 
throw me in the river, 
dont let me drown before the workday ends. 

9 to 5! 9 to 5!

and we're up to our necks, 
drowning in the seconds, 
ingesting the morning commute
lost in a dead subway sleep
Now we lie wide awake in our parents beds,
tossing and turning. 
tomorrow we'll get up 
drive to work, 
single file 
with everyday 
it's like the last. 
waiting for the life to start, is it always just always ahead of the curve? 

please take these hands 
throw them in the river, 
wash away the things they never held 
please take these hands, 
throw me in the river, 
dont let me drown before the workday ends. 

just keep making copies 
of copies 
of copies 
when will it end? 

it'll never end, 
'til it gets so bad 
that the ink fills in our fingerprints 
and the silouhette of your own face becomes the black cloud of war 
and even in our dreams we're so afraid the weight will offset who we are 
all those breaths that you took have now been canceled in your lungs. 
last night my teeth fell out like ivory typewriter keys
and all the monuments and skyscrapers burned down and filled the sea.

save our ship 
the anchor is part of the desk 
we can't cut free, 
the water is flooding the decks 
the memo's sent through the currents
computers spark like flares 
i can see them. 
they don't touch me, 
touch me. 

please someone, 
teach me how to swim. 
please, don't let me drown, 
please, don't let me drown.
