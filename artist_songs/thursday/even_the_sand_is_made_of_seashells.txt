I hear the ocean breathing in a sigh.
The seagulls screaming overhead, just out of site.
I see the sun melt slowly in your eyes.
Fall into the dirty water, time after time.

Every single song was once alive, just like the two of us.
We went down to the water's edge.
And now there's nothing but grains of sand.

The signal flashes family from the shore.
Echoes in the distance with, the sound of your voice.
Nothing has ever seemed so far away.
Wave after wave, it's calling me.
Wave after wave after wave...

Every single song was once alive, just like the two of us.
We step into the shallow end to see what love was like.
At the waters edge our lives were shut.
The tide keeps rolling out.
But now we're nothing.
Now you're nothing but grains of sand.

Lalalala...

We left a pain that feels like the end is coming.
Breaking the steps and we say that our lives were always.
Nothing but grains of sand.
