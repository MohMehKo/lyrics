You can't undo the needle's damage
You can't unwalk a line once it's been crossed
This is why we sing such common songs
We live in a common age
Filled with the common rage

Call out, collapsing, the shadows all fall
Send out receivers to shut it off
I never feel a thing
You won't feel a thing
I never feel a thing
I feel it getting away from me now
This is common existence
This is common existence

The best laid plans turn into tragedies
The best of friends make for the worst enemies
This is why we lead such common lives
We live in the common days
Held to all the common ways

Call out, collapsing, the shadows all fall
Send out receivers to shut it off
I never feel a thing
You won't feel a thing
I never feel a thing

This is common existence
Everywhere you look, another fire is going dark
Another face is busted apart
No more existing
This is common existence
Like a paper scrap blowing down the street
It used to have meaning
Now it's incomplete
And the important parts get lost in the ink on the page
This is common existence
Everyone you know has been trying on the damage
Blowing out the candles
Thinking of a common escape from common existence

Call out, collapsing, the shadows all fall
Send out receivers to shut it off
I never feel a thing
You won't feel a thing
I never feel a thing
I feel it getting away from me now
This is common existence
This is common existence

Don't move, don't move, don't move
