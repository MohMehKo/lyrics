Dear friends, we're gathered here
To wish it all away in a field of flowers
Say vows and count our blessings
Too much time selecting
All the words to frame the possibilities
It's all we'll ever have
All we'll ever be

The worst vow is a broken vow
So don't say it now
Wouldn't mean it anyway
These words have the bitter taste of honesty
It's not the same
On our own
It's not the same
No, no, no

Dear friends, make your peace
We'll dissolve into a movie screen
Speak now or forever hold your secrets in
Too much time selecting
All the words to frame the possibilities
It's all we've ever had
All we'll ever be

The worst vow is a broken vow
So don't say it now
Wouldn't mean it anyway
These words have the bitter taste of honesty
It's not the same
Oh, no, no
It's not the same
Oh, no, no

Tonight the band plays on as you walk away
Forget to save me
A waltz, a dance
A last piece of you and me
A wedding cake
I'll always be a broken piece
You'll always be a broken piece

The worst vow is this broken vow
So don't say it now
Won't mean it anyway
These words have a bitter taste
And honestly, it's not your way
