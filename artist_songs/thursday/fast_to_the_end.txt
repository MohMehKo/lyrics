Maintain the bearing that you left with
Fifteen degrees north of anywhere
Try not to feel the shake in you hands
Just close your eyes and go fast to end

Breathe in the white clouds
And wait
Freeze out the world with
Ice crystals on the windscreen
And you're in the pilots chair

Mayday, ground control to no one
Empty the seats and put away the maps
You've been away past the far horizons

Close your eyes and sleep
Fast to the end

Breathe in the white clouds
And wait
Freeze out the world with
Ice crystals on the windscreen
And you're in the pilots chair

Faster, faster, faster, faster...
Faster, faster, faster...

Breathe in the white clouds
And wait
Freeze out the world with
Ice crystals on the windscreen
And you're in the pilots chair

Faster, faster, faster, faster...
