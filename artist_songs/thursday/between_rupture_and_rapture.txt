in the veins of the ultraviolet light,
the phosphor is starting a fire
shooting up in the iodine;
its turning on

rupture the wall around my heart
i feel so lost,
i've been shaking. you can't save me 
(forget what the doctor said)
every bird in mid-flight is calling out your name
before it hits the window and it sings the rapture

without a second opinion
the chemicals saturate
to counteract the code
through the double-helix we are twisting
(too scared to let this go)
someone call the head nurse
she's coming to the capitol
to wrap us up and throw us in the dirt, with a dream thats turning off

rupture the wall around my heart
i feel so lost,
i've been shaking. you can't save me 
(forget what the doctor said)
every bird in mid-flight is calling out your name
before it hits the window and it sings the rapture

we're coming to the capitol [x2]
the distance between us will rupture
coming to the capitol
in our hearts the disease wont touch us
coming to the capitol

love, now its too late 
(love) to turn this off
alone is all we are
even when we we feel this close
it's just a lie we believe

these are the words that escape from our lungs,
rupture the wall ive built around my heart
i've been shaking 
you can't save me
im turning off
we can't find a way
out of this moment
were lost in a dark hallway
