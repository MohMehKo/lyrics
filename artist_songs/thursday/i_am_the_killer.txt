Tuesday wakes up silent 
And there aren't enough pills to sleep 
And then it cuts out like miswired shortwave radio 
It's over 
But nothing can change to ever make it right 
When you live in a nightmare 
It's written all over your face. 

And in a short time 
You're never the same again 
The distance is streamlined 
Between decision and defense: 

Distorient the senses 
Loss of identity 
No one to trust 

Life runs through this trade 
I am no killer 
But I still hide my face 
In the coming days 

I wake up every morning 
From the same dream 
And then I kill it 
But you can't change the letters when the ink dries 

I woke up on the sidewalk and everything just changed 
Now the lights are blinking but I can't see anything 

Everything is falling apart: 
Crumpled paper 
Crushed tin cans 
Broken bottles 
Paper scraps 
We all look the same 
We all look the same 
But I am the killer
