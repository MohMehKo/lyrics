We walk alone
Till the end of night
It's suicide
But we will overcome

Another life
Swinging in the breeze
These southern trees
Have the strangest fruit

Follow the path that's straight and narrow, hand in hand
Our roads are paved with broken arrows
We will overcome
We will overcome

Our fathers plant arms in foreign soil
Our brothers die
And no one knows
Where it ends (between the crosshairs)
All lies weave a thousand deaths around us

Follow the path that's straight and narrow, hand in hand
Our roads are paved with broken arrows
We will overcome
We will overcome

Follow the path that's straight and narrow, hand in hand
Our roads are paved with broken arrows
We will overcome
We will overcome
We will overcome
If no one sleeps tonight
We will overcome
We will overcome
If no one sleeps tonight

We will wait for this
We waited too long
To see the Promised land

We can't wait no more
We will stand up at the Promised land
We will overcome (We will overcome)
Overcome
