They sold the old house 
Boarded up the rooms just the way you wanted 
They sold your possessions 
Gave them all away with the guns 
You sing like the wind in the trees at night 
You think I'm asleep but I'm awake for it 
You think you can hide so easily 
That noone ever hears you 

And I say love has led us astray 
Love won't let us sleep 

First we're cut from the cloth in perfect shapes 
Then we're tied in a knot and we're left to fray 
Can you even see what you're doin to me 
You sleep in the leaves and I can't wake you up 
You float like a reed in the river bank 
If I dive too deep I can't hear you 
But everyone else does 

And love has led us astray 
Love won't let us sleep 
And love has led us astray 
Love won't let us sleep 

And love has led us astray 
Love won't let us sleep 
And love has led us astray 
Love won't let us sleep 

Astray, astray, astray 
Astray, astray, astray 
First we're cut from the cloth in perfect shapes 
Then we're tied in a knot and we're left to fray 
Love has led us astray
