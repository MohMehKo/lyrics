You cut your teeth on the cold war costumes
But caught your eye on a Lilly-white lullaby of
red and black collapse
You mix it up in the church and state dives
But cut it loose when it's time, it's time, it's time to let it go

Check your flag to see which way it blows
No...
Lick your finger then you'll really know
You got a taste for the candy contracts and that's why
You kiss your wife with a Saccharin sweet smile
It's red and white polite
To keep your cool in the hot seat spotlight
You turn it up: the heat
The heat is getting close

Check your flag to see which way it blows
No...
Lick your finger then you'll really know
But you won't find out
Which way the wind really blows
Until your hand gets caught in the cookie jar
