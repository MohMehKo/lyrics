Just ahead I see you winding up 
And you're dressing this color on the edge of fire 
Until these tightened strides 
They march in time again 
I don't know if I will cut through 

I don't know if my heart will beat without you guiding it 

Winding up 
Leading me 
Winding up to explode 

It's the sound of your racing heart 
That beats in time with every start 
(the start of the year. the start of life. the start of war) 
That reaches up and across the sky 
That makes us want to try 

I'm falling to peices 
I can't let go 
Tearing apart your lies 
I want to live 

It's the sound of your shotgun pulse 
Beating over and over in your silent halls 
It's a thought that keeps us alive 
It makes us want to rise 

A scream to guide me through my life 
Winding up 
Leading me 
Winding up to what you can not unwind 

This side of you and if it's taken away 
You won't know what to do 
You're stretching to meet expectations that you will never reach 

And now it's far to late to ever leave this cold 

I'm giving up 
Marching in time with your drums 
I'm letting go of everything i once loved
