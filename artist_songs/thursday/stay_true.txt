Kid, you need some thicker skin,
You don't take punches well.
You're just like your old man
But you're young and scared.
You're weak in your beliefs
And you've got so much to prove
And not a lot of time
Before they get to you.

So please, Stay True.

Yeah, you stick up for your friends
And you've got a lot of heart.
You remind me of myself
Before I lost my nerve.

I've been counting my mistakes.
I can see all that we've lost
And I don't want to talk
About the old days.

Disregard those clapping hands.
They'll turn to punches when you're down.
Disregard the critics' praise.
They'll be the first to tell the news
That you've sold your soul.
Disregard those dollar signs.
They'll buy the biggest house in hell
Where you'll live alone.
Just keep your head down,
Keep your friends close,
Hold fast to your beliefs
And, whatever else you do,
Stay True.
Believe me, when I say,
It's the hardest thing to do.
Stay True.
They'll kill you by inches.
Don't let them make a move.
Stay True.
Look me in the eye
And promise me one thing:
Stay True.
Nothing else matters.
None of this is real.

Disregard the cynics' path.
They'll buy a drink and laugh with you
While you trade defeats.
Disregard your fear of death.
We've all got a lot to lose.
Whatever else you do,
Stay True.
