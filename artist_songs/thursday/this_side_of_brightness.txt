I sewed it up Stitched all these dead end streets
Into the sewn up seams of my heartstrings unwind(unwound)
Like a petal pulled from an open flower.
Surrounds by fields where children sign but don't make a sound and don't

Break it off
This searching for what we may never find
And that says it all.
I hope that we will make it through..

The heartbreak that comes with just living through one day
All the good times that past and all the friends we lose in a lifetime on our way.

Here in this life we seem so lost.
On this side of brightness we don't know where to go.

I hope that we can make it
Through this night.
