Splintered piece of glass falls, in the seat, gets caught 
These broken windows, open locks, reminders of the youth we lost 
In trying so hard to look away from you 
we followed white lines to the sunset 
I crash my car everyday the same way 

Time to let this pass 
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go) 
Time runs through our veins. 
(it starts and stops and starts and stops again) 
We don't stand a chance in this threadbare time 
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)
Time to let this pass 
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)

Staring at the setting sun 
No reason to come back again 
The twilight world in blue and white 
The needle and the damage done 

I don't want to feel this way forever 
A dead letter marked return to sender 

The broken watch you gave me turns into a compass 
It's two hands still point to the same time 12:03, our last goodbye 

So push the seats back a little further
I can see the headlights coming 
So push the seats back a little further
Roll the windows down and take a breath
I can see the headlights coming
They paint the world in red and broken glass

Time to let this pass 
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go) 
Time runs through our veins. 
(it starts and stops and starts and stops again) 
We don't stand a chance in this threadbare time 
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)
Time to let this pass 
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)

Staring at the setting sun 
No reason to come back again 
The twilight world in blue and white 
The needle and the damage done 

I don't want to feel this way forever 
A dead letter marked return to sender 

The spinning hubcaps set the tempo, for the music of the broken window 
The Cameras on and the cameras click 
We open up the lens and can't stop

Staring at the setting sun 
No reason to come back again 
The twilight world in blue and white 
The needle and the damage done

I don't want to feel this way forever 

The lights are on and the cameras click
We open up the lens (to broken glass!)

Staring at the setting sun (And it's over!)
No reason to come back again (In a flash!)
The twilight world in blue and white (and I'll never!)
The needle and the damage done (ever understand!)

I don't want to feel this way forever (Understanding!)
(In a Car Crash!) A dead letter marked return to sender (In a Car Crash!)
(In a Crash!) In a Crash!
