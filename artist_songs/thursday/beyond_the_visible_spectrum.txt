When I first saw you 
there were guns in the river 
Black birds of warning 
Circling high above the marquee where 
The blue notes of lovers 
Mixed with the loneliness of others 
Turned our breath into snowflakes 
As we whispered in the gutters 

We try to find the life at rainbow's end 
It finds the end of us instead and everyone we love 

When I come back now, 
There are ads in the shadows 
Diamonds in the skyline 
You can't afford to look up at them 
Or catch your reflection in somone else's mirror 
Your voice is a music and I'm drowning in a silent land. 

So if I dive over the railing, will I float up on all the shining waves of glass?
