Watched him walk away (watched him walk away) 
Climb the endless shadow side 
Watched him holding on 
(watched him holding on) (watched him walk away) 

It was a thousand years, a thousand miles, a thousand dreams, a thousand minutes 
With no goodbye 
Disappear from me (a thousand miles, a thousand dreams, a thousand minutes) 
Hold on! 
As he climbed the highest peak of the dark mountain 

Let the mountain sleep 
In the past with all our bad dreams 

Was it a metaphor for all the subtle ways we would grow apart? 
Was it mortality? 

Climbing and plunged right off of the edge of his life! 
Into the hands of a loving God, oh reaching forward to get torn apart 
With his hands in the air, was he laughing and dancing or only just trying to wave 'Goodbye'! 

Say a prayer for me (Hold on!) 
As he climbed the highest peak of the dark mountain 
Let the mountain fall 
Struck me down until I can't go on 

Let go! Let me fall down! onto! the ground 

Don't leave 
Go on alone 

It felt like a thousand years 
It was a thousand miles away 
It was a thousand miles away
