We were safe, now we're paralyzed
Suspended in flight
At this speed it makes no difference 
Where I start and where you end
Or if you sit in an emergency aisle

We could be dead, complete the equation
Our names are X and N
We have no value in these calculations

We're placed on a plane pointed straight down
Traveling at five hundred feet per second
Five thousand feet from the ground

How long will it take us to hit?
How fast till we start the disintegration?

No time left - just keep moving
No time left - just keep moving

How long will it take us to hit?
How fast till we start the disintegration?

We could be safe here, forever
Falling in the clean blue air
Somewhere between the sun that gives us light
And the ground that puts it out

We'll kneel in the aisle,
Press our hands together
Close our eyes and speak these words 
So softly to the black box
And it goes:

"Mother, father can you hear this? 
I want to thank you for all the sweetness but
I'm not coming home, we're never coming home."
