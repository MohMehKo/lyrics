A darker forest paints with blood in the sun sliding down its trees
And casts in relief the colors we have seen
And all the storms that we had been
They're paled and past
In the presence of the world at hand

Am I really there in the fractured light of the forest floor
With the broken branches
Am I really there in the same light
In the same life on the only road

A darker forest waits 
In which we relive all our past mistakes
And trace them back with our decisions
To the fork in the road
But what if every path you take
Starts to look the same
And lead equally astray
We'll walk in circles and never find our way
