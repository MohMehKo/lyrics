I'm the cat with the bass and drum
Going 'round like bom, bom, bom

I'm the cat with the bass and drum
Going 'round like bom, bom, bom
What's grooving? I'm moving
I like your style of womping
How charming! Just a rapper
Load him up and eat that snapper
I want 16 pints of rum and then I go bom, bom
Glowing up in the dark of the night
And so I go ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah, I
I've brought a pie in my pocket
Pie in my pocket, an eye in my socket
No got life, no got style
No got nothing on my mind
But I'm so cool and I'm so groovy
When I go bom, bom, bom

You 'round like bom, bom, bom

I'm so cool and I'm so groovy
When I go bom, bom, bom

I'm the cat with the bass and drum
Going 'round like bom, bom, bom
What's grooving? I'm moving
I like your style of womping
How charming! Just a rapper
Load him up and eat that snapper
I want 16 pints of rrrrum and then I go bom, bom
Glowing up in the dark of the night
And so I go ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah, I
I've brought a pie in my pocket
Pie in my pocket, an eye in my socket
No got life, no got style
No got nothing on my mind
But I'm so cool and I'm so groovy
When I go bom, bom, bom

I'm so cool and I'm so groovy
When I go bom, bom, bom

Bom, bom, bom

I'm so cool and I'm so groovy
When I go bom, bom, bom
