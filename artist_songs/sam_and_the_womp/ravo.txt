You know it's time for some action
Which means dancing all night long!
So slip your shoes on, get a move on
Gonna wiggle that booty tonight
Feel how the beat takes control of your feet
We will dance the night away
Salty sweat pearls
When you ravo, ravo with me

Faster, faster!
Rollercoaster!
Shockwave thunder!
Faster, faster!
This is the rollercoaster

How the floor is on fire, baby
Roast it with your feet
Lightning strikes
And the rhythm shakes your bones!
How my heart is electric
Sending waves across the room
Salty sweat pearls
When you ravo, ravo with me

Faster, faster!
Rollercoaster!
Shockwave thunder!
Faster, faster!
This is the rollercoaster

You know it's time for some action
Which means dancing all night long!
So slip your shoes on, get a move on
Gonna wiggle that booty tonight
Feel how the beat takes control of your feet
We will dance the night away
Salty sweat pearls
When you ravo, ravo with me

Faster, faster!
Rollercoaster!
Shockwave thunder!
Faster, faster!
This is the rollercoaster
