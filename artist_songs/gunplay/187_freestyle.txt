Free my nigga Kano
Tonight's the night I get in some shit
Bart simpson shit, I wanna see that crimson shit
Down city clippers, clip some shit
Miami flippers, flip some shit
Wet your car get neck dumar
Don't beg the arts, the arms in my palm
By the lenght of arms
Scrant the number as long as I'm nr 1
On me don't slumber none
Nothing but guns, yea nothing but sons
Nothing but cunts, nothing but lunch
Sick in the towel shit that will stick it to the tip of the tower
Dick sucking bitch don't put your lips on the bottle
She had the hard knock life 'cause she trickin' the body
Got whooped a couple of times
She ain't tripping nobody
Er'time I hit she say my dick is atomic
Waddup you know I'm a cut up
It's no thing, came for one got fronted a hundred more things
Take one shot no honey cocaine, give me money no fame
You need new shoes, how you running game
They cut a nigga lose, 'cause I ain't wanna tame,
Fuck nigga call for, now I'm a wanted man
Tryin' to make a milly I'm a hundred dollar now
How the hell I get deal and credible
You don't hear? you finna feel
This trigga' here nigga yeah
I'm climbing up a sugar hill look at here, look at here
Bogata medellin? 7 gears
You playin' with me
You know the rest
You playin' with me
You know the rest
You playin' with me
You know the rest
You playin' with me
You know the rest
Borgata medellin nigga
Shank amir, salute
