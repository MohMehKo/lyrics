[Hook: Gunplay]
Don't feed the apes [x4]
We got banana clips
Don't feed the apes [x4]
We got banana clips
I'm going zoo, every time I'm going through [x4]

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
I'm going dummy, I'm going zoo
I'm going rahhhhh
Now, who is who, you can get the ruger too
Ruger straight 151 and the [?]
You Built the [?], break it down and build the [?]
Shoes don't turn, shits tilts the curb
My shirt was silky when the court read the guilty word
Such a filthy word, back to trying milky word
I'm on my get cake, pie ass nigga
I'm on my big steak, pie ass nigga
All our bitches fish flight, pie ass nigga
All I do is check chase, plane train bicycle

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
AK with that long dick, get yo' fuckin' bone pick
I get on my 'Bron lick, your head get flicked like a coin flip
I come through with them twin Glocks
And kill you and the nigga you was born with'
Bitch I'm still the best rapper, I got bars like phone strength
I get my weed from so and so, I get my guns from such and such
And all my homies got that weight, all them niggas muscle punks
Fuck y'all niggas I'm way too strong, gettin' to the bread like Grey Poupon
Open this gun up like a book, damn Lil Tune, what page you on?
Early bird gets the worm, early dog gets the bird
High as fuck, vision blurred, unisex bullets, his or hers
You pussy cat, you hiss, you purr
Me, I go ape shit, on my skate shit, nigga TrukFit!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
I'm going ape shit
Spend a Benz on they shift
I'm short stopping shit on they shift
On they turf, footprints on they dirt
Taking all they money, I know they hurt
Champagne, Steak pot
Tattooed the shirt under my tank top
My lane lock, my chain rock
Won't move a muscle, baby set the bank vault
Bitch I whip gang, Bitch I get bands
You trying to break me bitch, slim chance
My speaker beating, my shoes kick ass
Down the beating and game over for you Riff-Raffs
