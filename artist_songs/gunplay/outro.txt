I could live anywhere I want to, you know why I live in this neighbourhood? Availabilty.
I wanna stay close to everything cuz being on the spot I could see trouble immediately.
Trouble is like a cancer, you gotta get it early.
You don't get it early it gets to big and then it kills you.
That's why you gotta cut it off, capish? Eh? Nobody cares, nobody cares.
Worry about yourself, your family, the people that are important.
