[Hook:]
My definition of a plug, nigga (this the definition)
My definition of a plug, nigga (get money, alright)
My definition of a plug, nigga (drug life)
My definition of a plug, nigga (drug life)

[Verse 1:]
Come getcha what you want
Maybe front you one
If you cool, front you two
Let you do what you do
Ain't no drugs without a plug
That's like a plate without the grub
Like a hood without the fuzz
Like a nose without the snub
Nothin' snappin', nothin' poppin'
No connect, there ain't no profit
Damn dog, I whipped it hard
Can't go back and soften it
It's a drought, nothin' 'round
Not a pound, lookin' awful
Not a brick, not a nick
Clack, click, it's time for office
Now my fool just threw me four
Got some good news for my folk
Took that trip, hit that road
Dirty, far from fifty-four
I'm a hustler
Definition of a thug nigga
Drug life
And this my definition of a plug, nigga...

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
My definition of a plug is a Mexican
Put the work in the gas tank, and ship it in
Plugs, nigga, there's different type of plugs
'Cause I'm a plug myself
Ten brick minimum, I was really dealin' em
Plug gold chains, gold watches
I'm a dope boy, I am
I get that second, pass it off to Old Boy
Definition of a bitch is a rat, nigga
So never, ever, ever do that, nigga
House smellin' like yayo
Taste that residue
Got a million out the streets
Who'd of ever knew?
I'm talkin' UPS
The way it travel mint
I'm talkin' Fed Ex
To keep it 'round me

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
The fuckin' definition, pussy nigga, I got pigeons
In the kitchen lookin' like I scaled 1000 fishes
Junkies itching, bitchin'
Ain't seen a decent rock in months
Now they back to rollin' reefer
Picture crackheads crackin' blunts
This the dope game, baby
Got a whole thing with me
Dope dollars
No bloodstains came with it
Time's money
Whip a eighth in eight minutes
The white team winnin'
Won a game in eight innings
They know I throw narcota
So they knock on my door harder
Got a starter kit
'Bout to start another Carter
I'm a hustler
Definition of a thug nigga
Drug life
And this my definition of a plug, nigga...

What's your definition, fool?
