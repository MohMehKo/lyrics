Leave as it is
When you share air with dealers
And feed the savages
Savages, savages, savages, savages

Leave as it is
When you share air with dealers
And feed the savages
Savages, savages, savages, savages

Savages, automatic
Now that's damage
At the end of broken antenna
Caught me faggin' with no bandanas
And I still pull up to the corner store
With a peeled top
Baseheads still ask me if I still cop
Big gun with a little dot
Never been to Arkansas,
But I got a Little Rock
I'll pull an oak
And slap you with the steel park
Ain't no one poppin'
If I ain't poppin'
Left the words and then drop it
You got guns but they ain't choppers
You got wounds but they ain't got it

Leave as it is
When you share air with dealers
And feed the savages
Savages, savages, savages, savages

Leave as it is
When you share air with dealers
And feed the savages
Savages, savages, savages, savages

And my mind is a plan to extend and get adequate
'Til then I'm still enlightened
I'm a rap it
Now I get confused
Niggaz are sick
I'm in a different zone, presidential suits nigga
Their legs get weak
When it's time to stand up

Leave as it is
When you share air with dealers
And feed the savages
Savages, savages, savages, savages

Leave as it is
When you share air with dealers
And feed the savages
Savages, savages, savages, savages

I look up the definition savage
It means cruel
Regress at the primal state
Savages, savages
