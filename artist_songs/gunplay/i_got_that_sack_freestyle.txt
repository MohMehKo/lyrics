Fresh off in that pan
Rozay threw me that alley watch the backboard shatter
This some jack boy chatter
This a thief's theme, intervene with automatics
Knock a lame right off the ladder and laugh at 'em
Police knowing that I'm ducking
Bitch you knowing that I'm bucking
These pussy niggas mad
Time to flow 'em out their covers taking all they bitches
Fucking all their mothers, just a rolex and my rubbers
Rich angry military issue banger
Nigga be rapping tough in them cuffs niggas be singing
Niggas be grain, niggas be pot, niggas be pussy, nigga not I
Nigga not never, nigga not then
Nigga not now, nigga na-ah
Hell you yelling, begging out loud for a nigga to leave you alive
Nigga that ain't what's happenin' no re-run no raj
No boofle no flaj
I'm up against no odds googoo beans and jewelry up against my heart
I piss fish flounder, I get it from the founder
Dirty money under that table, I spend it over that counter
Ain't no hussle that I don't know
I'm eating now I'm chowing up
Bogota, Medellin
Turn it up it ain't loud enough
I'm throwing rocks at the chain game [x8]
Come on, told you
