[Hook: Gunplay (Rick Ross)]
Take what you want, tie they ass up
Just don't, get, no, blood on the dope
Just don't, get, no, blood on the dope
Bring it back all white (don't get no blood on the dope)
Bring it back all white (don't get no blood on the dope)
Bring it back all white (don't get no blood on the dope)
Bring it back all white (don't get no blood on the dope)

[Bridge: PJK (Gunplay)]
Burden on my head, dawg I need to get some bread
Chopper and a mask, gotta heater bustin heads
(Now its music in their ears, I got a perfect licking mind
Bout to slide by their crib, point it out and put you down)

[Hook: Gunplay (Rick Ross)]
Take what you want, tie they ass up

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
See that crib right there, yeah right there
Two workers, one pitbull, cocaine and a hundred thousand in there
We too breezy in this shit, too easy
It's Christmas time, we all know the season
All I want is cash and coke
Got the tape, rope and brand new O
If they looking like they wanna buck
Hit em up cause no getting blood on the dope and rug
And we Gucci, and we came up
If they ask, I don't ever bring my name up
Bout to cop a crib, bout to scoop a biz
Bout to get myself together then go lace my boots again

[Hook: Gunplay (Rick Ross)]
Take what you want, tie they ass up
Just don't, get, no, blood on the dope

Bring it back all white (don't get no blood on the dope)

[Verse 2: PJK]
Mask on, fully loaded, when I pull on street
Rifle, butcher knife, zip ties for hands and feet
As I'm walking toward the door I hear a small commotion
Tried to open, it was locked so I kicked it open
Peeped the scene, daughter screamed
Someone screamed, I slap him
Look his daddy in his eyes and say I'm here to jack ya
Ask who else was in the house, he say its just his wife
Tied him up, layed him down, hit them with the knife
Ask em once he tried to play me, I don't play no games
Kicked his face, broke his nose, took that to his brain
Pussy nigga you done got yo blood all on my kicks
Tell me now before I spill your blood all on your bitch
He said "Chris I knew that's you, I know your whole damn family
Can't we make some deal my dawg, lets get some understanding"
I don't give no fuck about no nigga tryna beg
Give no fuck, yo kids in here, I'm still gon' blow your head

[Hook: Gunplay (Rick Ross)]
Take what you want, tie they ass up
Just don't, get, no, blood on the dope
Just don't, get, no, blood on the dope
Bring it back all white (don't get no blood on the dope)
Bring it back all white (don't get no blood on the dope)
Bring it back all white (don't get no blood on the dope)
Bring it back all white (don't get no blood on the dope)

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Blood on the dope, blood on the floor, blood on your ho
My young nigga a blood, I show em love
Blood on the plug, cause I hit em up
He was flinchin' and shit, told him to get up
Blood on the kush, got a wife and dad
That made the price go up when they hit the town
Blood on the dough, I'm going to war for it
And I got junkies at the door, and I got chickens in the kitchens
I got niggas in the trenches
And you got pussies, so all yo niggas bitches, damn homie
Call it walking on tomatoes, them red bottoms
Call it thug vacation, when the feds got em
Call it what you want it, just can't call me broke boy
And I'm dirty, go out my way to fuck yo ho boy
Its muddy mixed with purple, say it slow boy
And there's blood on everybody when there's war boy

[Hook: Gunplay (Rick Ross)]
Take what you want, tie they ass up
Just don't, get, no, blood on the dope
Just don't, get, no, blood on the dope
Bring it back all white (don't get no blood on the dope)
Bring it back all white (don't get no blood on the dope)
Bring it back all white (don't get no blood on the dope)
Bring it back all white (don't get no blood on the dope)
