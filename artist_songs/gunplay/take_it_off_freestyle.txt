Take it off
Baby take it all off
Running Cee-Lo bout a thousand B Low
I ain't crabbin I'm a head cracking hero
Don't be fucking with my fritos bitch
She drinking generations when she eat on dick
She pee on tricks and tell me they don't trip
My paint ain't stratched yo nigga shit on skip
Microphone check bitches stomping on strips
Running on hope chasing down a wish
She need a daddy that's solid with a fat wallet
She feels safe when I'm pally
Pimping big bills bottles old as tommy's
They love my rhyming but lust my diamonds
You think that slut a goddess? she a couple dollars gutter
I be hard on this hoes slapping bras off these hoes
Can't pay attention better pawn somethin hoe
Drop her to the floor bitch lower something hoe
You gotta pay this, pay that, tell me something I don't know
Go get your take it off, take it off
Now go and make it all
Take it off, take it off
Now go and make it all
Take it off, take it off
Now go and make it all
Take it off, take it off
Now go and make it all
Take it off, take it off
Now go and make it all
Take it off, take it off
Now go and make it all
Take it off, take it off
Now go and make it all
Take it off, take it off
Now go and make it all
Ey man lemme fire this joint aright real quick
Tell these bitches a thing or two
First off bitch, don't be begging
