My dog says we're gonna be rich one day
Lay it down, don't say a sound, gunplay
Word, this for my niggas on the block and hallways, word
Ball every Monday through Sunday

Rolling,
Everytime you see me on the set one, rims whips on them shits boi
Snatch a dime nigga on the rip cause I'm rolling, nigga cause I'm rolling, nigga cause I'm rolling
My vip's drunk tight, all I see this ace of spades
Five percent tints, behind this all black shades
A young nigga paid, number nine jays,
If you run your city like me, rapp where you stay Play that music.

[Gunplay:]
My campaign's in champagne, can't slow down my fast lane
I do my damn thing I'm drunk on that carosine
Got birds I'm the batman, pussy by the caravan
It's fake I ain't wearin it, my cake white as mayonaise
My chop sticks will fold out the drums hold a whole lot
Juss buss me a liq I had to bond my lil woe out
Tore down that pussy, left her walls swole out
The dade county nigga, twist your fro and let it grow out
I pop as they countdown, can't turn down my loud pack
You keep it real in the field home boy, I doubt that
Think you finna bring it here think twice we wild out
You ride make me shout that
If not you ain't bout that

Rolling,
Everytime you see me on the set one, rims whips on them shits boi
Snatch a dime nigga on the rip cause I'm rolling, nigga cause I'm rolling, nigga cause I'm rolling
My vip's drunk tight, all I see this ace of spades
Five percent tints, behind this all black shades
A young nigga paid, number nine jays,
If you run your city like me, rapp where you stay Play that music.

[Waka Flocka:]
I'm drinking ace of spades like a pop soda
Man I'm ballin out rapping, I'm a stock holder
Cleiko love me like Brooklyn love, Hova
For his green Rover, call it Tarzan
Hell yeah I'm sleep walking buggin off them zanz
Hundred grand in my pocket watch me do the money dance
I'm finna change my name to Benjamin Flocka
Lord forgive me for my sins, I just killed a G
Outskirts on the seat, pineapple paint
Bottles on me, what you want to drink?
Pills on me, who want the E?
Skip two letters, I'm a fucking G

Rolling,
Everytime you see me on the set one, rims whips on them shits boi
Snatch a dime nigga on the rip cause I'm rolling, nigga cause I'm rolling, nigga cause I'm rolling
My vip's drunk tight, all I see this ace of spades
Five percent tints, behind this all black shades
A young nigga paid, number nine jays,
If you run your city like me, rapp where you stay Play that music.

[Gunplay:]
Gun on my waist, gun in my lanes, sitting on leather squatin on a santé
Suckers getting santé, forgetting all pray
Buyer and supplier it takes two to rob banks, cause the tape on the town
The money on the carpet, fish scales looking like I peeled it off the topper
White sea to water, this shit getting walking
One question in that room, they kill a bitch for talkin
This song's like a ball man, this song's just for tossing
These chains, these rings, these things, I'm flossin
Ace, is spillin
Bananas, is peelin
A mouth for fun
I need, a million

Rolling,
Everytime you see me on the set one, rims whips on them shits boi
Snatch a dime nigga on the rip cause I'm rolling, nigga cause I'm rolling, nigga cause I'm rolling
My vip's drunk tight, all I see this ace of spades
Five percent tints, behind this all black shades
A young nigga paid, number nine jays,
If you run your city like me, rapp where you stay Play that music.
