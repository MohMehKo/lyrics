Dollar in my pocket, million on my mind
My hustle in the bus so now my gun's my only pride
Top of the food chain
I gotta eat I gotta eat
Top of the food chain
I gotta eat I gotta eat
Food chain
A fish among sharks
Ants among thieves
Put you on the hook, motherfucker now you're meat
Top of the food chain
I gotta eat I gotta eat
Top of the food chain
I gotta eat I gotta eat
Food chain

Top of the food chain, rider
My two chains, bitches
They sweat me like they've been draggin' two days jackets
They roll with Jag rappers
They wanna wack a solo
They only cracked so I held the soda back
Jumpers on the scrap
This a total rap
Heard your heart racin' but couldn't go the lap
Poke in the air, lookin' like I'm hangin' off a branch
Hot boy ice, I'm a lover avalanche
Fuckin' with urangutans that will string the fence
We came in here and won't even leave the stance
Million dollar hunt, you huntin' for some guns
Promise I'll give her back when I'm done that's on the one

Dollar in my pocket, million on my mind
My hustle in the bus so now my gun's my only pride

I gotta eat I gotta eat
Top of the food chain

Food chain

I'm with the gang on you roaches
You're surrounded by vultures
About to lock on the candle
Will cut the leash off the choker
Nobody sit, nobody move
Cause I'm a chase, I taste the blood
Now here come the flood
Open the gates where my 8â€²s at
Credit crush grates at
Came to turn the zoo upside down ASAP
Models make it, bridals break it
The whole town had your bakin'
The prayer you makin'
Showin' up on the daily races
My pocket's rarely racist
Couldn't God be my hustle to barely trace it
I keep a double where your mo is just to waste it
Top of the food chain
Your chain lookin' tasty

Dollar in my pocket, million on my mind
My hustle in the bus so now my gun's my only pride
Top of the food chain
I gotta eat I gotta eat
Top of the food chain
I gotta eat I gotta eat

Ants among thieves
Put you on the hook, motherfucker now you're meat
