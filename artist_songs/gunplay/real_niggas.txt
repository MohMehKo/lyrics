[Hook:]
I got real niggas that drink, real niggas that smoke
I got real niggas with pain, real niggas who broke
I got real niggas with OZs, real niggas with bricks
Real niggas who blow trees, real niggas who sniff
Real niggas who snow, real niggas who won't
Real niggas who sip leen strapped up at fifteen
Real niggas that gang bang, real niggas that claim blood
Real niggas that creep walk, show them boys the same love

[Verse 1:]
I know real niggas that snort mali
Real niggas that caught bodies
Real niggas with no charges
Little jits with no consciousness
Real niggas that's bitch, and just wanna see you eat
Ain't gonna front your blocker to and get you right back on your feet
Now that's a real nigga, I vouch that
A real nigga gon' bounce back
Lame niggas gonna pump up
A real nigga gonna house that.
Pussy niggas be playing but my money ain't no game
You play with that there,
You gon' lay with that there change
I know real niggas that buck trial
Buck wild, what now?
No space, no room, fuck new move, watch out!
Real nigga, that's all I be
Real thief, that's all I see
Real ratchet, that's all I am
Still ratching, that's all I need

[Hook:]
I got real niggas that drink, real niggas that smoke
I got real niggas with pain, real niggas who broke
I got real niggas with OZs, real niggas with bricks
Real niggas who blow trees, real niggas who sniff
Real niggas who snow, real niggas who won't
Real niggas who sip leen strapped up at fifteen
Real niggas that gang bang, real niggas that claim blood
Real niggas that creep walk, show them boys the same love
