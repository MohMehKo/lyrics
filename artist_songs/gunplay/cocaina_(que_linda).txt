[Intro:]
If you don't fuck with Evil Empire
Well then you're just a bitch ass trick
Cocaine's a hell of a drug

[Bridge:]
Gimme a...
Blazer, blay ay now
Gimme a...
Blazer, blay ay now
Gimme a...

Blazer, I'm tryna cut er
She say she from Madison, I'm tryna cut er
She say she from Madison, I'm tryna cut er
She say she from Madison, I'm tryna cut er

[Hook:]
Cocaina, que linda
Just watch that pretty girl rock
Cocaina, que linda
Just watch that pretty girl rock
Cocaina, que linda

(She say she from Madison)
Cocaina, que linda

(She say she from Madison)

[Verse 1:]
Columbia, my regime
Bogota, you ain't said a thing
Italy, the bodies
The alley, the violence
The beauty, the bithces
The trenches, the henchmen's
The glory, the vengeance
The 8 story house without fences

[Hook:]
Cocaina, que linda
Just watch that pretty girl rock
Cocaina, que linda
Just watch that pretty girl rock
Cocaina, que linda
Just watch that pretty girl rock
(She say she from Madison)
Cocaina, que linda
Just watch that pretty girl rock
(She say she from Madison)

[Verse 2:]
Pablo, Grizelda
Cold world, no shelter
The barrios, the poverty
This shit you see on TV â€“ comedy
The culture, the cartel
The vultures, the pal betters
The crooked police, they won't bail
And the baddest of the baddest bitch is on sale

[Hook:]
Cocaina, que linda
Just watch that pretty girl rock
Cocaina, que linda
Just watch that pretty girl rock
Cocaina, que linda
Just watch that pretty girl rock
(She say she from Madison)
Cocaina, que linda
Just watch that pretty girl rock
(She say she from Madison)
