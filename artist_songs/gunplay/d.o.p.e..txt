Dope ride, dope life
Dope brown, dope white

Dope ride, dope life
Dope brown, dope white

D O P E (D O P E)
D O P E (D O P E)

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
Dope in my dome, Dope in my trunk
Every flavor of dope I got it, you can come get come get what you want
Dope all in my swisha, when my dope is gone I'll miss er
Dope gon get you killed
Well dope gon get me richer
Dope all on my dinner table, dope gon get me dinner baby
Dope gon put me on a jet and fly me out to Venezuela
Dope gon get me pussy, dope gon put me on
Dope gon get me way more money then this fuckin song
My dope, right here right now
Right here, right in my cup
You got that dope money? Let's swap out in the parking lot
Dope got my pety straight
Dope got my linen stained
Dope in my Chevrolet, so much dope we should celebrate

[Hook: Gunplay]

[Verse 2: Young Breed]
Dope car, dope bitch
Dope spot, dope kicks
Dope money, dope boy
Ho I got that dope dick
Dope feet, dope fair
Dope dealers, don't care
Dope good on wood
Hanging out my dope whip
All my crew has got dope in it
Kill yo ass and go get it
Jump right in that dope business
Boy I'm gon probably go up in it
Know what's up but I stay down
Different dope for me the same clown
Dope ball on my 8 round
Doped up cause I'm paid now

[Bridge:]
D O P E, she wanted me
Or just the money I'm gon make up off this quarter key
D O P E, no you can't smoke for free
But you can hear this choppa from the other street

[Hook: Gunplay]

[Verse 3: Torch]
Dope crib, dope 'Rari
Dope dealin dope boys
Dope rollie all my dogs told my jeweler Audemar
Dope flows, no debatin
Dope money my motivation
Dope aim clip your sprinkle dope?
Now it's dope related
Double M in my click dope
My clique winning and my bitch dope
Fore I need to stalk on my victim
Fore I dropped it out from 5th door
Dope 5, dope shoes
Swerving with my young jews
IPhone full of dope shooters
I waive that chopper, nigga don't move
D O P E, get it through yo brain nigga
Torch been thrown, been tripped, been a made nigga
D O P E, every time I hit the track
My dope tin, no pretendin
If not you could bring it back
