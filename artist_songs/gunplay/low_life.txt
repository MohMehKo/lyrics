I don't ride no more
Steal a ride, I pack a 2
Ski a slow, act a fool
I'm a murker ghoul
You don't want my true circle dude
And these killers gonna do what they think they do

Everything I say so goddamn low life
Every song I play so goddamn low life
Hard class steel, such a goddamn low life
Pride, cash deals, such a goddamn low life
Low life, low life
Low life my whole life
Low life, low life
Low life my whole life

Human methadone now leave me the F alone
Human methadone now leave me the F alone
Human methadone now leave me the F alone
I take your bitch and F her dome
It's me they wishin' death upon
Human methadone now leave me the F alone
I take your bitch and F her dome
It's me they wishin' death upon
F 'em all, safety on the F-in off
Call the trauma truck I'm a check his pulse
Swing back, Ridge Mars, search and destroy
All I have in this world is a pistol passport
Now I throw my dues up in the two thousand new some
Rainin' cats and dogs but I don't want the roof up
Get your ishy here I got deuce
You disappear like bishop Pierce, I do not choose
My angle obtuse, Triple C my family tree
I ain't roots, I ain't see, I ain't do

Everything I say so goddamn low life
Every song I play so goddamn low life
Hard class steel, such a goddamn low life
Pride, cash deals, such a goddamn low life
Low life, low life
Low life my whole life
Low life, low life
Low life my whole life

I just shot and been shot at, rob robbers, boss bosses 'round
Hoes in needs, reel the fortune stack
Low life, wouldn't trust the neither
Pedigree amphetamine feel, pills 'round the reefer
Have these niggers' women, never bought dollars
We just wait for you again, now we all got 'em
All papers chief, this PO makes me sick
Another test stress, fuck it, use the paper pins
Low life, been ply
Party harder than that day they murdered Bin Laden
Black and yellow chains, black and yellow fit
When I throw co legal wait before I cut the check

Everything I say so goddamn low life
Every song I play so goddamn low life
Hard class steel, such a goddamn low life
Pride, cash deals, such a goddamn low life
Low life, low life
Low life my whole life
Low life, low life
Low life my whole life

Went through my low life fast
Still lovin' these strip clubs
Dance is off for two hundred but I'm on the pill and I'm six ducks
Low life of my whole life to my paper loan
My trap doin' so good, might go to extra zones
And I ain't even talkin' about no clean money
I'm talkin' cold profit that keep that triple bean jumpin'
Hundred thousand dollar car but ain't no fuckin' gas
I'm one hundred in the hood, you had to pay to pass
Robbin' for the same work we go to you
Might take all your new shit, look like it's old to you
That purple in my swisher got me seeing shit
I just bought another chopper that ain't seen the quip

Everything I say so goddamn low life
Every song I play so goddamn low life
Hard class steel, such a goddamn low life
Pride, cash deals, such a goddamn low life
Low life, low life
Low life my whole life
Low life, low life
Low life my whole life
