Gats under my Gucci belt, tats on my arm
Sliddin' up her ocean drive, comin' down like uh
Sliddin' up her ocean drive, comin' down like uh

Gat under my belt, capitol murder in my palm
My thought be so perverted, thinkin of fuckin' all of your moms
Cause I'm a motherfuckin' big dog and I don't fuck with law
Shape up your set, snip, get clipped off
Back cloud over my head, black label in my veins
Black 40 on my lap, black future in this game
It's crucial out here man, stayin' sane, tryna sustain
Coward, no such thing, my bounty more than my chain
Swastika on my tat, smockin' tropical crack
I pay way you no rap then wet gain get racks
Talkin' shit in my tennis, on my turf chargin' these tenants
I been broke befo', beaten, yoker broken antennas

Gats under my Gucci belt, tats on my arm
Sliddin' up her ocean drive, comin' down like uh
Sliddin' up her ocean drive, comin' down like uh
Gats under my Gucci belt
Gats under my Gucci belt
Tats on my arm
Sliddin' up her ocean drive, comin' down like uh

Bogota bitch
I told you, I'm Bogota, bitch
