Ohhhh, I’m addicted to the way that you move

She’s got hair like the yellow brick road
And I want her to take me home.
She’s got a beautiful name that I don’t know.

You know that you don’t make it easy
And you know that it’s not how it should be.
Why don’t you leave it up to me?
‘Cause I’ve fallen and I’m falling.

Ohhhh, I’m addicted to the way that you move
Ohhhh, you’re addicted too and I don’t know what to do.

What, what have I gotten myself into?
What, what have I gotten myself into?

Our eyes lock but I’ve lost the key
And she’s getting close to me.
You’re so hot but I need some air to breathe.

You know that you don’t make it easy
And you know that it’s not how it should be.
Why don’t you leave it up to me?
‘Cause I’ve fallen and I’m falling.

Ohhhh, I’m addicted to the way that you move
Ohhhh, you’re addicted too and I don’t know what to do.

What, what have I gotten myself into?
What, what have I gotten myself into?
