If the world is made on hellos and goodbyes,
How can you say it’ll all be fine?
‘Cause when we fall asleep,
We don’t share the same dreams; we don’t share the same dreams -
Our hearts are splitting at the seams.

One day you will know

We’re strangers who came together too soon,
These lives that we’ve fallen into.
The saddest part is I know it’s true,
I’m carelessly loving you.

The world is made on hellos and goodbyes,
So how can you say it’ll all be fine?

One day you will
One day you will know

We’re strangers who came together too soon,
These lives that we’ve fallen into.
The saddest part is I know it’s true,
I’m carelessly loving you.
This fire we started is now just an ember
And it’s something I’ll always remember.
‘Cause we’re strangers who came together too soon
And I’m carelessly loving you.

I’m carelessly loving you.
