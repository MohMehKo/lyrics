Living M.I.A
I've been here, before
Tell me what's your alibi 
Cause I don't know, anymore

But I was running, running scared,
From your love 
And I can't go no go nowhere 
If it does
They say out of sight out of mind
But you won't leave my mine

We could steal all the stars in the sky 
Till the morning comes
Laying drunk with the night falling in our arms
Even I, couldn't help to think 
That it's criminal, criminal

Living M.I.A 
From LA to New York
Tell me has our love gone dry?
Cause I don't know, if I'm yours

But I was running, running scared 
From you, love
And I can't go no, go nowhere
It's fucked up
They say out of sight out of mind
But you won't leave my mine

We could steal all the stars in the sky 
Till the morning comes
Laying drunk with the night falling in our arms
Even I, couldn't help to think 
That it's criminal, criminal

We could steal all the stars in the sky 
Till the morning comes
Laying drunk with the night falling in our arms
Even I, couldn't help to think 
That it's criminal, criminal

We could steal all the stars in the sky 
Till the darkness came
You and I, with the night
Living M.I.A
And I couldn't help to think 
That it's criminal, 
Baby that it's criminal

We could steal all the stars in the sky 
Till the morning comes
Laying drunk with the night falling in our arms
Even I, couldn't help to think 
That it's criminal, criminal

We could steal all the stars in the sky 
Till the morning comes
Laying drunk with the night falling in our arms
Even I, couldn't help to think 
That it's criminal, criminal

Steal all the stars in the sky
Laying drunk with the night
Even I couldn't help to think that it's criminal
Baby that it's criminal
