The streets we know won’t take us where we want to go.
The way we walk our footsteps echo (echo).

Lights flicker as we wander
Lets stay a while longer

We’ll wait until its dark and travel by the light of the moon,
As we do what they fear we will.
We’re just kids in cars trying not to wake the sun,
‘Cause we are, we are the lucky ones.

I watch you wipe the fog off the window with your sleeve.
You show me things that I have never seen.

Place your hips between my hands,
Lets reinvent romance.

Lights flicker as we wander
Lets stay a while longer

We’ll wait until its dark and travel by the light of the moon,
As we do what they fear we will.
We’re just kids in cars trying not to wake the sun,
‘Cause we are, we are the lucky ones.

Find a way to runaway from nothing.

We’ll wait until its dark and travel by the light of the moon,
As we do what they fear we will.
We’re just kids in cars trying not to wake the sun,
‘Cause we are, we are the lucky ones.
