Woah, Woah
Woah, Woah

I never saw a girl wear green so well
By the way you dress you got something to tell
It’s a bittersweet taste when our lips meet
And it tells me that it’s over

You and I are going down

My heart sinks like its tied to an anchor
And I would just like to thank you.

Woah, Woah
Woah, Woah

I’ve never seen a screen for this drama queen
Your negativity was killing me
Just say the words that I need to hear
And tell me that it’s over

You and I are going down

My heart sinks like its tied to an anchor
And I would just like to thank you.
My heart sinks like its tied to an anchor
And I would just like to thank you.

You left your dress under my bed
(How was I supposed to know)
You left your mess inside my head

My heart sinks like its tied to an anchor
And I would just like to thank you.
I’ve been thinking, that you are the anchor
And I would just like to thank you.
