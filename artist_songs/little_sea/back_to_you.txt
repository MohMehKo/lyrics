Never thought, that you would turn the page
It’s not your fault, but who else is there to blame

We go up, we go down, and we crash to the ground
You’re no longer yourself
We were lost we were found now we’re circling round
And we turn on ourselves. 

I keep running away to get back to you now, back to you now
I keep finding myself trying to find you somehow find you somehow
It’ll never be the same again, like the way we were back then 
I keep running away to get back to you now, back to you now

My mind, paints a picture of your face
But each day, your colours seem to change, oh

We go up, we go down, and we crash to the ground
You’re no longer yourself
We were lost we were found now we’re circling round
And we turn on ourselves

I keep running away to get back to you now, back to you now
I keep finding myself trying to find you somehow find you somehow
It’ll never be the same again, like the way we were back then 
I keep running away to get back to you now, back to you now

We go up, we go down, and we crash to the ground
You’re no longer yourself
We were lost we were found now we’re circling round
And we turn on ourselves

I keep running away to get back to you now, back to you now
I keep finding myself trying to find you somehow find you somehow
(Can’t stop, can’t stop running)
It’ll never be the same again, like the way we were back then 
(Can’t stop, can’t stop running away)
I keep running away to get back to you now, back to you now, back to you
