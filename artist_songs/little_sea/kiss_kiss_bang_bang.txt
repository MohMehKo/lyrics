I’ve been looking through the store window
But I’ve already bought, everything that they’ve got.
Chasing shadows is a game I play,
I’m the winner here, that’s why they disappear.

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You’re in denial been here for a while

oh oh oh oh oh oh

You can see it from a mile

If it looks like this, baby it probably is.
How did it end up like this?
Oh oh oh oh oh, woah oh oh
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

We’ve been stuck here on this carousel
But we can make it stop, if we just both get off.
They have played our song for far too long,
Lets take it off repeat and dance to a new beat.

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You’re in denial been here for a while

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You can see it from a mile

If it looks like this, baby it probably is.
How did it end up like this?
Oh oh oh oh oh, woah oh oh
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

Small talk and wide eyed kisses,
How did it end up like this?
Oh oh oh oh oh, woah oh oh
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

And we knew right from the start
What we had would fall apart
But for now lets keep on falling in love.

Hey, Hey!

If it looks like this, baby it probably is.
How did it end up like this?
Oh oh oh oh oh, woah oh oh
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

Small talk and wide eyed kisses,
How did it end up like this?
Oh oh oh oh oh, woah oh oh
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
