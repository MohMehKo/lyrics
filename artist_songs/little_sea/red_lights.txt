Breathe out, I let you in
Now you think you really know me
Deep down under my skin
Where you always wanted to be
Would I wear it thin
The heart upon my sleeve
And I breathe out, I let you in
Now you think you really own me

Don't you know
Don't you know
You're using up my love
Don't you know
Don't you know

All I see is red lights
Every time you're around
Gravity's on my side
You're still letting me down
I need to take control
Let you go
Turn off all these red lights
I never see you around
You're just another face in the crowd

Breathe in the words to say 
Dancing on the tip of my tongue
We've been at it for days
Screaming till the meaning goes numb
You will cheat the game
Did you just play me for fun
And I breathe in the words to say
Held them back for far too long

Don't you know
Don't you know,
You're using up my love
Don't you know
Don't you know

All I see is red lights
Every time you're around
Gravity's on my side
You're still letting me down
I need to take control
Let you go
Turn off all these red lights
Never see you around
You're just another face in the crowd

You're still letting me down

Don't you know
Don't you know
You're using up my love
Don't you know
Don't you know

All I see is red lights
Every time you're around
Gravity's on my side
You're still letting me down 
(You're still letting me down)
I need to take control
Let you go
Turn off all these red lights
Never see you around
You're just another face in the crowd
