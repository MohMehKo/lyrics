Sea foam green eyes, I drown in them every time, I see your tide rise
Tied to kite strings, drift away from everything, to see what the wind brings

Let it take, take, take you home.

Paper raincoat girl living in her stormy weather world, weather world

We bridge our fingers, closing the space between us - secret whispers
We'll sail down your street in tiny boats made out of leaves, to see where the stream leads

Let it take, take, take you home.

I won't stop loving the girl in the rain
'Cause I see you're soaked to the bone 
I'll keep on loving the girl in the rain 
Let me take, take, take you home
