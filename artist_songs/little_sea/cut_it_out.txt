Your lips are famous
So why are they tasteless?
I want my 15 minutes
So why that clock stop ticking 
You said you want it
Thought you were honest
I'm pulling on my collar
We're pushing on each other 

They say the ones that we love yeah they hurt most 
Won't you let me go 

Don't go telling me I'm not allowed
You're the one who fucked around 
What the hell was that about?
Crushing on you so hard but every time you crush me down
Love me then you cuss me out
Maybe you should cut it out 
Love me then you cuss me out 
Maybe you should cut it out
Maybe you should cut it out 

Baby you're still playing 
And what you're saying 
I'm still falling for it
Blew a kiss I caught it
I wanna break it 
But when I'm wasted 
I know that I'll be calling cause I can't help it

They say the ones that we love yeah they hurt the most 
Won't you let me go 

Don't go telling me I'm not allowed
You're the one who fucked around
What the hell was that about?
Crushing on you so hard but every time you crush me down
Love me then you cuss me out
Maybe you should cut it out 
Love me then you cuss me out 
Maybe you should cut it out 

Maybe you should cut it out 
Maybe you should cut it out 

Never again
Cause my love doesn't matter
Never again
Here's my heart you can have it
Never again
Cut it out with your dagger
I know that I'll be there when you call me

Don't go telling me I'm not allowed 
You're the one who fucked around 
What the hell was that about?
Crushing on you so hard but every time you crush me down 
Love me then you cuss me out 
Maybe you should cut it out 
Love me then you cuss me out
Maybe you should cut it out 

Maybe you should cut it out
Maybe you should cut...
