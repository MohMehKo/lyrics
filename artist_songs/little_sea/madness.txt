Welcome to the party baby
We're gonna move it to the beat 
Of whatever, I don't care
Walk in with your heart and maybe
You'll wanna leave it all behind 
And leave with mine, oh, mine, oh

Everybody wants you
But not everybody needs you like I do

Stuck in emotion
Is this some kind of madness?
Caught up in the moment
It's just some kind of madness

Welcome to the party baby
This summer's gonna bring the heat
But whatever, I'm not scared
Cause were already partly crazy
And we'll be sweating to the beat 
In bed all night
All night oh

Everybody wants you
But not everybody needs you like I do

Stuck in emotion
Is this some kind of madness?
Caught up in the moment
It's just some kind of madness

And I know 
We all go a little bit crazy sometimes
But as far as it goes
I can see a little bit of crazy in your eyes

Stuck in emotion
Is this some kind of madness?
Caught up in the moment
It's just some kind of madness
