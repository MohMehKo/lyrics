I see the look in your eyes
You keep dark thoughts under white lies
You stop talking but I know there's more

'Cause underneath your makeup
You try to hide away but
There's nothing that you need to make up for

You be you and I'll be me
When the morning comes you'll see
I'll be right here waiting
So please just know

You don't have to change for love
You don't have to change for love
'Cause you already are enough
You don't have to change for love

Even when you feel you're falling
You turn to face the wall and
You count the reasons that you've had enough

'Cause even when you're in pieces
You're still a masterpiece and
Don't ever feel like you don't measure up

You be you and I'll be me
When the morning comes you'll see
I'll be right here waiting
So please just know

You don't have to change for love
You don't have to change for love
'Cause you already are enough
You don't have to change for love

For love
For love
You wanna shout but it's trapped within
You gotta let it out so you can let me in, for love

You don't have to change for love
You don't have to change for love
'Cause you already are enough
You don't have to change for love

You don't have to change for love
You don't have to change for love
'Cause you already are enough
You don't have to change for love
