Holding all the cards you know
Can't escape from you
Trembling I feel the high
Let me see you move

Tensions winning
Touch your skin

I can see the look in your eyes 
Let me set the mood
Can you feel the adrenaline rise?
Let's keep, keep, keep 
Lets keep this shit on loop

Let's keep this shit on loop
(Keep this shit on loop)
Let's keep this shit on loop

Syncopate my heart with yours
Turning with the tape
Let's take this to another high
Somewhere outta space

Tensions winning
Touch your skin

I can see the look in your eyes 
Let me set the mood
Can you feel the adrenaline rise?
Let's keep, keep, keep
Let's keep this shit on loop

Let's keep this shit on loop
(Keep this shit on loop)
Let's keep this shit on loop
(Keep this shit on loop)...

I can see the look in your eyes 
Let me set the mood
Can you feel the adrenaline rise?
Let's keep, keep, keep 
lets keep this shit on loop

Let's keep this shit on loop
Let's keep this shit on loop
(Keep this shit on loop)...
