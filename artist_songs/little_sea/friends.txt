Shirt buttoned to the neck
In check
Time to let go
Ruby red lipstick
Smoke rises like a signal

Stealing half of the day just to spend at night
Stealing hearts when the break under UV lights
Cause their walk if full of empty
Talk
Talk
Talk

I've got friends
Who have got friends
Talkin bout the weekend
We make plans
Just to make plans
But we never keep them

I've got friends
Who have got friends
Talkin bout the weekend
We make plans
Just to make plans
But we never keep them

How you dress I'm impressed
But you acting like you don't care
Is your smile out of style
Just like the brands that you don't wear
Stealing half of the day just to spend at night
Stealing hearts when the break under UV lights
Cause their lungs are full of awkward
Cough
Cough
Coughs

I've got friends
Who have got friends
Talkin bout the weekend
We make plans
Just to make plans
But we never keep them

I've got friends
Who have got friends
Talkin bout the weekend
We make plans
Just to make plans
But we never keep them

So go and tell all your friends
Lonely is the latest trend
So go and tell all your friends
Lonely is the latest trend
So go and tell all your friends
Lonely is the latest trend
So go and tell all your friends

I've got friends
Who have got friends
Talkin bout the weekend
We make plans
Just to make plans
But we never keep them

I've got friends
Who have got friends
Talkin bout the weekend
We make plans
Just to make plans
But we never keep them

So go and tell all your friends
(I've got friends, who have got friends, talking bout the weekend)
Lonely is the latest trend
So go all tell all your friends
(We make plans, just to make plans, but we never keep them)
Lonely is the latest trend
So go all tell all your friends
