I don’t wanna leave
It feels like home
I didn’t plan for this

I don’t wanna leave
I just can’t go
If you’re not coming with

I know I can’t stay 
But if I did
Would there be room for two?

It’s not up to me 
I don’t wanna leave
So I leave it up to you

Was this just sweet nothing
Or could we have something more?

What if we slept through the sunrise?
Laid with our limbs tied
Eating breakfast in the afternoon
What if we covered the windows?
Turned all the lights low
Watching Netflix ‘til we see the moon

Darling you could be
Forever and a day with me
I just want you to see
That I don’t wanna leave

I don’t wanna leave
This feels like home 
I know what we should do

Come close to me
I won’t let you go
And you’ll be bulletproof

I know I can’t stay 
But if I did
Would there be room for two?

It’s not up to me 
I don’t wanna leave
So I leave it up to you

Was this just sweet nothing
Or could we have something more?

What if we slept through the sunrise?
Laid with our limbs tied
Eating breakfast in the afternoon
What if we covered the windows?
Turned all the lights low
Watching Netflix ‘til we see the moon

And darling you could be
Forever in a day with me
I just want you to see
That I don’t wanna leave

Oh if only you could see

Was this just sweet nothing?
‘Cause I’m about to fall

What if we slept through the sunrise?
Laid with our limbs tied
Eating breakfast in the afternoon
What if we covered the windows?
Turned all the lights low
Watching Netflix ‘til we see the moon

Oh yeah

What if we slept through the sunrise?
Laid with our limbs tied
Eating breakfast in the afternoon
What if we covered the windows?
Turned all the lights low
Watching Netflix ‘til we see the moon

And darling you could be
Forever and a day with me
I just want you to see
That I don’t wanna leave
