So far away but still so clear
And in my head you feel so near
So I'll close my eyes and fall asleep

And I will see you in my dreams
I don't wanna wait, anymore
In the paths of a closing door
And I don't wanna wait anymore
Your all I need

I miss the words you say half asleep
And the way you'd only tell them to me
When the world revolves around us
I miss the way you so nervously
Held my shirt when it came time to leave
So why won't the world revolve around us?

So is this heart ache I will take
Can love be lost without a trace?
Till we go our seperate ways
Or is this path ours to make?

And I don't like this state of mind
The only the compromise is if you were mine
And I don't wanna wait anymore
Your all I need

I miss the words you say half asleep
And the way you'd only tell them to me
When the world revolves around us
I miss the way you so nervously
Held my shirt when it came time to leave
So why won't the world revolve around us?

Gimme little more
Gimme little more
I still want you like I did before
Gimme little more
Give me something more

A-ooh (Gimme little more)
A-ooh (Gimme little more)
A-ooh (I still want you like I did before)
A-ooh (Gimme little more)
A-ooh (Gimme little more)
A-ooh (I still want you like I did before)

I miss the words you say half asleep
And the way you'd only tell them to me
When the world revolves around us
I miss the way you so nervously
Held my shirt when it came time to leave
So why won't the world revolve around us?
So why won't the world revolve around us?
So why won't the world revolve around us?
