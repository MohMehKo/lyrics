I see them rise
From beneath the ground
Life was lost but now it's found
The ghosts want somethin'
To take their turn
To dance around the stone
Work the fingers to the bone
Hold on to nothin'

Day for the dead,
To dance among the living
Day for the dead
To dance among the living

We find forgiveness
For the wrong we've done
Watch the dyin' of the day
Another settin' sun
We find redemption
In the love that we've won
Just a little company
Until our work is done

Day for the dead
To dance among the living
Day for the dead
To dance among the living

Who says you can't go back?
Who says you can't go back,
Back to where you started from? (are you runnin' away?)
Who says you can't go back? (are you runnin' away?)
Who says you can't go back,
Back to where you started from? (are you runnin' away?)
Who says you can't go back? (are you runnin' away?)

[2x]
The moon falls on the river Styx
The man will meet you there
Coins lay on your eyes
Just to pay his fare

Day for the dead
To dance among the living

Day for the dead
To dance among the living
Day for the dead
To dance among the living
