I know it ain't easy
'Cause I'm the kind of man that makes it hard to love
I just wanna believe that all this runnin'
Could lead to all this comin' back around

I'm in it for the long haul
Long haul
I'm in it for the long haul

Let's pick up the pieces
Find a way to come back home from all this hurt
I just wanna believe that we still got it
So let's stop all our fighting and make it work

I'm in for the long haul
Long Haul
Long Haul

These dead ends roads all look the same
But I know our love could lead the way like
Headlights shinin' in the dark
There's nothin' for us in this town
Honey, this time we ain't slowin, down, fo
Best we leave our past in the dust
Oh, ho, ho, ho-oh

Long Haul
Long Haul

We finally made it out this heartbreak town
Notin' in the world could keep us down
Take my hand, you and me, we're gonna make it out
Tired of bein' broke in this heartache town
We don't wanna live this loney, I
And I ain't givin up on us

I'm in for the long haul
Long Haul
Long Haul
I'm in for the long haul
