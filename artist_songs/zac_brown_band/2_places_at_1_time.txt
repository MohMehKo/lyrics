I've seen the northern lights
Paint the sky in shades of green
And I've seen the daisy's dress of white
Laying on those mountain peaks

And my heart knows a way back home
When the wind sings that old familiar song

'Cause I've been all around the world
Seen things that no one would believe
Thought I was lookin' at a picture
In some fancy magazine
And out of everywhere I've been
Oh it kills me every time
If I could only find how to be 2 places at 1 time
2 places at 1 time

I've seen the sun spin weeds of gold
On those Oklahoma plains
I've seen the moon a million times
On those Santa Rosa waves

And my heart knows a way back home
When the wind sings that old familiar song

'Cause I've been all around the world
Done things that no one would believe
Thought I was livin' in a movie on that giant silver screen
And out of everywhere I've been
Oh it kills me every time
If a man could just divide, I could be 2 places at 1 time
2 places at 1 time

How can I keep what I got when I don't know what I'm missin'
Needing islands when I'm home
Miss my family when I'm gone
I'm gone, gone, gone

'Cause I've been all around this world
Lived things that no one would believe
Never thought I'd move so many people
That gave this life to me
And out of everywhere I've been
Oh it kills me every time
Maybe I'd be satisfied if I could just divide, and be 2 places at 1 time
2 places at 1 time
2 places at 1 time
