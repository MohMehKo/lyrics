The day you went away, was the day I was safe
Now you're just a soul
Even God can't save
And you'll spend your days, trading cigarettes
Don't matter what you say, or if you have regrets
And I know and I know...
There's no more tears
Cause' you're gone and you're gone...
For thirty years
I'm sure to God you'll turn, that's what they all do
Soon enough you'll learn, that he saw right through
Don't ever try to call, I'm not here no more
I've gone far away, I've locked all my doors
No matter what you say, no matter what you say
No matter what you do, no matter what you do
You know you're going to hell, you know you're going to hell
And I'm not coming, I'm not coming
With you
And I know and I know...
There's no more tears
Cause' you gone and you're gone...
For thirty years
And I know and I know...
There's no more tears
Cause' you're gone and you're gone...
For thirty years
