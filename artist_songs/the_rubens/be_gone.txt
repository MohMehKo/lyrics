Hold on, I said that I'd be there for you
So why are you running away
Then be gone
I said be proper gone
I'll find a better you someday
You'll probably find a guy like me
With more money, but more ugly
And then he'll cheat, and then you'll see
That we're all the same and you shoulda never left me
Well be strong, I know you think that I'm in the wrong
But one day you'll succumb to the truth
And you'll mourn, the battle that I finally won
I'll celebrate and you'll be confused
You'll probably find a guy like me
With more money, but more ugly
And then he'll cheat, and then you'll see
That we're all the same and you shoulda never left me
Well hold one, I said that I'd be there for you
So why are you running away
Well be gone
Be proper gone
I'll find a better you someday
