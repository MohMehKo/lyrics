Blood stains won't make it matter
Got good things, got you
Hoops and everything
Get back never get back too soon
Are you lonely
Are you there when I'm not in the room
Are you only
Only a part of this when you choose
Is it real
Is it something that you can not touch
Do you feel
Do you feel that you feel too much

Blood stains won't make it matter
Got good things, got you
Hoops and everything
Get back never get back too soon
Blood stains make confusing patterns
That lead me to you
Hoops and everything
Get back never get back too soon

Something crazy
Something changing in the way you talk
You are lately
Lately you are trying to be the one on top
Come on down
Come on and give it to me like you should
Gonna drown
I give up and get on with the life lived good

Say it all on the telephone
Say it in my head
Say it in my head
Say it in my head

Write it down all the things gone wrong
And the ink ran red
And the ink ran red
And the ink ran red

Blood stains won't make it matter
Got good things, got you
Hoops and everything
Get back never get back too soon
Get back never get back too soon
Get back never get back too soon
Get back never get back
Get back never get back
Get back never get back too soon
Get back never get back too soon
Yes its true
Hoops and everything
Get back never get back too soon
Get back never get back too soon
Get back never get back too soon
Get back never get back
Get back never get back
