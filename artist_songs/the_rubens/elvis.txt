Truth be told
I want to grow old with you
With you
Cause what we've got
Is all that want, it's true
It's true

[Chorus:]
It gets easier to love you
And sometimes it's hard
But we've made it this far
We'll get through
And I don't know why sometimes I upset you
It gets easier to love you

People say
We'll marry one day
Someday, one day
But don't hold your breath
There's loads of time left
Let's stay young, let's stay young

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
