I gave her the means, she had the will
I kept on pushing for the kill
I never thought she'd finish me
But she shut me down, and left me to bleed

With my gun
My gun, my gun
My gun, my gun
My gun

Opened my eyes, my body cold
It shouldn't end this way
I want to grow old
Scrambled to my feet
And stumbled home
I forgave my girl
But I don't want to be alone

She took me back and stitched me up
The whole time smiling
Cause she'd won

But one day I'll get back
My gun, my gun, my gun
My gun, my gun, my gun

She took me back and stitched me up
The whole time smiling
Cause she'd won

But one day I'll get back
My gun, my gun, my gun
My gun, my gun, my gun
