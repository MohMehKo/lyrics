One more, more or less then we're done
Can't be sure if we had fun
Sweet sixteen been and gone
Eighteen next year then we're done

Girls like me if they're younger
But girls my age want guys older
Guess I'm just stuck in the middle
Between easies and girls unattainable

[Hook:]
Yeah they say, these days
Are the best we got
What a tragic thought
And I try, and I try
Not to waste this time
But it just flies by
The more I try

Slow down, don't speak, say something
Line up, don't cheat, stop staring
Sit down, shut up, start learning
Time's us, get out, start working

[Hook x2]
