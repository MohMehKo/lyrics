It's cold outside, and I'm not quite
Ready for the morning light
My hands are tied, cause if I tried
To leave this place I'd surely die
I'd surely die

[Chorus x2:]
Hey, hey, hey
I'd surely die
I'd surely die

The stories of way back when
A guy got out and made it there
I think I'm gonna give it a try
Even though I'd surely die
I'd surely die

[Chorus x2]

[Chorus x2]
