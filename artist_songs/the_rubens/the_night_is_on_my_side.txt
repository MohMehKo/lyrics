The night is on my side
And I'm young enough to fall in love
And be all starry eyed
With anyone I find
Yeah
The night is on my side
And it's young enough that for the time being
Time is on my side

She says she loves the moonlight
And the way it pulls the tides
But it's just daylight in disguise
And it will lead to all demise
Yeah
The night ain't on your side
And come to think of it
Neither am I

I won't say you ain't special
But you ain't nothin' new
Maybe it's just the lateness
And just something to do
Don't say I ain't special
Cause there ain't nothin' more cruel
We just get blowny at nine and stoney
But who cares?
The night is on our side
The night is on our side
The night is on our side
It's on our side

The night is on my side
A suck up bunch just spark with lust
An infamous supply
Darlin' don't shy
Yeah
The night is on our side
As you fall for me I fall for my own lies

I won't say you ain't special
But you ain't nothin' new
Maybe it's just the lateness
And just something to do
Don't say I ain't special
Cause there ain't nothin' more cruel
We just get blowny at nine and stoney
But who cares?
The night is on our side
The night is on our side
The night is on our side
It's on our side

I won't say you ain't special
But you ain't nothin' new
Maybe it's just the lateness
And just something to do
Don't say I ain't special
Cause there ain't nothin' more cruel
We just get blowny at nine and stoney
But who cares?
The night is on our side
The night is on our side
The night is on our side
It's on our side
It's on our side
The night is on our side
It's on our, it's on our, it's on our side
