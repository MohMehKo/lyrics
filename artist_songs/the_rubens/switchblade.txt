No guilt-free questions are asked
Oh you got nothing on me
Yeah... Ohh...

So put down your switchblade mami
You got no business being here
Being here

Put your hands down girl don't fight
I see the sadness in your eyes
I wanna love you
So wanna love you

You won't be the guy who's frozen
Fist up in the air
Please notice me...
Please notice me

If you were'nt such an asshole I'll
Be your buddy, be your friend
Be your soulmate, I'll be your best guy
And I'll help you through

Put your hands down girl don't fight
I see the sadness in your eyes
I wanna love you
So wanna love you

In the darkness we lose our mind
Just nothing, there's no time
I wanna love you
I wanna love you

So put down your switchblade mami
You've got no business being here
Being here

I wanna love you

Put your hands down girl don't fight
I see the sadness in your eyes
I wanna love you
So wanna love you
So wanna love you

In the darkness we lose our mind
Just nothing, there' no time
I wanna love you
So wanna love you

Put your hands down girl don't fight
I see the sadness in your eyes
I wanna love you
So wanna love you
So wanna love you
Still wanna love you
