I found myself that day
There was no other way
I'd spent some time away
I'd never be the same

I finally was awake
Like water to my face
I'd finally found my place
I'd never be the same
I'd never be the same

It took something bad, to show me what I had
It took something sad, to remember who I am

I was forced to change
I'm not sure who to thank
Yeah I was such a waste
I'd never be the same
I'd never be the same

It took something bad, to show me what I had
It took something sad, to remember who I am

I found myself that day
There was no other way
I'd spent some time away
I'd never be the same
