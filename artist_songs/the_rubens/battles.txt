Yeah I got some battle scars
Doesn't matter who you are
Take some time babe to earn my trust
And never let go of the past
Got a few things to see to
And I don't exactly need you
Made myself a promise
Never ever fall in love
Never ever fall in love

So I said I would call you
And I want to but I don't know if I should, yeah
Should I stoke this fire
Knowing full well if it gets out of hand I'm a crook, oh

Yeah I got some battle scars
Doesn't matter who you are
Take some time babe to earn my trust
And never let go of the past
Got a few things to see to
And I don't exactly need you
Made myself a promise
Never ever fall in love
Never ever fall in love

See you way too easy
It's about being at the right time
But it hasn't come yet, yeah
Think it's lost its meaning
Meaning in the mean time is better left unsaid
It's for the best, oh

Yeah
Oh no

Got a few things to see to
And I don't exactly need you
Made myself a promise
Never ever fall in love
Never ever fall in love
Never ever fall in love
Never ever fall in love

Yeah I got some battle scars
Doesn't matter who you are
Take some time babe to earn my trust
And never let go of the past
Got a few things to see to
And I don't exactly need you
Made myself a promise
Never ever fall in love
Never ever fall in love

Got a few things to see to
And I don't exactly need you
Made myself a promise
Never ever fall in love
Never ever fall in love
Never ever fall in love
