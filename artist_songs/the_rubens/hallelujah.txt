Well, you're a fool in the back with a book in your hand and no handle on front
You got the power to think and a heart with a beat, but you're using just one
I feel you're looking at me as if you're hoping to see I got a {foot} for a ton
'Cause I'm a son of a gun
Thank goodness you've come

(I'm saved)
Hallelujah, hallelujah, halle-
(I'm saved)
Hallelujah, hallelujah, halle-
(Too late)
What's it to ya, what's it to ya, what's it
(I'm saved)
Hallelujah, hallelujah, halle-

I'd like a kick in the teeth or a pat on the back if we're taking it slow
There'll be a sword in my side to siphon the life, create a venomous flow
You've got no message to preach, there's not a lot you can teach that I don't already know
'Cause I'm a son of a gun
And I'll wait 'til you're done

(I'm saved)
Hallelujah, hallelujah, halle-
(I'm saved)
Hallelujah, hallelujah, halle-
(Too late)
What's it to ya, what's it to ya, what's it
(I'm saved)
Hallelujah, hallelujah, halle-

Now I'm not sure of much but on love, you can bet that I ain't ever wrong
It's a thrill and a rush 'cause one moment it's here and the next it is gone
Chop me up into bits, put a pinch on my lips and call a feather a ton
'Cause I'm a son of a gun
Thank goodness you've come
'Cause I'm a son of a gun
'Cause I'm a son of a gun
I'mma wait 'til you're done
'Cause I'm a son of a gun

(I'm saved)
Hallelujah, hallelujah, halle-
(I'm saved)
Hallelujah, hallelujah, halle-
(Too late)
What's it to ya, what's it to ya, what's it
(I'm saved)
Hallelujah, hallelujah, halle-

(Don't wait)
{For me Hunter} I'll {be fault} to you forever
(Don't wait)
On my feeling that you're {needing, go and dance-uh}
(Just take)
Take a moment, slow your movement, now go faster
(I'm saved)
Not a loser, 'cause {you used her}, hallelujah
