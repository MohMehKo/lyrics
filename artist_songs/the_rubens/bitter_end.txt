So I guess you're hungry for revenge
and you'll fight me to the bitter end
Well I'm sure you'll leave nothing unsaid
What's your end game, I won't hold my breath

I won't hold my breath
I won't hold my breath
As there's nothing left,
I won't hold my breath.

Tiptoeing too close to the edge,
I ain't bothered by what she says he says
Say I'm unwell, as I'm cool, I'm a mess
Don't try and school me girl, unless

I won't hold my breath
I won't hold my breath
As there's nothing left
I don't hold my breath

I got a battle in my mind
I ain't better but I'm tryin
I don't need you by my side
I don't need you by my side
don't need you by my side

So I guess you're hungry for revenge
And you'll fight me til the better end
I'm sure you'll leave nothing unsaid
What's your end game, I won't hold my breath

I won't hold my breath
I won't hold my breath
Cause there's nothing left
I won't hold my breath
I won't hold my breath
I won't hold my breath
Cause there's nothing left
I won't hold my breath
