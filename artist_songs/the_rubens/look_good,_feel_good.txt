Ain't no need for your guns here baby
You you drove me away, yeah you made me
Hate myself, hate my job, love my friends but lose their love
And it's hard, to know you're still around but you're not mine
Now you're having fun with a dead man's son cause' he pleases you
And you know he's no good for you, but yet you do
Call me up, to keep me up I know it's you

You know, I won't have no pity, I won't shed no tears
Because I got, nothing to fear
Don't have no pity, don't shed no tears for me, not for me

Don't tell me you tried to save me
You kid yourself you're just the same as me
In other times, in other ways, we'll spend our lives wasting away
And it's hard, to know you're still around but you're not mine

Now I, told you once but I'll do it again
There's no way that we'll still be friends
I know it's still the same for you, cause you do

Call me up, to keep me up, I know it's you
You know, I won't have no pity, I won't shed no tears
Because I got, nothing to fear
Don't have no pity, don't shed no tears for me, not for me

Now you let me down, cause I let you down
Think it's best if I just left town
I'll find a place to settle down

Don't call me up, to keep me up I'll know it's you
Yeah you call me up, to keep me up I know it's you
