I come from a long line of lighthouse keepers
It's bright but very lonely inside
After four straight days awake
I begin to hallucinate
I see you feeding me blueberry pie

I'm a lumberjack
But you already knew that
From when you first saw my chiseled physique
Though I can fell a tall pine
Without batting an eye
I got a soft spot for baby trees

I keep a live lobster inside of my shirt
I can tame any creature of the sea
You make my temperature rise
And it's no surprise
I'm gonna steam it with my body heat

You may have heard that the leading cause of death in Maine
Is moose on the highway
But when riding with me
You can be worry free
I bathe in bear pee
And it keeps them at bay

(It keeps them at bay, baby.)
(Yeah, but you smell like bear pee.)

I wanna be your Maine man
Let me be your Maine man
Don't let him be your Maine man
I'm gonna be her Maine man

Girl, I can build you a cabin in a month
I can do it all by myself
But the truth is it'll take at least six months
And he'll make you and his cousin Glenn help
But I'll take you on a romantic cruise, ah
In my arctic exploration schooner
That's just what he wrote
On the side of his paddleboat
Don't go anywhere alone with this loser

Baby, don't listen to him
He didn't move to Maine until he was ten
But I know so much about Maine
I got Maine facts all up in my brain

Well what's the state fish?
The landlocked salmon
The state bird?
Black capped chickadee
The state fossil?
Pertica quadrifaria
The state insect?
European honeybee
The state gemstone?
Tourmaline
State herb?
Wintergreen
And the state cat is the Maine coon
The state animal is moose
The state mammal is moose
And the state girl of Maine is you

I wanna be your Maine man
Let me be your Maine man
I'm gonna be your Maine man
No, I wanna be your Maine man

I've been living in Maine
I've been working in Maine
I've got some cousins in Maine
I've been buying groceries in Maine
Been paying my taxes in Maine
I've been supporting the economy in Maine
And I'd like to get the child tax credit in Maine
But I'm gonna need some help with that girl

I wanna be your Maine man
