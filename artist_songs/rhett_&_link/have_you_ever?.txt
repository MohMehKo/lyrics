Have you ever had someone wake you up
Just to ask you if you're awake?
Has somebody ever waved to the person behind you
But you waved back anyway?

Have you ever searched days for your lost shades
And then found them on your forehead?
Have you ever slept all night on top of your arm
And felt for sure they'd have to amputate it?

Have you ever not heard what someone said
So you asked em to repeat it again?
But then the second time you understood it even less
So you just smiled and nodded your head

Have you ever been about to sneeze, then you freeze
It's a tease and you look like you have an awful disease?
Have you ever had your face grazed by your own hair
But you thought it was a spider and you got super scared.

Have you ever? Have you everrrrrr? (Feel free to share)
Have you ever? Have you everrrrrr? (We've all been there)

(Have you) ever wanted a snack that you've never tried
So you bought a bag of air but there were chips inside?
Have you been fully convinced your belt was a snake.
Or dated relatives by mistake?

Have you ever LOLSHTYWFOATYADYT?

Have you ever shot through space on the back of a cat?
Or had a dinosaur laugh at you because of your cheese hat?

Have you ever woken up early, finished your quarterly reports, brushed your teeth, taken a shower, put on a suit, eaten breakfast, pulled out of your driveway and then realized you don't have a job?

Have you ever been singing and opened a wormhole
In the middle of the chorus and it swallowed your soul?

Have you ever? Have you everrrrrr? (We've all been there)
