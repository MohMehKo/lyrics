[Link (Rhett and Nice Peter):]
Let's say hypothetically you're watching an internet video (Oh)
Go with me on this
And let's say hypothetically that this video hits a snag (Oh)
Get a little buffer action
The video froze
Now you must choose
How long are you willing to wait (10 seconds)
Before you click away (10 seconds)
Open up a new page (10 seconds)
Before you start to rage (10 seconds)
Sign up again and confirm your age (10 seconds)

[Rhett, Link and Nice Peter:]
15 seconds of fame
And 5 seconds for that

In 10 seconds

[Rhett (Link and Nice Peter):]
So you're at work
And you got a little hunger pain you see
So you head down the hall to find the vending machine
And you press F-14 because that's where the snack that you like resides
But when you press F-14 the coil gets stuck and your snack is still inside
So now you got to start shaking the machine and the question is
How long are you going to shake this machine
Until you begin to eat away at your own dignity (10 seconds)
Your wife packed your lunch (10 seconds)
Carrots, hummus and grapes in a bunch (10 seconds)
It's just a bag of Fritos (10 seconds)
Do you really need those Fritos

And 5 seconds for that

In 10 seconds

[Nice Peter (Rhett and Link):]
So you found yourself on a date with a beautiful girl
You try to tell her all the things that interest you in the world
Yeah, you talk about Harry Potter
She said she doesn't like wizards
You talk about your salamander
She said she doesn't like lizards
You try to stay quiet like it ain't no thing
But how long can you let that silence hang (10 seconds)
You stare into space (10 seconds)
Try not to focus on that errant hair on her face (10 seconds)
You think of something to say (10 seconds)
Just wait for the silence to go away

[Rhett, Link and Nice Peter:]
15 seconds of fame
And 5 seconds for that
[Nice Peter:] That protein shake on the locker room floor
[Link:] Gross.
Put those rules to shame
In 10 seconds

How long do you wait when you reset the internet router (10 seconds)

[Nice Peter (Rhett):]
How long do you wait before you give up on the hot water in the shower (10 seconds)

[Link (Rhett):]
When you drop some food on the ceiling (10 seconds)

[Nice Peter:]

[Nice Peter:]
D-d-decide this small, little pond is not suitable for boating

[Rhett, Link and Nice Peter:]
15 seconds of fame
And 5 seconds for that
[Rhett:] Trail mix literally on the trail
Put those rules to shame
In 10 seconds
10 seconds
