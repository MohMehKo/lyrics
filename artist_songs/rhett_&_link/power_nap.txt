A power nap gives you power
Give 20 minutes now
Get power for hours

You don't put on your pants before you put on your drawers
You don't wash your face after you wash your balls
You don't watch Phantom Menace before Empire Strikes Back
And you don't do important crap without taking a power nap

If you're gonna do important crap
Then you better take a power nap first
You wanna know where the power's at
It's in the middle of a power nap, word

You don't go seek before everybody hides
Or slide through a sliding door before you made it slide
You don't eat your grapes before you go through check out
I did that once and got banned from Ralph's

You don't read Stephen King before R.L. Stein
You don't pump the pump before the pump is primed
I don't slip on my mankini before my bikini wax
And I don't do important crap without taking a power nap

If you're gonna do important crap
Then you better take a power nap first
You wanna know where the power's at
It's in the middle of a power nap, word

You don't offer to pay before you've seen the check
You don't tattoo your face before you tattoo your neck
You don't send a text and then check the autocorrect
I once sent my mom a text that just said sex

You don't taste the honey before you smoke the bees
You don't get in the car before you cut the cheese
You don't talk to Santa before you sit on his lap
And you don't do important crap without taking a power nap

Power (power (power))
Power (power (power))
Power (power (power))
Power (power (power))
