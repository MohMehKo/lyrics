It's not you, it's me
And me don't like you
It's not you, it's I and
I am breaking up with you

You swore up and down the walls
That Twilight is is best trilogy of all
Some how you got me to agree
to dress up like Edward for Halloween (look what you did to him!)
And now that I'm coming clean
First off, Twilight's a quadrilogy
And that tan werewolf dude isn't worthy
Of removing,
A wookie's dingleberries

[Chewbacca impressions]

It's not me, it's you
(Even more I think about it) It's definitely you
But it might be me
Cause me decided to date you

When we went out on our first date
You said you don't eat anything with a face
Then for the next eighteen months
I ate sausage made from rice and walnuts (that's not sausage)
And now that we're parting ways
Newsflash, Fish have a face!
And unless it's in a newton, he doesn't want another fig!
Tonight I'm eating a rabbit-ven-it-ture-duck-in-ig

That's a rabbit inside a duck, inside a chicken, inside a turkey, inside a deer, inside a pig (deep fried), with gravy (beef gravy)

It's you, it's you (no doubt about it)
It was always totally you
But now it's up to me
And me is now dumping you
