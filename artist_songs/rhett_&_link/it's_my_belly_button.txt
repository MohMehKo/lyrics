I can't believe we've lived to be this old,
And somehow we have never seen this hole.
A little dent, with a little bit of lint, inside it;
Underneath this cotton tee, you've been hiding.
It's time that we unwrap this gift
Let's bring back the male midriff 

[Chorus:]
It's my belly button. My belly, belly button.
I won't pretend like its nothing,
'Cause my belly, belly button's really, really something.
Something I wanna show to you.

You should call me a seal, 'cause I'm going full naval.
I bedazzled it.
I made a nugget dip. Taste it!
Hold up. Fill the hole up with molten gold.
Mold a gold nugget for my charm bracelet.
Potting soil. Random seeds.
Douglas Fir. Sapling Maple Tree.
These are gonna get massive.
And absorb a lot of greenhouse gases.
The fact is, we're helping the planet's health.
Wait. We carbon offset ourselves.

So...

We can cruise around in a big SUV,
And these tree's allow us to ride separately.
Let's continue this conversation,
On our inefficient gas-powered phones.

Hey, I've got this business idea to drive our vehicles door to door selling my new invention:
It's a fully functional "Do-It-Yourself" miniature coal plant, exclusively for children.

[Chorus x2]

It's my belly button.
My belly belly button.
I won't pretend like it's nothing.
'Cause my belly belly button's really really something.
Something I want to show to you.

It's my belly button.
My belly belly button.
I won't pretend like it's nothing.
'Cause my belly, belly button's really, really something.
Something I want to show to you.
