We've got the greatest job on earth
And we're not even on earth
We're orbiting the world, you see
Collecting space debris
Expended rockets, expired satellites
Circling the globe, endangering space flight.
We're the guys cleaning up the mess
Putting astronauts family's fears to rest.

You wouldn't believe the premium on my life insurance policy
Even a paint chip would take off my arm travelling at orbital velocity

Collecting space junk, space waste, space stuff
We make it safe for shuttles to fly
We're trash men, weightless trash men!
Cleaning up the crap you left behind

We got hit by Soviet trash last year
From the cosmonauts on MIR
- but our worst memory was when we
We're sprayed by frozen pee
Here's some old bag of toiletries
What's in it? sunscreen and hydrocortisone cream
And the ashes of Gene Roddenberry
Ah! Tom Hanks script from Apollo 13!

You wouldn't believe the premium on my life insurance policy
Even a toenail would cut off my head travelling at orbital velocity

Collecting space junk, space waste, space stuff
Living the cosmic custodian life.
We're trash men, weightless trash men!
Scouring space...while trying not to die!
