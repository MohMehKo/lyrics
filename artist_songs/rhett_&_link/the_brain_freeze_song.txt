So you've saved a little room for dessert (yeah)
Not really but a little dessert won't hurt (nah)
But wouldn't you know a bogo promo (oh)
On double mint chocolate chip cookie dough (oh)
Before your mom pulls the car around (yeah)
You already popped the lid and scarfed it down (mmm)
Pace yourself, brother
Your mouth's writing checks that it's roof can't cover

You're gonna get an ice cream headache ow
You're gonna freeze your brain
No way to ease the pain
You're gonna have to wait it out
You've got a ice cream headache now
You're the one to blame
So you can't complain
You ate it like a Grizzly downin' a rainbow trout
He's really riving it on that trout

You look like you've been kicked in the balls (oaahh)
But that ain't happening at all (nah)
Let me simplify things for ya
You see your Trigeminal Nerve is causing sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia.

A.K.A. an ice cream headache ow
You're gonna freeze your brain
No way to ease the pain
You're gonna have to wait it out
You've got a ice cream headache now
You're the one to blame
So you can't complain
You ate it like a screech owl pecking the life out of a mouse
Like a pack of dingos tearing up a dairy cow
I bet you wish you were lactose intolerant now
