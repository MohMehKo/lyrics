You get some green sweats
I get some red sweats
Then we switch 'em up
We got Christmas sweats

You get some red sweats
I get some green sweats
Then we switch 'em up
We got Christmas sweats

She's got a green sweatshirt
(Yeah)
And got some green sweatpants
(They match)
That's just a green sweatsuit
You see that every other motherfruitcaking day

He's got a red sweatshirt
(Boring)
And got some red sweatpants
(Yawn)
That's just a red sweatsuit
You see that every other motherfruitcaking day

You get some green sweats
I get some red sweats
Then we switch 'em up
We got Christmas sweats

You get some red sweats
I get some green sweats
Then we switch 'em up
We got Christmas sweats

He's so festive
He's gonna get himself arrested

She's probably a pro sleigh rider
I bet she pees apple cider

He's probably done all his shopping
I bet he actually wears Christmas stockings

Is she texting Santa?
He's spending time with Amanda
(Who's Amanda?)
(His stepdaughter, he's in a second marriage, it's cool)

You get some green sweats
I get some red sweats
Then we switch 'em up
We got Christmas sweats
(Yeah! What? Woah...)

You get some blue sweats
I get some white sweats
Then we switch 'em up
We got Hanukkah sweats

You get some red sweats
I get some green sweats
He gets some black sweats
Kwanzaa sweats

You get some red sweats
I get some green sweats
Then we switch 'em up
We got Christmas sweats
