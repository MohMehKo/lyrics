[Rhett & Link:]
Since the dawn of man people have swam without shirts or pants wherever they can
And some dare to be are more audacious and spare underwear baring private places
Skinny dipping might be fun for some
But I'm on the hunt for something never been done
In history...
Why are we whispering?
If we start like this; we can increase intensity

Man, I got a deep desire to swim while in my full attire
For real! I feel its time for soaking
Me, myself, and my clothing!
I want to float in a coat;
Get doused in a blouse;
Snorkel in a cardigan!
Backstroke in a cloak;
Aquaboogie in a hoodie;
Dress up
Dive in
Its phatdippin'!

[Iman Crosson:]
(Phatdippin'!)
My fellow Americans, let me be clear
(Phatdippin'!)
I mandate phatdippin' this year
(Phatdippin'!)
The country's in the tank, I'm just being real
(Phatdippin'!)
Is it too late to add this to the stimulus bill?

[Rhett & Link:]
If you a first-time phatdipper, by all means ease in with your sneakers, tee shirt, and jeans
For the more advanced, go on, take a chance. Wear a big poofy coat and sweatpants
Our advice is, check a checklist: remove your wallet and your electronic devices
Don't void your warranty. Put your phone in a baggie; hand your wallet to me
Your cellulite - (won't see the light)
Got a farmers tan? - (still a ladies man)
Got back-ne? - (what's backne?)
Back acne - (ew, nasty)
All the ladies may be pitching a fit... but on the inside they sayin', "I love to phatdip!"

[Tay Zonday:]
Underwater with my clothes on
Feels so right it can't be wrong
I got a soggy sensation saturating me
I'm pretty sure phatdippin's gonna bring world peace

[Iman Crosson:]
(Phatdippin'!)
This phatdippin' craze gives me the urge
(Phatdippin'!)
To address the public while fully submerged
(Phatdippin'!)
I hearby issue an executive order
(Phatdippin'!)
Put on your clothes and jump in the water

(Phatdippin!) [x4]
