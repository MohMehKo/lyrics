I've been on this John for way too long playing Candy Crush
But before my legs fall completely asleep I'd better finish up and flush
So without even looking I reach over to grab a few TP squares
But to my utter horror there ain't no more squares there
I wonder if it would hurt if I used the cardboard paper roll
I'm pretty sure it's do the job, but would it make it down the bowl?
And maybe the toilet brush could work, but those bristles look a little scary
And what about that embroided towel I got when I got married (she would never forgive me)

So I'm gon' let it dry
Just let it be
Gonna let it dry-y-y
Like I'm a dog on a leash
And I'm gonna let it dry
Air it out in the breeze
I'm gonna let it dry-y-y
Like I'm a chimpanzee

I see a curling iron and some matches
But I can't find cotton balls
There's nail clippers and a plunger and a poster of Lionel Richie on the wall (he would never forgive me)

So I'm gon' let it dry
Nobody has to know
Gonna let it dry-y-y
Like I'm a buffalo
I'm gonna let it dry
Like a bird in flight
Gonna let it dry-y-y
I'll take a shower tonight

I'm gonna let it dry
I'll take a shower tonight
I'm gonna let it dry
I'll take a shower tonight
