[Rhett:]
This is my exercise bike
It's got a lot of features that I like
Like a seat
And pedals for my feet
And handlebars for me to hold onto

[Link:] (That's all pretty standard.)

[Rhett:]
This is my exercise bike
You ought'a see just how fast I ride
Look at me
Going faster than the speed
Of a pregnant cheetah

[Link:] (How pregnant?)
[Rhett:]
(Half pregnant.)

It's like I'm riding in the Tour De France
[Link:] But in his mind that's what he means
[Rhett:] Don't need no drugs to boost my performance
[Link:] Just test his pee you'll see he's clean
[Rhett:] Got to the top, totally on my own
[Link:] He's a man of his word
[Rhett:] No that's not a syringe of human growth hormone
[Link:] It's happy gerbil herbs

[Rhett:]
(Herbs)

This is just my exercise bike
The resistance goes from low to high
And when it's high
It makes it seem like I
Am going up an incline

[Link:] (Well, yeah, that's generally how they work.)

[Rhett:] You need to stop it with your accusing
[Link:] He's just a natural athlete
[Rhett:] No I'm not getting a blood transfusion
[Link:] It's just a bag of pudding
[Rhett:] And look at this ball, it's not deflated at all
[Link:] Plus it's irrelevant to this conversation
[Rhett:]
And no I didn't send my cousin to the
Congo to extract the DNA of a gorilla
And then formulate it into a sports drink which I personally endorse
[Link:]
It's called Gorillagy

This is just my exercise bike
