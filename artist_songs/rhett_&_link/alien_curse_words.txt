[Rhett and Link:] Sometimes things happen to me, that make me want to curse. Like when I accidentally forget, where I left my manpurse.
[Link:] Not that I have a manpurse.
[Rhett:] But I would prefer not to offend fellow humans 'cos I am one!
[Rhett and Link:] If there was only cursing terminology that seemed appropriate in all situations....
[DeStorm:] Hey guys, guess what?
[Rhett and Link:] What?
[Destorm:] Yo, I landed on a planet that we used to call Pluto. These aliens attacked. I could'a sworn they known judo! I made it out alive with a gift to humanity. To my surprise it was a satchel of profanities! Peep gang. It was words like;
[Rhett and Link:] Boomshkie
[Destorm:] They said that.
[Rhett and Link:] Snigglesnoorp, SwaqQ@ffufle, Imz#w, Zilkr*k, Glep**$h, D@rt@f#$
[Destorm:] So offensive!
[Rhett and Link:] Dubopshazinski
[Destorm:] Wow.
[Rhett and Link:] Frozen cherries, Flin9p00p, W@fl@nk, DeRbrAgEl, Blarfelnoggle!
[Destorm:] And then they had the nerve to say,
[Rhett and Link:] Fl#rplest#mpkin!
[Destorm:] So I call NASA and I get outta there! Yup.
