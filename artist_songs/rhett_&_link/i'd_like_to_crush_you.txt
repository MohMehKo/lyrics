I've crushed cans and I've crushed gravel. 
And I crushed grandma's leg in the door of a Cadillac
(she walks with a limp but she learned her lesson). 
Now I'm crushin' on you babe like the grainy innards of a store bought hacky sack
(you know how a hacky sack has that ksh ksh ksh in it?).
I drunk a beverage with crushed ice and it was nice. 
But not nearly as nice as what one night with you might be like. 

I'd like to crush you under the weight of my love. 
Brushing up against you is like touching an electric dove. 

I've crushed dirt clots with my boots. 
And boxes after I've moved.
But what I wouldn't do for a 30 second convo with you. 

I'd show you my collection of civil war prosthetics. 
And tell you a secret and never regret it like I've got a sub-dermal arm that the doctors can't explain
(I think you might regret that). 

I'd take you hand and place it in mine, not the sub-dermal one but the one outside
and then give you a manicure and grab the other hand and start the process over again. 

I'd like to crush you under the weight of my love. 
Brushing up against you is like touching an electric dove.
And I'd like to bulldoze the barriers between your heart and mine. 
I'd like to backhoe a ditch and call the gas company ahead of time
(and by call the gas company, I mean call you).

What's your number? 

(You can put it in my cellular telephone.)
