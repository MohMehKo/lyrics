For the past 18 years;
You're life's been pretty smooth;
Let's take a moment and reflect;
On all you've had to do.

You've rolled out of bed;
And strolled to the living room;
And watched Cartoon Network;
While your mom made waffles for you.

Your laundry
Was magically clean;
And your dad's back pocket
Was an ATM machine.

Your life's biggest worry
Was what to wear to the prom;
And your only regret was that incident;
With the stink bomb.

Do you hear that subtle sound?
It's the sound of reality about the slap to taste out your mouth!

Now you're on your own.
You should be scared.
But we can tell;
You don't care. (Why don't you care? You should be frightened.)

You're young and now you're free.
The world is your oyster.
We have no clue what that means;
But let us paint a picture of your future.

You're gonna eat a lot of Hot Pockets;
And you're thinking that sounds great.
Well, get back to us in 6 months
When you've had 378.

As soon as you move out;
You know what you're parent are gonna do?
There gonna turn your bedroom into an exercise room;
That they never use.

And you won't use lockers in college.
And this might be a total bummer.
There are no yearbooks either, you'll actually have to say
Have a great summer!

Do you feel that gentle breeze?
It's the Category 5 hurricane of adulthood about to hit you upside the head with a tree!

Now you're on your own.
Don't screw this up.
You're on your own;
Good luck. (You're gonna need it.)
