I hear the train a comin', it's rolling round the bend
I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone.

When I was just a baby my mama told me:
Son, always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing I hang my head and cried

Some of you may know Link, I consider him a friend 
But I ain't seen that old boy since I don't know when
I'm stuck here in this basement working all alone
While Link's tends to his woman and children at home

But I'm gonna hold down the fort
I'm gonna thrive in this arrangement
I'm gonna carry the firey torch of internetainment
I'm gonna keep on going even though it's just me
I'm keep on going cause I'm a mythical beast

I said I'm gonna keep on going cause I'm a mythical beast
