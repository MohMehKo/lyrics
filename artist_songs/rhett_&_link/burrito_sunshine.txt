The filling inside gives me a feeling inside

I think I could really go for a burrito
Yeah, I think that would be neat-o
There's a place not too far
Heard it's got four and a half stars
On Yelp?
No, on my Uncle Roger's blog
He's a food blogger?
Yeah, you haven't heard?
My Uncle Roger's a food blogger

If I could just find my left shoe we'd be on our way
But apparently my left shoe has been misplaced
No, it's right here
(It's your right shoe, whatever)

Look at us walkin' with two shoes on each
I never knew two shoes could make my feet feel so complete, ah
(Here we are at the highly-rated restaurant, wearing shoes)

Through the pick-up window
Emerges my burrito
Four food groups, one tortilla
Coming together like reverse Pangea

Now I'm basking in burrito sunshine
(I'm basking in the beams of light)
Just relaxing in burrito sunshine
(My throat's a burrito waterslide)

The filling inside gives me a feeling inside [x4]

Burrito sunshine

(It's as if I've just eaten a brick)
