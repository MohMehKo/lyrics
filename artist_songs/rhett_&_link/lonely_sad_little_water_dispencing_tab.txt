I'm always here for you
In the middle of this mess
I'm always here to quench your thirst
It's not my fault
That when I'm pressed
A little juice comes out first

It's just so embarrassing
You standing right there, staring right through me
All I want is for you to use me
I may be free but I'm not cheap

Hanging here beneath the lemonade label
Nobody notices me
No colorful logo
No fizzy flow
In the soft drink machine
Got it pretty bad
I'm a lonely sad
Little water dispensing tab

I'm a little guy
With insecurities
I ain't got what them other guys give
But what I lack in pazazz
I make up in purity
Just touch me and we'll live
We'll live

It's just so embarrassing
I see your Minute Maid looking down on me
Carbonation's overrated
And baby, I'm giving you no calories

Hanging here beneath the lemonade label
Not very prominent
Who knew I'd falter
When bottled water
Became so dominant
Got it pretty bad
I'm a lonely sad
Little water dispensing tab

Got it pretty bad
I'm a lonely sad
Little water dispensing tab
