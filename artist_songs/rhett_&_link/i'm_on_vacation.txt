Everything's okay
'Cause I'm on vacation
We spent 14 hours on that sandcastle!
Everything is great
'Cause I'm on vacation
At least we're not back at our jobs
Which is at an ice cream sandwich factory

We need it
We want it
Vacation
We on it
Surf, beach, palm trees, got, no worries
Typically I ride a bike by myself but I'm on vacation
I'm gonna ride with someone else
Yeah
We rented a double bike
Two men on a double bike,
I've always wondered what a double bike ride feels like
I think there's something in my eye
But it's okay
'Cause I'm still on vacation
I left my fashion sense at home
It's time to get our airbrush t-shirt on!
I'm willing to pay anything he wants me to pay
'Cause he can make a shirt say anything I want it to say
Birthday Girl

I love Dolphins
Teen Mom
Dog Person
Steve Jobs
Uh, you got a little something on your face
(I know)

But it's still okay
'Cause I'm on vacation
I think he misspelled the word vacation but that's cool
Everything is great
'Cause I'm on vacation
Making ice cream sandwiches isn't as fun as it sounds
It's cold up in here
And every ice cream sandwich has to be perfect
That one's upside-down

On vacay I spend cake on figurines and keepsakes
This decorative plate (I'ma use that)
This sand dollar (I need that)
This snow globe (I'ma use that)
This ink pen (did you see that?)
I can't see at all
But I'm still on vacation
I don't eat fudge much, in my daily routine
But on vacation I judge fudge and become a fudge fiend
I think I love fudge
I think I'm feeling queasy
I think this fudge has been drugged
Who would do such a thing?
(me)

[Spoken:]
Turns out these ladies are really running this boutique as a front for an identity theft ring, and now they're dragging our limp bodies straight up out this lobby into the back where they're gonna steal everything

But it's still okay
'Cause I'm on vacation
Right now they're applying for a car loan as us (good for them)
Everything is great
'Cause I'm on vacation
Our boss is very demanding
We only get like a 15 minute lunch break
And all we get to eat is ice cream sandwiches

No cash
No phone
No obvious way to get home
It's time to turn to the only skill that we can fall back on
Selling ice cream sandwiches at the corner of this street
Twelve dollars for a dozen or fifty cents a piece
Don't question where we got the ice cream from
Just step right up and sample some
Cookies, the nicest
Ice cream the whitest
But I think what's inside this is a mutated virus
We might have just unleashed a zombie apocalypse

But it's still okay
'Cause I'm on vacation
Everything is great
'Cause I'm on vacation
How did zombies get in here? This is a flashback scene
(And why are they even in this music video at all?)
(This is so cliche)
Well, technically these are time traveling zombies, which is slightly more original

Everything is great
'Cause I'm on vacation
(Hey!)
(HEY!)
(Stupid and dummy)
(Your vacation was not approved, and you're both fired!)
Permanent vacation!
