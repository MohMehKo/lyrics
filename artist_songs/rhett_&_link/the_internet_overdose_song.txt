Oh I remember a time when life was so much simpler and not so quick way back in the year 2006.
Never heard of RSSes. My hands were full with two email addresses and a myspace page; lying about my income and age.

I also had a blog about remote control cars - roboblog.blogspot.com. I updated multiple times...a year.

And just when I thought I had it all figured out, my little brother started a video blog.
I refuse to be left here in the digital dust. I'm socially networking my way back on top!

Follow me, poke me, feed me! I'll stumble upon you, digg you freely!
Take a dip in my photostream! The "e" in Flickr was given to me like the key to an internet city of which I am king (or mayor). Or moron.

I'm laughin in your face if you just joined Facebook today. It's so "last year." Even my boss has "weekend" pics on there.
Weekend pics? Yeah, like casual pics - in his hottub. Did he tag himself?

And now I can't remember what life was like before I Twittered. I can't resist telling the world I just found a cyst.
Oh man, you think it's serious? If it is, I'll let you know in 140 characters or less.

Lately I've been signing up on so many sites I've had to hire a fulltime password guy.
You can watch him day-or-night on my live stream. It's the cutting-edge opposite of interesting!

Google me, plurk me, feed me! Deliciously linked-in, pwn you neatly!

You're so leet. You're a loser noob. You're an uber lame king. I'll pwn you as king.
