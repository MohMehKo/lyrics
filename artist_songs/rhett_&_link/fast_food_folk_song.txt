Iʼll start with a taco, soft like a cloud
I want mine crunchy, I like to eat loud
Iʼll choose a chalupa, Iʼll grab a gordita
And two taco salads for our senoritas
And a Burrito Supreme, with extra sour cream
Itʼs a cylindrically shaped seasoned beef dream
A taquito. An enchirito. Some cinnamon twists
A chicken border bowl. Are you gettinʼ all this?

And you know that nothing beats a
Hmmm, mmmm...Mexican Pizza...
Weʼll take two of those, but please hold the diced tomatoes
And I admit, Iʼve always felt
Like Iʼm in love with the meximelt
Make mine with a little extra love, and think of me...
As the cheese drops from your Taco Bell glove
And thatʼs it

No no no! that's not it ...Iʼll also take a...

Double-decker taco cause Iʼm feeling wild
And make my sauce Fire. Uh, heʼll take mild
And weʼll take two Mt. Dew Baja blasts
For a chance at 25 dollars cash
Iʼm told thereʼs a winner for every 5 minutes
Iʼm stealing your online code if you win it
Why would you do that? You owe me 25 bones
I owe you 5. Plus interest--it was a loan
And I think weʼll be satisﬁed, if we get some mexican rice on the side
And thatʼs it
