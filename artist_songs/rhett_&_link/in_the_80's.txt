You kids think - your gear is iconic
But I'm 'gon take you back to see some real electronics
Gimme a beige PC, green text, black screen and 64KB of memory (That's plenty!)
Forget a phone that fits in your pocket
I keep a phone in a bag in my car (That's how we rock it!)
Who needs a camcorder, the size of my hand?!
You know I want to look like a news cameraman! (I wanna perch it on my shoulder.. like an overweight parrot!)

My disks were floppy but my hair was stiff, and all my stickers were scratch and sniff!

In the 80's! If it was big is was good!
80's! My TV was wood!
80's! My car was shaped like a box!
80's! Back when everything rocked!

Your telling me mp3s, oh they're so great 
I'd rather push rewind; and sit and wait!
My first VCR cost me five grand 
VHS is the best! (I'm a BETA man!)

16-button controllers really make me sick! Give me one red button and a joystick!

In the 80's! The bigger the better
80's! I had an antenna!
80's! My TV was thick!
80's! We didn't point and click!
80's! I had a big boom box!
80's! I calculated with my watch!
80's! My mix tapes were hot!                 
80's! Back when everything rocked!
