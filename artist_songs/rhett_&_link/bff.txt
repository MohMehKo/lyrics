What if you get buried alive?
Who's gon' dig you out from the ground?
What if you choke on some pie?
Who is gonna squeeze it back out?

What if you've got one hand in a garbage disposal
And your other hand switches it on?
Whose third hand is gonna pull your first hand out
While their fourth hand turns the switch back off?

What if you stick a cotton swab
Too far into your ear?
And it becomes lodged into the side of your brain?

And you severely damage your inferior temporal gyrus?
Which is the part of the brain that helps you process shapes
Who's gonna sit with you and help you relearn your shapes
So you don't seem like a complete idiot?

I was down on my luck
At the end of my rope
About to give up
But my friend said nope
I'm here for you
I'm there for you
And I'll do anything
That you need me to
If you were in a wreck
And needed a spine
I'd cut myself open
And give you mine
But then you'd never again
Be able to stand
I'll happily live my life
As a jellyman
If I found out you had
One parasitic twin
I'd make that twin
My second best friend
I'm sure he'd be
An excellent guy
I don't care if he was just
Some teeth and an eye
