How did we get ourselves into this situation
Bitterly divided over wheel orientation

You look like you stepped into glue
And then stepped on some toddler's skateboards
But at least you're not a toddler
'Cause they annoy me a lot more
And you look like a rejected extra
From that movie Battlefield Earth
But at least you're not a Scientologist
'Cause man, they are the worst
Yeah

Sure there are some differences between you and me
You're not as cool as me
But we share something that makes us unique

We got wheels
That makes us better
Why judge each other
When we can judge everybody else together?
We got wheels
That's how we roll
And everyone else
Is a butthole
People without wheels are buttholes

We shouldn't waste our lives
Living as roller discriminators
When I think we can both agree
That we absolutely hate ice skaters
Look at them with their frilly clothes
And their skates that will not roll
We should herd them into ice skating camps
And never let them go

Sure, compared to me you are inferior
But compared to the rest of the world we are superior

We got wheels
That makes us better
Why judge each other
When we can judge everybody else together?
We got wheels
That's how we roll
And everyone else
Is a butthole
People without wheels are buttholes
People without wheels are buttholes
