There's a time, of which none speak
A secret time lost in the briny deep

You know all about:
Half time, big time
Break time, lunch time, dinner dinner time
Tee time, free time, me time, the time
You'd undo if you could travel in time
Space time, face time, hard time, Hammer time
In the meantime, Miller time
Daytime, snack time, nap time, night time
Bath time, bed time, business time

But don't forget about

[Chorus:]
Nilla Wafer Top Hat Time
It's the time you wear a hat
Made out of Nilla Wafers
Nilla Wafer Top Hat Time
It's the best time
In the history of mankind

One day
There was a knock at my door
A mysterious drifter
Was on the other side
In his hands, was a box
And on his lips were the words:
"Listen closely, I don't have much time."

Then he reached in the box and pulled out
A Nilla Wafer top hat, from inside
He said "Wear it, when its time,"
And I said, "What time?"
And then he died

Later I realized he was talking about

[Chorus]

Nilla wafer Top Hat Time
Nilla wafer Top Hat Time
Nilla wafer Top Hat Time
Nilla wafer Top Hat Time
Nilla wafer Top Hat Time
Nilla wafer Top Hat Time
