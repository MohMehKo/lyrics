Everyone knows what a hamster does
(Or do you?)
They stuff their little cheeks with their food pellets
(And then poo poo)
They drink from their water bottle thing over there
(And they love it)
They run in circles in a wheel that goes nowhere
(Or does it?)

Hamsters, they got something to hide
Hamsters, they got that secret life
(let's take a peek inside)

Their wheels keep the earth rotating on its axis
Auditing University of Phoenix classes
They do it for the knowledge, not the credit
Trollin' the trolls who troll trolls on reddit

Reading all that newspaper lining their cage
Caught up on the world's events a few days late
Building tiny cities underneath that mulch
Where they brainwash guinea pigs to join their cult

Hamsters, they got something to hide
Hamsters, they got that secret life

Trading sub-par corn on the corn black market
Moving your car so you think you forgot where you parked it
Playing Call of Tiny Duty on a PlayStation
It's preparation for their tiny invasion

Plotting their escape while enjoying origami
Flashing hand signals for the Hamster-minati
Jaywalking and robbing graves
I'm sure they have pure motives, we just can't understand their ways

Hamsters, they got something to hide
Hamsters, they got that secret life
Hamsters, every time you look away
Hamsters, more than meets the cage

(What does it mean?)
(I don't know)
(Its like 'More than meets the eye' but its a cage)
(Wow so smart)
(Maybe not though)
