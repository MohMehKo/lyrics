[Rhett:] I've mastered the art of mental manipulation
Workin' every muscle group through meditation
This is me workin' out my triceps
Pick up my DVD called "Mind Reps."

See this turtleneck, with a necklace? You'll be wearing this next year

[Rhett:] Is that all you got?
[Link:] No

[Link:] I see buttons, I just push 'em to see what they do
If something were to go wrong I'd just blame it on you

[Rhett:] I'm quick-witted, I always know just what to say
[Link:] Then say something clever
[Rhett:] Uh, ok
