A 5, 6, 7, 8
It's time to go
It's time to go, go, go
But before we go,
I got to know
If I got everything
before I go out the door

Cars need keys
Not cheese
Just keys
Get the keys, please
Not the cheese
Geez!

My back pocket is there
But the pocket is bare
What goes in there?
My wallet!

Get the wallet
There, I got it
Put the wallet
In my pocket
Over my derriere

Where's my cell phone?
I bet it's in my hand
Yup

My lips are dry,
But I gotta stay calm
Get my lippity, lippity, lippity, lippity, lip,
Lip balm

Is the oven on? (Nope!)
Did I zip my fly? (Yup!)
Did I properly affix a band-aid to my third nipple because it gets exceptionally hard and looks awkward?
Check!

Got my stuff
Got it on
Let's go
Time to go
Out the door
Now I'm gone
Goodbye
See ya later
Sayonara
Hasta la vista
