Hello, Mr.Neal, how are you today?
(I'm good. Wheres the rest of the group?)
Oh, it's just you
(I'm the group?)
Yes, but that's all I need

That picture frame
Those hoodie strings
(They are driving me insane)
Unequal pizza slices
Fonts of different sizes
(It's more than I can take)
Missing parentheses
Uneven capris
Googling "askew"
Bags opened from the wrong end
Should be recognized as a sin,
Along with an unsolved Rubik's Cube

I gotta make things right
Make it the way it's supposed to be
It's my OCD

[Rhett (with Link):]
Toilet paper facing inwards
Unsynchronized synchronized swimmers
A closet that's not organized
Pills removed out of sequence
Sideburns that are not even
That one rebel mini blind

Make it the way it's supposed to be

[Rhett (Link):]
Mr.Neal, how's everything going?
(Fine)
Would you like to take a break?
(Yeah, actually that'd be greâ€”)
Great. I hope you're hungry.
I've prepared some snacks for you.
Enjoy

All right, we're all done. You're free to go.
Mr.Neal?
Mr.Neal?
(Can I come back tomorrow?)
