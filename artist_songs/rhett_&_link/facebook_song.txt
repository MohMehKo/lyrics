[Rhett and Link:]
I wouldn't call myself a social butterfly
And there's not much that separates me from the other guy
But when I login I begin to live
There's an online world where I am king
Of a little website dedicated to me
With pictures of me and a list of my friends
And an unofficial record of the groups that I'm in
Before the internet friendship was so tough
You actually had to be in peoples presence and stuff
Who would've thought that with a point and a click
I could know that Hope Floats is your favorite flick (Harry Connick Jr.?)

[Hook:]
Facebook (Facebook)
I'm Hooked on Facebook
I used to meet girls hanging out at the mall, now I just wait for them to write on my wall
Its more than a want, it's more than a need
I'd shrivel up and die without my mini-feed
Take a look (You're Hooked) on Facebook

[Rhett:]
Oh Link's status changed
It says he's playing the recorder

[Rhett and Link:]
How do you know this person?
Did you hook up with this person?
Do you need to request confirmation?
Or did you just think they looked cute from their picture on Facebook?
If the internet crashed all across the land
Or my Facebook account was deleted by the man
I'd carry around a picture of my face
And a summary of me typed out on a page
