Back in late 2008
The thing that was all the rage...
Millions of you watched Shiba Inu puppies didn't you?
Live, 24 hours a day
They eat sleep bark poopoo and play.
But now those puppies are dogs
And it's just not the same at all.
So what do you want?...
The next time you hop online
If we could only read your mind
We'd crack the code to live viral video.
But you don't even know what you want until you see it.
So we will conceive it and convince you that you need it.
Please remain seated 'til the procedure is completed.

Live on the internet. And you can't get enough of it!

Even though we've mapped the human genome
We still can't predict the next live web phenom.
We know so much, we've come so far...
But when it comes to this we're still in the dark.
I feel like a baby; a small helpless baby...
A small helpless baby trying to make gravy...
A Peruvian Llama trying to put on pajamas...
A two-toed sloth trying to play golf.

Live on the Internet. And you can't get enough of it!
