When smoke pours from my mouth 
I feel like a dragon
Or like Gandalf 
Blowing magic rings 
With his best friend Bilbo Baggins 
Or James Dean in his white T-shirt 
With smokes rolled in his sleeve
Or my granddad puffing in those polaroids 
And he looked just like me
But cooler than me, 'cause he was smoking 
But he's dead
And so is James Dean
And sure James Dean died in a car wreck
but I bet a cigarette caused the accident 
And Bilbo and Gandalf never existed 
But if they did now they would be dead
But dragons
They do exist
And they have special lungs that resist 
The carcinogenic effects of smoke 
But I don't
So I'm not gonna smoke

'Cause I'm a person, not a dragon. 
Rest in peace Bilbo Baggins
