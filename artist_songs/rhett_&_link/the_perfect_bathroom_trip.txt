We live in a world full of dirty things
Dirty doorknobs and ATM machines
Dirty cooks sneezing on my chicken wings
So much dirty disease, we can't keep our hands clean
Public restrooms are a main concern
Where the walls are painted with stranger's germs
If they scribble on the wall of a bathroom stall
Do you honestly think they wash their hands after touching there

All I'm making is a simple suggestion
To have an exit plan next time you enter a restroom
I'm not concerned with your particular reason
Be it OCD, or just the upcoming cold and flu season
Listen here

Do your business
Zip up and then dispense this
Little bit of paper towel but wait
Turn on the tap apply some soap
Lather up, rinse, don't stop the flow
First grab that paper towel you saved
Use it as a barrier
When touching the faucet area
Then get more paper towels for your hands
Dry with it, then retain it
For the doorknob may be tainted
As you exit, bank it off the wall into the trashcan
It's the perfect bathroom trip
It's the perfect bathroom plan
