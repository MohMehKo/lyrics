If I had another me

Think of all the wonderful things
Us two could do as we
Like a perfectly matched
Arm wrestling match
That ends with us falling asleep

I'd hang out with him just to see
How annoying I could be
Or look at parts of my body
That I've never really seen

If I had another me
If us had another we
There's no doubt that our lives would be
At least two times more amazing

But I'd probably start to hate the way
His voice sounds after time
And he'd likely use his DNA
To frame me for a crime

Maybe having another me
Isn't all I thought it'd be
I think I'll eventually have to murder me

There can only be one me
There shouldn't be another we
Or I would dismember me
And bury me under a tree
If I had another me
