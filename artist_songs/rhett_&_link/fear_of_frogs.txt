I am extremely suspicious of any creature so slimy
It traverses the ground yet escapes under water.
They lure you in close with their cute little croaks
And their shimmering skin on exhibit.
But make no mistake, amphibians translate the phrase
"Die, human" as "Ribbit"!

God could have chosen any ten things for the Plagues.
The fact that he included frogs must mean something.
There’s only one thing more frightening that I’ve cataloged
And that’s a person who stands unafraid in the face of a frog!
