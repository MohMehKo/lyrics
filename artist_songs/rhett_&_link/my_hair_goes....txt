My hair goes up
My hair goes down
My hair goes up
My hair goes down
My hair goes up
My hair goes down (up)
Down (Up) Down (Up) Down (Up) Down (Up)

My hair flows like a waterfall
Over a cliff that is my face
My hair goes heaven-bound
Dirty blonde rockets into space

Mmmm-My hair conceals my elf ears
They are a little bit embarrassing
Well with hair this high, I'm 6 foot 9
Making me a giant technically speaking

Well, I can shake my hair and generate enough breeze
To locomote a toy sailboat
I would need no broom to sweep this room
If someone spilled Honey Bunches of Oats

'Cause my hair goes up
My hair goes down
My hair goes up
My hair goes down
My hair goes up
My hair goes down (up)
Down (Up) Down (Up) Down (Up) Down (Up)

My hair owns gravity
It makes Sir Isaac Newton question himself
My hair looks rustic
Like I've draped my head with a beaver pelt

Mmmma mama bird laid some eggs up there
I didn't mind that much
She raised 'em in my quaff 'til them birdies flew off
And we still keep in touch

I bet you didn't see my switch blade
Or my iPad, or my chai tea
And with a little more growth, you won't even know
I've got a full-sized baby (full-sized baby)

Yeah, I'm gonna name him Ricky

"After your dad!"
"Nope!"

I just always wanted to name a kid Ricky
I would call him Richard, but I'm probably bein' picky

And why're you hidin' a kid anyway?
Well it's actually just a robotic baby

"What were we talking about?"

Your hair goes up
Your hair goes down
Your hair goes up
Your hair goes-

"We interrupt the chorus of this song to bring you an important message."
"There are many weighty decisions you must make in life."
"Like, who you're gonna marry."
"What you're gonna do for a living."
"Boxers or briefs."
"Or commando."

"And listen, you're gonna make mistakes."
"You might invest your life savings in dehydrated water."
"You might forget whether prohibited means you can do it or you can't do it."
"You might ask a non-pregnant woman if she's pregnant."
"That's okay, you'll recover."

"But just make sure you get this-
"ONE MOST IMPORTANT, COURSE OF YOUR LIFE ALTERING CHOICE, RIGHT."

[Man:] Can I have my baby back now? [Link:] Yeah.

Does your hair go up?
Or does it go down (up)
Down (Up) Down (Up) Down (Up) Down (Up)
