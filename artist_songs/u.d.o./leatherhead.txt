Well, I’m From The Streets
I Come From The Wrong Side

I’ll Kick Out Your Daylight
That’s Gonna Be Fun
I’m A Twenty-Four Carat
I’m A Son Of A Gun

I Am The Leatherhead – Leatherhead
I Am Aflame – Leatherhead
Leatherhead – That’s My Name – Leatherhead
Don’t Be Making Waves Or I’m Gonna Cut You Down

I Am The Leatherhead – Leatherhead
I Am Aflame – Leatherhead
Leatherhead – That’s My Name
I Am The Leatherhead – Leatherhead
I Am On Fire – Leatherhead

Don’t You Gimme Lip And Don’t You Make A Sound
