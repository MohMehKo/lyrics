Electric And Dissected
I’m Taking It All On
Fulfilling All Your Wishes
The Gaming Has Begun

Dismembered And Remembered
The Winner He Will Fall
You’ve Got Just What You’ve Asked For
You’re Under My Control

I Am The Man Who Is Eager To Take You Apart
I Am The One Who Will Send You To Hell And Beyond

Pain Man – Writing All The Rules
Pain Man – Will Not Suffer Fools
Pain Man – Alive And Demonized
Pain Man – Sharp And Razor Like

Directed And Suspected
The Common Tools Of Trade
Forsaken And Mistaken
Decisions Have Been Made

Draining And Debraining
You’re Choosing Up The Mode
Confess You Really Like It
You’ll Like The Overload
