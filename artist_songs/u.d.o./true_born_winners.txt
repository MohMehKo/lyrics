We Gotta Drink Some More
Until We Hit The Floor
We’re Gonna Go Rocking Wild

We’re Gonna Blitz This Town
With Our Heavy Sounds
We’ll Have A Crazy Time Tonight

What Do You Want – Wanna Spend Your Cash
Spend Your Night In A Headlong Crash

Raise ‘Em High For The True Born Winners
Here We Stand And Here We Fall
Raise It Up For The Midnight Sinners
All For One And Another For All

We’re Gonna Stare You Down
We Are The Loud And Proud
We’re Gonna Sow The Seeds Tonight

We’re Gonna Roll And Ride
We’ll Blow Your Underside
We Got Our Heads Up For The Fight

Crazy Nights And Red Light Warnings
Tough And Rough On Hazy Mornings
