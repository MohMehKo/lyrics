Living With The Pack
Never On The Rack
I’m Higher Than An Eagle In The Sky

Lightning On My Back
The Sky Is Turning Black
I’m Burning With The Fire That Collides

And When My Time Is Over There Is No Return For Me
You’ll Find Me In The Elements – And Finally I’m Free

Stormbreaker – Stormbreaker
I’m Running With The Forces Of The Night
Stormbreaker – Stormbreaker
I’m Rolling With The Thunder And The Light

Better You Beware
There’s Static In The Air
There’s Nothing That Will Stop The Flow Of Fear

Fear Becoming Storm
Hail And Rain Below
The Centre Of The Eye Is Rushing Near
