When I Was A Child
The Whole World Looked So Wild
Oh Oh – So Wild
Then I Was A Boy
And Discovered New Toys
Oh Oh – The Joy

Wanna Get It Out – Gotta Get It Out
This Is My Tale – These Were The Times Of My Life
Running With The Pack – Never Turning Back
Thanks To You All – Won’t Get ’Em Out Of My Mind

The Days Of Hope And Glory
And Nights Of Solitude
Don’t Ask Me What’s The Story
There’s Nothing There For You

Then I Was A Youth
On The Hunt For The Truth
Oh So Uncouth
Adrift On A Blue Ocean
So Far And So Wide
Far Far And Wide

Now I Am A Man
Still A Child – Deep Inside
Deep Deep Inside
I Wandered Far And Wide
In The Dark And The Light
The Black And The White
