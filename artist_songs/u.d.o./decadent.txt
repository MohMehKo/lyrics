This is the world we're living in
Full of your pain and full of sin
Tighten your belt and work real hard
And be a slave to me

My home is my castle
Your's - the mud
And never the truth - shall meet
We are the money
You are the debt
So give it all - to me

Hear me - the world is out of hand
Heal me - bring hope to our land

Decadent - we are so decadent
This is a decadent world
So decadent

We have the taste of milk and honey
No remorse and no more pity
We live our lives upon your backs
We grind you in the shit

Save me - give us a helping hand
Feed me - before I reach the end

Decadent - we are so decadent
This is a decadent world
So decadent

We are so decadent - decadent
This is a decadent world
So decadent

Is that a child I see
Arms outstretched to me
What do I care if it dies
It means nothing to me

Decadent - we are so decadent
This is a decadent world
So decadent

We are so decadent - decadent
This is a decadent world
So decadent
