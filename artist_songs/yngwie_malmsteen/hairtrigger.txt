I told you once and
I told you twice
You will fall and
I will rise
Tell me now who's fooling who
One of us must surely die
It isn't me, it must be you
You're my holy sacrifice
Hairtrigger-telling you no lies
Hairtrigger-time to say goodbye
You will cry and
You will pray
There's no escape
It's judgement day!
Deep inside you know too well
In my hands I hold your fate
In the end we'll meet in hell
You're my holy sacrifice
Hairtrigger-now the time has come
Hairtrigger-nowhere left to run
Hairtrigger.
