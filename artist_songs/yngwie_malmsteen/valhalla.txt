Valhalla…
Pick up your sword…
And get your ass on to the battlefield
This hell on earth
That you call your life
We'll snuff it out
And you're gonna die.

We come from the north
We come from the ice
We live dangerously
And very short lives
We fight day by day
Sailing the seas
We're natural born slayers
We live by the sword
And die by the sword
We're never afraid
And to drink with the Gods
To be singing their songs.

I raise my cup in Valhalla
To feast in their halls
And laugh with them all
I raise my cup in Valhalla.

Valhalla
You live by the sword…

The hammer of Thor
Beating you down
The thunder crashing
Through your door.

With the gods by our side
We follow the stars
As we're sailing into
This holy war.

We come from the north
We come from the ice
We live dangerously
And very short lives
We fight day by day
Sailing the seas
We're natural born slayers
We live by the sword
And die by the sword
We're never afraid
And to drink with the gods
To be singing their songs
I raise my cup in Valhalla
To feast in their halls
And laugh with them all
I raise my cup in Valhalla.

Valhalla
We live by the sword
And die by the sword.

Valhalla…

We come from the north
We come from the ice
We live dangerously
And very short lives
We fight day by day
Sailing the seas
We're natural born slayers
We live by the sword
And die by the sword
We're never afraid
And to drink with the gods
To be singing their songs
I raise my cup in Valhalla
To feast in their halls
And laugh with them all
I raise my cup in Valhalla.
