I've been searching for you
For so long
My life's been sacrificed
I've been longing for truth
And now I have found
All that in you

Like an angel you came to me
And now I see
The stranger in me is finally free
To fel true love

From heaven I knew you were born
On the wings of love
You were brought to me
I've been longing for truth
Journeyed so far
To be with you

Like an angel you came to me
And now I see
The stranger in me is finally free
To fel true love
