Now it's so clear
What I always feared
To walk that lonely road
Without you
And thou I'm afraid
It's never too late
Now's the time to make our dreams come true
Eternal flame keeps burning on and on
Forever one
I hear the angels calling out your name
I felt so low
As the days turned cold
I know our love
Will conquer all
You walked into my life
I was born again
Now's the time to make our dreams come true
Forever one
Eternal flame keeps burning on and on
Forever one
I hear the angels calling out your name
Forever one
Eternal flame keeps burning on and on.
