Living in a big world,
That ain't too kind to me.
Lookin' for some changes
That no one wants to see
Running round in circles
Nowhere left to go
Too many uniforms
Tryin' to run this show
I don't know
It's never what i wanted
Living in this heap
Got to get the hell out
I'm in too fuckin' deep
This world is a crazy place
I'll take it day by day
Lord, won't you help me
I got to get away
I don't know.
