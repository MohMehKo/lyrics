My heart
Fell into the palms of your hands
This love
Made me understand
I've waited all my life for you
Thought I'd live and die alone
Enraptured by the beauty
I'm a prisoner of your love
Enslaved by the passion
I'm a prisoner of your love
I'm wrapped around your finger
Like the ring on your hand
I'm trapped
By your love I'm yours, please understand
I've waited all my life for you
Thought I'd live and die alone
Enraptured by the beauty
I'm a prisoner of your love
Enslaved by the passion
I'm a prisoner of your love
Enraptured by the beauty
I'm a prisoner of your love
Enslaved by the passion
I'm a prisoner of your love
Enraptured by the beauty
I'm a prisoner of your love
Enslaved by the passion
I'm a prisoner of your love.
