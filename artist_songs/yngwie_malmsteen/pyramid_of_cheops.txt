For eons they reigned
With blood, with pain
Our souls devoured
In a temple of power
Stone by stone
Life by life sacrifice
With the whips and the chains
They will build
No matter what
Pay the price
With our flesh and bone
Soon reaching the sky
But many must die
This temple will bring
Eternal life for the king
Stone by stone
Life by life sacrifice
With the whips and the chains
They will build
No matter what
Pay the price
With our flesh and bone.
