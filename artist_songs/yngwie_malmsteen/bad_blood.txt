One word is spoken, and the silence breaks
Promises broken, as the heartache seeps in
Now I'm believing, all the things that I hear
Oh no more deceiving, cause I see you so clear
Wounds left to heal
Coldness I feel
Like ice through my veins
Bad blood-don't be bringing me down
Bad blood-can't put me in the ground
Bad blood-bitch you're not killing me
Bad blood-no other way it's gonna be
Your love is like prison, and I'm doing time
Waiting for freedom, while losing my mind
Too many reasons and to many lies
Now I'm through believin' you've opened my eyes
Bad blood-there's no one to blame
Bad blood-no more lying, no more pain
Bad blood-oh there's nothing left to say
Bad blood-it can't be no other way
Bad blood-don't be bringing me down
Bad blood-can't put me in the ground
Bad blood-oh there's nothing left to say
Bad, bad, bad blood.
