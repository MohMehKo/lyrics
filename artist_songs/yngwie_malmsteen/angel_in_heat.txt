You drive me crazy, out of my mind
You really do it to me, you're one of a kind
You sucked me in like a magnet, now I'm addicted to you
I'm always ready, ready for you

You turned me on, you make me explode
Too much is never enough
With ecstasy you'll give it to me
Too much is never enough

You taste so sweet, baby
Angel in heat
You're so sweat
Angel in heat

The way you do it to me, the way you use your lips
You make me scream n' we go down for another trip
Never ending feeling the way it must be
Our desire brings us higher

You turned me on, you make me explode
Too much is never enough
With ecstasy you'll give it to me
Too much is never enough

You taste so sweet, baby
Angel in heat
You're so sweat
Angel in heat

I know you love it n' I love it too
You give it to me n' I give it to you
Keep on, keep on, never stop
Let's go over the top

You turned me on, you make me explode
Too much is never enough
With ecstasy you'll give it to me
Too much is never enough

You taste so sweet, baby
Angel in heat
You're so sweat
Angel in heat
