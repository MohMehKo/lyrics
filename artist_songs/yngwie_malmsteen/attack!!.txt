Living large, living free
Living the life that dreams are made of
Dying proud, dying free
Dying the death of heroes.

But what you've down now
Makes me want to cry
You keep on pushing
Well now you've pushed too far
You must die now…

Once we were free
Living in perfect harmony
It's much too late
And now there's no turning back.

Attack…

Out of the blue
Out of the sky
The world comes crashing down
Not it's out of true
We've been blown sky high
And the king has lost his crown.

We must be fearless
And be relentless
Kill these insects
Show no mercy
You must die now…
Once we were free
Living in perfect harmony
It's much too late
And now there's no turning back.

Attack…

Once we were free
Living on perfect harmony
It's much too late
And now there's no turning back.

Attack…
