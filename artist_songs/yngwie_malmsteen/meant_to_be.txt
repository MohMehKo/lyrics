I've been searching
All my life
I've been hurting
Living lies
In the dark
Trying to find true love
In my heart
No time to lose, goodbye to blues
Why can't you see
We were meant to be
We're walking through fire
We're stronger than steel
We've joined our souls
Now we're free
We've reached our souls
We finally see
Yesterday we lived in sorrow
We live today for tomorrow
No time to lose, goodbye to blues
Why can't you see
We were meant to be
We're walking through fire
We're stronger than steel.
