I'm standing by the riverside
Dreaming, hope come save me now
I'm feeling like I can't escape
Screaming, love come pull me out

All this darkness inside me
Well, I'm the creator
All this loneliness I feel, I'm the creator
The earth heaves inside of me
And there's a forest set to light
So this passion can burn!

Burn like a forest fire!
It burns, burns like a forest fire
Lost in a winter's storm like wolves,
With no stars to use as guides

We're still breathing and we're the lucky ones
The weeping willows on the banks
Where the rivers used to run
So, still sway with the breeze
But don't fall down to your knees
(Hope come save me now)

I'm standing by the riverside
And I'm dreaming, hope come save me now
I'm feeling like I can't escape
And I'm screaming, love come pull me out

We have lived in the shadows now
For far too fucking long
Pull the wool from your eyes
Tear the darkness away
We won't exist underground
For the rest of our days

But we're still breathing and we're the lucky ones
The weeping willows on the banks
Where the rivers used to run
So still sway with the breeze
But don't fall down to your knees
(Hope come save me now)

I'm standing by the riverside
And I'm dreaming, hope come save me now
I'm feeling like I can't escape
And I'm screaming, love come pull me out

I'm standing by the riverside
And I'm dreaming, hope come save me now
I'm feeling like I can't escape
And I'm screaming, love come pull me out

All this darkness inside me
Well, I'm the creator
All this loneliness I feel, I'm the creator
The earth heaves inside of me
And there's a forest set to light
So this passion can burn

Burn like a forest fire
It burns, burns like a forest fire

Burn like a forest fire
It burns, burns like a forest fire
