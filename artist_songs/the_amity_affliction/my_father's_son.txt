I am my father's son
I am my father's mistakes
I'm easily undone
And I'm no stranger to rage
I am no stranger to rage

I am no stranger to rage

I felt the power of the bottles.
Killed myself just to escape
I am my father's son
I am my father's mistakes

And I'm ashamed of myself
I just want out of this place
This fucking hell I've created
I can't seem to escape

I have to learn from myself
The fastest way to my death
So I could follow his footsteps
To my hospital bed

All my life I have been trying to understand myself
It seems like my own reflection is just somebody else
It's taken years to know my father courses through my veins
And though I never knew him, it turns out we're the same

I am no stranger to rage

I am my father's son
I make my father's mistakes
I've been through shadows alone
And found my home on the streets

I've felt the cold glare of strangers,
As they passed over me.
I never figured I'd turn out to be such a disgrace,
But I'm my father's son,
The sum of all his mistakes.

I have to learn from myself
The fastest way to my death
So I could follow his footsteps
To my hospital bed

All my life I have been trying to understand myself
It seems like my own reflection is just somebody else
It's taken years to know my father courses through my veins
And though I never knew him, it turns out we're the same

I am no stranger to rage

[4x]
I never knew him
It turns out we're the same

I am my father's son [3x]
I made my father's mistakes

I am my father's son [4x]
