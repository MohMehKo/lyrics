When you're standing on the edge
(When you're standing on the edge)
Waiting to hear from the
(Waiting to hear from the)
All the angels you hope will
(All the angels you hope will)
I can tell you right now
They will never be
There to save you, like you hoped they would

So when you're standing on the edge waiting
To hear from 
All the angels you hope 
Will come to save you
I can tell you right now, they will never be
There for you and time waits for no one;

You did this on your own
There's no one here don't you know
Where were you when we grew wings
And learnt to fly?
On your own, where are your friends that you were running from?
So where were you when we grew wings and learnt to fly?

You will be on your own 
As you're waiting for 
The angels you hope
Hope will come to save you
So where we you when we grew wings?
Where were you when we grew our fucking wings?
So where were you when we grew our wings?
You did this on your own..

So when you're standing on the edge waiting 
To hear from 
All the angels you hope 
Will come to save you 
I can tell you all right now they will, never be 
There for you and time waits for no one;

You're all alone 
You're holding your heart 
You're all alone 
But don't turn to me

These cliffs aren't frozen anymore 
And these wings of lead 
Have lost their dead weight
These cliffs aren't frozen anymore 
And these wings of lead have lost their dead weight

So when you're standing on the edge waiting
To hear from
All the angels you hope 
Will come to save you 
I can tell you all right now they will never be 
There for you and time waits for no one..

So when you're standing on the edge 
waiting to hear from all the angels you hope will come..
