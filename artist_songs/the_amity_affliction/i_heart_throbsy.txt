You'd, give up the world, take on the earth
But you'll falter I can see it in the way
Your tourniquet is bound
Weak as your will at the lowest point

You'd give up your life, just to feel the earth
Fall away beneath your feet again, gasping for breath with a lack of will
The lowest point brought about by you

And they still stand there with their arms outstretched, 
and that's how it will be forever more
And on until the ocean, delivers you from your chosen place
Your former contempt for yourself and life as you held it prior

You'd, give up the word
To take on the earth
But you'll falter I can see it in the way
Your tourniquet is bound
Weak as your will at the lowest point

You'd give up your life, just to feel the earth
Fall away beneath you feet again, gasping for breath with a lack of will
The lowest point brought about by you

Oh, you'd give up the world
Just to feel the earth fall away beneath your feet, 
but I'll wait right here for you

You'd give up the world, but the world is here, 
waiting for you to outstretch your arms
Waiting with bated breath, for you to realise, 
that you're worth more than the value you've placed on yourself
You're worth more than that value..

You'd give up the world, but the world is here
Waiting for you to outstretch yours arms
Waiting with bated breath, for you to realise
You're worth more than the value you've placed on yourself
You're worth more than the value, you've placed on yourself
