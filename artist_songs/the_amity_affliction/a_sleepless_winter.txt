I awaken from this cold sweat, saturated in my own contempt
Nothing left but broken fragments of cherished memories once spent 
I’ve screamed blue murder in futility and smashed up walls 
to bleed this pain away but I can’t escape from this disarray 

Incidentally I’ve already seen the worst of this and I, 
I can’t deny this pain inside nowhere to hide (from dusk ‘til dawn)
A sleepless winter in between tragic tales of broken glass 
I’ll bathe my scars in cyanide; I won’t be coming back this time

These sleepless nights are killing me
What awaits me in my decrepit dream
Aversion and despondency (scarification, monotonously) 
I’ve screamed blue murder in futility 
and smashed up walls to bleed this pain away 
But I can’t escape from this disarray 

Incidentally I’ve already seen the worst of this and I, 
I can’t deny this pain inside nowhere to hide (from dusk ‘til dawn)
A sleepless winter in between tragic tales of broken glass 
I’ll bathe my scars in cyanide; I won’t be coming back this time

Release me from this nightmare

Incidentally I’ve already seen the worst of this and I, 
I can’t deny this pain inside nowhere to hide (from dusk ‘til dawn)
A sleepless winter in between tragic tales of broken glass 
I’ll bathe my scars in cyanide; I won’t be coming back this time
I won’t be coming back this time (coming back this time)
