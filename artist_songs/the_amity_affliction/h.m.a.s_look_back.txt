I've been staring for weeks
At the cold rusted sheets
And the broken down pillars
Of the years that passed by
At the cold depths of rivers
And the moons that have fallen
And risen as halves
I've been star gazing and

Whispering to myself in the night
And by the river at dawn
I have discovered the light
I've been watching the tides
And I've been feeling their flow
And it's a humbling experience
To watch as they grow

Down
Where the beauty of our dreams
Touches the beauty of the sky
And the stars in our oceans
Become the stars in our eyes
Where we reach out to forever
For just one last grasp at hope
Where the tides ebb and flow
Is all our minds really know

They leave in short breaths
Returning to give
And to hold and to steal
And it's calming and it heals
And it's softening it seems
To leave my past behind
Join the tide
And head out toward the sea

Down
Where the beauty of our dreams
Touches the beauty of the sky
And the stars in our oceans
Become the stars in our eyes
Where we reach out to forever
For just one last grasp at hope
Where the tides ebb and flow
Is all our minds really know

I'm lost in a moment
Where the tide embraces me
Where I fall into the river
And set sail toward the sea
I'm lost and I'm dreaming
I'm lost and I'm feeling
Like this has waited
Forever to finally take me
[x2]

Down
Where the beauty of our dreams
Touches the beauty of the sky
And the stars in our oceans
Become the stars in our eyes
Where we reach out to forever
For just one last grasp at hope
Where the tides ebb and flow
Is all our minds really know
