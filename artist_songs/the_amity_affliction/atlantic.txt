This is not who I am, I’m still hiding
I’m waiting in my own reflection
Hands shaking with anxiety
Heart beating out of time

Only I can hear my breath at night
This is not who I was hoping to become
This shell of a man
This dark exterior given to 
Stormy moods and quiet, lonely tears
This is not who I was hoping to become
This shell of a man (My Hands are shaking with anxiety)
This dark exterior…

Only I can hear my breath at night
This is not who I was hoping to become
This shell of a man
This dark exterior given to 
Stormy moods and quiet, lonely tears

Steal this night from me
Take it and make it your own

These are not the nights I wish for
These nights are cold and unrelenting
These nights are depressing
These nights bring knives 
So as they can carve themselves into my memory
Leave me here alone
Kill the breeze on your way out
And let me ferment in my own self-pity
Let me ferment, let me ferment in my own self-pity

These are not the nights I wish for
These nights are cold and unrelenting
These nights are depressing
These nights bring knives
These nights bring knives

Leave me here alone…
Leave me here alone…

Kill the breeze on your way out
And let me ferment in my own self-pity
