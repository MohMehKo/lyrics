Well once again…
We set sail toward the sky (The Sky with wings of lead)
From frozen cliffs with wings of lead (We Find Ourselves)
And we find ourselves once more (back where we began)
The cornerstone of misery…

I am ready to breathe again
If I had a million last words to tell you 

These words are the end of the solitude 
Which held fast for so long inside this cold shell of a human being

They could never be adequate
They could never hold true
So I’m left dreaming of angels 
Weaving a symphony (In blue skies)
I Dream of angels (these are the dreams you inspire)
Weaving a symphony in blue skies
Well once again
Well once again

We set sail toward the sky (The Sky with wings of lead)
From frozen cliffs with wings of lead (We Find Ourselves)
And we find ourselves once more (back where we began)
The cornerstone of misery…

Those torn wings which grounded me for so long 
Have been given new life
So now I can fly with you as we cry for joy while staring at the sun
Nothing can be as bright as this today
No star can shine so beautifully tonight

We Find Ourselves…
Back where we began…
We Find Ourselves…
Back where we began…
We Find Ourselves…

Well once again…
We set sail toward the sky (The Sky with wings of lead)
From frozen cliffs with wings of lead (We Find Ourselves)
And we find ourselves once more (back where we began)
The cornerstone of misery…
The Sky with wings of lead
We Find Ourselves
