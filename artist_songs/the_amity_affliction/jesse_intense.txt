I let go of these cold nights long ago and now it's time for you to follow suit. 
Take those night sky tears and burning eyes stinging from pursuit; 
take your regret and sallow timbre and throw it to the ocean 
where misery can seek it out - you know misery loves a lonely stranger.

And you've been waiting with open arms for so long, so long. 
Take a breath and roll it out, it's high time for your chest 
to resonate something more tangible. The angles, they're cutting in, 
they're destroying the cohesion, cutting ties and killing friends. 
So long, so long that now it seems to be a farce, but it's painted on your face 
like the spread of an open book: time to throw it to the fire. 
Settle down beneath the ocean, stare upwards raise your arms and say goodnight; 
tomorrow the sun dawns on settled scores, 
and homeward bound, and homeward bound

Oh yeah
you'll find your solace, you'll find your solace,
you'll find your solidarity and peace.
