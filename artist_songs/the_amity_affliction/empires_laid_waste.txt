I can’t prolong the inevitable anymore…
The hidden empire inside our hearts
We built, we burnt, and we laid…we laid waste 
To every dream and we gave flight to this ending
It’s so hard to turn around 
Without even understanding the fall…

To break our wings, to burn our dreams
I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, fear, and regret!

Set fire to the way we were and forget everything
Set fire to the way we were and forget everything
When every stone is turned 
When every stone is turned looking for an escape 
There’s not too much left anyway
There’s only so far you can travel with stars in your eyes

The hidden empire inside our hearts
We built, we burnt, and we laid…we laid waste 
To every dream and we gave flight to this ending
It’s so hard to turn around 
Without even understanding the fall…

There’s only so far you can travel with stars in your eyes
Before you burn them out and lose sight
Before you break down
Before you break down and take it all in your stride
A life lost, and the fall of an empire
