Why are we even breathing
If the only reason to exist
Is to stare skyward and put my hands together
Then why am I even here
To serve a myth
And carry these burdens on my chest
As it caves in and free will gives way
To a guilt of lost and misrepresented verses

I can't see the logic in falling to my knees
Where is the logic
There is no logic

I was blinded and inducted
Into a world that has no meaning
No basis for belief
And now they wonder why I'm seething
I'll spit this in their faces
And burn their false pretences
On which they stand
The pulpit burying our youth
Beneath the tides of callous sands
No room to breathe, oh
No room to brea-ea-ea-ea-ea-eathe

In the chambers of your guilt
Under the cross and devil's gaze
While you sit and wait to die
There'll be no god
In the cold night sky

There's no god who can hear you
There's no god who understands
Who understands
Regrets too often haunt us
Again and again
Sometimes it seems so hopeless
But we cannot give in
When all our best decisions
Prove us wrong
And when we're only waiting
For goodbyes
We've already given in, given in
We've already given in given in
We've already given in,
We've already given in, given in
But we're never giving in

There is no god who can hear you
Just a sky full of stars
The same stars you will be wishing on
When death comes to call on us
Call on us
