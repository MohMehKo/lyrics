I've been trying to find the space and time
To let them know just what it's like
To be feeling so alone
To be feeling so alone
I know you stayed there waiting for
The world to heal itself
The world we existed in
The fucking world I turned to hell

If only I
Could fall through the earth
To reach you when the sun decides to set
Take your hand and let you feel
The warmth of grace's breath
I am the heart that keeps on beating
While you close your eyes at night
Not before and not forever
Will our hearts not beat together
And now it's happening again

I've been trying to find the space and time
To let them know just what it's like 
To be feeling so alone
To be feeling so alone
And I know you stayed there waiting for
The world to heal itself
The world we existed in
The fucking world I turned to hell
And now it's happening again

And we are wishing things could just go back
To how they used to be
We've lost the innocence of youth
And left our hearts by the wayside
But I can tell in the years to come
We'll get it back and you will breathe ever so deeply

Then let go of all the heaviness
You've carried for so many years
Throughout the pain
Throughout the fear
Just know that I'll be here

I've been trying to find the space and time
To let them know just what it's like 
To be feeling so alone
To be feeling so alone
And I know you stayed there waiting for
The world to heal itself
The world we existed in
The fucking world I turned to hell
And now it's happening again

Throughout the pain
Throughout the fear
Just know that I am here
Throughout the pain
Throughout the fear
Just know that I am here
Just know, just know
Just know that I am here
