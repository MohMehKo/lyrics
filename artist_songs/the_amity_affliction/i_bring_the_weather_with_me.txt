I bring the weather with me

It's time to lay my head down
I can hear the weeping song
There are sirens in the distance
As the church bells sound along
Mourning ushers in the rain
Clouds are heavy like their hearts
I sing to them their weeping song
Until their world is dark

We are all stars in the sky
We all shimmer then decay
So I wonder - did I burn out,
Make a mark or fade away?

Will you miss me when I'm gone?
I am the storm that never leaves
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
I bring the, I bring the weather with me.

I'm the ship in the bottle
Rain pouring down on me
I sing songs for my funeral
That I will never see
You were my shining light
Oh, you were heaven sent
But now I'm not afraid of leaving
Not of God, and not of Death.

We are all stars in the sky
We all shimmer then decay
So I wonder - did I burn out,
Make a mark or fade away?

Will you miss me when I'm gone?
I am the storm that never leaves
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
I bring the, I bring the weather with me.

Place the pennies on my eyes
I'll sleep with the stars tonight.

Will you miss me when I'm gone?
I am the storm that never leaves
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
I bring the, I bring the weather with me.
