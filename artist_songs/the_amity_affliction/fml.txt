There are parts of me that have been lost at sea, I feel like I'm sinking into eternity.
Walk with my head hung low, in calamity, with my arms outstretched, for someone to save me.

I am a sinking ship, I am the anchors deep, set to the ocean floor in an eternal sleep.
My heart is heavy stone, my body brittle bones, my mind an endless storm out in the cold unknown.
Cause I've got to find my light again, my heart is beating fast when will this ever end?
Can I find my way back home again?
This road I travel on, it never seems to end.

I ain't a hollow shell no more, I've left the ocean floor - I've left the ocean floor.
My heart's a heavy hitter now.
My lungs they're screaming out, my heart's a heavy hitter now.

I am a sinking ship, I am the anchors deep, set to the ocean floor in an eternal sleep.
My heart is heavy stone, my body brittle bones.
My mind an endless storm in the cold unknown.
'Cause I've got to find my light again, my heart is beating fast when will this ever end?
Can I find my way back home again?
This road I travel on it never seems to end.

And once again you came back, and you rescued me, and I promise you that, I promise that I'm out.
I promise you that I'm out.
My heart's a heavy hitter now.
My fists are firmly clenched again and this is thanks to you my friend...

'Cause I've got to find my light again, my heart is beating fast when will this ever end?
Can I find my way back home again?
This road I travel on it never seems to end.
