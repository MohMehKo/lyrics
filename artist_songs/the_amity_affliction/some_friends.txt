I am on my own
And in a crowd of people I feel disowned
Farewells are cold
And I drown in the rain that fills my soul

Talking to myself
Pushing everyone away
They can't see it in my eyes
But I need them to stay

Some friends will depart, some stay the same
Some will fuel the anger, some heal the pain
Some will help me up, some tear me down
But what goes around comes around

Yeah what goes around comes around
Yeah

I'm hard on myself I need you to know
If I bottle it up any more I'll explode
So you're sick of me too? Well my friend get in line
'Cause I'm sick of myself, yeah I'm sick of trying

Talking to myself
Is overcoming nothing
And the thought remains the same:
Is it all for nothing?

Some friends will depart, some stay the same
Some will fuel the anger, some heal the pain
Some will help me up, some tear me down
But what goes around comes around
Some friends will depart, some stay the same
Some will fuel the anger, some heal the pain
Some will help me up, some tear me down
But what goes around comes around

What goes around comes around

I always knew you'd turn your back on me
I always knew you'd turn your back on me

Talking to myself
Pushing everyone away
They can't see it in my eyes
Oh oh oh oh
Talking to myself
Is overcoming nothing
And the thought remains the same:
Is it all for nothing?

Some friends will depart, some stay the same
Some will fuel the anger, some heal the pain
Some will help me up, some tear me down
But what goes around comes around
Some friends will depart, some stay the same
Some will fuel the anger, some heal the pain
Some will help me up, some tear me down
But what goes around comes around
