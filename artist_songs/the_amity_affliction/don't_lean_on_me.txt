Let the ocean take me...

You've gotta know kid that it ain't easy.
To take on all of your grieving, yeah you gotta believe me.

[Chorus:]
Well don't lean on me 'cause I am falling, please don't fall with me.
I really need you here, yeah I need you so don't leave.
And don't count on me 'cause I am drowning, please don't drown with me.
Just hold me in your heart, let the ocean take me.

And you think I don't read every message that you send?
You think I turn a blind eye, you think I'm just like them?
It breaks my heart, all these stories, brings me to tears all this grief;
And I feel so fucking helpless when I can't be your relief.

[Chorus:]
Well don't lean on me 'cause I am falling, please don't fall with me.
I really need you here, yeah I need you so don't leave.
And don't count on me 'cause I am drowning, please don't drown with me.
Just hold me in your heart, let the ocean take me.

There is hope in my eyes, there is hope in these words.
And there are far too many reasons for you to stay here on this earth. Stay with me.

[Chorus:]
Well don't lean on me 'cause I am falling, please don't fall with me.
I really need you here, yeah I need you so don't leave.
And don't count on me 'cause I am drowning,
Please don't drown with me. Just hold me in your heart,
Let the ocean take me. (oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh) Yeah.
Let the ocean take me. (oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh) Yeah.
Let the ocean take me
