I said farewell to the sunlight,
Said farewell to the sea,
And farewell to my loved ones,
There's no hope left for me!
Farewell to my sorrow,
And farewell memories,
Misery for company,
There's no hope left for me!

I was searching for religion,
Thought I'd find my place,
But there was nothing there but empty faith
How can you find your way through ignorance, intolerance, and hate?

Farewell I'm gone you won't find me,
I've lost my faith but I am free,
So search your heart and you will see there's no hope in misery.

I said farewell to the sunlight,
Said farewell to the sea,
And farewell to my loved ones,
There's no hope left for me!
Farewell to my sorrow,
And farewell memories,
Misery for company,
There's no hope left for me!

No hope!
No hope!
No hope left for me!

No gods!
No gods!
No gods left for me!

No hope!
No hope!
No hope left for me!

Farewell I'm gone you won't find me,
I've lost my faith but I am free,
So search your heart and you will see there's no hope in misery.

I said farewell to the sunlight,
Said farewell to the sea,
And farewell to my loved ones,
There's no hope left for me!
Farewell to my sorrow,
And farewell memories,
Misery for company,
There's no hope left for me!

Farewell I'm gone you won't find me,
Farewell I'm gone you won't find me,
Farewell I'm gone you won't find me,
Farewell I'm gone you won't find me...
