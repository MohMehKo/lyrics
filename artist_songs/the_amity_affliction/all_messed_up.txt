When I wake up I'm thankful I slept through the night
Cause that is the only time I feel alright
Keep my eyes closed so I sleep the sadness away
When I wake up I'm sure that it won't be the same

All the panic, depression, the hurt and regret
Lying to myself - "I don't think of death..."
All the ups all the downs, all the petty concerns
My whole world's imploding I can't find the words
Cause the truth is... I'm messed up

The truth is that I'm all messed up - like you
Yeah we're all messed up it's true
(The truth is that I'm all messed up - like you
Yeah we're all messed up)
And the truth is, they don't hear the words we say
Yeah they all just turn away
(The truth is, they don't hear the words we say
Yeah they're all messed up)

If I wake up tomorrow just know that I tried
To find a way out without saying goodbye

All the panic, depression, the hurt and regret
Lying to myself - "I don't think of death..."
All the ups all the downs, all the petty concerns
My whole world's imploding, I can't find the words
Cause the truth is... I'm messed up

The truth is that I'm all messed up - like you
Yeah we're all messed up it's true
(The truth is that I'm all messed up - like you
Yeah we're all messed up)
And the truth is, they don't hear the words we say
Yeah they all just turn away
(The truth is, they don't hear the words we say
Yeah they're all messed up)

Will you save my life? (Will you save my life?)
Or just say goodbye? (Say goodbye!)
Will you save my life? (Will you save my life?)
Or just say goodbye? (Say goodbye!)
