Party
Party, All night, Party, 
Why the fuck should we change how we behave, 
because you thought it would work better that way 
And who the fuck told you that you should speak up about how it is we act, 
about who the fuck we are when we don't cast our eyes your way 
And who the fuck are you anyway 
We're no one and we still feel right at home, 
we're no one and we're still just passing time 
to kill the time, to kill the boredom. 
Who the fuck can say what we should do 
We drink till we drop and we'll drink till we die 
We're not here for a long time, 

Party
Party, All night, Party,

we're not here to help your night, 
we're not here to set shit right; we're just here for a good time, 
and friends are our own friends and our own, 
are our only; and tonight is the last night. 
And fuck you for thinking you could ever set us right. 
Who are you anyway to think you could change us? 
Tonight is our own night, tonight is our only, we're lonely, we're wasted!

And who the fuck are you anyway 
We're no one and we still feel right at home, 
we're no one and we're still just passing time 
to kill the time, to kill the boredom. 
Who the fuck can say what we should do 
We drink till we drop and we'll drink till we die 
We're not here for a long time... 
We're not here for a long time...
We're not here for a long time...

Party.
