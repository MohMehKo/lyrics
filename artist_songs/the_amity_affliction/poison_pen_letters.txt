Dying alone would be a privilege 
if all my friends were like you. 
Dying would be a privilege. 
if all my friends were like you.

Rusted rail spikes and shards of glass give me rest, 
poison the earth in anticipation. 
Rusted rail spikes and shards of glass, 
poison the earth in anticipation...
poison the earth in anticipation.

So tear the pieces from the bone like you've torn us apart. 
We've built bridges just for burning. 
So light the fires in my eyes so I can watch my own demise. 
We've built bridges just for burning. 

Light the fires in my eyes,
watch my own demise, watch my own demise
so I can rip my eyes from their sockets, so I can rip my eyes, 
so I can rip my eyes so no flowers will grow. 

So tear the pieces from the bone like you've torn us apart. 
We've built bridges just for burning. 
So light the fires in my eyes so I can watch my own demise. 
We've built bridges just for burning.
just for burning.

And so you carve your, your name into my, 
into my heart with rusted rail spikes. 

So light the fires in my eyes so I, can let them watch, my own demise. 
So I can leave this all behind and be left with my solitude intact.

So tear the pieces from the bone like you've torn us apart. 
We've built bridges just for burning. 
So light the fires in my eyes so I can watch my own demise. 
We've built bridges just for burning.
just for burning.
