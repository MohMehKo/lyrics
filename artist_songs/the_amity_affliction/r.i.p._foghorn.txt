It's never easy to face yourself 
Everyday, through the fog of shrouded memories
It's never easy to face your past
Everyday, through the haze of the aftermath

Yeah
It's never easy to admit 
That you've faltered and fallen
You can't do this alone
That you can't do this all alone
I've felt the fear in your eyes
I've slipped into that void
And I've felt the cold of the morning
And I know

It's never easy to admit
That you've faltered and fallen
And you can't do this alone
Down in that void buried so deep
Searching for love but not for sleep
Just know that nothing's set in stone

And I know how some others won't
The cold steel and regret
The failure and remorse
Just trying to tell you
You're not here alone

OH
We're all in this together
Shining bright through the fog
Filling the skies with our light
With our light, with our light

It's never easy to admit
That you've faltered and fallen
And you can't do this alone
Down in that void buried so deep
Searching for love but not for sleep
Just know that nothing's set in stone

Don't be the one
To bear the weight of the world
While that world passes by

It's never easy to admit 
That you've faltered 
That you've fallen
I'm just trying to tell you 
That you aren't here alone

It's never easy to admit
That you've faltered and fallen
And you can't do this alone
Down in that void buried so deep
Searching for love but not for sleep
Just know that nothing's set in stone

We're all in this together
Shining bright through the fog
We're all in this together.
