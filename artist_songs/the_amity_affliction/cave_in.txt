Don't let your life cave in.
No brother, don't let your life cave in.

I keep sinking; you know that feeling,
when you're just struggling to find some meaning.
Look inside and you crumble at the undead weight,
while everyone around you gets so sick of waiting.

I've struggled and I'm falling 
and I'll be god damned if I don't lose it.
...

So hold on tight, there's more to life.
Cause when you're lost and dreaming about the end 
and want to end your life: hold on, hold on.
I thought you were meaning. 
Hold on, hold on.
Don't say that it's over.

Don't let your life cave in.
No brother, don't let your life cave in.

And you know and I know and we both know,
that it could end. But brother, don't let your life cave in.

I've struggled and I'm falling 
and I'll be god damned if I don't lose it.

So hold on tight, there's more to life.
Cause when you're lost and dreaming about the end 
and want to end your life: hold on, hold on.
I thought you were meaning. 
Hold on, hold on.
Don't say that it's over now.

But the world is waiting while your heart is changing, 
and your hands are shaking and you sit there screaming.
But the world is waiting while your heart is changing,
and your hands are shaking while you sit there screaming.

Why can't I cave in

And you know and I know and we both know,
that it could end. But brother, don't let your life cave in.

We're all facing demons in life. 
And we're all finding ourselves amidst the struggles of our life.
You're not alone!
