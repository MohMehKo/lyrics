I know that you've been searching
For me elsewhere
In the cracks beneath your feet
In the spaces between walls
In the dark wells of the mirror
In the place I used to stand
I know that you've been searching
For me elsewhere

In the black pits of my mind
Where the tar of my emotions
Swirls black and ever thicker
Where I retreat
To hide from life
I have the reaper in my heart
And black tar pits for eyes

I have the cold heart of the lost ones
And no love to tear us apart
I know that you've been searching
In the spaces between words
But let me tell you
There's nothing there to read
There to read

Well I know that you've been searching
And you've looked inside your heart
But under oceans and in coffins
Is a better place to start
Place to start

You can't begin to know 
The depths of the abyss
Until you've lost it all
Until you've seen yourself
Cause that reflection just
Ain't what it used to be
It sure as hell ain't what I want to see

Well I know that you've been searching
And you've looked inside your heart
But under oceans and in coffins
Is a better place to start

Heartbreak is the burden I bear
And the bottle's, is the blood I smear
Oh
Just burdens
Just guilt
Just loss
And just fear

Well I know that you've been searching
And you've looked inside your heart
But under oceans and in coffins
Is a better place to start
