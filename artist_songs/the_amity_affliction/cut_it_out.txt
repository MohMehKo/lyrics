You think we're fucking blind, you think we're so blind
But we see every cut and every scar
So cut it out

So drag the knife across 
And break our hearts again

So drag the knife, across your skin
And break our hearts
So drag the knife, across your skin and cut it out
Cut out our hearts

We're here for you, we're here to share your hurt
So cut it out, just cut it out
Cut it out

Please stop cutting yourself 
Please stop cutting yourself
Please stop cutting yourself and cut it out

You think we're fucking blind, you think we're so blind 
but we see every cut and every scar 
So cut it out

So drag the knife across your skin and break our hearts again

I will be here for you, I will be here for you
Will be here for you, just stop cutting yourself and please cut it out
Just stop cutting yourselves and please cut it out
