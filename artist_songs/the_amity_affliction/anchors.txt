I have so many anchors
So many, so many
So many anchors
Far too many to be sailing on these seas
They're pulling me under
And I just want to be freed
But I'm just drowning and clasping

To the tinder and twine
Not the firm planks and rope
That I know to be mine
That I know to be mine
I have so many anchors
Bound to my feet
It feels like I'll forever be bound
To the bottom of these seas

Will you hear nothing I say
As the tide just sweeps and sways
As the anchors that bind me
Just rust and decay
As I tear my flesh from bone
As I scream out to the sky
When will I find my way home?

There are sirens watching me
And they whisper and smile to me
And I'm screaming out to them
Please take these anchors from my feet
OH

I see the moon up above
I've failed my hope
I've thrown out my love
I still want to live
I still want to hope
I still want to give
I still want to grow
I was dead and gone
I was cold and alone
I was weighed down and buried
When will I find my way home?

Will you hear nothing I say
As the tide just sweeps and sways
As the anchors that bind me
Just rust and decay
As I tear my flesh from bone
As I scream out to the sky
When will I find my way home?

Let's get it
When will I find my way home?
[x2]

Will you hear nothing I say
As the tide just sweeps and sways
As the anchors that bind me
Just rust and decay
As I tear my flesh from bone
As I scream out to the sky
When will I find my way home?

As I tear my flesh from bone
As I scream out toward the sky
When will I find my way home?
