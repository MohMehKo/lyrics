Just take it all, my heart, my mind, my every word from out of my lungs.
My every breath and every thought, and every word I've ever sung.
And though I'm glad to help you out, and get your feet back on the ground,
please understand I'm just a man - you understand? I'm just a man.

And I feel helpless when I stumble, and my anxiety escapes;
I lose all hope and I'm afraid that once again I've lost my place.

I give it all, and when I fall, I get up and give some more.
Until there's nothing left of me - just some bones stacked on the floor.

But every song's a two way street, I give to you, you give to me.
And as long as that remains I will still haul my heavy feet.
Because you're all worth every word, and yeah you're all here in my heart.
And I know we can sing together to avoid falling apart.

I give it all, and when I fall, I get up and give some more.
Until there's nothing left of me - just some bones stacked on the floor.

At the end of everything, this is for you, this is for me.
Your fight to overcome defeat has set the skies alight for me.

I give it all, and when I fall, I get up and give some more.
Until there's nothing left of me - just some bones stacked on the floor.
