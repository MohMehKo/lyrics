For so many years I held my breath for you
Held under what became the ocean
Struggling to find footing on what became the ocean floor
And now, as I reflect on what became my foundation

Who am I to say the grass was ever greener
Where my own feet struck the earth?
And that the fields, they seem much neater
On my own side of the fence
And who am I to question why you took the path you took?
And who the fuck am I to open this closed book?
But the pages just keep turning, turning

And my pen just won't run dry
But my eyes they won't stop burning
And yet you still have no reply

I guess that in a way
It had to be like this
And I guess that in a way
I'm glad it turned out like it did
Because I couldn't stand your sight if I ran into you tonight
And if you died right now I just don't think
I'd have too much to say tonight

And who am I to say the grass was ever greener
Where my own feet struck the earth?
And that the fields, they seem much neater
On my own side of the fence
And who am I to question why you took the path you took?
And who the fuck am I to open this closed book?
But the pages just keep turning, turning

If you hear this just forget it
If you hear this just forget it...

Oh!

[Sample taken from Hot Rod:]
"Beating me wouldn't mean anything now, I'm all through"
"All I want is to earn your respect
How am I meant to do that if you won't fight me?"
"Maybe you shoulv'e thought of that
Before you sucked at being a man your whole life"
"Oh my god, I hate you so much
I just wanna smash your face in"
"Too late, I'm a dead man..."
