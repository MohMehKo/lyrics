It's not for lack of percipience that I turned my back, 
it's just that I've become so absent from my own train of thought. 
I'm only just treading water...I'm only just treading water. 
I'm only just treading water...I'm only just treading water.

It's not for lack of faith in what was shared that I had to leave, 
it's just that I've lost track of all the things you said, 
and I'm only just treading water, just holding my head above the surface. 
I'm only just treading water, but it's starting to seep in- 
a breath to wake me, like the shock of falling as you drift away. 
I'm just not able to take it all in I'm only just treading water, 
but it's starting to seep in. 

I'm not saying there's anyone 
any one thing that's left me floating in the breeze, 
or that the earth has pulled me in. I'm just not where I should be. 
I've lost track of my own train of thought; 
and if the venom spills like turgid wine from the mouth 
to which I belong, forgive me.
I'm only just treading water; 
I'm only just above the surface of what I've become, 
with sleep confined to rotten dreams. 

I'm only just treading water, just holding my head above the surface. 
I'm only just treading water, but it's starting to seep in- 
a breath to wake me, like the shock of falling as you drift away. 
I'm just not able to take it all in I'm only just treading water,

I'm only just treading water, 
but it's starting to seep in- a breath to wake me, 
like the shock of falling as you drift away.
It's all that keeps me here. 
I'm only just treading water
It's all that keeps me here. 
I'm only just treading water but it's starting to seep in...
