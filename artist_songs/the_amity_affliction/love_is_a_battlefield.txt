(We are young, we are young)
We are young
(heartache to heartache)
Heartache to heartache, we stand
No promises,
No demands,
(love is a battlefield)
Love is a battlefield
Woah, woah, woah [x3]

We are strong (we are strong)
No one can tell us we're wrong
(we're wrong)
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of our hearts knowing
Love is a battlefield

You're making me go
You're making me sigh
Why do you hurt me so bad
It would help me know
Do I stand in your way
Or am I the best thing you had
Believe me, believe me
I can't tell you I
But I'm struck by your love
But I'm chained to your side

[Chorus:]
We are young
Heartache to heartache
We stand
No promises, no demands (demands)
Love is a battlefield
(woahhhh woah woah)
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
(we're wrong)
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

We are losing control
You turn me away
Oh touch me deep inside
Before this gets old
We still feel the same
Theres no way this will die
If we can push closer
We lose our control
If your heart surrenders
You leave me to hold

[Chorus x2]
