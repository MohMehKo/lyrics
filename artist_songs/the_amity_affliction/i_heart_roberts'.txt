We dance to this dead beat with eyes locked on the prize, 
this is our fatal disease, named you and me.
It's killing us all won't you set it free? 
I'll hang you on the wall and call you misery. 

So here's to you and here's to us, to everything that ever fell apart, 
nights wasted getting wasted, days we lost to our mistakes...

so we'll never be lost 'till we're all alone 
and we'll never be wrong till we're on our own 
so wake up and we'll drink for two again. 
And we'll never be right till we read our wrongs 
and we'll never be done with these same old songs, 
so wake up we'll wait for you again (again)

Like frozen appendages in boiling water 
we're going to extremes and not getting warmer. 
So hold your breath, and I'll do the same, 
are we just holding back those words we couldn't say?

So hold your breath I'll do the same, 
are we just holding back those words we...
I'll take the blame for your heart attack, 
and we'll sever these ties with a fucking pact. 
Through blood we share the world it's anybody's guess 
where we'll end up, our lives are just a fucking mess…
and we're sinking.  

so we'll never be lost 'till we're all alone 
and we'll never be wrong till we're on our own 
so wake up and we'll drink for two again. 
And we'll never be right till we read our wrongs 
and we'll never be done with these same old songs, 
so wake up we'll wait for you again (again)

He lays himself to rest even though he's making perfect sense…
his story goes untold I read his words to see the end unfold...

so we'll never be lost 'till we're all alone 
and we'll never be wrong till we're on our own 
so wake up and we'll drink for two again. 
And we'll never be right till we read our wrongs 
and we'll never be done with these same old songs, 
so wake up we'll wait for you again (again)
