Not a word, not hello
Nor how are you, nothing
No response, I’ve been eradicated 
I’ve been erased, and now…
Whispers would sound like screams at

Farewell to everything, this world has done to me 
Turns out I’m going to fit in just fine

In short, I would say, I would say its over, time to go
This world is dead to me turns out I’m going to fit in just fine

Everything I love turns a blind eye

Farewell to everything, this world is dead to me
Turns out I’m going to fit in just fine
I’m going to cut my arms open and pull at the heartstrings attached to my hands
Until they snap and die
That must be the way
Everything I touch falls to pieces
Everything I love turns a blind eye

I only wanted to love…
But it is not enough…

I hate this place I’m in and I only wanted to love but it is not enough…
