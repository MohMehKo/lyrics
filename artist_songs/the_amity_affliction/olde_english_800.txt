When your aspirations crumble
At the feet of your tormentors
And your jaw feels like it's breaking
On the cold hard tile floor
And you're holding onto something
That does far more harm than good
Well then you've reached the pits of hell
And there in hell you'll find the steel

To smash your skin until it's calloused
To grind your teeth down to the bone
To tear your tongue out from its shelter
And bleed out all alone
And when we get there we'll tread heavy
Through the boneyards and the filth
We'll grace the presence of the vultures
And spit fire of the gods

We'll both sit in our skin
And hate the places we have known
When your back feels like it's breaking
And your skin has turned to stone
And you are standing in the fire
And you are wishing to go back
Well then you've reached the pits of hell
Well then you've reached the pits of hell

I took this journey through the mirror
Took a chance to take my time
Just to watch the cold hard steel of burden
Come and break my heart and spine

I took a blade, a glass, a noose
And then I smashed my mind in two
With a bottle, pills and notion that I
Could drink my problems dead
I reached the cold pits of hell
And then I split my mind in two
And dragged my cold heart through the snow
And felt the coldest burn
Of all the grief I've come to know
Of all the grief I've come to know

I took this journey through the mirror
Took a chance to take my time
Just to watch the cold hard steel of burden
Come and break my heart and spine
[x2]

I've got a story here to tell you
Best you listen or grow cold
Cause if you choose the path I've chosen
Chances are you won't grow old
Won't grow old
