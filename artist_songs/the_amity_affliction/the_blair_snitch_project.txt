The walls white, skies white,
nights white, lights white
(and fuck you)
for being so fucking white tonight
my eyes roll back white,
white everywhere, lips white,
words white, lies cold as the
white ice

Yeah,
and fuck you for
being so fucking white tonight
we were always as hot as the white light
and cold as the white ice
but tonight, tonight I've passed
the point of no return
I won't be turning ‘round again

I was so blinded by your eyes
So blinded by those white lights
And dust is now what you’ve become
No longer such a fucking bright white light
And I can see further then I ever saw

The walls white, skies white,
nights white, lights white
(and fuck you)
for being so fucking white tonight
my eyes roll back white,
white everywhere, lips white,
words white, lies cold as the
white ice

Yeah,
and fuck you for
being so fucking white tonight
we were always as hot as the white light
and cold as the white ice
but tonight, tonight I've passed
the point of no return
I won't be turning ‘round again

I was so blinded by your eyes
So blinded by those white lights
And dust is now what you’ve become
No longer such a fucking bright white light
And I can see further then I ever saw


The walls white, skies white,
nights white, lights white
(and fuck you)
for being so fucking white tonight
my eyes roll back white,
white everywhere, lips white,
words white, lies cold as the
white ice

your white eyes,
you rolled back fucking eyes
They wont ever be falling on me again tonight

The walls white, skies white,
nights white, lights white
(and fuck you)
for being so fucking white tonight
my eyes roll back white,
white everywhere, lips white,
words white, lies cold as the
white ice
