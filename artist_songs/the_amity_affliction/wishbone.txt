My life is a broken mirror
Forever picking up the pieces
My will is broken
I'd give anything to defeat this

A pill to make me smile, a pill to help me sleep
A drink to calm the nerves that keep me feeling weak
I'm meant to be a man but I can't carry everything

On my own, counting on a wishbone
Oh I sink so low
Tell me, will I ever make it out of here
On my own, counting on a wishbone
Where did I go wrong?
And tell me, will I ever make it out of here
On my own
On my own, counting on a wishbone
On my own

My life is a broken record
Failure on repeat
My mind is a crippled horse
Running circles around me
My self worth has faded
And I have become jaded
I look at the world with tired eyes
Filled with hatred

A pill to make me smile, a pill to help sleep
A drink to calm the nerves that keep me feeling weak
I'm meant to be a man but I can't carry everything

On my own, counting on a wishbone
Oh I sink so low
Tell me, will I ever make it out of here
On my own, counting on a wishbone
Where did I go wrong?
And tell me, will I ever make it out of here
On my own

Should I just set myself on fire?
Burn
I won't make it out alive
I won't make it out alive
The world keeps on turning
My mind keeps on burning
Burn
I won't make it out alive

I'm meant to be a man but I can't carry everything

On my own, counting on a wishbone
Oh I sink so low
Tell me, will I ever make it out of here
On my own, counting on a wishbone
Where did I go wrong?
And tell me, will I ever make it out of here
