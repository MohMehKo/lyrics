Undeserving…this morning will take my arms and wrap them twice 
And steal every tear from my, from my eyes

This morning will take my arms 
And wrap them twice around my body
And steal every tear from 
Every tear from my eyes

This morning will take my arms and wrap them twice 
And steal every tear from my, from my eyes

Undeserving of these arms…
Undeserving of your embrace…
This morning will go down 
As one of the worst, in the cold comfort of my room

This night is young 
Even though the stars have followed their paths 
Across the night across the night sky
This night has warmed my heart

This night is young 
Even though the stars have followed their paths across the night sky
This night has warmed my heart
And now as my lips are still burning hot from your touch
I close my eyes in anticipation of the dreams 
That are sure to follow your departure
This night and every other belong to you…
They belong to you 

I close my eyes…this morning will take my arms and wrap them twice 
And steal every tear from my, from my eyes
This morning will take my arms and wrap them twice 
And steal every tear from my, from my eyes
