I've spent my life down
In the depths of an enigmatic mind
Where the water turns to black
It's there alone I spend my time.
Try to see my own reflection
Try to divide
Myself in equal parts
For every heart I've left behind.

For every heart I've left behind

But my heart it isn't such
Such a lonely hunter
(Such a lonely hunter)
It's just trying to stay afloat
And keep from going under
(Keep from going under)
'cause the steps that I seem to take
(To take)
They just won't give me the time
(No time)
The time to pull myself together time to hit rewind

It's where the root of all my evil lies
Where it digs still ever deeper
Where you'll eventually find my heart
The heaviest of heavy sleepers
It's in the darkness and the guilt
And all the heartbreak blood I've spilt
It's there you'll find me hiding out
In the darkness sitting still

I'm sick so sick
Just sick and tired
Of trying to believe
In every lie
There are no hearts
Not even fucking mine

Just black tar pits
And empty eyes.

But my heart it isn't such
Such a lonely hunter
(Such a lonely hunter)
It's just trying to stay afloat
And keep from going under
(Keep from going under)
'cause the steps that I seem to take
(To take)
They just won't give me the time
(No time)
The time to pull myself together time to hit rewind

I've been searching,
For something,
Some semblance
Of myself
But I've
Left that behind,
Always searching
For myself and hoping
That I'll like what I find.

But my heart it isn't such
Such a lonely hunter
(Such a lonely hunter)
It's just trying to stay afloat
And keep from going under
(Keep from going under)
'cause the steps that I seem to take
(To take)
They just won't give me the time
(No time)
The time to pull myself together time to hit rewind

The time
To hit
Rewind
