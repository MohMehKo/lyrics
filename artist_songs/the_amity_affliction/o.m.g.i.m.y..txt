Oh my god I'm missing you

Oh my god I'm missing you

Out my window, now the world is painted
Perfectly in blue
Time is moving slowly
And my heart searches only for you
In the reflections on the water
In the movement of the leaves
Under the stones by the river
In the shade beneath the trees

My heart will keep on searching
I heard your name sail on the breeze
I turned my head to catch your shadow
But there was nothing there for me

My heart is breaking slowly
Oh my god I'm missing you
I've been searching out the window
In my world of pallid blue
And I keep checking my shadow
In an empty room
My heart is breaking slowly
Oh my god I'm missing you

Oh my god I'm missing you

Oh my god I'm missing you

The miles stretched between us
They're getting hard to bear
And more and more I find myself
Lost in melancholy stare

My heart will keep on searching
I heard your name sail on the breeze
I turned my head to catch your shadow
But there was nothing there for me

My heart is breaking slowly
Oh my god I'm missing you
I've been searching out the window
In my world of pallid blue
And I keep checking my shadow
In an empty room
My heart is breaking slowly
Oh my god I'm missing you

Do I surrender to the blue?
Because I'm drowning without you
Spend my time staring at the sun
Just waiting to come undone
The sound of static in my head
My heart is heavy, limbs are lead
Sick of living in a world so cold
I can, I will, I still stay gold

I know I'm doing the right thing
This is where I'm meant to be
{But} I've been gone far too long now
I just want you here with me

My heart is breaking slowly
Oh my god I'm missing you
I've been searching out the window
In my world of pallid blue
And I keep checking my shadow
In an empty room
My heart is breaking slowly
Oh my god I'm missing you

Oh my god I'm missing you

Oh my god I'm missing you

Hello, its me, again. I know I shouldn't have called but I really didn't know who else to turn to. Remember last time we talked? You said we were both fucked up, you said you understood because you were fucked up too. I just, I just wanted to speak to you before - well I think you know what I'm saying. If you're there please pick up, please. Just for a minute, please.
