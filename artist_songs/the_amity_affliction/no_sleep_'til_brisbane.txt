I know I stood there, singing to you
Please don't ever feel alone
And please don't dream of never heading home
But truth be told I've struggled just like you

Black hearts will sing tonight
Open your arms and let us fly tonight
Fly tonight
And when it's all said and done
You know we'll be alright
Black hearts will sing tonight

I've lived my life trying not to feel
Like I can't stop myself
From feeling oh so blue
I've fought the darkness
Cold anxiety for so many years
I know your dreams
I know your fears
I know the depths of the earth you wish
Would open up, take you inside
I know the blackness of night

Black hearts will sing tonight
Open your arms and let us fly tonight
Fly tonight
And when it's all said and done
You know we'll be alright
Black hearts will sing tonight

Can't move your limbs
Can't close your eyes
This song is written
For each and every breath you take
Cause we're alive
Cause we're alive
And take those thoughts of suicide
And set them alight
Throw those fucking thoughts out to
Your black heart nights
Your black heart nights

Black hearts will sing tonight
Black hearts will sing tonight
Black hearts will sing tonight
Black hearts will sing tonight

Black hearts will sing tonight
Open your arms and let us fly tonight
Fly tonight
And when it's all said and done
You know we'll be alright
Black hearts will sing tonight
