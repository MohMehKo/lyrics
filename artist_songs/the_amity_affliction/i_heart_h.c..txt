I know you feel like you're the only one, 
Like you've had enough, like you should just give up, 
Like you don't give a fuck,

But let me tell you my friends that when it ends it just ends,
There's no afterlife you don't come back from death; [x2]

So when you leave this earth, when your heart stops you'll see,
There's no choir of angels there's no gods to meet.

You leave friends, you leave family, leave lovers, leave home. 
Then you'll be on your own.

So let me tell you my friends that when it ends it just ends,
There's no afterlife you don't come back from death:

So when you leave this earth, when your heart stops you'll see,
There's no choir of angels there's no gods to meet.

There's no afterlife you don't come back from death;
Just know this my friend as you let go of hope,
As you struggle with your life and grip tightly that rope,

So when you leave this earth, when your heart stops you'll see,
There's no choir of angels there's no gods to meet. [x2]

There is love to be found if you'll just open your heart,
There is light to be found when you are lost in the dark,
There are people who'll listen and people who care
And I know this my friend because I too have been there.
There's no afterlife you don't come back from death.
