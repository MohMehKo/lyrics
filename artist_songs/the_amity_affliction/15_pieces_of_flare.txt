I saw the bridge today, I thought I had it burned
Made a stop to memories, I drowned out and had covered
Falling down into the river, where we’re broken and destroyed
And understand I saw the coming of a past I’d left destroyed

I saw the ghost of everyday, of every year I have forgotten, 
And the grief and the confusion
Of a world I’d soon discover
The ghost of myself, is still mourning all the lives I won’t discover, 
Because I buried myself forever

I buried myself, and carved out new existence,
Where the memories were burned, and break all of my wishes,
And now I still pull down myself, and I’m trying to find the bridge, and build the life
And build the life, the life I always wanted
Be no room, with much to give, open my eyes, and take the world, and take a breath
In turgid water, where I’ve hidden away, 
And I set my heart to slaughter
And the past I’ve left destroyed

I saw the ghost of everyday, of every year I have forgotten, 
And the grief and the confusion
The ghost of myself, is still mourning all the lives I won’t discover, 
Because I buried myself forever

Yeah! 

My future, will not, be defined, by my past.
My future, our future.
