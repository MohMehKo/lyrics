This silence just became disconcerting 
And I am more than worried…I…
Try to steal glances through the smoke 
But I…I…find that I’m collapsing on the table amidst it all

Staring at exit signs
Until my eyes bleed green and white 
Staring at exit signs
Until my eyes bleed green and white

Feeling the warmth drain from within
Watching my face contort
In the blood spill 
Watching my face contort

The silence just became disconcerting
And I am more than worried
(I feel the warmth) Worried about 
(Drain from within) The state of 
My severed hands

I guess that I’m…falling out of touch…
I guess that I’m…falling out of touch…

Feeling the warmth drain from within
Watching my face contort
In the blood spill 
Watching my face contort

The silence just became disconcerting
And I am more than worried
(I feel the warmth) Worried about 
(Drain from within) The state of 
My severed hands

I’m still trying to steal stares with glances
Still dying to be so close to…
Severance…Severance
Still dying to be so close
To Severance
I see my face contort

The silence just became disconcerting
And I am more than worried
(I feel the warmth) Worried about 
(Drain from within) The state of 
My severed hands
