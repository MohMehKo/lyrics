[lord infamous]
6 in tha mornin' police kick in my door
Slipped on my lugz
Quickly thugged out the back yo
Jumped the back gate
Cranked the chevy
Then i race
Popped in the deck
A motherfuckin' three 6 mafia tape
I'm crunked off the bump
Pumpin' through my backseat
Speedin' hit the weed
Though the end of the streets of memphis, tennesee
Got my stacks and some bags sittin' in the stash spot
Tatooes on my neck and a hot 40 glock
They got the hunt out for the infamous nigga
Call me scarecrow
Used to slangin' man, but i don't do that no more
I'm feelin' like i'm the most wanted
Every cop is an opponent
In the dash
On my ass, on the cherry buck flash
And i'm real
Man i got to get the fuck out of here

I had to ditch the chevy
Callin' my mafia niggas to scooped me up
The blocks are crawlin' with cops
I can't go down, them slugs bust
I'm runnin' through yards and shit
Tryin' to dodge them tricks
A movin' target
I spotted my nigga out there
On the real, gonna rde with out no flodgin'
He didn't hesistate, we climbed up out my side of town
I told him bout' the drama in the ride and how it went down
I got a lay low cool (??) before i get back in it
Anti-peace and po-police
I beat them with glocks back to the street
I can't get caught, cause the new law say in it "ain't no deals"
I would decease these devil police, therefore i do twenty years
Every nigga aint real they drop a dime to papers
I gotta pull a quick capa before i catch the vapors

12 a-m the next day
Gotta bank the seas
Gotta preacher please (??) throw in the keys
Down to my nigga
Got the passport to get my overseas
Under the palm trees
But you know me a quarter key
But my plan was injured
The silent alarm was triggered
I heard a cop say come out with fuckin' hands up
Nigga now i got to show my prophet da posseness
My only way out was to take me some hostages
They keep on askin' me over and over for demands
I told them back up
Or she got brains on her pants
The gun was to her head, i told them don't make me shoot
But little did i know they had a sniper on the roof
