Yeah, Hypnotize Minds, Three 6 Mafia
Academy Award winners, what?
Chamillionaire, we stronger then ever, for real
The last 2 off, goin', it's goin' down

I stay doe boy, doe, doe, doe boy fresh
Yeah, now what it is, boy?
Doe boy, doe, doe, doe boy fresh
Yeah, now what it is, boy?

Doe boy, doe, doe, doe boy fresh
Yeah, now what it is, boy?
Doe boy, doe, doe, doe boy fresh
Yeah, now what it is, boy?

Another day, another dollar, another night to make a hoe holler
I pop her cherry, then I pop my collar
Pop brand new tags off a brand new clothes
Brush my hair back and kick the hoe out the door

Flip a quarter, see which ride I'm pullin' out the garage
While it's transmitters in the bump of my barge
Pull a pack out as if my body ever sinned
10 o'clock at night but my day just begin

07 Murcielago with the wings out
I usually never drive it but I heard the hoes out
Fresher than a mint leaf, smellin' like a coca leaf
Center of attention, hoe smilin' 'coz they posted

I stay doe boy, doe, doe, doe boy fresh
Yeah, now what it is, boy?
Doe boy, doe, doe, doe boy fresh
Yeah, now what it is, boy?

Doe boy, doe, doe, doe boy fresh
Yeah, now what it is, boy?
Doe boy, doe, doe, doe boy fresh
Yeah, now what it is, boy?

Man, these kids know how I get my grands
Tryna snatch it? Better switch ya plans
Pull a stack out my Dickies pants
And slap a hater with my business hand

Keep a spare for that clip that jams
Money like Mike and a pimp like can
Put some chromes under that big sedan
And I'm pimpin' better than Xzibit can

And then you're impressed of how my hair lookin' Aquafina clear
If you don't like it, come dispute it, do your best to disappear
Yeah, you know what it is, don't call me Chamillionaire
Now the world gotta address me as the 'Hustla of the Year'

I demand some respect, I'm demandin' respect
Or I'm commandin' that canon through that dam, that's the chest
Ain't no hustler or another on the planet as fresh
So when I lift up my royal hand, my pinky ring shake your pecks

I stay doe boy, doe, doe, doe boy fresh
Yeah, now what it is, boy?
Doe boy, doe, doe, doe boy fresh
Yeah, now what it is, boy?

My cars inside peanut butter, outside jelly
Flicker 26 is drankin', drankin' with my celly
We takin' real orders, talkin' coke in that telly
We choppin' up the doe like a butcher in the deli

You know that purple kush leave your clothes all smelly
But if you slangin' pounds, then your pockets should be swelly
I'm ballin' 'til I'm fallin' just like that movie 'Belly'
I'm always stayin' strapped for you niggas that be petty

Toe the 9, 9, 9, on the grind, grind, grind
I shine, shine, shine, jewelry blind, blind, blind
The time, time, time, yes, it's prime, prime, prime
I'm takin' no retracts 'coz it's mine, mine, mine, nigga

I stay doe boy, doe, doe, doe boy fresh
Yeah, now what it is, boy?
Doe boy, doe, doe, doe boy fresh
Yeah, now what it is, boy?

Doe boy, doe, doe, doe boy fresh
Yeah, now what it is, boy?
Doe boy, doe, doe, doe boy fresh
Yeah, now what it is, boy?

I stay fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh
I stay fresh, fresh, fresh
I stay fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh
I stay fresh, fresh, fresh

I stay fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh
I stay fresh, fresh, fresh
I stay fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh
