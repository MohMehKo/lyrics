Yeah, we back up in this mothafucka
Prophet motherfuckin' posse hoe
Three 6 mafia, m-child
A whole bunch of mothafuckas
And ready to do this shit
You wanna fuck a hoe
Then wait until you're back
When the war's gone bitch
You better recognize you motherfuckin' suckas
Thinkin' that i'm for the 9-7
Once again, it's on
Bout to pull yo' motherfuckin' ass in bitch
Woow, woow, woow woow woow woo

Now when they comes to the hood
I be like black in my zone
Now when it comes to parts of the body
I got more (??)
In the middle of fashion i got to keep it like rockin'
And people callin' it green
That smoke how much i like it
Again it's up to him
I need to let some shots off
and dj paul with teflon also take that bulletproof off
But when they jump, i pump
To put some murderin' punks
And then i dump all his bodyparts into my trunk

Scarecrow
Play
I'ma terror from the end
I'll watch that body explode
If they retaliate i blast
I think about you won't find them bloody clothes
Kill 'em though
Don't you know
I want to get rid of those faked up hoes
It's the city of memphis
Watch me witness how this nigga unload
Rage make me regularly, force me blood
I feed ya' hot lead slugs and watch you drip like fudge
I'm nuts
You got no crips
You got no heart
You niggas from the start
I want to fill my fucking backyard with your bodyparts

Pimp type ass bitch down with the triple 6
My lexus trunk or viper

Look at the billboard charts
Prophet posse takin' over

Why the fuck you all in my grill,

My lyrics leave you scared to go to sleep,
Sleepin' with the lights on,
Hoe you contious of me,me and about 80 mo' muthafuckaz who comin',

We be the prophet devilish and meanin' click so tight,
M-child orange mound,
Smokin' out evey night...bitch!!!!

Who said he slangin' double keys
Also had a group of bustin' all tall and some like, green ink
What you think
I was tryin' to plan a robbin' spree
So i drove a low key car
Tryin' to fool the streets
Curve after curve
I return tryin' not to swerve
Knowin' by the hour i be chippin' up my bag of herbs

Till the nigga pulled his car to the side and stopped the run

Slugs i will pump at your gut
Scan from the killa klan kaze

The game of names
Now which, which one would you choose
Which ever you choose you lose, you lose
