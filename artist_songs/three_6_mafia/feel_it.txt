Going have a bar

Stumbling to the car
But i dont wanna leave coz its too crunk
These girls got alot of junk in the trunk
Red bar, black bone,white top, mid tone

All on the floor, I gotta get this
Gettin that ass and im sayin

I see her gettin it for free
So it put my money up
Before we bar up
The drinks keep flowing and flowing
She make that booty pop

You know i had to gunna get her up on that we on
Singin in the world, But a singing drunk girl
But break it down down down
To the ground ground ground

Hey
I got stuck like its the first of the month
In the projects just got paid, DJ
Keep it coming Keep on breaking em off and
bring it back just for the hood say
Still spending gwap when the women they fly
Reppin the bottom aint got it no lie
Travel the world in the G4 alot
Poe boy the family and we get it hot
I got the beat when the music is live
Rock to the beat like my name can survive
Give me that heat till we all feel the fire
Im in the streets but the club get me high

Get shine that rock the body
The fellas on the rock that shades bacarri
We do it none stop get on bracardi
