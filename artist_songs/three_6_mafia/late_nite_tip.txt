[lord infamous]
Let me just take you somewhere secret
Gonna cut out of the lights down dim, forget all
About your world
We gonna just flow wit what we feel lets share a
Few private thoughts, i'm not just
Out for your sex, let me simp-lify
The things in life that
You find complex, forget what
You heard bout me cause your a
Scarecrow groupie but theres no
Pressure on you cause you know
What you must do

Lets have a drink
And i give
You time to think

This buddah blunt and cut on
This porno bunk here come lounge
Here by my side tonight your
My devils bride and theres a
Freek deep inside have no shame
No need to hide why do you
Keep on blushing get it all
Like thugsta she she must be
Kinda tipsy on this crystal like a gypsy now i got
Her on all fours, bout to break
Down the headboard crash this broad
On through the wall now she howlin like a dog swept poor
We hit the floor and don't quit
Another one ripped
It's just another victim of lord infamous late nite tip

[Chorus x2]
I'm not the type that get involved in long relationships (why)
Takin' trips and buyin' gifts
I'm sorry im' not on that tip (what)
If you want romance
You should just stick who you already with (ok)
If you in that mood you can just hit me on that late nite tip (ooh)

[dj paul]

They wants my crib they wants my kisses, all i done gots my fame
I never recall you askin' your last boyfriend for nathin
But now they be purple on gold

[Chorus x2]

[juicy "j"]
I can't understand why these boss be trippin'
Can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen
Ballin' in my lexus dropped low to the ground
Just a young playa tryin' put my bid in
Freeks wanna trick that be constantly payin'
Not a ghetto thug that be constantly layin'
Rainbow inn or da summer motel
Oh well that's where the juice man stayin'
Gotta have a lady that wanna do what i do
Likes skippin'work or love cuttin' high school
Servin' all the playas in the three 6 mafia
Camcorder on skinny dippin' in the swimmin' pool
Never try to argue
Bother you or fight
Kill a pack of jimmy hand strapped pen real tight
Fillin' alazey all tall and a budlight
Just for your freeks on a moon lite late nite

[koopsta knicca]
Tell me three 6 whose that bumpin that music
Hypnotizin' koop
I tell you who
I'm bout to lose it
Could it be that late night crew tight
Just inside the party
Always kind of lonely
Someone want me, hold me, i say
Come here come near come hear
The koopsta cryin' tears
I can't think positive
When no one cares of how i feel
Relax my mind so tired that i even try to find
I cannot lie though i can ride high late night

[Chorus...till fade]
