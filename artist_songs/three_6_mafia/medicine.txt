[Verse 1]
Girl u sumthin like a ?
Sumthin that I gotta have
Run on out for I cut myself
I gotta check into rehab
Her sex is like a zane
When I need a clean half
Took off the latex
And made me drop my refast
I think it got me under
Hell got me like my head back
It's sumthin bout that thing you do
When you do what you do to the ?
Holdin on my pyrex
Pounds of that guttah mile
Tryna slice that special k
Baby you blow my mind
Girl u impressive
Put me to sleep like different dreams
Sooth me
Girlfriend got the best of me like extacy
You n me
We will always be
Nuthin else compares
N u down like air fares
Stay under me like a wheel chair

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Gotta get with it
Really wanna hit it
So damn thick
I know I split it
Stopped at tha liquor store bought me a fifth
And sum magnun rubbers with the XX fitted
Yea we party
Yea we kick it
Throwin out money like sum might call trickin
I'm just tryna get rid of this cash
I ain't gota job
I work in the kitchen
[Keri Hilson] Work in the kitchen?
Yea I work in the kitchen
I ain't makin rolls or kentucky fried chicken
I'm like a bakery whippin these pies
That's how a dboy make his livin
[Keri Hilson] Make his livin?
Yea makin a livin
Always in the club boy stop pimpin
Baby I keep my head on the low low
Stop real slow by two three women
If you curious
Let's get serious
Don't play games
N don't play delirious
If you thinkin bout makin lil bit of change
[Keri Hilson] Iono bout that
R u on yo period
We can get cheese
N we can get even
You ain't gotta eat with me
You can be a vegan
Look real sexy n work in the streets
N in the summer time
Take off for the season

[Chorus]
