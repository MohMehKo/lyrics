Let's plan a robbery, (a robbery) (lets go...)

See I was on the North, North side in the projects cutterfield
And dats where the the dope dealer nigga really live
See they sold crack, and they sold weed too
They specialize in cooking up the dope food
To get it out, so the junkies can smoke too
But me my nigga, I been smoking out chu
And you ain't you cause yall been cutting up du

Its easy come easy go yall know the rule
HCP motherfucker you know I'll cut loose
And if you got it, I'ma have to touch you
Like knocking on your door and holla trick-or-treat fool
Its Halloween motherfucker, don't let this motherfucker sight you
A robbery to a muderery dance clue
So any way that you want it, I got chu
Its one way hallway nigga, so fuck you

Let's plan a robbery (a robbery)
Let's plan a robbery, (a robbery) (lets go...)

You see good with this yay, but I'm better with these guns

You see good with this yay, but I'm better with these guns

I ran up in his spot, with the glock, his jaw dropped
He knew I came for money and the weight I heard he got
I cracked him in the middle of his face with the tome
Tied his ass up and ransacked his home
I had to rep his bitch cause the hoe was stacked
I fucked her from the back, with my gun to her back
I left up out his crib, with dolla and purple hat
But eventually got caught 'cause of a dick hair

Don't let me find out that you got that dope
Don't let me find out that you snitching on folks
Don't let me find out that you tryna get rich
Ridding round' the fuckin' hood and making fun of niggaz shit
Don't let me find out, feds tap a nigga phone
Don't let me find out, 'cause if I find out its on
Don't let me find out that niggaz selling purple drank
Cuz I'ma rob all dem fools, like I robbed 20 banks

Let's plan a robbery, (a robbery) (let's go...)
Let's plan a robbery (a robbery)
Let's plan a robbery, (a robbery) (let's go...)
Let's plan a robbery (a robbery)

[chorus continues with next part]

You see good with this yay, but I'm better with these guns
I manage dope to collect these funds

You see good with this yay, but I'm better with these guns
I manage dope to collect these funds
