[Chorus x4]
This weed is got me high
So high, so high
This bud is got me high
So high, so high

[dj paul]
Mesmorized by the motherfuckin'
Ya'll niggas odn't get high
Like the dirty three 6 mafia
We smokers there to chain
Give a shot
Of that cocaine to the brain
Gotta get high
Gotta get high
To a motherfuckin' that especially
Don't hear me
But i can keep a smile on my drugs
And you cheap ass thugs
You hoes don't feel me

[crunchy blac]
Watcha got down in your trunk

[juicy j]
Nothin' but leaves and bags of weed
Somethin' to keep you off your feet
Make you crawl around on knees
If you slang a
Then grab a pound
If you a smoker
Fool don't get wild
Are you fucked up
So what

Sip on some beer and black and mild

All i smell like smoke

Yeah that god damn dope

But ain't gon' foll none

Bigger than some of you rappers royalty checks

Quick to get up in your shit
Freaky when i'm high
That's the plan
Now understand my nig
Fuckin' move your man
Cause his ass wanna get with this

Out of the scarecrow
The substance i obtain
Dibe got get me feelin' strange
And crazy

Got me stumblin' and feelin' lazy
I'm staring at some shit

Got plenty of drugs left
And then you know

The swishers
Nigga wit that deep pull
So deep that i cannot remember
And if you really wanna get with the
Three 6 mafia
It's no lie you'll get high
