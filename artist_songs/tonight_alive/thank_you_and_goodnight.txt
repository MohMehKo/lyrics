I'm feeling stuck here,
Break it up, break it up.
A little low here,
Take it up, take it up.
I'm getting bored here,
Shake it up with me, now.

Your ego's salting a game,
And it's coming through.
I'm seeing you're just the same,
But who's blaming you?
Well, I know that you can't help it.

I need to pull myself together,
If we're talking about forever,
Then this room just got a little bit smaller.
And it's not like I signed up for this.
I'm sorry, but I just like to be honest,
You're not my type,
No hard feelings,
Thank you and good night.

I'm lost for words here,
Make it up, make it up.
This is the worst, can I
Shut you up, shut you up.
I gotta chill so bottom's up with me now.
(I gotta chill so bottom's up with me)

You think you're playing a game,
Well, it's playing you.
I think you all look the same,
But who's blaming you?
Well, I know that you can't help it.

I need to pull myself together,
If we're talking about forever,
Then this room just got a little bit smaller.
And it's not like I signed up for this.
I'm sorry, but I just like to be honest,
You're not my type,
No hard feelings,
Thank you and good night.

Well, I just don't know,
I kinda wanna go.
I wonder if she knows, I'm ready to go.

You can't help it (I just don't know)
I can't help (I kinda wanna go)
But wonder why (I don't know if she knows)
Wonder why (I'm ready to go)

You can't help it (I just don't know)
I can't help (I kinda wanna go)
But wonder why (I don't know if she knows)
Wonder why (I'm ready to go)

I need to pull myself together,
If we're talking about forever,
Then this room just got a little bit smaller.
And it's not like I signed up for this.
I'm sorry, I just like to be honest,
You're not my type,
No hard feelings...

Well, I need to pull myself together,
If we're talking about forever,
Then this room just got a little bit smaller.
And it's not like I signed up for this.
I'm sorry, I just like to be honest,
You're not my type,
No hard feelings,
Thank you and good night.
Thank you and good night.
Thank you and good night.
