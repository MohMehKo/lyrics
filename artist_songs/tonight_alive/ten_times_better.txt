I'll take you outside as the rain begins to fall
And you
You quiver inside at the thought of something new
I know this is a little oversaid that I
Can't help but think you do this everytime
And I knew by the way he moved
This is one trap that I could fall into

I am not ok now
But I'll find a way now
I've been here before
But you sure are more more more
Than I bargained for

Everything is ten times better when
When you are next to me
You get the best of me
This is not how I remembered
You go you go
But will we see the end of this?

You know its you my dear
But who does the chasing here?
You gotta get up
You gotta get up and go
You won't get anything if your too slow

So don't be let astray now
I'll show you the way now
I've been here before
But you sure are more more more
Than I bargained for

Everything is ten times better when
When you are next to me
You get the best of me
This is not how I remembered
You go you go

What do you do when you get that feeling?
What do you do when you can't control yourself now
Yourself now
Do you just let go let go let go
Of all your thoughts now
For just that one kiss
For just that one kiss

Everything is ten times better when
When you are next to me
You get the best of me
This is not how I remembered
You go you go
But will we see the end of this?

I'll take you outside as the rain begins to fall
And you
You quiver inside at the thought of something new
