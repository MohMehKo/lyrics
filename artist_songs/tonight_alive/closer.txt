I cannot tell
Can you tell?
Oh I can't tell
Am I lonely or do I need to be alone?
Tonight, this fight
Between my head and my heart
Its getting heavy now
So I'm just, just begging
Just begging for a breakdown
Sometime real soon
Cause I don't know what else is there left to do?

It's like we just can't win
And everytime we get a little closer
It all caves in

And I just don't know
How do we know?
How do we know when to stop?
Baby don't stop, baby don't stop no
Cause we don't even know
Where to begin
You ask the questions but you aren't listening
So my heart gets heavy with every letter that I write
I can't deny we're losing it
I've got no answers tonight

It's like we just can't win
And everytime we get a little closer
It all caves in

It's like we just can't win
It's like we just can't win
It's like we just can't win
It's like we just can't win

It's like we just can't win
And everytime we get a little closer
It all caves in
It's like we just can't win
We both know we'll never
No we just can't win
