Drowning in self pity, 
It's not exactly a pretty picture you paint.
Oh it's such a shame. 
I hardly ever see you smile anymore,
In fact I'm not even sure who you are, who you are

Girly I'll let you grow up
I'll come back in 5 years.
Maybe then you'll have something to say
That I actually want to hear.

You can't, You can't tell me you're sorry
When you're certainly not.
You can't, You can't tell me not to worry
Cause you're just too hot to handle now,
Because you're just too hot to handle now.

Girly I'll let you grow up
I'll come back in 5 years.
Maybe then you'll have something to say
That I actually want to hear.
Please don't make me throw up,
Cut your whining, cut your tears.
I can't hear through your ego,
So speak up baby come on let's go

One step, you've taken it too far,
Two step, two step with me now.
One step, you've taken it too far.

Drowning in self pity, 
Not exactly a pretty picture you paint.
Oh it's such a shame. 

Girly I'll let you grow up
I'll come back in 5 years.
Maybe then you'll have something to say
That I actually want to hear.
Please don't make me throw up,
Cut your whining, cut your tears.
I can't hear through your ego,
So speak up baby come on let's go.
