Weep for yourself, my man
You'll never be what is in your heart
Weep Little Lion Man
You're not as brave as you were at the start
Rate yourself and rake yourself
Take all the courage you have left
Wasted on fixing all the problems
That you made in your own head

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my...

Tremble for yourself, my man
You know that you have seen this all before
Tremble Little Lion Man,
You'll never settle any of your scores
Your grace is wasted on your face
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck
Now learn from your mother or else spend your days
Biting your own neck

[x2]
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?

Didn't I, my dear?

Ahhhhh......

[x2]
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?

Didn't I, my dear?
