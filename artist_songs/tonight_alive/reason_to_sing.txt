You've gone and tied me up here again
I'm hating on myself for ever letting you in
I lost who I was and just for what you want
I wish I'd decide
I am going out of my mind
I can't stand the thought of this again

I hate how much I'm not myself around you
It screws up my whole day
And you don't have a single price to pay
It's not like me to care for stupid things
It's just what you do to me

At least you give me reason to sing
Woah, Woah
At least you give me reason to sing
Woah, Woah
At least you give me reason to sing

There's not a lot of things I regret
but I'm doing my best just not to remember it
One year on, you still haven't moved on
No we can't be friends, everything is different
I can't stand the thought of this again

I hate how much I'm not myself around you
It screws up my whole day
And you don't have a single price to pay
It's not like me to care for stupid things
It's just what you do to me

At least you give me reason to sing
Woah, Woah
At least you give me reason to sing
Woah, Woah
At least you give me reason to sing

Maybe we weren't meant to fix this
Maybe we weren't meant to fix this
Maybe we weren't meant to fix this
Give me a reason to, give me a reason to

Woah, Woah
Woah, Woah

I hate how much I'm not myself around you
It screws up my whole day
And you don't have a single price to pay
It's not like me to care for stupid things
It's just what you do to me

At least you give me reason to sing
Woah, Woah
At least you give me reason to sing
Woah, Woah
At least you give me reason to sing
Woah, Woah
At least you give me reason to sing
Woah, Woah
