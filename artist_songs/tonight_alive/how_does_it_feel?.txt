Waking up to a nightmare
How the hell did I get here
Giving in to my worst fear
Tell me when it ends

I was weak when you found me
Started off like a good dream
Built your walls up around me
Now they're closing in

Let me go...

How does it feel?
How can you say?
That I'm the only one
You only want your way
Nothing is real
Lost in the world that you create
How does it feel?

I guess I should've seen the signs
Can't believe I believed the lies
Always right in your own mind
Now I'm in too deep

I was caught up in the mystery
You were running from your history
Tangled up in a memory
Tell me how you sleep

Let me go...

How does it feel?
How can you say?
That I'm the only one
You only want your way
Nothing is real
Lost in the world that you create
How does it feel?

How does it feel?
And how does it, feel?

You can't hold me
Can't control me
Now I'm waking
Your world is breaking

How does it feel
How can you say
That I'm the only one
You only want your way
Nothing is real
Lost in the world that you create
How does it feel?

Tell me how does it feel?
I can't stand you in my sight now
I like it better when I bite down
Tell me, how does it feel?
