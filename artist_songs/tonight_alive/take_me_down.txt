I don’t have a lot to say
I’m short on my words today
But either way you should know
You wont get away to easy this time

You’ve got another thing coming if you think your coming over tonight
It’s never going to be fun when you just try to hard to make it right

Take me down
Bring me down with you, 
you know what to do
C’mon baby, break me out 
We can run away
Nothing left to say
But I want you to know that I need you now
I know that nothing will bring us down

Well I don’t mind you under my skin
Watch life slip out and  love seep in
You’ll never know how much I have to show
With time you’ll learnt to let it go

You’ve got another thing coming if you think your coming over tonight
It’s never going to be fun when you just try to hard to make it right

Take me down
Bring me down with you, 
you know what to do
C’mon baby, break me out 
We can run away
Nothing left to say
But I want you to know that I need you now
I know that nothing will bring us down

So why won’t you,

Take me down
Bring me down with you 
You know what to do
Common baby, break me out 
We can run away
Nothing left to say
But I want you to know that I need you now
I know that nothing will bring us down
