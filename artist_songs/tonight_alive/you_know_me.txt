This is not something I'm proud of
Not something I admit out loud but lately, 
We fight and I'm not sure what about

So don't ask me why I didn't call
And don't pretend like I don't care
When it's not like that at all

You know you know me
Why are we fighting about being lonely?
I am only 20 quick minutes away
And I am holding onto the fact that I'll see you in the morning
Sweet dreams my dear

No I won't let you say sorry
'Cause I've never been more wrong
To make you worry, I messed up
I dragged it on

So when I ask you why you didn't call
It's not that I don't think you care
No it's not like that at all

You know you know me
Why are we fighting about being lonely?
I am only 20 quick minutes away
And I am holding onto the fact that I'll see you in the morning
Sweet dreams my dear, good thing tomorrow is here

Sweet dreams my dear, good thing tomorrow is here, 
Sweet dreams my dear

You know you know me
Why are we fighting about being lonely?
I am only 20 quick minutes away
And I am holding onto the fact that I'll see you in the morning
Sweet dreams my dear, good thing tomorrow is here
