It takes me writing a song
To know that I took it all in
It could be the best day of my life
Wouldn't be done till I sing
Oh and it's not that I like to boast
Not that I've got the most
Memorable of things to say
I don't want to forget the way
I feel in this moment

Cause here I am fearless
Here I am weightless
Here I am unbreakable
Here I am the greatest

It takes lifetimes for some
To know what they're really here for
Consider me a lucky one
Known since the day I was born
Oh and it's not like I would run around
And speak with my voice up loud
I am happiest when I'm
Surrounded by the best of my friends
And that's as simple as it gets

Cause here I am fearless
Here I am weightless
Here I am unbreakable
Here I am the greatest

Here I am soaring
Here I am flying
My love unconditional
Happiness undying

Ooh ohh [x4]

Nothing you could do
Nothing you could say
I am here at one
My light will never fade
And all that time I needed this change

It takes lifetimes for some
To know what they're really here for
Consider me a lucky one
Known since the day I was born

Cause here I am fearless
Here I am weightless
Here I am unbreakable
Here I am the greatest

Here I am soaring
Here I am flying
My love unconditional
Happiness undying
