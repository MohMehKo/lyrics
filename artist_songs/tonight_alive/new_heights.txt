Lately I've noticed it's harder to lie here alone
(I need you with me, I need you here by my side)
But when you come back, know you'll find me here
(I'm waiting)

I don't think I could set a scene 
Or do justice for the way I feel right now
I don't believe it for a second
Have you fallen asleep?
Cause I'm falling asleep
And I'm falling more for you
I'm not even here - I'm inside this song with you
Take me now - I'll take you to

A new height we'll be flying
We'll make it without dying
Baby believe in me

Woah oh woah oh oh
Get up and sing along
Cause this means more
Than anything we've known before
And I, I won't last
This is what I need - please don't take this from me

I daydream the week away
Time slips through my hands
And I forget my plans
When will this flight land?
I've had enough
And baby don't you know that

We'll be flying
We'll make it without dying
Baby believe in me

Get up and sing along
Cause this means more
Than anything we've known before
And I, I won't last
This is what I need - please don't take this from me

We're so close yet so far
We have come so (far)
And I know that you know
That I know what we need
Please don't pretend you don't know what I mean
For you just know I'd do anything
And for this I give my everything
I would do anything
I would give my everything

Get up and sing along
Cause this means more
Than anything we've known before

Get up and sing along
Cause this means more
Than anything we've known before
And I, I won't last
This is what I need - please don't take this from me
