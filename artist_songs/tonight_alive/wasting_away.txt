And so the sky becomes a dream,
I never dreamt because I'm just too busy
waiting for nothing and wasting away

Don't tell me it's too hard, you were never there from the start
I'm not about to give this up, giving up was never enough (no)

And so the sky becomes a dream,
I never dreamt because I'm just too busy
waiting for nothing and wasting away
And so the sky it watched my dreams,
fall to pieces right in front of me
Coz I'm just too busy waiting for nothing
and wasting away

and I never wished for anything more, than to find what I've been looking for
and I swore to myself I wouldn't lie to myself, how could I let this happen?
so I pull myself aside, take the time to tell myself it's alright,
coz you weren't there to dry my eyes

And so the sky becomes a dream,
I never dreamt because I'm just too busy
waiting for nothing and wasting away
And so the sky it watched my dreams,
fall to pieces right in front of me
Coz I'm just too busy waiting for nothing
and wasting away
