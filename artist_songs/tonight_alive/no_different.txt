Yeah, we've all made mistakes.
We're no different, oh, only by name.
With our own risk to take.
We can trust that we've all felt the same.

But I deserve this, you don't
Please don't blame yourself
I can't say that I won't.
And don't you bring this all down on your head.
Give it to me instead.

I was looking for something to drown out the pain.
But with all the wrong answers it started again.
I learned on that very day,
I just cannot keep running away from myself.
Under a spell dragged myself to hell.

I'm not trying to bring you down.
I'm just talking to myself out loud.
It's not like me to be so down.
Slow down.

I was looking for something to drown out the pain.
But with all the wrong answers it started again.
I learned on that very day,
I just cannot keep running away from myself.
Under a spell dragged myself to hell.

I was someone else
Someone I do not know and
I hated myself
But it's behind me now.

I was looking for something to drown out the pain.
But with all the wrong answers it started again.
I learned on that very day,
I just cannot keep running away from myself.
Under a spell dragged myself to hell.
