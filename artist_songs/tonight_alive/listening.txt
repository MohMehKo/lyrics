(You listening? Are you listening?)

Your eyes are closed
You're asleep, and are you dreaming?
Is this truth we know
Even the truth at all,
We're only breathing

Naive minds for naive lives,
We don't have nine lives,
Open your eyes
The only chance you get,
Is here tonight

We all have hearts that beat
You're nodding, but are you listening?
Your lips move,
No one makes a sound
You listening?
Are you listening?

Our eyes they cannot see,
They're wasted on people just like me
I've been blind for too long,
I thought I knew my right from wrong
But now it only seems letting myself down
Isn't just in my dreams
You'll have to be true to yourself,
Then you'll see

That we all have hearts that beat
You're nodding, but are you listening?
Your lips move,
No one makes a sound
You listening?
Are you listening?

We all have to believe,
That it's easier to dream, so
Your lips move,
No one makes a sound
You listening?
Are you listening?

It's a little bit of give,
And a little bit of take
When you're looking for the mark you want to make
It's a little bit of give,
And a little bit of take

Don't be afraid no,
Don't be afraid no
It's just a part everyone gotta go through
Don't be afraid no,
Don't be afraid no

We all have hearts that beat
You're nodding, but are you listening?
Your lips move,
No one makes a sound
You listening? Are you listening?

We've all learnt to believe,
That it's easier to dream, so
Your lips move,
No one makes a sound

You listening? Are you listening? [x3]

Are you, are you listening? [x2]

You listening?
Are you listening?
