I exist with fierce intention
My choice set me free
From every rise, every fall, every lesson
A voice of honesty

I believe in the power of,
I believe in the power of one

Never be one to hide my weakness
I am earth, I am sky and sea
I'll never live like I need forgiveness
I'm the one I was born to be

I can be strong and brave
But I have been lost and afraid
I've learned you can't choose
There's pain in the truth sometimes
But I've never learned to lie

I will live with my mind wide open
Lift the anchor and drift away
I will love like I've never been broken
Take a risk, I'm not ashamed

I believe in the power of

I can let go of what's gone
But I have held on too long
I've learned you can't choose
There's pain there's pain in the truth sometimes
But I've never learned to lie

I'll never regret
Never learned to hide from hurt
And hope that I forget
But if I crash and burn
The one thing I've learned
It all made me who I am
