I can't see through the stars in my eyes.
And I don't recall breathing steady, ever since you've been in my life.
So, let me catch my breath, before you steal it once again.
I should be dead by now.

I swear it, on my heart you know I wear it on my sleeve,
For everyone to see that I am yours and you belong to me.

And nothing in this world could ever make me this happy.
So, don't fall asleep (don't fall asleep)
I'm yours to keep (I'm yours to keep)
And from here on in, I'm giving it everything.

Cause, nothing compares to what we share.
I don't have a care in the world.
Cause even if it all came crashing down,
As long as you're around,
I'll be safe and sound.

And I'm dying to know what it is that you're thinking.
And I'm desperate to know why it is that I'm sinking,
So deep beneath my sheets.
And I'm struggling to find sleep.
Cause I've been retracing the steps that we took,
Remembering the way that you held me as I stood in the rain,
And I knew that I would never be the same.

So, don't fall asleep (don't fall asleep)
I'm yours to keep (I'm yours to keep)
And from here on in, I'm giving it everything.

Cause, nothing compares to what we share.
I don't have a care in the world.
Cause even if it all came crashing down,
As long as you're around,
I'll be safe, yeah safe and sound. 
Safe and Sound. 

You've turn my life around.
So far off the ground.
Pick me up, I'm falling down!

And it's all because of you.
And I don't know what to do.
I'm falling in, I think I'm falling in love with you.

Because, nothing compares to what we share.
I don't have a care in the world.
Cause even if it all came crashing down,
As long as you're around,
I'll be safe and sound.

Yeah, I'll be,
Yeah, yeah, I'll be safe,
Yeah, I'll be safe,
Cause even if it all came crashing down, down
Cause even if it all came crashing down, down
Cause even if it all came crashing down,
As long as you're around,
I'll be safe and sound.
