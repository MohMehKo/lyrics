And it feels like I haven't seen you in days
And it feels like I'll never see you again

And it only goes to show you never really cared
Why should I have to pretend you're ever there?
It only goes to show you don't know

But I don't need a cure - this is not a disease
I'm not even sure why I'm down on my knees
And I don't need your fix no it's not what it seems
I'm not addicted baby in your dreams

Listen to my heart, listen to my heart beat
And your heart drop from the rooftop down to the street
(So pretty baby don't you wanna go, wanna go?)
Come on and tell me cause I gotta know, gotta know
Listen to my heart, listen to my heart beat
Then you'll finally know how much you mean to me
You never show oh and you'll never know
Can't stop, can't breathe heart drops

And you don't know what you do to me baby
And I'll never quite understand why
Understand why - having a hard time
If this is it -really it- then prove it to me
If this is it -really it- then prove it to me

Listen to my heart, listen to my heart beat
And your heart drop from the rooftop down to the street
(So pretty baby don't you wanna go, wanna go?)
Come on and tell me cause I gotta know, gotta know
Listen to my heart, listen to my heart beat
Then you'll finally know how much you mean to me
You never show oh and you'll never know
Can't stop, can't breathe heart drops

And in case you're wondering where I've been
I've been here without you
And by any slim chance that you care if I'm happy
Well I'm so much more without you

But I don't need a cure this is not a disease
I'm not even sure why I'm down on my knees
And I don't need your fix - no its not what it seems
I'm not addicted baby in your dreams


Listen to my heart, listen to my heart beat
And your heart drop from the rooftop down to the street
(So pretty baby don't you wanna go, wanna go?)
Come on and tell me cause I gotta know, gotta know
Listen to my heart, listen to my heart beat
Then you'll finally know how much you mean to me
You never show oh and you'll never know
Can't stop, can't breathe heart drops

And it feels like I haven't seen you in days
And it feels like I'll never see you again
