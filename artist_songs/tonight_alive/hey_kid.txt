And we've been waiting for this weekend to come along
For what seems, seems like forever
And I don't care what you've been thinking
But I'll be stoked with just one night spent together
Yeah, can I please have just a minute of your time
To clear out the things that you'd gladly hide

So let's run till we drop can you hear the sound
Of the night falling deep all around us, yeah
So we keep running till we've hit the wall that
We put up now
Go I don't want them to hear your name
The boy left and took everything
But never wanted to hold on

Will it be over once I close my eyes
Why begin if we'll hit the finish line
In a month or two
No that just won't do
That just won't do
That just won't do

So let's run till we drop can you hear the sound
Of the night falling deep all around us, yeah
So we keep running till we've hit the wall that
We put up now
Go I don't want them to hear your name
The boy left and took everything
But never wanted to hold on

Sing this girl to sleep for the last time
Love the way he sings to you
Hear the sound of my heart breaking
Now's all that we've got
Don't look back I'll fight for you
For you

So let's run till we drop can you hear the sound
Of the night falling deep all around us, yeah
So we keep running till we've hit the wall that
We put up now
Go I don't want them to hear your name
The boy left and took everything
But never wanted to hold on
