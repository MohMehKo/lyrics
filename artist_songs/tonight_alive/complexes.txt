Are you embarrassed of me?
You say that you’re proud, but only when I ask ya
Are you embarrassed of me?
Go on and say it out loud, you know I see right past ya
Oh, you always seem to let me down.

Why can’t you be more like me?
You know I’d do anything to see you smile
Why can’t you be more like me?
I know that I’m gone, but only for a while
Oh, is it something different to what I thought it was?
Oh, are you someone different to the one I thought I loved?
Oh, you always seem to let me down.

Now, you’re saying you’re doing everything you can
Guess it wasn’t enough, it never made you a man
Now, you say you’re leaving everything in my hands
Give it a chance, we’ll never know if you can
Turn around, tell me what you see
Do you remember me? And what we used to be?
It turns out your word is broken now
Cause you always seem to let me down.

Are you embarrassed of me?
They’re laughing out loud, but you don’t try to stop them
Are you embarrassed of me?
You’re shrugging me off, and you act like it’s nothin’
Oh, all I needed was for you to feel the same
Oh, it was always easy for me to be the blame
Oh, you always seem to let me down.

Now, you’re saying you’re doing everything you can
Guess it wasn’t enough, it never made you a man
Now, you say you’re leaving everything in my hands
Give it a chance, we’ll never know if you can
Turn around, tell me what you see
Do you remember me? And what we used to be?
It turns out your word is broken now
Cause you always seem to let me down.

Down, down, down
Down
Down

I wasn’t strong enough
And you didn’t give enough
Well, I needed you
I needed you

No, I wasn’t strong enough
And you didn’t give enough
Well, I needed you
I needed you, you, you

Cause I wasn’t strong enough
And you didn’t give enough
Well, I needed you
I needed you
[x2]

Now, you’re saying you’re doing everything you can
Guess it wasn’t enough, it never made you a man
Now, you say you’re leaving everything in my hands
Give it a chance, we’ll never know if you can
Turn around, tell me what you see
Do you remember me? And what we used to be?
It turns out your word is broken now
Cause you always seem to let me down.
