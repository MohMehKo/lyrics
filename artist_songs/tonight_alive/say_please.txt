I’m not talking to you
I won’t give you anything
I gave my everything already, did ya see?
I don’t owe it to you
'Cause I’m just the same again
But with better manners and the right to be alone, alone
I just wanna be alone

If you’re gonna ask me for my time at least say please
'Cause I’m not how I used to be and these things get to me, oh.
If you wanna break me I’m already on my knees
I didn’t give my love for you to walk all over me, to walk all over me

I’m just trying to be
A little honest here
'Cause the other half of the time I just smile
It’s not like me to be the one
To bite my tongue for a while
And I smile 'cause I’ve got better manners and the right to be alone, alone
I just wanna be alone

If you’re gonna ask me for my time at least say please
'Cause I’m not how I used to be and these things get to me, oh.
If you wanna break me I’m already on my knees
I didn’t give my love for you to walk all over me, to walk all over me

If you’re gonna ask me for my time at least say please, no no
And if you wanna break me I’m already on my knees
I’m on my knees
