And as I'm looking back
On the past two years
It seems like I have conquered every fear
I ever had
or thought would hold me back
but now we're standing on the edge and I just have to ask

I don't regret a thing
And I won't forget a thing
And I didn't once pretend,
Did you?
Did you?

I never felt more free,
I've never been more true
Never thought I'd see today with you
I didn't picture this
I wasn't hoping high
Now I'm reaching for the things I left behind
'cause I'm finally content
And I sure as hell meant all of it

The tears well up and I
Just can't help but smile
I think about the way
This took me by surprise
To see how far, we've come
My only wish
That we would see the sun at the end of all of this and

Is it too proud to say that
I like who we became
And I guess that growing up turned out to be okay

I never felt more free,
I've never been more true
Never thought I'd see today with you
I didn't picture this
I wasn't hoping high
Now I'm reaching for the things I left behind
'cause we're standing on the edge
and its nothing less than perfect
Now I'm finally content
And I sure as hell meant all of it

The water shines
Sings to the sky
The sea-spray
It stings my eyes
If I could stay
I'd stay all night
I'd stay all night

I never felt more free,
I've never been more true
Never thought I'd see today with you
I didn't picture this
I wasn't hoping high
Now I'm reaching for the things I left behind
'cause we're standing on the edge
and its nothing less than perfect
no I couldn't ask for more
yeah every heartache was worth it
now I'm finally content
And I sure as hell meant all of it
