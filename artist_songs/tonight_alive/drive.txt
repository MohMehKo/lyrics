All along
Caught in a battle of right and wrong
'Cause all I ever knew was to compromise, be polite
But will I be biting my tongue for life, no

So I'm gonna drive tonight
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Until we see the light
(No, no, no, no)
Oh, we'll say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no
My way or the highway
I'm gonna drive tonight
Away from the city life

Said I'm gonna drive tonight
Away from the city life

All we know
We're begging for someone to break the mold
'Cause everybody else has forgot we ever had the choice
But if we give in then we missed the point, no

So I'm gonna drive tonight
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Until we see the light
(No, no, no, no)
Oh we'll say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no
My way or the highway
I'm gonna drive tonight
Away from the city life

Woo-hoo ooh, woo-hoo ooh
But I believe in something
They don't understand
Woo-hoo ooh, woo-hoo ooh
I'm leaving here to say
I'm done with you holding me back

So I'm gonna drive tonight
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Until we see the light
(No, no, no, no)

Oh we'll say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no
My way or the highway
I'm gonna drive tonight

So I'm gonna drive tonight
Until we see the light
'Til we see, 'til we see, 'til we see the light
Oh we'll say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no
My way or the highway
I'm gonna drive tonight
Away from the city life

So I'm gonna drive tonight
Away from the city life
