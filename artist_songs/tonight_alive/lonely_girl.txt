Lonely girl, you lost the only thing you loved
Nothing that you have is ever good enough
And I won't be the one to keep you safe
And I won't be the one who stays the same

You got a lot of nerve and
Looks like the tables turning
And now you're wishing me well like you miss me
You got a dirty tongue and
Looks like the damage done is forever
And it's a long time to miss me
Whoa oh
And it's a long time to miss me
Whoa oh

Lonely girl, it looks like you are out of luck
Tell me how it feels to watch your friends give up
I was on your side
I stood by you
So go ahead and cry it's just like you

You got a lot of nerve and
Looks like the tables turning
And now you're wishing me well like you miss me
You got a dirty tongue and
Looks like the damage done is forever
And it's a long time to miss me
Whoa oh
And it's a long time to miss me
Whoa oh

And I don't feel sorry for you
Sorry for you
'Cause now the tables turning
And now the bridge is burning
It's coming crashing down
Crashing down
Over you [x4]

You got a lot of nerve and
Looks like the tables turning
And now you're wishing me well like you miss me
You got a dirty tongue and
Looks like the damage done is forever
And it's a long time to miss me
Whoa oh
And it's a long time to miss me
Whoa oh no
