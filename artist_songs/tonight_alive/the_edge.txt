You said you'd stay, I said I'd wait
All those words we spoke in vain
I still recall the bitter taste
I guess some things never change

And then I think of yesterday
And every promise that you made
I never thought I'd be
The one that you would break

But I will fight until the day the world stops turning
And they will fall to ashes, I will just keep burning

But tonight I need you to save me
I'm too close to breaking, I see the light
I am standing on the edge of my life
Standing on the edge of my life
Standing on the edge

This is how it all turns out
You're the hero, I'm left out
I should've known you couldn't stand
Up for me and be a man

I still have dreams of you at night
I can't tell the dark from light
I never thought I'd be
The one you'd leave behind

But I will fight until the day the world stops turning
And they will fall to ashes, I will just keep burning

But tonight I need you to save me
I'm too close to breaking, I see the light
I am standing on the edge of my life

With each step I hold my breath
And I'm tangled in your spiderwebs
I call out but I fall
And I wonder if you ever cared at all

But I will fight until the day the world stops turning
And they will fall to ashes, I will just keep burning

But tonight I need you to save me
I'm too close to breaking, I see the light
I am standing on the edge of my life

Standing on the edge of my life
Standing on the edge of my life

I am standing on the edge of my life
