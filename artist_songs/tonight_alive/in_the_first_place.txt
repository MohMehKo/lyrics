You used to like it when I cried, you said that.
You knew I loved you, but this feels like a setback.
I know I need to control myself, but I can't.
I wish that I could take it all back.
If you don't want to see my tears,
Don't give me reason to:

Cry, I want nothing more than you tonight.
I'm falling even faster.
I don't wanna say goodbye,
But you insist we have to.
Why are you surprised, that this is what we've come to?
Why are you surprised?

Why are you talking to me like I'm a stranger?
Why is it so hard to say that we're in danger?
How can we kiss and make up,
But later find ourselves in the same place two days later?

I love you more than ever,
And we swore we would never,
Do this, well I don't wanna do this
Give each other reasons to:

Cry, I want nothing more than you tonight.
I'm falling even faster.
I don't wanna say goodbye,
But you insist we have to.
Why are you surprised, that this is what we've come to?
Why are you surprised?

Well, I guess it's only fair, to take half the blame.
It's not like it was anyone's fault in the first place.

It's not like it was anyone's fault in the first place.
In the first place.

Well, I don't want to cry.
I want nothing more than you tonight.
I'm falling even faster.
I don't wanna say goodbye,
But you insist we have to.
Why are you surprised, that this is what we've come to?
Why are you surprised?
