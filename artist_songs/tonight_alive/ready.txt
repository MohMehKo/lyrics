So I'll climb the wall into your bedroom
Will I find you at home
Will I find you alone
Or will I turn up to find you
Breathing to the radio
Holding your pillow
Just like you do
This one last time
Just try it my way
You take the left road
I'll take the right
There's no time left to pretend
I don't wanna be the girl
That's easy to forget

Were you ever
Were you ever the right thing
For me now and time's past
I could never
I could never say
That we were meant to last

Are you really ready for this
I'm not sure if you really are
But I am willing to wait
Until you're ready

Now its just about to get a little hotter in here
Can you deal with it
Can you deal with it
Grab my hand and run through the street
We'll take a look back and smile at our bare feet

Were you ever
Were you ever the right thing
For me now and time's past
I could never
I could never say
That we were meant to last

Are you really ready for this
I'm not sure if you really are
But I am willing to wait
Until you're ready

This is something that I can't explain
It just gets in my head
It just gets in my head
When I get into your room
My mind turns over and over again
This is something that I can't explain
It just gets in my head
It just gets in my head
When I get into your room
My mind turns over as I wait for you
I wait for you, I wait for you
I wait for you, I wait for you
For you, for you, for you

This is something that I can't explain
It just gets in my head
It just gets in my head
This is something that I can't explain
It just gets in my head
(I wait for you, I wait for you
I wait for you, I wait for you
For you, for you, for you)

So are you really ready for this
I'm not sure if you really are
But I am willing to wait
Until you're ready
Are you really ready for this
I'm not sure if you really are
I saw that look in your eyes
I think you're ready
