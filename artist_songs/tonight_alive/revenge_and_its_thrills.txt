Keep your back against the wall
Well, is this a face that looks like its sorry for you? No!
I wouldn't care which side of the grass your on
As long as your out of my way

I will not be still, I will not be silent
These images of you become violent
And I'm searching for a reason not to let myself go

On you,
Well believe me, its not the first time I've wanted to
I've just being waiting for the right chance to hold you
Still not hold your hand but, hold you to the flames and watch you dance

So now we're in business
And I cant stop my heart from racing
These last few steps before the door
Oh, I can almost taste it

The taste of sweet, sweet, sweet revenge
Come closer my friend
So I can
Now I can let myself go

On you,
Well believe me, its not the first time I've wanted to
I've just being waiting for the right chance to hold you
So not hold your hand but, hold you to the flames and watch you dance
Watch you dance

Quietly (Between You and I)
I'm suffocating here tonight
Quietly (Between You and I)
I'm suffocating here tonight

Let it go on you,
Well believe me, its not the first time I've wanted to
I've just being waiting for the right chance to hold you
Still not hold your hand but-

Let it go on you,
Well believe me, its not the first time I've wanted to
I've just being waiting for the right chance to hold you
Still not hold your hand but, hold you to the flames and watch you dance
