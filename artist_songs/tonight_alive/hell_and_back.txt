Been trying to laugh it off
I wrote down a thousand songs
Wish I could say the things I wanna say out loud
But you said, “I don’t know you,
I don’t know you anymore.”
No…
And my girl, she said, “Shake it off.
You won’t breathe till you break it off.”
We’ll run around and act like we are free
Don’t let it bring you down, no, no, see?
There’s no use in feeling low
No…

Cause it was the heaviest rain I ever felt on my skin
It was the heaviest place that I have ever been in
As the walls crashed down I felt it slip away
Cause I went to hell and back just to be where I am today
I went to hell and back just to be where I am today
I went to hell and back just to be where I am today.

So I packed up a bag and went
Two months in the sun I spent
I woke up everyday and smiled
Because I wanna be alive, well don’t you?
There’s no use in feeling low
No…
But I never let myself down
So bad, so bad
But I never thought I’d have
The things I have, I have, that I have

Cause it was the heaviest rain I ever felt on my skin
It was the heaviest place that I have ever been in
As the walls crashed down I felt it slip away
Cause I went to hell and back just to be where I am today.

It was the heaviest rain I ever felt on my skin
It was the heaviest place that I have ever been in
As the walls crashed down I felt it slip away
Cause I went to hell and back just to be where I am today
I went to hell and back just to be where I am today
I went to hell and back just to be where I am today.
