I love you in the light, I love you in the dark
and my mind has been made up
because you threw the sparks
that set my heart on fire
and now the stars are falling from the sky
they're on fire and fall straight into your eyes (your eyes)

I am Invincible, as long as I'm in love with you
I am Invincible, there is nothing we cannot do

Missing you everyday-it's not enough for me
we make it so hard for ourselves so easily
and it's funny how the one thing that makes me crazy
is the same that keeps me sane
my minds a million miles away, but nothing ever changes
no never change

I am Invincible, as long as I'm in love with you
I am Invincible there is nothing we cannot do

Your arms are my home,
and I've been homesick for oh so long
So bring me back home,
back where I, back where I belong
