Come on, come on, pick me up
Go on, go on, let me down
You couldn't tell me if I asked you
"Do you still want me around?"
Come on, come on play your games
Go on, go on, say my name
You won't, you won't stay the same
And don't you know it's just not like me to wait?

Cause you give me your reasons
But I've heard them all before
This is it, and I'll admit that

I breakdown, I breakdown when I can't see you
I breakdown, I breakdown when you don't call
And I've told myself a thousand times
That if you left I'd be alright and
I breakdown, I breakdown if I can't see you tonight

Come on, come on, keep me here
Go on, go on, watch my tears
Go on, go on, say goodbye cause I know, I know it won't be the last time
Go on and I'll watch you go
Go on, go on, I just hope you know
It's a slim to none chance that I'll be here when you get home

Cause you give me your reasons
But I've heard them all before
This is it, and I'll admit that

I breakdown, I breakdown when I can't see you
I breakdown, I breakdown when you don't call
And I've told myself a thousand times
That if you left I'd be alright and
I breakdown, I breakdown if I can't see you tonight

I really don't wanna talk it out
There's nothing left here to fight about or cry about
So don't misunderstand me, I'm giving up
I really don't wanna see your face,
When you look at me that way like it's a game
I'm really not OK but I won't

Breakdown and breakdown if I can't see you
No I won't breakdown and breakdown if you don't call

I breakdown, I breakdown if I can't see you
I breakdown, I breakdown if you don't call
And I've done this all a thousand times
So now I know I'll be alright and
I breakdown, I breakdown but I won't
I can't stop myself now but I won't
Breakdown and breakdown if I can't see you tonight
