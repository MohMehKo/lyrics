Stop you've got it all wrong
I should've seen it from the start
You were never gone in my direction
But you were known for
The coldest heart that ever lived
But I swear I'll make it through

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
I lift you up, I lift you up
Oh, oh, oh
You just bring me down

Now we go on
Can't you leave
You're sleeping till tomorrow
Stay here
We'll find a way to make it work
A way to make the hurt fall away
Cause this is all we got

Let's keep it undiscovered
Just lay here under covers
Laugh it off now
Even though I know
You're gonna break my heart
And tear it right apart
Can't you just pretend to love me
Like there's no one else above me

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
I lift you up, I lift you up
Oh, oh, oh
You just bring me down

Now we go on
Can't you leave
You're sleeping till tomorrow
Stay here
We'll find a way to make it work
A way to make the hurt fall away

Down
Now we go on
Can't you leave
You're sleeping till tomorrow
Stay here
We'll find a way to make it work
A way to make the hurt fall away
Down
Now we go on
Can't you leave
You're sleeping till tomorrow
Stay here
We'll find a way to make it work
A way to make the hurt fall away
Cause this is all we got
Cause this is all we got
