I watch the bathwater drain
It’s never looked quite the same
The weight comes back to my body
And I’m hopeless again
I watch the twist and the turns
Distract me from where it hurts
It’s like I’m watching my life
Go past the point of return
Of return

So I switch it off
And I let it go
Cause where I hide
You’ll never know
But when I’m down
You’ll always know
So bathwater hear me now
As I scream out from below

I watch the sun coming up
Over the trees and rooftops
It’s like it’s piercing the sky
I wish it all could just stop
So I can replay this scene
And live like life is a dream
I’m finding this out the hard way
Nothing’s quite what it seems
What it seems

So I switch it off
And I let it go
Cause where I hide
You’ll never know
But when I’m down
You’ll always know
So bathwater hear me now
As I scream out from below

As I scream out from below

I watch the bathwater drain
It never looked quite the same
The weight comes back to my body

So I switch it off
And I let it go
Cause where I hide
You’ll never know
But when I’m down
You’ll always know
So bathwater hear me now
As I scream out from below
