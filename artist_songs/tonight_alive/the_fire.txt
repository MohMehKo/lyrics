Patiently I was waiting
Just waiting for this day to come
To say how much I hated
Those days, yeah each and every one

But I made it out alive
I’m here to say I breathe at least I try
I won’t go without a fight
You can’t stop me

I feel like I died
And went to heaven
And I think I could fly
I’ll take you with me

Blatantly, I resisted
The change I knew I had to make
But the fire still existed
I learn from each of my mistakes

But I made it out alive
I’m here to say I breathe at least I try
I won’t go without a fight
You can’t stop me

I feel like I died
And went to heaven
And I think I could fly
I’ll take you with me

I feel like I died
And went to heaven
And I think I could fly
I’ll take you with me
(Ah...)
I’ll take you with me
(Ah...)
I’ll take you with me
