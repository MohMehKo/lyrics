Don’t come looking for me
I don’t wanna be found
I just wanna be free
So don’t come looking for me
I don’t wanna be found
I just wanna run away and learn to be free

(No, no, no
Go, go, go)

My life, watching it burn
Point of no return
Will I ever learn?
(No, no, no)

Coming over me
Sense of urgency
Think it’s time to leave
(Go, go, go)

And I feel like I could fly

Don’t come looking for me
I don’t wanna be found
I just wanna be free
So don’t come looking for me
I don’t wanna be found
I just wanna run away and learn to be free

Wild and overgrown
I am swallowed whole
The earth takes me home
(Go, go, go)

So adventure happily
Lift the past away from me
I’ll never compromise again
(No, no, no)

‘Cause I feel like I could fly

Don’t come looking for me
I don’t wanna be found
I just wanna be free
So don’t come looking for me
I don’t wanna be found
I just wanna run away and learn to be free

No, no, no
To be free
No, no, no
To be free
No, no, no
I just wanna run away and learn to be free

I am limitless, I am limitless, limitless…
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Don’t come looking for me
I don’t wanna be found
I just wanna be free
So don’t come looking for me
(Don’t come looking, no don’t come looking)
I don’t wanna be found
I just wanna run away and learn to be free

I wanna run away
To be free
I wanna run away
To be free
I wanna run away

I just wanna run away and learn to be free
