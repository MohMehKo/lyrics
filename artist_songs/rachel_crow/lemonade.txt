[Verse 1:]
Playing with the lace on my converse
Thinking of the ways you can get hurt
Saw you with that girl and my heart burst
I'm letting go I'm letting go
Looking at my eyes in the mirror
Contemplating life and I shiver
Cause it's all like a river
Take you up take you down
Take you all the way around again
Yeah, and all the way around again

[Chorus:]
Ooooh oooh oooh
Every things cool
Ooooh oooh oooh
The glass is half full
Too much sun, back in the shade
Life gives you lemons make lemonade.
Ooooh oooh oooh
Everythings cool
Ooooh oooh oooh
Whatcha gonna do?
Four foot one standing on stage
Life gives you lemons make lemonade

[Verse 2:]
My mind don't wanna hear what my heart says
My heart says to my mind mind your business
Always seeing green when the lights big
Can't look back I can't look back
Running out of luck on a Sunday
Good to know that I got a Monday
And it's all kinda funny
You go up you go down you go all the way around again
And all the way around again

[Chorus:]
Ooooh oooh oooh
Every things cool
Ooooh oooh oooh
The glass is half full
Too much sun, back in the shade
Life gives you lemons make lemonade.
Ooooh oooh oooh
Everythings cool
Ooooh oooh oooh
Whatcha gonna do?
Four foot one standing on stage
Life gives you lemons make lemonade

[Verse 3:]
Drink it down, yeah drink it down slowly
Smack it up with some chips and guacamole
Good for you soul-e
Make you feel whole-e
Just a taste and you'll never be lonely
Never never no never be lonely
Drink it down yeah drink it down slowly

[Chorus: (x2)]
Ooooh oooh oooh
Every things cool
Ooooh oooh oooh
The glass is half full
Too much sun, back in the shade
Life gives you lemons make lemonade.
Ooooh oooh oooh
Everythings cool
Ooooh oooh oooh
Whatcha gonna do?
Four foot one standing on stage
Life gives you lemons make lemonade

Drink it down, yeah drink it down slowly.
