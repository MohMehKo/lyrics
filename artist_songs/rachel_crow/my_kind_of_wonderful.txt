My friends ask what I see in him
They don't get it but that's alright
By me
He's not maybe that good lookin'
He's barely as tall as me
But oh oh oh when he says my name
My heart goes boom boom boom
He's my kind of wonderful
My kind of wonderful
My kind of wonderful
And when we're together that's all
That matters

I don't care what you think he's
The only one for me
He's comical, original, I'm so lucky to
Be his girl
I'm in love and I can't lie and I can't
Even tell you why
He's my my my my my kind of wonderful

He's got those geeky glasses and
Worn out clothes but he can beatbox like
You can't even believe
Sweetly awkward and baby's kind of shy
Always seems to say the wrong thing
But oh oh oh when he kisses me my
Heart goes boom boom boom

He's my kind of wonderful
My kind of wonderful
My kind of wonderful
And when we're together that all
That matters
I don't care what you think he's
The only one for me
He's comical, original, I'm so lucky
To be his girl
I'm in love and I can't lie and
I can't even tell you why

He's my my my my my kind of wonderful
My kind of wonderful yeah yeah yeah
Maybe he's not perfect but he's
Perfectly perfect for me and I'll
Shout it from the top of the rooftops
Yeah
He's w-o-n-d-e-r wonderful

Oh oh oh when he kisses me my heart
Goes boom boom boom ohhh
He's my kind of wonderful
My kind of wonderful
My kind of wonderful
And when we're together that's all
That matters

I don't care what you think he's
The only one for me
He's comical, original, I'm so lucky
To be his girl
I'm in love and I can't lie
And I can't even tell you why

He's my my my my my kind of wonderful

He's my my my my my kind of wonderful
