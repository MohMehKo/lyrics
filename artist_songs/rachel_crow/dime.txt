Blame it on the gold and on the silver
Blame it on the love I used to give you
Baby you could never buy no better
Ooh you're gonna pay for this forever

Try to spend my love and now it's broken
'Cause you could never see I was a token
This is who I am, it's time to show it
And now you want me back, you must be joking

Ooh 'cause I'm not just a penny you can pick up off the sidewalk
Not just a penny you can pick up off the sidewalk

I'm a dime, I'm a dime
But I'm not yours
I'm just fine, I'm just fine
Don't you know, don't you know
Say goodbye to this dime
Oh
Had your chance, now I'm gone
And by the time you hear this song
You won't find me in your wallet

Pulled me closer with your wicked magic
You're getting clearer every moment passing
Told me you were faithful, you were classy
Boy I'm looking back and now I'm laughing

Ooh 'cause I'm not just a penny you can pick up off the sidewalk
Not just a penny you can pick up off the sidewalk

I'm a dime, I'm a dime
But I'm not yours
I'm just fine, I'm just fine
Don't you know, don't you know
Say goodbye to this dime
Oh
Had your chance, now I'm gone
And by the time you hear this song
You won't find me in your wallet

Spare the excuses I'm not spare change
Baby I'll take this time to invest in me
Spare the apologies I won't buy 'em
Ooh I dare you to find you another dime

Because I'm not just a penny love
I'm not just a penny you can
I'm not just a penny you can pick up off the sidewalk
Not just a penny love
I'm not just a penny you can
I'm not just a penny you can pick up off the sidewalk

I'm a dime, I'm a dime
But I'm not yours
I'm just fine, I'm just fine
Don't you know

I'm a dime, I'm a dime
But I'm not yours
I'm just fine I'm just fine
Don't you, don't you know love
Say goodbye to this dime
Say goodbye
Had your chance now I'm gone
And by the time you hear this song
You won't find me in your wallet
