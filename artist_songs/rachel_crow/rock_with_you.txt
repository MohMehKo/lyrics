Mann, AND... Rachel Crow! 

Don't turn your back on the sound
Cause I really wanna rock with you boy, 

Walking on through the crowd, 
Familiar faces I see
But there in a corner
You are busy watching me
Now what you wanna do?
Are you just gonna stand there?
Are you gonna shake all you guys
Till the morning breaks out
Let it all, let it all ouuut... 

[Chorus]
Don't turn your back on my sound
Cause I really wanna rock with you boy, 
You better not let me down, yeah
Cause I really wanna dance all night long, yeah

So here we are on the floor
You gotta show me your style
Cause I wanna see you move 
And hold you tight
Now I know it's no slow dance
But I'm looking for a chance 
So just wake up, shape up, find your girl
And go break up

[Chorus]
Don't turn your back on my sound
Cause I really wanna rock with you boy, 
You better not let me down, yeah
Cause I really wanna dance all night long, yeah

[Rap]
Mann!... Can I rap wit'cha, rock wit'cha you?
Can I walk in the building, check the spot with you?
Can I be your man and make you popular
So haters stop with the... hating
I see our future's, clear as binoculars
I'm not mister nice guy
No I'm mister fly guy, slash hipster 
My sister, Rachel Crow... 
He's as cold as last winter
Drop what you doing right now, and dance with us
Get up, the music will make you do it
First one to the dance floor, don't let me beat you to it girl

Come a little closer, so I can feel the air
But know we ain't supposed to
Hair looks so super duper tight
And as long as the speakers are pumping
And the crowd looks like... jumping
We're gonna glide, we're gonna slide
We'll be dancing together til the morning side

[Chorus]
Don't turn your back on my sound
Cause I really wanna rock with you boy, 
You better not let me down, yeah
Cause I really wanna dance all night long.
