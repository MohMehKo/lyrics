Do you ever go to lunch with no one by your side
Cause the moment you arrive they all leave the table
Calling me everything but my name
Need I remind you again just call me Rachel
How would you feel if you running home crying
Lock yourself in your room, don't want anyone to see ya
While everyone's having fun outside, and you're telling yourself

I won't let it get to me no more
I don't wanna feel this way
I can't believe I let it go so far
No no, it's not okay
What do you know about me?
Do you wanna know what I think?
Mean girls, mean girls
I'm a just comb you outta my curls
Mean girls, mean girls
You no longer run my world
Mean girls, mean girls
I'm a just comb you outta my curls

How would you feel every time you go to school
Someone's looking at you weird calling you a loser
All these girls wearing bubble-gum pink
Guess I didn't get the memo
Cause they're laughing at my blue shirt
Well I hope you feeling good about you treating someone you know like a perfect stranger
Cause it's easier than standing by my side
Ohhh
I won't let it get to me no more
I don't wanna feel this way
I can't believe I let it go so far
No no, it's not okay
What do you know about me?
Do you wanna know what I think?
Mean girls, mean girls
I'm a just comb you outta my curls
Mean girls, mean girls
You no longer run my world

Who do you think you are
Loud mouth, cafeteria star
Maybe somebody was cruel to you
So you think that's what you're supposed to do
One day, it might be you
When you need a friend, but you no longer cool
When everyone leaves when you walk in the room
I just hope they forgive you

I won't let it get to me no more
I don't wanna feel this way
I can't believe I let it go so far
No no, it's not okay
What do you know about me?
Do you wanna know what I think?
Mean girls, mean girls
I'm a just comb you outta my curls
Mean girls, mean girls
You no longer run my world
Mean girls, mean girls
I'm a just comb you outta my curls

Mean girls, mean girls
You no longer run my world
