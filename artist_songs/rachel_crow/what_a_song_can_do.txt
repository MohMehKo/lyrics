I feel your heavy heart, saw it from the start
When you walked in the room
The world has got you dragging baby
Tell me what has happen to you, oh yeah
I can see the light, drifted from your eyes
Sorrow on your face
Tears are falling down
And I can see you need some sunshine in your days
And I know a way

Na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na
Yeah, I see you singing along
Your worries are gone, it's true, it's true
So come on sing with me
Na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na
Yeah, I see your light shining through
And that's what a song can do
For you, for you, for you

I know your burden's heavy
I can help you if you let me
Help your mind escape
It won't solve your problems
But I can take you far away, away, away

Na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na
Yeah, I hear you singing along
Your worries are gone, it's true, it's true
So come on sing with me
Na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na
Yeah, I see your light shining through
And that's what a song can do
For you, for you, for you

I'll stand here, hold your hand
Even in the pouring rain
Mhm, oh yeah, and while we're soaking wet
We'll laugh to death until the darkest clouds just float away

[Whistle]

I hear you singing along
Your worries are gone, it's true, it's true
Help me sing

Na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na
Yeah, I see you singing along
Your worries are gone, it's true, it's true
So come on sing with me
Na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na
Yeah, I see your light shining through
And that's what a song can do
For you, for you, for you
Singing la la la la la la la la la la la la.
