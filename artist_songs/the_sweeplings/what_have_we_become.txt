This house 
has many rooms 
filled with dust 
and pieces of you 
Tangled vines 
made there within 
we left the door 
wide open

Ooooh
What have we become
Ooooh
What have we become

Broken glass 
lay on the floor
Shattered body
What do we ignore
The guidance 
Is overgrown 
Leaves have brown 
Hide in the woods

Ooooh
What have we become
Ooooh
What have we become

Truth behind
These 4 walls
Becomes clear
When they're gone
Looking in
Feel their stares
Our mistakes
In no better

Ooooooooh
What have we become [x6]
