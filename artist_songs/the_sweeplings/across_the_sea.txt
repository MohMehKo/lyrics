Follow me down to the shore
We can cast our sail and grab the oars
We could float away and not come back 
Darling if you'd just take my hand

Your fingertips can brush the waves 
Feel the salt in the air against your face 
Freedom is as far as we can see 
Darling if you just come with me
Darling if you just come with me

Oh, just you and me 
Oh, across the sea 
Oh, darling won't you just come with me

Here is where we decide 
By the setting sun and rising tide
If we stay and fade or test our reach 
Darling won't you just come with me
Darling won't you just come with me

Oh, just you and me 
Oh, across the sea 
Oh, darling won't you just come with me

Leave our note in the old oak tree 
Carve it deep so they all can read 
The only thing of us that's left behind 
Are the words we left there in those few lines
