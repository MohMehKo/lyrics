Oh oh, I'm in too deep

Brick by brick
The walls are building all around my feet
Consequences fencing in the truth
They beg and plead

Hush,
What is done is done
Don't say a word
Keep the secret from your tongue

Oh, oh, I'm in too deep [x3]
What I did is killing me

Release me, let me start over again,
and bury it away
Down this coven every moment 
Its my dept to pay

Hush,
What is done is done
Don't say a word
Keep the secret from your tongue

Oh, oh, I'm in too deep [x3]
What I did is killing me

Oh, Oh, Oh

Oh, oh, I'm in too deep [x3]
What I've done, oh, what I've done
What I've done is killing me
