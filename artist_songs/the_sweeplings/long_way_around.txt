Early in the morning while the sunlights dim
All the waking earth is still
Feel the ray of moonlight on our walk back down
Anywhere it leads, I’ll have you here with me

Follow me my dear and know that only I will follow you
To places near or far, give me a place to start
Oh to have you here, promising with every step set down
That we’ll take the long way around, oooo ooooo oooo

In the midst of evening when the day has gone
Light it looms, the shadows long
You and I together leave no path unfound
Together make it through, only me and you

Follow me my dear and know that only I will follow you
To places near or far, give me a place to start
Oh to have you here, promising with every step set down
That we’ll take the long way around, oooo ooooo oooo

Onward down this road, hand in hand we go
Holding tight to what is ours

Follow me my dear and know that only I will follow you
To places near or far, give me a place to start
Oh to have you here, promising with every step set down
That we’ll take the long way around, oooo ooooo oooo
