Floating across the clear blue sky in slow motion
Worries never crossed my mind just perfect
Hanging in this world of silence, all alone up here

On and on just in the air
I’m in free fall down
On and on somewhere out there
Swore I’d never touch the ground

Falling, carry me away, felt it changing
Colors slowly start to fade to nothing
Headed straight into the darkness
How did I get here

On and on just in the air
I’m in free fall down
On and on somewhere out there
Swore I’d never touch the ground

Here out in the open, find me sailing
With the still clouds breaking
Behind where I once was, like they’re waving
Goodbye

On and on just in the air
I’m in free fall down
On and on somewhere out there
Swore I’d never touch the ground
