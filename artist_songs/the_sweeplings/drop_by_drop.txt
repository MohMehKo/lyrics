Sink in under the water and breathe deep
It's getting harder to stay afloat when you hang on
Slowly, slipping in farther and loosing the battle we started
A silence sound envelops me

If I could have opened my eyes so I could see where I'd land, I would've never fallin' for you
There'd be no tears in my eyes, no beating in my chest, as drop by drop fills the sea

Broken, crumbled to pieces and searching, for just one more reason to pull it together and just move on
Miss the heat of the fire as your arms where holding me tight, and all the moments in between

If I could have opened my eyes so I could see where I'd land, I would've never fallin' for you
There'd be no tears in my eyes, no beating in my chest, as drop by drop fills the sea

I've been treading water and have poured out my soul, buried the pieces and let you go

If I could have opened my eyes so I could see where I'd land, I would've never fallin' for you
There'd be no tears in my eyes, no beating in my chest, as drop by drop fills the sea

Sink in, under the water and breathe deep, it's getting hard to stay afloat when you hang on
