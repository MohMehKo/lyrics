Come rest your head little one
There’s nothing to fear anymore
Come rest your head
For there is nothing to fear in these arms

The sun’s gonna shine little one
Run off the night when it does
Come rest your head
For there is nothing to fear in these arms

The dark will whisper evil, oh, no no
Mislead you and deceive, but I’ll tell you no no no

Know that you’re safe little one
There’s no more harm to be done
Come rest your head
For there is nothing to fear in these arms

Just close your eyes, til the morning light
I promise I will be by your side

The dark will whisper evil, oh, no no
Mislead you and deceive, but I’ll tell you no no no

Come rest your head little one
There’s nothing to fear anymore
Come rest your head
For there is nothing to fear in these arms
