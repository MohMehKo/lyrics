Take me by the hand, lead me to a place where
Slowly back and forth, moonlight dances on the water
It's only you and me there, through the rise and fall  

Won’t you hold me while the waves sing us to sleep
Won’t you hold me while the waves rock us gently
Feel the sway beneath our feet, won’t you hold, just hold me

Listen to the hum, of silence getting closer
Feel your every breath, nothings meant to last forever
It's only you and me there, till the darkness calls

Won’t you hold me while the waves sing us to sleep
Won’t you hold me while the waves rock us gently
Feel the sway beneath our feet, won’t you hold, just hold me

Let’s face the dawn together, we’ll brave whatever comes
Let’s face the dawn together, we’ll brave whatever comes
Let’s face the dawn together, we’ll brave whatever comes
Let’s face the dawn together, we’ll brave whatever comes

Won’t you hold me while the waves sing us to sleep
Won’t you hold me while the waves rock us gently
Feel the sway beneath our feet, won’t you hold, just hold me
