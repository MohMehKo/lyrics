Bring on the latest hour, give us the days return
All these shackles beg for home and future shores
Lord bare your mystery we pray for peace divine
And may you be by our side, and may you be by our side

Come now ye horizon to test the waters warmth
Follow the sunset as it curves the orange earth
Run tell your demons there is no where left to hide
And may you be by our side, and may you be by our side

Oh the coming dawn, the coming dawn is calling
Followed by the light even though it’s fading
Oh the coming dawn, the coming dawn is calling

The time is upon us now, our labors found reward
Weight lifted from our hands our faith has been restored
Rest here we weary ones, hold the victory in your sight
And may you be by our side, and may you be by our side

Oh the coming dawn, the coming dawn is calling
Followed by the light even though it’s fading
Oh the coming dawn, the coming dawn is calling

Oh the coming dawn, the coming dawn is calling
Followed by the light even though it’s fading
Oh the coming dawn, the coming dawn is calling...
