My oh my, my oh my, oh my

The morning dew is dry and gone
Heat rises from the hill
You can leave behind most anything
But some you never will

Hear the saw grass singing out
Wind blowing from the east
You can hide the tracks of smaller things
Keep it buried underneath
My oh my, my oh my, oh my

Oh I feel it coming, coming for me
Can’t escape the nights that we’ve been through
Old regrets they never, never let go
My oh my, my oh my how my soul weeps for you

It’s hard liv’n and letting go
When your past is waging war
If I could climb these mountain walls
Leave the battle on the valley floor
My oh my, my oh my, oh my

Oh I feel it coming, coming for me
Can’t escape the nights that we’ve been through
Old regrets they never, never let go
My oh my, my oh my how my soul weeps for you

My soul weeps, things I should have done
My soul weeps, things I can’t outrun
My soul weeps

Oh I feel it coming, coming for me
Can’t escape the nights that we’ve been through
Old regrets they never, never let go
My oh my, my oh my how my soul weeps for you
My oh my, my oh my how my soul weeps for you
