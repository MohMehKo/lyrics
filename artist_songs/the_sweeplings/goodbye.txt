Where there’s smoke there is fire
Fan the flames til the embers burn brighter igniting again
What I’m feeling inside
You’re my light in the dark, blind without you

I’m not willing to lose you
I’m not willing to say goodbye
I’m not willing to lose you
I’m not willing to say goodbye

Give me oceans or canyons
So deep they stretch for millions of miles
I’ll cross any divide,  not a flicker of doubt
No danger I wouldn’t dare, to be with you

I’m not willing to lose you
I’m not willing to say goodbye
I’m not willing to lose you
I’m not willing to say goodbye

Trust me sweetheart I’ll be here
When the star light fades, right alongside you
I’ll bring you back from anywhere
If you’ll do the same, there’s no end here

I’m not willing to lose you
I’m not willing to say goodbye

I’m not willing to lose you
I’m not willing to say goodbye
I’m not willing to lose you
I’m not willing to say goodbye
