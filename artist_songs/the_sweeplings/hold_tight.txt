A memory course
And let go, and let go carried on
A sound so clear
A halo hallow souvenir

But I swear on my pour heart
I won't let me tear apart
Just hold tight
Hold tight
The damage has been done
Lost myself in the liars
Just hold tight

The moment has come
It's pulling, it's pulling me along
The ache I felt
Is over is overall I have

Now I swear on my poor heart
I won't let me tear apart
Just hold tight
Hold tight
The damage has been done
Lost myself in the lies
Just hold tight

Just hold tight
Hold tight
The damage has been done
Lost myself in the liars
Just hold tight
