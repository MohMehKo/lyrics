Carry me home when the light in my eyes does fade
Carry me home when the shadow comes to take me away
Lay down my bones knowing I'll be in a better place
Release my soul, carry me home

Carry me home there's no sorrow down in the ground
Carry me home don't you weep for I am freedom bound
Lay down my bones there is peace within the light I've found
Release my soul, carry me home

Oooooooo...

Carry me home when the light in my eyes does fade
Carry me home when the shadow comes to take me away
Lay down my bones knowing I'll be in a better place
Release my soul, carry me home

Oooooooo...

Quietly I feel your whisper settle on me, quietly I'm carried on
Quietly I feel your whisper settle on me, quietly you let me go...
