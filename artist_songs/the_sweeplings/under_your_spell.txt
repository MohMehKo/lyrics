Come with me my dear, let me show you how it feels
Trade your light in for the dark, give me your heart
 Just a little taste, it’ll have me swept away
Follow you into the cold, just let go

Taking me over, and into the dark
Got me under your spell, under your spell
Taking me over, and into the dark
Got me under your spell, under your spell

 Never have I felt so strange,
don’t worry darlin’ that will fade
Somethings got a hold on me,
let it be

Taking me over, and into the dark
Got me under your spell, under your spell
Taking me over, and into the dark
Got me under your spell, under your spell

Spinning in a daze, looking for where I fell
I’ve been hiding things, secrets I cannot tell
Losing myself

Taking me over, and into the dark
Got me under your spell, under your spell
Taking me under (Close your eyes little darlin’)
And into the dark (Keep your lips sealed tight)
Got me under your spell, under your spell 
(Close your eyes little darlin’)
Taking me under (Close your eyes little darlin’)
And into the dark (Keep your lips sealed tight)
Got me under your spell, under your spell
