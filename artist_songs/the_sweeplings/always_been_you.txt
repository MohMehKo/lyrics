What if we started over and I could have seen
What was lying uncovered and hiding underneath

It tears me a part knowing how, 
I’m only just now finding out

It’s always been you
It’s always been you
Every word is true
It’s always been you

Are you anywhere out wondering what could be
Or staring blank at the ceiling just like me

It tears me a part knowing how, 
I’m only just now finding out

It’s always been you
It’s always been you
Every word is true
It’s always been you

Is it to late to make you mine
Tell me there’s still time

It’s always been you
It’s always been you
Every word is true
It’ll always be you
