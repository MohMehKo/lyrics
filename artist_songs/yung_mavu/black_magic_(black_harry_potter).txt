Abrada cadabra on a nigga
Expecto patronum on a nigga (what)
If Malfoy gonna run up on me
Then I'm a put my wand to the nigga (ay)
Ron in the back, Hermeline on the sack
Y'all motherfuckers don't know how to act
Voldemort ain't got shit on me
Say "hail Gryffindor" and "fuck Slytherin"
Run on yo ass with Sirius Black
Disappear for a minute then be right back
Professor Snape wanna make a potion?
You ashy as fuck you better get some lotion
Put a spell on the nigga then I dab on the nigga
Caught Voldermort and I folked on the nigga
My wizards lit, y'all don't even know
When I'm with your girl I steal the show
Glass on my face, you're a disgrace
A Dementor try to suck up my face
But yeah boy, I survived that shit
Scar on my face and my coat so lit
I was a little boy, but now I'm grown
Start it all off with the Philosopher's Stone
Then I took your girl to the secret chamber
I made her work her body I call it labour
But ay, there's more
Shout out to my nigga Dumbledore
Malfoy tried to kill him, but he a little bitch
Instead he got killed by the Half-Blood Prince
Tryna diss me? See that coming from far
Saw a girl sitting by the potion bar
She told me she was home alone
And then we went skrrrt in my flying car

Cause I got that black magic (what)
Got that black magic (ay)
Got that black magic (what)
I got that black magic (ay)
Nigga, I was born with a wand in my hand
Boy you alive for a one night stand
You killed Dumbledore and you didn't mean it
But you did it anyway now you gonna feel it
Cause I got that black magic (what)
Got that black magic (ay)
Got that black magic (what)
I got that black magic (ay)
Nigga I was born with a wand in my hand
Boy you alive for a one night stand
You killed Dumbledore and you didn't mean it
But you did it anyway now you gonna feel it

And I'm the best at magic and I'm friends with Hagrid
I don't care about fame, but now I have to grab it
Oh, you think you savage? But I know better
Got allowed to Hogwarts with a talking letter
He said shit about my dad and then I had to get him
Trying to steal the snitch, but you know I won't let'em
Cause I'm faster than 'em, smarter than 'em
And I can talk with snakes so I pull up with venom
I didn't talk about Dobby, but I know he got me
I've been sneaking round Hogwarts and they never caught me
But wait man, let me catch a breath
I'm going way too hard on this fucking track
You ain't with my gang, boy, you're just a fan
Heard you was a lame, get back to Azkaban
What the fuck man, what am I even saying?
I'm just a boy from SJ but you better know I'm not playing
