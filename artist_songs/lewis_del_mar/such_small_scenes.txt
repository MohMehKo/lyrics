Swimming in my new life downtown
Now I realize
Never felt at home in my hometown
And it's no surprise

'Cause I'm not like you
I know no family
None other than you
So please don't fight me

See who, who are you to say I'm wrong?
And who, who are you?
You made me strong

Now I got roaches and my roof sinks in
And I've been sleeping on floors with my friends
'Cause I feel better when I don't pretend
So you think that I'm blind
But I promise I'm fine
I'll call you if I cave in
Oh I'll call you if I cave in
