I want to drink your water
A tap from the Caribbean
Forbidden fruit's in season
Cherry lips and fresh peaches
You know I am cheating
But I can't feel guilty in the Mojave
So I want to drink your water
I want your water

You're somebody's daughter
Faded Westchester palace
They almost named you Alice
Never gave you an atlas
'Cause who goes to Alaska
When it snows in New York City
And who runs for the mountains
When the rock is a tall ass building
And every time you see it
You think that you're forgiven
So you felt no guilt
When we fucked on the dock in Brooklyn
Acting like children
You said you only live once
You also said you love your boyfriend
But that shit's not important
It never is
When you're twenty-two
And your parents pay your rent
That'll skew your world view
Like cosmic rays from microwaves
And tanning salons
I think you're fake blonde
I think you're cake
I think you're sus like bombing a hill
On a...
Wait
The night's getting wobbly

Wait
Tonight's getting wildly
It's seven in the morning
And I should leave you probably
But everything else is boring

I want to drink your water
A tap from the Caribbean
Forbidden fruit's in season
Cherry lips and fresh peaches
You know I am cheating
But I can't feel guilty in the Mojave
So I want to drink your water
I want your water
