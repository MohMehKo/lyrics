It was drizzling on the day
She asked me for divorce
I told her of course
What else do you say
I drank for six days straight
'Til gin came out my eyes
I walked around backwards
Trying to undo the times

The sky spun so fast
My stomach split
And I dreamed of the day
I wouldn't remember this

Memories
Evaporate
It's been this way since I was born
I'm gon' remember what I want to
Memories
I create
It's been this way since I was born
So please leave me alone

It was shining on the day
We climbed into the oak
You offered me a smoke
What else do you say
When you're only twenty two
Nothing to do all day
We laughed about megafauna
And listened to Madonna
Your hips were on my jawline
Like the first heat of summer

The sky spun so fast
It was a bliss
And I prayed for the day
I would remember this

Memories
Evaporate
It's been this way since I was born
I'm gon' remember what I want to
Memories
I create
It's been this way since I was born
So please leave me alone
