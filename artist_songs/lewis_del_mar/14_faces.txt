Bang, bang, let's go
She's hanging half her body out the car window
She's drinking every drop of the moon
She said it's so nice of you
To steal your mother's car and act eternal
But you seem more afraid than you used to now

14 ages
Used to be bravest
I used to be young but now
Life is so dangerous and
I'm feeling the days, feeling the days
14 faces
2 for each day just
Write in my book while I
Rip out the pages, ugh
I'm feeling the days, feeling the days now own me

Bang, bang, to the roof
Where we smashed the satellites and the fuse box too
Our sharp teeth are the only light
I drank the whole moon dry
Because all my friends are metalheads
Swear they'd never catch us dead
Split up when the police come
Yeah, running used to get me high
Now I only feel tired

14 ages
Used to be bravest
I used to be young but now
Life is so dangerous and
I'm feeling the days, feeling the days
14 faces
2 for each day just
Write in my book while I
Rip out the pages, ugh
I'm feeling the days, feeling the days now own me
