I don't want a thing from you
I don't want a thing from you

Spent the night alone in your company
Your body is a TV screen
Watched you throw the vase, didn't hear a thing
There's flowers on the ceiling
People come and go, they won't die for you
So why not lie to everyone you know
How could you trust a pendejo?

So I broke all of the lights in my hometown
So you never think I'm home when I'm not now
I don't want a thing from you
I don't want a thing from you
I don't want a thing from you
I don't want a thing from you

I keep my heart down low
Do you not know? Do you not know?
I keep my heart down low
Do you not too?
Cause I can't go up, down, down
Every time you come 'round
Oh, no
I keep my heart down low
Fighting is not what I came to do
I keep my heart down low
I keep it from you
Cause I can't go up, down, down
Every time you come 'round

I spent the fight on my phone looking up recipes
You're banging pots and boiling
The heat is high, it's messing with my reasoning
You swore you had my back

But now now, I know, know, know
Now now, I know, know, know
Now now, I know, know, know
Now now, I know, know, know
Now now, I know, know, know
Now now, I know, know, know
Now now, I know, know, know
Now I, I know, know, know
Know, know, know
Know, know, know

So I broke all of the lights in my hometown
So you never think I'm home when I'm not now
I don't want a thing from you
I don't want a thing from you
I don't want a thing from you
I don't want a thing from you

I keep my heart down low
Do you not know? Do you not know?
I keep my heart down low
Do you not too?
Cause I can't go up, down, down
Every time you come 'round
Oh, no
I keep my heart down low
Fighting is not what I came to do
I keep my heart down low
I keep it from you
Cause I can't go up, down, down
Every time you come 'round
