The party's sideways once again
Malt Liquor
Smiling sideways to my friends
But we're all getting sicker

The party's alive at 5am
But who's counting?
Dance around like skeletons
Cuz we forgot what we wanted

And it always seems the same
I know I know, I know it do
And we almost go insane
I know I know, I know it's true
And it always seems the same
I know I know, I know it do
And we almost go insane
Trying to chase
Some pleasure brand new

The morning's tie-dyed once again
High in the kitchen
These morning's I wish I'd grow out of this
Feels like it ain't my decision
Cuz I never learned to tell you no
No I never learned
Oh, I never learned to tell you no

And it always seems the same
I know I know, I know it do
And we almost go insane
I know I know, I know it's true
And it always seems the same
I know I know, I know it do
And we almost go insane
Trying to chase
Some pleasure brand new

Some pleasure brand new
Some pleasure brand new
