X-ray mornings and the mirror cracks again
Bad luck making and my bones are breaking in
This is the year that the years caught up to me
Sinking eyes and my thin vacation days
Do I grow or do I fade away?
Or do I talk about how things have changed?

Cause I won't live that long
No I won't live that long
But it don't feel wrong
When our minds are gone
On the roof at dawn
I won't live that long

X-ray evenings, cross examining my case
Crossed my heart before I lied straight to your face
I said I believed our best years had yet to take place
But I don't really believe in anything
Cause now I know that all plans fade away
And so I'm only planning for today

Oh I won't live that long
No I won't live that long
But it don't feel wrong
When my mind's all gone
On the roof at dawn
No won't live that long

Understand me when I say
All I had, I gave away
All I had, I gave away
Understand me when I say
All I had, I gave away
All I had, I gave away

Understand me when I say
All I had, I gave away
All I had, I gave away
Understand me when I say
All I had, I gave away
All I had, I gave away
