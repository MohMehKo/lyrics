High my blood, heavy like hot rain
I'm drown in you
Colors mixing on a hot day, hot day

In the streets without the street lights
And with no power lines
I am electric, I'm electrical
I finally found the rest of me

My dance hall is all bodies now
And they're burning sugar sweet, so sweet
And my old world is on fire now
As I move into the heat, the heat

High my blood, fresh fish and sticky plantains
I am bound to you
By the mystery of my own name

My dance hall is all bodies now
And that burning sugars sweet, so sweet
And my old world is on fire now
As I move into the heat
As I move into the heat, the heat

(In the streets without the street lights
And no power lines
I am electric, I am electric)

In the streets without the street lights
And no power lines
I am electric, electric

In the streets that are my insides
My father never lost his mind
How come I never call you now?
Why do I never call you now?
Bottom of the ocean
