New York Groove 
New York Groove 
I'm just talkin' about Shaft 
Shut yo mouth! 

Many years since I was here 
On the street I was passing my time away 
To the left and to the right 
Bulidings towering to the sky 
It's out of sight 
In the dead of night 

Here I am 
And in the city 
With a fistful of dollars 
And baby, you better believe 

I'm back, back in the New York Groove 
I'm back, back in the New York Groove 
I'm back, back in the New York Groove 

I'm back, in the New York Groove 
Back, in the New York Groove 

In the back of my Cadilac 
Wicked lady sitting by my side 
Saying "where are we?" 
Stopped at 3rd and 43 
Exit through the night 
It's gonna be extacy 
The place was meant for me 

It feels so good tonight 
Who cares about tomorrow 
So baby, you better believe 

I'm back, back in the New York Groove 
I'm back, back in the New York Groove 
I'm back, back in the New York Groove 

I'm back in the New York Groove 
I'm back in the New York Groove 

I'm back, back in the New York Groove [x18]
