Trucks-stop 
Seating on mind ladle court
Yes, on lined
We spy for few rangeland soul
As trunnions
Seating on round and the carry stoning soul
View Truckstop Control
Capsule to countdown and sending soul crown, sending smoke
Don't throng crony to the cradle
Truckstop On The Moon
Don't throng crony to the cradle no, no, no
Truckstop On The Moon
Don't throng crony to the cradle no, no
Truckstop On The Moon
On The Moon

And willed Las Vegas for plank in the mounted
Street light from steal and the Texas steam lean, storing in your league
We dredge after on rows and we followed citing spa-a-ace
Not found the friend you Clement 
Golden the finger you round Keven  
Rival with the stare that we're old in
