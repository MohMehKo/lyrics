You know Christmas time is a lovely time of the year 
You can crack a little soda, get a present, and have yourself a beer 
You can make everybody scream 
When you dress up like Santa and 
Come down the stairs 
And open all the presents 
Christmas is a crazy crazy crazy crazy time of year 
You can enjoy the snow 
Or if you live around Seattle you can enjoy the rain 
You can pluck yourself a tune on a tiny guitar 
Cause Christmas is a time for hanging around inside 
Eatin' all the rubarb pie 
Makin people happy with a present or two 
Cause Christmas is a tiny little time of year 
You can warm your nose and your knees and your ears 
Inside with a fire that's large 
I don't know what rhymes with large 
Maybe your mom's name is Marge 
That would be nice 
Christmas is a fabulous invention 
I think they even have a Christmas convention 
Down at the Holiday Inn you can go meet Santa 
And then sit on his lap and get yourself a present 
And you can already tell I'm makin' this up as I go along 
Mellowin' out makin' up a tiny Christmas song 
Cause we all know Jingle Bells 
And Deck the Halls too well 
So it's time for a brand new Christmas carol 
Christmas is a fabulous time of year 
Yes it is, so hold me near, near 
I wanna make it happen 
Open them presents and there wrapping 
Mind me, cause i got what i wanted 
But thats no the point now no 
Cause the point is to be with the ones that you love 
To not be on tour with the band that you love 
But to be home nuzzlein' with your 
Favorite person in the world who ever that might be 
Just go ahead and nuzzle up cause its Christmas time 
Merry Christmas everybody
