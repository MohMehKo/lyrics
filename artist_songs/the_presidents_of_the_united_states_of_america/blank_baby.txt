You might say someone else said it
Some worse some better then I
You might see someone taking pictures
They can't put them back and I will tell you why
Cause even when originals are dead
Something still put that idea in your head

You might hear someone else singing
This very same song
I can't slap on nasty handcuffs
Or scold like a lawyer screaming wrong wrong wrong
Cause even when the copyrights are fixed
A genuine thief has got a bottomless bag of tricks
I was born a blank baby and the world's here to fill my head
I'm still a blank baby but the world would rather see me dead
I was born a blank bay and the world's here to fill my head
I'm still a blank baby but the world would rather see me dead

You might see a painting in a studio
Might test the paint to find its wet
Start scraping down as deep as you can go
Until its just as blank as it can get
Cause even when the paint is dry
You can just erase it all by rolling back your eyes

I was born a blank bay and the world is here to fill my head
I'm still a blank baby but the world would rather see me dead
I was born a blank bay and the world is here to fill my head
I'm still a blank baby but the world would rather see me dead
Rather see me dead
See me dead

You might hear someone else singing
This very same song
I can't slap on nasty handcuffs
Or scold like a teacher screaming wrong wrong wrong
Cause all the originals are dead.

I was born a blank bay and the world is here to fill my head
I'm still a blank baby but the world would rather see me dead
I was born a blank bay and the world is here to fill my head
I'm still a blank baby but the world would rather see me dead
Rather see me dead
See me dead
You'd rather see me dead
Rather see me dead
You'd rather see me dead
You'd rather see me dead
