You're the one.. you're the sunshine [x2]
Every time I see you [x2]
Every time 
You're the one.. you're the sunshine [x2]
Ooh.....
And I want to be near you 
And I want to be where you are 
You're a steak and I spear you 
You sell beers and a sparkle star 
Nestled between a worm and rock 
Snuggle it down for sleep time 
Long lazy afternoon spent shearing poodles in the park
You're the one.. you're the sunshine [x2]
Every time I see you [x2]
Every time 
You're the one.. you're the sunshine [x2]
Ooh.....
And I want to be near you 
And I let you to dance on my feet 
If I squint I can hear you 
Playing all day long in the street 
I look for your racecar 
Out on the highway 
Then you go zooming by me 
In your special zooming lane
You're the one.. you're the sunshine [x2]
Every time I see you [x2]
Every time 
You're the one.. you're the sunshine [x2]
Ooh.....
You're the one
