A billions of birdies squawkin' out loud
talkin' in code to clams in the clouds
They send a secret message, they send it by worm,
some vibratin' spiders will receive the word

But that's totally
feather-pluckin'
insane!
Ten million monkeys all pick up guitars,
Nobody taught them how
Five thousand fishies rockin' really, really, really hard
Nobody taught them how
Check-out chicken drivin' (vinny's) little blue car
Nobody taught them how!

Flies like to fly, cause they don't like to stay
They're buzzin' in the ears of a chicken all day
Chicken understand and they pick out the code
Send a sub-sonic signal through the snot in the middle
of an elephant's long wet cold grey nose

But that's totally
feather-pluckin'
insane!
Ten million monkeys all pick up guitars,
Nobody taught them how
Five thousand froggies rockin' really, really, really hard
Nobody taught them how
Check-out chicken drivin' (vinny's) little blue car
Nobody taught them how!

Oh yeah, Oh yeah

Everybody's supernova
