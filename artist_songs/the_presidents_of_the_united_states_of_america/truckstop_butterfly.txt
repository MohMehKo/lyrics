Truckstop butterfly
Covered in gasoline
Truckstop butterfly
Kiss you till you're clean

Me and a man with a mohawk on his head
Found a dirty butterfly half dead
Rainbow of shiny oil slick and stuck on wing
Helpless in a puddle muddy thing

7-11 cherry soda and a pie
30 ton steel grey cloud
And the sky is dark and dripping
Though we stop and wonder why
You're running late but what a great alibi

Truckstop butterfly
Covered in gasoline
Truckstop butterfly
Kiss you till you're clean
(get gone!)

Far out east in deserts there's a vein of inky gold
Here out west you wear it like a coat
Me and the man with a mohawk watch you go
Folllow sun and leave the melting snow

Man, how I miss you
Truckstop butterfly
Fly so I can't see you
Truckstop butterfly
I hope you made it, and you didn't die
Still, I do miss you
Truckstop butterfly
Truckstop butterfly
Truckstop butterfly
