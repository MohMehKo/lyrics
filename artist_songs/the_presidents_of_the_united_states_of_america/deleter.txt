I got erased 'cause she's a deleter
Wiped off the face of the earth and gone.
Shot into space 'cause she's a deleter
I'm a repeater she's a deleter
Now I'm gone gone, gone gone, gone gone
She's a Deleter
Now I'm gone gone, gone gone, gone gone
Woooo

Well there used to blood in my heart but it's Gone
Planets were hangin’ in space now they're Gone
I knew this clown downtown but he's Gone
What happened to the love that we had, it's all Gone
Seas had fish they were full of it Gone
Used to push now you're pullin’ it Gone
A certain girl could rock out the world, 
but she'd be dead and gone without me singing the song
C'mon

I got erased 'cause she's a deleter
Wiped off the face of the earth and gone.
Shot into space 'cause she's a deleter
I'm a repeater she's a deleter
Now I'm gone gone, gone gone, gone gone
She's a Deleter
Now I'm gone gone, gone gone, gone gone
She's a Deleter now I'm Gone, Gone Away

There used to be tears in my eyes now they Gone
Volcanoes were blowing their tops now they're Gone
I knew this pig with a wig now he’s Gone
What happened to the kisses we kissed they're all Gone
Skies and clouds were thick with it Gone
Used to be down, now I'm kickin’ it Gone
A certain man could ruin my plan, 
but I'd be dead and gone without him singin’ my song
C'mon

I got erased 'cause she's a deleter
Wiped off the face of the earth and gone.
Shot into space 'cause she's a deleter
I'm a repeater she's a deleter
Now I'm gone gone, gone gone, gone gone
She's a Deleter
Now I'm gone gone, gone gone, gone gone

She's a deleter now I'm wooooooo
And I'm lonely for you wooooooo
And I'm lonely for you wooooooo
And I'm lonely for you wooooooo
And I'm lonely for you

I'm gone, you're gone, we're gone
I'm gone, you're gone, we're gone
I'm gone, you're gone, we're gone
I'm gone, you're gone, we're gone
