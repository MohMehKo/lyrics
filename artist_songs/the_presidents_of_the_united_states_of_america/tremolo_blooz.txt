I bent down to catch a rose and I caught a thorn 
Hey Miss Monkey, how d'ya get so blue? 
Monkey looked up with her teary eyes and said

She got those tremelo blooz, ain't got nothin' to loose 
Ain't got nothin' but those tumblin', mumbling blooz
Hello Chickey you've been packed away 
For nine months and a cold December day 
Your yellow body's crumpled and covered with doo 
Here's a microphone, Chickey sing whatever you choose...

He ain't got nothin' but those tumblin', mumbling blooz
My friend Froggie, collapsed back stage 
Face down in a pile of cocaine 
The rocker doctor said he had the flu 
But Froggie felt it deep inside 
He knew exactly what he had to do...
He sing those tremelo blooz, he ain't got nothin' to loose 
He ain't got nothin' but those tumblin', mumbling blooz
