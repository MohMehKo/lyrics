Three PM and she's under the covers 
Dumpster breath she's my hungover lover 
Strong as steel, four olive martini 
Hand on her head and one on my weinie 

She's in bed, she's suckin' on a candy cigarette 
She's in bed, she's suckin' on a candy cigarette 
She's in bed, suckin' on a candy cigarette 
Suckin' on a candy cigarette 

Three PM and we're slow to recover 
We're hangin' out and well hungover 
This Ernie Steele's makes a mean martini 
So pass the fire and light me sweetie 

She's in bed, suckin' on a candy cigarette 
She's in bed, she's suckin' on a candy cigarette 
She's in bed, suckin' on a candy cigarette 
Suckin' on a candy cigarette
