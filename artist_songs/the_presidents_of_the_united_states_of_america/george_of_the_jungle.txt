George, George, George of the Jungle 
Strong as he can be 
Watch out for that tree 
George, George, George of the Jungle 
Lives a life thats free 
Watch out for that tree 

When he gets in a scrape 
He makes his escape with 
Help from his friends an 
Ape named Ape 
And his elephant shep can fetch a log 
He's mans best friend he's George's dog 

George, George, George of the Jungle 
Strong as he can be 
Watch out for that tree 
George, George, George of the Jungle 
Friend to you and me 
Watch out for that tree 

Hear him holler swing and sing 
All the animals come to the jungle king 
So grab a vine and swing in time 
If you smack a tree just pay no mind 
Like...
