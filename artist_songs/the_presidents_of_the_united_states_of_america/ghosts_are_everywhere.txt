Ghosts are everywhere
Inside big old bass tones
Deep in the belly of a fish
I can't help noticin'
Their pearly teeth are flickerin'

Ghosts are everywhere
Some are superstars with
Preformed, plastic, paste on hair
Driving, hiding behind sunglasses
And I just can't help but stare
And I hear them singin':

Na na nanana
Ghosts are everywhere
Na na nanana
Ghosts are everywhere
Na na nanana
Ghosts are everywhere
Na na nanana
Ghosts are everywhere
Everywhere
Over there
Under there

Ghosts are certainly everywhere
Swallowing whole trees
And startling creatures of the sea
Ran into one under my covers
And it gave me quite a scare
(gave me quite a scare)

Ghosts are everywhere
Flying through the air with the greatest of ease
And landing here and there
Never ever ever ever missing a beat
As they pound with some bones on a foam chair
And I hear them singin':

Na na nanana
Ghosts are everywhere
Na na nanana
Ghosts are everywhere
Na na nanana
Ghosts are everywhere
Na na nanana
Ghosts are everywhere
Everywhere

They're in the drain
They're in the sink
They're in between all the thoughts that you think
They're under my shoe
And in garbage sacks
In the middle of a mountain
In space where it's black
And they're everywhere
Wandering free and brushing by me
Late at night at the store twenty-four
Pickin' up a box of customized cookies
And disappearin' through the door
And I hear them sing:

Na na nanana
Ghosts are everywhere
Na na nanana
Ghosts are everywhere
Na na nanana
Ghosts are everywhere
Na na nanana
Ghosts are everywhere
Everywhere
Over there, under there
Everywhere
Over there, under there
Everywhere
Over there, under where
Everywhere
Ghosts are everywhere
