Your so awful, your so ugly
So unattractive, so hard to get along with
I'd like to hurt you, I'd like to leave you
Cut these chains and release me
It's been a long time I spent my whole life
Trying to please you, trying to make you smile
But your fashionable unhappy
I'm lazy so I love you for a while
Like your the last, last girl on earth
Last girl on earth
Last girl on earth
Last girl on earth

And when I left you, yeah when I left you
I felt better, I was happy
Just for a minute just for a second
I thought I missed you I musta been loosing my mind
I'm alone now, I'm all alone now
Things couldn't get much worse
I can't help wondering. I can't help thinking
Could she had been the last girl on earth

Not the last last girl on earth
Last girl on earth
Last girl on earth
Last girl on earth

Last girl on earth
Last girl on earth
Last girl on earth
Last girl on earth
Last last last last last last girl on
Last last last last last last girl on
Last last last last last last
Girl on earth
