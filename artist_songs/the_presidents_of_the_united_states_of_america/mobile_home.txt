A tiny turtle in a can 
I dig a living room in the sand 
Poke a toe through a hole in the floor 
(Floor!) 
And ramble on some more 
(Ramble on!)
Mobile home..... My mobile home 
My mobile home
I take easy, small and slow 
I hang around 'till its time to blow 
I take easy, small and slow 
(Slow!) 
Shed away to lighten my load 
(Lighten the load!)
Mobile home..... My mobile home 
My mobile home 
Mobile home... Go! 
In the road
To some highway Pebble Beach 
Alabama's just out of reach (?) 
Lessiana temp swamp 
(Swamp!) 
Montana on a mountain top 
(On a mountain top!)
Mobile home..... My mobile home 
My mobile home 
Mobile home..... My mobile home 
I got mobile home 
Mobile home..... My mobile home
