Confusion, I trashed me life 
Confusion, get me out of my site 
Confusion, she just annoys ya 
Confusion, do I love her or do I just destroy her 

No matter what I do, I can't seem to kick it, and bustin' through 
My confusion, thats what I've got 

I want you out, out, out, out, out of my head 
I want you out, out, out, out, out of my head 
I want you out, out, out, out, out of my head 
I want you out, out, out, out, out of my head 
Right now 

Confusion, rotting from the inside out 
Confusion, shocked from the brain drain out 
Confusion, how do I feel 
Confusion, you don't seem real to me at all 

No matter what I do, I can't seem to kick it and bustin' through 
Confusion, thats what I've got
