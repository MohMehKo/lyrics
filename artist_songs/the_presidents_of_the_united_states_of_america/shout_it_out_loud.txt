Well the night's begun 
And you want some fun 
Do you think your gonna find it 
(Think you're gonna find it) 
You gotta treat yourself like number one 
Do you need to be reminded 
(Need to be reminded) 

It doesn't matter what you do or say 
Just forget the things you've been told 
We can't do it any other way 
Everbody's got to rock and roll 
Whoa-oa-oa! 

Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud 
Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud 

If you dont feel good 
Thre's a way that you could 
Don't sit there broken-hearted 
(Sit there broken-hearted) 
Tell your friends in the neighberhood 
Get the party started 
(Get the party started) 

Don't let them tell you that there's too much noise 
They're too old to really understand 
You still get rowdy with the boys and girls 
Becuase its time for you to take a stand 
Yeah-yeah-ee! 

Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud 
Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud 

Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud 
(You gotta have a party) [x7]

Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud
