She's a nurse, when it hurts
When it hurts, she's a nurse
When it's worse, the cuts and burns
She's a nurse, when it hu-u-urts

Stitchin' up cuts that come apart
Emergency surgery on my heart
Gonna fill it in, adrenaline, you gotta be their
Sugar in the medicine to make it sweet 

At home alone, lonely, dial 911
Cherry hypodermic you can fill it for fun
I want a hundred wenches tugging on rubber protectors
Sure, she's immune, 'cause I can't infect her

She's a nurse, when it hurts
When it hurts, she's a nurse
When it's worse, the cuts and burns
She's a nurse, when it hu-u-urts

Bad lights, battle scars and rubber gloves
Misdiagnosis this is germin' a lot 'cause
It's annoyin' when she's toyin' with my mental health
But playing Doctor with her beats playing Doctor with myself

At home alone, lonely, dial 911
Cherry hypodermic you can fill it for fun
I want a hundred wenches tugging on my rubber protectors
Sure, she's immune, 'cause I can't infect her

Can't infect her
Can't infect her
Can't infect her

She's a nurse, when it hurts
When it hurts, she's a nurse
When it's worse, the cuts and burns
She's a nurse, when it hurts

She's a nurse, when it hurts
When it hurts, she's a nurse
When it's worse, the cuts and burns
She's a nurse, when it hu-u-urts

Mock emergency
Requires surgery
My emergency
Requires surgery

Mock emergency
Requires surgery
My emergency
Requires surgery

On my heart, on my heart, on my heart
