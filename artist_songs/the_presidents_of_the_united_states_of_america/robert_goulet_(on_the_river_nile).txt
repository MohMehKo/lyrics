Standing up high on a mountain top 
Looking at the valley below 
Mary Poppins flies by on a rattlesnake and 
I burry my head in the Egyptian snow 

Robert Goulet on the River Nile 
Blue moon winking at the sky 
Look ????? ??? in his big ol' smile 
Crowching in the weeds 
I watch the boat float by 

They float by 
They float by 

Meltromay kissing a camel lip 
His pinky ring glistening in the sun 
Back-up band is a monkey and a horse 
Mel can barely bow when the band is done 
Eating gourmet on a by-plane wing 
Her silver tooth blinding the crowd 
Pilot does a barrell roll flip and stallin 
And a chorus girl mosh pit breaks her fall 

We brake her fall 
Brake her fall 
Yeah 
Do-do-do-do-do-do 
Hey...
