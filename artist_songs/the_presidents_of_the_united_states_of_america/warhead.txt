Let's be there when the manmade sun comes up
Keep me warm through the nuclear freeze 
Let's you and I see what this city looks like
Heated to one million degrees
To hell with stayin' underground
Drinkin' water from a can
You are a warhead baby
I am a nuclear ma-a-a-a-a-a-a-an

It's beautiful to see your face light up
This light a burnin' this brain of mine
Somebody told me ground zero was a happinin' spot
Basking in the ballistic shine 
Let's work out a mutual
Civil defense man
You are warhead baby
I am a nuclear ma-a-a-a-a-a-a-an

Some folks got a bunker
And the presidents got a plane
You are my warhead baby
I am the nuclear ma-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-an

Warhead baby
Irradiated irradiated baby uh huh
