Farm food's grown with a plant 
Raised and planted by hu-mans 
Riding tractories around 
And no matter where I might stay 
I'll eat farm food every day 
Get it down at the grocery 

Movin' to the country... gotta raise a lot of farm food

Took a little sap from a maple tree 
Raised some chickens to ??? 
And dreamed about green acres 
Pushed my basket down the aisle 
The supermarket stretched for a country mile 
Nature's bounty for a ??? or pie 

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah 

Bushels of farm foods.. farm foods for me 
Acres of farm foods.. farm foods you see 
Truckloads of farm foods.. farm foods for me 
Millions of farm foods.. farm foods you see
