Froggie jumped all over the stage that day
Froggie jumped all over the stage that day
Rolling Stone magazine... sucked him dry and made him king
Froggie let rip with a big burp
And froggie jumped all over the stage that day
Froggie jumped all over the stage that day
Mick Jagger kissin' frogie's lips... studying films of froggie's hips
His eyes are closed cause he's off in a world of ecstacy
Where froggie folks get the froggie scene

And froggie jumped all over the stage that day
WATCH HIM JUMP!
Froggie jumped all over the stage that day
Froggie jumped all over the stage that day

The rocket doctor came downtown to write prescription by the pound
And froggie spread it all around
And jumped all over the stage that day
Cause froggie jumped all over the stage that day

He got 50,000 in his flock
He plays arena animal rock
He can barely stand up straight but somehow he does
Make his way directly to the front of the stage and
Froggie jumps all over the stage that day

WATCH HIM JUMP!
Froggie jumped all over the stage that day

The show is over... the band is gone... the crowd is gone
His girlfriends gone... his make-up's all been sweated off...
And he's all alone...
He goes to fill that one last prescription...
The one with the deadly description...
He swallows it down...
His brain explodes... his eyes implode... his tiny heart goes peuny pop...
His shiny legs refuse to hop... and he floats on down...
To a buring place... he looks around...for a friendly face...
The band is there patiently waitin' for froggie's brand new sonic creation
He starts to ribbit... he starts to kick it
He starts to ribbit... he starts to kick it
Froggie jumped all over the stage that day

Rolling Stone magazine made him cry and missed the king
Froggie let rip with a big burp

Froggie jumped all over the stage that day
Froggie jumped all over the stage
