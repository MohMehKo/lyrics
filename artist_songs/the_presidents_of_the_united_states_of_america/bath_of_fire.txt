I let my thirsty boots wander all over
And they come home with lies about women
And in the evening toe up to the stars
Sun is comin' up and somethings feelin' funky

Old moldy korn club stuck in the mud it makes me
Wish for a million dollar view
Spend my last lone quarter on the korn klub's kool aid
And there's nothin else I'd rather do

There's nothin like a bath of fire
To get this deep down dirt outta me
There's nothin like a bath of fire
To get this deep down dirt outta me

Yeah
Razor fanged rattlesnake only tryin' to protect itself
I had to haul off and blow it's little head away
Sucked out the venom, kept the little skin and
Meat found it's way onto my plate

There go my boots complainin', tellin me it's time to go stompin'
I'd better listen or they'll kick my ass

Hell is down there yawnin', hopin I fall head first in it
Nothing like a bath of fire to get this deep down dirt out of me
Nothing like a bath of fire to get this deep down dirt out of me
Nothing like a bath of fire to get this deep down dirt outta me

Nothing like a bath of fire to get this deep down dirt outta me
Nothing like a bath of fire to get this deep down dirt
Nothing like a bath of fire to get this deep down dirt outta me
Nothing like a bath of fire to get this deep down dirt
Nothing like a bath of fire to get this deep down dirt outta me
Nothing like a bath of fire to get this deep down dirt
Nothing like a bath of fire to get this deep down dirt outta me
Nothing like a bath of fire to get this deep down dirt
Nothing like a bath of fire to get this deep down dirt outta me
Nothing like a bath of fire to get this deep...
