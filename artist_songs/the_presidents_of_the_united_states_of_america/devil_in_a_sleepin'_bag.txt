We here headed to Seattle 
Promotion sickness on the road 
Takin' it home to rock it out for the kids 
Dropped a tranny, jumped a railroad 
And went through a music store 
If you wnat to buy a van we're taking bids 

And the Devil shivered in his sleepin' bag 
he said traveling down the road is such a drag 
If we make it home by Friday we can brag 
And the Devil shivered in his sleepin' bag 

Well i just got back from Austin 
Ron and Guy-O done it all 
Funky Weasles there for all the world to see 
Lord, i hear an angel strummin' 
In a bar under the stars 
Junior Brown, Junior Browne, pick for me 

And the Devil shivered in his sleepin' bag 
he said traveling down the road is such a drag 
If we make it home by Friday we can brag 
And the Devil shivered in his sleepin' bag
