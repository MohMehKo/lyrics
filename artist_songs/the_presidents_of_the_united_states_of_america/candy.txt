The sugar's only sweetness,
Salt is ocean tears
And you were my only weakness
For years and years and years
You little (yo) sweetie
You were hiding in a jar
Now my mind is gone completely
Take off the lid and there you are

You're my can-dy
Can-dy

Well the devil, she made sweet candy,
took six days and nights to dream
On the seventh day she rested,
woke up early and made ice cream
Now the devil, she must be a dentist
with deep jawbreaker eyes
Red rope hair, gumdrop lips,
cotton candy thighs

(Chaga lava) stole my body
and aftertaste stole my mind
Left me dangling down defenseless
then sweet candy she said goodbye
Now my teeth are worn and useless
My eyes too sunk to see
My tongue swelled up to twice its size
and all I want to do is eat
