Hey my superstar, my flying shooting star
Somewhere in the night, my crashing meteorite
I got a rear view mirror
That I use to check my makeup
Drivin' down the super highway
Hopin' I don't wake up
She had that look like all those girls on my TV
I changed lanes in hope she would
In hope she would see me

Hey my superstar, my flying shooting star
Somewhere in the night, my crashing meteorite

I'm jet powered in the fast lane
I choose words I use to woo her
I shout them out my open window
She doesn't care she doesnt seem to
She had that look that said she could be the one to save save me
And then she swerved, she lost control
She flew her car into the sea

Hey my superstar, my flying shooting star
Somewhere in the night my crashing meteorite

Hey my superstar, hey my superstar
Hey my superstar, hey my superstar
