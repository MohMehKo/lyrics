I've been thinking about heading out
Where I've never been
I've been thinking bout finding out
How to find the end
I've been thinking about freaking out
If I can just find the time
And these ideas are leaking out
So put a plug in my mind
Now I'm thinking about sneaking out
With nowhere to go
I'm considering dropping out
Stepping out of the flow
Off all these radar scopes
To a place far below
And I'm finally finding out
How to lighten my load
I'm considering dropping out
I've been thinking about crawling out
From underneath
I've been thinking about heading out
Turn my back and leave
I would hit an ocean or a coast and that would be
I would hit an ocean or a coast and that would be the end of me

Thinking about heading out
Thinking about heading out
Thinking about heading out
Thinking about heading out
