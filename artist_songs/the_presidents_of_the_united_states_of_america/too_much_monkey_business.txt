Runnin' to and fro, hard 
Workin at the mill 
Never fail, get the mail 
He comes a rotton bill 

Too much monkey business 
Too much monkey business 
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in 

Say me 
Talkin to me 
Tryin' to run me up a creek 
Say you can buy ???? 
You can pay me next week 

Too much monkey business 
Too much monkey business 
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in 

Long-haried, good lookin' 
Tryin' to get me hooked 
Want me to marry, buy a home 
Settle down, write a book 

Too much monkey business 
Too much monkey business 
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in 

Same thing every day 
Gettin' up, going to school 
No need to be complainin' 
My objection's overruled 

Too much monkey business 
Too much monkey business 
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in 

Pay phone, somethin' wrong 
?? ??? ??? ??? 
??? ??? ??? 
I'll sue the operator for tellin' me a tale 

Too much monkey business 
Too much monkey business 
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in 

Working at the fillin' station 
Too many tests 
Wipe the windows, check the tires 
Check the oil and the gas(?) 

Too much monkey business 
Too much monkey business 
Don't want your operation, get away from me
