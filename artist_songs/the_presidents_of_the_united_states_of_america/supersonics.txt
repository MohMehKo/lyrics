So welcome to the game 
Ladies and gentlemen shout the name 
Seattle SuperSonics 
Are basketball bionic 

And Gary Payton was on 
Bounce pass up court to Shawn 
And the crowd sang along 

[chorus]
SuperSonics oh yeah [crowd]
SuperSonics 
[Kevin Calabro:]
Not just a regular team 

Nate McMillan with it, he is free over to Shremp 
In the corner, Gary wide open, he deLIVERS! YES! 
Gary Payton hits the three... aye caramba! 

15 seconds to play 
Detlef with the baseline J 
Up court fast break invaders 
The slam dunk terminators 

Fans can rattle the roof 
Nothing but net Big Smooth 
Five guys in a groove 

[chorus]
SuperSonics oh yeah [crowd]
SuperSonics 
[Kevin:] not just a regular team 

Get up Reign Man and make 'em good! 
Golly is that kid strong! Oh it's getting weird in here... 
Oh Ali Baba... nobody do the voodoo like you do! 

SuperSonics oh yeah [x8]

SuperSonics 
[Kevin:] not just a regular team... YOUR Seattle SUPERSonics!
