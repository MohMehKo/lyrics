Loose balloon, how high can you fly? 
You're a loose balloon, before you pop and you die 
Loose balloon, you made that little kid cry 
When you took off for the sun 

Loose balloon, how high can you fly? 
You're a loose balloon, before you pop and you die 
Loose balloon, you made that little kid cry 
When you took off for the sun 

And just this morning you were flat and deflated 
None knew if you were loved or hated 
Just another shriveled up loser in a bag 
So to the kid that tried to get ya 
Held like kitten, he was happy to pet ya 
Till' he caught a sucker and opened up his hand 
Free so free now the skies the limit 
20 miles up and its just the beginning 
Spaceman, planets and lunar surface here i come (here i come)

Loose balloon, how high can you fly? 
You're a loose balloon, before you pop and you die 
Loose balloon, you made that little kid cry 
When you took off for the sun 
When you took off for the sun 
People squint to look up 
People squint to look up 
Just to see you fly away 
Just to see you fly away 
Just to see you fly away 
Just to see you fly away 
Now, you're absolutely free, so don't stop 
You're absolutely free, so don't stop 
You're absolutely free, so don't stop until you pop
