In the summer he's licking all the fruit
looking for the garbage at the backyard BBQ
Busy buzzing through my house and round the porch
ziggin and zaggin up south and down north

When the air gets colder and the sun won't shine
When the winter comes he'll be a slow slow fly fly
He'll be a slow slow fly fly
He’ll take a long long time time
He’ll be a slow slow fly fly

In the summer he’s poking at the poops
round and round like a buzzy hula-hoop
Landing long enough to strike a funny pose
Landing at the end of your sunburnt nose

In the summer he’s cleaning off his feet
the sticky-licky ice cream he ate is super sweet
He’ll get much slower when the pond begins to freeze
so stop and feel the breeze wheeze through the trees

But when the air gets colder and the sun won't shine
When the winter comes he'll be a slow slow fly fly
He'll be a slow slow fly fly
He’ll take a long long time time
To be a slow slow fly fly

He’ll take a long long time
He’ll take a long long time
He’ll take a long long time
He’ll take a long long time
Slow slow fly
