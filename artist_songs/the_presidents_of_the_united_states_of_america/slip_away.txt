I had a girl 
Yeah.. "had" is the word 
I tried to hold on 
But it was pretty absurd 
She said she loved me 
And I said I loved her too 
But we weren't having any fun 
So what could I do
I let her slip away... 
Away.... 
I let her slip away... 
Away...
I had a car 
Yeah.. the colour was blue 
It kept breaking down 
So what could I do 
I put an ad in the papaer 
You know I called it a steal 
Then this guy came to see it 
And we struck up a deal
I let it slip away... 
Away.... 
I let her slip away... 
Away...
I had a thought 
You know I thought it a lot 
I thought I was smart 
And I now I know that I'm not
I let it slip away... 
Away.... 
I let her slip away... 
Away...
