Time will forward into insanity 
I have got the cure 
Eighteen miles off, off the beaches and 
It will hit the shore 
Siren blasting out the storm warning so 
Line up extra dumb 
You should be extra careful 
But I know you're not that numb 

She freaks out, she leaks out 
Hurricane 
I slide in, Injectin' 
Novocaine 
A Novocaine 
A Novo.. 

Ramble on and on and on and 
You got nothing left to say 
This will come to a semi-happy ending 
When I know that you're OK 
Hurricane, Novocaine 
I will never be the same 
Will you please calm down 
Never will I ever be in lover of the weather 
When the storm comes out of your mouth 

She freaks out, she leaks out 
Hurricane 
I slide in, Injectin' 
Novocaine 
She freaks out, she leaks out 
Hurricane 
I slide in, Injectin' 
Novocaine 
Novocaine 
Nova
