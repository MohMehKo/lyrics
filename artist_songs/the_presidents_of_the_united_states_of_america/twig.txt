Some weepy, creepy, willow, pillow boggy shit
Transcendental big wheel can ya feel it
I got a chickey face down trippin' so damn hard
His head splits open, stuffin' spills out into the car
Cup of dirty water and a lonely boney frog
Slip me seven dollars and I'll pump it full of smog
You paint a monkey gold, let him loose downtown
You start him with a smile, he'll come back with a frown

He's just a twig in the wind, a twig in the wind
A twig in the wind, a twig in the wind
I'm thick and thin and all right

I'm happy feeling crappy in my nappy little car
Squozen, frozen, duplicated, drunk in a bar
Tape recorded all distorted genius machine
A spokes model dipped in refried beans
And piggies' fateful price to put their necks on the stump
Dusty busted skeletons who pay at the pump
Multi-nippled rotating DJ sap
I'm shoulder high in crap and my water wings are flat

I'm just a twig in the wind, a twig in the wind
A twig in the wind, a twig in the wind
I'm thick and I'm thin and alright

I'm twig in the wind, a twig in the wind
A twig in the wind, a twig in the wind
A twig in the wind, a twig in the wind
Well alright
