So you stuck your chassis in the traffic flow
You didn't have to turn and go
But who can blame you?

Taxi driver cursed you and hit the gas
Low ridda slow to pass
Twisting home

And you make me feel so good to drive
The dashboard is alive
It winks and whispers

Drive-thru window to the park to park
But I'm not afraid of the dark
With your light

Crown Victoria
You make me smile

Used to crumble donuts on your seats
Policemen like to eat
And lick their fingers

Stocked and standard leather everything
Power lock sand-steering
Linger please

Crown Victoria
You make me smile
Crown Victoria
A million miles

Go!

Rented at the airport in LA
Poolside so we'll stay
Wandering you

Don't wanna give your keys to the man at Hertz
So extend the rental terms
One more day

Crown Victoria
You make me smile
Crown Victoria
A million miles
Crown Victoria
You make me cry
Crown Victoria
I was born to drive
