I feel lowdown and blue 
I didn't have what I wanted 
That's when I saw the sign 
Outside the place that promised salvation 
I gave the waitress my order 
She said it'd be just a minute 
(I was lookin' at the pies) 
You know I was hungry 
But not for food
At the love delicatessen 
Oh yeah 
I'll meet you at the love delicatessen 
Oh yeah
Outside the summer sun beat down 
On a lusty summer day 
Inside the people still had on their shades 
They were all in the dark 
I heard the bell ring 
And my order was up 
I could believe the size of the portion 
Man my eyes lit up 
Here it comes
At the love delicatessen 
Oh yeah 
I'll meet you at the love delicatessen 
Oh yeah
Mmm.. I think I've had my fill 
Went to the front counter 
To pay the bill 
Oh by the way 
Give me one of those cherry life savers 
And the summer sun beat down 
So hard and I was on my way
From the love delicatessen 
Love delicatessen 
Ill meet you there [x3]

At the love delicatessen 
Ok 
Ill meet you at the love delicatessen 
Oh yeah 
Ill meet you at the love delicatessen 
Ok 
Ill meet you at the love delicatessen 
Today 
Ill meet you at the love delicatessen
