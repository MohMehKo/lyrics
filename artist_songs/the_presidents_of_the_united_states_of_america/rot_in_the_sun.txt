I wanna rot in the sun 
I wanna rot in the sun 
I wanna rot in the sun 

This is a beautiful life 
Just 'cause it catches the light 
Gonna let it all slide 
Like butter on a warm night 

This irrelevant high 
This p-plentiful sky 
Y-y-your hair is blond 
But not the brow above your eye 

I take my mouth off my foot 
Give up and I feel good 
Give up and I feel good 
I'm gonna riot in the sun 

In the sun 
In the sun 
Rot in the sun 
Rot in the sun 

Dependable star 
It pumps like a heart 
You cut out the core 
Ignore the sweetest part 

'cause it's here to impress 
With perfect success 
Even at it's worst 
You know it burns when it's best 
No protection from the glare 
And I don't care, I don't care 
I'm gonna riot in the sun 

In the sun 
In the sun 
Rot in the sun 
Rot in the sun 

Yeeeaaah, yeeaah!
Yeeeaaah, yeeaah!
Yeeeaaah, yeeaah!
Yeeeaaah, yeeaah!

It's round and smooth 
A controllable cruise 
Get that match away from that fuse 
'cause it might explode 
And goodness knows 
I don't wanna rock and tip and sink the boat 
So everybody freeze, nobody sneeze 
I'm stuck and stung by the summertime bees 

AND WE WILL 

Rot in the sun 
Rot in the sun 
Rot in the sun 
Rot in the sun 
In the sun 
In the sun 
In the sun 
I'm gonna riot in the sun 
(Riot in the sun) 
(Riot in the sun) 
I'm gonna rot in the sun
