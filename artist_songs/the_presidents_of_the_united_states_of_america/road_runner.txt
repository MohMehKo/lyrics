You're on the highway and Road Runner goes beep-beep 
Just step aside or you might end up in a heap 
Road Runner, Road Runner runs on the road all day 
Even the Coyote can't make him change his ways 

Road Runner, the Coyote's after you (beep-beep) 
Road Runner, if he catches you your through [x2]

That Coyote's really a crazy clown 
When will he learn that he'll can get to mow him down 
Poor little Road Runner never bothers anyone 
Runnin' down the road his idea of havin' fun...
