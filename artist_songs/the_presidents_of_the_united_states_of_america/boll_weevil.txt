Let me tell you bout a friend of mine
His name is boll weevil, check him out

Spends all day
on his big butt
And he don't ever, ever get outside
I come to visit,
I bring some sunshine
And I just spread it all over the fire
He's stuck on his big couch
Stuck in his big show
He looks at the TV and he's all right
I come from the drug lord
The local drug store
(Bug is supplied) and he's never uptight

And I wonder:
"Boll Weevil, why don't you get out of your home?"

Said, "I'm comfortable here"
Don't wanna move, don't wanna leave
I said, "Boll Weevil, get right out of your home."

Goodbye, I gotta stay 
I will some other day
Bye Bye, gotta go to sleep
And let the tube shine
Let the tube shine
Let the tube shine
Let the tube shine

Now, I would tell you bout boll weevil
But that bug is just too scary
He's sittin' there all alone
I try to coach him out, but he would not (try surprise)
But he would not move a muscle when I tried

Make him see that the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see that the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see that the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see that the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see that the sun is shinin' outside

Boll Weevil, get right out of your home
Boll Weevil, get right out of your home
Boll Weevil, get right out of your home
Boll Weevil, get right out of your home

Now, I would tell you bout boll weevil
But that bug is just too scary
He's sittin' there all alone
I try to coach him out, but he would not (drop his pies)
But he would not move a muscle when I tried

Make him see that the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see that the sun is shinin' out
Make him see the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see the sun is shinin' outside

Come on little buggy, he's a little bug!
