I hate to sing another song about love
The flame is something that you should be aware of
I'm probably not the first one to claim
Love is a dangerous flame
Nobody knows who lights the fire
Put on a log and make it go higher
Blow out the pilot light on the stove
Because the flame is love and I'd

Get some water from the sink
Quickly now take a drink
Put out the fire from inside
Before it spreads and burns like lies
And she had a scar in the scape of a heart

I'd have to eat an aspirin pie
To cure the pain that in my eyes 
I've seem the flame lick and run lick and run, lick and run
You know the flame is love and
People burn and leave their shoes 
People usually burn in twos
Loves a fire that's quiet and slow
The flame is love, I'm a fire hose and I

Get some water from the sink
Quickly now take a drink
Put out the fire from inside
Before it spreads and burns like lies
And she had a scar in the scape of a heart

Hated to sing that song about love
The flame was something that you should be aware of
I'm probably not the last one to claim 
Love is a dangerous flame so I'll

Get some water from the sink ya
Quickly now take a drink ya
Put out the fire from inside
Before it spreads and burns like lies
And she had a scar in the scape of a heart
