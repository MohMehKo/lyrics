Hey..
3,4! [x4]
Ahhhhhh...
All this energy callin' me
Back where it comes from
It's such a crude attitude
It's back where it belongs
All the little kids growing up on the skids
Go "Cleveland rocks!", "Cleveland rocks!"
Jumpin' Jene Jene and Movin' James Dean
Go "Cleveland rocks!", "Cleveland rocks!"
"Cleveland rocks!", "Cleveland rocks!"
"Cleveland rocks!", "Cleveland rocks!"
"Cleveland rocks!", "Cleveland rocks!"
Mama knows but she don't care
She's got her worries too
Seven kids and a phony affair
And the rent is due
All the little chicks with their crimson lips
Go "Cleveland rocks!", "Cleveland rocks!"
Livin' in sin with a safety pin
Go "Cleveland rocks!", "Cleveland rocks!"
"Cleveland rocks!", "Cleveland rocks!"
"Cleveland rocks!", "Cleveland rocks!"
"Cleveland rocks!", "Cleveland rocks!"
I've got some records from World War II
I play 'em just like me granddad do
He was a rocker and I am too
Go "Cleveland rocks!"
"Yeah Cleveland rocks!"
Cleveland rocks!, Cleveland rocks! [x9 1/2]
OHIO!!!!
