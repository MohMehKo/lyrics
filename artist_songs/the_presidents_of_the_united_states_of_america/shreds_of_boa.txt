I invited salmonella poison
They brought their blushin' daughter, stuffed into a tux
I invited all the guitar heroes
We threw away the guest list, and lost a thousand bucks

I called all the local geniuses
They wrote the guide for the perplexed and the drunk
Wild eyed they came from all directions
Stompin' on the dance floor and droppin' all their junk

All I've got to show are shreds of boa
All I've got to keep is paper-thin
All I've got to show are shreds of boa
Smashed into the rug and vacuumed out again!

We're out again!
We're out again!
We're out again!

Hoo!

Check out the stone on Tammy Tuesday
She's handin' out a fortune in party favor pearls
Here come all those thunderin' beasties
Disabling security, and touchin' all the girls

Check out all the star-struck ramblers
Littering the dance floor with scorpions and Sting
Here come all the ruby-studded hap'ners
Everybody came and destroyed everything

All I've got to show are shreds of boa
All I've got to keep is paper-thin
All I've got to show are shreds of boa
Smashed into the rug and vacuumed out again

You left your shreds of boa
We sucked it off your chin
You left your shreds of boa
Smashed into the rug and vacuumed out again!

We're out again!
We're out again!
We're out again!

We're out again!
