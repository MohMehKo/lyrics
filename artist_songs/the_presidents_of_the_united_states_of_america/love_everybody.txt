Sally could barely rally, she livin' in cardboard alley,
Convinced she was doin' fine
Burt was a millionaire, sellin' that spray-on hair
Sippin' Californee wine

She was hardly handling and panhandling
Off-times she was squeezing out a dime at a time
From his limousine he could see beauty underneath the dirt
And this is what it said on the sign!

It said You gotta love everybody, make 'em feel good about themselves
You gotta love everybody, make 'em feel good about themselves
(You Got To!) love everybody tonite!
You gotta love everybody tonite!
You gotta love everybody, make 'em feel good about themselves

Bree was worth billions, she was killingly beautiful
A diamond with the venomous charm
Harvey was starving, carving tattoos on the punks,
Called himself "DaVinci of arms"

She was high on twinkies when she pulled in thinking
She could just get in and out, convenience is bliss
By the flash on the wall, she seemed twenty feet tall
And this is what he put on her fist!

It said You gotta love everybody, make 'em feel good about themselves
You gotta love everybody, make 'em feel good about themselves (yeah!)

You gotta love everybody
love everybody
love everybody
