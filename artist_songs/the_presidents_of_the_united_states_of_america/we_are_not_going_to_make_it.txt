We're not gonna make it
Oh, no!
We're not gonna make it

Cause there's a million better bands
with a million better songs
Singers who can drum
Singers who can sing

Deep in my heart,
I do believe
We're not gonna make it
Oh, no!
We're not gonna make it

Cause we don't have the talent
And we don't have the time
We don't have the patience
And we don't know how to rhyme

No, no, no
We're not gonna make it!
