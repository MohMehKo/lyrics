I had a dream.... Magic Johnson was ill
He autographed the ball.... small rubber ball.
Ten feet tall.... pig, big puffy shoes.
Are the cameras on.... are the cameras on?
Set the ball down.... went out to the court.
Shot a swish (laugh laugh)
Felt like a.... felt like a pillow.
Went back to his spot.... Magic was gone.
Same old ball..... time to go home.
