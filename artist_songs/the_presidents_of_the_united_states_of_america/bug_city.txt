Well.. I.. happened to..
Find me a buggy
Coming out from under a rock in the grass, yeah
He got his bug luggage
No time to talk he's walkin' fast, yeah

Said he's heading for a log where the lady bugs are plentiful
He showed me some brochures and I must say it was beautiful
I'm belly down and bendin' back the blades
Bug stopped just long enough for him to say

I'm on my way... to bug citay
I'm on my way... to bug citay

If you wanna dance with a buggy
Put all six feet on the ground, yeah
The bug will pick up your luggage
And drive you straight into town, yep
Where you're safe from the spray and the kitty and the chase
If bugs can make it there they could make it any place
Between the sun going going down and the sun coming up
Yeah bug city's rocking, Yeah that feather pluckin' log is lit up

I'm on my way... to bug citay
I'm on my way... to bug citay

And they're all going to bug city for the night
And they're all going to bug city for the night
Every single bug that you see on the sidewalk's
On his way to bug city for the night
And they're all going to bug city for the night

And they're all going to bug city for the night
Yes they're all going to bug city for the night
And they're all going to bug city for the night
Yes they're all going to bug city for the night
