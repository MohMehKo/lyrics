A bringing berry and bringing nickin' near stink like bear  
Rustlin' roung these dead boiling weeds
So I'm a long thin shat and squeal, not no snake no narrating that can squat me 
Roast Stick, Roast Stick, all of gear 
Lying, frying in the desert some
Wake up from a frightful night so
Boxtops tips and the hating stipend to right
So's for out or around the weird
Knee deep and sleeping in mud
Hausa, don't break a squirt, or sleep sleep sure I'll creeper down

What the hell am I doing here?
What the hell am I doing, doing?
What the hell am I doing here?
What the hell am I?

What the hell am I doing here?
What the hell am I doing, doing?
What the hell am I doing here?
What the hell am I?

(WHO IN THE)...Hell am I, the music gut
The single lelabyes and pooring rain but my umbrellas dry
Am I hella high? Am I lie'n or telling the truth?
Am I buying or selling to you?
Climb to the top then I fell in the roof
Now did the ceiling collapse?
Cure relax and no stress off your chest, yes puff the green serpent
While the judges panell's working so view channel surfin' for sure

What the hell am I doing here?
What the hell am I doing, doing?
What the hell am I doing here?
What the hell am I?

What the hell am I doing here?
What the hell am I doing, doing?
What the hell am I doing here?
Where is my?

What the hell am I singing about? 
This bad old banjo is busting sidelong all my beard 
My brand new baby end
He's got all skating skies they should have got that gear
What the hell am I singing about? 
Can't seem to focus my brad on ears 
Some sort of disconnected sensation

What the hell am I doing here?
What the hell am I doing, doing?
What the hell am I doing here?
What the hell am I?

What the hell am I doing here?
What the hell am I doing, doing?
What the hell am I doing here?
What the hell am I?

Hell am I? Yeah!
Hell am I? Yeah!
