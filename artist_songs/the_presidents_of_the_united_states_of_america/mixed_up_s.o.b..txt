You'd think she took me for a ride 
She held it all way up inside 
She held her breath and turned her face all red 
That's how they found her in her bed all dead and this is what I said 

She's a mixed up son of a bitch yeah yeah 
She's a mixed up son of a bitch yeah yeah 
Air ball punch line delivered with a twist and 
She's a mixed up son of a bitch 

You'd think she had me in a cage 
Like a bird on fire she flew into a rage 
Her eyes are permanently crossed 
Once you won her you could swear she made you feel like you already lost 

Because, 
She's a mixed up son of a bitch yeah yeah 
She's a mixed up son of a bitch yeah yeah 
Air ball punch line delivered with a twist and 
She's a mixed up son of a bitch 

Go now go! 

Desperate living so divine 
A sugar cube empire could be all mine 
She's stuck in gear it’s just too bad it's reverse 
You say I've seen bad well I've seen worse 

See the tv glowin’, ah-ah life is walkin’ by 
Hear the music flowin’, ah-ah life is walkin’ by 
See the lovin tree growin’, ah-ah life is walkin’ by 
An empty boat startsrowin’, that’s when you're knowin’ 
Life is walking you by 
Life is walking you by 
I could never tell you thruth about her ‘cause she’s so mixed up 
I could never tell you thruth about her ‘cause she’s so mixed up 
I could never tell you thruth about her ‘cause she’s so mixed up 
She's a mixed up son of a bitch 
She's a mixed up son of a bitch
