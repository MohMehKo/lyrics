Yeah! 
Drum solo.. drum solo! 
Phil Rott! 
Ladies and gentlemen.. Mr Phil Rott
Alright here's a song that we actually know 
And we actually made it up 
So I hope you actually enjoy it 
and it goes actually like this
Happy with no teeth, happy here in hibernation 
Slurpin' on a peach, starin' at the situation 
Kitty at my foot, meowin' out a conversation 
Rockin' back 'n' forth, that's my only destination
Old man on the back porch, old man on the back porch 
Old man on the back porch, and that old man is me 
Old man on the back porch, old man on the back porch 
Old man on the back porch, and that.....
Meeeeeeeee-ow, wow, wow, wow
Got a two-string on my lap, total subsonic vacation 
Got chicken on the drums, poundin' out a perfect prescription 
Got twenty little worms, all plug into amplification 
Got fifteen hundred bass drum luggin' bug-eyed monkeys 
All arriving at the station
Old man on the back porch, old man on the back porch 
Old man on the back porch, and that old man is me 
Old man on the back porch, old man on the back porch 
Old man on the back porch, and that.....
Me me meeeee-ow whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm old.. I'm an old man 
I took all my money 
And I bought myself a little shacky-condominium outside of Syndey, Australia 
I decided to retire here in Asustralia 
Because it's so gosh-damn beatuiful 
I love it so tenderly 
So much it's just home 
Oh so out for underneath the trees 
Come a bunch of little chickies 
And the buckets and the monkeys 
With the one-string, no-string string, two-string guitars 
"Hey Chris wanna jam?" 
Sure, why not!
But I'm an old man on the back porch, old man on the back porch 
Old man on the back porch, and that old man is me 
Old man on the back porch, old man on the back porch 
Old man on the back porch, and that.....
