I wanna be a jazz guy
And play the greatest American music
I wanna be a jazz guy
And play the greatest American music

I wanna learn all the chords
Solo till everyone in the room
Is bored

I wanna be a jazz guy
And play black music for white people
I wanna be a jazz guy
And play black music for white people

I wanna learn all the chords
Solo till everyone in the room
Is bored

Beyond belief
I can't wait for the end of my solo
A sweet sweet relief

I wanna be a jazz guy
And play the greatest American music
I wanna be a jazz guy
And play the greatest American music
I wanna be a jazz guy
And play the greatest American music
I wanna be a jazz guy
And play the greatest American music

I wanna learn all the chords
Solo till everyone in the room
Is bored
