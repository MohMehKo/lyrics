Ladybug, ladybug, poke your head out of the rug
And you come see me and bring your jug
'Cause when you come see me that’s when you get your good love

Down below the fuzzy lawn there's some romance going on
You been steppin' 'round with a beetle named John
I can tell 'cause you got your little long dress on
Boll weevil livin' in the flower; cold tuxedo in the shower
Gonna cross the room in about an hour
Maggot do a dance in the meat when the meat go sour
Maggot do a dance in the meat when the meat go sour

Common, common

Centipede, centipede, hit the disco half-past three
Gonna crack that spine; party in a pine tree
The DJ's groovin' and you're movin' to a broken beat

Dragonfly, dragonfly, stuck at the truck stop; you can't fly
You got mud on your wing; clouds in the sky
You're pretty and lucky that we did happen by

Troglodyte, troglodyte, didn't make it to the party on a Saturday night
Well, we waited up late and we left on the light
We're hopin' that you won’t keep mopin' but we think you might
Yeah, we’re hopin' that you won't keep mopin' but we think you might

Ladybug, ladybug, poke your head out of the rug
And you come see me and bring your jug
'Cause when you come see me that’s when you get your good love

When you come see me that's when you get your good love
When you come see me that's when you get your good love
When you come see me that's when you get your good love
When you come see me that's when you get your good love
When you come see me that's when you get your good love, yeah

Good - love
You are my ladybug now
Good - love
You are my ladybug now
Good - love
You are my ladybug now
Good - love
