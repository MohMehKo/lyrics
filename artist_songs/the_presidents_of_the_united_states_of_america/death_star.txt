Good evening, ...., it's for you
Hanging in the stars, suspended from the dark
Life is long and heavy like a shadow on a spark and it will blow
Massive killer orb hovering around
Looking for a spot to blast the good guys on the ground before they know
What hit them from above
It's the death star, something so incredible
Death star, something indestructible
Death star, massive and maniacal
Death star, teeny weeny vulnerable hole

Somewhere deep inside shifty to the core
The tank is full and fuelled
By the dark side of the force that makes it go
To and fro
Killing

Black hearted ball roll the devils dice
Destroy it one more time cause it's so good they built it twice
But now no more
No more, no more
It's the death star, something so incredible
Death star, something indestructible
Death star, massive and maniacal
Death star, teeny weeny vulnerable
Death star, something so incredible
Death star, something indestructible
Death star, massive and maniacal
Death star, teeny weeny vulnerable hole

Goodbye, death star
You were the largest weapon, ever manufactured.
