Under the island... middle of a mountain
There is a big bad... boomin' system
Blowin' speakers... woofers and tweeters
Amplifiers... melted wires
The parties exploded... the core is corroded
Under ground... the Puget Sound
Cause a shiftin'... and a drifin'
Big black boom box...stuck in the hot rock
It's in there flowin'... it's in there growin'
You don't believe me... that this scenery
Could be a cold blooded killer

It's gonna blow... Volcano
It's gonna blow... Volcano
It's gonna blow... Volcano

Now the island is shiftin'... the plates are liftin'
The core is creamy...docile and dreamy
Stopped up and steamy
Happy campers... poop in there pampers
When the mountain... becomes a fountain
Of white hot lava... molten magna
Super sonic... plate techtonics
Stero phonic... lava and tonic
The boom is bionic
Sony shut down... magnavox meltdown
Ballistic breakdown
Hi-fi heatwave... lo-fi lava cave
That sulfur smells... Mt St Helens
Pompeii was yellin'...

It's gonna blow... Volcano
It's gonna blow... Volcano
It's gonna blow... Volcano
It's gonna blow... Volcano
