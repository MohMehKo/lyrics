Big shiny jet plane in the sky 
Please drop us off as we go by 
We're an American band
And everything is rockin' out of control 
When we hit Japan
Faxes from the veiwers on tv 
Karioke hokey-pokey on the screen 
Dig my toes into the Pacific sand
And everything is rockin' out of control 
When we hit Japan [x3]
Yeah, 20 tonnes of Sushi-lovin' fun 
(Yum yum) 
The kiddy line will thank you one by one 
(Arigato) 
Please come out to see us when we land
And everything is rockin' out of control 
When we hit Japan [x25]
Yeah, hi ya! 
Wo-wo-ho-wo-wo-ho-ho-ho
