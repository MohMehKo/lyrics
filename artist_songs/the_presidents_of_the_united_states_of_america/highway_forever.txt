Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

There's asphalt in between us
That ain't gonna slow me down
My steel train can cut through the rain
Ain't nuthin' gonna stop me now

(I'm on a) Highway forever
I'll reach my destination never
(I got a) highway blue
May never ever ever ever get back to you

I got a many millions miles to travel
I got a thousand thirty towns to go through
Highway to dirt road to gravel
Spend a hundred hungry hours to get back to you

(I'm on a) Highway forever
I'll reach my destination never
(I got a) highway blue
May never ever ever ever get back to you

Ooh (giddy up)...Let's Go Now!

Woo!

Oh hoh, wow, wow, wow, wow let's go now

(hey!)

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Ooh!

Mmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm hmm hmm hmm (Let's go!)

(Yeah...let's go) Woo!

(Whadda ya got!?) I got a nickel in my pocket
I got a girl on my mind
I'm gonna be there tomorrow
Who knows what I'll find

I've just got twenty miles to go now
Home town stretch comin' up
But the car breaks down, outside of town
That's it, hey man, I give up

(I'm on a) Highway forever
I'll reach my destination never
(I got a) highway blue
May never ever ever ever get back
May never ever ever ever get back
May never ever ever ever get on back to you

I may never get back to yooooouuuuuu....
