They took a hot-rod motor and they put it in her heart 
It's a dream location but she's tearing it apart 
Tounge-tied and twelve 
Staring up at perfect pearls 
He's 13, she's 13 
She's a teenage girl 
Teenage girl [x5]
Skin the surface like a Mach 5 flower 
Fibreglass shakin' and it shatters from the power 
It's crush and blow 
When the engine overflows 
That motor's pride 
Just say goodbye to Water World 
Teenage girl [x5]

Tounge-tied and twelve 
Staring up at perfect pearls 
He's 13, she's 13 
He's 13 teenage girl
He's 13, she's 13 [x2]
Teenage girl
