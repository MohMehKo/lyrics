Drooling! Drooling!
Drooling! Drooling!
Drooling! Drooling!

I wanna run my nose through your hair
But if I did I think I'd lose it there
I wanna swallow your little mouth
But if I did I'd lose my water wings and drown (I'd lose my wings and drown!)
I kiss your head when you feel a tear
But it's easier to drool at you froooooooooom here

Droolin' at you
Makes me feel like I come undone
Droolin' at you
Makes me feel like a loaded gun
Droolin' at you
Makes me feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeel GOOD!

Drooling! Drooling!

I wanna pluck each one of your toes
But if I did I'd have to suck out the bones (I'm suckin' out the bones!)
I wanna lick your lambchops dry
So please excuse me while I hump the sky

Droolin' at you
Makes me feel like I come undone
Droolin' at you
Makes me feel like a loaded gun
Droolin' at you
Makes me feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeel GOOD!

So good!
So good!
Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh Yeah!

Makes!
Me!
Feel!
Good.
