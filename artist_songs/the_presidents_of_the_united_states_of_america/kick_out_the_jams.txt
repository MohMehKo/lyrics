I've been elected to rock your asses til midnight
This is my term, and I've jammed out my perm, but it's all right
I solemnly swear to uphold the Constitution
Got a rock and roll problem?

Set and see who I am
Let me kick out the jams, yeah
Kick out the jams
I done kicked em out

I've been selected to orbit the planet in a rocket
I'm going to mars, I got a message for the poodle in your pocket

And let us see who we am,
Let me kick out the jams, yeah
Kick out the jams
I done kicked em out
