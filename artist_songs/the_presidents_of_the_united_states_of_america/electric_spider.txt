Six black cherries and the juice of a lime,
Barbecue sauce and a grapefruit rind,
One part water, six parts gin,
A cup of mud and an octopus chin,
Bubble, bubble, toil, and trouble,
A little bat wing and a little bit of rubble,
Put it in the blender with a bit of barbed wire,
Serve it up cold,

Electric spider,
We're flying higher,
Electric spider,
Yeah, yeah, 
Spider,

Electric spider,
Yeah, yeah, 
Yeah, yeah,

Blackberry mold and lobster claws,
Swampy water and hamster paws,
Vodka, jello, and piglet snouts,
Jalapeno to make the kids shout,
Rooster beaks and donut holes,
Dew rops, lollipops, stripper poles,
Reduced to dust on a giant flyer,
Serve it up cold,

Electric spider,

Electric spider,

We're flying higher,
Electric spider,
Yeah, yeah, 
Yeah, yeah,

Juniper seeds and scorpion milk,
Cockaroach feet and silkworm silk,
Sweet vermouth and salt and brine,
Add a little dirt. Add a little wine.
Call in thorns from a dozen roses,
Grows and throws and old clown noses,
Almonds, salt to make you feel tighter,
Serve it up cold,
