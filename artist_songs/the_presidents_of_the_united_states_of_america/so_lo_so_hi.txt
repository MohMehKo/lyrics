Bird, you made me walk on dirt
My fin got all hurt
But I didn’t care because I had it in for you
You met me in the mud
We got as close as we could
And that is why I swim and swim down the drain

If I could walk and breathe air
I’d be too scared
I’m back in my pond
And now I feel so…

I’m so low and so high
I swim low and wonder why
Just a fish that wishes he could fly
I’m so low I’m high
I’m high
I’m high

Fish, you made me do the twist
But I almost drowned
The stereo you gave me only made a gurgle sound
When we talk, I blow bubbles
We meet up in puddles
You pour me pond water and I sip it like champagne

I’m pulling out weeds
From my claws and round my feet
I’m back in my tree
And now I feel so…

I’m so low and so high
I fly low and wonder why
Just a bird who wants to learn to swim and dive
I’m so low I’m high
I’m high
I’m high

So low I’m high
So low I’m high
So low I’m high
A fish that can fly
A bird that can dive
I’m so low I’m high
I’m so low, so low that I am high
