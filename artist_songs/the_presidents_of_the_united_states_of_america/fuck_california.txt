I'm in the mountains 
They're so beautiful and crystal clear 
They scrape the clouds with their top 
(and fuck California) 

The air's so clear 
I drink it in it makes me drunk 
I fall down and fall asleep 
(and fuck San Fransico) 

I dream of some little evil land 
With twisted little cragily experiences 
Down below the Oregon Border 
(and fuck San Bernardino) 

I'm there in my dreams 
I'm there in my nightmares 
And I got to sing about it all day long 
(and fuck weed) 

You've been naked in the sunshine 
You've been buried in the sand 
You've been living on the fault line 
In a chemical plant 

I've been pounding up and down I-5 
Highways wanader such a blast 
If only I could erase L.A. 
The trip wouldn'ta went so fast 

This city is so beautiful 
The clouds come out in the fall 
And I love to see them back 
(and fuck California!) 

Even on a cloudy day 
The sun pokes out through at the end of the day 
To make a little sunset experience even though you're depressed 
(and fuck Santa Cruz) 

Ohh I'm in Central Oregon now 
Driving my little tin blue can 
And I hear green onions sing 
(and fuck W????) 

Green onions on the little stereo 
And I feel like I'm going the right way 
Northway North, North, North, North, North! 

(Yeah keep goin' north boys!) 
(all right!) 
(Yahoo!) 

Sonic cookie on the outside 
Pure frosting all alone 
You've been fucking Winona Ryder 
And she got crabs on your bone 

The only good thing about California 
Is the band that I saw 
They held there breath to shout out Supernova 
They were playing in a shopping mall
