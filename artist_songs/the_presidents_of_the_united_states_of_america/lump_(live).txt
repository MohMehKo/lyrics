Hello everybody 
Alright! 
How.. ooh.. How's it goin'? 
So they tell me that everybody down on the floor bought 
Our CD to get down on the floor 
Thanks very much for buying the CD 
Give yourselves a big round of applause 
Shame on you people up there 
Alright 
Here's rock song
Lump sat alone in a boggy marsh 
Totally motionless except for her heart 
Mud flowed up into Lump's pyjamas 
She totally confused all the passing piranhas
She's Lump, she's Lump 
She's in my head 
She's Lump, she's Lump, she's Lump 
She might be dead
Lump lingered last in line for brains, 
And the ones she got were sort of rotten and insane 
Small thing's so sad that birds could land 
Is Lump fast asleep or rockin' out with the band?
She's Lump, she's Lump 
She's in my head 
She's Lump, she's Lump, she's Lump 
She might be dead
Lump was limp and lonely and needed a shove 
Lump slipped on a kiss and tumbled into love 
She spent her twenties between the sheets 
Life limped along at subsonic speeds
She's Lump, she's Lump 
She's in my head 
She's Lump, she's Lump, she's Lump 
I do beliveve that she's dead 
(Dead as a doornail)
Is this Lump out of my head, I think so 
Is this Lump out of my head, I think so, yeah 
Is this Lump out of my head, I think so 
And that's all I have to say about that
