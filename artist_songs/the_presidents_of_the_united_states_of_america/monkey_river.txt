In the hazy light I see 
Lonely croak, dark green dreams 
I got no paddle and I got no shoes 
I'm solo in a raw hide canoe 
Hundreds of thoes little bug eyes 
Them drooly running glassy eyes 
Smiling through the foggy soup 
I crack a grin and laugh in tune 

I would love to float on 
Monkey River 

Sad life hangin' out on a limb 
Purple Paul pluckn a guitar 
All string broke except for one 
Careful chimp 
Rest the bass 
Water's only shodow deep 
Monkey's dip into the river 
Black and blue moon light up the leaves 
Cypress branches chuckle and shiver 

I would love to float on 
Monkey River 

Tiny fingers hold my hope 
Felling full of water and holes 
Look like killers but they mean no harm 
I know them all my brothers..... 

An on the last on duck's boat 
Monkey's wave goodbye 
Patch my boat with chewing gum 
This purple haze is easy on my 

I'd love to float on Monkey River
