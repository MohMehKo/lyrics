Innocent bird
Recline on a long, long beach
Underneath the untouchable moon
Tucked inside your very own palm tree

It's easy to sleep with the stars
And stay up all night unblinking
And as the summer starts to end
The traps are set to spring

La la la la la la
Na na na na na
Na na na na na

Innocent bird
Live in our palm tree
We built it just for you
We know it's what you need

Be careful not to fly
Into that painting of the desert
And you'll be happy you're here
In our little plastic scene

La la la la la la
Na na na na na
Na na na na na

We hope you will forgive
This malicious mistake
We're sorry you have to live
Alone you're eyes look sad and heavy

And even this selfish song
Don't drift into your sanctuary
So we'll give you a radio
Now, aren't you happy?

Aren't you happy? [x7]
