Zero Friction (Zero Friction)
Zero Friction (Zero Friction)
Zero Friction (ooooo-ooooh)
In My life

Huge space station
Man it with a chimp until it dies
Zero Friction
Twirling on and on in the invisible sky
You've been happy since the dawn of time

Silent punk rocker
Take a break and shut down that guitar
Sit down and wonder
Where did the drum machine come from...i dunno!
You've been unsatisfied for some time

(I got) Zero Friction in my life
Zero Friction in my life
Zero Friction in my life
Give me Zero Friction

Zero Friction (Zero Friction)
Zero Friction (Zero Friction)
Zero Friction (ooooo-ooooh)
In My life

Smiling jet-plane
You hover happy without fear
You fire the pilot
(and) File your flight plan and dry your tears
You've been gorgeous for so many years

Massive gorilla
Put down that chew toy and take a break
And think about the cages
At the zoo where you spend your whole life eating steak
You've been unstoppable since prehistoric times...yeah yeah!

(I got) Zero Friction in my life
Zero Friction in my life
Zero Friction in my life
Give me Zero Friction (Zero Friction)

Zero Friction in my life
Zero Friction in my life
Zero Friction in my life
Give me Zero Friction (Zero Friction)

Zero Friction (Zero Friction)
Zero Friction (Zero Friction)
Zero Friction (Zero Friction)
Oooo-oooh, in my life
