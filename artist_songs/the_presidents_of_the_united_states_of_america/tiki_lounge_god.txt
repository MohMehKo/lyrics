I had a girl and she did me wrong 
I didn't let that kind of shit go on too long 
Split the clouds and divided the sea 
Showed the evil girl how nasty the tiki god could be 
She didn't call no more nor bother me 
My little tiki god make sure I'd live in peace 
One day I read they found a body in the river 
Tiki God, make me shake, make me shiver
I got a Tiki God... saves me... I got a Tiki God
When Bobby Brady found the idol in the rubble 
Had no idea it would cause so much trouble 
When Greg tried to throw it back in the ocean 
There was a rumble, an awful commotion 
Don't ask me how, but the tiki found Bobby 
He thought the idol was some Hawaiian hobby 
Turned out the god was mean and vicious 
Didn't respond to Bobby's 3 wishes
He had a Tiki God... saves him... he had a Tiki God
So when you're caught up in an evil plot 
Your life's in danger and you can hear the shots 
Your head is spinning and you're fading fast 
How long do you think the kind of fun can last 
Your luck will change with a simple motion 
I found my idol in a bottle on the ocean 
Splits the clouds and divides the sea 
And shows those evil guys how nasty those tiki gods can be
You got a Tiki God... saves you... You got a Tiki God
