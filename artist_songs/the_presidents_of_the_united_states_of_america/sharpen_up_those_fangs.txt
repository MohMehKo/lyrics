He's the boy with the messy mind
It's hard to find the time to clear it
He's the boy with the broken brain
Not insane but never happy
Sharpen up those fangs
Not insane but never happy
She's got those rock star girlfriend eyes
The kind that fry the back of your skull
She's the one with the skinny face
She's got an ace with sleeves stuffed up it
Sharpen up those fangs
Got an ace with sleeves stuffed up it

And it's no surprise, no surprise
The fangs aren't sterilized
I'm too weak for curled fingers
Too tempting to pass by

No surprise, no surprise
The fangs aren't sterilized
I'm too weak for curled fingers
Too tempting to pass by

She's the girl with the chocolate heart
She turns up the heat and melts her target
Stumbles into a poisonous thing
She feels the sting but it doesn't matter
Sharpen up those fangs
She feels the sting but it doesn't matter

Pull the spider out from under your boot
The venous tooth will make you smile
Let it bit cause it so damn cute
Let it bite and drain you empty
Sharpen up those fangs
Let it bite and drain you empty

And it's no surprise, no surprise
The fangs aren't sterilized
I'm too weak for curled fingers
Too tempting to pass by

And it's no surprise, no surprise
The fangs aren't sterilized
I'm too weak for curled fingers
Too tempting to pass by

Sharpen up those fangs
Sharpen up those fangs
Sharpen up those fangs
Sharpen up those fangs
Sharpen up those fangs
Sharpen up those fangs
Sharpen up those fangs
