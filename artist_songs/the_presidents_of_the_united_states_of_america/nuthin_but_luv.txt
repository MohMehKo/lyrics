You don't need nothing, don't need nothing, don't need nothing from me
You shoot out evil rays
You say you don't love, don't love, don't love me no more
But you told a different story yesterday
You took a trip, you took a trip
And didn't bother telling me that you were going away
You say you don't owe, dont owe me no explanation
But you've got something to say

You got nothin in your mind but love
You got nothin in your mind
You got nothin in your mind but love
You got nothin in your mind

I had a bouquet, had a bouquet of big bright red flowers
But they had turned all grey
I had a Mansion and a car that had a private shower
But you have thrown it all away
I pound and pound and pound and pound upon your door
And wonder when your coming out to play
You open on just enough for me to listen to you whisper that I better back away

You got nothin in your mind but love
You got nothin in your mind
You got nothin in your mind but love
You got nothin in your mind

Lets take a trip, lets take a trip, lets take a trip together
Lets go and throw it all away
I know you love me when you show me and you rub me
But the love we had just gotta go away
