La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, 

When I wake up... I lie in bed 
Sometimes I read and then I prop up my head 
I read books... but mostly magazines 
When I wake up... and I'm just lying in bed 
Just lying in bed 

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 

When I finally get up... I meet my feet touch the floor 
Look out the window... stick my nose out the door 
I check the temperature... I check the air 
That and my mood... decide what I wear 
When I wake up... 

Ooh la, la, la, ooh la, la, la 
Ooh la, la, la, ooh la, la, la 
Ooh la, la, la, ooh la, la, la 
Ooh la, la, la, ooh la, la, la 

When I wake up... I lie in bed 
Sometimes I read and then I prop up my head 
I read books... but mostly magazines 
When I wake up... and I'm just lying in bed 
Just lying in bed 

Ooh la, la, la, ooh la, la, la 
Ooh la, la, la, ooh la, la, la 
Ooh la, la, la, ooh la, la, la 
Ooh la, la, la, ooh la, la, la 

Ooh la, la, la, ooh la, la, la 
Ooh la, la, la, ooh la, la, la 
Ooh la, la, la, ooh la, la, la 
Ooh la, la, la, ooh la, la, la 
Oooooh
