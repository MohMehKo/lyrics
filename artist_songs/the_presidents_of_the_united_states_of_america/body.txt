Little salamander
Where did you go?
Edge of the yard
I found you, you know
All brown and hard

I can't get your body out of my mind
Can't get your body
I can't get your body out of my mind
Can't get your body

She goes smooth through my body, Yea!
Through my body she goes smooth
She goes smooth through my body, Yea!
Through my body she goes smooth

Little killer froggy,
Where did you hop?
Under the entertainment center
Realize you just couldn't stop
Worms found a hole in your booty they could enter and

I can't get your body out of my mind.
Can't get your body
I can't get your body out of my mind.
Can't get your body

You go smooth through my body, yeah!
Through my body you go smooth.
You go smooth through my body, yeah!
Through my body you go smooth.

Hey little lizard,
Where did you slink?
Left your cage door open
Under the basement sink
The drippin' water made your mouldy body eyes open and

I can't get your body out of my mind.
I can't get your body.
