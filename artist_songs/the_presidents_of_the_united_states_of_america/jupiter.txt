Send a probe through a massive storm
A million molecules make it warm and a star is born, hmmm
And the star had some sons and daughters
Some with some without water
Some cool and some run hotter

We blast an astronaut through the gasses
And do our best to save their little asses
Come home don't rocket past us no

Hello from inside a cloud
The particle smasher is maxing out
And its smelly and loud
Jupiter Jupiter massive passive ball
Jupiter Jupiter or or orbital
Jupiter Jupiter mass of gas and damnit
Jupiter Jupiter is pure pure pure pure planet
It's pure planet
It's pure planet
It's pure planet

Flying by in a perfect location
Billions of earths worth of exploration
Or just a space gas station, I don't know
From deep below the surface
The tiny life forms are getting nervous
Hope it doesn't hurt us walking on the slimy surface
We lost contact with home base
On the dark side of this place
Please send more human race
To fill the empty space

Jupiter Jupiter massive passive ball
Jupiter Jupiter or or orbital
Jupiter Jupiter mass of gas and damnit
Jupiter Jupiter is pure pure pure pure planet
It's pure planet
It's pure planet
It's pure planet, yeah
