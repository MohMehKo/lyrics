I'm Cranky, cause I got a reason to be
Been so long since I ever felt glee
This is for the time I wasted wishin' for you and me
N' this is for ignorin' my plea. But still,

I'd Doodle out your name in the stars so gladly
I'd Doodle out the love for you I've always had
I'd Doodle out my heart on time's shifting sand beach
I'd Doodle out my soul without you incomplete

I tell ya, my memory ain't what it used to be
But I can still tell the story of what happened to me
To tell the tale, try not to miss details
Of the one I still love beyond the pale

When we first met, my gaze froze on your sight
It was love that I felt, heart flutterin' all right
The next day you were gone, but I remember that night
The time we spent together simply changed my life

So I gave it a shot, like a romantic snot
I took off at a trot but it was all for naught
I never caught up, still I thought of you a lot
I had the hots for ya, but my heart got a clot

Most of my life spent, filled with discontent
And so the years came, and so the years went
I've seen the whole world, and I enjoyed it then
But I couldn't find you anywhere, I knew what that meant

I made an ass of myself searchin' low n' high
Now I just want to retire by myself and die
With memories of you faded in my mind
After most of my life I'm tired of trying

So I went after her. Who wouldn't? I loved her
The sound of her voice and the touch of her fur
Many years later the feelings they still stir
Make my breath quicken, and my heart flutter

I got your image, I got your picture
When I look at it, I get a stricture
In my heart, same as before
I threw the scrimmage, I threw the scripture

I chased across the countryside cause I knew you were the one
But after many years n' faces finally I'm done
I let you slip away, and so I spend my days overcome
With all the thoughts of what we coulda become

When I think of the life I wasted, I give a slight pause
It's hard to believe the time I spent with you as the cause
Burnin' shame is what feel, how did it go this far
It's so bizarre how you left n' crushed my heart

Endeavor, sadness of the bitterest flavor
The memories are the only things that I still savor
Hold that, thought cuttin' like a razor
Glacier, drink the whiskey and the chaser
