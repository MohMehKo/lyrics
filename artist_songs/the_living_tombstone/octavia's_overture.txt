Look at yourself, when you were young
In Ponyville, you did not belong
It was not what you have wanted

Made money by playing songs
Though nopony wanted to sing along
You felt that your talent was kinda wasted

Didn't last long, so long
Good-bye to my old place

Canterlot, Canterlot
Where the best of ponies are there

You ran off, so wrong
Your parents look at you; sad

Famous, famous
That's the only word that went through your head

They came to me

They looked me

So I told them:

I'm the type of pony everypony everypony should know 
I'm the type of pony everypony everypony should know 
I'm the type of pony everypony everypony should know 

Octavia, why are you still playing that cello?
So mellow, Octavia, Octavia, Octavia

Octavia, why are you still playing that cello?
So mellow, Octavia
Can you please play me a lullaby?

Here you are, in Canterlot
It's the place you always dreamed about
It's exactly what you have wanted

Playing music with the big boys now
Everyone is cheering and you take a bow
Everything is going well just as expected

So you decided, to call your best friend back from the past

It's me, your friend, I wonder how has been all these years

Can't talk, not now
Busy making a new song

Regret, regret
Why did I forget about her for so long?

I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry

I'm the type of pony everypony everypony should know
But I forgot who am I so I think I should go back home
Should I stay here at the place where everybody knows me for so long?

Octavia, why are you still playing that cello?
So mellow, Octavia, Octavia, Octavia

Octavia, why are you still playing that cello?
So mellow, Octavia
Can you please play me a lullaby?
