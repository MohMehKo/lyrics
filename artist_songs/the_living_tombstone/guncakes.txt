[Yelling At Cats:]
Put it in the mix, stir it up and bag it
Put a little sweets and sprinkles, add it
Wondering whether I am feeling like
Single shot rifles or fully automatic
One in the chamber, and ten in the clip
Gotta sell it quick or my friends will flip
I'm a chip off the old block, feeling sick
Aw fuck, royal guards, everypony dip!
Drop through the back door, trouble's stewin’
Got a new batch of cupcakes brewin’
It’s a little true that we’re good at screwing
Colts and mares with the stuff we’re doing
Hey, hey, sec, this gun won’t budge
Colt 45 is in the fudge
You may wanna settle just a little grudge
Wink wink, nudge nudge, and hey, we don’t judge
And hey, could I just interest you in
In a Glock, or this here m6a2
SCAR’s in stock, but we got a new issue
Promise it’ll rock and cut through tissue
Thanks, we’ll dish some tax and a fee
Relax, you can trust this Pinkie
No tracks for this transaction, see?
Just remember: you didn't get it from me!

[Hook - Living Tombstone:]
If you want them dead, just give us a call
We'll give you the guns so you can show them all
We'll give you anything for whatever it takes
It's an all-out war for a piece of Guncakes

If you want them dead, just give us a call
We'll give you the guns so you can show them all
We'll give you anything for whatever it takes
It's an all-out war for a piece of Guncakes

[Yelling At Cats:]
Guns, knives, stocks, rocks
No locks, it pops, and chops, and drops
Gunshots, no lives, it shocks and clocks
Heart is thumpin’, tick-tock tick-tock

Block these bullets bouncing off of my chest
Sock ‘em, cull it, with a bulletproof vest
Oh, you foal it, tell me, who coulda guessed
Pinkie would be rolling with the guns of the best

Guards be shaking in the corner and cower
Chests be breaking every minute of the hour
Haters keep talking ‘cause their mood is so sour
Then when we call ‘em they turn whiter than flour
Oh! You really know she is hostile
Really be brawlin’ with the gun shell apostle
Waitin’ to watch the equestrians topple
Life is a party always being her motto
Boom! She used to be so docile
Shake it and break it, make ‘em rest with the fossils
Blam! Guncakes is the gospel
Who would have guessed it’d ever be so colossal?
Uh! Now we’re lettin’ it known
Bettin’ and settin’ everything for the throne
Yeah, Guncakes makes us bad to the bone
Add another name upon the Tombstone!
