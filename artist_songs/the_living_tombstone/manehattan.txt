Accept what I am,
I'll be what I want,
If I try I will make something real something great if I try

Accept what I am,
Believe more in me,
I will work for myself not just make someone else stronger than she

Manehattan the city lights shine bright
Manehattan I'm waiting for my shot
Sticks and stones might break my bones but nothing will stop me
Manehattan

Now I can see,
All the things that I missed,
Selfishness blinded me all I saw was a broken mirror

Now I wont be afraid
To help someone else,
Cause I know when I give from my heart it will all come back someday

Manehattan the city lights shine bright
Manehattan I'm waiting for my shot
Sticks and stones might break my bones but nothing will stop me
Manehattan
