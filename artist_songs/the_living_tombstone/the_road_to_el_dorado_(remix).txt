Tulio And Miguel
Mighty and powerful gods!
Mi-Mi-Mi-Mi-
Mighty and powerful gods!

The stars, are not in position
For this tribute
Like he says
Stars...
Can't do it...
Not Today
Day-Day-Day-Day-Day

Guys you're broke, you got
nothing to bet with
One more roll!
You got, nothing to bet with
One more roll!
You got, nothing to bet with
One more roll!
You got, One more roll!

Guys you're broke, you got
nothing to bet with
One more roll!
You got, nothing to bet with
One more roll!
You got, nothing to bet with
One more roll!
You got, One more roll!

To commemorate your arrival
I propose a reverent ceremony at dawn
Then perhaps I could prepare
A glorious feast for you tonight

Both? Both
Both!
Both is good!
