Hey Cheerilee Hey Cheerilee
I'm afraid to raise my hand
I have something to ask you
Cause I want to understand

It's not about homework
It's about 1 + 1 is 2
I don't want you to teach me
I just want to be with you

[Hook:]
Hey Cheerilee hey cheerilee [3x]
I think I'm in love with you

Hey Cheerilee Hey Cheerilee
I'm afraid to see you after school
I can't come to your office
And tell you that you're cool

It's not about my tests
Or about my homework you should grade
I don't want you to tell me
I just want to go on a date

[Hook]
