I've travelled in time and I'm lost
In trouble without a cause, no reason at all
Now I'm a pony who can't help anyone anymore

And no one would ever believe me
even if I told the truth it'll go against me
So I'll shut up and wish my secret life
Will be back to as it was before

So,

I wish that I could go
on adventures again,
Back to the TARDIS, Fighting the Daleks, Right in time Again,

Wishing that I'd have a partner to friend with,
Being together and having fun,

I wish that I could go
on adventures again,
Back to the TARDIS, Fighting the Daleks, Right in time Again,

Wishing that everypony will know my name,
and call me Doctor Whooves

Some ponies will say that dreams don't last long
I'll prove them wrong, I am a time lord
I will travel back and forth in time
My name is Doctor Whooves
[x2]

Wishing and waiting is all I ever done
So now I am going and leaving to show I am the one
How can I come back to what I was before
and I hope to find a friend that show will me the door

So,

I wish that I could go
on adventures again,
Back to the TARDIS, Fighting the Daleks, Right in time Again,

Wishing that I'd have a partner to friend with,
Being together and having fun,

I wish that I could go
on adventures again,
Back to the TARDIS, Fighting the Daleks, Right in time Again,

Wishing that everypony will know my name,
and call me Doctor Whooves

Some ponies will say that dreams don't last long
I'll prove them wrong, I am a time lord
I will travel back and forth in time
My name is Doctor Whooves
