I'm not a fan of puppeteers,
But I've a nagging fear,
Someone else is pulling at the strings.
Something terrible is going down,
Through the entire town,
Wreaking anarchy and all that it brings!

I can't sit idly,
No I can't move at all!
I curse the name,
The one behind it all!

Discord, I'm howling at the moon,
And sleeping in the middle
Of a summer afternoon!
Discord, whatever did we do
To make you take our world away?
Discord, are we your prey alone,
Or are we just a stepping stone
For taking back the throne?
Discord, we won't take it any more,
So take your tyranny away!

Disco-o-o-o-rd
Disco-o-o-o-rd

I'm fine with changing status quo,
But not in letting go,
Now the world is being torn apart!
A terrible catastrophe,
Played by a symphony,
What a terrifying work of art!

I can't sit idly,
No, I can't move at all!
I curse the name,
The one behind it all!

Discord, I'm howling at the moon,
And sleeping in the middle
Of a summer afternoon!
Discord, whatever did we do
To make you take our world away?
Discord, are we your prey alone,
Or are we just a stepping stone
For taking back the throne?
Discord, we won't take it any more,
So take your tyranny away!

Disco-o-o-o-rd [x8]

Discord, I'm howling at the moon,
And sleeping in the middle
Of a summer afternoon!
Discord, whatever did we do
To make you take our world away?
Discord, are we your prey alone,
Or are we just a stepping stone
For taking back the throne?
Discord, we won't take it any more,
So take your tyranny away!
