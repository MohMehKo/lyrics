Everyone makes mistakes
I've had more than my share
But it's ok 'cause I'm gonna repair it

They say there are no retakes
But I just don't agree, no, this show
Is of my own making

Take it back to the start
I've had a change of heart
I know we can make it better than it ever was
I know we can make it better
I know we can make it better than it ever was
I know we can make it better

I know there's things to change
The path that I could choose is loose and
I must find a new one

Our fates are not yet written
I will take the warning, choose a
Way that's less destructive

Yeah, I know
we look bad
But we have only seen one path
Can't you see?
We are free
To choose our destiny

And be the way we want to be
A second chance, you just need to believe
Believe, believe, believe, believe, believe, believe, believe, believe, believe, believe, believe, believe, believe, believe, believe, believe...

Take it back to the start
I've had a change of heart
I know we can make it better than it ever was
I know we can make it better
I know we can make it better than it ever was
I know we can make it better

I know we can make it better than it ever was
I know we can make it better
I know we can make it better than it ever was
I know we can make it better
