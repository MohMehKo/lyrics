I really hate you
Stop getting in my way
I've lost my patience
When are you gonna decay?
I want to throw you out
Just like my broken TV
If you'll come back once more
It shall be painful you'll see

I hope you die in a fire
Hope you'll be stabbed in the heart,
Hope you'll get shot and expire
Hope you'll be taken apart
Hope this is what you desire

It's almost over
Why can't you just let it fly?
Don't be afraid
It's not the first time you'll die
Your mechanical parts click
Sounds like when I broke your bones
Once I get my second chance,
I won't leave you alone

[2x]
I hope you die in a fire
Hope you'll be stabbed in the heart,
Hope you'll get shot and expire
Hope you'll be taken apart
Hope this is what you desire

I hope you die in a fire
