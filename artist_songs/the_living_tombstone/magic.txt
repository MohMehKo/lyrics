[L:] I'm Trixie Welcome to the show
Got Magic tricks so here we go
We're gonna have some fun
hold on to your hats

[T:] We don't care who you are anymore
Just pack your things go out the door
You claim that your performing
Don't make us laugh

[L:] I have something more

[T:] We've seen it before

[L:] It's much more special

[T:] We'd rather be in hell

[L:] It might be the same act
be patient you'll see
you can call it fake
but this is real magic...

real magic...

[L:] Look as I make stuff lavitate
Making a rope act like a snake
and of course the famous
bunny from a hat!

Got magic cards
And so much more
I even brought fireworks
For all of you to all to enjoy

[T:] Who cares about that
It's all the same thing
All the same tricks
We've seen before

[L:] It might be the same act
be patient you'll see
you can call it fake
but this is real magic...

real magic...

[T:] Why do you still want to perform?
We tried to tell you all along
That this act is old
You have to face that!

[L:] I heard all what you have said
But I don't think I should be mad
the most important thing
Is to enjoy what you do!

[T:] But it doesn't make sense

[L:] It doesn't change a thing

[T:] Even if we say it's bad

[L:] I'm still performing!

[T:] It might be the same act
[L:] be patient you'll see
[T+L:] You can call it fake
but this is real magic...

real magic...
