These pipes that flow from the ink machine, give life to our little friend moving on the screen.
He's got 2 pointy ears and can be seen moving in the halls behind the scenes.
He's listening and always moving, following and choosing, standing and improving.
Then one day you pulled the spring and you re-animated our little bendy.

Bendy and the ink machine, ahhh ahhh ahhh.
In a way you've never seen, ahhh ahhh ahhh.
Bendy and the ink machine, ahhh ahhh ahhh.
Better watch out or he'll make you scream, ahhh ahhh ahhh!

He's got a friend named Boris that loves to play, that good ol' music from the day.
In a big large band with all of his friends, the clarinet was there for him til' the end.
With a hoot and a toot that's all he'd play, but now he's put up on display.
Waitin' to be animated with no heart, but that's a story for another day.

Bendy and the ink machine, ahhh ahhh ahhh.
In a way you've never seen, ahhh ahhh ahhh.
Bendy and the ink machine, ahhh ahhh ahhh.
Better watch out or he'll make you scream, ahhh ahhh ahhh!

The creators, they lied to us, created us for the Gods.
To please them and make things right and settle up all the odds.
We were never supposed to exist in this dimensional plane.
Now we suffer, it's all your fault and you will know our pain.
Pain, pain, pain...

Bendy and the ink machine, ahhh ahhh ahhh.
In a way you've never seen, ahhh ahhh ahhh.
Bendy and the ink machine, ahhh ahhh ahhh.
Better watch out or he'll make you scream, ahhh ahhh ahhh!

Bendy and the ink machine, ahhh ahhh ahhh.
In a way you've never seen, ahhh ahhh ahhh.
Bendy and the ink machine, ahhh ahhh ahhh.
Better watch out or he'll make you scream, ahhh ahhh ahhh!
