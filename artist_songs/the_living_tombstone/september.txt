[Screams]

I can't remember
What happened in September
When everything is gone
When it's dark and I'm alone

It's been forever
Since I could have remembered
Where the hell is everypony
I just want to know the story
Of what happened right before
I became so alone

Still can't remember
What happened in September
Back when everypony died
Trails of blood during my stride

I just discovered that
The ponies were defeated
By something really strong
It seemed very weird and wrong
It just doesn't belong
Like it came out of this world

[Mic The Microphone:]
"Finally. {Crazy Laugh}
Finally It's done! {Crazy Laugh}
It's finally done! {Crazy Laugh}"
[The Living Tombstone:]
"Stop It! He's trying to kill us all! Stop it!"
[Mic the Microphone:]
"No! I'm Going to save you.
I'm going to save you all! Don't you try to stop me!"

I've regained a small memory
Came to my head just like that suddenly
I think I've gotten a clue
Something tells me this is worse than what I knew

[Mic the Microphone:]
"This is your redemption day everypony!
Go away from me!
Stay away from me!
Go away! {Crazy Laugh}
You can't touch me now
You see this button here? I'm going to press it!"

[Screams]

I just remembered
What happened in September
I'm the one who killed them all
I survived after the fall
