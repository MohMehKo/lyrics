If you've got bills that you can't pay
If you need cash like yesterday
If you've got junk just laying around
No credit check, just bring it on down

At the pawn shop
Get your guns and guitars in one stop
Whatever it is it won't cost a lot
Living on the cheap
Get your vinyl records and some DVDs
At the pawn shop
Get your jewels and your tools in one spot
It don't matter if the goods are hot
If they're yours or not
Find the thing you want
Sell everything you got
At the pawn shop

Across the street from the Texaco
Is a neon sign saying "We buy gold"
One man's pain is another man's pleasure
One man's trash is another man's treasure

At the pawn shop
Get your guns and guitars in one stop
Whatever it is it won't cost a lot
Living on the cheap
Get your vinyl records and some DVDs
At the pawn shop
Get your jewels and your tools in one spot
It don't matter if the goods are hot
If they're yours or not
Find the thing you want
Sell everything you got
At the pawn shop

Get your girl a dress
Get a VHS
A whole mess of tools and a secondhand suit
Get some picture frames,
Nintendo games
Buy a cheap gold necklace with a stranger's name

At the pawn shop
Get your guns and guitars in one stop
Whatever it is it won't cost a lot
Living on the cheap
Get your vinyl records and some DVDs
At the pawn shop
Get your jewels and your tools in one spot
It don't matter if the goods are hot
If they're yours or not
Find the thing you want
Sell everything you got
