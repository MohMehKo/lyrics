The sun's goin' down and I just came back
You're goin' out with friends
You're in a dress I've never seen before, and your lipstick
A deeper shade of red
Your kiss goodbye don't hit quite right
And neither does your alibi
Yeah baby, do your thing
Go on and have a good time

I don't believe it
You got me feeling like a pistol
Whatever you say
Who's in your heart shaped locket?

Sittin' in the dark, tellin' myself
Everything's cool
I'm not the jealous type, but I'm startin' to feel like
A heartbroke fool
Sippin' on a half drunk pint that's startin' to
Rattle up my brain
Are my instincts right or am I drinkin'
Myself insane?

I don't believe it
You got me feeling like a pistol
Whatever you say
Who's in your heart shaped locket?

You just got home, must've lost your keys
Cause you're sneakin' in the window
You see me sittin' there, you don't say a thing
Cause you know that I know

I don't believe it
You got me feeling like a pistol
Whatever you say
Who's in your heart shaped locket?
