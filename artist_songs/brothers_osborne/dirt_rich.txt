Fridge is leakin' and the faucets drippin'
Smoke detector chirps all night
The squeaky screen door with a hole big enough
To let the neighborhood bugs inside
Out back Jack's got a chop top Cadillac
Three years up on blocks
The junk mail box lookin' like it's been drinkin'
Leanin' to 11 o'clock

We work a long day
Sunup to payday
For a life this big
If you're broke don't fix it
Learn to live with it
And like it just the way it is
When you're dirt rich

Laid back lax lettin' go and lovin' this
Itty bitty slice of American pie
Some folks think it's all about the money, honey
We're livin' proof that ain't right

We work a long day
Sunup to payday
For a life this big
If you're broke don't fix it
Learn to live with it
And like it just the way it is
When you're dirt rich

We work a long day
Sunup to payday
For a life this big
If you're broke don't fix it
Learn to live with it
And like it just the way it is
When you're dirt rich
When you're dirt rich
Oh, yep when you're dirt rich
When you're dirt rich
