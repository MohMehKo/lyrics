Wish I could say it was gonna get better but we oughta know better by now
Gonna pack my shit into a cardboard box and get the hell outta this house
Gonna roll on for the road hit more than that county line
This whole world has gone to pot and right now so am I

I'm movin' on to greener pastures
Gettin' stoned so it don't matter
I tried prayin' to the Man up high
I tried drinkin' 'til the well ran dry
I'm movin' on to greener pastures

I don't know what took so long to say so-long to you
All you do is wear me out just like the evening news
So you can plant your garden where you used to chew my ass
Yeah I don't want this dirt no more I'm tradin' it for grass

I'm movin' on to greener pastures
Gettin' stoned so it don't matter
I tried prayin' to the Man up high
I tried drinkin' 'til the well ran dry
I'm movin' on to greener pastures

Roll it up, light it up, take a little tope, 
hit it 'til it all goes up in smoke
Puff, puff, pass it around, back to myself by now

I'm movin' on to greener pastures
Gettin' stoned so it don't matter
I tried prayin' to the Man up high
I tried drinkin' 'til the well ran dry
I'm movin' on to greener pastures
I tried prayin' to the Man up high
I tried drinkin' 'til the well ran dry
I'm movin' on to greener pastures
