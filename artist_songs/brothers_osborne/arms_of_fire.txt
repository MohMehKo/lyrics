It hurts when you hold me lately 
So come on and hurt me baby
The spell that I’m in
The burn on my skin
The love, the hate, the high of the pain
You’re everything that drives me crazy

You got me flying down a James Dean highway
Love drunk and sliding sideways
Not watching the road
Not holding the wheel
You can’t even hear the tires squeal
And once again I go down in flames

In your arms of fire
I can’t escape
Staying or leaving, hurts either way
Waking a wire, I’ll never cross
Cuz everything in me is wantin’ to fall
To your arms of fire

Your kiss, my soul demands it
I tried the cold but I can’t stand it
No
Drawn to a spark, deep in the dark
It’s pulling me, tugging me, tares me apart
Here’s my heart, go on and brand it

In your arms of fire
I can’t escape
Staying or leaving, hurts either way
Waking a wire, I’ll never cross
Cuz everything in me is wantin’ to fall
To your arms of fire

It hurts when you hold me lately
So come on and hurt me baby

In your arms of fire
I can’t escape
Staying or leaving, hurts either way
Waking a wire, I’ll never cross
Cuz everything in me is wantin’ to fall
To your arms of fire
To your arms of fire
