There's a postcard picture
at the back of our minds
of a place we've never been where the sunshine shines
stop making excuses
about the dog and the cat
just get a general direction and a road map
Baby let's go there
hop in the truck and get out of here
we're goin out of our minds
with our shoulder to the grind gettin nowhere
baby it's high time
to get away together just you and I
While we're hesitating there's a piece of heaven waiting
on us somewhere
so baby let's go there
We'll tell your momma that we're leavin'
We'll stick a sprinkler in the yard
Turn off the gas and water heater
Girl it ain't that hard
We'll leave the laundry on the line
Forget the dishes in the sink
Just grab a string bikini And your sunscreen
Baby let's go there
hop in the truck and get out of here
we're goin out of our minds
with our shoulder to the grind gettin nowhere
baby it's high time
to get away together just you and I
While we're hesitating there's a piece of heaven waiting
on us somewhere
so baby let's go there
Well there be nothing wrong
with gettin good at gettin gone
well by the time we've done this song
we'll be long gone
