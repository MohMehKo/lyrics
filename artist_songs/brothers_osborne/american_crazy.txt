The same sky, the same clouds, the same dirt, 
the same ground we all live and die on
The same song, the same beat, the same car, 
the same street we run down our dreams on

We're lost, we're found, we're up, we're down, 
we're all just American crazy
We're left, we're right, we're black, we're white, 
we're all just American crazy
Just American crazy

Straight A's and drop-outs, up north, 'n' down south, 
we all bleed the same blood
Paycheck to paycheck, sun up to sun set, 
we're lovers and leavers, we're sinners and believers

We're lost, we're found, we're up, we're down, 
we're all just American crazy
We're left, we're right, we're black, we're white, 
we're all just American crazy
Just American crazy

Same tune, same town, same school, same crowd, 
same fight for the home team, same love, same dream

We're lost, we're found, we're up, we're down, 
we're all just American crazy
We're left, we're right, we're black, we're white, 
we're all just American crazy
We're lost, we're found, we're up, we're down
We're left, we're right, we're black, we're white, 
we're just American crazy
Yeah, we're all just American crazy
