Starin’ at the prettiest part of this powder keg world
Sittin' with the finest example of a beautiful girl
If we hadn’t hit the brakes, we’d have no idea
Paradise was hiding right here

Dipping our toes in the water,
I don’t care if it gets any hotter
It’s you and me rememberin' how to have fun
Let's put our hearts together
Two parts love and a pinch of good weather
And top it all off with the sun and mix it with rum
Mmm mmm mm mm

Came out here to do a whole lot of nothing and we’re doing pretty good I think
The only one thing we need to worry about is filling up when the ice cubes clink

Dipping our toes in the water,
I don’t care if it gets any hotter
It’s you and me remembering how to have fun
Let's put our hearts together
Two parts love and a pinch of good weather
And top it all off with the sun and mix it with rum
Mmm mmm mm mm
Mix it with rum mmm mmm mm mm

Lucky folks go to the ocean
The lakes for the land-locked ones
We got a tarp and a truck bed, a kiddie pool, a slip and sled, let that garden hose run

Dipping our toes in the water,
I don’t care if it gets any hotter
It’s you and me remembering how to have fun
Let's put our hearts together
Two parts love and a pinch of good weather
And top it all off with the sun and mix it with rum
Mmm mmm mm mm
Mix it with rum mmm mmm mm mm [2x]
