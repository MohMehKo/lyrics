It might look like the same old same
The same old town, the same old name
Come right in, sit right down
Find yourself hanging around
For a couple more days
And I'm here to tell you for a pretty small town
There's a whole lot of something going down, down, down

Hey, hey, dig a little deeper
Drive a little further down an old dirt road
Old crow, gets a little sweeter
Once it gets to kicking and anything goes
My mind, amen
Just wait until the stars go down
There's a whole lot of something going down, down, down
Down home
Down home

Just sing along with the radio
Just a good old horse playing curtis row
Cheap guitars play out of tune
Barefoot dancing underneath the moon
It's a hell of a show
And what happens in the river we don't talk about
It's just a whole lot of something going down, down, down
Yes there is

Hey, hey, dig a little deeper
Drive a little further down an old dirt road
Old crow, gets a little sweeter
Once it gets to kicking and anything goes
My my, amen
Just wait until the stars come up
There's a whole lot of something going down, down, down
Down home
Down home

Hey, hey, dig a little deeper
Drive a little further down that old dirt road
Old crow, gets a little sweeter
Once it gets to thinking and anything goes
My my, amen
Just wait until the stars come up
There's a whole lot of something going down, down, down
There's a whole lot of something going down, down, down
Down home
Down home
