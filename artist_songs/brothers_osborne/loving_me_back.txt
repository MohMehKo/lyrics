The smoke and the whiskey, ain't gonna miss me when I'm gone.
I thought that they needed me, but really they were leading me on.
It gets old waking up with your head in a vice, feeling empty as a bottle of jack.
But I finally found something worth loving, that's loving me back

You get me high, you get me stoned, it's a ride I ain't never been on.
It's a binge, it's a buzz, it's a drunk I can't find in no glass.
Yeah, I finally found something worth loving, that's loving me back. 

Bright lights, and guitars, and dive bars, playing for tips.
And pouring your heart out to strangers, is a strange kind of fix.
But filling a dance floor, is something I live for, but I give more than I'll ever get back.
But I finally found something worth loving, that's loving me back.
