Baby show me, I want you to hold me
Never felt this empty before
I can't take it no more
'Cos I noticed, we ain't got that closeness
Like the way we had it before
Baby open the door

Baby you ain't got the time
Tell me what is on your mind
Even when you're here I'm feeling so alone
You used to work me so hard
But now we're in rooms apart
Don't tell me you can't really see what's going on

I can't wait, tell me 'for it gets too late
Tell me that my heart won't break
I don't wanna let it go

Baby show me, I want you to hold me
Never felt this empty before
I can't take it no more
'Cos I noticed, we ain't got that closeness
Like the way we had it before
Baby open the door

Lately all the thrill is gone
Everything I do is wrong
You keep pouring water on these flames inside
Can we make it like brand new
Baby trust me and you
'Cos I can't go on like this another night

I can't wait, tell me 'for it gets too late
Tell me that my heart won't break
I don't wanna let it go

Baby show me, I want you to hold me
Never felt this empty before
I can't take it no more
'Cos I noticed, we ain't got that closeness
Like the way we had it before
Baby open the door

I could say I hate you now
But you see through me easily
I can't take the ups and downs
Take my hand, say you'll turn it around

Baby show me, I want you to hold me
Never felt this empty before
I can't take it no more
'Cos I noticed, we ain't got that closeness
Like the way we had it before
Baby open the door
