Now if it's love that your running from
Theres no hiding place, no love has problems I no
But there problems everybody has to face

But if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Keep on walking don't look back

We wont look back baby
Don't look back 
Don't look back

Now if your first love had broke your heart
There is something you can do (ooh ooh ooh)
Don't bring your faith in love because she hurt you (ooh ooh ooh)

All you got to do is put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Keep on walking don't look back
Don't look back baby
Don't look back

Love can be such a beautiful thing
Though your first love will put you down and I no I can make your love grow
If you just give me the time
if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Keep on walking don't look back
Don't look back baby
Don't look back

Forget about the past it wont last the past
Is behind you it can only remind you

So don't look back
So keep on walking
So we wont look back
