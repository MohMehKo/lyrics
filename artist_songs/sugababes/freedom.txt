I like the lights,
When they hit your face,
You're good as blind,
It blackens out your gaze
And we're on fire,
But I'm too caught in you to care

Let's walk away,
Into the night
It's getting late,
But we're right on time,
And I wanna be nameless
For a little while

[Chorus]
So raise your hand,
One fist in the air,
For freedom-dom-dom-dom
For being alive,
Not having a care,
For freedom-dom-dom-dom

Coz tonight, is the night,
That we break the speed of light,
So stand up,
Come alive,
Liberate yourself, coz freedom starts tonight!

Stand up [x7]

I love the night,
The way it covers us,
You're acting shy,
But you're curious,
Let's play with fire,
Coz we're too deep in this to care.

[Chorus]
So raise your hand,
One fist in the air,
For freedom-dom-dom-dom
For being alive,
Not having a care,
For freedom-dom-dom-dom

Stand up [x13]

Freedom!

Tonight's the night we're gonna live our life,
Tonight's the night we're gonna live our life,
Sing,
Freedom (Freedom),
Freedom (Freedom)

Freedom,
Freedom,
So raise your hand,
Freedom,

[Chorus]
So raise your hand,
One fist in the air,
For freedom-dom-dom-dom
For being alive,
Not having a care,
For freedom-dom-dom-dom
