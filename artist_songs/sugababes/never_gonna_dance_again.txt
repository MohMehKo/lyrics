Circles on the floor,
I'm getting down, low
But things ain't right, you're gone,
I'm losing ground, no

Do you remember when your heart was mine?
It's all I ever think when it comes to you and I
No I can't feel right, I'll be good and seal the deal
The rhythm can't just go its the only thing of you

And so I'm never gonna dance again,
I lost my rhythm when you said it's over,
And as the final record starts to play,
I feel the dance floor turning colder,

And so I'm never gonna dance again,
Cause all the music in my world has faded,
I know it's never gonna be the same,
I guess the moves just never made it

All this time, I'll work, I'll find
A perfect picture that I store in my heart
We were so bright to know we couldn't get it right
Our bodies are in twain now I can't get you off my mind
As we dance you know our feelings show
You oughtta know you got me
As we dance we know my heart's exposed
Now I'm alone you left me

And so I'm never gonna dance again,
I lost my rhythm when you said it's over,

And as the final record starts to play,
I feel the dance floor turning colder,

And so I'm never gonna dance again,
Cause all the music in my world has faded,
I know it's never gonna be the same,
I guess the moves just never made it

I'm getting dumped, the rhythm's all wrong
The record goes around, they're playing our song
I gave into the groove but its giving me pain
There's nothing you can do for me Mr. DJ

And so I'm never gonna dance again,
I lost my rhythm when you said it's over,
And as the final record starts to play,
I feel the dance floor turning colder,

And so I'm never gonna dance again,
Cause all the music in my world has faded,
I know it's never gonna be the same,
I guess the moves just never made it

Its over, its over
And so I'm never gonna dance again
Its over, its over
And so I'm never gonna dance again
Its over, its over
And so I'm never gonna dance again
Its over, its over
