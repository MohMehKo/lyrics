He's got me sick
Wanna get it
I can't help it
I just need it
He's got me sick
Wanna get it
I can't help it I just need it

You're always on my mind
I wouldn't call it love
But when we're in the club
We always move in time
And when it gets too much
I hurry home and rush

Wanna see me through the walls
Wanna slide through the floor
And my bed is calling
Blush, as my conscience starts to tell
When I'm going up the stairs
It can't wait 'till morning

Ooh there's something on my (who)
Is moving on my (who)
I think I'm gonna ooh ooh ooh ooh

Ooh there's someone in my bed
Must be something that I said
And it must of been good (Let me hear you say)
Ooh there's something on my mind
Don't know what I don't know why
But it must of been rude (Feeling good today)

Ooh there's someone in my bed
Must be something that I said
And it must of been good (Let me hear you say)
Ooh there's something on my mind
Don't know what I don't know why
But it must of been rude (Feeling good today)

Now it's about that time
Undressing with a sign
That later you'll be mine
We're caught into a vibe
With dirty thoughts that crosses over the stop sign
It's crazy that I feel
Confused it's so surreal
What's happening to me?
One touch and I'm just there
And I'm coming down the stairs
Bragging cos he made me go

Ooh there's something on my (who)
Is moving on my (who)
I think I'm gonna ooh ooh ooh ooh

Ooh there's someone in my bed
Must be something that I said
And it must of been good (Let me hear you say)
Ooh there's something on my mind
Don't know what I don't know why
But it must of been rude (Feeling good today)

Ooh there's someone in my bed
Must be something that I said
And it must of been good (Let me hear you say)
Ooh there's something on my mind
Don't know what I don't know why
But it must of been rude (Feeling good today)

Late at night your eyes on me (ooh)
I know you like what you can't see (ooh)
Face to face along we breathe (oooooh)
I can't see what's on your mind (ooh)
Moving slowly down my thigh (ooh)
And the thought just makes me (oooooh)
It feels divine

Ooh there's something on my (who)
Is moving on my (who)
I think I'm gonna ooh ooh ooh ooh

Ooh there's someone in my bed
Must be something that I said
And it must of been good (Let me hear you say)
Ooh there's something on my mind
Don't know what I don't know why
But it must of been rude (Feeling good today)

Ooh there's someone in my bed
Must be something that I said
And it must of been good (Let me hear you say)
Ooh there's something on my mind
Don't know what I don't know why
But it must of been rude (Feeling good today)

He's got me sick
Wanna get it
I can't help it
I just need it
He's got me sick
Wanna get it
I can't help it
I just need it
