Getting lost up in the music
Getting lost up in the music

Give me one more lie that's all I need
One of those alibies you feed to me
Cos that's my motivation
Boy that's the key
Everytime my heart breaks
More energy

Tell me how them girls don't mean a thing
And how you only have them eyes for me
Can't buy me some more flowers when you get caught
Another empty promise fresh out the box

You think I'm drowning in my sorrow
You'll be forgotten by tommorow

Thank you for the heartbreak
I guess all that I needed was some heartbreak
Or I wouldn't be here (getting lost up in the music)
Dancing off my tears (getting lost up in the music)

Thank you for the heartbreak
I guess all that I needed was some heartbreak
Or I wouldn't be here (getting lost up in the music)
Dancing off my tears (if I stop then I might lose it)

"Give me one more chance" It's all the same
Cos they don't wanna lose and they're afraid
Cos when you feel the beat moving up through your spine
You know it's gonna be the last thing on your mind

I know you think I'm devastated
But in the end it's just what I needed

Thank you for the heartbreak
I guess all that I needed was some heartbreak
Or I wouldn't be here (getting lost up in the music)
Dancing off my tears (getting lost up in the music)

It doesn't matter how bad it hurts
I found a way to escape the worst
Loneliness is what you deserve
So be happy knowing that I'm not here alone

Music's always a friend to me
No bitter feelings, no enemies
And I don't know what you thought you'd see
I gotta tell you boy I am so happy

Thank you for the heartbreak
I guess all that I needed was some heartbreak
Or I wouldn't be here (getting lost up in the music)
