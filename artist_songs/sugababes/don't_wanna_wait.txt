I don't wanna wait, don't wanna wait

I don't wanna wait my honey
I don't wanna wait
Don't hesitate my honey
Don't hesitate

I don't wanna wait my honey
I don't wanna wait
Don't hesitate my honey
Don't hesitate

You put your arms around me
You tell me how you feel
Tell me "I just can't let you go"
Then you just wanna go
Go on your own
This ain't no good to me
To me don't wanna be completely
Tell me why do you run away
Why to you hesitate?

I don't wanna wait my honey
I don't wanna wait (Don't make me wait too long)
Don't hesitate my honey
Don't hesitate (Baby don't take too long)

I don't wanna wait my honey
I don't wanna wait (I don't wanna wait)
Don't hesitate my honey
Don't hesitate (Ooh yeah)

I don't know (don't know)
Which way you want me to go
We're going round and round
Don't know what's going down
Can't wait around
You just gotta let me know
So tell me
Do you think we could be?
Be like the best of friends
Never will friendship end
Be there 'till the end
Ooh

I don't wanna wait my honey
I don't wanna wait (Don't make me wait too long)
Don't hesitate my honey
Don't hesitate (Don't hesitate no)

I don't wanna wait my honey
I don't wanna wait (See I don't wanna wait)
Don't hesitate my honey
Don't hesitate (ooooooh)

Don't hold it back
Bring all your love
Into my life (come into my life)
I'm standing here
Waiting for you
Make up your mind (Please make up your mind)
This is your invitation
Let's have some fun
Dance the night away
You and I

I know you wanna get next to me
See your friends are watching me
Gonna do something do it properly
If you want this you better run 'em next to me
Now I hate when they hold it back
Gimme those tickets yo what's with that
It's phat
Do you know what I mean
Give a king
That's what those guys we dream, what

Why would I wanna go hesitate?
Making days with you and you turn up late
It's a saying us guys can make you wait
Well not I
Playing eye spy is not my pie
Cross my heart and hope to die
Say bye bye, make you wanna wonder why

Don't hold it back
Bring all your love
Into my life
I'm standing here
Waiting for you
Make up your mind (make up your mind)
This is your invitation
Let's have some fun
Dance the night away
