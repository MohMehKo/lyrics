If you want a sly chick, 
On the Side Chick, 
It's not you and I 
Boy you better get your head checked 
But if your mind's right 
Then we just might 
Spend some time and we call it what we want

But if your mind's right

Spend some time and we call it what we want 

We could - just be - friends 
You know - How that - ends 

If you wanna call it love or call it lust 
Baby when it's just us 
We'll be testing like there ain't no stopping us 
Official is my definition 
If you don't agree 
Then that's your grief 
The fun will seize 
Boy 

It's not attraction that is missing (the intensity is there) 
And the kissing is amazing (I just wish we would beware) 
We're fine to show our feelings babe 
No games, I'm done with playing those 
We should - just be - friends.

If you wanna call it fun, or call it tease 
I'll just separate degrees 
And really do it in my head, now trust me 
I really feel more ready to commit to this, please 
If that can't be 
Then let me breathe

Let me tell you 'bout a boy, 
He's going la-la 
Try'na get my ya-ya 
But he's not commited, so i'ma tell him baby bye-bye 
Treat me like a yo-yo 
Papa that's a no-no 
If we're not official i'm so much better off solo 

Boys are going crazy on a day to day basis (and it don't stop) 
I just click and erase, 
Until they not try to trigger try'na get in my knickers (and you don't stop) 
This shit is getting ridicilous 
If a boy's ridicilous 
He won't pass my test 
Now put me on your speed dial and erase the rest (if you thought) 

We should - just be - friends
