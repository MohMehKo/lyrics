Every time I go down your street
I pray we'll meet
I look around and nothing's changed
But all this time has separated us
Press rewind and stop the tape

Let's play it from the start
And pause before we part
We'll lay it down again

[Chorus:]
So whatever you wanna do
And whatever you're gonna say
From the minute you find that you know that
There's a million different ways
So whatever you wanna do
And whatever you're gonna say
From the minute you find that you know that
There's a million different ways

To love me (to love me)
To love you (to love you)
To love me (to love me)
To love you (to love you)
To love me (to love me)
To love you (to love you)
To love me (to love me)
Dadadadada

And now we're face to face
We can't find words to communicate
We can't go on
Hiding there's something wrong
Press rewind and stop the tape

Replay it from the past
Confusing what we had
Can't try it out again

[Chorus:]
So whatever you wanna do
And whatever you're gonna say
From the minute you find that you know that
There's a million different ways
So whatever you wanna do
And whatever you're gonna say
From the minute you find that you know that
There's a million different ways

To love me (to love me)
To love you (to love you)
To love me (to love me)

Nobody's ever come close to us
Confident this time we might pull through
But the tape is distorting the tune
I can't hear you

[Chorus:]
So whatever you wanna do
And whatever you're gonna say
From the minute you find that you know that
There's a million different ways
So whatever you wanna do
And whatever you're gonna say
From the minute you find that you know that
There's a million different ways

To love me (to love me)
To love you (to love you)
To love me (to love me)
To love you (to love you)
To love me (to love me)
To love you (to love you)
To love me (to love me)
To love you (to love you)
To love me (to love me)
To love you (to love you)
To love me (to love me)
