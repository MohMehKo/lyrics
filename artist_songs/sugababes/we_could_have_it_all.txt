Slow day, might rain
I couldn't hear the weather man
Tight fit don't sit
Even when you loosen it
Your pace, no race 
You kind of just to get into it
Was it cause'we 
Never sampled the flavouring?

Someday baby
We could have it all
(you on me,me on you,smoking till' we both turn blue)
A steady speed 
And we could we have it all 
(me on you, you on me your kind of boring me to sleep)

But we keep on falling over everything
When you and me 
We could have it all 

You're street smart with a big heart 
You look like your having it
Talk fast, words last
When you look like your diggin' it
But i don't subscribe to the state that we're living it
Was it cause' we
We couldn't handle the flavouring

Someday maybe
We could have it all
(you on me, me on you, smoking till' we both turn blue)
A steady speed
And we could have it all
(me on you, you on me, you're kind of boring me to sleep)

But we keep falling over everything
When you and me 
We could have it all

Better things are gonna come our way
You know we're gonna make it through this change
We're sitting tight as a tourniquet
Beliving we could 
Have it all someday 

Someday baby 
We could have it all
(you on me, me on you, smoking till' we both turn blue)
A steady speed
And we could have it all
(me on you, you on me, you're kind of boring me to sleep)

But we keep falling over everything
When you and me 
We could have it all
