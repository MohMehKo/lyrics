Shake it, baby (Round and round and...)
Shake it, baby (Round and round and...)
Shake it, baby (Round and round and...)
Oh, see you shake it (Shake what your mama gave-, mama gave-, mama gave you)
Oh
Work, work
Shake it, baby
C'mon, let me see you shake it
Shake it, baby (what your mama gave you)
C'mon, let me see you work it
Shake it, baby 
C'mon, let me see you shake it
Shake it, baby
C'mon, let me see you work
Work, work, work...

You got me flowin' to your rhythm and it just ain't right
I got the feeling that you wanna be my man tonight
You got me losin' it; my head is always spinnin' around (Round and round and round and round...)

Shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, baby, baby
Shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, baby, baby (I wanna see you move)
Shake it, baby

I can't take you out
I know you watchin' me
Cuz as you walk away
You lookin' back at me
So, are you feelin' me, boy? (Are you feelin' me, boy?)
Or are you leadin' me on, yeah, yeah?
If you don't make a move quick
Then you be losin'
You play every trick
Boy, it's so confusin'
Let's leave it alone (Let's leave it alone)
I see your place on the floor
So, let's go

You got me flowin' to your rhythm and it just ain't right
I got the feeling that you wanna be my man tonight
You got me losin' it; my head is always spinnin' around
I know you feel it, just show me how to shake it down

Shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, baby, baby
Shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, baby, baby (I wanna see you move)
Shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, baby, baby
Shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, baby, baby

You got me flowin' to your rhythm and it just ain't right (Shake it, baby, shake, shake it, baby, baby)
I got the feeling that you wanna be my man tonight (Shake it, baby, shake, shake it, baby, baby)
You got me losin' it; my head is always spinnin' around (Shake it, baby, shake, shake it, baby, baby)
(Round and round and) Shake it what your mama gave you

Takin' time was fun
I watched you, all your body
I've been told a lot
Yes, since you came around us
I've been feelin' you, boy (I've been feelin' you, boy)
Be a little bit more, yeah
So, I'll give you one more chance
To get in the ride and
If you turn it down
I'm gon' be your harass
I ain't mad at you, boy (I ain't mad at you, boy)
I'll beat my horn and warn
Let's ride

You got me flowin' to your rhythm and it just ain't right
I got the feeling that you wanna be my man tonight
You got me losin' it; my head is always spinnin' around
I know you feel it, just show me how to shake it down
