Last summer we met
I'll never forget
Hanging out everyday
Guess that era has gone
You got what you want
Hope she works out ok

I bet you think I'm torn
That you're the one I miss
I'm over now you're gone
But that's not the way it is

[Chorus]
Surprise
While you call me up late at night
Expecting me to wanna die
I'm busy here with some other guy
It's good since you told me goodbye

Don't go wasting your time
Expecting me crying
Lost like I can't go on
Yeah, my pride's still intact
No danger of that
It must hurt to know you're wrong

You think I'm on my own
Just waiting for the chance
I'm getting what I want
But it's not the way you planned

[Chorus]
Surprise
While you call me up late at night
Expecting me to wanna die
I'm busy here with some other guy
It's good since you told me goodbye

Lately you've been saying it's a tragedy
Maybe yeah for yyou but baby not for me
Now I got someone who's taking care of me
It's you that's crying tears
And I like the way it feels

[Chorus]
Surprise
While you call me up late at night
Expecting me to wanna die
I'm busy here with some other guy
It's good since you told me goodbye
