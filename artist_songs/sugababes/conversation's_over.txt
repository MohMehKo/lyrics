Conversation.. oh

Did it start with an obsession?
Was the writing on the wall?
I can see through your deception
Through it all
I see clearly now
For too long you've had it your way
For too long I've tiptoed round
Finally we're face to face boy
No drama now
I'll stand my ground

[Chorus:]
Now the conversation's over
And there's nothing more to say
I've had my time with you
So hear me now
I won't stay
It's my turn to walk away

No point in talking round in circles
Or trying to read between the lines
I saw you dancing with the devil
I'm not blind
Don't sympathise
Cos for too long you've played your own game
For too long I've stood and cried
It's time I changed the combination
I'll be fine
Won't change my mind

[Chorus:]
Now the conversation's over
And there's nothing more to say
I've had my time with you
So hear me now
I won't stay
It's my turn to walk away

I've found the strength to finally say it
What the walls have heard a thousand times
And now there's no more pain
I'm no longer insane
I've reconnected my mind

[Chorus:]
Now the conversation's over, yeah
And there's nothing more to say
I've had my time with you
So hear me now
I won't stay (I won't stay)
It's my turn to walk away

[Chorus:]
Now the conversation's over (it's over yeah)
And there's nothing more to say (to say to say)
I've had my time with you
So hear me now
I won't stay (I won't stay)
It's my turn to walk away

Walk away
Walk away
