(Turn it on) Everybody's got their favourite song

Kinda person gotta be with
Situation feeling much stare
Played around with all the danger there
I couldn't handle it
So I abandoned it
There's two people in this sad affair
Had to think it so I did declare
We lost the feeling then we lost flare
I had a problem there
It couldn't be repaired

We
Lost our way
Had to pay
Life don't play
Life don't play

(On and on) Right here from the start
(On and on) Brought out the worst in me
(On and on) (Turn it on) I'm not your play thing
(Everybody's got their favourite song)
It's history (On and on)
Wanna blame the past (On and on)
So this pain will last (On and on)
Down for too long (Everybody's got their favourite song)

It's time that we moved on
I'm a girl that likes to be alone
Do my thinking on the telephone
If you misstepping in my danger zone
Like a matador I take you by the horns
I need a place I gotta get away
I brought him out into my Coachella
I'm gonna share it with a boy someday
We gonna run away and make a lot of hay

But we
Lost our way
Had to pay 
Life don't play
Life don't play

(On and on) Right here from the start
(On and on) Brought out the worst in me
(On and on) (Turn it on) I'm not your play thing
(Everybody's got their favourite song)
It's history (On and on)
Wanna blame the past (On and on)
So this pain will last (On and on)
Down for too long (Everybody's got their favourite song)
It's time that I moved on

(On and on) Right here from the start
(On and on) Brought out the worst in me
(On and on) (Turn it on) I'm not your play thing
(Everybody's got their favourite song)
It's history (On and on)
Wanna blame the past (On and on)
So this pain will last (On and on)
Down for too long (Everybody's got their favourite song)
