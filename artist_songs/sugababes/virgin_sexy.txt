Come on
Ooh
Come on baby
Ooh
Come on
Ooh
Come on baby
Ooh

She wants to be beautiful
Feeling kinda sexual
Getting it on
Hips move, walking down the street
Lips talking saying something sweet
She doesn't know

Strobe lights, I'm looking tight
With my snake skin boots
Feeling lucky tonight
Come on
Hormones raging, I wanna turn the page and
Take a look inside its amazin'
Ooh

How do I know it
I'm ready to take you there
Ooh
Just thinking about it
Really scares me
Like Freddie
Cuz I'm virgin, virgin sexy
Sexy
If you want me, just text me
Cuz I'm having a chemical reaction
Come on baby
Ooh

Sexy sexy sexy

Sexy sexy sexy
Ooh

All she see is lust in his eyes
Like he wants to be the first one
She ain't ready for the surprise
He just wants to get the job done
Ooh
Heading straight for the danger zone
Daddy wants to keep her ass home
Wants to explore the un-known
Roaming like a little cell phone

Strobe lights, I'm looking tight
With my snake skin boots
Feeling lucky tonight
Come on
Hormones raging, I wanna turn the page and
Take a look inside its amazin'
