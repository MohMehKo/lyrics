Give it to me now 
Give it to me now 
Give it to me now (Give it, give-g-give it to me now) 
Give it to me now (Give it, give it, get-get-get down) 

You've been talking like you wanna hop in and take a spin 
On my love, love, love, love... 
You say if you had the chance, your hands would be all over me 
Just like a glove 

But I know you type, and I don't see no style 
You get me all revved up just to slow me down 
See, you talk a good game, but it's all in your mouth 
I'm-a give you one shot, now, baby, lay me out 
Won't' you 

Give it to me now 
Come on in and put it down 
Give it to me now 
Make me hotter, boy, make me shout 
Give it to me now 
Come on in and put it down 
Give it to me now 
Make me hotter, boy, make me 

D-d-do what you said 
P-put your money where your mouth is 
Quit acting scared 
P-put your money where your mouth is 

You'll be playing round, knocking at the door 
If you're not trying to enter-er-er-er 
No petting, do come do what you came to do 
You wanna find my center-er-er-er 

But I know you type, and I don't see no style 
You get me all revved up just to slow me down 
See, you talk a good game, but it's all in your mouth 
I'm-a give you one shot, now, baby, lay me out 
Won't' you 

Give it to me now 
Come on in and put it down 
Give it to me now 
Make me hotter, boy, make me shout 
Give it to me now 
Come on in and put it down 
Give it to me now 
Make me hotter, boy, make me 

D-d-do what you said 
P-put your money where your mouth is 
Quit acting scared 
P-put your money where your mouth is 

Give it to me now 
Give it, give it, get-get-get down 
Give it to me now 
Give it, give it, get-get-get down 

Give it to me now 
Come on in and put it down 
Give it to me now 
Make me hotter, boy, make me shout 
Give it to me now 
Come on in and put it down 
Give it to me now 
Make me hotter, boy, make me 

D-d-do what you said 
P-put your money where your mouth is 
Quit acting scared 
P-put your money where your mouth is 

Do what you said 
Put your money where you mouth is 
No more talking 
Put your money where you mouth is 
All in my bed 
Put your money where you mouth is 
Quit acting scared 
Put your money where you mouth is
