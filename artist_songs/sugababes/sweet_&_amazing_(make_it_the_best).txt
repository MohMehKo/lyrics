Aaahhhh,
Life can be sweet and amazing,
Life can be sweet and amazing...

Unlock your heart a little bit,
And raise the moment,
You say you got a lot of weight on your shoulders,
I wanna tell you that the grass is greener...

Live this day like the last one,
'cause there's joy in every second,
Don't be afraid to find a good spirit,
Everyday has a real one...

Life can be sweet and amazing,
All you need is an idea of what you want,
Life can be sweet and amazing,
Takes a lesson and make it the best you can,
Life can be sweet and amazing,
All you need is an idea of what you want,
Don't let the little things try to bring you down,
Take a lesson and make it the best you can...

Your dreams are made of wishes,
To become reality not a fairy tale,
It's amazing that you can be real,
Just do good along and make things better...
