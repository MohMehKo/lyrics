Getting busy
Cannot stop I'm caught in a groove
Getting busy
Cannot stop I'm caught in a groove

You gotta get down down (Getting busy) (Cannot stop I'm caught in a groove)

Feeling sexy, dirty thing got his eyes on me
Walks up close, took a stroke, getting down dirty
He's watching
While I'm making circles on the floor
I'll have him begging for more

What you see's, what you're getting
You for me, you will stick it
It's so hot, in this kitchen
I'm so ready to go

Wind yourself around and grab a hold and ride it
You gotta get down down
You gotta get down down
Feel the rhythm driving, everybody's riving
You gotta get down down
You gotta get down down

Come and slick my embrace take my number down
Well it's for fun I know it turns you on
Wanna bump and grind with me
Pull it out of the bag, yeah yeah
