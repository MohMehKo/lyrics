You and I
We belong
Still we always bring our bullshit home
Time is passing us by
Holding onto you tight
I ain't letting go
I just want you to know

You and me together it should work
But your mind is in another universe
Your ambition is a thing I like to see
Let me know, let me know
If you can find some time for me

How can we be strong
When the road is more than a million miles long
When the song is done
Will the love be gone?
Or should we forget it
Get it
Don't sweat it
Regret it
I ain't with it
Let's quit, quit it

Is it red, is it green
Am I stuck in between
It ain't black or white
Just ain't feeling right
But it ain't what it seems
Can you say what you mean
Tell me why this always happens to me

You and me together it should work
But your mind is in another universe
Your ambition is a thing I like to see
Let me know, let me know
If you can find some time for me

How can we be strong
When the road is more than a million miles long
When the song is done
Will the love be gone?
Or should we forget it
Get it
Don't sweat it
Regret it
I ain't with it
Let's quit, quit it

Missing you lately
All of the time
All you seem to do is argue
Make up your mind
Come to my yard
Bring all the man dem
The broke ass niggaz
With all the fake gem
Communication, that's what we need
All the silence makes my heart bleed
All you wanna do sit and burn weed
No R E S P E C T
Tell me what happens to our quality time
Everytime we meet
You're bringing trouble to my mind
A good man is so hard to find
Maybe we should dead this
Come back rewind

How can we be strong
When the road is more than a million miles long
When the song is done
Will the love be gone?
Or should we forget it
Get it
Don't sweat it
Regret it
I ain't with it
Let's quit, quit it

How can we be strong
When the road is more than a million miles long
When the song is done
Will the love be gone?
Or should we forget it
Get it
Don't sweat it
Regret it
I ain't with it
Let's quit, quit it
