[Chorus]
Lush life
Takes away the time
Lush life
Takes away the time
Take one step at a time
Boy I'm still in my prime
I want the lush life

A little base is what I want
Need a finer place to do my thang
I want no boys holding me back
Coz once I get there, there's no turning back
So don't let this happen to me
Don't need no one to choose me
(Don't need to one amusing me)

[Chorus]
Lush life
Takes away the time
Lush life
Takes away the time
Take one step at a time
Boy I'm still in my prime
I want the lush life

I know exactly what I want
Supply the beat and we'll do our thing
You may say it's all in my mind
To me it's the lush life
Although it may take some time
So don't let this happen to me
Don't need no one to choose me
(Don't need to one amusing me)

[Chorus]
Lush life
Takes away the time
Lush life
Takes away the time
Take one step at a time
Boy I'm still in my prime
I want the lush life

Can't wait until the morning
Gotta see what I get for me
Gotta come onto the summer
Look at me coz I can work it

[Chorus]
Lush life
Takes away the time
Lush life
Takes away the time
Take one step at a time
Boy I'm still in my prime
I want the lush life
