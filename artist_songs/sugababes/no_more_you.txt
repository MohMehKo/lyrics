[x2:]
Ooh, oh-oh, ooh, oh-oh
Ooh, oh-oh, no, no
Ooh, oh-oh, ooh, oh-oh
Ooh, oh-oh, oh

Normally it wouldn’t be me
Act in no spy for the way that I am (Ooh, ooh)
But you did me so damn dirty
That I can’t force myself to give a damn (Ooh, ooh)

You lied to me about this one, that one
Like it was a game that you couldn’t stop playing (playing)
And so I don’t feel not a damn bit guilty that I’m
Showing interest in one of your friends
‘Cause it was what is was and now it is what it is, boy

We’re not together, I couldn’t be more happy (Ooh, oh-oh, ooh, oh-oh, ooh oh-oh, no, no)
Since there’s no more you, I’m finally gonna do me (Ooh, oh-oh, oh)
Imma do what I wanna do
No More You
Said Imma do what I wanna do
No More You

Everything you didn’t like me wearing now
Comes out of that box in the closet (Ooh, ooh)
And the necklace that you gave me
I would have gave it back but I think I lost it (Ooh)
Sorry

I remember how you didn’t like how
Some of those boys use to stare at me (Ooh, oh)
What if you saw me out one night with one of them
Tell me would it make you angry
(Really?)
Well it was what is was and now it is what it is boy

We’re not together, I couldn’t be more happy (Ooh, oh-oh, ooh, oh-oh, ooh oh-oh, no, no)
Since there’s no more you, I’m finally gonna do me (Ooh, oh-oh, oh)
Imma do what I wanna do
No More You
Said Imma do what I wanna do
No More You

We spent so much time trying to keep you happy (Oh, oh)
I was thinking about you, you were thinking about you
Who was thinking about me? Nobody
So now it’s time that I do me (Oh, ooh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)

We’re not together, I couldn’t be more happy (Ooh, oh-oh, ooh, oh-oh, ooh oh-oh, no, no)
(I couldn’t be more happy)
Since there’s no more you (No more you), I’m finally gonna do me (Ooh, oh-oh, oh)
Imma do what I wanna do
No More You (You)
Imma do what I wanna do
No More You
Imma do what I wanna do
No More You
Imma do what I wanna do
No More You
