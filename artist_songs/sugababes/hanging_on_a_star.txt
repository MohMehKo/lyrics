Tell me baby, baby 
Tell me baby 
Tell me what you want 
Tell me what you want 
You know you drive me crazy 
Drive me crazy 
Ive been waiting all day long 
Waiting all day long 

[Amelle]
Ive got a little crush 
Your body's such a rush 
So won't you hurry up 
Cause I want to get right up and own you 
Its getting hot and now 
Why dont you cool me down 
Then I can show you how 
To make a little babe on your own girl 

[Chorus]
Hanging on a star 
I was waiting round to fall in love 
And now I know im ready 
Cause, no matter where you are 
It was you that I was thinking of 
And now that star has fallen 
For you 

Listen to me baby 
Listen baby 
Your always on my mind 
Always on my mind 
I know you wanna kiss me 
Wanna kiss me 
Your running out of time 
Running out of time 

[Keisha]
I dont know what you've heard 
Mabey a little bird 
Gave you the wrong idea 
Your not gonna get my number 
But they dont have a clue 
How much I feel for you 
So what you wanna do 
Cause im not gonna wait much longer 

[Chorus]
Hanging on a star 
I was waiting round to fall in love 
And now I know im ready 
Cause, no matter where you are 
It was you that I was thinking of 
And now that star has fallen 
For you 
Hanging on a star 
I was waiting round to fall in love 
And now I know im ready 
Cause, no matter where you are 
It was you that I was thinking of 
And now that star has fallen 
For you 

[Heidi]
Ive been dreaming all day and all night 
Hoping that I will one day have you 
I dont care if its wrong or right 
Will my fantasy ever come true 
Cause im hanging 
Hanging 
Hanging 
Hanging 
Cause im hanging 
Hanging 
Im hanging 
Hanging 

[Chorus]
Hanging on a star 
I was waiting round to fall in love 
And now I know im ready 
Cause, no matter where you are 
It was you that I was thinking of 
And now that star has fallen 
For you 
Hanging on a star 
I was waiting round to fall in love 
And now I know im ready 
Cause, no matter where you are 
It was you that I was thinking of 
And now that star has fallen 
For you
