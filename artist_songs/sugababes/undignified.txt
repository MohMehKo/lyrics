Swollen eyes
No better to let you see them now
My wasted heart
Will never learn to drive the demon down

When you love the devil
You sell your soul
And it's hard to let it go

Undignified
I am tonight

[Chorus]
So give me false hope and promise me you'll try
To redeem yourself for the hundreth time
Lie to me if you must my dear
Give me a reason to have here
Even false hope allows me to still believe
In this powerful love that's consuming me
I'm hooked on a drug that steals your pride
It's hard not to seem so undignified

It terrifies me to think I'm not the only one
You'd be surprised how much I cry when you are gone

When your angel's the devil
Your church is a tomb
But I need to be with you

I'm undignified
Enough for two

[Chorus]
So give me false hope and promise me you'll try
To redeem yourself for the hundreth time
Lie to me if you must my dear
Give me a reason to have here
Even false hope allows me to still believe
In this powerful love that's consuming me
I'm hooked on a drug that steals your pride
It's hard not to seem so undignified

I'm addicted to the pain and pleasure you give
It's not how I wanna live
Controlled by him

[Chorus]
So give me false hope and promise me you'll try
To redeem yourself for the hundreth time
Lie to me if you must my dear
Give me a reason to have here
Even false hope allows me to still believe
In this powerful love that's consuming me
I'm hooked on a drug that steals your pride
It's hard not to seem so undignified
