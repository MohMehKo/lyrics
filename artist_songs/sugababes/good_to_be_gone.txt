The news is out, word is on the street
That I've been dancing to a brand new beat
You had your chance to sweep me off my feet
But I don't need you to make me complete

Now I'm gone
So good to be gone

You're looking at me like I'm from outer space
Well allow me to wipe that smile
Right off of your face
Whatever you thought was simply not the case
Cause I'm out of your reach
And I'm so out of this place

And I'm gone
So good, so good to be gone

Yeah, so good to be gone
So good to be gone
Yeah, so good to be gone
So good to be gone

So now there's something you wanna get off of your chest
And now you're sorry for making such a mess
And you never stopped loving me
But I couldn't care less
Cause that was some other girl, in some other red dress

And I'm gone
So good to be
So good to be gone

Yeah, so good to be gone
So good to be gone
Yeah, so good to be gone
So good to be gone

Yeah, so good to be gone
So good to be gone
Yeah, so good to be gone
So good to be gone

You never thought 
I'd break the spell that I was under
You never thought
I'd be as loud as thunder
You never imagined
How the tables could turn
Turn the light my match
Time to watch you burn

Yeah, so good to be gone
So good to be gone
Yeah, so good to be gone
So good to be gone

Yeah, so good to be gone
So good to be gone
Yeah, so good to be gone
So good to be gone
