[Sean Kingston - Chorus:]
Shawty is the type who like the finer things
Flowers, cards and candy they dont mean a thing
You gotta control her and jewel her with diamond rings
When shawty starts walkin she got everybody talking like..
Oh there she go right dere, oo there she go right dere
Little Miss Everything, she gotta have everything
Oh there she go right dere, oo there she go right dere
I'm gonna give you everything I love you Miss Everything

[Sugababes:]
Ya see me
I'm the one thats making sexy look so easy
All the guys want this and girls they wanna be me
Fashion is an under-statement head to toe
You see I'm cakin' it
But you wanna say she's mine

Ya pockets better be deep if with me you wanna creep
Nothing less than presidential suites awoho woho
Ya know I got a driver
Never heard of a 9 to 5er
Oh yes I'm fresh to death and in the club I'll be that fire

[Sugababes:]
I like them diamonds
Like a pirate looking for treasure I know how to find them
And you can best believe these boys they like to buy them
So give me what I need, that Gucci that Louis V
That's how you spell L.O.V.E wohoo

Ya pockets better be deep if with me you wanna creep
Nothing less than presidential suites awoho woho
Ya know I got a driver
Never heard of a 9 to 5er
Oh yes I'm fresh to death and in the club I'll be that fire

[Sugababes:]
I can get the men with a wave of my hand
It's like this magic in my fingers I don't understand
You buy me the world, if that would make me a Star
It's just the joy I bring
Call me Miss Everything!
