Can we call a truce? We both have our truths 
And I just wish this god damn mess... 
We could try and play it cool when it's going down 
I don't wanna fight 

Can we call a truce? We both have our truths 
And I just wish this God damn mess... 
We could try and play it cool 
I don't wanna fight, to lose you 

I wrote a list of my demands, but I left it at a friend's 
I rehearsed a little speech, but the whole thing got too preechy 
So it seems like I'm back on scratch again 
I read a magazine last night, all our issues came to light 
I memorised it piece by piece, but I guess it's not that easy 
Now it seems like I'm back on scratch again 

And it seems like in all the fighting we're losing sight 
And it feels like all this time we once were tight 
And it seems like we're supposed to be side by side 
All I wanna do is set things right 

Can we call a truce? We both have our truths 
And I just wish this god damn mess... 
We could try and play it cool when it's going down 
I don't wanna fight, I know I'm not right 

Can we call a truce? We both have our truths

I met you never asking sheer advice, to wise up and to make nice 
I always thought she was a bore, but then that's another story 
And I feel like I'm back on scratch again 
And at this show the other night I met your friend the skinny guy 
I swear he tried to make a pass, I guess he never was too classy 
And I feel like I'm back on scratch again 

And it seems like in all the fighting we're losing sight 
And it feels like all this time we once were tight 
And it seems like we're supposed to be side by side 
All I wanna do is set things right

If we can't reconcile then can we just not fight? 
Every second that you're gone I want you by my side 
Another minute with you not around, I just might lose my mind 
Was I wrong all the while or were you just not right? 
We're supposed to be side by side 
All I wanna do is set things right 

Can we call a truce? We both have our truths 
And I just wish this God damn mess... 
We could try and play it cool when it's going down
