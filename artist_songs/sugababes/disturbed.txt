Where's the hurt?
And what's it worth
And where's the ending proof?
Who am I?
I've realised
One and one make two

Be prepared
Stop running scared
Cos they are watching you
Yes they are watching you

I don't know what it is with me
I'm falling from my own two feet
I feel a bitter end in sight
Like a perfect world's been disturbed
I'm full of it but I can’t speak
How does a body get so weak?
No colour in my black and white
Do the deepest times get much worse?

Who's your friend?
No one else
Learned from one mistake
On your own
A precious stone
Left to wash away

Dim the lights
Down a wine
Who am I to blame?
Yeah who am I to blame?

I don't know what it is with me
I'm falling from my own two feet
I feel a bitter end in sight
Like a perfect world's been disturbed
I'm full of it but I can’t speak
How does a body get so weak?
No colour in my black and white
Do the deepest times get much worse?

My perfect world it has been disturbed

I don't know what it is with me
I'm falling from my own two feet
I feel a bitter end in sight
I'm full of it but I can’t speak
How's a body get so weak?
No colour in my black and white (Do the deepest times get much worse?)
