London let's go!
London let's go!
London let's go!
Sugababes let's go!

She got her red pumps, red purse
She gon' make some necks jerk tonight, eh
Hit the ATM, get that wad
She gon' party round the clock here tonight, eh

Went and got her car washed just so she can pull up like "what's up?"
("what's up?", "what's up?", "what's up?", "what's up?", "what's up?")
Now she and her girls 'bout to start a riot when they hit the club

And now they at the bar drinking...
BOTTLE AFTER BOTTLE AFTER BOTTLE AFTER BOTTLE, HEY!
BOTTLE AFTER BOTTLE AFTER BOTTLE AFTER...

She's such a mess
Up in that dress
She's sweating bullets
I'm not impressed
Her make-up's running
Her heels are broke
But that won't stop her
Watch her get messed up some m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-more

EVERYBODY GO MAD, EVERYBODY GO PSYCHO, PSYCHO, PSYCHO
EVERYBODY GO MAD, EVERYBODY GO PSYCHO, PSYCHO

It's two in the mornin' they ain't servin' no more alcohol tonight, eh
She's got a 4-seater filled with nine people she don't even know tonight, eh

'Bout to hit the after party
Tommorow she might be sorry but it's alright
(alright, alright, alright, alright, alright)
The sun is coming up but she's filling up her cup
Yeah that's right

And now she at the house drinking...

BOTTLE AFTER BOTTLE AFTER BOTTLE AFTER BOTTLE, HEY!
BOTTLE AFTER BOTTLE AFTER BOTTLE AFTER...

She's such a mess
Up in that dress
She's sweating bullets
I'm not impressed
Her make-up's running
Her heels are broke
But that won't stop her
Watch her get messed up some m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-more

EVERYBODY GO MAD, EVERYBODY GO PSYCHO, PSYCHO, PSYCHO
EVERYBODY GO MAD, EVERYBODY GO PSYCHO, PSYCHO

This is how them girls get down
Just another night in London town
They ain't trying to sober up - they keep drinking
Bottle after bottle after...
Champagnes flowing, music's going
A whole paycheck best believe she's blowing
Cause it's so hard to stop when you're ordering
Bottle after bottle...

She's such a mess
Up in that dress
She's sweating bullets
I'm not impressed
Her make-up's running
Her heels are broke
But that won't stop her
Watch her get messed up some m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-more

EVERYBODY GO MAD, EVERYBODY GO PSYCHO, PSYCHO, PSYCHO
EVERYBODY GO MAD, EVERYBODY GO PSYCHO, PSYCHO

She's such a mess
Up in that dress
She's such a mess
Up in that dress
