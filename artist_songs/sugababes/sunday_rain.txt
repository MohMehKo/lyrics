Standing on the platform 
Waiting for the train 
Watching the weather change 
I'm seeing shades of gray 

They say love's a many splendid thing 
We've made a mess of everything 
It's left me wondering... 

If it's just a picture, postcard 
Made to teach ya 
Some place that you're never gonna go 
Never gonna know 
You give all your heart and got nothing to show 

Days turn to nights 
And the nights never end 
You break my heart 
And i'll break yours 
That's how it goes 
It goes over and over and... 
And all that we are 
Is just playing a part 
In the game 
You know what they say... 
This ain't a day sun.. 
Oh it's called Sunday Rain 

Another tear drop falling down my face 
You stand there at the gate 
But I know I can not stay 
The part I hate 
Is standing here in the ashes of the fire 
Watching me pay the price of my desire 
You know i'm gonna go 
You're never gonna know 
I've givin' all 
And got nothing to show 

Days turn to nights (turn to nights) 
And the nights never end (never end) 
You break my heart (break my heart) 
And i'll break yours (i'll break your yours) 
That's how it goes 
It goes over and over and... 
And all that we are (all, that we are) 
Is just playing a part (a part) 
In the game 
You know what they say... (ohh) 
This ain't a day sun.. (day sun) 
Oh it's called Sunday Rain (sunday rain) 

Ohh... Ohh... (Ohh..) 

Days turn to nights (turn to nights) 
And the nights never end (no) 
You break my heart (break my heart) 
And i'll break yours (i'll break your yours) 
That's how it goes 
It goes over and over and... 
And all that we are (all, that we are) 
Is just playing a part (a part) (ohh..) 
In the game 
You know what they say... 
This ain't a day sun.. (day sun) 
Oh it's called Sunday Rain (sunday rain) 
Ohh..
