Yeah I'll wait, oh

I'll just wait, wait, wait
I'll just wait, wait wait

Feel your heart beating fast
Hold me close, make this last
We knew this day would come
Take a breath, breathe me in
I'm so scared, if you leave then
Wish we could both just run

Wish we could put it off, but we can't stop time
Seems the clock is running too fast
And now I'm feeling lost and I can read your mind
So you don't have to ask

You know I'll wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Yeah I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding on to

No matter how far, do you know I can't live without my heart?
I hope you come home soon (soon)
You know I'll wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Yeah I'll wait

Make some calls, I have to do
Write you letters just to prove 
You're the only thing on my mind
I know it's hard but we'll get through
Just hold on I promise you
Soon you'll be here by my side

Wish we could put it off, but we can't stop time
Seems like the clock is running way too fast
And now I'm feeling lost, I can read your mind
So you don't have to ask oh no

You know I'll wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Yeah I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding on to

No matter how far, do you know I can't live without my heart?
I hope you come home soon (soon)
You know I'll wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Yeah I'll wait

Oh, boy I'll wait

Feel my heart beating fast
Hold me close, make this last
We knew this day would come oh

You know I'll wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Yeah I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding on to

No matter how far, do you know I can't live without my heart?
I hope you come home soon (soon)
You know I'll wait for you (I'll wait)
If it takes a lifetime to do

Yeah I'll wait, wait, wait
I'll just wait, wait, wait
I'll just wait, wait, wait
I'll just wait, wait, wait (for you)

I'll just wait, wait, wait 
I'll just wait, wait, wait 
I'll just wait, wait, wait
I'll just wait, wait, wait
