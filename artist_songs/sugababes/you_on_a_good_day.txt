[Sugababes:] You on a good day 
[Keisha:] You messed up from your chromosomes to your enzymes 
Remember the time when you took my ride 

[Amelle:] I had to get it from the impound my favorite revision and later when I asked you bout it you just said yeah 

[Heidi:] But then at least you didn't crash if you had some cash left from selling my rims on the car parked behind the bar 

[Chorus:]
And baby that's you on a good day 
And baby that's you on a good day 
Disaster is always just a beat away 
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway 

[Heidi:]
You messed up like when I went to Tokyo for promotion and got back had a bill for two G's 

[Keisha:] From when you fell asleep calling me overseas asking bout my goal for the cash machine and you just said yeah 
[Amelle:] But you tried to keep the house key but then your new party friends went and called for some stripper and then I just said (fine) 

And baby that's you on a good day 
And baby that's you on a good day 
Disaster is always just a beat away 
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway 

And baby that's you on a good day 
And baby that's you on a good day 
Disaster is always just a beat away 
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway 
Keisha: I want it, I hate it, I need it 
I want it, want it, want it 
I hate it, I want it, I need it [x2]

[Amelle:] But you tried to keep the house key but then your new party friends went and called for some stripper
And then I just said (you're gonna make it up to me you know you are) 

And baby that's you on a good day 
And baby that's you on a good day 
Disaster is always just a beat away 
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway 

And baby that's you on a good day 
And baby that's you on a good day 
Disaster is always just a beat away 
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway
