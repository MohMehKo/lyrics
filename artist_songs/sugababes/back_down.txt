I like my man rough
I like my man tough
But he's gotta be smooth
When he's giving my love
I like my man clean
Like the cut of his jeans
It's like the Lord made
Tailored man for me
He's gotta smell good
Treat me like a man should
Keep his hair trimmed low
He's a friend of my soul
He keeps me secure
Makes me feel safe
And if you ever dare touch me
He'd have to put you in your place

'Cos my baby don't back down
My baby won't back down
'Cos he's alright, 'cos he's alright
My baby don't back down
No he never  back down
'Cos he's alright, 'cos he's alright

I like my man sexy
I like my man made
He knows what I want
He's the Ying to my Yang
I like my man patient
And his body real tight
Never keeps me waiting
That's just what I like
See these boys are no good
'Cos I need a real man
Someone who can keep me
In the palm of his hand
He's gotta treat me right
Never do me wrong
Better know how to please me
And turn me on

I know he'll never back down
My baby won't back down
'Cos he's alright, 'cos he's alright
My baby don't back down
My baby don't back down
'Cos he's alright, 'cos he's alright

I like my man cool
Much cooler than ice
And if I didn't meet him
I wouldn't have to blink twice
He gives me kisses by the hour
And when he bring me flowers
Never felt so sweet
When he's around me
He makes me smile
Instead of making me laugh
Never moves too slow
Doesn't move too fast
He's the love of my life
He's all that I need
And when he's with his friends
He's proud about me

'Cos my baby never back down
My baby don't back down
'Cos he's alright, 'cos he's alright
No my baby don't back down
My baby don't  back down
'Cos he's alright, 'cos he's alright

Break it down, break it down, break it down now
Break it down, break it down, break it down now
Break it down, break it down, break it down now
Break it down, break it down, break it down now
