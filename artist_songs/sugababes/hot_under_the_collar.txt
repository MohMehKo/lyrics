Hot under the collar
I bet you wanna take a little something off
So strip it down boy
You like the way my hips
They move up and down and dip
Got moisture on your lips
So strip it down boy

I won’t be offended 
If I was the one that had said that
You know that I’m down with that
I’m calling you, you’re invited
Boy this party’s bout to get private
I’ve got you hooked that’s a fact

Ooooh
The strobe light, it’s so bright
Let’s get under
Ooooh
Like starlight, it’s so bright
Strip it down now boy 

Coz I can see you getting hot under the collar
I bet you wanna take a little something off
So strip it down boy
You like the way my hips 
They move up and down and dip
If you wanna get with this
Strip it down boy

Watch me now baby
I’m gonna keep it real sexy
You won’t know how to react
And boy you know where it’s leading
Right into the gun and I’m freezing
I’m tempting you that’s a fact

Ooooh
The strobe light, it’s so bright
Let’s get under
Ooooh
Like starlight, it’s so bright
Strip it down now boy 

Keep your eyes on me
Keep imagining
Keep your eyes on me
Keep imagining
Now it’s time I head my way

Ooooh
The strobe light, it’s so bright
Let’s get under
Ooooh
Like starlight, it’s so bright
Strip it down now boy 

Coz I can see you getting hot under the collar
I bet you wanna take a little something off
So strip it down boy
You like the way my hips 
They move up and down and dip
If you wanna get with this
Strip it down boy

Strip it down boy
