Yeah, oooh, yeah yeah yeah yeah, ohh

I'm standing in the club, doing my own thing
When you thought you would approach me (hey, hey)
Saying things that you shouldn't be
I'm not your average girl
You can't put your hands on this
So I move to my right
Stay out my sight
Ooh don't trip

So what's that scratching around here
Cos I feel a messy atmosphere
You never gonna get my love
Is that clear? (ooh yeah)
You can't creep up to me fool
I'm too focused to lose my cool
See you from a mile away, ohh

[Chorus:]
Buster trying to get his hands on me
Spinning a line to get me in a taxi
Not that easy can't you understand (NO!)
You ain't getting a thing (NO!)
Buster trying to some dirty
Trying to simulate a fantasy
Not that easy can't you understand (NO!)
I'll repeat it again (NO!)

A negative response is all that you're gonna get
But now I'm too turned off
You ain't gonna flip my switch
Cos I'm not your average girl
I'm not gonna take your game
So I move to the left
Shadow my step
Ain't got no shame

So what's that scratching around here
Cos I feel a messy atmosphere
Never gonna get my love
Is that clear? (ooh)
You can't creep up to me fool
I'm too focused to lose my cool
See you from a mile away, oohh

[Chorus:]
Buster trying to get his hands on me
Spinning a line to get me in a taxi
Not that easy can't you understand (NO!)
You ain't getting a thing (NO!)
Buster trying to some dirty
Trying to simulate a fantasy
Not that easy can't you understand (NO!)
Should I'll repeat it again (NO!)

Ice, cool I wanna melt you down
Buster I've seen your type around
Your sting, you know you it can't get me on down
Bound bound b-b-b-bound bound
I can feel you playa suckin up the atmosphere
Trying to get me home but I thought I told you (NO!)
But I thought I told you (NO!)
B-b-but I thought I told you

[Chorus:]
Buster trying to get his hands on me (in a taxi)
Spinning a line to get me in a taxi
Hey, all me (NO!)
You ain't getting a thing (NO!)
Buster trying to some dirty
Trying to simulate a fantasy
Not that easy can't you understand (NO!)
Should I'll repeat it again? (NO!)

[Chorus:]
Buster trying to get his hands on me
Spinning a line to get me in a taxi
Not that easy can't you understand (NO!)
You ain't getting a thing (NO!)
Buster trying to some dirty
Trying to simulate a fantasy
Not that easy can't you understand (NO!)
Should I'll repeat it again (NO!)
