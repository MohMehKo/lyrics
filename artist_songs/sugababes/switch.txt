He's nothing special
Don't need his dough
Settling down what is that a joke
You're feeling his best friend 
Your ex bores you
'Cos he started to ignore you

He starts his speech
Tell him not to preach
Always talking out of his ass
What's the point of that
He's not on your level
Like the new man
The fly man
The man who really understands

Remember a good way
To get out of an old thing
Is to jump into a new thing and

Switch
If you don't deliver
You just ditch
Grab another lover
Scratch your itch
From dusk 'til dawning
Until that new guy has you yawning
Switch
If he don't please you
You just ditch
Find someone to tease you
Makes you itch
Freaks you 'til the morning
Until this new guy has you yawning

Same old thing the TV
The video, he's got to know
Conversations growing old
You've heard those jokes
They're cold
Could he think that the kiss on the text
Means a pizza
Then action attraction
He's got it all wrong

Remember a good way
To get out of an old thing
Is to jump into a new thing and

Switch
If you don't deliver
You just ditch
Grab another lover
Scratch your itch
From dusk 'til dawning
Until that new guy has you yawning
Switch
If he don't please you
You just ditch
Find someone to tease you
Makes you itch
Freaks you 'til the morning
Until this new guy has you yawning

Hanging around on borrowed time
One strike out
You ain't mine
So just get your style in check
I move one ex to the next
Everything he does beats you
So I'm jumping another queue
Please just get your style in check
I move one ex to the next
