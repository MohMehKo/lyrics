You telling me 
That I don't look the same as I used to
Could it be 
At times the only blame for our issues 
I wanna know
Can't go no longer being neglected 
Knowing that your heart has changed

Reminiscing on the times
Looking at the photos
Oh we were so happy then
Taking walks out in the park
Enjoying the sun
And I was you're only one
And we were like the closest friends

Back when
We used to talk about everything
Now it seems you're not listening
Winter nights are colder than usual
And Summer time is just not the same
What happened to the love back when

You promised me 
We'd plant the seed to love and let it grow
Now it seems
That you don't even water it no more
'Cos it seems
The leaves have hit the ground and faded
Now the trees don't look the same

Reminiscing on the times
Looking at the photos
Oh we were so happy then
Taking walks out in the park
Enjoying the sun
And I was you're only one
And we were like the closest friends

Back when
We used to talk about everything
Now it seems you're not listening
Winter nights are colder than usual
And Summer time is just not the same
What happened to the love back when

We used to talk about everything
Now it seems you're not listening
Winter nights are colder than usual
And Summer time is just not the same
What happened to the love back when

You told me that you love me
And now it seems to me we're two strangers
That's falling apart, and I know
Nothing in life is guarenteed
So if you wanna move along then move alone

Back when
We used to talk about everything
Now it seems you're not listening
Winter nights are colder than usual
And Summer time is just not the same
What happened to the love back when

We used to talk about everything
Now it seems you're not listening
Winter nights are colder than usual
And Summer time is just not the same
What happened to the love back when
