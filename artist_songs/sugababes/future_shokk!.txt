[INTRO:]
Future, future, future shokk! 
Future, future, future shokk! 
Future shokk, shokk, shokk! 
Let's go 

[VERSE 1:]
I know you got the feeling 
With you and I, together
We can hit the ceiling 
But only if you come 
With X amount of feeling 
’Cause I don’t want a man 
Who can't understand 
(Get up, get up and jerk that body) 
This is all about the future 
Not a drop of water
For the wallflower (ooh!)
Coming with that dirty
Funky, solar power 
If you stay calm 
Then ring the alarm (woo!)

[CHORUS:]
I just wanna see 
All the people going crazy 
Bugging out off key 
To the melody 
Without a doubt 
This is an emergency 
So scream and shout 
Get up, get up and jerk that body 
Bass line – sick or what? (Bass line)
This got every one of us (oh, yeah)
Now twist it up
Hitting it with a future shokk! 
Don't wanna stop 
This is an emergency 
Show what you got 

Get up, get up and jerk that body 
Get up, get up and jerk that body 
(Get up, get up and jerk that body) 
Get up, get up and jerk that body 
Get up, get up and jerk that body 
(Get up, get up and jerk that body) 
(Jerk that body) 

[VERSE 2:]
Feeling something gets 
A flush flowing through my mind 
You gotta see these moves 
This ain't no silly groove 
Move your body to the bass 
Don't let the rhythm die 
(Future shokk!) 
Just keep it burning all night 
There ain't nothing in this what I wouldn’t do (oh, no)
Just watch the crowd do what you wanna do-o
This hype is moving 
It's grooving 
You're choosing 
The person to 
Get up and dance with you! 

[CHORUS:]
I just wanna see 
All the people going crazy 
Bugging out off key (oh, yeah)
To the melody 
Without a doubt (yeah) 
This is an emergency 
So scream and shout 
Get up, get up and jerk that body! 
Bass line – sick or what?
This got every one of us (hey)
Now twist it up
Hitting it with a future shokk! (Ooh!) 
Don't wanna stop 
This is an emergency 
Show what you got 

Get up, get up and jerk that body! 
Get up, get up and jerk that body 
(Get up, get up and jerk that body) 
Get up, get up and jerk that body 
(Get up, get up and jerk that body!) 
Get up, get up and jerk that body (yeah)
(Get up, get up and jerk that body) (yeah)

[BRIDGE:]
What you fighting for?
No more gun and war 
Makes you sick or what? 
Everyone of us (ooh)
It's a future shokk! 
I don't ever wanna stop 
Show me what you got 
I'm ready to go 

[MALE SOLO:]
I know you got that feeling 
You and I we could hit the ceiling 
You and I and the wheels of steel and 
Good omen, moments revealing 
That funky solar power 
Cool off and take that shower 
You come now, ring the alarm 
Head rush with that twisted charm, c’mon 

[REPEAT VERSE 1:]

Show what you got 
Get up, get up and jerk that body! 

[CHORUS:]
