I guess I saw through you
I've seen your colours blue
Tryin' to join me when I'm on top
Observing what I do
But then you weren't around
I was down and in the ground
Do you remember shut your mouth
Don't wanna hear your sound
Don't you try it

I'm not so forgetful
Your colours are rather dull
It's never gona be
That picture that you want
Of being seen

Blue
That's all you do
Play with people's minds
Two faced
I wasn't blind
I wasn't so blue
Blue
You are a fool because you lost me
I thought that we were cool

Blue and that is deep
I can't be asked
Blue and that is you and that's too long
Blue
Don't you see your colours wrong
You've been there far too long
I see it going on
You've been faking
Trying to be my friend
When all along you were out there
Trying to set a trend
I've, I've only got one word for you
And every word is true
The colour that suits you is blue

You are sleazy and two faced
I can't believe I missed
What you were all about
Trying to use me but your game ran out
You can't take advantage of me
My eyes are open now
Trying to use me to get into my crowd
You're all about the hype
When you see me on TV
Two weeks later talking my name
You're the one to blame
Then you try and dress likeme
Talk like me
Are you crazy?
Why are you trying to claim
For you I've only got one name

Blue
That's all you do
Play with people's minds
Two faced
I wasn't blind
I wasn't so blue
Blue
You are a fool because you lost me
I thought that we were cool

Blue and that is deep
I can't be asked
Blue and that is you and that's too long
Blue
Don't you see your colours wrong
You've been there far too long
I see it going on
You've been faking
Trying to be my friend
When all along you were out there
Trying to set a trend
I've, I've only got one word for you
And every word is true
The colour that suits you is blue

You think you're too heavy
Trying mess don't fk with me
Can't you see that your games run out
In the beginning all you did was doubt
Didn't know that I'd catch your game
Couldn't fit in my crew anyway
Now if you don't know
I'm agive you a clue
You're lame
You're broke
Let the fellas take a stroke
Of the skit that you are
Use the fellas for the cars
Use me for my bra
And she thought you would scar
Hell no, I'm selling records
Got no time for the haters
Got them shook up with my lyrics
When I'm fluffin' with my digits
Wanna hate me
Wanna be me
Got me vexed
Got me so angry
Cos I'm doing my dream
Don't screw so blue

Blue and that is deep
I can't be asked
Blue and that is you and that's too long
Blue
Don't you see your colours wrong
You've been there far too long
I see it going on
You've been faking
Trying to be my friend
When all along you were out there
Trying to set a trend
I've, I've only got one word for you
And every word is true
The colour that suits you is blue
