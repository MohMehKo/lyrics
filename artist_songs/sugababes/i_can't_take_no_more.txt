Take me, why don't you take me
Now I got you all alone
Maybe I'll show you baby how to take control
It's been a while since you've been on the prowl
It's your chance to have me now
I'm so caught up by the thought of you yeah

Save me
'Cause I'm about to go crazy
I know they're watching, it don't phase me
'Cause boy you got me so tenderly

(I can't take it no more) I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more (I can't take it no more)
I can't take it no more 
I can't take it no more (I can't take it no more)
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
And this feeling I got to explore, baby tonight

You see me on the dancefloor
I wanna show you some more
A private lesson behind closed doors
Now we can take this slowly
How much do you wanna know me?
But boy you do not own me
Feel the heat (Feel the heat)
Now we've got this started
Tell me just how you want it
So I can be all that you dreamed and more
Now after all this talking
You got me feeling something
I'm running out of patience
I just wanna take you

Save me
'Cause I'm about to go crazy
I know they're watching, it don't phase me
'Cause boy you got me so tenderly

(I can't take it no more) I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more (I can't take it no more)
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more (I can't take it no more)
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
And this feeling I got to explore, baby tonight

(I can't take it no more) I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more (I can't take it no more)
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more (I can't take it no more)
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
And this feeling I got to explore, baby tonight

(I can't take it no more) I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more (I can't take it no more)
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more (I can't take it no more)
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
And this feeling I got to explore, baby tonight
