She likes to dress like she's fresh out of a magazine
She struts around getting down to her record machine
It's clear that she enjoys teasing all the boys
They always say that you'll remember her name
Because she's got it, she's got it right down

And all the guys say

I need 3 spoons of suga and a glassful of liqueur to get over you
Give me something in my coffe, give me thrills, take my money
Can't get over you

He don't get stressed 'cos he's blessed with the cut of his jeans
He looking tight washed superfine
If you know what I mean
He clearly gets his kicks getting messy with the chicks
They always say that you'll remember his name
Because he's got it, he's got it so so down

And all the girls say

I need 3 spoons of suga and a glassful of liqueur to get over you
Give me something in my coffe, give me thrills, take my money
Can't get over you
I'm gonna need a whole lotta therapy to cure this sugarush
I can't get over you
Give me something in my coffee, give me thrills, take my money
Can't get over you

And all the girls say

I need 3 spoons of suga and a glassful of liqueur to get over you
Give me something in my coffe, give me thrills, take my money
Can't get over you
I'm gonna need a whole lotta therapy to cure this sugarush
I can't get over you
Give me something in my coffee, give me thrills, take my money
Can't get over you
