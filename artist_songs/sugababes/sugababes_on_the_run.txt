Time to turn up the fun y'all fun ya'll (shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it)
Sugababes on the run y'all run ya'll (shake it, shake it, shake it shake it)
Time to turn up the fun y'all fun ya'll (shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it)
Sugababes on the run y'all run ya'll (shake it, shake it, shake it shake it)

They say that I'm too young to rave
And my kerf is 12
But I don't wanna stay inside
While they enjoy themselves
My friends are talking
Feel like I'm missing out
On what they're doing
Not much longer

Bounce up and down with my older friends (older friends)
The over 18s where the party never ends
It's not like the ladies have got the problems
So at least 19 they pushing their benz
Never too old can you work and live with that
Young and free and I want it like that
And I ain't giving it up

It's hard growing up so fast
Trying hard to make my childhood last forever
All the fellas trying to make a pass
I'm still trying to make it last forever

They say that I'm too young
To have any boyfriends
But if I was to met someone
Would you stop me
I'm ain't too young
To understand
You know the game
I'm telling you

Bounce up and down with my older friends (older friends)
The over 18s where the party never ends
It's not like the ladies have got the problems
So at least 19 they pushing their benz
Never too old can you work and live with that
Young and free and I want it like that
And I ain't giving it up

It's hard growing up so fast
Trying hard to make my childhood last forever
All the fellas trying to make a pass
I'm still trying to make it last forever

It's hard growing up so fast
Trying hard to make my childhood last forever
All the fellas trying to make a pass
I'm still trying to make it last forever

Time to turn up the fun y'all fun ya'll (shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it)
Sugababies on the run y'all run ya'll (shake it, shake it, shake it shake it)
Time to turn up the fun y'all fun ya'll (shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it)
Sugababies on the run y'all run ya'll (shake it, shake it, shake it shake it)
