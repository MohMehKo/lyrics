She's my everything 
Like a morning girl 
She's my angel up above my world 
She's the only one who understands me 
That's why I call her my new fan league 

She's the only one that I want by my side 
She's the only one that I believe can save my life 
She makes me want to be a better man oh why 
She's higher than the sky 
The suns and the moon 

She's like a star, like a star, like a star 
She's like a star, like a star, like a star 
She's like a star, like a star, like a star 
She's like a star, like a star, like a star 

Well you inspired me, to chase my wildest dreams 
You mezmorized my world, I'll be your favorite girl 
Like a melody, you release me, just like the greatest song 
You are my number one 

He's the only one I wat by my side 
He's the only one I want by my side 
He's the only one that I believe can save my life 
He makes me want to be a better girl or wife 

Hey, she higher than the sky the suns and the moon 

She's like a star, like a star, like a star. 
Oh baby, hes like a star 
Ooh baby, shes like a star
