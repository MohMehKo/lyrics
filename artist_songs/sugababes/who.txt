Every minute passes by 
You're always talking 
Makes me cry 
Finding out the reasons why 
I'm needing space get out my ride 
Talking about what I do, where I go, who I'm with and why I don't bring you 
Think about the times you pushed me 
Saying "baby please don't go" 
You make me sick 
Yeah, yeah 

I'll make you lost in 
Times before you break my small 
You claim you love me, tease me, leave me, hold me, please me 
Get off I'm movin on 
Cos I'm tryin to take control 

[Chorus:]
But it's you talking dirty 
When I'm trying to sleep 
And it's you, said you love me 
After just one week 
Tell me who's always calling on my telephone 
Now it's you tryin to tell me 
We should take things slow 

And you said: "don't go, don't go, please don't go 
Please don't leave me, on my own 
Don't go, don't go, please don't go 
Please don't leave me, on my own" 

You're creepin, sneaking, cheating, on me 
Leavin, this round, 
Gotta end the strike cos it ain't going down 
Now you wanna come back, claim you give me a track 
I forgive what you do then you want it back 
I'm sick of playing this game 
I ain't sticking with a claim fame 
Stop this, right now 
You crossed the line so baby get the hell out 

[Chorus:]
But it's you talking dirty 
When I'm trying to sleep 
And it's you, said you love me 
After just one week (just one week yeah) 
Tell me who's always calling on my telephone 
Now it's you tryin to tell me 
We should take things slow (take things slow) 

[Chorus:]
But it's you talking dirty 
When I'm trying to sleep (yeah) 
And it's you, said you love me 
After just one week (just one week yeah yeah) 
Tell me who's always calling on my telephone (telephone) 
Now it's you tryin to tell me 
We should take things slow (take things slow) 

And you said: "don't go, don't go, please don't go (no) 
Please don't leave me, on my own (please don't) 
Don't go, don't go, please don't go (oh) 
Please don't leave me, on my own" (on my own) 

Make up your mind boy 
Silly games you're always playing 
Have no time boy 
To sit and chase you 
I ain't staying 
Well, thinking it's funny 
Well, you're spending money 
And, every time you wanna get the upper hand remember 
I'll be walking away looking cool with my 
Matching bag and the jewels that I took 
Don't you ever say it's not necessary 
Then beg to come back 
I ain't having that 
Ooh whoa 

[Chorus:]
But it's you talking dirty 
When I'm trying to sleep 
And it's you, said you love me 
After just one week 
Tell me who's always calling on my telephone 
Now it's you tryin to tell me 
We should take things slow (take things slow) 

[Chorus:]
But it's you talking dirty 
When I'm trying to sleep 
And it's you, said you love me 
After just one week (just one week) 
Tell me who's always calling on my telephone 
(Yes it's you) Now it's you tryin to tell me 
We should take things slow (take things slow) 

And you said: "don't go, don't go (don't go), please don't go (oh no) 
Please don't leave me (on my own), on my own 
Don't go, don't go (don't go), please don't go (oh no) 
Please don't leave me, on my own" (on my own)
