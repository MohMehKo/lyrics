Don't recognize what I see
Who is this looking back at me
I just can't tell
I see the pale reflection of myself

Can't cover up the way I feel
This scars you left will never heal
What can I do
Am I supposed to just forget you?

Torn up, got my fingers burned
Now I'm so lost, got a lot to learn
I wanna free myself, be someone else
But there's nowhere left to turn

Tell me, who are you gonna run to?
Where are you gonna hide?
There's so much you gotta undo
But there's nothing left inside

Tell me, who's gonna make it better?
When there's so much going wrong
Will I feel this way forever
Or am I stronger now you're gone

Am I stronger now you're gone, yeah?

Wish I could change who I am
Be someone who don't give a damn
There's too much to take
'Cause my heart is set to break down

I can't pretend anymore
That things will be like they were before
Why can't you see
It's just a fading memory

Torn up, got my fingers burned
Now I'm so lost, got a lot to learn
I wanna free myself, be someone else
But there's nowhere left to turn

Tell me, who are you gonna run to?
Where are you gonna hide?
There's so much you gotta undo
But there's nothing left inside

Tell me, who's gonna make it better?
When there's so much going wrong
Will I feel this way forever
Or am I stronger now you're gone

Am I stronger now you're gone?

What can I do to make it trough
It's only me, why can't I see
I'm not to blame, it's such a shame
It's only me

Tell me, who are you gonna run to?
Where are you gonna hide?
There's so much you gotta undo
But there's nothing left inside

Tell me, who's gonna make it better?
When there's so much going wrong
Will I feel this way forever
Or am I stronger now you're gone

Why can't I see?

There's so much you gotta undo
But there's nothing left inside

Tell me, who's going to make it better?
When there's so much going wrong
Will I feel this way forever
Or am I stronger now you're gone
