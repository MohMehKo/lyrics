Honestly, can I say what I mean
Don't you play with me
Cos I'm a lady

When I look in your eyes
I can see through your charm
You're constantly twisted
I'm angry, alarmed
Your poison has taken control of my soul
But I won't say no more
And I won't take no more

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I wonder where this feeling began
Deep in my heart right from the start
Tired and lonely I'll move on from this pain
I'm starting again I'm breaking the chain

Emotionally, it takes all of me
Apologies, but you don't really have a hold on me

There's a distance between us
And you take the blame
I know that you try but
At the stage of the game
I've started a new life
There's no turning back
With you now, don't you know, can't you see I got over

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I wonder where this feeling began
Deep in my heart right from the start
Tired and lonely I'll move on from this pain
I'm starting again I'm breaking the chain

Had to take matters into my own hands
Falling this deep wasn't part of my plans
If turning this around is what I have to do
To get through to you
My fire's burnt out it's true

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I wonder where this feeling began
Deep in my heart right from the start
Tired and lonely I'll move on from this pain
I'm starting again I'm breaking the chain
