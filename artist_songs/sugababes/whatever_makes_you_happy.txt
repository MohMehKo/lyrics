You ain't gotta make it hard if it's easy
Applying pressure on the wound when it's bleeding
Hangin' with the guys cos it's just cool being me
Too much talking from the girls drive me crazy

You're telling me your definition of a pop star
You give a smile as you cover up your heart
So tell me what to say and I'll deliver it
I won't stop, can't stop, cos I'm living it

[Chorus:]
Whatever makes you happy
Is it crazy to be happy?
Cos it's doing it for me
Is it making you crazy that I'm happy?
Lately, you ain't doing it for me

Now let me break it down
Tell you what it means to me
I don't wanna spend my time in the VIP
I gotta meet someone who doesn't need publicity
Cos your style is....
And you can justify everything
But it don't really matter when reality kicks in
So tell me what to say and I'll deliver it
I won't stop, can't stop, cos I'm living it

[Chorus:]
Whatever makes you happy
Is it crazy to be happy?
Cos it's doing it for me
Is it making you crazy that I'm happy?
Lately, you ain't doing it for me
(You ain't doing it for me)

So whatever makes you happy
Is it crazy to be happy?
Cos it's doing it for me
Is it making you crazy that I'm happy?
Lately, you ain't doing it for me
(You ain't doing it for me)

I'm finding out I don't wanna be in this place
Cos it's about the music, not the fame

[Chorus:]
So whatever makes you happy
Is it crazy to be happy?
Cos it's doing it for me (cos it's doing it for me)
Is it making you crazy that I'm happy?
Lately, you ain't doing it for me
(You ain't doing it for me)

So whatever makes you happy
Is it crazy to be happy?
Cos it's doing it for me
Is it making you crazy (crazy) that I'm happy (happy)?
Lately, you ain't doing it for me
(You ain't doing it for me)

So whatever makes you happy
Is it crazy to be happy?
Cos it's doing it for me
