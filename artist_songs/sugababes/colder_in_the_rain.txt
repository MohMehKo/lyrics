Feeling confused about the things that i have seen
Nothing seems to be real everything's a dream
Which causes me to question
What life really means

This is our world
Can't take no more
I'm breaking, help me
Tell me where to go
In time I'm gonna find my own sweet way

My tears will dry
I don't know why
It's getting colder in the rain
But the summertime
Got left behind
And there's no one else to blame

Sitting here thinking about the place we're going to
Not knowing where or what might happen if we both flew
Even though I know I've made mistakes
I will learn from every one

This is awful
Can't take no more
I'm breaking, help me
Tell me where to go
In time I'm gonna find my own sweet way

My tears will dry
I don't know why
It's getting colder in the rain
But the summertime
Got left behind
And there's no one else to blame

My tears will dry (Tears will dry)
I don't know why
It's getting colder in the rain (Colder in the rain)
But the summertime
Got left behind
And there's no one else to blame (Yeah)

And there's no one else to blame...

My tears will dry (My tears will dry)
I don't know why
It's getting colder in the rain (Colder in the rain)
But the summertime (Summertime)
Got left behind
And there's no one else to blame (No one else to blame)

My tears will dry (my tears will dry)
I don't know why (I don't know why)
It's getting colder in the rain (Colder in the rain)
But the summertime (Summertime)
Got left behind (Got left behind)
And there's no one else to blame (There's no one else to blame)

My tears will dry (yeah)
I don't know why (I don't know)
It's getting colder in the rain (Colder in the rain)
But the summertime (Summertime)
Got left behind (Got left behind)
And there's no one else to blame (Ooh-ooh)
