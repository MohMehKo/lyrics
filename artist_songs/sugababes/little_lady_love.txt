I'm little lady love
I've been touched from above
And you just can't get enough
Of little lady love

I'm little lady love
I've been touched from above
And you just can't get enough
Of little lady love

We maybe young
But only for a while
I may look brave
But boy that's just my style
Taken from my teens
But feeding from the tears
Falling with the love
I've holding back the years

I'm little lady love
I've been touched from above
And you just can't get enough
Of little lady love

The miracle of love
Is something I've observed
And speaking for myself
Is something I'll preserve
Until I feel my way
Along the sticky road
I'll save the miracle
I'm gonna take it slow

I'm little lady love
I've been touched from above
And you just can't get enough
Of little lady love

Lady love, lady love
Lady love, lady love
Lady love, lady love
Lady love, lady love, love

I think I've been separate
Makes it so desperate
I think I'll moderate
Better to wait, it's favourite

I'm little lady love
I've been touched from above
And you just can't get enough
Of little lady love

I'm little lady love
I've been touched from above
And you just can't get enough
Of little lady love

Lady love, lady love
I've been touched from above
And you just can't get enough
Of little lady love

I'm little lady love
I've been touched from above
And you just can't get enough
Of little lady love

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
