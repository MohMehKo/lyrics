I’m the most responsible girl that I know
Never late, always on time for the show
Ask anyone around me
And they’ll tell you just how I am, yeah

I try to tell the truth every chance that I get
I never let the work I’m doing get to my head
And when it came to love
I thought I gave it the best I had, yeah

But somewhere I missed, somewhere I slipped
Somewhere, there’s a couple steps that I skipped
Somehow, I told myself I didn’t need anyone

But look at me now
I was so busy telling everyone
How good life is now that you’re gone
Now, it’s so hard to be out on my own
So, why do I feel so alone?
How could I get this all wrong?
I guess that ‘Little Miss Perfect’
Wasn’t that perfect after all

Now everything around me
Feels out of place
Like all four walls are closing in
And there’s no escape

Everyday spent without you
It gets harder to act like I’m okay
If I could take back the things that I said
If I could un-break all that we had
I’d put all the pieces back together again

But look at me now
I was so busy telling everyone
How good life is now that you’re gone
Now, it’s so hard to be out on my own
So, why do I feel so alone?
How could I get this all wrong?
I guess that ‘Little Miss Perfect’
Wasn’t that perfect after all

The world that I know is all crashing down
And it’s the biggest shock to me
‘Cause I thought I had it all figured out
So, why does my heart feel empty?
Oh

I thought it was perfect
But it wasn’t so perfect

But look at me now
I was so busy telling everyone
How good life is now that you’re gone
Now, it’s so hard to be out on my own
So, why do I feel so alone?
How could I get this all wrong?
I guess that ‘Little Miss Perfect’
Wasn’t that perfect after all
