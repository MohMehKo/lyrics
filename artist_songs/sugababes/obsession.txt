You are an obsession I cannot sleep
I am a possession unopened at your feet
Theres no balance no equality
But still I will not except defeat

I will have you yes I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you
Like a butterfly
A wild butterfly I will collect and capture you

You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me [x2]

I feed you I drink you my day and my night
I need you I need you by sun or candlelight
You protest, you wanna leave
Stay, oh, there's no alternative

Your face appears again
I see the beauty there
But I see danger, stranger beware
A circumstance in your naked dreams
You reflection is not what it seems

You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me [x2]

My fantasy has turned to madness
And all my goodness has turned to badness
My need to possess you has consumed my soul
My life is trembling I have no control

I will have you yes I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you
Like a butterfly oh a butterfly
I will collect you and capture you

You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me
