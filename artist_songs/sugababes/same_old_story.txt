You had love for me
You said that you'd give me everything
What's happening?
How could you lie how could you be so trifflin'
What's going on?
Coz I thought that you where the only one
Don't even waste my time, oh ho

It was a shock to see
Telling me lies disgusted me
You wasn't right for me
I've had enough of your lies trying to talk to me
Are you outta mind
Do you think i'll mind
Don't even waste my time

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hear "I'm sorry"
Don't wanna hear the same old story
Whatever it ain't my problem
You ain't gonna waste my time
Baby can't you see that I
Don't need you in my life
Please can you see the sign
You ain't gonna waste my time

You've been running games behind my back
Don't you relise I won't take that
Baby this is where you get of
I'm moving in onnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn

Telling me the same old story
Everyday the same old story
Why you talking big for me
You ain't gonna waste my time
(Can you see the signs)
Baby can you see that I
Don't need you in my life
Can you see the signs
You ain't gonna waste my time

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hear "I'm sorry"
Don't wanna hear the same old story
Whatever it ain't my problem
You ain't gonna waste my time
Baby can't you see that I
Don't need you in my life
Please can you see the sign
You ain't gonna waste my time

Same old story
Same old story
Ain't my problem

Yeah, yeah
