Maya this song's for you
I have your name print tattooed upon my skin
There's so much to say to you
And where do I begin?

Cos all these prayers must be going somewhere
Somewhere I can never trace
But it seems so far look in the stars
And the empty space

[Chorus:]
There are worlds within worlds, that keep rotating
And so many thoughts that flow through my mind
If this universe is really shrinking
We'll be together in time

I had a vision of this place
It looked like heaven but the colours seemed to change
And no matter what I do yeah
It's slowly fading away

So all of these prayers have to be going somewhere
Somewhere I can never trace
And one could get lost in all of these stars
And drift in space

[Chorus:]
There are worlds within worlds, that keep rotating
And so many thoughts that flow through my mind
If this universe is really shrinking
We'll be together in time

[Chorus:]
There are worlds within worlds, that keep rotating
And so many thoughts that flow through my mind
If this universe is really shrinking
We'll be together in time

[Chorus:]
There are worlds within worlds, that keep rotating
And so many thoughts that flow through my mind
If this universe is really shrinking
We'll be together in time
