Oooh, oooh, ooh
Oooooh yeah

I don't know how many times we've walked the streets
Talking for ages, about the people we're gonna be
We've been waiting for a change
But I don't mind if you don't change baby
Though it might seem crazy
But I'm happy with you this way

Oh don't you know that
You're a part of my heart
And these emotions that I got from the start
Are still with me babe
And I'm tripping up over my words to say

No-one ever told me life could be this sweet
Breathing easy
Breathing easy 
It's time we shoud be giving in
No-one ever told me life could be this sweet
Breathing easy
Breathing easy

We talk about the places that we intend to be
But if we were there would you be you
And baby would I be me?
I don't want to be somewhere and realise this feeling's gone
I'm lost in these tenses
Confusing my senses
Tomorrow is taking too long

Don't you know that
You're a part of my heart
And these emotions that I got from the start
Are still with me babe
And I'm tripping up over my words to say

No-one ever told me life could be this sweet (no-one ever told me)
Breathing easy (breathing easy) (so sweet)
Breathing easy (breathing easy) (so so sweet)
It's time we shoud be giving in
No-one ever told me life could be this sweet (no one ever told me) (so
sweet)
Breathing (ooh) easy
Breathing, (oh) easy (I)

If I was a little wiser maybe
I wouldn't leave this focus-out lens
Out of this moment too long
I gotta find my way home

No-one ever told me life could be this sweet (be so sweet)
Breathing easy (I know)
Breathing easy (I know this life's so sweet)
It's time we shoud be giving in
No-one ever told me life could be this sweet (easy) (so sweet)
Breathing easy (breathing easy) (I know)
Breathing (breathing) (breathing) (no one ever told me)
It's time we shoud be giving in

No-one ever told me life could be this sweet (be so sweet)
Breathing easy (breathing easy, hey)
Breathing easy (breathing easy) (so sweet)
It's time we shoud be giving in
No-one ever told me life could be this sweet (so sweet)
Breathing easy, breathing easy
