It's OK, to go and make mistakes
It's OK, to break your promises
You're moving on anyway
I hate the way
It makes me feel inside
You promised me
You'd be all that I need
I wonder why you lied

[Chorus]
Promises you made, coming back to haunt you
Don't whisper in my ear you gotta learn to say goodbye
I was in the wrong, but it doesn't really matter
Don't whisper in my ear
You gotta learn to say goodbye

You gave me time
To think about you and me
I hate the way you make me feel inside
I wonder why you lie

[Chorus]
Promises you made coming back to haunt you
Don't whisper in my ear you gotta learn to say goodbye
I was in the wrong, but it doesn't really matter
Don't whisper in my ear
You gotta learn to say goodbye

(Duh-dah) I was breathing coz that's that the gauge was indicating
While was blaming I was soon to be so implicated
Now i'm through with all the lies and pictures are back-dated
Almost lost my friendly feet coz boy i'm operating (uh-uh)

[Chorus]
Promises you made coming back to haunt you
Don't whisper in my ear you gotta learn to say goodbye
I was in the wrong, but it doesn't really matter
Don't whisper in my ear
You gotta learn to say goodbye

[Chorus]
Promises you made coming back to haunt you
Don't whisper in my ear you gotta learn to say goodbye
I was in the wrong, but it doesn't really matter
Don't whisper in my ear
You gotta learn to say goodbye

[Chorus]
Promises you made coming back to haunt you
Don't whisper in my ear you gotta learn to say goodbye
I was in the wrong, but it doesn't really matter
Don't whisper in my ear
You gotta learn to say goodbye

[Chorus]
Promises you made coming back to haunt you
Don't whisper in my ear you gotta learn to say goodbye
I was in the wrong, but it doesn't really matter
Don't whisper in my ear
You gotta learn to say goodbye
