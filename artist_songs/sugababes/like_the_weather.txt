Rain dropping down on my skin
And I'm drowning here inside
Like I'm caught in the wind
And the movement of the tide
It makes me shiver...

Sun crashing in on my heart
My emotions flipping round
Seasons end, as they stop
Every time you let me down
It's never over...

Boy I never know which way to turn
Am I safe in this place?
Cause I can't seem to trust what I feel
It's so confuzing...

Fast like a hurricane 
That's how my feelings change 
Torn between sun and rain
I love you like the weather

Always the 2 extremes 
Theres nothing inbetween
Its either black or white
I love you like the weather...

In this dilemma again
And my heart is on the run
No one knows who to blame
And the story is undone
It's never over...

Boy I never know which way to turn
Am I safe in this place?
Cause I can't seem to trust what I feel
It's so confuzing

Fast like a hurricane
That's how my feelings change
Torn between sun and rain. 
I love you like the weather

Always the 2 extremes
Theres nothing inbetween
Its either black or white
I love you like the weather...

I hate you, I love you
I can't be without you
Is it wrong or is it right?

I fall into nights
I keep crossing the line
Guess I'm only human...

Fast like a hurricane
That's how my feelings change
Torn between sun and rain. 
I love you like the weather

Always the 2 extremes
There's nothing inbetween
Its either black or white
I love you like I love the weather
