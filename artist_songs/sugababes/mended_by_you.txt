I tried to make it work
I learned the hardest way
I lost him in the end and it was over
I turned my back on love
I switched off at the mains
I cried night and day 'cos it was over

You came up I swear that it was just like something from a movie scene
When we met, we connected, I never expected
You'd be everything to me

[Chorus]
You are
Everything I wanna say
Nothing that I wanna lose
Feel like I will never break
I've been mended by you
You're the reason that I wanna stay
The places that I wanna go
'Cos I know, I've been mended by you

You never held me close
He never let me go
Just when I lost the fight, you were my soldier
And now we're standing here
In such a different place
August 23rd, do you remember?

You came up I swear that it was just like something from a movie scene
When we met, we connected, I never expected
You'd be everything to me

[Chorus]
You are
Everything I wanna say
Nothing that I wanna lose
Feel like I will never break
I've been mended by you
You're the reason that I wanna stay
The places that I wanna go
'Cos I know, I've been mended by you

I've been mended by you
I've been mended by you

[Chorus]
You are
Everything I wanna say
Nothing that I wanna lose
Feel like I will never break
I've been mended by you
You're the reason that I wanna stay
The places that I wanna go
'Cos I know, I've been mended by you

I've been mended by you
I've been mended by you
