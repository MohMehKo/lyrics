Call me honey
Sugar, babe, I'm what you want
I'm not asking no questions
Who you're coming from
Yeah, you're safe with me here
You speak
I become all tongue twisted
And I turn

Don't get too attached to me baby
Not right now
Don't wait up when your
Bored of throwing her around
Yeah, you're safe with me here
You speak
I become
Recipe to super fun

I'll give you something to think about
When you get home
A little something to trip about
Come on baby it's that time
Get my body in a recline
Watch that, let it go
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh

Let's figure out how to get this started
Once we get hooked up
Well you can party
I'm on a mission
So don't play shy
Hold my attention
Not like other guys
Looking to get what she don't wanna get
Like it's your birthday
It's what we'll get

You just hit, you hit this spot
I'm frustrated
Getting hot

How do you do it?
How do you sleep at night?
If she only knew it
You're dreaming of me at night
How do you do it?
Do it?

You speak I become
Automatically undone

I'll give you something to think about
When you get home
A little something to trip about
Come on baby it's that time
Get my body in a recline
Watch that, let it go
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh

When you get home
A little something to trip about
Come on baby it's that time
Get my body in a recline
Watch that, let it go
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Work it like you know it, boy
You got to get me through the day, oh boy
Work it like you know it, boy
You got to get me through the day, oh boy
Work it like you know it, boy
You got to get me through the day, oh boy
Work it like you know it, boy
You got to get me through the day, oh boy
