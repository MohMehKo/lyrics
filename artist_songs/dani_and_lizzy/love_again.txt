Don't associate me with the lover that you used to know
I don't have her bad behaviors or her crazy episodes
I can tell how she affects you, she's still creeping in your bones
You're so damaged like a battered man, let me hold you close

You won't open up to this
Cause I know you're hurt
You won't tell me what she did
But I know it burns
You gotta understand boy
I'm only here to treat you right
You gotta let me try

Let me show you how to love again, let me teach you how to trust my touch
Let me show you how to make amends, let me show you how to love again
Let me show you how to love again, let me teach you how to trust my touch
Let me show you how to make amends, let me show you how to love again

You act like you're not into it
Then you is, it's so unfair
Anytime that I get close, you act so tough like you don't care
Was she unfaithful tell me baby
Did she break your heart
I'm not her I'm so damn different
Can we take this from the start

You won't open up to this
Cause I know you're hurt
You won't tell me what she did
But I know it burns
You gotta understand boy
I'm only here to treat you right
You gotta let me try

Let me show you how to love again, let me teach you how to trust my touch
Let me show you how to make amends, let me show you how to love again
Let me show you how to love again, let me teach you how to trust my touch
Let me show you how to make amends, let me show you how to love again

You're fragile baby, that's ok, that's ok
You gotta let go put it, put it
All the way, all the way
You're agile lately... quick escape, quick escape
All it takes is one day; let me love you my way

Let me show you how to love again, let me teach you how to trust my touch
Let me show you how to make amends, let me show you how to love again
Let me show you how to love again, let me teach you how to trust my touch
Let me show you how to make amends, let me show you how to love again
