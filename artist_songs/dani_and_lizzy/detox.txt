Nobody told me it would be this hard
It would hurt this much, that it would break my heart into pieces
That I would struggle just to breathe
Nobody told me it would bring me to my knees

They say love takes time to heal and my heart will go on
But I don't think it ever will, like they say in the radio songs
I'm a junkie for your love, addicted to your touch
I'm tossin' and turnin', I'm sweatin' and burnin'
Like I'm coming off of drugs

[Chorus:]
The truth is I'm detoxin'
From your love, your love
And this ain't easy...
I'm detoxin' from your love, your love
And this ain't easy but it's gotta be done

Nobody told me I would crave you in my dreams
That you would linger in my head
And I would have to stay away
That it would eat me alive
Nobody told me a part of me would die

They say love takes time to heal and my heart will go on
But I don't think it ever will, like they say in the radio songs
I'm a junkie for your love, addicted to your touch
I'm tossin' and turnin', I'm sweatin' and burnin'
Like I'm coming off of drugs

[Chorus]
