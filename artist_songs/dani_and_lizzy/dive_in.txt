Who says that I should wait to make the first call
these silly rules, these silly games
They don't make sense at all
Some say I move a little fast, that I'm a little to quick to fall
But I believe that if you want it bad, then give it all the hope you have

Listen to your heart strings
The only song your heart sings

She says dive in, I dive in
Kissing at the speed of light
If you're in and I'm in, then why would we put up a fight?
If she says jump in, I'll jump in
Cuz my heart never lies if you're in and I'm in 
Then why would we ever hide, yeah yeah

Who says I can't express the feelings inside my soul
They say that fools rush in I think fools, they wait too long
And when you feel the fireworks, the fire burn and the feeling's so strong
That's the universe, that's cupid's work, guiding you along

Listen to your heart strings
The only song your heart sings

She says dive in, I dive in
Kissing at the speed of light
If you're in and I'm in, then why would we put up a fight?
If she says jump in, I'll jump in
Cuz my heart never lies if you're in and I'm in 
Then why would we ever hide, yeah yeah

She says dive in, I dive in
Kissing at the speed of light
If you're in and I'm in, then why would we put up a fight?
If she says jump in, I'll jump in
Cuz my heart never lies if you're in and I'm in 
Then why would we ever hide, yeah yeah
