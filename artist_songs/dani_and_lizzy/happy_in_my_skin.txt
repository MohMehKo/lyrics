I know I'm my own worst enemy
The way I put myself down
My words are venomous, they're killing me
Slowly they will break me down

I don't wanna beat myself up any more
That's how we let them win
I don't wanna hate myself like I did before
I wanna be happy in my skin..

[Chorus:]
So I say it feels so good to be me, I love the way I'm made
You'll no longer see me hiding in a masquerade
It feels so good to be me, just the way I'm made
You'll no longer see me hiding in a masquerade

I know I'm a prisoner of myself
I'm trapped inside a state of mind they made
All our lives we've been told to fix ourselves
We criticize and count the things we'd change

I don't wanna beat myself up any more
That's how we let them win
I don't wanna hate myself like I did before
I wanna be happy in my skin..

[Chorus]

One look in front of the mirror it took
Just one look and it was suddenly clear
Just one too many tears falling down my face
And one too many tears standing in my way
So much pressure to be better and enhance ourselves
I'm in a war every day against myself
So far, I let'em win
I couldn't help myself
But today I'm taking time to accept myself, you know
Our generation's insecure
We need more love
All of the world
Love who you are
I know, I know, sometimes it's hard
Our generation does deserve to be told we're beautiful
Because we are... All over the world

[Chorus]
