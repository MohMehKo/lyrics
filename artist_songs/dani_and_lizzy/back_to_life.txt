Some days I don't wanna wake up, I just wanna stay asleep
Cuz some days it feels like the weight of the world is falling on me
And I'm down and everyone else is up kicking around
And I can't keep the sick feeling that's bringing me down

But today I'm gonna crawl my way outta bed and face the day for you
If it takes all my strength and all my will I'mma do what I gotta do

So roll down the window, catch that wind
Feel the sunshine on your skin
We all have our little things that bring us back to life
And maybe it's love or something new
Like a brand new pair of dancing shoes
We all have our little things that bring us back to life
Today it's you yeah, today it's you yeah
Na na na na na

Sometimes I feel like I'm hanging by a thread
I'm hanging on for life, this pain is all too much
The loneliness, the lack of love
And I feel so alone, like the world don't know how I feel inside
I can't find the will or the energy to smile

But today I'm gonna crawl my way outta bed and face the day for you
If it takes all my strength and all my will I'mma do what I gotta do

So roll down the window, catch that wind
Feel the sunshine on your skin
We all have our little things that bring us back to life
And maybe it's love or something new
Like a brand new pair of dancing shoes
We all have our little things that bring us back to life
Today it's you yeah, today it's you yeah
Na na na na na

Roll down the window catch that wind
Feel the sunshine on your skin
We all have our little things that bring us back to life
Maybe it's love or something new
Like a brand new pair of dancing shoes
We all have our little things that bring us back to life

So roll down the window, catch that wind
Feel the sunshine on your skin
We all have our little things that bring us back to life
And maybe it's love or something new
Like a brand new pair of dancing shoes
We all have our little things that bring us back to life
Today it's you yeah, today it's you yeah
Na na na na na

Today it's you yeah, today it's you yeah
Na na na na na
