I wonder if you took me when you left
Did you wrap me in a memory with your souvenirs?
I wonder if you've thought about me since
I wonder if the memory is dear
I admit I have a few regrets
But I couldn't find the words when you were here

But now I can't stop thinkin' about you
Words pop in my head
Jot down a verse about you, wakes me out of bed
I play stop, press record and sing like I'm singin' for ya
Every word and every chord

You are my muse
The music and the sound
The lyrics I put down are all because of you
You are my muse
You inspire the melodies
Like a fire was lit in me
It's all because of you
And it sounds like la la la...

I wonder if you'll ever hear this song
Will you know that every word was really written by you
I wonder if you'll ever sing along
And maybe you'll be thinking bout me too

But now I can't stop thinkin' about you
Words pop in my head
Jot down a verse about you, wakes me out of bed
I play stop, press record and sing like I'm singin' for ya
Every word and every chord

You are my muse
The music and the sound
The lyrics I put down are all because of you
You are my muse
You inspire the melodies
Like a fire was lit in me
It's all because of you
And it sounds like la la la...

If I send a message in a bottle
Through the sound waves
Will you find it
Will you ever know it's the truth?
The song lives on
And has a life of it's own
Will you know that every word is about you

But now I can't stop thinkin' about you
Words pop in my head
Jot down a verse about you, wakes me out of bed
I play stop, press record and sing like I'm singin' for ya
Every word and every chord

You are my muse
The music and the sound
The lyrics I put down are all because of you
You are my muse
You inspire the melodies
Like a fire was lit in me
It's all because of you
And it sounds like la la la...
