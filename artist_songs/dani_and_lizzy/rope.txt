Baby, hold your breath don't speak for a minute
We in a bad place don't you get it
We can't afford to fight again, no
Baby, hold your tongue don't spit that venom
We on our way out, almost finished
We need to learn to be friends, yeah

Gotta think before we act
Laugh before we cry
Love before we hate
And you know why, yeah yeah

Cuz we're gripping on for life, holding on to hope
Every time we fight, it's like we sawing at a rope
Hanging on by a thread, thread is almost broke
Every time we fight, it's like we sawing at a rope
This is our last chance, so save your breath

Baby hold your temper, don't stress in the moment
Let it go, it's almost over
Just think soon we'll laugh again, yeah
I know that we're upset, but let's see the bigger picture
Please don't, we can't afford a mix up if we fight, this is the end

Gotta think before we act
Laugh before we cry
Love before we hate
And you know why, yeah yeah

Cuz we're gripping on for life, holding on to hope
Every time we fight, it's like we sawing at a rope
Hanging on by a thread, thread is almost broke
Every time we fight, it's like we sawing at a rope
This is our last chance, so save your breath

Yo, when we feel a fight creepin',
We got to take a notice and nip it to the bud before the both of us explode
And start saying things we can't take back that we throw out
Looking like a Black Friday but we can't afford a blow out
A balance of the pain, a balance of the pleasure
But if love is pain, then we shouldn't be together
We on our last legs gotta find the best in us
Cuz honestly we ain't got one fight left in us...

Cuz we're gripping on for life, holding on to hope
Every time we fight, it's like we sawing at a rope
Hanging on by a thread, thread is almost broke
Every time we fight, it's like we sawing at a rope
This is our last chance, so save your breath

Cuz we're gripping on for life, holding on to hope
Every time we fight, it's like we sawing at a rope
Hanging on by a thread, thread is almost broke
Every time we fight, it's like we sawing at a rope
This is our last chance, so save your breath
