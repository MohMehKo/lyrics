Fellas, so you want your love to last
Well don't you ever, don't you ever
Try to hold your baby back
You see there's really nothing to it
There's a simple way to do it
You can have her hand
If you love her and encourage her
The best way that you can

You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
How many times I've heard men say
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
Why their baby ran away

[Chorus:]
So if you wanna keep her, keep her love
I've got the recipe yeah
And if you wanna keep her, keep her love
It's as easy as 1, 2, 3
If you wanna keep her, keep her love
Listen to me… Women are free
You gotta let your, let your woman breathe

Fellas, so you want your love to last
Well just remember not to ever tell her that she can't
You see a woman needs to know that a man supports her goals
And has her back
You can't stop the wind… You don't stand a chance

You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
How many times I've heard a woman say
Oh he tells me that he loves me
But he don't do nothing but try to get in my way

[Chorus]

It's lovin' 101
If you really wanna keep someone
Don't you ever hold them back, baby
You know as well as I do that they'll just pack up and
Run, run, run
And when they run for the hills
You can kiss them good bye
You can try to clip my wings
And I'll just spread them and fly

[Chorus]
