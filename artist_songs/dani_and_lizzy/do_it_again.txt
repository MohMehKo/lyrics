You and I both we know that we're so impossible, whatever
I could count the obstacles but I would count forever and ever
We know inside our souls that we just want to be together forever
But we can't seem to find a way to make it through the weather together

And we fight and we cry and say goodbye
And we tell ourselves that this is the last time
Battling our hearts trying to stay away, whatever

Let's do it again, let's go through it again
Let's lie and lie and lie and lie to ourselves
Now doesn't that feel better? Knowing that it doesn't end right here
Let's lie and lie and lie and lie to ourselves
Now doesn't that feel better? Knowing that it doesn't end right here, yeah

You and I both know that we've tried
Like a million times, it's okay
Should'a count the reasons why we should try again babe
I know inside our hearts from the start
There's been a lot of pain, that's okay
But maybe we could make it work? Let's start today, wat'chu say?

And we fight and we cry and say goodbye
And we tell ourselves that this is the last time
Battling our hearts trying to stay away, whatever

Let's do it again, let's go through it again
Let's lie and lie and lie and lie to ourselves
Now doesn't that feel better? Knowing that it doesn't end right here
Let's lie and lie and lie and lie to ourselves
Now doesn't that feel better? Knowing that it doesn't end right here, yeah

Hey yo, it's hard to live without you
Even harder to livin' with ya
I paint a portrait of poetry
So you could get the picture
My confliction is that your love is highly addictive
But when there's jealousy, the fantasies seeming restricted
And you've always had me in the palms of your hand... grip
I break away and then I fall for you again... slip
And I'm just stuck in a cycle that I can't understand
This ain't the first time we've made some plans

Let's do it again, let's go through it again
Let's do it again, let's go through it again
Let's lie and lie and lie and lie to ourselves
Now doesn't that feel better? Knowing that it doesn't end right here
Let's lie and lie and lie and lie to ourselves
Now doesn't that feel better? Knowing that it doesn't end right here
