How did I lose myself to you and put you first?
I walked the universe for you and my feet hurt
How did I let you bring me down?
Down, down, down, down, down to the dirt
I was a fool to crawl for you and get nothing in return

That's ok, that's ok
I'm feeling better babe
Stronger than I've ever been
Back on my heels again
That's ok, that's ok
I learnt my lesson babe
I'm celebrating the return of my dignity

Bang, bang bang shots in the sky
I feel so alive just being free again
Bang, bang, bang free from the pain
Free from the stress that you've been bringing me
From the ground up baby I'm a whole new lady
With a whole new walk and a whole new talk
And it's not the same me
So bang, bang, bang, shots in the sky
I'm saying goodbye and hi to me again

I don't even know what I saw in ya
Every time we talk, I wish I never answered at all
But I did so the story unfolds
See we were never meant to be together forever
I used to act like I couldn't forecast the weather
Naive like I couldn't see the mask you under
Cause you acted like someone that you're actually not
But I can't hold back my thoughts
See I caught the games so I had to stop
It was a crash and burn but I learned a lot
Physical has never been a make it or break it
Man, I'm looking for a soul that matches mine, you ain't it
You never saw the light that give my life meaning
Don't care 'bout the things that give my life meaning

That's ok, that's ok
I'm feeling better babe
Stronger than I've ever been
Back on my heels again
That's ok, that's ok
I learnt my lesson babe
I'm celebrating the return of my dignity

Bang, bang bang shots in the sky
I feel so alive just being free again
Bang, bang, bang free from the pain
Free from the stress that you've been bringing me
From the ground up baby I'm a whole new lady
With a whole new walk and a whole new talk
And it's not the same me
So bang, bang, bang, shots in the sky
I'm saying goodbye and hi to me again

Your name is a whisper in the wind
Just an old flame baby
That burnt out with all your things
And your smile's a reminder of what I never wanna see again
So if you see me on the street baby, just keep on walking
Just keep on walking

Bang, bang bang shots in the sky
I feel so alive just being free again
Bang, bang, bang free from the pain
Free from the stress that you've been bringing me
From the ground up baby I'm a whole new lady
With a whole new walk and a whole new talk
And it's not the same me
So bang, bang, bang, shots in the sky
I'm saying goodbye and hi to me again
