You say this is love, but I say that it's sick
Something the doctor can't show up and fix
We've got problems, oh we've got problems
And you say that we're good but I know that we're not
Drowning myself in these bottles and shots
We've got problems, oh we've got problems

I have been listening to you for too long
You keep repeating and playing this song
Maybe you have me convinced that I am wrong

If love means I'll spend my nights alone
Try to keep from going home
Then you're right, you're right
I'm wrong, I'm wrong... I guess I'm in
Love means I'll spend my nights alone
Try to keep from going home
And you're right, you're right
I'm wrong, I'm wrong
I guess I'm in love, love...
I'm in love with you
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

You say this is love but I say that it's war
I put on my armor before I go home
We've got problems, oh we've got problems
And you say if I left then my love wasn't real
I say if you love me then let me just chill
From these problems, oh from these problems

I have been listening to you for too long
You keep repeating and playing this song
Maybe you have me convinced that I am wrong

If love means I'll spend my nights alone
Try to keep from going home
Then you're right, you're right
I'm wrong, I'm wrong... I guess I'm in
Love means I'll spend my nights alone
Try to keep from going home
And you're right, you're right
I'm wrong, I'm wrong
I guess I'm in love, love...
I'm in love with you
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

You use our fights as leverage to say that we got stronger
I see this as a clever twist to make me stick round longer man,
I see this so damn evident the way you flip our problems,
Make me feel like I've been walking with no effort forth to stop it
Man I've put my life on hold hours wasted with you talking
It's impossible
Like eating rice with fucking chop sticks
You feel better once you've lost it, I'm left with this exhaustion
You carry of your merry way, I carry that precaution
I mean you seem to like it how we argue bitch and fight
You say that love takes work, but there are workers rights
Man you couldn't use a knife for the tension you could slice,
You call this 'love' but I wouldn't call this 'like'

If love means I'll spend my nights alone
Try to keep from going home
Then you're right, you're right
I'm wrong, I'm wrong... I guess I'm in
Love means I'll spend my nights alone
Try to keep from going home
And you're right, you're right
I'm wrong, I'm wrong
I guess I'm in love, love...
I'm in love with you
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
