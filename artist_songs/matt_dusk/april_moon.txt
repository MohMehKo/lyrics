This is a story I've wanted to tell
I was left for some other guy
All I could do was wish them both well
And gaze at my friend in the sky

April Moon
You know me
I have wept here before
Can you believe I went back to her for more
I just hate that side of me

April Moon
My baby left me here with nothing
You know the ropes
Can't you do something
To restore my sanity

I remember the good times
Love was strong so I thought
Do the stars cheat on you
Like she did me
I think not
I think not

April Moon
So full, so bright
Maybe one day
She'll be in my arms again
But not tonight, not tonight
April Moon
