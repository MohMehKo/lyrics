Was it me? Was it you?
Was it all the little things that I didn’t do?
I’m tryin’ to move on, but I can’t
No, I can’t imagine being someone else’s man

[Chorus:]
I tried, I tried a million times to get you off my mind
It’s not that easy, it’s not that easy
Don’t you know how hard it is for me
To smile and say good-bye
It’s not that easy, it’s not that easy

It’s not over not for me
I used to have so much faith and I still believe
You’re my weakness, you’re my strength
And one without the other just don’t make much sense

[Repeat Chorus]

It’s not easy for me, as it is for you
Let’s talk about it, it’s not that easy

What am I meant to do without your love, your love?
What am I meant to do without your love?

What am I meant to do without your love, your love?
What am I meant to do without your love?

[Repeat Chorus]

Don’t you know how hard it is for me
To smile and say good-bye
It’s not that easy, it’s not that easy.
