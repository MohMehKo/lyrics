Life Goes On like a carousel, 
Life goes on a never-ending tale 
Of love reborn, from the cradle warm 
A web is spun for every mother's son 

Life goes on like a spinning wheel 
Life goes on never standing still 
The gods decide how blessed am I 
The days to come for every mother's son 

And these footprints in the sand maybe nothing grand 
But if we leave a mark in somebody's heart, what more can I say 
Than I was a king for a day 
Once the web is spun, for every mother's son 

Life goes on like a tapestry 
Life goes on each thread a part of me 
That master plan of who I am 
A day will come for every mother's son 

And these footprints in the sand maybe nothing grand 
But if we leave a mark in somebody's heart, what more can I say 
Than I was a king for a day 
Once the web is spun, for every mother's son 

A thorn a winter rose, some highs and then some lows 
That's the way it's spun, for every mother's son 
Every mother's son
