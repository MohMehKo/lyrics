You're cold as Ice, Dark as night, like a thorn left in my mind 
So why should I still long for you 
A mistress so impossible, so cruel yet wonderful 
Wise men have lost their wits over you 

You make me believe you're back for good each time 
Then you go and when you leave 
You take my pride but I need you still 
A man can need love but love never will 
You're cold as Ice, cold as ice 

And even when you're close to me, you're still a whisper of a dream 
What am I to hold on to. 
No loyalty in your design, so many lovers left behind 
But even though I see right through you 

You make me believe you're back for good each time 
Then you go and when you leave 
You take my pride but I need you still 
A man can need love but love never will 
You're cold as Ice, cold as ice 

You make me believe you're back for good each time 
Then you go and when you leave 
You take my pride but I need you still 
A man can feel love but love never will 
You're cold as Ice, but I love you 
And I always will 
... I guess I always 
You're cold as Ice, Dark as Night, Cold as Ice
