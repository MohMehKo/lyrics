When love is young 
The tallest tree 
Is there to climb 
Is evergreen
In summer fields we dream our dreams 
When love is young 

When love is young 
The air is sweet 
Forbidden fruit is all we eat 
An august moon is your conceit 
When love is young 

These are precious years 
Such intoxicating years 
When our innocence slowly comes undone 
Hearts are spilt on purest silk 
When love is young 

[INSTRUMENTAL]

These are precious years 
Such intoxicating years 
When our innocence slowly comes undone 
Hearts are spilt on purest silk 
When love is young 

When love is young 
The glass is full 
No empty chairs, no silent walls 
Like warriors, we conquer all 
When love is young 

These are precious years 
Such intoxicating years 
When our innocence slowly comes undone 
Hearts are spilt on purest silk 
These precious years 
These precious years 
Never will grow old 
They are forever gold
