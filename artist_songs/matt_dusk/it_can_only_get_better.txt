You let the sun refuse to shine
It won’t be long before the days are brighter
If every step’s an uphill climb
Carry on until they feel much lighter
For all the clouds up in the sky
For all the teardrops in the eyes

[Chorus:]
It can only get better
Be still my heart
It can only get better
We’ve come this far
It can only get better
I know it hurts
For what it’s worth
It can only get better

If they should ever come our way
Dry the tears and look somewhere above them
It’s easier to say than to do
But make believe that you no longer love them
When your back’s against the ropes
When you miss someone the most

[Repeat Chorus]

I know it hurts
For what it’s worth
It can only get better

I know it hurts
For what it’s worth
It can only get better
