Well... Remember when moses stopped to part the sea 
Walking on water down in galilee 
And the changing of water into wine, that no one else could do 
Well... My little miracle is you 

The mightest king with magic in his touch 
Everything turned to gold and such 
Well.. you must be the queen of alchemy, you change me through and through 
Well My little miracle is you 

Magical mystical, I wouldn't miss it all 
All of the things that you do 
I made a wish before, wished on that star before 
Someone to love me like you do 

I remember the bolt that came out of the blue 
And I remember the first time I laid eyes on you 
And the stars they dance inside my head, Baby that's when I knew 
My little miracle is you 

Magical mystical, I wouldn't chage it all 
All of the things that you do 
I made a wish before, wished on that star before 
Someone to love me like you do 

I remember the bolt that came out of the blue 
And I remember the first time I laid eyes on you 
And the stars they dance inside my head, Baby that's when I knew 
My little miracle is you
