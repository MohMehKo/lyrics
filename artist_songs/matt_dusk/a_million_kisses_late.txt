Didn’t know how much I loved her
I’ll never know what might have been
I’d give anything to hold her
and have her back again.

I never should'a let her go
so many things I should'a let her know
should'a held her in my arms said "baby no, please wait"
I woke up to find, she had changed her mind
I’d run out of time, 'bout a million kisses late.

No I’m no good without her
and I feel lost out on the streets
ask all out friends about her
and the news is bittersweet.

I never should'a let her go
so many things I should'a let her know
should'a held her in my arms said "baby no, please wait"
I woke up to find, she had changed her mind
I’d run out of time, 'bout a million kisses late.

I let her walk away; I lost it all that day
don't make the same mistake

I never should'a let her go
so many things I should'a let her know
should'a held her in my arms said "baby no, please wait"
I woke up to find, she had changed her mind
I’d run out of time, 'bout a million kisses too late.
