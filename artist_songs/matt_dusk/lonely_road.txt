I sit and stare, and empty chair, another day without you 
Each one for me, can only be, another day without you 
The tick and tock of every clock seems so long 
No good and bad when all you have is gone 

I put the street beneath my feet, so not to think about you 
But every sound and every sight unlocks a picture of you 
Each memory a rush of joy and pain 
If only I could hold you once again! 

This is the lonely road 
This is the lonely road 
No signs to lead you home 
There's no lights to tell you not go 
And nowhere is the only place that it goes 
The only place that everybody knows 
The Lonely road. 

And if we laughed and if we cried we did it all together 
It never once crossed my mind it wouldn't last forever 
One mistake, that's all it takes and then 
You turn around, you're on your own again 

This is the lonely road 
This is the lonely road 
No signs to lead you home 
There's no lights to tell you not go 
And nowhere is the only place that it goes 
The only place that everybody knows 
The Lonely road.

One mistake, that's all it takes and then 
You turn around, youre on your own again 

This is the lonely road 
This is the lonely road 
No signs to lead you home 
There's no lights to tell you not go 
And nowhere is the only place that it goes 
The only place that everybody knows 
The Lonely Road
