Out of the tree of life, I picked me a plum
You came along and everything started to hum
Still it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come

The best is yet to come, won't that be fine
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine

Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
Wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet

The best is yet to come, won't that be just fine
The best is yet to come, come the day that your mine

Come the day your mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain that cup dry

Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here

The best is yet to come, won't that be so fine
The best is yet to come, come the day that your mine
Come the day that your mine, mmm mmm mine.
