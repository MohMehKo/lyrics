More than the greatest love the world has known
This is the love I give to you alone
More than the simple words I try to say
I only live to love you more each day

More than you’ll ever know my arms long to hold you so
My life will be in your keeping, waiting, sleeping, laughing, weeping

Longer than always is a long, long time
But far beyond forever you’ll be mine
I know I never lived before
And my heart is very sure
No one else could love you more

More than you’ll ever know my arms long to hold you so
My life will be in your keeping, waiting, sleeping, laughing, weeping

Longer than always is a long, long time
But far beyond forever you’ll be mine
I know I've never lived before
And my heart is very sure
No one else could love you more
No one else could love you more
Love you more.
