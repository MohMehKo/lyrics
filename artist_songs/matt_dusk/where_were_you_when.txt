Where were you when, my first love came callin'
my heart kept on fallin' like a stone?
Where were you when, I left home for college
traded that first love for knowledge?

I’ve lived in the dark, I’ve refused to forgive
but somehow I knew, there was more I could give.

Long before you came to me, I laid beneath the evergreens
dreamed this day would come, if only I had known
far beyond the eye could see, my soul knew what was best for me
I only had to wait, and for that I have faith, in love.

Who held your hand, on your first day to school?
Who read to you that night?
Who broke your heart for the first time?
Did you cry out loud just to know why?

Have you lived in the dark or refused to forgive
but somehow just knew there was more you could give.

Long before you came to me, I laid beneath the evergreens
dreamed this day would come, if only I had known
far beyond the eye could see, my soul knew what was best for me
I only had to wait, and for that I have faith, in love
long before you came to me, I laid beneath the evergreens
dreamed this day would come, if only I had known
far beyond the eye could see, my soul knew what was best for me
I only had to wait, and for that I have faith

Long before you said to me, you saved my heart and rescued me
I walked this lonely mile, and now I hold a smile
Far beyond the mission bells, long before our fare-thee-well
my dream of finding you, has finally, come true.
