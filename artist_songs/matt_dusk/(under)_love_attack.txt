Once upon time I was so strong
I resisted every small advance
No chance of my surrender
You couldn’t find a way to force me to give in

And you wait just like fate
Or that perfect moment
To unleash your charm
(girl you got me good)
(girl you got me good)
I tried to run, but you won
You’ve got a lock onto me
I can’t breathe

[Chorus:]
Like a drug you take me higher
Intoxicate me with desire
No escape of sign of cover
Something tells me that I gotta watch my back
I think I’m under love attack!

You knew how to weaken my defenses
I could not see your true intentions
You hid you tricks of alchemy
And you made the perfect poison
That brings me to my knees

And you wait just like fate
Or that perfect moment
To unleash your charm
(girl you got me good)
(girl you got me good)
I tried to run, but you won
You’ve got a lock onto me
I can’t breathe

[Repeat Chorus]

I can’t breathe, all the pressure’s ‘round me
I can’t see, I never saw this coming
And I feel the temperature is rising
I’m overheated….love attack

[Repeat Chorus twice]
