He plays the game 
Like a moth that finds love in a flame 
He's flying high 
But desire will burn him alive 

This is the price you pay 
When you're heart is fooling your eyes 

She plays the game 
where the hunter turns into the prey 
He wants her still 
But the black widow's beauty will kill 

Caught in the tender trap 
Where the story of heartache begins 

What makes that man gamble all on love 
He's played but never won 
The roulet he knows is of the Russian kind 
Watch out... 'cause love's a loaded gun 

They play the game 
Win or lose they're damned either way 
He ends up alone 
Cause medusa turns hearts into stone 

She knows theres no way out 
But made him believe he could win 

What makes that man gamble all on love 
He's played but never won 
The roulette he knows is of the Russian kind 
Watch out... 'cause love's a loaded gun 

What makes that man gamble all on love 
He's played but never won 
The roulette he knows is of the Russian kind 
Watch out... 'cause love's a loaded gun
