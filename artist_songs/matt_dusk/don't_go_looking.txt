Cry sad tears, then dry your eyes and mend your heart 
Life's too short to waste sweet time, love is gone now you must start
Deep blue eyes smile at you across the room 
You say that his brown, and he is not the guy that you once knew 

Don't go looking for, that heart you loved before 
You cant replace him with the same kind of face 
Don't dream that sweet old dream. Its not the final scene 
Be open to somebody else, someone new. 

Change brings fear as clouds will always bring the rain, 
But when it finally clears their sun will shine to make it bright again 
Let love in, you might feel it deeper still, 
But if you hide away, I swear you never will 

Don't go looking for, that heart you loved before 
You cant replace him with the same kind of face 
Don't dream that sweet old dream. Its not the final scene 
Be open to somebody else, someone new. 

Don't go looking for, that heart you loved before 
Be open to somebody else, someone new.
