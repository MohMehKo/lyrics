Here I go once again
Will I find the same end, or will I get it right
Will I change?
Will I make all the same mistakes?
O will I see the light?

Your friends said that we
Would never last that long
Well I guess your friends were wrong

[Chorus:]
We’ll still love kissin’, we’ll still refuse to listen
This got to be the world’s longest fling
We’re still hangin’ in there
So very glad we’ve been there
Even if I could
I wouldn’t change a thing

Maybe we’ll have a fight
That’ll mess up the whole night
It can even last for days
But they’re few and they’re far
In between the next star
Making up is always great
Yes it’s true on paper
We don’t look that strong
Well I guess the paper’s wrong

[Repeat Chorus]

[Ext Chorus:]
Even when you steal the covers
I wouldn’t change a thing
Even when I’m at your mothers
I wouldn’t change a thing
Even when you take me shopping
I wouldn’t change a thing
Even when you won’t stop talking

On a side note when I first met you
I never thought I’d get to share every single thing with you
And now you make me feel brand new

[Repeat Chorus twice]

[Repeat Ext Chorus]

Even if I could, I wouldn’t change a thing
