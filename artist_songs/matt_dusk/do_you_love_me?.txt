Truth be told simple and bold I think you’re special
We can roll like a team, know what I mean
See, I’m not gonna mess around
And I’m not gonna let you down
Cause I do love you
This I know, this I know!

[Chorus:]
Money makes the world go round
People will be people always
Baby what goes up comes down
This I know, so here I go

Do you love me? (love me)
Do you love me? (love me)
Do you love me? Tell me!

Hot or miss, here’s what it is you are that someone
A diamond in the rough, the real stuff!
Now if a good girl is hard to find
Then luck is a friend of mine, cause I do love you
This I know, this I know

[Repeat Chorus]

You’re the one I’ve been looking for
My eyes have no need to wander anymore
I don’t need anyone I got you
This I know, this I know

[Repeat Chorus]
