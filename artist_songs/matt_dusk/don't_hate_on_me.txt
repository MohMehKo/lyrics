I try to search but it’s hard to find
A reason leave it all behind
I made a promise that I wanna keep
To spend my days with you

You’re the light when I’m feeling dark
You’re the stranger that confuses my heart
One step forward and two steps back
We’re the right train running on the wrong track
We’re the right train running on the wrong track
But it takes two

[Chorus:]
So this is for you this is for me
This is for love that now is history
Don’t blame it on you, don’t blame it on me
Blame it on the trip, had no guarantee
This is the day, this is the time
Don’t hate on me

I try to reach but it’s way too high
High up in the sky where I can’t fly
I like you gone but I wonder why
Why I’m missing you?

You’re the sun when I’m feeling the rain
You’re the needle when I don’t pain
One step forward and two steps back
We’re the right train running on the wrong track
We’re the right train running on the wrong track
Cause it takes two

[Repeat Chorus]

We gave it a try, we gave it our all
There’s no need to cry 'cause sometime you fall
We’re the right train running on the wrong track
We’re the right train running on the wrong track

[Repeat Chorus twice]
