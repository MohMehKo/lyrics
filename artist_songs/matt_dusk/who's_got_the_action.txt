A gal is like a racehorse, I play her to win
but if I should lose her, another may come in
love can be like heaven, love can be a joke
but it's worth a gamble, so hey I go for broke.

Who's got the action?
Who'll take a chance on love?
Who's got a kiss for me?
Give me one and you'll get back three
Who's got the action?
Just lay it on the line
I’ll bet you 10 to 1 you'll be mine.

Now once I had a Philly, I ain't seen her since
Some can't go the distance; they're only good in sprints
Sweethearts stay together, when it's fair and warm
but comes stormy weather, they don't run to form.

Who's got the action?
Who'll take a chance on love?
Who's got a kiss for me?
Give me one and you'll get back three
Who's got the action?
Just lay it on the line
I’ll bet you 10 to 1 you'll be mine.

They put on a long shot, I play either way
All I need's a winner, and this could be the day
When I win my parlay, I’ll be set for life
I’ll take all that money, and go find me a wife.

Who's got the action?
Who'll take a chance on love?
Who's got a kiss for me?
Give me one and you'll get back three
Who's got the action?
Just lay it on the line
I’ll bet you 10 to 1, I’ll bet you 10 to 1
I’ll bet you 10 to 1 you'll be mine.
