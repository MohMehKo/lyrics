I’m here, it’s clear
I’m in the moment
Back with a better view
Not a clue where I’m going
But going all out for you
Tomorrow’s not promised
What the wise man used to say
So let’s seize each day

No ties, we’re just happy-go-lucky
Don’t you blow the surprise
So nice like I told
When I hold you

[Chorus:]
It’s like falling in love for the first time
It’s like waking up fresh in the sunshine
Like having nothing to lose
Baby you’re good news, you’re good news
It’s like dancing all night ‘til the light’s gone
It’s like singing along to your favorite song
It never gets old with you
Baby you’re good news, you’re good news

You can come as you like
As you want to
Love’s a revolving door
Let it spin let me want you
I want you to come back for more
Now easily we could be madly in lust for life
But baby why ask why

No ties, we’re just happy-go-lucky
Don’t you blow the surprise
So nice like I told
When I hold you

[Repeat Chorus]

Now if you love something you’ve got to let it go
If it comes back it’s yours, and it means that much more

[Repeat Chorus twice]
