Just Five minutes to your house 
It took five hours to say goodbye 
Five weeks to wonder why
And five months of just rain 

I had a path 
That led me home 
It gathered no moss 
But now I'm alone 

There was five minutes without air 
Five hours without meaning 
Five weeks without insight 
And Five months 'till I sing 

No simple words 
No warning signs 
To pause for justice 
No peace for a while 

Its been a year 
I see that you've called 
I've braved my first winter 
This chapter is closed 

I'm gonna fly 
Out of this town 
I'll love again in time 
And fall like a stone
