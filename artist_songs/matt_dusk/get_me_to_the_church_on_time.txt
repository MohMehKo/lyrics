A few more hours, that's all the time I got
A few more hours, before I tie the knot
There'll be drinks and girls all over the town
and I gotta track'em down
in just a few more hours.

I'm gettin' married in the morning
Ding-dong the bells are gonna chime
Pull out the stopper, we'll have a whopper
But get me to the church on time.

I got to get there in the morning
Spruced up and lookin' in my prime
girls come and kiss me, say that you'll miss me
but get me to the church on time.

If I am dancing roll up the floor
If I am whistling, right out the door
I got to get there in the morning
Ding-ding-dong they're gonna chime
Kick up a rumpus, don't lose your compass
Get me to the church, Get me to the church
Pete's sake get me to the church on time.

if I’m flyin', then shoot me down
if I’m wooin', get the girl right out of town
I got to get there in the morning
ding-ding-dong they're gonna chime
punch me and jail me, stamp me and mail me
Get me to the church, Get me to the church
Pete's sake get me to the church on time
on time, on time, on time.
