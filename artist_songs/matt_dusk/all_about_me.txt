What a fine mess I got myself into this time
Who'd have thought a guy like me would crumble?
I'm sure that not a soul would ever guess that
I'm finding it hard to even stumble

I used to think that I was strong
I used to think the world revolved around me
Never thought that I was wrong
And this big foot doll almost drowned me

But I'm breaking out of my routine
And about time that I come clean
And it's all good and it's all new
Let's re-introduce myself to you

No trouble that I'm in
There's no way that I can't win
And a good man I will be
Once I learn it's not all about me

There was a day when the walls were covered with my face
Walking through, you'd think it was my mother's
There was not a single hair out of place
One eyebrow just a little bit higher than the other

I used to think that I was cool
I used to think the world was for the taking
Going to a brand new school
Look at all the friends I'm making

'Cuz I'm breaking out of my routine
And about time that I come clean
And it's all good and it's all new
Let's re-introduce myself to you

No trouble that I'm in
There's no way that I can't win
And a good man I will be
Once I learn it's not all about me

Myself and I, yes, we made a deal
To become a better man
So throw away the books
And just do it by feel

'Cuz I'm breaking out of my routine
And about time that I come clean
And it's all good and it's all new
Let's re-introduce myself to you

No trouble that I'm in
There's no way that I can't win
And a good man I will be
Once I learn it's not all about me

Breaking out of my routine
And about time that I come clean
And it's all good and it's all new
Let's re-introduce myself to you

No trouble that I'm in
There's no way that I can't win
And a good man I will be
Once I learn it's not all about me
