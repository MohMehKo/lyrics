I don’t know why I’m calling
I don’t know if I should
I know you’re not a doctor
But you could do me some good

Operator please
I need your sympathy
So talk to me

The ship I’m on is sinking
And I never learned to swim
I need someone to save me
Throw me a line
And pull me in

Operator please
Won’t you rescue me
I need your company

[Chorus:]
So tell me, tell me
You will be the one who hears my lonely voice tonight
If someone calls me all they’ll get is a busy line
‘Till we say bye tell me that you will be mine mine mine
I’ll make believe that you like me too
I’m hung up on you

Here is my confession
Not acting like I should
I think I’ve learned my lesson
And I feel misunderstood

Operator please
I need you to comfort me
I’m down on my knees

I used to be so shady
I did some dirty deeds
I wasn’t always faithful
I said, “A man has got his needs.”

Operator please
Don’t leave me in the cold and put my soul on hold

[Repeat Chorus]

When this call is over
I’ll be running through your mind
You might think I’m crazy
But you’ll want me to ring another time
And I know, and you know
You’ll call me down the line
Hung up on you, don’t know what to do
I’m hung up on you

[Repeat Chorus]
