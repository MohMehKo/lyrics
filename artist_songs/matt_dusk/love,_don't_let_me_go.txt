Love, don’t you let me go
When I need you so
Don’t you let me go

You keep my dreams alive
How would I survive
Without you in my life?

Loneliness would take your place
The moment that you’re gone
It would be so hard to carry on

Love, leave me in the dark
And I will fall apart
It would break my heart

I don’t need to hear your voice
To know when you’re around
In this hour of darkness
I am looking to be found
I can only hope that you
Won’t let me down

Love, love don’t you let me go
When I need you so
Love, don’t you let me go
