Snow is falling
Friends are calling
The lights are all aglow
Sleigh bells are ringing
Choirs are singing
Candy canes and mistletoe

Itâ€™s a time full of laughter
So grab yourself a cup of cheer
Stop your shopping and hang your stocking
Cause Santa and his sleigh are near

Candles gleaming
Children dreaming
Toys wrapped under the tree
Reindeer in the sky
Snowballs on the fly
Cookies by the chimney

Gather friends and family
Just take the time to stop
And share good memories
They will find you
Cause Christmas is finally here

If Jack Frost is willing
The air will be a-chilling
Rooftop icicles form
Fires are burning
Lovers they are yearning
Folks wrapped up nice and warm

Gather friends and family
Just take the time to stop
And share good memories
They will find you
Cause Christmas is finally here
