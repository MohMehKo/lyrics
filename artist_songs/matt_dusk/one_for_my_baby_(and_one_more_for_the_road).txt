It's quarter to three,
There's no one in the place 'cept you and me
So set 'em' up Joe
I got a little story you oughtta know

We're drinking my friend
To the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

I got the routine
Put another nickel in the machine
I'm feeling so bad
Can’t you make the music easy and sad

I could tell you a lot
But you gotta to be true to your code
So make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

You'd never know it
But buddy I'm a kind of poet
I've got a lot of things I’d like to say
And if I'm gloomy, won’t you listen to me
Till it's all, all talked away

Well, that's how it goes
And Joe I know you're gettin' you wanna go home
Thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind
My bending your ear

But this torch that I found
It's gotta be drowned
Or it soon might explode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
For the road
That road.
