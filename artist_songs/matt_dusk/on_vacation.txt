You think I’m sad, think I’m blue
Now that I’m no longer with you
I’m on vacation far away
And nothing you could say could ever change my mind

[Chorus:]
Everything is good now that you are gone
I am dancin’ with my records on
I don’t cry about you anymore
I’m so much better than I was before
Everything is cool, everything is fine
I am smilin’ now all the time
I’ve got no worries anymore
And if you don’t believe it, believe it

I’m at the beach, sand on my feet
Checking out all the girls I can meet
I’m on vacation far away
And nothing you could say could ever change my mind

[Repeat Chorus]

I’m feeling good
Now that you’re gone
I’m dancin’ with my records on
I’m cool
I’m fine
I’m smilin’
All the time
All the time
All the time
Yeah, yeah all the time

[Repeat Chorus]
