Besame besame mucho,
Each time I cling to your kiss
I hear music divine
Besame, besame mucho
Hold me my darling
Say that you'll always be mine

Oh this joy is something new
My arms enfolding you
I never knew this thrill before
Who ever thought I'd be
Holding you close to me
Whispering it's you I adore

So dearest one, if you should leave me
Then each little dream would take wing
And my life would be through.
Besame, besame mucho
Love me forever
Make all my dreams come true

Oh this joy is something new,
My arms enfolding you,
I never knew this thrill before
Who ever thought I'd be
Holding you close to me
Saying it's you I adore

So dearest one, if you should leave me
Each little dream wouldl take wing
And my life would be through.
So besame, besame mucho
Love me forever
Make all my dreams come true
