I cannot speak, I can barely hear you 
My world spins around in silent slow mode 
Could you please repeat these words I swear you now seem to utter so softly to me 
Confusion stares blankly as you ask if I do 
Your frustration's confirmation that you said I love you 

[Chorus]
Please forgive me I was just catching my breath 
Blown away by every part of life making sense 
Shaken by the dream that we're sleeping the four letter word that is all, hopelessly gone,
I fall 

This coffee's still hot, but time is frozen 
I'd say makes you, but that's unspoken 
I wish that this shot could be replaced 
Whenever we lose sight of all that we've got 
Illusion is now real but the shock is still here 
I do my best to keep control and fight back ten million tears 

[Chorus]

Fall into your arms, so scared (so please don't hurt me) 
Know that my heart will stay here (and is safe with you) 
I can't say all that I feel, so take this kiss for all the words I mean to offer you 

Please forgive me I was catching my breath 
Confusion stares blankly as you ask if I do 

Awoken by the dream that we're sleeping 
The four letter word that is all 
Hopelessly gone 
I fall
