I keep dreaming that I'm falling
There's no safety net
You look up with arms wide open
Then you smile and walk away
I guess that Freud would have an answer
He'd say that I was twisted and 
Confused and just insane
Couldn't blame him!
I feel like lately all the things I took for granted 
Flipped and changed
Now I'm losing grip again...

Oh Oh
I'm walking a tightrope
Between who I love and what I know
Oh Oh
I'm watching the sharks lick their lips
As they circle far below...

I'd slip my skin and lose this face
If we could find a secret place to hide
Say the words I need to hear and 
I would leave it all behind
My psychic says she sees disaster
My heart is begging that I take a giant leap of faith
See are you really worth the risk 
Of losing everything I have
For what might be one stupid kiss?

Oh Oh
I'm walking a tightrope
Between who I love and what I know
Oh Oh
I'm watching the sharks lick their lips
As they circle far below...

I don't know why it is that you won't say you love me
I don't know what it is

I keep slipping back to you
When you're not good for me
I keep wanting what I can't have
Mr. Freud would you disagree?

Oh Oh
I'm walking a tightrope
Between who I love and what I know
Oh Oh
I'm watching the sharks lick their lips
As they circle far below...

I don't know why it is that you won't say you love me
I don't know what it is but this tightrope's got me
