Wishin', and hopin', and thinkin', and prayin'
Planning and dreamin' each night of his charms
That won't get you into his arms
So if your're looking to find love you can share
All you gotta do is hold him and kiss him and love him
And show him that you care

Show him that you care just for him
Do the things that he likes to do.
Wear your hair just for him
'Cause you won't get him, thinkin' and a-prayin',
Wishin' and hopin'

Just wishin', and hopin', and thinkin', and prayin'
Planning and dreamin' his kisses will start
That won't get you into his heart!
So if you're thinking how great true love is
All you gotta to is
Hold him, and kiss him and squeeze him and love him
Just do it and after you do
You will be his

Show him that you care just for him
Do the things that he likes to do
Wear your hair just for him
'Cause you won't get him, thinkin' and a-prayin',
Wishin' and hopin'

Just wishin' and hopin' and thinkin' and prayin'
Planning and dreamin'
His kisses will start
That won't get you into his heart
So if you're thinking how great true love is
All you gotta to is
Hold him, and kiss him, and squeeze him and love him
Just do it and after you do
You will be his

You will be his.
