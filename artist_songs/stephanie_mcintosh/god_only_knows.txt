How I'll wake in the morning,
How I won't see the space the gaping hole here in my bed
How I'll make my cup of coffee,
How I'll walk to the subway and not miss you hold my hand.

[Chorus:]
God only knows
I fall in, I freak out
Too deep I cannot climb out
You told me you loved me, I thought that meant you loved me
My stupid heart breaks
When will I ever learn to let go
God only knows

God only knows

How I'll wander the sidewalk
How I'll make it to work on time now that you're gone
When I can't make my car start
When I can't pay the rent up
How will I go on?

[Chorus]

Standing in the pouring rain, I'm fighting back the tears again
I thought the love would last forever
Please, I can't seem to:..Breathe.
I fall in, I freak out
Yeah

I fall in, I freak out
Too deep I cannot climb out
You told me you loved me, I thought that meant you loved me
When will I ever learn to let go
God only knows
God only knows
Yeah
