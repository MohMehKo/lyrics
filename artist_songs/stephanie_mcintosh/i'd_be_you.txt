Coffee lights my emptiness
It's self-inflicted pain I guess
In this room my dreams are dreamt
I can't remember where they went

In a magazine up on a rack
Is where I'd live in white and black
If I could walk these streets unseen
If I could have one little thing 
I'd be you
I'd be you

Confiscate my liberty
I'm not worth a damn to me
I want to have my name in lights
I want to party through the night like you

In a penthouse suite of a grand hotel
With jacuzzis, champagne and waiter bells
Camera men and limousines
If I could have one little thing
I'd be you
I'd be you

If I was you
If you were me
If I was you
I'd be happy

Cigarettes and irony
I want to be a star
Loneliness won't validate
I can't take it anymore
If I could have one little thing
I'd switch my life with yours
If I could roll the dice again
I'd change the way they fall
I'd be you
I'd be you
