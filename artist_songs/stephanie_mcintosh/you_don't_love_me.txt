I see the blue in your eyes
Baby what are you hiding?
I catch a glimspe of the truth
And it don't look good, no
I feel the ground fall away

As you fight back the tears
And choke the words

[CHORUS]
You don't love me
You can't say it
After all this time
You don't want me
You can't mean it
Tell me your lied
Yesterday everything
Seemed so ok
How can it be that today
You don't love me?

I thought that I really knew
Who you were, baby
But now my world is a mess
And I'm going down
I can't bear to believe

There's nobody else
The reason is...

[CHORUS]

You've shattered my heart
And you've left it for dead
The truth is I've been misled
You don't love me

How could we get so close
And end up as strangers?
How could something so good end up like this?

[CHORUS]

You've shattered my heart
And you've left it for dead
The truth is I've been misled
You don't love me
