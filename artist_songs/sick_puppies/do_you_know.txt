I wish I could see what's outside
And be to places I've never seen before
A place where time doesn't take as long to pass
And no-one has to lie
Everything is simple as it seems
And there is no painful way to die
To DIE...

Do you know how it feels Inside
To know that every day in every way
You're losing your mind

Don't tell me what I know
Because you're the one that I'm gonna show
A place where time doesn't take as long to pass
And no-one has to lie
Everything is simple as it seems
There is no painful way to die
to DIE...

Do you know how it feels Inside
To know that every day in every way
You're losing your mind

Do you know how it feels Inside
To know that every day in every way
You're losing your mind
