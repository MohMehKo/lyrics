Every time I end up breaking you
You change into
Something worth keeping
Every time I'm close to saving you
You grow into
A sin worth believing
You're everything I ever wanted but
It's never enough
You're never enough

I'll take whatever I can take
Whenever I can take it
If it ever comes

I hate you when you're gone
I hate you turn me on
I hate the way I need you when
I don't know where you are
I love it even more
When I find you on the floor
I know you think you hate me
But I will always hate you more

I never knew until I got a taste
What a waste
For what I had been through
'Cause nothing ever really makes that change
I'm so ashamed
Of what I did to you
I had to let you in to feel that rush
You were too much
Way too much

I'll take whatever I can take
Whenever I can take it
If it ever comes

I hate you when you're gone
I hate you turn me on
I hate the way I need you when
I don't know where you are
I love it even more
When I find you on the floor
I know you think you hate me
But I will always hate you more

Round and round and...

I never knew until I got a taste
I'm so ashamed
Of what I did to you

I hate you when you're gone
I hate you turn me on
I hate the way I need you when
I don't know where you are
I love it even more
When I find you on the floor
I know you think you hate me
But I will always hate you more

I hate you when you're gone
I hate you turn me on
I hate the way I need you when
I don't know where you are
I love it even more
When I find you on the floor
I know you think you hate me
But I will always hate you more
