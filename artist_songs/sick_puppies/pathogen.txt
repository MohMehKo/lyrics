I've got a sickness I can't hide
Personal pathogen inside
I've got a reputation, you've got a vaccination
You'll take this bitter pill in time

It's been so long, we've carried on
Through the hardest times, we survived
Am I lost? Cause I still feel like I'm losing my mind

We took the road to nowhere, and when we finally got there
We found a million more like us
Take back these wasted choices, get back to our own voices
Then we can feel, but I don't mind

It's been so long, we've carried on
Through the hardest times, we survived
Am I lost? Cause I still feel like I'm losing my mind

Still feel like I'm losing my mind

Its been so long, we've carried on
Through the hardest times, we survived
Am I lost? Cause I still feel like I'm losing my mind
(Losing my mind)
Losing my mind
(Losing my mind)
Losing my mind
(Losing my mind)
Losing my mind
(Losing my mind)
Cause I still feel like I'm losing my mind
