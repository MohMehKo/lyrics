I'm holding onto white balloons
Up against a sky of doom
Tell me you see them
'Cause what's inside of me is invisible to most
Even in clear view
I'm sending out a signal to the possibility of you
'Cause right at this moment
I know you're connected to a part of me that I don't even know myself

The changes in me
Are likely to be like the weather
Stormy and clear strength into fear bound together

But I'll break my silence
If I believed that you and me could ever be
More than just what's been behind us
I tried and left, they came and went
I got rejected out again
But no one believes me
I've worn a hundred faces
Of the character replacements and now
Nobody sees me

The changes in me
Are likely to be like the weather
Cloudy at best...

Angels lift me
Are you with me?
I'm holding onto you like 
I'm holding onto white balloons
Carry me away
I hope that you don't break
Angels lift me
Are you with me?
I'm holding onto you like 
I'm holding onto white balloons
Carry me away
I hope that you don't break
I hope that you don't break
Don't break

'Cause what's inside of me is invisible to most
Even in clear view
