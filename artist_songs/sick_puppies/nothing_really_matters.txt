Does it matter in the scheme of things
While there are killers on the street and people going through bins
We got lawyers and pimps all with five faces
Setting up shop in all the same places
I say hello and you say goodbye i put out my hand and your spit in my eye

The trap is set for anyone whose ever thought 
But deep down below everybody knows theres a price and everything can be bought
Not much left to live for theres not much left to be
Nothing really matters
Really matters to me

This is how they think this is how they feel
This is their idea of people keeping it real
They're supposed to be working but there so fucking slack
Taking one step forward and two steps back
Now with a slap on the back in the sack for a shack and then everybodys happy today
I don't know what i've been told what do you say

I wanna go home    [x8]

The trap is set for anyone whose ever thought 
But deep down below everybody knows theres a price and everything can be bought
