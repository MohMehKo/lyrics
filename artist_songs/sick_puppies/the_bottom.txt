If you wanna sink to the bottom with me
Come get gotten, reelin' and rotten beneath
1, 2, 3 and down you go
You'll be smilin' before you know
If you wanna sink to the bottom with me

[Chorus]
We're all rotten, buried and forgotten
Livin' it up underground
So take a ride
HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY!
You really can't be lookin' so surprised
If you can't beat them, might as well eat them
No one's gettin' out alive
Give it a try
HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY!
It really is a wicked way to die

Listen my friend to the sound of a sweet melody
Doesn't it seem to resound like an old memory?
Screamin' and cryin' we'll have none of that
Yoy had your chance now just sit and relax
Don't you wanna sink to the bottom with me?

[Chorus]
We're all rotten, buried and forgotten
Living it up underground
So take a ride
HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY!
You really can't be looking so surprised
If you can't beat them, might as well eat them
No one's gettin' out alive
Give it a try
HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY!
It really is a wicked way to die

You'll get used to it in a while
Look at the way each of us smile
You were livin' a fantasy
This is exactly what you need

Don't you wanna sink to the bottom with me?
You're getting real gotten, reelin' and rotten beneath
1, 2, 3 and down you go
Feel that smile just start to grow
If you wanna sink to the bottom

[Chorus]
We're all rotten, buried and forgotten
Living it up underground
So take a ride
HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY!
You really can't be looking so surprised
If you can't beat them, might as well eat them
No one's gettin' out alive
So give it a try, try, try, try
It really is a wicked way, it really is a wicked way,
It really is a wicked way to die

They're all just so pathetic
It's all psychosomatic
The more they think the more we know
So welcome home
