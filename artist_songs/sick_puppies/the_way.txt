I came home to a house without you
The air was stale, the walls were bare
But somehow I still knew, that you were there

I wanna see you more
I miss your company
I wish that things were still
The way they used to be

The phone call at 3am
To come and pick me up
Was i born to be a ballet dancer, or an astronaut
If I needed to talk, you would make the time for me
I wish that things were still
The way they used to be

But only for a day
Just so I can say
That I remembered you
Because I wouldn't be the same
If anything was changed
And thats the truth

I wanna see you more
I miss your company
I wish that things were still
The way they used to be

I wanna see you more
I miss your company
I wish that things were still
The way they used to be

But only for a day
Just so I could say
That I remembered you
But only for a day
The way they used to be
But only for a day
Just so I can say...
