Here I sleep with one eye open
While you're dreaming next to me
Well at least I gave up hoping
Some kind of miracle would set me free

Starting over
God only knows where we've been
Starting over
Is not an option

You're like poison on my tongue
So bittersweet, but I like it, I love it
Poison on my tongue
And it keeps killing me, but I like it, I love it

Here's a pill
Why don't we take it 
Cause I heard it makes it all okay
And wait until we both are naked
Save the bullshit for another day

Starting over
God only knows where we've been
Starting over
Is not an option

You're like poison on my tongue
So bittersweet, but I like it, I love it
Poison on my tongue
And it keeps killing me, but I like it, I love it

You make me wanna jump off a ledge
Find a new life, come back from the dead
Do it again, do it again, do it again
Poison, and it keeps killing me, but I like it, I love it

(On my tongue, like poison on my tongue, she's like poison)

She's like poison!

She's like poison on my tongue
So bittersweet, but I like it, I love it
Poison on my tongue
And it keeps killing me, but I like it, I love it
