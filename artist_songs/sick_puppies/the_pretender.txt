I live with the life that I made 
I get from the things that I gave 
My arms are outstreached I hope for the best 
And act rich before I get paid 

I sold of my soul for these jeans 
Wherever I go its a scene 
Everyones staring as I act not caring 
Attention is breathing to me 

Oh I am the Pretender 

My confidence pours in this glass 
It helps me to hide from my past 
Life of the party I know everybody 
But noone gets beyond this mask 

Oh I am the Pretender 
Oh another Pretty Pretender 
Yeah 

I tell her whatever it takes 
My truth is as shifting as shapes 
I kiss and hug her and tell her I love her 
Then laugh as I tend her heartbreak 

Oh I am the Pretender 
Oh I'm just a Pretender 

Oh I am the Pretender 
Oh I am the Pretender
