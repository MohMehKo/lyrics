Opposite me on opposite sides
Throw bombs at each other
Hoping to resolve their disputes
They curse each others culture
When we fight back we use other weapons
The power of love sees us through
You might think your accomplishing something
But we will not bow down to you

Choose your life
Choose another's life
Choose to evolve

I will not believe what you believe because you
Tell me to
You can't stop us you can't change us cause
We've got better things to do
I look up to the sky and see a vision of life
That I thought in the past
Because one person chooses not to evolve the
Whole world has to get involved

With your tanks and your bombs you think that
You've already won
But what you've started you've only just 
Begun. It's only just begun!
