TV's should be in sync
I don't want to watch it
When people look like Japanese cartoons
You've got a product to sell
You should produce it well
Now I gotta return it and I don't want to

Been looking everywhere
But No-body seems to care
When I'm all alone

Where is everybody
Tell me what's happening
Am I supposed to know what to do?

But when I get to the shop they tell me it's not in stock
I guess it's true you get what you're given
With all my problems to date you'd think I would re-arrange
They say it will be back next season
