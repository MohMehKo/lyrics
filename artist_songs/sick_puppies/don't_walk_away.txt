I'm feeling so afraid
'Cause everything that I do lately
Makes you angry
I've never been so ashamed
It really felt like you and me were
Getting better

I hope that you still want me
I hope it's not too late

Don't walk away
And leave me without a reason
When there's too much to say
That hasn't been said
I know I was wrong 
And I'm sorry for making the same mistakes
Don't walk away

Can you really throw away
All the times that we've recovered
One another
And I know I make it hard
But how long should I pay for being
Unappealing

I know you want to want me
I see it in your eyes

Don't walk away
And leave me without a reason
When there's too much to say
That hasn't been said
I know I was wrong 
And I'm sorry for making the same mistakes
Don't walk away

Wish I could take it back
But you know I can't
I hope one day you understand
No this can't be the end
This is the end

And I know I make it hard

Don't walk away
And leave me without a reason
When there's too much to say
That hasn't been said
I know I was wrong 
And I'm sorry for making the same mistakes
Don't walk away

Don't walk away
(Don't walk away)
Don't walk away
(No, no, no!)
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
(Don't walk away)

It felt like you and me were getting better
