I waited for you yesterday
I waited and missed the last train
I waited to say that I'd fallen in love with your way
I waited for you yesterday
Eventually walked home in the rain
I waited to see if you felt the same for me

But you don't,
And you won't
Go against your asshole father
Going broke, 
Quitting dope 
For your folks
Why did I even bother?
Why did I?

I waited for minds to change
Pointing their fingers of blame
It's not my fault you're ashamed of how you feel

But you don't,
And you won't
Go against your asshole father
Going broke, 
Quitting dope 
For your folks
Why did I even bother?
Why did I?

Cause you don't 
Just admit it
Cause you won't 
Just admit it
Just admit it
Just admit it 
Just admit it
Just admit it
I called you a whore and broke down your door
But you don't even hate me!
And how could I heal when you won't even feel?
Why won't you hate me?!

But you don't and you won't
Go against your asshole father 
Going broke, 
Quitting dope 
For your folks
Why did I even bother?
Why did I?
But you don't cause your nothing but 
Broken down daddy's little daughter 
AREN'T CHA?!!
Going broke, 
Quitting dope 
For your folks
Why did I even bother?
Why did I?
