Waiting for another line
Cause you throw them at me all the time
Gotta get away from all her lies
And I gotta get away from mine

Tell me where to go
When fate won't deliver
Cause I can't forgive her
When I let her know
This pain I've been living
Will her next collision be me

Brings situation down
And her temper's always on the rise
I'm living what I've seen before
Well I won't take this anymore
It's time to hold this to the light

Tell me where to go
When fate won't deliver
Cause I can't forgive her
When I let her know
This pain I've been living
Will her next collision be me

Cause her mental prison is not my decision
So I'm cutting my losses this time
I'm no longer living through her tunnel vision

Tell me where to go
When fate won't deliver
Cause I can't forgive her
When I let her know
This pain I've been living
Will her next collision be me

Gotta get away from
Gotta get away
Gotta get away this time

Tell me where to go
When fate won't deliver
Cause I can't forgive her
When I let her know
This pain I've been living
Will her next collision be me
