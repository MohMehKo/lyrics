You mean everything to me, don't you know?
You're the thing that brought me back to life
I put you on a pedestal
You said I do, I said you will
Now tell me do you wanna
Keep any of this alive? (Alive?)

Didn't I didn't I love you?
Wasn't I good enough for you?
You're not walking away
You're not walking away
(Do you wanna keep this alive?)
You and I, we should be together
You and I, we're in this forever
You're not getting away
You're not getting away

Where would you be without me?
Just ask yourself
No one's gonna love you like I do
Look into my eyes and see
I could never let you leave
Now tell me do you wanna
Keep any of this alive? (Alive?)

Didn't I didn't I love you?
Wasn't I good enough for you?
You're not walking away
You're not walking away
(Don't you wanna keep this alive?)
You and I, we should be together
You and I, we're in this forever
You're not getting away
You're not getting away

Look at you.
Why are you so beautiful?
You're my only one
But you make it so hard for me
Just look at what you've done

Didn't I didn't I love you?
Wasn't I good enough for you?
You're not walking away
You're not walking away
(Do you wanna keep this alive?)
You and I, we should be together
You and I, we're in this forever
You're not getting away
You're not getting away
(Do you wanna keep this alive?)
You're not getting away
You're not getting away
(Do you wanna keep this alive?)
You're not getting away
You're not getting away
