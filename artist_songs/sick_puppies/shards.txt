So
The end is near
And there's so much unanswered, so little I understand
But here I am
I went from a stage to a circus, now I'm getting nervous

Questions, answers
Built on cancer
Next advance could be a loss
Waiting, burning
Now I'm learning
Time is running out

Shards of change
In broken frames
Is all that's left of me
The bitter taste
Of yesterday
Is nothing compared to the mess that I made today
Falling away

Lead myself
I never let it
All come down on suicide
This despair
Is everywhere
I'm sure you'd care
If you were me
Leavin' it all on the line
There's nobody to save me this time

Shards of change
In broken frames
Is all that's left of me
The bitter taste
Of yesterday
Is nothing compared to the mess that I made today
Falling away

So
The end is here
I'm on the edge of another adventure that I witness blind
How is it time
Now it's the place where I'm stranded, the place I abandoned

Shards of change
In broken frames
Is all that's left of me
The bitter taste
Of yesterday
Is nothing compared to the mess that I made today
Falling away
