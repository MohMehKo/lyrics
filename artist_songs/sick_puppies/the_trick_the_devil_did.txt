Out of reach in the sky
Most of you will never fly
Afraid to fail, afraid to try
But not me, I’d rather die

The trick the devil did
The trick the devil did
The trick the devil did was make me want it

Oh no, I’m fighting for my soul
I’m running from the battle
Most things I can handle

The trick the devil did
The trick the devil did
The trick the devil did was make me want it

Lone eyes, longer road
Up ahead we’re all alone
And what I want is what I’m owed
Too late to stay, too late to go

The trick the devil did
The trick the devil did
The trick the devil did was make me want it

Oh no, I’m fighting for my soul
I’m running from the battle
Most things I can handle
Oh no, I’m never letting go
I saw my name in blood
So I’m ready for the trouble

The trick the devil did
The trick the devil did
The trick the devil did was make me want it

And I can’t resist anything of temptation

Oh no, I’m fighting for my soul
I’m running from the battle
Most things I can handle

The trick, the trick
The trick the devil did
The trick the devil did was make me want it
