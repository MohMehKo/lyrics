How many moments have passed you by
How many tears have you let dry
Over every dream that you let die
How many things have you kept inside
How many things have you never tried
What would you do if you were out of time

Well you better run
You better run as fast as you can
Because the world tries to stop you
Stop you, stop you whenever it can
You better live like it’s the last day of your life
Because the world tries to stop you
Stop you, stop you as soon as you try

Would you shut your mouth when there’s something to say
Would you hear the truth at the end of the day
Would you close your eyes and just turn away
You gotta second chance and screwed it up
And now there’s always too much and never enough
How many times have you given up

Well you better run
You better run as fast as you can
Because the world tries to stop you
Stop you, stop you whenever it can
You better live like it’s the last day of your life
Because the world tries to stop you
Stop you, stop you as soon as you try

No one knows the answers to everything
Nobody knows what tomorrow brings
Nobody really knows anything

So you better run
You better run as fast as you can
Because the world tries to stop you
Stop you, stop you whenever it can
You better live like it’s the last day of your life
Because the world tries to stop you
Stop you, stop you as soon as you try

Tries to stop you, stop you
Stop you as soon as you try
Tries to stop you, stop you
Stop you as soon as you try
Tries to stop you, stop you
Stop you if you never try
