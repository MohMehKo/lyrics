Cause I feel like killing myself for Christmas 
I never got along real well with my mom or dad 
Hey I feel like killing myself for Christmas 
It’ll be the best, the best, the best Christmas day we ever had 

I could slice my wrist but you know it’ll only get real messy 
(Look at the mess you made) 
I could shoot myself but you know they would never recognize me 
(That’s not my boy, that’s not him) 
I can take that mistletoe 
And hang myself from the Christmas tree 
(That Christmas tree is coming out of your parking money) 

Cause I feel like killing myself for Christmas 
And before I go, I think I’ll unjack them all 
And tell all your kids that there’s no such thing as Santa 
(You know you where an accident, blame your mother) 
And before I go, I’ll steal your credit cards and max ‘em out 
Before you know, I’m buying porno 
Cause that’s all I want anyway 

Cause we feel like killing our self’s for Christmas 
We never got along real well with our moms or dads 
Yea We feel like killing our self’s for Christmas 
It’ll be the best, the best, the best Christmas day we ever had 

Cause we feel like killing our self’s for Christmas 
We never got along real well with our moms or dads 
Yea We feel like killing our self’s for Christmas 
It’ll be the best, the best, the best, the best, the best, the best Christmas day we ever had 

Bum bum bu bum GO FUCKING DIE!!! 
(But I don’t wanna die this year, that was last year)
