They stand before the alter
They stand before themselves
For richer or for poorer, 
in sickness and in health

Words are mostly meaningless the only truth that really is
(We’re all getting) by telling lies, telling lies
(Everyone we love) is telling lies, telling lies
Maybe that’s why I never felt like I could look you in the eyes
(Everyone alive) is telling lies

She feels the whole world on her shoulders as she tucks her kid in bed
It gets better when you’re older and they believe the words she says

Words are mostly meaningless, the only truth that really is
(We don’t really mind) telling lies, telling lies
(cause we’re all getting by) telling lies, telling lies
Maybe that’s why I never felt like I could trust any friend of mine
(everyone alive) is telling lies, telling lies

She walks naked in the bedroom as I’m lying on my back
And says "baby please by honest have I been getting fat?"

But my words are mostly meaningless the only truth that really is
(Everyone we love) is telling lies, telling lies
(Everyone we know) is telling lies, telling lies
Maybe that is why I can justify the way I live my life
(Cause everyone alive) is telling lies
