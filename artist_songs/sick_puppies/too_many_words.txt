I've tried to balance these lives that we are living
You always feel justified but you never feel forgiving
I woke up one morning to find myself wrapped in the things I swore I'd never touch.
And here I am again trying to save what's left of you and I
So why aren't you satisfied?

I reached out, fell short
Now you're hurt, too many words
Breaking the silence
I felt it, bled it, screamed it,
It only gets worse
And it kills me what's in me too angry for us to survive
I used too many words tonight

I tried to get it right
But I was just wastin' my time
'cause you never compromised when it came to us
We struggle and fall apart we build it back to static start
The endless accusations I can't believe we made it this far.

I reached out, fell short

Now you're hurt, too many words
Breaking the silence
I felt it, bled it, screamed it,
It only gets worse
And it kills me what's in me too angry for us to survive
I used too many words tonight

Waking alone tomorrow, has gotta be better than this

I reached out, fell short
Now you're hurt, too many words
Breaking the silence
I felt it, bled it, screamed it,
It only gets worse
I used too many words tonight
Too many words
Too many words
Too many words
Too many words
