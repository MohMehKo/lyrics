I'm paralyzed going out of my mind
Can't seem to help myself
Hear your voice, see your face, call your name
Stuck in a living hell
And I sleep just to leave this reality
Then I wake and it takes you away from me
I can't believe you and I, are out of time
And I never said goodbye

One more step to the edge, I can't let go

You were the only thing worth living for
How can you go and leave me here, I'm all alone

So I walk this earth half alive until the day I die
I'm killing time, killing time
For you

Disappeared without a trace, I can't erase
The fact that you're really gone
Living with the memories, It's killing me
I'm barely holding on

One more step to the edge, I can't let go

You were the only thing worth living for
How can you go and leave me here, I'm all alone

So I walk this earth half alive until the day I die
I'm killing time, killing time

If only I could find my way to you
I wouldn't have to hurt the way I do 
I wish that I could say I'm not okay
Wasting this life away

You were suppose to be invincible
How can you go and leave me here, I'm all alone

You were the only thing worth living for
How can you go and leave me here, I'm all alone

So I walk this Earth half alive until the day I die
I'm killing time, killing time, killing time
For you
For you
