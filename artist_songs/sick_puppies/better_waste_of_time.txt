This step I bet you’d think I’d forget
But I couldn’t look away like an accident
Somebody left no survivors
Can’t believe what an idiot I was
I said I said you were the one
I guess it’s easier said than it was done
I won’t buy but it’s you I sold
You turn on me for truth be told

This is the last goodbye
So I’ll keep searching, searching until I find
A better waste of time
Save your words, I’ll save my life
And if I’m searching, searching until I die
It’s better waste of time

Gloves off, it’s better to feel for me
I’m not afraid of catching your disease
What you got shouldn’t cut like cancer
Leaving you was my only answer
It might be hard it must admit
Nothing’s better in bed than a crazy bitch
I tried hard to make everything work
But when you miss me I hope it hurts

This is the last goodbye
So I’ll keep searching, searching until I find
A better waste of time
Save your words, I’ll save my life
And if I’m searching, searching until I die
It’s better waste of time

This is the last goodbye
So I’ll keep searching, searching until I find
A better waste of time
Save your words, I’ll save my life
And if I’m searching, searching until I die
It’s better waste of time
