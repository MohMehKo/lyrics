Well maybe i'm wrong but it seems to me that todays music's all about me, me, me
Just show me your money, give me the hunnies and i'll give you what i feel like buddy
Pastel images are still giving us everything we've heard before with some more
Sex appeal that isn't really real but everybody seems to fall FOR IT!!

All the pop groups yeah they're raking it in while other demo tapes are chucked in the bin
Meanwhile all the real struggling bands that never had a clue, never had a chance

We are the rock kids
We don't want your pop shit
We want something hard to rock to
Not some fucked up programmed pop tune

We are the rock kids
We don't want your pop shit
We want something hard to rock to
Not some fucked up programmed pop tune

It gives me the shits that we're jumping thru hoops while it's handed out like candy to the girl and boy groups
You know the backstreet boys and britney spears, where they gonna be in the next few years?
We've got bullshit songs written by old farts in the hopes that one of them will maybe climb up the charts
People are aching for something new something simple, honest, true AND NOT THIS FUCKED UP MONEY MAKING BULLSHIT!!

We are the rock kids
We don't want your pop shit
We want something hard to rock to
Not some fucked up programmed pop tune

We are the rock kids
We don't want your pop shit
We want something hard to rock to
Not some fucked up programmed pop tune

It's all become subliminal
It's no longer traditional
It's just compromising and advertising
So they can see their numbers rising

It's all become subliminal
It's no longer traditional
It's just compromising and advertising
Can you see those numbers rising?

Well are you gonna fall for it?
Are you gonna be his sheep?
You know it's already started
Are you a statistic?

Are you going to conform?
Or fight against the norm?
and when are you gonna stand up and say
FUCK YOU ALL I'LL GO MY OWN WAY!!

We are the rock kids
We don't want your pop shit
We want something hard to rock to
Not some fucked up programmed pop tune

We are the rock kids
We don't want your pop shit
We want something hard to rock to
Not some fucked up programmed pop tune
