I know this is gonna hurt
When I get what I deserve
Every time that I am wrong
You are right when you're wrong
I get lost inside the hate
You don't talk to me for days
I know we can make it right 
as long as we are alive
Yeah!

You know its tearing me apart
I know this isn't who we are
So I will fight for you
And there is beautiful chaos

There are times I wanna leave
There are time I wanna scream
There are days I'm full of doubt
Feels like there is no way out
If there's one thing that I know
I would not let you go
I would die without you here
It's the only thing I fear
Yeah!

(And I wouldn't change a thing)
Even though sometimes it seems
We were never meant to be

You know its tearing me apart
I know this isn't who we are
So I will fight for you
And there is beautiful chaos

And if the sky begins to fall
You'll be the shelter where I run
You're everything I'm not
Beautiful chaos!

Beautiful [x3] Chaos

You know its tearing me apart
I know this isn't who we are
So I will fight for you
And there is beautiful chaos

And if the sky begins to fall
You'll be the shelter where I run
You're everything I'm not
Beautiful chaos!
