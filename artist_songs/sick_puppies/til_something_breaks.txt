[Verse 1]
Face me, you won't escape from me
I gotta make you see
what's keeping me alive
inside only the blame survives
now it's too late to hide
It's down to you and I

[Pre-chorus]
Fake how you treat me
and make me believe

[Chorus]
I've had more than I can take
There's nothing you can say
cause everything I wanted
you took away
That way you made me feel
was never even real
you made me now I won't stop
Til something breaks

[Verse 2]
You've shown me just what you want with me
the lie everyone believes
and now it's coming out
face down, screaming without a sound
you oughta know by now
it's gonna come around

[Chorus]
I've had more than I can take
I'm drowning in the pain
cause everything I wanted
you took away
That way you made me feel
was never even real
you made me now I won't stop
Til something breaks

I've had more than I can take
you'll never know the pain
cause everything I wanted
you took away
That way you made me feel
was never even real
you made me now I won't stop
Til something breaks

It's more than I can take
you'll never know the pain
cause everything I wanted
you took away
That way you made me feel
was never even real
you made me now I won't stop
Til something breaks
