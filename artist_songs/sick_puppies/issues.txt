I wanna wake up
I've been walking in my sleep to long
Wake up
I'm so sick of dreaming

I wanna slow down
I wanna be part of what is happening around me
Without breathing
Without feeling
Without screaming
So I'm leaving

[Chorus:]
I'm consciously unconscious
Why am I filled with hate?
I'd like to blame my parents
I'm sure you'd do the same
Swallow the hurt
Spit out the jerk that's to afraid

I turn the page
To a chapter that they thought was just a phase
But it consumed me

You're right I am a failure
And when my life turns to shit
It won't have anything to do with the fact that it's all you ever taught me how to do
So you can relax!

Without feeling
Without breathing
Now I'm leaving

[Chorus]

Turn the page
I've been hiding,
Drowning,
I've been running,
Starving,
I've been feeling nothing

[Chorus]
