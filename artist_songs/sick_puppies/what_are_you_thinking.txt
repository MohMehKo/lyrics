You think you know me so well or what’s good for me
Do you really expect me to believe your honesty
You’re like everyone else, go practice what you preach
You think you own me and that I owe you apologies

But you don’t know me
Like you think you know me
What the fuck

What are you thinking
You gotta be crazy
You got nothing on me
No, nothing on me
This is my life
Can’t take it from me

What are you thinking
You gotta be crazy
You got nothing on me
No, nothing on me
This is my life
Can’t take it from me

You’ve been trying to kill every part of me
Because it’s something that you know you’ll never be
I know I should think that I know everything
But coming from you it doesn’t mean a damn thing

But you don’t know me
Like you think you know me
What the hell

What are you thinking
You gotta be crazy
You got nothing on me
No, nothing on me
This is my life
Can’t take it from me

What are you thinking
You gotta be crazy
You got nothing on me
No, nothing on me
This is my life
Can’t take it from me

What are you thinking
What are you thinking
You don’t know
You don’t know me
You don’t own
You don’t own me anymore
You don’t own me
You don’t know me anymore

What are you thinking
You gotta be crazy
You got nothing on me
No, nothing on me
This is my life
Can’t take it from me

What are you thinking
You gotta be crazy
You got nothing on me
No, nothing on me
This is my life
Can’t take it from me

This is my life
Can’t take it from me
This is my life
Can’t take it from me

(What are you thinking)
This is my life
Can’t take it from me
(What are you thinking)
This is my life
Can’t take it from me

You don’t know me
