I see through your intentions, I am just another pawn
Been cut by all the edges of this earth I'm walkin' on
Your tongue is like a dagger, I'm the target you desire
You got me in your sights 'cause I was born into the fire
Oh (I can't escape it)

You're tearing me apart and if you could see my heart
It is black and blue, so black and blue
I'm dying for an exit if I can find it
I'm comin' after you, comin' after you
It's all I know

This won't kill me I won't let it
Fuck with me and you'll regret it

Just because when you were young the same was done to you
Doesn't mean that you can use that pitiful excuse
You've wasted all my innocence, you're turning me into
Someone I said I'd never be, somebody just like you
(I can't escape it)

You're tearing me apart and if you could see my heart
It is black and blue, so black and blue
I'm dying for an exit if I can find it
I'm comin' after you, comin' after you
It's all I know

(You can't escape it)

You're tearing me apart and if you could see my heart
It is black and blue (so black and blue)
I'm dying for an exit if I can find it
I'm comin' after you
So black and blue

You're tearing me apart and if you could see my heart
It is black and blue, so black and blue
I'm dying for an exit if I can find it
I'm comin' after you, comin' after you
It's all I know

This won't kill me I won't let it
Fuck with me and you'll regret it
