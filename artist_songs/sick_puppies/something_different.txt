Long ago this is how I feel
Got my head in my hands and got my contraband, waiting for machine

And I've got my head in my hands
waiting for the sign to come

Well I've got my head in my hands I'm a human contraband
waiting for a sign to come

Inside on overtime hoping my baby's there
Inside on overtime hoping my baby's there

(And now for something completely different)

That's how I feel but I'm willing to let it go
hoping that I'll have something I can show
hoping there's something else for her to feel

Go go go go go go go go

Inside of me and I'm a human contraband
waiting for a sign to come

Inside on overtime hoping my baby's there
Inside on overtime hoping my baby's there

(And now for something completely different)

That's how I feel but I'm willing to let it go
hoping that I'll have something I can show
hoping there's something else for her to feel
