So I don't belong but tell me I'm so different from you
Why is that so wrong
I'm not afraid 'cause I'm not the only one that feels this way
I'm better off alone

Can you see inside I'm dying in a living hell
But I never pretend to be someone else
I'm not alright, but I will fight until the end
'Cause I won't let it go 'till you let me live

Let me live, let me live

What's done is done
The blood's not on my hands it's on your tongue
Your words they cut so deep
So go pledge your allegiance to digging your own grave
'Cause I won't be the victim of everything you hate 

(Look into my eyes)

Can you see inside I'm dying in a living hell
But I never pretend to be someone else
I'm not alright, but I will fight until the end
'Cause I won't let it go 'till you let me live

Let me live, let me live

Can you see inside I'm dying in a living hell
But I never pretend to be someone else
I'm not alright, but I will fight until the end
'Cause I won't let it go 'till you let me live

Can you see inside I'm dying in a living hell
But I never pretend to be someone else
I'm not alright, but I will fight until the end
'Cause I won't let it go 'till you let me live

Let me live, let me live
