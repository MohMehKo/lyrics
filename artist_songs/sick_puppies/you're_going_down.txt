Define your meaning of war
To me it's what we do when we're bored
I feel the heat comin' off of the blacktop
And it makes me want it more
Because I'm hyped up out of control
If it's a fight, I'm ready to go
I wouldn't put my money on the other guy
If you know what I know that I know

It's been a long time coming
And the table's turned around
'Cause one of us is going
One of us is going down
I'm not running,
It's a little different now
'Cause one of us is going
One of us is going down

Define your meaning of fun
To me it's when we're getting it done
[The explicit version: "Is it fuckin', druggin' or guns"]
I feel the heat comin' off of the blacktop
So get ready for another one
Let's take a trip down memory lane
(Do you remember me?)
The words circling in my brain
(And what you did to me)
You can treat this like another all the same
But don't cry like a bitch when you feel the pain

It's been a long time coming
And the table's turned around
'Cause one of us is going
One of us is going down
I'm not running,
It's a little different now
'Cause one of us is going
One of us is going down

This is hardly worth fighting for
But it's the little petty shit that I can't ignore
With my fist in your face, and your face on the floor
[The explicit version: "When my fist hits your face and your face hits the floor"]

It'll be a long time coming
But you got the message now
'Cause I was never going
Yeah, you're the one that's going down

One of us is going down
I'm not running,
It's a little different now
'Cause one of us is going
One of us is going down

One of us is going down
