Let’s do this 

Faking falls 
Stop and stall 
Take it all 
Fact is I’m taking mine 
I’m taking mine 

Time is up 
Out of luck 
Should've stood up when you had the time 
But you’re out of time 

Let’s do this (fight, fight, fight…) 
Lock and load 
Rock and roll 
Bitch it's all over 
You’re going down 
You’re going down 

Get ready to settle the score 
And get ready to face the floor 
'Cause it's time to remember it (war) 

This is war 
And it’s on tonight 
So get up and fight 
Get up and fight 
You had all your life 
To run and hide 
Now step up, now step up 
Let’s do this 

Sat around 
Going down 
How about a little reaction, man? 
You can barely stand 
Bitch slap, slow attack 
Man, that was practically suicide 
Next in line 

(Go) 
Fight [X8]
