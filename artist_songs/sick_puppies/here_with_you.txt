You give me highs that lose my breath
That leave me wanting more
You gave me looks I won't forget
That left me on the floor
You're every thing and nothing else
You sail the world it seems
Until the lights go dark, until the end of me

I'd give up all my tomorrows
To be here with you
Walk off the world just to follow
To follow you
You're every waking hour
You're all that time devours
I'd give up all my tomorrows
To be here with you

I'll pray for this to never end
'Cause I just couldn't breathe
And now the fear of losing you
Is the ghost that haunts my dreams
And if you tell me all is lost
Then I will give you hope
'Cause without you I don't exist, and I go cold

I'd give up all my tomorrows
To be here with you
Walk off the world just to follow
To follow you
You're every waking hour
You're all that time devours
I'd give up all my tomorrows
To be here with you

Now I see what I couldn't believe
All the things you were saying to me
It's taken me so long, it's take me so long
All my walls they are falling to dust
Until you I never knew how to trust
It's taken me so long, it's take me so long

You gave me looks I won't forget
You left me on the floor
You gave me highs that lose my breath

I'd give up all my tomorrows
To be here with you
Walk off the world just to follow
To follow you
You're every waking hour
You're all that time devours
I'd give up all my tomorrows
To be here with you
To be here with you
To be here with you
To be here with you
I'd give up all my tomorrows
To be here with you
