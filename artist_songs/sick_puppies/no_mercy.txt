Pull me down under water
I want to fight to breathe
Lay me on a bed of roses
And push down until I bleed
I’m true to my virtues
I'm worth being abused

Light me up like a flame
And burn me to the ground
Break the skin a little more
I know that you know how
But you never want to
Why are you so cruel

Show me no mercy
I want you to hurt me
I want to feel it all
Show me no mercy
You shouldn’t be sorry
When all I want is more
If you keep loving me you'll kill me
You gotta make it hurt
Don’t show me no mercy
Don’t take it easy on me

Take me to your happy place
And bury me alive
Resurrect me like I'm Jesus
And kiss me when I die
I know that you love me
So won’t you show me

Show me no mercy
I want you to hurt me
I want to feel it all
Show me no mercy
You shouldn’t be sorry
When all I want is more
If you keep loving me you'll kill me
You gotta make it hurt
Don’t show me no mercy
Don’t take it easy on me

Don’t take it easy on me
Don’t take it easy
Don’t take it easy
Don’t take it easy on me

Show me no mercy
I want you to hurt me
I want to feel it all
Show me no mercy
You shouldn’t be sorry
When all I want is more
If you keep loving you'll kill me
You gotta make it hurt
Don’t show me no mercy
Don’t take it easy on me

Don’t take it easy on me
