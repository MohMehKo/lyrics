(Howard Howard crying in the shower.
Howard Howard been in there for hours.)

Somewhere inside this closet
Your whole life exists
An evil little secret
That keeps you so nervous
You're boarding up your windows
In fetal on the floor
But what you're keeping out is on the wrong side of the door

I know the reason you're running scared
I met the monster inside your head
You never know the feeling of being alive
It's not enough, it never stops coming
It's not enough, so take a breath, say good-bye

Your skin is crawling on you
The shadows on the ground
And now the room is spinning
Oh god what was that sound
The fear is paralyzing
Trapped here inside yourself
Your will to live is dying, is dying
You're dying

I know the reason you're running scared
I met the monster inside your head
You never know the feeling of being yourself
It's not enough, it never stops coming
It's not enough, so take a breath, say good-bye

Say good-bye

You're dying now
Dying now

I know the reason you're running scared
I met the monster inside your head
You never know the feeling of being alive
It's not enough, it never stops coming
It's not enough, so take a breath, say good-bye
