You're everything I never want to be
And you're manipulating everyone you see
The innocence you hide behind
But you are dressed up as a lie
'Cause nothing is every really what it seems

You used to be someone, 
Someone that I could trust
Fuck all that you've become 
'Cause no one's gonna save you
Now I can see right through
Right through the best of you
You're lost in the atmosphere
But I can see it all so clear
(All so clear)

You victimize yourself until you win
Do you realize your fate is wearing thin
I guess you never know someone 
Until the end has come and gone
You're like a parasite under my skin

You used to be someone, 
Someone that I could trust
Fuck all that you've become 
'Cause no one's gonna save you
Now I can see right through
Right through the best of you
You're lost in the atmosphere
But I can see it all so clear

You've seen the light
And it burns your eyes
(Its all so clear, its all so clear!)
You know your sins
You Charlatan!

You used to be someone, 
Someone that I could trust
Fuck all that you've become 
No one's gonna save you
(No one's gonna save you!)

You used to be someone, 
Someone that I could trust
Fuck all that you've become 
'Cause no one's gonna save you
Now I can see right through
Right through the best of you
You're lost in the atmosphere
But I can see it all so clear
I can see it all so clear
