I wrestle with my thoughts at night
Anchored to the ropes I tied to myself
Heaviness in my both my legs
Like I walked a thousand miles a day

If I could stand on top of my world
I’d still be looking up at stars that I can never touch

When a sky full of tears falls to the earth
I gotta believe we’re healing now
Now before you give up, before it gets worse
I have to believe we’re healing now

Healing now
Healing now
Healing now

From where I stand it’s hard to see
What anyone has to offer me today
Courage comes from letting go
And loving everything you fear away

If I could stand on top of my world
I’d still be looking up at stars that I can never touch

When a sky full of tears falls to the earth
I gotta believe we’re healing now
Now before you give up, before it gets worse
I have to believe we’re healing now

Healing now
Healing now
Healing now

I dream about war
I live without peace
A cell without bars
Breathe air I can’t breathe
I choose to believe
In the face of my doubts
I am what I see
I am healing now

Healing now

When a sky full of tears falls to the earth
I gotta believe we’re healing now
Now before you give up, before it gets worse
I have to believe we’re healing now

Healing now
Healing now
Healing now
