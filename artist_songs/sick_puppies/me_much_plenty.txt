Don't want to be lost anymore,
I find myself at the door,
But I'm to scared to go.

Been in this life for to long
I wanna see the sun
Inside my mind INSIDE MY MIND

[Break:]
HEY! HEY!
GET THE FUCK OUT OF ME SAY!

[Chorus:]
Do you know what you came for?
If you don't even know what's the point in being alive?
GET UP GET UP
Get up and fight
GET UP GET UP
Just live your life.

[Bridge:]
Cause everyday is not a waste
It's all the same everyday
Cause what you see isn't always what you get.
