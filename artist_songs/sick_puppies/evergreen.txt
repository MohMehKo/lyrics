You run away from what you know
You've stolen something that you do not own
And as the lifeless fall I know you will too
Because you know that I've got nothing left to lose

Been on the evergreen and I
Know what I want to see
But I can't make it alone

You run away from what you did
Your selfishness deserves a place in sin
For everytime that I am fought
This bleeding lifeless falls
Cause I know you've been running around for free
And I know I've raped and afraid
