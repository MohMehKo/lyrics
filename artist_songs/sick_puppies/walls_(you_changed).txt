Black hole to nowhere you're lost and you don't care
But I'm still here fighting to breath
Watching the world from a top your high tower
A fool calling himself the king
And I watched you change

Dead on arrival you say its survival
A self preservation technique
You lace your defenses, its stupid its senseless
To turn into my enemy
And I watched you change

When the walls come down
You got what you wanted now didn't you
You'll never break me down
It's killing you now
Killing you

You were devoted 'til your head exploded
And vanished into the debris
Counting your losses, discerning, dishonest
You dealt in the wrong chemistry
And I watched you change

When the walls come down
You got what you wanted now didn't you
You'll never break me down
It's killing you now
Killing you
(Killing you)
Killing you

And I watched you change
Yeah I watched you change

When the walls come down
You got what you wanted

When the walls come down
You got what you wanted now didn't you
You'll never break me down
It's killing you now
Killing you
(Killing you)
Killing you
