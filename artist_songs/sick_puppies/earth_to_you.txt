There's a man stuck in the moon
Sifting through the history of you
Learning all the secrets you never knew

Feeding you the product in bed
Seeping poison in to your head
Reaping havoc turning your brown eyes blue

You're not dead
You're just in your head
Can you hear me

Wake up and break away from the machine holding you down
Make up for all the time you lost when you were tied and bound
Earth to you
Over and out

Lazy fattened up with the fear
Wasting days turn months into years
There's a wake up call but you cannot hear

They've insulated all of the walls
Barred windows and screened all the calls
So I've come to make all the curtains fall

You're not dead
You're just in your head
Can you hear me

Wake up and break away from the machine holding you down
Make up for all the time you lost when you were tied and bound
Earth to you
Over and out
Over and out

Wake the fuck up
Wake the fuck up

Open your eyes

Wake up and break away from the machine holding you down
Make up for all the time you lost when you were tied and bound
Wake up
Wake up
I really need you here right now

Earth to you
Over and out
Earth to you
Over and out
Earth to you
Over and out

Open your eyes
