Its been a week since I talked to you
Maybe a phone call is overdue
But this time I fear there's nothing I can do
And I know it seems a little late
To reach out and try to set it straight
For just a moment I thought I'd be fine without you

But not now!

I don't wanna lose you now
I don't wanna lose you now
I feel sick when you're not around
I don't think I can let it go

I know it seems like we're out of time
And people think that we lost our minds
With all the heartache and all the fights
It seems impossible
Wish there was something that I could say
To make this nightmare just go away
I really thought we would be okay
And I'd make it through this

But not now!

I don't wanna lose you now
I don't wanna lose you now
I feel sick when you're not around
I don't think I can let it go

How could I just stand by
And watch our world wither and die
And how could you forget the truth 
And all the shit we made it through 
And how could we just both agree 
To carry on and let it be
We'll never know
We just let go

Not now
Not now
Not now

I don't wanna lose you now
I don't wanna lose you now
I believe in the life we found

Not now

I don't wanna lose you now
I don't wanna lose you now
I don't wanna lose you
Not now, not now
