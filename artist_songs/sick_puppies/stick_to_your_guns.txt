It's a waste of time to try and please everyone around
You can't believe the words you hear that try to bring you down
You can't change what you can't change
So don't even try

So burn all of the pages to erase the part of you
That ever thought that you could never be who you wanted to
You can't change what you can't change
So don't even try

You're not innocent now
'Cause your whole world is inside out
No, don't give up what you believe in
This time there's no sleep until you die

So pray to your god
Stick to your guns
'Cause you're on your own

Start dig to your nails into the wall in front of you
'Cause when you climb over the top
You feel bullet proof
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
You're coming alive
You're coming alive

You're not innocent now
'Cause your whole world is inside out
No, don't give up what you believe in
This time there's no sleep until you die

So pray to your god
Stick to your guns
'Cause your on your own

This illusion
Your confusion
Take it all and
Break right through it
Fear is fading
Constant craving
It's yours to take now
Why are you waiting?

You're not innocent now
'Cause your whole world is inside out
No, don't give up what you believe in
This time there's no sleep until you die

So pray to your god
Stick to your guns
So pray to your god
Stick to your guns
'Cause you're on your own
