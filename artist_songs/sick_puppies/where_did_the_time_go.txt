Tomorrow is ending as fast as I’m spending
Most days I’m pretending I’m hyper extending
All my dreams and all my uncertainties
Onto a speeding train

Where does the time go
And what have I done
The days keep getting shorter
But I’m still on the run
I’m losing the battle
I live in the shadows
Where did the time go
Hell if I know

The summer’s a shorter, my sister’s older
She cries on shoulder, I’m crossing the border
With all my dreams and all my uncertainties
Onto a speeding train

Where does the time go
And what have I done
The days keep getting shorter
But I’m still on the run
I’m losing the battle
I live in the shadows
Where did the time go
Hell if I know

Eyes closed
I’m remembering why people come and go
Like dominos the days keep passing by
I realize I never learned how to fly
Is there still time, is there still time

Where does the time go
And what have I done
The days keep getting shorter
But I’m still on the run
I’m losing the battle
I live in the shadows
Where did the time go
Hell if I know

Where did the time go
Hell if I know
