Been away so long I don't remember my face
That's how long it's been
I'd like to tell you what I'm facing now
But it ruins everything

Been away so long I don't remember this place
And I'm feeling scared
Of course you don't know what I've been going through
But I'd like to think you care

Everyday is change
With a different problem to face
Everybody feels a different type of strange
But you don't throw it away

Nowadays everybody's trying to be
The latest real real cool hip thing know what I mean
Not about you it's how you arrange
And it doesn't matter that everything's going to change
Cause you are you and I am me
we are all in control of our own destiny
Follow your heart open your mind
And enjoy your life it only comes one time
