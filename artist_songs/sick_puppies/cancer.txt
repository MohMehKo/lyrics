Tell me all your plans and I'll laugh back in your face
Preach me your religion if you're dumb enough to pray

I tried to make a change to get a better way
to make a little more money
I tried to get away to see if I could stay
and look what I became, honey

[Chorus]
What is it I'm after
Searching for disaster
Watching my whole life flash in front of my eyes
We've been given answers
Still we're walking cancers
Dressed up as a life

Get all your news from a corporate company
Trade in your opinon for a gallon of gasoline
Go!

I tried to get away to see if I could stay
And look what I became, honey

[Chorus]
What is it I'm after
Searching for disaster
Watching my whole life flash in front of my eyes
We've been given answers
Still we're walking cancers
Dressed up as a life
Dressed up as a life
Dressed up as a life

This life is a waste of life
This life...
Is a fucking lie!

[Chorus]
What is it I'm after
Searching for disaster
Watching my whole life flash in front of my eyes
We've been given answers
Still we're walking cancers
Dressed up as a life
Dressed up as a life
Dressed up as a life
Dressed up as...
