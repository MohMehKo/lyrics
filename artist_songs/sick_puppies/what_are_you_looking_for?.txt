I walk the line of the disappointed
I celebrate when I'm in pain
My heart and mind can be disjointed
I built a bed in this hole I made
I recognize that I'm damaged
I sympathize that you are too
But I wanna breathe without feelin' so self-conscious
But it's hard when the world's starin' at you

Another piece of the puzzle, that doesn't fit
You throw your arms up, you're so damn sick of it
What are you working for
What are you searching for
Love
You won't be thinking of cars when
You're on your death bed and dyin'
You'll only be thinkin' of what you are paying for,
What you are praying for
Love

You join the line of the getting richer
You keep your pace but it's movin' slow
You are defined by all that you have hoarded
But you're surprised it doesn't fill up the hole.

Another piece of the puzzle, that doesn't fit
You throw your arms up, you're so damn sick of it
What are you coping for

What are you hoping for
Love
You won't be thinking of cars when
You're on your death bed and dyin'
You'll only be thinkin' of what you are paying for,
What you are praying for
Love

I'll never be what I see on the TV screen
I just keep dreaming of what I'm never gonna be
I can't think of a better way to waste my time then try

Another piece of the puzzle, that doesn't fit
You throw your arms up, you're so damn sick of it
What are you hurtin' for
What are you searching for
Love love love love
You won't be thinking of cars when
You're on your death bed and dyin'
You'll only be thinkin' of what you are paying for,
What you are praying for
Love love love love

You won't be thinkin' of cars when
You're on your death bed and dyin'
You'll only be thinkin' of what are you workin' for,
What are you waitin' for
