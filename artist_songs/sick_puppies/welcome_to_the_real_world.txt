Welcome to the real world!

Where people die and pain is real
No one gives a fuck about how you feel
Everything has a price or a consequence
No one has the time or the tolerance
To listen to you
When your crying boohoo
I don't know what to do
My rent is overdue
pay it! PAY IT!
And if you don't have the cash
Then your out on your ass.

Cause everyone has trouble achieving
Everyone has time disbelieving
May not be what you heard

Welcome to the real world!

Now I must admit i'm new to it myself 
But I can understand how everyone else
Has their own way to feel and their own way to deal
With the same shit I do
But it just coming over and over and over again
Yeah thats right till the day your world ends
I'm sure you'll wake up one day thinking thats funny
Having no luck and no friends and no money

But I know your on your way
And I know you'll be okay
So there's no need to be afraid
