I had a dream you had a weapon
I couldn’t see it in the dark of the night
It’s easy to hide
Under a very black sky

Over the Moon, just beyond Saturn
I watched in vain as the missiles took flight
We lost our lives
Under a very black sky

Under a black sky
Under a black sky
Under a black sky

Colors explode under your microscope
But just through my eyes it’s all black and white
I lost my mind
Under a very black sky

We live our lives mostly pretending
You have a secret, you’ll never know mine
I'll wear my disguise
Under a very black sky

It’s easy to love you
Easy as hell
When you’re anyone, anyone else
It’s so hard to fake it
I know you can tell
If you’re anyone, anyone else

If you’re anyone, anyone else
If you’re anyone, anyone

Under a black sky
Under a black sky
Under a black sky

At first you believe and then you start lying
Swallowing pain like it’s shredded-up glass
I’m bleeding inside
Under a very black sky

Disappointment is cruel but hope can be crueler
I felt them both 'til I thought I could die
Now all my tears are dry
Under a very black sky

Under a black sky
Under a black sky
Under a black sky
Under a black sky

Under a black sky
Under a black sky
Under a black sky
Under a black sky

Under a black sky
Under a black sky
