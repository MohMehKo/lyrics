Another night in my own skin I don't know what I'm in for
I just wanna know when this will end so I can bury it all
I just can't let go even when I start to lose control
'Cause everything will be okay

If I stay

I never thought I would survive on my own
I feel it haunting me inside it's all I know
I can't breathe I choke on silence 
But I'll stand when all the light is gone
I'll keep holding on

Another day that goes to waste I don't what I'm here for
And you could blink another escape you never know it 'cause your
Eyes won't let me in so I fall back into the dark again
'Cause everything will be okay

If I stay

I never thought I would survive on my own
I feel it haunting me inside it's all I know
I can't breathe I choke on silence 
But I'll stand when all the light is gone
I'll keep holding on

Every cut, every wound I show
Is a victory you won't know
In the end it'll wash away
If I stay
Every cut, every wound I show
Is a victory you won't know
In the end it'll wash away
If I...

If I stay
If I stay

I never thought I would survive on my own
I feel it haunting me inside it's all I know
I can't breathe I choke on silence 
But I'll stand when all the light is gone
I'll keep holding on
