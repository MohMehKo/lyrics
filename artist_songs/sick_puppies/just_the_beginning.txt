The lie you made that I replay
Again and again you keep taunting me
The high you gave, the ride, the game
Belligerently using all of me
(But never again)

When your world stops turning
And you start burning alive right in front of me
I hope you feel everything
Hurt so deep and there's no relief 
And you know that this is just the beginning 
Of the end

Reliving all the dark days I could have sworn 
There was nobody else that could take your place
And it was hard to see it all unfolding
As I watched you fall from grace
(You fell right on your face)
But never again

When your world stops turning
And you start burning alive right in front of me
I hope you feel everything
Hurt so deep and there's no relief 
And you know that this is just the beginning 
Of the end

When your world stops turning
And you start burning alive right in front of me
I hope you feel everything
Hurt so deep and there's no relief 
And you know that this is just the beginning 
When your world stops turning
And you start burning alive right in front of me
I hope you feel everything
Hurt so deep and there's no relief 
And you know that this is just the beginning 
Of the end
(Of the end, of the end)
(Oh)
