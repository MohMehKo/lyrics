I find myself in wicked cress - I’m such a shitty mess
I’ll catch my bated breath and lose my fucking mind
Koffee for the killerman - you need to understand
Psychopaths and sycophants are not a waste of time

But all I know is heroes come and villains go
Just give the lunatic a chance
And all I know is something out is something old
I’ll never win, I’m just a man… but I don’t care

The deadly frost is in the green - you don’t know what I mean
You’ll find the Benzedrine can throw you off the edge
Who needs a therapist? Too bad I’m not convinced
God, I’m sick of this - just save yourself or I’ll be dead

All I know is heroes come and villains go
Just give the lunatic a chance
All I know is something out is something old
I’ll never win - I’m just a man

The conflagration isn't yours - your Bible is a war
Once we've broken through, there’s nothing to protect
Fetal bullets make you weak - your tremors can’t compete
The human’s obsolete - what do you have left?

All I know is heroes come and villains go
Just give the lunatic a chance
All I know is something out is something old
I’ll never win - I’m just a man

All I know is everywhere you come and go
There’s nothing new to understand
All I know is nowhere’s safe and no one’s home
I’ll never win, I’m just a man… but I don’t care
Black John is always there
