"I used to think if I die in an evil place then my soul wouldn't be able to make it to Heaven, but now...fuck"

Everyday I get closer and closer to releasing this on you
Roll it in, I can snap it in half and let the other make this happen to you
All I see is someone afraid of my eyes
It's inside me
You're all abortions to me
Fucking lying to me as if I don't need an apology
I don't give a fuck who you think you are
Go away

Anyway, you make me sick and it doesn't help your case
It's so serious I can't stop laughing
And I cannot wash my mouth of this taste

You try to destroy
Afraid to face the facts
I don't know how much longer I can live a lie
I want the whole world to burn every single thing
For once it's not on my head

Killing everyone
Killing everything
Killing everyone
Killing everything

My arms are dead and my veins are too
And I'm starting to believe
My head is shaking and I feel my smile
Like I've written this on a hardened ?

No-ones crying anymore
I am closing the door
I am nothing but a ?
My mind is a weapon
My finger's a gun
It's time that I give you my pain

Killing everyone
Killing everything
Killing everyone
Killing everything
