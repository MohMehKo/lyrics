What a waste of life this is, every altercation I permit is
Like a quiet sigh
From a man resigned to a place that was never his
And the hours are long, even in a world where I belong
Every second stays, every minute counts against my sentence

I Fall…I had to let you go…

What I tried to accomplish died – every offer of faith I had
To fight and a dream unfolds
The moon is cold because the sun left early
And the days go by, even when my conscience just won’t try
Every week decays, every month is rotten -
I AM FORGOTTEN

I fall… I had to let you go
I fall…my mind is all I know
I fall… the table turns to dust
I fall… today, I let go of my trust

What a waste of time I am, every ounce of life is
Just dead flesh
I can’t forget, but then again you can’t let me remember
When I try to speak, every word I say comes out so bleak
I don’t want this, I don’t want you
But I DON’T WANT ANYONE
I don’t want anyone…

I fall… I had to let you go
I fall…my mind is all I know
I fall… the table turns to dust
I fall… today, I let go of my trust
I let go of my trust
