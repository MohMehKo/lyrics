No one's laughing now, no one's laughing now
I'm sullen and sated and you can't put a price on me
I won't share this disarray, I won't pull these hands away
I need to be chosen and my God don't pray for me

So scatter all my ashes when I'm dead
And shatter every legend in my head
If only the committed will survive
Is anybody here still left alive?

This is mine

Come no further, you go too far
I'm running 'round in circles once again
If you can't forgive me, I won't take it very hard
But I won't make it easy in the end

So scatter all my ashes when I'm dead
And shatter every legend in my head
If only the contented will survive
Is anybody here still left alive?

This is mine
This is mine
Yeah

So scatter all my ashes when I'm dead
And shatter every legend in my head
If only the committed will survive
Is anybody here still left alive?

This is mine
Mine
Mine
Mine
