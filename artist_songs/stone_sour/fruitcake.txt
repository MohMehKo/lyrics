Got a pit in so tight – wish I never had a blast that night,
I can hear’em though the walls for me
Try to run but they always find me
All in all, this is all I can take – when I fell it was my first mistake, but
Broken-hearted must've wilted, cause everything’s all tilted

I keep a little place in the back of my mind
I take a little trip when they use up my line
But as soon as I can, I’ll find another reason again

Hang around like a head on a leash – keep it all just a little out of arms reach
I can hear’em through the walls for me
Try to run but they always find me
Now I know why I can’t go in – all the blurs have a different set of keys again, but
Broken-hearted must've wilted cause everything’s all tiled

I keep a little place in the back of my mind
I take a little trip when they use up my line
But as soon as I can, I’ll find another reason again

Oh yeah, keep a little place in the back of my mind
Take a little trip when they use up my line
But as soon as I can, I’ll find another reason again

Oh you don’t wanna hurt me
You Don’t Wanna Hurt Me
YOU DON’T WANNA HURT ME ANYMORE
Bring it on, one more time…

[Solo – Jim]

I’m the one with the skeleton face – I’m the one with the full nine disgrace
I can hear’em through the walls for me
Try to run but they always find me
I never wanted it to end this way – I wish I had a little more to say, but
Broken-hearted must've wilted cause everything’s all tiled…

I keep a little place in the back of my mind
I take a little trip when they use up my line
But as soon as I can, I’ll find another reason again

Oh yeah, keep a little place in the back of my mind
Take a little trip when they use up my line
But as soon as I can, I’ll find another reason again

Oh you don’t wanna hurt me
You Don’t Wanna Hurt Me
YOU DON’T WANNA HURT ME ANYMORE
Bring it on, one more time…
Take it away, oh take it away…again…
