I know I have peculiar ways
I know I seem to hard to master
Give me more then I can take
I know the way, as long as I'm going alone

No one takes my breath away like you
And I will never change, I know my strength but...
I can not get you off my mind!
And under darkness you still shine
But what more the words can see
And lies reveal when shadows fade
And I won't let you be alone
Stay!

Burn away the past mistakes
Take a chance on my surrender
All I want is your release
I know the way, as long as I'm going alone

No one takes my breath away like you
And I will never change, I know my strength but...
I can not get you off my mind!
And under darkness you still shine
But what more the words can see
And lies reveal when shadows fade
And I won't let you be alone
Stay!

Huh!

What?

Hey!

I can not get you off my mind
When under darkness, you still shine
But what more the words can see
Your lies reveal when shadows fade
And I won't let you be alone
Stay!

Hey yeah!
Hey yeah!
Shadowing!
Shadowing!
