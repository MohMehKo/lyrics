I hear my poisons in the multitude
Why was I damned a human deemed too rude
Somewhere between the madness and my mind
I live with legions called the human kind

I wander aimlessly amongst the herd
Infesting shadows, I am undeterred
I give opinion cuz you give no peace
They say we manifest THE NEW DISEASE

My head EXPLODES
My soul BERATES
Erratic Bonds, They scar my face
I won't- EXIST
I won't- PERSIST

I cast a weary gaze into the crowd
Ten thousand reasons dropped into my mouth
My theoretix can't begin to live
So I have nothing more than LIFE TO GIVE

[chorus]

See the lies you've given me
This is not what I should be
You say your truth isn't mine
Everything, everything, everything you say's a lie

[chorus]
