My body's broken, no words spoken
Am I finally at the end?
This conflagration is my contagion
Holds me down
Yet again

Maybe life is nothing more
Than a curse inside the blessed
I will fight this bloody war with every strangled breath

I'm on my own
I'm on my own

I don't need a conscience
I don't need to feel
I don't need these weary eyes
Tell me what I know is real

I don't need anybody to tell me who I am
Blame it on the broken heart
I'm falling apart again
