I remember now, but I still have my doubts 
I think it's gonna be today 
Everybody came, but it's just not the same 
Why did it have to be today? 
Now my chest is tight - no, I am not all right 
It doesn't have to be this way 
Why does it have to be this way? 

I DONT KNOW WHAT'S WRONG, 
IT'S LIKE I'M TOO FAR GONE 
IT DOESN'T MATTER, ANYWAY 
FEAR IS IN MY HEART - JUST WHEN I STOP IT STARTS 
AND I CAN NEVER LIVE THIS WAY 

Freedom in a cage - no sun and too much rage 
I don't know how much I can take 
Push it down inside, but it knows just where I hide 
I know that "normal" is hard to fake 
Bleeding into life - it's like a thousand knives 
Are slowly turning me to this 
Why does it have to be like this? 

I DONT KNOW WHAT'S WRONG, 
IT'S LIKE I'M TOO FAR GONE 
IT DOESN'T MATTER, ANYWAY 
FEAR IS IN MY HEART - JUST WHEN I STOP IT STARTS 
AND I CAN NEVER LIVE THIS WAY

I DONT KNOW WHAT'S WRONG, 
IT'S LIKE I'M TOO FAR GONE 
IT DOESN'T MATTER, ANYWAY 
FEAR IS IN MY HEART - JUST WHEN I STOP IT STARTS 
AND I CAN NEVER LIVE THIS WAY

I lost again, today... 

I DONT KNOW WHAT'S WRONG, 
IT'S LIKE I'M TOO FAR GONE 
IT DOESN'T MATTER, ANYWAY 
FEAR IS IN MY HEART - JUST WHEN I STOP IT STARTS 
AND I CAN NEVER LIVE THIS WAY 
LIVING WITH A CURSE, SOMETIMES IT'S EVEN WORSE 
IT SLOWLY KILLS ME EVERYDAY 
SOMETHING I DESPISE IS GONNA TAKE MY LIFE 
I GUESS I'LL TRY AGAIN TODAY
