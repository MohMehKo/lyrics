Until the pages of this book are filled with emptiness
I'm still suspended by a thread
Expecting nothing less
I feel my kindred little ways
I know how my story ends

Like me...
It's not your gift to choose
I know you're going to lose
Like me...
This futile circumstance
You never had a chance
Like me...

I'm here, walking in a city that is red again
I'm here, living with the dead again
Knowing why I'm here again

Like me...
Oh, it's not your gift to choose
I know you're going to lose
Like me...
Oh, this futile circumstance
You never had a chance
Like me...

Like me...
Like me...
Like me...

I can't stay here forever
The hell is, I just can't remember
I see myself in desperation
The cyanide of realization

I fall...
I fall...

Like me...
Oh, it's not your gift to choose
I know you're going to lose
Like me...
Oh, this futile circumstance
You never had a chance
Like me...
