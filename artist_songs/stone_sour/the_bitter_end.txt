Black line run against the center of another dying sun
A situation where the Lie's behind the Truth
Come together and deny the fucking proof

I'm ready to Surrender - Surrender - Remember - Forever is
Over now

If I can't stop you, I'll never get to start again
If I don't watch you, I'll never see the bitter end

Nail my soul to the middle of a cross that fills this hole
I never understood the Written Word
Don't forget that I'm not aware of what you heard

I'm ready to Surrender - Surrender - Remember - Forever is
Over now

If I can't stop you, I'll never get to start again
If I don't watch you, I'll never see the bitter end

Hold it high... show the sky your destiny
Close your eyes... and burn away your hate
Hold it high... we can feel our prayers as we
Close our eyes... we can take the world away

Forever is over now
Forever is over now
Forever is over now

If I can't stop you, I'll never get to start again
If I don't watch you, I'll never see the bitter end

Hold it high... show the sky your destiny
Close your eyes... and burn away your hate
Hold it high... we can feel our prayers as we
Close our eyes... we can take the world away
