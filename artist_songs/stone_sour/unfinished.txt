While my hands are tied behind my back - you save the best and put me last
I've given up on giving you my heart
I fuckin' hate it - I waited - Think about the times we faked it
And realize that we tore this place apart

But there's no... reply from you
No matter what I do, I'll never get away from you
We're unfinished!

With my fingers crossed behind my back - I let your words slip through my cracks
This person you perceived is dead and gone
I fuckin' hate it - you're jaded - We can scream for the hell we created
But this time I won't let you get me wrong

'Cause there's no... reply from you
No matter what I do, I'll never get away from you
There's just no... reply from you
No matter what I do, I'll never get away from you

Oh, you wanna hurt me before I go - you wanna break me down
But you'll never hear me - you'll never feel the way I feel
We're unfinished here!

'Cause there's no... reply from you
No matter what I do, I'll never get away from you
There's just no... reply from you
No matter what I do, I'll never get away from you
