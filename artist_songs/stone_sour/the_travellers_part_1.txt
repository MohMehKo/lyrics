I think I'm happy
Mostly happy
On a green autumn day

I'm walking lazy
Barely moving
Settle out and fade away

Seems a life is something more
Than a journey with no end
I just wanna lose it all
And find myself again

I'm on my own
I'm on my own

I don't need a conscience
To tell me how I feel
I don't need these weary eyes
To focus on what to conceal

I don't need anybody
To tell me who I am
Blame it on a broken heart
I'm falling apart again
