Haha, yeah

We cast a long shadow, sucking all the cold beneath
But there's a reason a killer is a lover with a knife in its teeth
We can settle in the dust and cave
Raise your hands if you want to be saved
In the middle is the bottom of me
A Taipei person drinking Allah Tea, go!

We live, we die, we never wonder why
It's not too late to fight the hands of fate

Well you can only scream your heart over and over for so long
Before you know it, you're gonna lose your fucking mind
So don't love, don't hate- everybody's dying baby I feel great
I'm running out of road but I'm still doing 75

Mellow traumatic, ooh, looking like a Ponzi scheme
You're so sentimental, all the weight of the worlds you've created are weak
I am the voice of a rude generation
A middle finger for the middle class invasion
At the bottom is the only real me
A Taipei person drinking Allah Tea, go!

We want, we need, we punish just to bleed
We know this plea we bite the hand that feeds

Well you can only scream your heart over and over for so long
Before you know it, you're gonna lose your fucking mind
So don't love, don't hate- everybody's dying baby I feel great
I'm running out of road but I'm still doing seventy...

Force the pass, divorce the castration
Another panic in a major population
Run the course, the coarseness of a bastard
We're in the eyes of a beautiful disaster
Go!

We live, we die, we never wonder why
It's up to me to bite the hands that feed
We want, we need, we punish just to bleed
We scream this plea, type A personality

Well you can only scream your heart over and over for so long
Before you know it, you're gonna lose your fucking mind
So don't love, don't hate- everybody's dying baby I feel great
I'm running out of road but I'm still doing 75

Still doing 75
Yeah!
Still doing 75
Yeah!
Still doing 75

Hahaha, I don't know how you do it, dude
