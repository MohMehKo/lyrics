I've seen it all and I know better - 
I've felt the bitterness and pain
My soul keeps changing like the weather - 
the only constant is the rain
I've known your black and white intentions and there's no room
For shades of gray
I never asked you to conform to me...
I only begged for you to stay

I waited here tonight for you to come
But your love just disappeared
I'm waiting in the dark for miracles
But miracles don't happen here
Miracles don't happen here
Miracles don't happen here

I still have dreams that we're together
And I can still taste your skin
Reminders all around surrounded by your light - 
I don't want to die again
I don't deserve to be discovered - 
I don't deserve to know you care
I only want my promised other... not someone who isn't there

I waited here tonight for you to come
But your love just disappeared
I'm waiting in the dark for miracles
But miracles don't happen here
Miracles don't happen here
Miracles don't happen here

Oh, I waited here all night for you to come
But your love just disappeared
I'm waiting in the dark for miracles
But miracles don't happen here
I waited here all night for you to come
But your love just disappeared
I'm waiting in the dark for miracles
But miracles don't happen here
Miracles don't happen here
Miracles don't happen here
Miracles don't happen here...
