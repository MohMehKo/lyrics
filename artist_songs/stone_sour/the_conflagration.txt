Every now and then a lifetime needs a second chance to find another one, like you
Don’t forget your better reason - all your silly risks will bring you down
Several years of bitter Mondays take a heavy toll, then you realize… it’s you
Until you make this easy harder, no one else will care if you’re around

If you live your life with no tomorrows
Every day is just a road to sorrow
You should know - what they want they get it
If it’s you, they won’t let you forget it

Oh, so much for gentle lions gathering the sheep
All I wanted was something safe
Show me your ungrateful tyrants
I’ll point out the mirror points at you
This is where forever gets us…
Immoral wishes and oblivion, I can’t stay
I don’t need The Conflagration, 
I don’t need the hate, and I don’t need you

But if you live your life with no tomorrows
Every day is just a road to sorrow 
And you should know - what they want they get it
If it’s you, they won’t let you forget it

So if you live your life with no tomorrows
Every day is just a road to sorrow
You should know - what they want they get it
And if it’s you, they won’t let you forget it

I’m on my own… I’m on my own…
