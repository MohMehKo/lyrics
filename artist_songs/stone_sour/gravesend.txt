Pulling the cold on top, waiting for light and sound to stop
Deeper and deeper today, further and further I fade away
Let me ignore the cause. Special effects for common laws
I'm ready for numb... I'm ready for numb...
What have I become?
If the demons take me, I just want to be damned for good
When the spirit makes me, I will die like a good man should

I was only 18 when I finally let go
Picking at the dead like a raven on the road
I will never understand if I never get told
Living in the dark like a raven on the road

Digging with pale white hands, keeping the calm and tasting sand
Doing a favor today. Telling a friend to stay away
I can afford the cost. I don't care for what I've lost
I'm ready for numb... I'm ready for numb...
When do I become?
If the angels take me, they're going to need extra time
When the spirit mocks me, I'll know I only took what's mine

I was only 25 when I finally went home
Looking for a ride like a murder on the road
I will only understand when you leave me alone
Dying in the dark like a murder on the road
Like a murder on the road
You're never too young to remember you're old
Looking for a deal like the devil on the road
I will only understand when I finally get told
Waiting for the dark like the devil on the road
Like the devil on the road
Like the devil on the road
Like the devil on the road
