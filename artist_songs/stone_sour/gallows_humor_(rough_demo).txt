I don't wanna change the subject
But it's all that I can do
I think you will agree there is more of us
Than the sum of all of you

Let me get a read on the moment
So I can tell you what I see
I set my sights on something more
But I settle for less than me

Oh! Oh! Oh!
Feed me lies again, my soul
I don't wanna come back here anymore

Running on the last excuses
Of a world that knows my name
How am I supposed to make my mark
If I still can't make my way?

I focus on the next illusion
Someone else is in my place
There is just so much that you can take
But I [?] on my face

Oh! Oh! Oh!
Feed me lies again, my soul
I don't wanna come back here anymore

Oh! Oh! Oh!
Stay right here and leave me alone
I don't wanna come back here anymore

Anymore!
Oh ya!

I don't wanna be a burden
But I know the chance I had
Everybody wants what they don't need
And the envy drives you mad

So turn around and keep on walking
I can find my way from here
I set my sights on an epitaph
And I settle for all my fears

Oh! Oh! Oh!
Feed me lies again, my soul
I don't wanna come back here anymore

Oh! Oh! Oh!
Stay right here, leave me alone
I don't wanna come back here anymore

Oh! Oh! Oh!
Feed me lies again, my soul
I don't wanna come back here
I don't wanna come back here anymore
