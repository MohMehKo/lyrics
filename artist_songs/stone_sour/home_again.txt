You might have changed but all I can see is how you're the same
Behind that face are beautiful things and terrible ways
Remember - I remember - we were everything and nothing together
But I can't stay... and I can't get away

Can anybody hear me? Can anybody live like this?
Can anybody hear me?
Can anybody love someone but pretend that they don't exist?
I can't be wrong again
I never agreed to see this to the end
I can't go home again
And if I'm wrong then I know that I'm home again

Too much to lose - I'm choosing to learn and learning to choose
We find our faith according to lies, according to clues
Remember - I remember - we were gonna burn the world together
But I can't stay - and I can't get away

Can anybody hear me? Can anybody live like this?
Can anybody hear me?
Can anybody love someone
When they know that they don't exist?
I can't be wrong again
I never agreed to see this to the end
I can't go home again
And if I'm wrong then I know that I'm home again

Oh, I can't be wrong again
I never agreed to see this to the end
Oh, I can't go home again
And if I'm wrong then I know that I'm home again
Then I know that I'm home again
Then I know that I'm home again
