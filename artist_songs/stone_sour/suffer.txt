You won’t admit it, but it’s true – I’m happy without you
I turned away and let your drama pull you in
You always said I was a fool, but something carried through
I never wanna see your face again

So many problems left behind… I’m sorting out my mind
This Idiot has turned into a better man
I found my soul in someone else, who doesn’t feel like hell
Who doesn’t wanna make me kill myself

No! No! I have every right to hate you
No! No! I have every right to hate you

I was leaving, stop believing, then I end up right back in your arms
Now I’m bleeding, fucking seething – I was through with you long time ago

Some people suffer for no reason, but they’re the ones to blame
So walk away, let it go and save yourself
Before you tell yourself a lie, just tell that one goodbye
How much more can you take before you fucking die?

No! No! I have every right to hate you
No! No! I have every right to hate you

I was leaving, stop believing, then I end up right back in your arms
Now I’m bleeding, fucking seething – I was through with you a long time ago

No! No! I have every right to hate you

Now I’m bleeding, fucking seething – I was through with you a long time ago 

Suffer…[x4]
