Born and raised in this place called life
I got a serious case of the clap
Dirty fingernails killin' and stealin'
I'm a bonified psycho and I'm ready to snap

Take a demon seed
Smoke a lotta weed
You can't stop me
Oh, hell no
It's greasy style
And my shit for miles
Come and get me
Yeah, come on and get me, man

Yeah yeah, oh yeah, hell yeah
Road hog
Yeah yeah, oh yeah, hell yeah
Road hog

On the highway, I am thick as shit
It's just the seat is really killin' my 'roids
Motorcycles and a fifth of the beam
I'm a double cammy shammy with a need to destroy, yeah

Super holy shit
Lose the acid tits
You can't stop me
Oh, hell no
There, you missed a cue
Have a turkey
Yeah, come on and get me, man

Yeah yeah, oh yeah, hell yeah
Road hog
Yeah yeah, oh yeah, hell yeah
Road hog

[?]
I never said anything
Don't make it fucking killing me
My boots are hard
Lookin' through the stars
Really munchy
Go, can't face the munchyness

Yeah yeah, oh yeah, hell yeah
Road hog
Yeah yeah, oh yeah, hell yeah
Road hog

Too much on my face
Skeeters in my teeth
Fuck it, oh shit
And we're almost done
Ain't this shit been fun?
See you later
Yeah, y'all come back now

Road hog, baby
Chicken fried, double cheese
Put everything on it
