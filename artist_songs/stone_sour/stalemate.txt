If I fail, if I fall...
If I can't be free, then I never was at all
The more I fight, I stay the same...

Where do I go, and what do I do?
I'll never know if I never get through
The more I fight, I stay... THE SAME!

God, I love excuses
Nothing better than a homemade lie
New rules and old confusion
The ones you just despise

Out of my way, out of my reach
How do you dream if you still can't sleep?
My mind is a terrible gift
And I'd rather be numb than feel this way

Come home with the medal is broken
Another fake doesn't matter a thing
Time flies when the moment is golden
I wont leave this clean

If I fail, if I fall...
If I can't be free, then I never was at all
The more I fight, I stay the same...

Where do I go, and what do I do?
I'll never know if I never get through
The more I fight, I stay the same...

Half my time I want protection
This is better than a bigger stand
New shoes and old directions
The epithet of man

Killing my name, killing my past
Nothing's left when nothing lasts
My life is a terrible waste
And I'm going down fast

But if I fail, if I fall...
If I can't be free, then I never was at all
The more I fight, I stay the same...

Where do I go, and what do I do?
I'll never know if I never get through
The more I fight, I stay the same...

[Solo]

Oh, don't be so distracted
I can tell you where the story ends...
New sins and old abuses
And no one wins again...

This is my chance, this is my curse
We all know it'll only get worse
My hell is a terrible case
But I'll give you all hell first!

If I fail, if I fall...
If I can't be free, then I never was at all
The more I fight, I stay the same...

If I still, if I stall
If I can't be heard, I will never even call
The more I fight, I stay the same

Where do I go, and what do I do?
The very thought scares the hell out of you
The more I fight, I stay the same...

If I fail, if I fall...
If I know if I care at all
The more I fight, I stay the same...
