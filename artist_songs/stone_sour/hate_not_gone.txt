I'll get by and I'll try - I gotta walk across my grave
And I'll die - I'll die - spit a grin... right in my face
I'll fight - I'll fight - my eyes refuse your gods
I can't lie, so I'll lie - your change of heart is all for show
Your lack of self-control is all you know
It's over now, but you can't let it go
You can't begin to know the lives you hold
My Hell is running cold...

This hate is not gone - 
You make me want to start a war
Because you waited so long -
You don't know what you're fighting for
I know this hate is not gone -
You have no right to be here

I wanna smoke, so I'll smoke - a calm before the storm
And I'll break, cuz I'm broke - still pissed... still fucking bored
And I hope - oh, I hope - you will finally go away
I know - God, I know - your change of faith is all for show
Your lack of self-control is all you know
It's over now, but you can't let it go
You can't begin to know the lives you hold
My Hell is running cold...

This hate is not gone - 
You make me want to start a war
Because you waited so long -
You don't know what you're fighting for
I know this hate is not gone -
You have no right to be here

It's all for show
Your lack of self-control is all you know
It's over now, but you can't let it go
You can't begin to know the lives you hold
My Hell is running cold...

This hate is not gone - 
You make me want to start a war
Because you waited so long -
You don't know what you're fighting for
I know this hate is not gone -
You have no right to be here
