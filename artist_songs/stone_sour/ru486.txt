(This record is an unseen enemy of the human mind)
(You are going to relax)
(Use it regularly, Bring your mind to follow the suggestions to an unpleasant degree)
(You are going to relax)
(The mind needs nervous tension. And now we shall begin)
(Listen only to my voice)
(One word of caution)
(RU486)

The pity turns complacent
The fear gives it a rush
Nobody needs a hopeless romantic
Who never sleeps, and dreams too much
The fear is unrepentant
That means there's nowhere to hide
So draw a breath, and kill my Judas
You'll never know until you come inside!

You are defeatist
Forsaken
A jewel in the crown of the sun
Never repeated, or taken
I wouldn't change a fucking thing that you've done

(Going Down Alive)
(Going Down Alive)
Assume your nemesis!
(Going Down Alive)
(Going Down Alive)
Are you 486?

Another weak contender
Another pound of the nails
The future lies in perfect condition
You can do it if you're built to fail!
I only know solutions
I've never thought of the end
Someone else is closing the casket
Another hungry mouth to defend!

You are defeated
Forbidden
A name at the top of the list
Never related, or stricken
I wouldn't change a fucking thing about this

(Going Down Alive)
(Going Down Alive)
Assume your nemesis!
(Going Down Alive)
(Going Down Alive)
Are you 486?

(YOU!)
Projector
(WON'T!)
Suspector
(FEEL!)
The victor, it's only who is left to say
(YOU!)
Contractor
(DON'T!)
Detractor
(SEE!)
The answer! It's screaming what you'll never say!

We are demeaning!
Forever!
A world that will never exist
Always repeating, or severed!
We wouldn't change a fucking thing about this!

(Going Down Alive)
(Going Down Alive)
Assume your nemesis!
(Going Down Alive)
(Going Down Alive)
Are you 486?

(Going Down Alive)
(Going Down Alive)
Assume your nemesis!
(Going Down Alive)
(Going Down Alive)
Are you 486?!
