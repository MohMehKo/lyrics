I'd cross the sea to you
I've left myself deserted here again
I'd cross the sea to you
My pieces are too broken now to mend

In the middle
Under a cold black sky
The sun will only burn for you and I
In the moment..
Before I lose my mind
These hours don't mean anything this time..

Give me a sign
Show me the line
Maybe tonight
I'll tell you everything

Give me a sign
Show me the line
Maybe tonight
I'll tell you everything

I'd cross the world for you
My reasons have no reason to remain
I'd cross the world for you
I don't know what I'm doing wrong but I canâ€™t stay the same

In the middle
Under a clear blue sky
The sun can only burn for you and I
In the moment
Before I lose my mind
These hours don't mean anything this time..

Give me a sign
Show me the line
Maybe tonight
I'll tell you everything

Give me a sign
Show me the line
Maybe tonight
I'll tell you everything

Give me a sign
Show me the line
Maybe tonight
I'll tell you everything

Give me a sign
Show me the line
Maybe tonight
I'll tell you everything

Everything
Oh...
