Oh long ago, there was a dead rat caught in a Chinese trap
And all I had to show were the ashes of a life that had no chance
It wasn't right, but all I could do was be another number that couldn't refuse
What a lie, with nothing to lose - something happened in nineteen-eighty-two

Are you the enemy?
Let me show you what you did to me

Once I get away from here
I know it's gonna be my time
I've seen too much to keep me here
I don't want yours, I just want mine

I'm never alone... I'm always in the middle talking to myself
And all I want to know... Am I really on the road? I just can't tell
It isn't right, but all I can do is take it to a level where I can't refuse
It's a lie - I need you to see - let me show you what you did to me

Once I get away from here, I know it's gonna be my time
I've seen to much to keep me here - I don't want yours, I just want mine
Before I get away from here, I think I better set you straight
I know my place is miles from here - you'll never understand - I make my fate

Deep down there's a Devil inside
He can make you give up everything
Settle if you want to die
Or you can live for a world that must be free

Oh once I get away from here, I know it's gonna be my time
I've seen too much to keep me here - I don't want yours, I just want mine
Before I get away from here, I think I better set you straight
I know my place is miles from here - you'll never understand - I make my fate
Once I get away from here...
Once I get away from here, I know it's gonna be my time
