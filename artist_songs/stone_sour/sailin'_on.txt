You don't want me anymore,
So I'll just walk right out that door.
Played a game right from the start,
I trust you, you used me, now my heart's all torn apart.

So I'm sailin', well I'm sailin' on.
I'm movin', hey I'm movin' on.
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on.

Try to see if I'll give up,
But there wasn't any luck.
That's a fact, a fact of life.
That's the game, game of strife, everything is all in stride.

So I'm sailin', well I'm sailin' on.
I'm movin', hey I'm movin' on.
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on.

So I'm sailin', well I'm sailin' on.
I'm movin', hey I'm movin' on.
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on.

There's too many years with too many tears,
Too many days with nothin' to say.
How will we know when there's nowhere to grow?
What's the facts for life to show?
