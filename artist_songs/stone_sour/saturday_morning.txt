Telephones and broken bones that's all I need
Holding on to hold my own its holding me
There's a girl who has a girlfriend and never rants
Its Friday night and Saturday morning and here we go again

I get up, I get out I can shake, I can shout
I can laugh til I die but I can't say goodbye to you
It can't be all that bad oh, you can't go on like that

I don't know that I don't know, I'm in denial
Were in savage just
for show at least I can smile
I'm gaining weight and ground and conscience the ego mends (WHAT?)
Its Friday night and Saturday morning and here we go again

I am up, I am down - I am lost in the crowd
I can run til I die but I can't say goodbye to you
It can't be all that bad oh, you can't go on like that
Remember me when all your dreams turn back
Remember me when you can't go on like that -
CAN'T GO ON LIKE THAT

I belong, I believe I am blind when I see
I can live til I die but I can't say goodbye to you

It can't be all that bad oh, you can't go on like that

Remember me when all your dreams turn back
Remember me when you can't go on like that -
CAN'T GO ON LIKE THAT

Dooodooodoo
