I only have so long to make a safe place for you
I can twist my fingers in and build another one
Look through this face and find it
Let the hands of the Man guide it
When I put you through this...
When I put you through this you'll need me

Oh, suffer to be mine
I wanna be cruel to be kind
I'll get inside your head
Live so hard you'll wish you were dead, yeah

A touch of the WICKED

I can't help living for you, I wish I could climb inside you
Slip you on like a second skin and be another one
You'll live forever with me
You can have another soul and rape me
When I step into this...
When I step into this you'll be me

Oh, suffer to be mine
I wanna be cruel to be kind
I'll get inside your head
Live so hard you'll wish you were dead, yeah

A touch of the WICKED

You feel so tight around me- I don't wanna be the man I must be
I raise my arms and grip my head- cuz I'm seein' RED
I'll take good care of you, love
I could never ever love you enough
When I get to use this...
When I get to use this, it's OVER!!

Oh, suffer to be mine
I wanna be cruel to be kind
I'll get inside your head
Live so hard you'll wish you were dead, yeah

A touch of the WICKED

Wicked!!!
