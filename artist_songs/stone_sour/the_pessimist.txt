Half alive and stock reigning free
A hideous God of a man
You got what you want, what more do you need?
If I have to make my stand I will make you pay
I can show you the way, just stay out of my way

I / will not / become / another pessimist
I / will not / become / another reason to hide

Skin is a game, war is a prize of the flesh
I know what I want, but what do I need?
If I have to take this chance
I will take it today

I / will not / become / another pessimist
I / will not / become / another part of this

I know why, the consequence is by design
And I know why, we kill to keep our lives inside
And I know why, everything wrong just feels so right
And I know why, the way I live will never let me die

What do I have to do to make you see?
Your black of life goes grey
I don't know what I want, I don't know what I need
I have to save you too, that's the end of me

I / will not / become / another pessimist
I / will not / become / another part of this

I know why, the consequence is by design
And I know why, we kill to keep our lives inside
And I know why, everything wrong just feels so right
And I know why, the way I live will never let me die
Will never let me die
