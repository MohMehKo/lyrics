[Intro:]
Anybody
OKE
I need anybody
It's the moment ya'll been waiting for
Anybody I need
Anybody I need
End of school, we had a good run right?
Ha ha

[Verse 1:]
Listening to that Drake, I'm like oh shit!
This nigga Drizzy got me thinking bout my old bitch
You know what? Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
You got some bottles in your session, you can fuck that bitch
Jesus piece was a motherfucker,
Gotta thank God like a motherfucker
Interscope ain't promote that hoe,
But Jimmy I beast to my motherfucker
I'm back like Joe but in hefty grub
I just signed with Cash Money, yeah nigga, you know it
Spending all my motherfucker money and live like goddamn bitch
Can a motherfucker live?
Can a motherfucker live?
Can a motherfucker live?
Brand new dead, drop top Gatti
Kobin up grove, can a motherfucker live?
Flies and jet, motherfucker live
MIA buzzing like a motherfucking bee
Real nigga here, real nigga career
Body anywhere, nigga, I'm so sincere
Six bottles Ciroc, couple hoes in here
Couple old niggas from a 4-4 in here!
Nigga ain't dolo here
Got desert niggas on the niggas polo here
Bitch back back so my logo clear
It's Rich Gang! Dollar signs on the big chain
Ain't nothing new, I've been fucking with Wayne!

[Hook:]
Hanging out that window, throwing West Side up, like Pac and you know
In the club we're startin to popping off and you know
20 K, a king of diamonds, bitch, and you know
California king, hoe, just so you know
And you know,
And you know
And you know
Just so you know!

[Verse 2:]
Listening to this Big Sean like, "oh shit!"
My lil nigga Kendrick kills you on your own shit
But I fuck with Sean
It's just Compton, nigga
I helped him get his Jesus piece back from the mobsters, nigga!
I've been the middle man for rap niggas and jury niggas
Ask me find that shit like I'm motherfuckin Siri.
IPhone, ass nigga! Five homes, yes nigga!
New coupe slide back with the roof
Hunned 80 proof, gotta throw it back to proof
Air Jordan Ones, North Carolina,
I'm killing these bitches like Ray Keruf
They salute like soldiers, nigga
Give, yo game up like soldiers, nigga
Treat em like lawn chairs, throw them nigga
Still got the West Coast on my shoulders, nigga
Keep to the city, that polices is watching,
A hundred thousand on funerals
Bitches calling me Robin
Cause I'm a hood nigga, doing good, nigga!
I'm God's favorite, I wish you would nigga!

[Hook:]
Hanging out that window, throwing West Side up, like Pac and you know
In the club we're startin to popping off and you know
20 K, a king of diamonds, bitch, and you know
California king, hoe, just so you know
And you know,
And you know
And you know
Just so you know!
