[Verse 1] 
This for my nigga C-Murder, locked away 
This for the nigga conscious that took Pac away 
This For The Niggas screaming On Me But Not Today 
This for the niggas thinking' I was all Dr. Dre 
This For The Magasin Writers words with a Lot Say 
Come To My Hood It enough Good We Cocking Spray 
Keep It Gully Like we are For Rock AWAY 
Trick Gangsta Rap Like A hood 
Come through the hood with a model chick that I got from 'Ye 
And Rose Phantom Limitage Just a Block Away 
So Let the Beat Not While you bob your head, 
I switch cars Jump in the C.L., Smoother than Pete Rock 
air Max 95, flow classic like reboc 
Members O1 try Lay Me Down like Shirak 
R.i.P To All Them Niggas And All My Niggas 

[Chorus x2] 
Don't Don't End Up dead 
Nigga Don't Don't up Dead 

[Verse 2] 
One thing about me, 
always keep it real with myself 
Like Nas, I'm Ill Will with myself 
And I can feel the pain of Ms. Wallace 
I wish Chris was here, so he could see C.J. blow 
Like the paint on this Impala 
Tell Afeni to holla if she need another son that rap 
Pac's revenge And I got a gun that clap like Dr. Dre snares 
Blow chronic like Dr. Dre cares 
I been there, done that Dr. Dre shares all his bitches and his liquor 
He ain't call me for Detox, but that's my nigga 
Remember Who Brought Em Back To Compton 
And 23 year Old Me was a fuckin Monsters 
Still Niggas Say I Ain't Hood what Fuck They Taking Bout 
Like I want Kiss My Son on the Head nd Chuck em out 
What up 50? Let's talk it out
But until we talk it out 

[Chorus x2] 
Don't Don't End Up dead 
Nigga Don't Don't up Dead 

[Verse 3] 
I remember when my older brother wanted to be Rakim 
Now I'm livin' his dream, cause somebody shot him 
And left me like Eric B. without Rakim 
Still payed them for like B.B.S stock Rims 
Now I Got California locked In 
Dip in this Beamer, Same model, different year they shot Pac in 
So whats The Top 10 If You Dead 
Who Drop This Lamborghini If I'm In the feds 
To Times Feeling spelling my Nights Up In The Bed 
But I'm From Compton so When I'm Out Its Infrared 
Get My Son ready For School nd I kiss His Heads 
So When You See My Face In The Mirror 
If i End Up Dead Bed 
Never War Bullet Proof Vest and No Got Bullet Proof Car 
You Know Me Westside Triple O.G 
And I'ma tell you like the homie Snoop Dogg told me 

[Chorus x2] 
Don't Don't End Up dead 
Nigga Don't Don't up Dead
