[Chorus] 
Ferrari Lifestyle 
Tell the haters I'm sorry 
I'm passing them on the rise 
what can they say now 
Ferrari Lifestyle 
Tell the haters I'm sorry 
I'm passing them on the rise 
what can they say now 
I know, I know, I now, I know 

[Fabolous] 
Yo, I'm such a sight to see I turn a hater to a tourist 
The way I order Rose, I turn a waiter to a flourist 
Ferrari Lifestyle, that mean I'm living fast 
on the road to riches you don't slow down 
you give it gas 
25 is what they couldn't see us living past 
we was broke just once 
someone give us cash 
Obama on the wrist, presidential Rollie 
Beverly Hills coppin', I ain't Axel Foley 

I'm just a young nigga moving like a Californian 
Word to proposition 19 in California 
I go from 0-60, a couple seconds 
she go from sober to tipsy and gettin' naked 
me and Game the '010 Crockett and Tubbs 
Trey said he gon' meet us on the block of the club 
you heard Jerome, but instead of a Benzo 
get rid of your Friends-oh to ride in this Enzo 

[Chorus] 
Ferrari Lifestyle 
Tell the haters I'm sorry 
I'm passing them on the rise 
what can they say now 
Ferrari Lifestyle 
Tell the haters I'm sorry 
I'm passing them on the rise 
what can they say now 
I know, I know, I now, I know
