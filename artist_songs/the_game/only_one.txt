[Chris Brown]
All these girls around the World, they love me
I'm supposed to be the only one
It ain't my fault if all these ladies love me
Thought I was supposed to the only one
Believe that I'm a gangsta girl
All I ever wanted was a real girl
You know that I'm a gangsta girl

[Game - Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be your number one
Thought we was getting married when the summer come
Two piece Armani with the ?
And when she look in my eyes she see a money sign
She see Loiue Vuitton, she see them Prada heels
I took her outta that couch, hotter than ?
I mean its gotta feel good to a bitch about the hood
Driving a Rose Phantom with an angel on the hood
I mean we living that good
Chowing on Mr Chow's after this it's Fillippe
Nigga you know my style
Lil Cristal, Lil Rose
A whole bunch of Al's bad bitches in the place
Nigga feel like an Owl, nigga I'm so fly
Pull that Bugatti out, them haters gon die
Baby you know them doors are suicide
And it ain't about nuttin but you and I

[Game - Verse 2]
She used to stash my loot, all in the sofa
Then I used to knock her boots all in the sofa
She had 3 stocks, one chrome on that Toyota
Then she flipped channels on a nigga
Oprah, all up in the club getting hawk by the vultures
The femal Spreewell, was too hard to couch her
So I had to do the best thing for both us
Take myself shopping, get my Ralph Lauren coats up
It ain't trickin' if you got it right, No sir
Can't get a shot of Patron unless she gon fuck
Can't leave these hoes alone nigga it's so tough
Especially if they finance the nose, I pick them both up
Then we hit South beach, pull my Gucci loc's up
Hit my nigga Wayne like let me borrow some ?
Looking like a casting call and we show up
We getting Young Money but we grown up
So what!

[Chorus]
