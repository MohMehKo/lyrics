Know what the fuck be pissing me off? The other motherfuckers think they running my block. Jump off that fucking stoop, hit the fucking gate, nigga grab your burners it's time to go to war. I give the niggas a whole fucking clip every motherfucking round in this motherfucker you can get

Niggas run up on this red '64
You get a white tag on your big toe
These ain't punch lines, niggas kick doors
Leave your baby mama with her lip swole
All handguns, niggas pack light
Nigga's mouth loose but my strap tight
Niggas slide through and they bust first
We killin' everybody that night
Block wars, we bout that life
Scuffed J's and them fist fights
Dead bodies on dead bodies
Savage, that's what I live like
Go and chop a nigga head off
Fuck around, let the rounds hit you
Blood splattered on a nigga's [?]
All I had to do was give a signal
Magazines if you got an issue
Hit one nigga with the source
Hit two niggas with the vibe
Bitch I kill your vibe
It's a reason niggas can't fuck with ya
I'm a Compton nigga and I don't give a fuck
Nigga walk around with that pistol tucked
I do drive-bys out a Plenty truck

(Murder-murder)
Have you ever seen a murder?
(Murder-murder)
Boom-boom-boom, let 'em
Have you ever seen a murder?
Have you ever seen a dead body?
Got a chopper with some rounds on it
Boop-boop, hittin' everybody
Turn the corner for your mama house
Put a nigga in the trunk
Cock your shit and walk around the corner
Promise nigga this ain't what you want
Nigga ain't what you want
Nigga ain't what you want
Nigga ain't what you want
No, nigga ain't what you want
(Murder-murder)
Boop-boop-boop
(Murder-murder)

Pull up on your block, take that shit over
Stolen choppers out of stolen Rovers
Supernova bullets rippin' through Corollas
Pure shooter like DeMare DeRozan
Hot slugs but the jewelry frozen
12 gauges on the trap sofas
Naked bitches in the kitchen whippin' yola
Pockets fat like a young Oprah
Told the nigga he ain't want the clip
I'm filthy rich and still with the shit
His mama cryin' but his son a bitch
I had her view the body like she from the 6
Bullets ricochetin' all through the block
Nigga run his mouth like he knew the cops
I do the shootin' while the shooters watch
Then cook crack in a newer pot
Move me? Gotta move the block
That means take shots like it's Lou Dot
Niggas talkin' bout the game like it's ESPN
I'll put your ass with Stuart Scott
No conscious mind, the chronic got
My mind blown
I can't stop with the murder shit
Burn rubber, burn a clip
A lot of niggas died on [?] shit

Murder, murder, murder
Have you ever seen a dead body?
Have you ever seen a murder?
Have you ever seen a dead body?
Have you ever seen a murder?
Have you ever seen a dead body?
Got a chopper with some rounds on it
Boop-boop, hittin' everybody
Turn the corner for your mama house
Put a nigga in the trunk
Cock your shit and walk around the corner
Promise nigga this ain't what you want
