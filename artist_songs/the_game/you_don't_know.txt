[Verse 1:]
Tryna dive a pair, work on my back scrubber
You tryna feed me well you know how that goes
She said go easy and I stay out the back door
A nigga went Yeezy in it, north west though
Nigga wanna talk about money? Let's talk
Nigga wanna talk about guns? We'll jump
Nigga wanna run around like you set the razors on fire
You admit it all, your shit popped
Think nigga ain't know, think a nigga ain't know, think a nigga ain't know
Think nigga ain't know, think a nigga ain't know, think a nigga ain't know

[Hook:]
You don't wanna know, you don't wanna know me nigga
You don't wanna know me nigga
You don't wanna know, you don't wanna know me nigga
You don't wanna know
You don't wanna know, you don't wanna know me nigga
You don't wanna know me nigga
You don't wanna know, you don't wanna know me nigga
You don't wanna know nigga nigga

[Verse 2:]
Nigga talk about cars then I pull out the Aston
When it's Tom Ford then I pull out the plastic
Ridin with a ratchet, totin that ratchet
Murder that pussy, nigga pull out the casket
Bend on a check nigga I ain't gotta cash it
Big around my neck, nigga I ain't gotta flash it
Smoking in the white house I ain't gotta ash it
Never rolled a blunt 'cause my white boy hash it
You ain't even know, you ain't even know
I fucked yo bitch before you got yo dick
You ain't even know, you ain't even know
Million ratchets still eatin half a meal
You ain't even know, you ain't even know
Motherfucker I'm Pablo, in a all black Diablo
Rockin J's like a nigga from Chicago

[Hook:]
You don't wanna know, you don't wanna know me nigga
You don't wanna know me nigga
You don't wanna know, you don't wanna know me nigga
You don't wanna know
You don't wanna know, you don't wanna know me nigga
You don't wanna know me nigga
You don't wanna know, you don't wanna know me nigga
You don't wanna know nigga nigga
