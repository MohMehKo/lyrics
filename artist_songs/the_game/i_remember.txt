[Hook: Game (Future)]
It's been a long damn time since a nigga sold dope
But if you put a brick right in front of me, I remember
Makin' sure they in the triple beam, I remember
Blow the fully auto magazine, I remember
(I done fucked so many bitches that I can't remember names
But if you put that pussy right up in my face, I remember
Drop that pussy down on the floor, I remember
The way she coppin' down on the floor, I remember)

[Verse 1: Game]
Pop the pussy, don't play with it
I don't care if Kanye hit it, I don't care if Jay hit it
I'm a eat it up and I'm a lay with it
We shot a chopper at the gun range
Got stupid cars, got dumb change
Red bottoms, let the tongue hang
Got an off-white Porsche, cum stain
I'm whippin' work (I remember)
Roll up that purp (I remember)
Pour up that syrup (I don't remember)
(How Tunechi had that purple Slushy comin' out that blender)
Got a Keisha, got a Rhonda
Got a Nisha, got a Tanya
Met a Tishaun, met a Honda
And I eat her anaconda
Got condoms in that condo
Got kush breeded in Rondo
Still hit me up for that blow
You already know

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Drop top 'Rari shit, I drove it like I stole it
The Lambo in the shop, told my bitch to Range Rove
Microwave broke, so a nigga had to stove it
Dropped it off to my Auntie, told her hold it
I'm posted right now, posted in this Gucci link
7 dead, 30 mill, wonder what Kool G think
Quaters not half O's (I remember)
Now it's the middle of June, and it's snowing like December
If it get into the 'sacs in your hood, I could mend ya'
Ya' nigga talkin' reckless on your song, I'll revenge ya'
Pull up to the club in a Phantom, I had a vision
Break 'em all down on the hammer, end of vision

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Future]
Pop that pussy up in that hydraulics (what's that)
6 4, throw that brick inside a pot and cook it, whip it good though
Baking soda inside of her bowl, hey yo, watch me blow
Promethazine mixed with a Sprite, poor it foo'
Been sippin' syrup all night, and I get higher than a plane
Yeah I remember your pussy girl, but I don't know your name
I got diamonds hanging off, they can talk of the insane
Ever since I gave her that molly, man that girl ain't been the same
Better pop pussy for a real nigga
That's on the way, I'm a deal with ya
I'm a real boss, that real sauce
Don't try me bitch, I will floss
That's real talk, my top off, I'm throw it off
Homo that green no play golf
I hustle take no days off
(FUTURE)
