Yo whassup this is Kanye-to-the
Y'know good music is in the building

We gotta get, get started on our next joint my nigga

[Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream...
(Was it all a dream?) [2X]
(Was it all a dream?) Dream (dream) dream (dream) dream
(Was it all a dream?) ([Jay-Z:] "It was all a dream") [3X]

[Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream; I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin pictures on my wall
Every Saturday, Rap Attack - Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin weed and bamboo, sippin on private stock 
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack 
With the hat to match
(Jay-Z: "It was all a dream") Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far 
Now I'm in the {dream} cause I rhyme {dream}
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade 
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowin up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's {dream}

[The Game]
Aaliyah had a {dream} Left Eye had a {dream}

[Notorious B.I.G.]
And if you don't know, now you know
It was all a dream ([Jay-Z:] "It was all a dream") [4X]
It was all a dream
