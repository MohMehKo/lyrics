Feel like I sold my fucking soul to the devil for these palm trees and six fours

[Verse 1: Nipsey]
When you come from depression, to the lust for possessions
Gotta make an impression, but you can’t wait for your blessing
Model bitches stip naked, while I sip on this Texas
I’m pushing this German, jesus piece on my neclace

These niggas gon’ test ya, and these bitches is reckless
And that money go fast, I hope you paying yo’ taxes
All the questions they askin’, all the cameras that’s flashin’
All the stress that come with it, it’s like you hustling backwards

If you ain’t breaking the bank, so we go hard everyday
And the sacrificial lamb is just the part that you play
When you the first one in yo’ fam to have the heart to get paid
Had the smarts to switch lanes, had the guts to be brave

Now, and now you a star on the stage
And once they cut on them lights, no turning ‘em off, that’s part if the game
Wow, people caught up in your fame
And never will it be the same, this shit is expensive, the price that we pay, that’s why I..

[Verse 2: The Game]
Clip tossin’, since niggas is brick flossin’
Now the bloods wit’ Slauson so niggas go get coffins
Comptons like NFL, niggas get hit often
Heavy but I green, make niggas forget Boston
Red bone bitch, she high on blue dolphins
Head game sick, she bi and switch often
It’s kush, bitch quit coughin’, my six got streets talkin’
Timbo, this shit scorchin’, got Bloods and Crips walkin’

It’s Nip, so get up off him, we like Biggie and Jigga mayne
And Nickerson’s Marcy, Bed-Stuy is Slauson
My flow somethin’ like Nassir, I should put a pause here
...Run and tell them niggas the God’s here

This California kush got me in God’s ear
We got them Ace of Spades, but ain’t no cards here
Just a Crip, a Blood, a couple exotic cars here
And these extra long clips like Lamars here, Nip
