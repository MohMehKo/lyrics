[Intro - Diddy]
Ay yo game
Its magic baby
Open that bottle of Ciroc..light up on
And lets go, ye ye, that's right

[Verse 1 - Game]
Like a Don, walk in the club with red rum
Was goin on? my killa bees like Cappadon
Rap phenomenon, chill like two bottles of Dom
The Audemar the only thing on my arm
Keep bitches in my stable like ?
Take em to the mansion in the phantom have em wetter than ?
Nigga we never scared
Bitches get they bones crushed
Sittin on the throne, just take off your ?
Don't run from the magic stick
Just look around in the crib, you can have this shit
Yeah, big pimpin and this shit don't stop
We don't stress the tag, we just drive it off the lot
(its hot) I know that baby,
Take your coat on let me see you throw that baby
Just work that thing, I'ma hurt that thing
Like its first 48, I'm a murk that thing

[Chorus]
All in red bottom, Gucci, Louis and Prada
Girl you know your man got it
Grab yourself a red bottom (you deserve it)

She can get it, she can get it, she can get it
She can get it, she can get it, she can get it
She can get it, she can get it, she can get it
She can get it, she can get it, she can get it

Bout to poppin top now, and its gettin hot now
And I'm on Ciroc now, doin my diddy bop now
(lets go, come on, lets go, come on, lets go come on, lets go come on)
Standin on the couch now, 'bout to have a countdown
See so many bad hoes, I ain't tryna calm down
(lets go, come on, lets go, come on, lets go come on, lets go come on)

[Verse 2 - Game]
Aftermath is a army, better yet a navy
Niggaz will drink up your patron, put dick in your lady
We only drive Mercedes, and 'em hard top Masi'
The only problem ladies will rock that body
Twelve AM and I'm pourin goose
One AM now the hoes is loose
Two AM now she kissin' on her
Three AM its all Gucci... BURR
Fuckin with bad boy, coz diddy got mad toys
Dont be surprised if we hit your block in an asteroid
Star Trak gangsta, the N.E.R.D.S. are here
Weezy cant be far coz the birds are here
So get it girl, you know you gotta get it
Like your Louis Vuitton and the prada purse with it
She a boss chick, I'm tryna hit it
All you broke ass niggas don't get it

[Chorus]
All in red bottom, Gucci, Louis and Prada
Girl you know your man got it
Grab yourself a red bottom (you deserve it)

She can get it, she can get it, she can get it
She can get it, she can get it, she can get it
She can get it, she can get it, she can get it
She can get it, she can get it, she can get it

Bout to poppin top now, and its gettin hot now
And I'm on Ciroc now, doin my diddy bop now
(lets go, come on, lets go, come on, lets go come on, lets go come on)
Standin on the couch now, 'bout to have a countdown
See so many bad hoes, I aint tryna calm down
(lets go, come on, lets go, come on, lets go come on, lets go come on)
