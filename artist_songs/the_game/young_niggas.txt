Ray Ray - So what's up Lil J?
Lil J - We down Ray Ray
Ray Ray - So what set you claiming?
Lil J - Claiming Hoover and South Shores, we down with 32's in most quads, straight like that
Ray Ray - Straight like that huh?

We grew up as friends
We was 10, lil niggas on the block
He ain't have his own basketball so we shared my rock
His mama was a fiend, he ain't heard from his pops
He used to share my clothes with him all the way down to his socks
He would spend a night, that one night would turn into a week
At least until his mama got back on her feet
And she never did
So he moved in with me, my mama, and my sisters
Couldn't let him go to foster care cause she ain't trust the system
So she took care of him like he was me
Gave us everything she could back when shit was all good

Just some young niggas
We was just some young niggas
We was just some young niggas

Niggas turned 12 in '92, we was headed to the 7th grade
Running 'round, stealing cars, dreaming about the better days
Ducking strays, catching fades tryna make it through this maze
Teachers out here smoking J's and wonder why we misbehave
Same book, different page
Another year, different age
Cross colors, colors cross, bows turning into fades
He started cripping, I started blooding
Now we walking through the halls of school like we don't even know each other

Young nigga out in these streets
(Out in these streets)
We was just some young niggas
(All in these streets to feed)
Young niggas
(Lord knows I don't want no enemies yeah)
(Young niggas in the streets)

Started off as brothers but sometimes shit falls apart
How can I hate this nigga with all this love up in my heart
With this nigga mean mugging
Every time we in the class
Nigga tuck that blue rag or I'm beat your fucking ass
Guess my mind gone
Caught him after school, he ain't had no ride home
Still got that rag hanging, that's what got him fired on
He pulled the strap so I pistol whipped him with the chrome
Wasn't tryna kill him, coulda pulled the trigger
I was just a young nigga

Young nigga out in these streets
(Out in these streets)
Just a young nigga
(All in these streets to feed)
Just a young nigga
(Lord knows I don't want no enemies yeah)
I was just a young nigga
(Young niggas in the streets)

Whopped my nigga ass, he ain't take it on the chin
Rumor started to spread, guess I saw him when I see him
Two weeks pass and graduation came around
I was walking through the choir, .45 under my gown
Had to take a leak, so I headed to the bathroom
Corner of my eye, see him coming out of the class room
We exchange words so I cocked the 45th
He shot, I shot back, thank God I ain't get hit
But damn I miss my young nigga

(Out in these streets)
Just a young nigga
(All in these streets to feed)
Just a young nigga
(Lord knows I don't want no enemies yeah)
(Young niggas in the streets)

Young niggas, young niggas, young niggas
I ain't the one nigga
Down with my young niggas
