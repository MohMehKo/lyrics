Halle motherfucking lujah, all my real niggas I salute ya
All the bad bitches, I'm a run throguh ya
Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah, damn, damn, damn
Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah, damn, damn, damn
Heaven's prays, all I'm tryina do, reach you, praise you
Heaven's prays, all I'm wanna do, praise you, my lord

Nigga I ain't pastor mason yo, nigga patting rhyme, pete sirock acing y'all
And since I got good taste and all, this for all the bad bitches couldn't wait to get they braces off
I know we in church, and the way that I'm thinking, wrong
But inside the bible is the perfect way to sneak my phone
But I don't wanna do that, I came to take the service in
And stare at all the women who brought they Louie purses in
Bad bitches in here, forgive me for my sins
I ain't meant to walk inside the church cursing again
I wanna live righteous and you know I love Jesus
But you can't catch the holy ghost in the prius

They look around the church like what that nigga looking here
He prolly told of somebody, posed to be doing years
But who am I to judge a nigga, hey I don't wanna go to church, I can't budge the nigga
But I love the nigga, so I'm a go for both us, and put these g stars slacks with these louie loafers
He rather sit outside and listen to hova
But the service jumping, the pastor is serving my mimosas
And all this ass in here, how do I focus
Collection plate buldging damn pastor you the coldest
My envelope stay swollen, so I'm a count my blessings now, somebody hold this

Halle motherfucking lujah, all my real niggas I salute ya
All the bad bitches, I'm a run through ya
Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah, damn, damn, damn, damn
Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah, damn, damn, damn, damn

Staring in the row behind me, man these fat hoes is too cheap
Ain't paying they ties, taking up 2 seats
And look at God's house, pack full of sinners
With the sun ride service, now they back for the dinners
Yeah I know the chicken good but your soul ain't
And your outfit clean but your nose ain't
And I supposed ain't nobody a liar in here
If that was true, the whole chruch would be on fire in here
I'm so glad we have a choir in here, to wake me up everytime I get tired in here
And one thing's for sure, gotta praise the lord
Cause when I went to undefeated, they still have my force
Fell to the floor like
