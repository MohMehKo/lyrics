[Verse 1]
When Them Niggas Start Shooting thats When the Shots
Get the Pourin, you Only Got one Shot To Hit The Floor And
Just Take This One Shot as a Warning
Cause Tomorrow Could Be A Wake Like Good Morning
Back on the block like I never left, it's Friday
Hi Ms. Parker, I've been cooking, I'm a forever chef
And The Recipe IS Legendary
I Put Niggas Careers to End Early Like February
Then I come back Marchin
Hit you with april Showers, them Shots
Kill Niggas Like abortion
Cause No Body Care About The Nigga That Ain't There
Then Miss You until They Kiss You and You Going in The Ground
with maggots eating your tissue
Similar to the way the Shit Do
These are los Angeles Times Niggas Get Your Issue

[Chorus]
Sweet things You Do?
And set My heart Of Love
Now I Want You To Know
And remind Me,yeah yeah Oh Ohh
