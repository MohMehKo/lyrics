You are the blood flowing through my fingers
All through the soil and up in those trees

1-9-7-9 That was the year California would go blind
My Momma had a son, a fully automated Gun
11 pounds seven ounces Compton here we come
My first night in my crib
I heard somebody screaming
A Couple Gunshots, 
then some tires screeching
My father reaching, what is he grabbing?
He rolled me over in my crib, 
just to get his magnum
Is he a policeman? 
That’s what I’m thinking. He can’t be that 
Bcuz he do heroin and he be drinking
Shopping baby powder up on my momma mirror 
Mexican chicks in my kitchen cookin 
lookin like shakira
I’m in my high chair, 
They naked, this is Rated R.
Think I ain’t payin attention 
cuz u slide me a Gerber jar?
Then my momma walked in with an orange box
I couldn’t read what it said cuz she leaned over and said...

[Chorus:]
You are the Blood flowing through my fingers
And I could feel it in my heart, my mom’s said it from the start
That I would always be the reason blood flowing...
All through the soil and up in those trees

First day of kindergarten shoe strings for a belt
Moms worked the graveyard, too tired, 
so I dressed myself
Who Goes to School in a Freddy Krueger Flannel?
Black Chuck Taylors and I never liked sandals
A Lotta birthdays but we ain’t never light candles
Gang of Christmas gifts 
but I ain’t never seen Santa
So I waited up one year 
Guess who came through my garage 
My Daddy with a Toysaraus Bag 
Hit the lights! Aha!
Uh-uh I ain’t goin for that
I got presents I can see em! 
Cuz they ain’t wrapped
From a race track to a Dre track
Don’t wear overalls no more
But a nigga stay strapped!
The Rumour round my middle school 
was that I can’t rack
There wasn’t a locker in that motherfucker 
I ain’t paint black
And now I’m doin doughnuts in this maybach 
Reminiscing bout detention, teachers used to say that... 

[Chorus:]
You are the blood flowing through my fingers
And I could feel it in my heart, my mom’s said it from the start
That I would always be the reason blood flowing...
All through the soil and up in those trees
