Uh, yeah, it's that Westside shit
It's for the '99 and the 2000s, nigga
I ain't flyin' with none of you niggas
The new Cash Money
The gang that don't pay, biatch
Right

[Hook:]
I got mad flows, mad flows
The shit that got me mad whores
I get mad more, nigga
I got mad flows, mad flows
The shit that got me mad dough
I get mad more, motherfucker

Black Benzes, windows tinted, no, my shit ain't rented
Inglewood [?] fuck a nigga and his [?]
Hot boy, nigga, make a million while I'm chillin'
I could bet a pretty penny you ain't livin' what you spittin'
Go up where the thugs burnin', see the cash when I'm grinnin'
Montana shit, Medusa head stitched in my linen
Street nigga, no account, your account in my denim
Unless you blind, bitch, it ain't hard to see a nigga winnin'
If I'm talkin' to that ho, then tell that bitch to pay attention
Big business, I use dollar signs to punctuate a sentence
Fuck the law, do it raw, skip the trial and drop the witness
Bein' broke been a joke, ain't shit funny 'bout my digits?

[Hook]

Strap on, get clapped on, nigga, that just be the facts
They say "Me, I don't rap though", got [?]
Got my chopper on, my stack of Os
Then came back with the sack
Man, my Roley, that's goldie, my wrist nicknamed "The Mack"
See, your niggas ho-niggas and that shit they be [?]
Man, my niggas be killers, give a fuck about rap and beats
See, my bitches got bitches, my pimpin' game is sweet
They have you fuck 'em, then duck 'em
Man, get right back in the streets
Bitch, I've been a threat, ghetto intellect, AK and a TEC
Nigga flex, labels sendin' checks, still I'm in a set
Nigga rich, use this Internet, we ain't feel it
Play with me, I'm a play for keeps, all my niggas strapped

[Hook]

This my world now, nigga, you just livin' in it
Cause I got [?] on my face, made my vision different
By any means necessary, no, your nigga get it
He said he got it like we got it, no, you fuckin' didn't
Say, this my world now, nigga, you just livin' in it
You get some money, nigga, can I make your vision different?
By any means necessary, no, your nigga get it
He said he got it like we got it, no, you fuckin' didn't

[Hook x2]
