[Chorus:]
Running away from what was worse
Your love is burning me down
Finding a way from what was worse
Your love is burning me down

[Verse 1:]
My Momma in a Coma, I don't know how to fucking feel
But what I do know is today my life fucking real
Holding my tears inside trying not to fucking squeal
Where is Jesus when I need him to grab the fucking Wheel
They say if it's fate it's fate no ain't nothing seal
Staying strong when I really want to pop a fucking pill
Looking at my mama just laying here, fuck hospitals blood I ain't staying here
Choked up, my mama all doped up
Make me wanna have all of my enemies scoped up
But my son just walked in and wanna see his grandma
But I can't let him see you like this, Damn Ma
What the fuck we doing? What the Fuck we Doing?
Something happen to you my whole fucking life is ruined
Let the lord take me from my fucking Mamma, I'm a Kill myself
Break in heaven then it's going to be drama

[Chorus:]
Running away from what was worse
Your love is burning me down
Finding a way from what was worse
Your love is burning me down

[Verse 2:]
I don't never wanna know how Kanye feel
But right now I wouldn't feelin how I can't feel
Fuck being Game, fuck being rich
Anybody that ever owed me money, I feel like Money Makin Mitch
I can't make dinner but I can make a fuckin ditch
My pops said don't even check on er, you a fuckin bitch
Head of the Compton right now, I'm a see you there
Matter fact it's better off, I'll just leave you there
And let you rot nigga, til you in the box nigga
From now all this thug life, I'm positive I'm pop nigga
We can have it on the world for what could be
I'm out here, get any nigga try to shoot me
Who grew up in Compton? Who was born in Inglewood? Me
Two days left on death row is where I should be
But I'm right here waiting for her to wake up
Like please don't die, mama wake up

[Chorus:]
Running away from what was worse
Your love is burning me down
Finding a way from what was worse
Your love is burning me down
