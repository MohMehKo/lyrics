[The Game]
You niggaz always talkin shit, you gonna do this you gonna do that
Nigga you ain't gonna do nothin but be a motherfuckin fam when you see me
Nigga suck my dick

[Chorus]
All I need in this world is my bitch, my bitch
My glock nine, my fo five
My shotgun, I'll kill you nigga

All I need in this world is my bitch, my bitch
My glock nine, my fo five
My shotgun, I'll kill you nigga

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you a story bout these punk rap niggaz
Play tough but they whole fuckin life made up
I'm start wit 50 cuz I used to roll wit him
He never smoked weed so how could I blow wit him
Should knew he was a fag by the way his clothes fit him
Tight G-Unit jeans brought out the ho in him
Had one lil girlfriend and that was fixed
Somebody must told Vivica her boyfriend like dick
Lloyd Banks knew, he told me that shit
I told Buck and Buck told me he's ridin wit his clique
So I start ridin wit Fat Joe and Kiss
Made a good choice cuz after that Yayo bricked
So I gave away my chain and decided to keep movin
Now I'd rather burn in hell then yell G-Unit
Thats the truth nigga word to Seagle
Sleep on The Game and wake up to a gold desert eagle

[Chorus]
All I need in this world is my bitch, my bitch
My glock nine, my fo five
My shotgun, I'll kill you nigga

All I need in this world is my bitch, my bitch
My glock nine, my fo five
My shotgun, I'll kill you nigga

[Verse 2]
50 what happened to ya movie, the soundtracks
Chicken Little killed you niggaz you'll never bounce back
I paid 19 dollars to see that shit
My bitch said you was naked I ain't see that shit
You and Olivia in the shower, my bad that was Terrence Howard
A lil Hustle & Flow and a damn coward
I had to sit there for 80 minutes
The best actor in the movie was the baby in it
This ain't New Jack City and it can't be Menace
The worst actor in the world, you made the Guinness
I made G-Unot and that made you finished
I put two quarters in and I played you niggaz
Fuck Mobb Deep the lil thugs turned sissy
And Mase traded holy water for some Formula 50
Fuck Mobb Deep the lil thugs turned sissy
And Mase traded holy water for some Formula 50
Fuck Mobb Deep the lil thugs turned sissy
And Mase traded holy water for some Formula 50
Y'all niggaz come get me, I got a glock nine
I'm a window shoppa cuz I ain't got drop a dime
