You see these white people vote for Trump but they don't give a fuck about OJ
I watch the nigga whole TV show and still don't give a fuck about OJ
And don't go out like OJ
Beat a murder, went to jail for some football cards, I can't go out like OJ

White Bronco through the city like El Chapo
I get my dick sucked as I pulled up in Del Taco
It's the coach, you the presence of the ghost
Nigga say he can outrap me? I DOC his throat, fuck him
Guns, I tuck 'em, bitches I bust 'em
My niggas kidnap kids like Ciara and Russell, uh
That ain't no future for me, now come and touch mine
Your whole family tree'll get flatlined
Face off, twin Desert Eagles crack spines
I ain't joking so keep playing on the batline
This ain't Gotham, this is Compton nigga
We mix Red Bulls with vodka nigga
We blow chronic and sleep with monsters nigga
Try to be conscious, get left unconscious nigga
And we got rocket launchers nigga
Ain't never been to Iraq, the government sponsor niggas

You see these white people vote for Trump but they don't give a fuck about OJ
I watch the nigga whole TV show and still don't give a fuck about OJ
And don't go out like OJ
Beat a murder, went to jail for some football cards, I can't go out like OJ
