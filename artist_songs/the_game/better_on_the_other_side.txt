[Diddy talking]
I remember the first time I seen you moonwalk,
I believed I could do anything,
you made the world dance,
you made the music come to life

[Chris Brown - Chorus]
This the type of song that make the angels cry,
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?
why you had to go, go
I know it's better on the other side,
you were chosen from the start
never gonna let you go from my heart

[The Game]
Who’s Michael Jackson?
You're Michael Jackson,
I’m Michael Jackson,
We all Michael Jackson,
I guess what I’m asking is, everybody bow their head for a legend, don’t breathe for a second,
now let the air out, grab the hand of somebody you care about,
so you can hear my message, my confession, someone tell Usher,
I seen the moonwalk, I guess the young thriller touched him,
like he touched me, like he touched you,
so carry on his legacy, something I must do,
and I trust you lighting candles, concrete visuals,
me and my brothers listen to Jackson 5 in the living room,
first thing I did when I heard was call puff,
cos him and Mike tried to stop the beef between us,
who was us? Me and fifty, that beef is dead, him and Mike Jackson gonna take us to the ledge.

[Chris Brown - Chorus]
This the type of song that make the angels cry,
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?
why you had to go, go
I know it's better on the other side,
you were chosen from the start
never gonna let you go from my heart

As I’m pouring out this liquor candles start to flicker,
when list my air ones, MJ was my nigga.
Not the one that play ball, the one with the hollywood star,
and since I’m a Hollywood star Imma tell you my story,
never had a family that close, never see Berry Gordy walking through Interscope,
but just like me, they always had Mike in a scope,
no matter what you say,
I’mma love him and he’s still dope,
let me take you back to '85 when I was in a zone,
dancing for my momma, 'Thriller' jacket with all the zippers on,
now I’m doing 90 bout to crash in this Aston,
listening to Outcast, I’m sorry Mrs Jackson
anything I can ever do to better you your son was our king so we wont Corretta you,
I’m writing this letter to all the Jackson kids, we all Jackson kids, time to let us through.

[Chris Brown - Chorus]
This the type of song that make the angels cry,
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?
why you had to go, go
I know it's better on the other side,
you were chosen from the start
never gonna let you go from my heart

[Diddy Talking]
People can say what they want to say about you.
We gonna remember the miracles that you showed us
Through your music through your dance
Through your philanthropy.
You were the one who made us all realize that we are the world.
You were the one who showed us we could moonwalk.
You gave us the beat.
You gave us the rhythm
You gave us the soul
Through us your legacy lives on
We can't stop now
We won't stop now MIKE JACKSON

[Chris Brown - Chorus]
This the type of song that make the angels cry,
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?
why you had to go, go
I know it's better on the other side,
you were chosen from the start
never gonna let you go from my heart

[Boys II Men]
This the kind of song that make the angels cry,
look up in the sky and ask God, why o why why
Do we live and let die
This the kind of song that make the angels cry,
look up in the sky and ask God, why o why why
Do we live and let, live and let die.
