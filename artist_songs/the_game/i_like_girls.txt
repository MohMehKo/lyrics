[Chorus - Tyga]
My birthday girls, big booty girls
I like girls, that like other girls
I like girls, that like other girls
I like girls and they all like me
she dancin' on her, she dancin' on me
It feels so good, I'll buy another drink
cuz I like girls that like other girls
I like girls and they all like me

[Game]
I like girls that wear shoes with the red bottom
dont stop walkin' in 'em, haters still talkin' 'bout 'em
I like girls, other girls call her bitch
cause she always poppin' tags
and her shoes match the bag
and the bag match the whip
same color as the lips
and the paint got a gloss
like the chap stick
and the chapstick sticky just like the mary jane
its the last one to Paris
Puff we can run a train
cuz I wake up with sex on a plane
sippin' sex on a beach, havin' sex on a plane
Game, she callin' my name
but I dont know her
nigga I dont know 1st
nigga I'm from California all I know is birds
have you ever rolled down in freeways? no chauffeur
just Libras, Capricorns and Leos
girls they like me-o
girls they like me OH!

[Chorus - Tyga]
My birthday girls, big booty girls
I like girls, that like other girls
I like girls, that like other girls
I like girls and they all like me
she dancin' on her, she dancin' on me
It feels so good, I'll buy another drink
cuz I like girls that like other girls
I like girls and they all like me

[Red Cafe]
Girls, girls love me
it'd be 3 of them and just me
6 more for Game and Puffy
I'm a boss so I fuck for free
yea everywhere I goes topless hoes be
and all my girls like girls like Rosie
uh, birthday suit they gettin posey
and I dont claim nobody they all chose me
call 911 she lost her Capris
I made her cum fast like we ordered Japanese
My tight girl got a Louie Vuitton fettish
I hit her back and forth with Game, we playin' tennis

[Chorus - Tyga]
My birthday girls, big booty girls
I like girls, that like other girls
I like girls, that like other girls
I like girls and they all like me
she dancin' on her, she dancin' on me
It feels so good, I'll buy another drink
cuz I like girls that like other girls
I like girls and they all like me

[Tyga]
Its funny when bitches be runnin' around actin' silly
now they wanna show me titty, cuz I'm partying with Diddy now
money aint a thing you could ask my nigga Game
LA still the same but these hoes, done change
champagne bottles in both hands
Rose dont spill the whole thang
girls swallow, blow like Chicago
nigga get mad, uh, gun, throat, hollow
dummy, aint nothin' young but the money
got plenty girls you could take some from me
Ice in the bucket, keep the drinks comin'
all the girls love me love me
they love me, especially...

[Chorus - Tyga]
My birthday girls, big booty girls
I like girls, that like other girls
I like girls, that like other girls
I like girls and they all like me
she dancin' on her, she dancin' on me
It feels so good, I'll buy another drink
cuz I like girls that like other girls
I like girls and they all like me
