[Intro:]
We gonna let this motherfücker breathe for a minute
It's still aftermath, it's still aftermath, yea
Now when I said we gon let this motherfücker breathe
I meant this motherfücking beat is dead
We gonna preform CPR to bring that motherfücker back to life
Now let that motherfücker breathe

[Hook:]
Compton's my city
That motherfücker ain't never pretty
Gave Pac life then motherfückers that killed Biggie
Then motherfückers that killed Biggie
Get motherfückers that killed Biggie

[The Game:]
Notoriouses, bring that Benz in
I'm about a dollar, nigga fück 50 Cent
I heard Tony Yayo can't pay the rent
I heard Lloyd Banks can't pay the rent
I beat the G-Unit out of 40 Glocc
Sue me for forty grand, that same forty will get you shot
IPhone in my hand doing the forty whop
That nigga looked up and thought he saw 40 Pacs
Looking out of my window I see forty cops
Trying to serve me that subpoena, I'm on this Xbox
2 Chainz voice, smoking that Wiz Khalifa
Somebody pass to Waka Flocka, let me spit this ether
Yeah yeah yeah, till it blow the speaker
From eating Reese's Pieces to pulling guns out
For that Little Caesar's Pizza
All the way to jacking niggas for their Jesus Pieces
I'm God to you bítch ass niggas
Put that on Matthew, Paul and Peter

[Hook:]
Compton's my city
That motherfücker ain't never pretty
Gave Pac life then motherfückers that killed Biggie
Then motherfückers that killed Biggie
Get motherfückers that killed Biggie

Compton's my city
That motherfücker ain't never pretty
Gave Pac life then motherfückers that killed Biggie
Then motherfückers that killed Biggie
Get motherfückers that killed Biggie

[The Game:]
Fück with me, fück with me
Fück with me, nigga you stuck with me
Forever and ever and ever
Shyne Po ain't rich, Shyne Po
All the way in Belize with Kendrick's dick in his throat
Good kid, mad city, mad kid, bad city
Nothing from Compton could ever be trash
You hear that nigga voice sound like a dick in his ass
He reminiscing of Compton niggas bítch in prison
Used to be Christian, now that nigga Jew
Can't step foot in America so what he gone do
P. Diddy's stuntman, Jackie Chan your ass through
Hood pass revoked, get your fücking brains blew
Blood on that yarmulke, now you really Piru
Soon as they killed Biggie that man became you
But you couldn't become him
Cause you were shooting at the roof

[Hook:]
Compton's my city
That motherfücker ain't never pretty
Gave Pac life then motherfückers that killed Biggie
Then motherfückers that killed Biggie
Get motherfückers that killed Biggie

Compton's my city
That motherfücker ain't never pretty
Gave Pac life then motherfückers that killed Biggie
Then motherfückers that killed Biggie
Get motherfückers that killed Biggie

[Outro:]
I always wondered why Puff wasn't in that truck
I said, I always wondered why Puff wasn't in that truck
Let that beat breathe, let that bítch breathe
This my motherfücking city
Five motherfücking albums
The documentary, classic
Doctor's Advocate, classic
Everything in between that shit
And Jesus Piece, classic
