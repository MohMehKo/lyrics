Man I get so high can you imagine how fast the weed go
Take two puffs and pass pull out another sack so we can roll that

[Game]
Purple haze or that chocltai
Switchin lanes with my knee cause I'm rollin while I drive
And I be blowin that sticky green out the S5
That california kush increase these bitches sex drive
I know that so I be rollin up the best la
When I open my sack niggas can smell it down in bedstay
In LA niggas say my shit is that good
In new york niggas be rollin up them backwoods
Niggas try to rob me for miles to see me roll up chronic
I take the 'belve with the goose and mix it up with the tonic
I cant see her through the smoke but I can tell that she want it
Take two puffs and pass wake me up in the mornin
This ain't nothin like smokin while you gettin some head
Break it down on the chronic album call it breakfast in bed
So mary jane let me know if you wit it
They say weed is like pussy you neva know how good it is till you hit it

Man I get so high can you imagine how fast the weed go
Take two puffs and pass pull out another sack so we can roll that
Man I get so high can you imagine how fast the weed go
Take two puffs and pass pull out another sack so we can roll that

[Ya Boy]
I like my weed purple fluffy just like a pillow
You smoke a little I love to fill up the cigarillo
Outta control mane a different mode mane
Outta my body I feel like I'm on soul plane
Don't ask me how high baby I'm on cloud nine
And Imma be smokin and burnin untill I damn die
Passin it with my people smokin it like its legal
Me and AR higher than two bald eagles
I got some blue weed straight from africa
Too high to drive so I gotta play the passenga
That shita damaga mark it on ya calenda
Everyday is 420 baby I need the cannabis
I smoke a 8th a day I smoke the pain away
I smoke on sunny days and I smoke on rainy days
I'm in love wit it I'm in the club wit it
Don't polute the air just put a dub in it

Man I get so high can you imagine how fast the weed go
Take two puffs and pass pull out another sack so we can roll that
Man I get so high can you imagine how fast the weed go
Take two puffs and pass pull out another sack so we can roll that

[Juice]
Man I be smokin on that bobby brown and I go pound for pound
Roll it up in that swisher cause that's how I get down
And I'm blowin garcia vegas when I'm outta town
And I don't smoke that much because I'm outta town
And know that beacuse I'm rollin wit that 4-5
Them hollow tips make sure that a nigga don't die
In AZ they say that nigga Juice is on fire
In miami they say that nigga juice is loc-da
So I peel it back and get so high oh my
Mary tellin a nigga don't drive no lie
Every nigga I know be smokin that weed
I'm high all the time man my favorite color is green
When you smoke I smoke when you choke I choke
Just don't hit it too fast motherfucker I'm broke
Just puff and pass when you smokin on kush
And my weed got america fucked like george bush

Man I get so high can you imagine how fast the weed go
Take two puffs and pass pull out another sack so we can roll that
Man I get so high can you imagine how fast the weed go
Take two puffs and pass pull out another sack so we can roll that
