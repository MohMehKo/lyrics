[Verse 1: Game]
Jacob sold me my first couple pieces
I was killing niggas who misunderstood what diseased did
Spent half a mill on a Ferrari, I coulda leased it
Driving Scott Storch's Bugatti 'fore they released it
Drop The Documentary, rockin' khakis with creases
Dope and hip hop, it resurfaced with some leeches
Ten times platinum, now I'm chillin' where the beach is
Time to show the world what a motherfuckin' beast is
Blanca, bullet proof cars in Sri Lanka
12 years old, on his shoulder, a rocket launcher
10 thousand miles away, there's an owner of a corner store
A white man walks in, spit shinin' his Audemar
While somewhere in Africa, Jo-Burg and Congo is goin' to war
Rebels enslavin' they own people, diggin' water or
Get murdered 'cus that choppa is a carnivore
He found one and stole it, now the village tryna find that boy

[Hook: Game]
Blood Diamonds
Look at Blood Diamonds
Blood Diamonds
Now take a look at Blood Diamonds
Blood Diamonds
Look at Blood Diamonds
Blood Diamonds
Now take a look at Blood Diamonds

[Verse 2: Game]
How you sellin' the shit our people is diggin' for
Diamonds, cotton, that belong to niggas though
LeBron and Durantula gave America a look at gold
And what you give us back, is another fucking liquor store
And we need blunts, so we walk in that motherfucker
Money in the safe, so we in that motherfucker
But you can't forget the tape, tryna pin a motherfucker
DEA ain't got a case, I'm a win that mothercuker
And it ain't about the Chinese, dude, I eat Chinese food
Where you think Michael Jordan find these shoes
We robbin' each other for 'em, think I should hide these jewels
Run up on you in broad day with them Siamese 2's
But nah, Mandela did 28 straight
Without a fucking complaint, put a afro on a saint
Put a wig on a judge, put a nigga in some chains
Over change, kill him, lethal injection inside his veins

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Game]
Brutus killed Ceasar
And Judas killed Jesus
John Wilkes Boothe killed Lincoln
And you thought he freed slaves, what the fuck was you thinkin'
Nigga fuck Lincoln
I'm rolling up kush in my Lincoln, now let it sink in
Rolled against Obama now you divin' in the deep end
I'd rather take my chances at this water fountain drinkin'
Where the fuck is the loyalty, knock these niggas fuckin' teeth in
In the hood singin' like they Aubrey or The Weeknd
Pull that tile from under that door, and let it seep in
There's a lot of shit I Don't Like, so bring Chief Keef in
I don't like these phony ass jewelers with that fake shit
Overcharging niggas an arm and leg just to make shit
And you wonder why we take shit, y'all put us on slaveships
That's the reason we hate shit, rob my own niggas for them

[Hook]
