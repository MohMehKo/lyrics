[Intro:]
I put that on Piru
Yo Game, let's go

[Hook - Game:]
I've been shot stabbed, left for dead
Walked through every hood in LA, bandana on my head
Guarantee that shit was red
Machetes and them choppers out
Bitches with their knockers out
I done fucked 'em all, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
From the corner playing lookout to kitchen cookouts
Yeah, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
In a 64, 6'5, too big for a Bugatti
That's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga

[Verse 1 - Game:]
Ran the west for a decade nigga, check the bio
Gave you Cincinnati fitteds like I get it in Ohio
Autographs on the vinyl made the Lamb albino
Straight away in the Wraith, that's a Peyton Manning spiral
You lookin' at your idol, Jesus wrote the Bible
Yeezus, that's my Nike town rival
Dare a nigga try me now, like why me now
Lookin' for Red Octobers, I will tie him down
Stay laced, spit nothin' but based, yeah
All my shit bump like Craig Mack face
Ask your favorite bitch how my dick taste
Ask your neighbor's bitch how my dick taste
Don't take orders, I dictate
Get your shit straight, dickface
Perpetual Rollies with the big face
I got 'em lovin' the movement
Beard so long, I'm feelin' like Rick Rubin

[Hook - Game:]
I've been shot stabbed, left for dead
Walked through every hood in LA, bandana on my head
Guarantee that shit was red
Machetes and them choppers out
Bitches with their knockers out
I done fucked 'em all, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
From the corner playing lookout to kitchen cookouts
Yeah, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
In a 64, 6'5, too big for a Bugatti
That's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga

[Verse 2 - Game:]
Top floor at the Biltmore
Say they want a war, shit, that's what I'm built for
Loungin', Miami with the eye candy
Bitches names Sandy and Bambi, my exes can't stand me
God blessed the nigga with more swag than Jigga
More hoes than Trigga, Trigga no, that's my nigga though
Figure four down, Figueroa
Rick Flair Phantom
All red flannel, niggas don't hit me though
Spit on models, R.Kelly, piss on the center fold
Ever since Doc showed me a billion in a envelope
Love Jimmy, fuck Interscope
I'm a don, walk outside, naked, Cuban cigar and Louboutins, huh
Shit on my lawn, snakes in the grass
I hear 'em slitherin' and hissin' whenever I pass
Ridin' 'round in somethin' French; Khloe Kardash'
Two-hundred on the dash, that's your ass

[Hook - Game:]
I've been shot stabbed, left for dead
Walked through every hood in LA, bandana on my head
Guarantee that shit was red
Machetes and them choppers out
Bitches with their knockers out
I done fucked 'em all, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
From the corner playing lookout to kitchen cookouts
Yeah, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
In a 64, 6'5, too big for a Bugatti
That's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga

[Outro - Diddy:]
