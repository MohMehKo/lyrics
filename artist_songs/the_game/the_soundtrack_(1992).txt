Cars drive by in the night
So much sound coming from inside
Red, blue flags hanging from the side
So much time went passing by
The soundtrack to the ghetto was The Chronic
The soundtrack to the ghetto was The Chronic
The soundtrack to the ghetto was The Chronic

Maybe I should move a little
Smoke a little
Fuck around, get high a little
Start reminiscing about the old times
12 years old, cars driving by with gangsters in it
You ain't stand too long cause you already knew it was gangsters in it, nigga
Yeah when everything was copacetic
Till niggas got off them 40 ounces, that's when even the pope can get it
Chronic smoke all in the air, ain't nobody playing fair
And Snoop Dogg had all these niggas around here tryna braid they hair
Red and blue, khaki suits
Us lil niggas got active too
From Lincoln Park, back to the fruits
Us lil niggas had ratchets too
So what you saying nigga?
We ain't playing nigga
We kill your daddy and let your mama do all that praying nigga
Lose your fucking life when them

Cars drive by in the night
So much sound coming from inside
Red, blue flags hanging from the side
So much time went passing by

My mama was a gangster nigga
My daddy was just a gangster nigga
Wasn't for them I wouldn't be from Compton
I should probably thank them niggas
Taught me how to shoot, rob, kill, how to shank a nigga
Maybe I should blame them for all these cases where I done banked a nigga
AKs out of M3's
Prostitutes on bent knees
Gun shots on Greenleaf
All these 64s, no Bentleys nigga
Euros on Cutlasses, you can't rent these niggas
Bout to do a drive-by tonight, that's why we tint these nigga
Heard shots rang out, just riding on my 10 speed
Seen the windows down and the bitch squeezed
Nigga almost died tryna get some weed
So don't be fooled by the palm trees
This Compton nigga, that 310
That 213, we on Death Row
Ain't no one escape unless you DRE
And that's how I felt when

Cars drive by in the night
So much sound coming from inside
Red, blue flags hanging from the side
So much time went passing by
