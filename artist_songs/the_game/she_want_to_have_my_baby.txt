How many bitches in the club just to try to fuck a platinum rapper
Poking microscopic holes into the Magnum rappers
Hopping on the dick but I ain't throwing carrots at ya
You ain't gon' Worldstar me, I ain't your average rapper
You drinking all the Goose then bitch I ain't finna pay
You don't look like your Twitter avatar anyway
Bitch you look like an Avatar anyway
And that's the same bitch that was stalking Fab' ain't it Trey? (Yup)
And this is how I know you're giving free head
If you was getting paid, the bottom of your shoe would be red
But it ain't, she claiming she a saint
But as soon she see Dwight she go hard in the paint
But her girlfriend the type you wanna take home
Throw a little Drake on it really shouldn't take long
Then she told me that she wanna meet Trey Songz
I told that bitch strip and start singing all Trey song's

Millions in the bank and I ain't made me a buck yet
So I guess y'all upset
