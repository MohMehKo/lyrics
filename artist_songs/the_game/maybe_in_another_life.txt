[Chorus:]
I can only try so hard, girl
Remember '95 like our love feel right, girl
And maybe it just wasn't the right time
Maybe in another lifetime

[Verse 1:]
I'm sitting in my Ghost, I don't know what to do
But what I know is I'm at my best when I fuck with you
I always thought we'd kinda end up just like the Huxtables
Thought our love was like Swizz and Alicia, untouchable
Thought we always had that Jay and B potential
And ever since we've been apart everything is instrumental
And I can't even hear the words to my favorite song, I'm so numb inside
Bitch you telling me "boy, I'm ovulating, so just come inside"
I'm kinda torn between what I want and what I know
That's why sometimes after the kids fall asleep I get up and go
Used to chase me down the hallway, acting like you on Broadway
Hop in your Benz, tailing my Range, trying to jump out where that broad stay
And that was crazy but at least I know you care
That was then, this is now, how the fuck did we end up here?
Now we care about our Instagram posts more than each other
Posting subliminal shit like we ain't never met each other, that's crazy

[Chorus:]
So we go,
I can only try so hard, girl
Remember '95 like our love feel right, girl
And maybe it just wasn't the right time
Maybe in another lifetime

[Verse 2:]
We spent the last 24 months arguing over these broads
That we forgot about the show and then Cali became a star
And maybe that was a blessing
'Cause she could grow up to be Reyna Simone at our discretion
I be right there for protection
'Cause these days my kids the only place to get affection
Could be wrong, you a school teacher, maybe I just need correction
You used to be the one to point a nigga in the right direction
Now we both inside Greystone sitting in different sections
Pretending we having fun but what I really want to do
Is get you to that SLS and fuck you till you see the sun
And maybe I wouldn't feel so bad every time I see my son
And he ask am I coming home and I tell him to go ask his mom
And shit get real hard 'cause I can't live without my daughter
You can't just be Beyonc√© and try to ride for Sean Carter
You know I love my kids and can't no nigga replace their father
This could be a love story, view the offer right

[Chorus:]
So we go,
I can only try so hard, girl
Remember '95 like our love feel right, girl
And maybe it just wasn't the right time
Maybe in another lifetime
