[The Game:]
Parked at the light, give a fuck about a bitch nigga
Only nigga worth six figures that still click triggers
On my way to LAX, fuck the freeway
Riding through South Central in the 'Wood like I should
But I'm a Compton nigga, west side monster nigga
You should know by now, I fuck with all kinds of niggas
Call Big U and we going to see about that vagina in you
You don't bang huh? That's that out of town in you
My niggas eat late night, Mel's Diner menu
You a shooter? Better have that North Carolina in you
I had wolves at all kinds of venues
Dub's show I let the snub show
Shall I continue?
Fucking niggas up like it was '05
Like Dre just listened to my whole demo and cosigned
Talking out your neck, get you buried in no time
I heard you niggas looking for me, Blood

Naw fuck that nigga, I'll have a prostitute to open the trunk and cut that nigga
I'll have a couple crooked cops come and touch that nigga
Then get a bully in the pen to come and fuck that nigga
Life is crazy, yeah my life is crazy
Don't let Calabasas fool you, I'll kill you baby
Bury you in my backyard, shit I'm sittin on five acres
You wanna go to war? I got the paper
Nigga wanna fade? I got the taper
Nigga want to shoot? I got the laser

And I don't put no tints on my whip
One strap, full clip nigga!

[80's And Cocaine]

[Sonyae:]
Bullets coming through the windows and the walls
That's on the set, all my niggas on call
Don't pray for me, pray for them niggas
Menace to society, I'm like Lorenz nigga
I want the rims nigga, and your gold chain
Don't blame me, blame 80s and cocaine
I want the rims nigga, and your gold chain
Don't blame me, blame 80s and cocaine

[The Game:]
Ay yo I wake up, put on chronic like bitches makeup
Kush like Nicki and Meek, it's hard to breakup
38 tucked, take a piss and eat my breakfast
Six bitches at my kitchen table ass naked
I got more bitches than Hugh Heff, nigga I'm reckless
Iced out Playboy pendant hanging from my necklace
Used to take a brick chop that bitch up in sections
Pack it in the car like its Mexican no flexin
It's that whip work, chop that, sell it out, we cop that
On Wimbleton and Brazil in my impala with the top back
Where my nigga Top at?
Remember them days before you and Rock brought Watts back?
We was in Stevenson Village in front your crib nigga
Leanin like a top hot, ordering Tommy burgers with everything
Cop back my Glock fat nina Ross Akon black
Bullets pop up out of nowhere like State Farm BLAT!
