Since BIG ain't here, I’mma do it for T’yanna
And put roses on the grave for Kanye’s mama
This for all the lost girls locked up in the pen
All the girls that hold it down, gettin’ beat on by their man
Respect women, I don’t care if they a 2 or a 10
We don’t beat on Kat Stacks we just bring it to an end
And we don’t wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim
There’s missin’ women out there, let’s just focus on them

This song is dedicated to Natalee Holloway
I feel for her Daddy, so I wrote this on Fathers Day
I know she gone, but she ain't far away
I just had a daughter, pass me that cigar ‘Ye
I’m about to tell a story, everybody parlay
Sit back, listen while I kick it, the Compton Boulevard way
My daddy used to beat up on my mama all day
So I took my chronic out and slept in the hallway
I learned this the hard way
When police came our way, my daddy had his act on
Like it never happened: (Broadway)
Plus I was kinda scared to keep it real with you
Now my mama good, nigga, she ain’t gotta deal wit’ ya
You want some money? Nigga I ain't get a deal wit’ ya
You ain't sayin’ nothin’, you like a still picture
You better thank God you still breathing air cause
You coulda went out, like ya boy Steve McNair

[Hook]
Don’t make the good girls go bad, no
Don’t make the good girls go bad, no (I, wont)
If you don't, you gon’ really love us (I said I wont)
Please don’t use us, dooon’t

Good evening, I’m in Chicago at the Elysian
With some girls that say they models, but hmm… I don’t believe ‘em
Who’s still gettin’ tested?
Wheres all the women at, could still remember who they slept with?
Where’s all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list?
But when you do go out, you still working with what you was blessed with
Do it girl, I’ll be your King, be a Queen Latifah
I love ya ass like Milhouse love Lisa
I love ya ass like the ninja turtles love pizza
Ironically enough, you something I want a piece of
You got it girl, this song remind me of Kat from Philly
A girl I used to love but still she started acting silly
Her hearts a lil’ chilly, she a little too carefree
In 10 years, who’s paying for all that therapy
Umm, nigga not me!
Yeah, I’m probably not the man you take me for
But I bet I could be if you make me yours
Most of the shit I say is true
When I’m done with bad bitches I’m coming straight to you
Good girl

[Hook]
Don’t make the good girls go bad, no
Don’t make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't, you gon’ really love us
Please don’t use us, dooon’t

[Game - Verse 3]
Drizzy, I’m sittin here watchin’ Basketball Wives
Like ugh, them is basketball wives?
Only cute one, Gloria, that's my nigga Matt Barnes chick
Can’t swim in that poon fool, that's a crucial conflict
Never sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with
And never buy a chick a bag on the first day
Or pop a bottle with her on her birthday
And tell her ass, get on
That type of shit’ll get you spit on
I don’t hit on girls, I just hit on girls
Like “hey lil mama, come in Game and Drizzy world”
“Get busy girl, drink that Rose til you dizzy girl”
She walking round the club all lost like “where is he, girl?”
He on the top of the charts next to Beyonce
Right under Kanye, so let the Dom spray
That's your girl, nigga go on make her cry
Soon as you do, I’m pulling up in that Porsche, like “Lets ride”

[Hook]
Don’t make the good girls go bad, no
Don’t make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don’t make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't, you gon’ really love us
Please don’t use us, dooon’t

[Game - Outro]
Word on the news stand, Alicia got herself a man
And that's my nigga Swizzy, know you see Game and Drizzy
Surrounded by them diamonds, Imma cold mackin
Nigga its a cold climate, don’t ask me where the crime went
Just tell me where them dimes went
So I can get em fitted, let em beat a bridesmaid at the wedding for my niggas
Yeah I’m married to the game
And she married to my chain, watching Boys In The Hood
Lets take a drive down memory lane.
