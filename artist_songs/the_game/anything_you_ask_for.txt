[Intro:]
The young Roy Jones in the rap shit
Somebody bout to get knocked the fuck out tonight man

[Verse 1:]
Niggas think they got The Game sold
Yeah right I'm air tight
Fresh in them Air Nikes
If the navvy outside
I might be there
Black hoodie, black nine, black white v Airs
Like Caddy trunks keep a spare
You see the lump under the ice berg fleece and yeah
And when the beef cooks I'm a put the piece through your hair
And if you see a white truck that mean the sheets is there
Then I'm goin goin back back to the block
To dump the bucket and jump in the drop
Niggas know I'm good with the glock
They call me chick herns cause The Game or not I'm calling the shots
I wear a shiny suite 4 em and they like them alot
They get gangsta with a SWAT me bag and a Jordan box
So when I die, bury me with the glock and a bucket of shells
In case niggas want drama in Hell

[Chorus:]
I'll give you anything you ask for
Money over bitches!
Tell me what you blast for
We don't fuck around with snitches!
What you have the smash for
This bitch tried to play me man!
Anything you ask for
It's all about the bank Game!
[Repeat twice]

[Verse 2:]
First things first
Money over bitches
Swore say my name in vain watch main
Brake the bones in your nose
I'm a flick time rida
Inner city flipper
Watch who try to flip more like their neighbors want digger
Sergeant at arms who playin, I'm a General
So draw your fire arms when you in the presence of criminals
And motherfuckers subliminal metaphors or adjectives
I come to where you live and send 60 rounds inside your crib!
Killer by instinct
Murderer by nature
Killer Cali earth quakes ya
Ain't nothin but bone brakers
Is nothin like puffin on this justall ass pound
Became in my turner
Have your mouth twisted just like Bobby Brown
Fuck what you might of read
Fuck what your people said
Back in this bitch and o 6 is The Game in lead
Highly anticipated the day has finally came
I slap a patch of meat off a nigga head for Game
Fer real!

[Chorus x2]
