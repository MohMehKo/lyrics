Ayo, Irv, 'the fuck is wrong with these niggas, man?
Talking 'bout I aint no fuckin MC
I been at this shit for 7 years, nigga
8 times platinum, nigga
2 Bentleys, 1 Lambo and 3 houses later
Muthafucka, what's up?

[Verse 1]
Naw, this aint no fucking Dre beat, I got this from Irv Gotti
Game back on the shit I'm enemies with e'rybody
Game cook crack, transform to yeyo
The new Suge Knight, nigga, minus the K.O.
I keep it candy like Mariah, I'm so fire
When step it in the club, "Get Low" like Flo Rida
Cus I'm a pimp, you can tell by the limp
When I st-st-st-step aside the 26 inch
You see my rims? They bigger than Bow Wow
Get money, fuck bitches, that's what I'm about now
The Phantom, ugly, the Bentley, retarded
The kicks still Chuck Taylors, the jacket is a Starter
I beg your pardon, nigga, we can get started
If you aint Nas or that nigga on third Carter
My happy face is Kenneth Supreme mug shot
When it go down, who goin' stop the blood clot?

[Chorus: Newz (The Game)]
Throw yo hands up it's that gangsta shit
All the homies go crazy when they bump my shit
Go ahead and hate on my click
Got a couple words for you nigga, suck my dick
You strapped? (That's right)
Gang bangin? (for life)
A little drama (that's life)
Hit 'em up (Nice)
It's that gangsta shit
All the homies go crazy when they bump my shit

[Verse 2]
Nigga I'm a throw back, you already know that
Got swag and I'm street, picture the nigga Hov' strapped
And it's the rock right in my fuckin sock
Die for my chain, why?
So I can go fuck with Pac
Before I go, I shoot it out with the cops
Hit one for Sean Bell then bleed on the block, yeah
Like Big did, I play with toys like a big kid
Got a snub nose, call it Big Tig
You art not fuck with Game, he crazy
And the bars comin' straight outta Compton, baby
My 16's mean, you know what I mean
Headed to the airport, my flow flying in from Queens
Accompanied by my bitch, flying in with them things
My shorty is a 10, that's that singing nigga, Dream
The life of gangsta in Cali, is to short
So I might as well find me a borrow in New York

[Chorus: Newz (The Game)]
Throw yo hands up it's that gangsta shit
All the homies go crazy when they bump my shit
Go ahead and hate on my click
Got a couple words for you nigga, suck my dick
You strapped? (That's right)
Gang bangin? (for life)
A little drama (that's life)
Hit 'em up (Nice)
It's that gangsta shit
All the homies go crazy when they bump my shit

[Verse 3]
Man you know, I don't give a fuck and I don't give a shit
Any drama, I'm locked on like a red-nose pit
Keep shooting them cap guns with the red nose tips
Have some Cali niggas come out and dead those strips
Give a fuck if you tuff nigga, or you buff nigga
My 4-5 weigh 3 pounds and it'll snuff niggas
Hop out the truck with the gun so long
Let the bullets jump out and ask, "What's going on?"
What the fuck can I say? I grew up a bastard
Got sick in the Impala so I threw up a Aston
I pop big shit, and I keep my wrist slit
My entourage shine like the Diamond District
I got a Rolex, a real big Rolex
With so many rock, the Africans is trying to protest
Bully of the block, why? Cus they got me top 5
There's four niggas better than me? Nigga, stop lyin!

[Chorus: Newz (The Game)]
Throw yo hands up it's that gangsta shit
All the homies go crazy when they bump my shit
Go ahead and hate on my click
Got a couple words for you nigga, suck my dick
You strapped? (That's right)
Gang bangin? (for life)
A little drama (that's life)
Hit 'em up (Nice)
It's that gangsta shit
All the homies go crazy when they bump my shit

Newz!
Niggas better know what the fuck they dealin with
When they dealing with the fuck they dealin with
You dealin with a fuckin animal, man
Gotti will tell you, nigga, both the Gottis, nigga
You can bring John Gotti back too, nigga
He'll tell you, man
I'm gangsta, nigga
I was Murda Inc. before anything, man
Black Wall Street, Murda Inc., man
Before there was a Dr. Dre there was a Irv Gotti, nigga
When I was running around with P. Diddy in Atlanta, nigga
Slapping asses, nigga
Mario ?? know what it is, nigga
Mix bitches all up in the height on Peach St., nigga
Been getting money, nigga
7 years strong, nigga
2 platinum albums, nigga
'Bout to be three
Ay, nigga that's muthafuckin hip hop menage a trios
BITCH!
