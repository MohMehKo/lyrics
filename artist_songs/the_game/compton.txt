[Verse 1: Game]
I wake up in the morning chilling with my feet up
Looking on my Instagram for pussy to beat up
Hey, Sap turn that beat up, Hey nigga roll that weed up
Riding through the hood top down trowing that B up
Turn that YG up
Cause niggas fed up
Niggas get murdered in my city not keeping their head up
I'm talking Bloods, Crips and shit
Bodies twisting like Liquorice
Watch when that pistol lit [Chik-Chik], Niggas hit the fence
Cowards, ducking in led showers
Couple of niggas be snitching, pointing like watch towers [Shshsh]
That's how niggas get locked up
40 Glocc tough? what?
That nigga got sucked up
And he suing me for four point five
Let me see, move the Desmin
Once to the right, that's a forty five
Glock hit the light, now you a vegetable

[Bridge 1: Game]
Tell 'em niggas where I'm from... you heard
Stat tell em niggas where I'm from
Hey ya'll tell em niggas where I'm from... Esco
Drake, tell em niggas where I'm from

[Bridge 2: Game]
The City of money, power and tears
Overdoses, nightmares, Yeah
Can't walk Around here keep talking around here guns spark around here
Yeah

[Verse 2: Stat Quo]
An honor nigga, my nigga raise my J's gram plays
Throwing up 3's my doggs squeeze triggers
Dreaming on what we be when we bigger
Firm Biz deliver
Haters shiver, they see us
So Dance Field (filled) with divas
Sniffing Justin Bieber
We staying in the game
You Lames's in the bleachers
Luxury vehicles with all the latest features
The Preachers can't reach us
Smoking Kush on the beaches, no reception
It's a blessing ever since recession just progressing
Bank account stretching models in my section
Has I stare at my reflection?, Boss Nigga
This bitches love my complication, they ain't just talk nigga
Huh
Crack in the pot let it bubble on the block
Watch it double so we can huddle and ball with the prof
Got niggas from, Watson, Swatson and niggas from Harlem
But my niggas from Compton it's a problem
Firm Biz

[Bridge 1: Game]
(Stat Quo: Yeah) Tell 'em niggas where I'm from... you heard
Stat tell em niggas where I'm from (Stat Quo: DT)
Hey ya'll tell em niggas where I'm from... Esco
Drake, tell em niggas where I'm from

[Bridge 2: Game]
The City of money, power and tears
Overdoses, nightmares, Yeah
Can't walk Around here keep talking around here guns spark around here
Yeah

[Outro: Stat Quo]

Half price ass bitch ass soft ass lame ass nigga
