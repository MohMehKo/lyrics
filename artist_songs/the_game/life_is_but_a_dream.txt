I am happy to join with you today
In what will go down in history
As the greatest demonstration for freedom
In the history of our nation

So it seems I'm lost
In between exotic cars in Phoenix
Palms hella itchy baby mama bitchy
Dish washer broke cause them pots too sticky
Snap back to the back cause I got that crack
And I'm from that city
Where even the girls is packed
And I'm strapped this zone they don't hear that rap
Shit unless it's watch he a problem
Then them bitches turn up ASAP
Like they went to school in Harlem
But they know they from Compton
Yeah they know they from Compton
Where we put bass with the head
Before Dre was with Monster
We pull guns on niggas before we ever play contra
Turn up countering they bands and
I make them hoes dance so
Let that bitch breathe before she take yo kids
And you be forced to watch that bitch leave
And that's every nigga's situation
In a town where them gang signs go up
And them bitches going down

Life is a but a dream
I'm searching for a dream
So I'm finally free
Don't let me, don't save me
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
I'm searching for a dream
So I'm finally free
Don't let me, don't save me
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream

A great American in whose symbolic shadow
We stand today signed the Emancipation Proclamation
But one hundred years later the nigro still is not free

Niggas rock two chains and one star
I seen these niggas runnin
Them ain't yo niggas no more
Cause I got macks comin
You take a nigga jewels
And act like you done did something
We take a nigga life and act like we ain't did nothing
And all of this is like a push of a button
I got niggas bustin simply because they ribs touchin
And we ain't tryna work the Nicky D
Niggas is tryin to put that six on D's
And flip one of them Bentley keys
Hood niggas that only wanna be hood with
Stack 100 cash and then you safe and wife a good bitch
Cop a Gucci belt maybe in Louie 2
Line at challenger with that Camaro
And see what it do?
Hit toxic cause we got a fit and cane wasted
It's hot as fuck but at least we can see these hoes' faces
And it's drama what that shit do
Every time we hit the city
Give'em a couple hoes and a pistol
Cause I, I hold my niggas down
I said I, I hold my niggas down
Yeah I hold my niggas down
And the day I go out this is Kendrick's crown

No we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied
Until justice rolls down like waters
And righteousness like a mighty stream

Life is but a dream
Life is but a dream
Life is everything but a dream
