Operation kill everything kill everything
Married to myself fuck a wedding ring
Tried that shit twice
Gave that girl everything
She a good woman
She got good goals
Love her to death but can't be in that fishbowl
Niggas gotta live and what the fuck does it matter?
If I take care of my kids
I got three of them little niggas
And every time they smile
I see me in them little niggas
I get my heart I get my soul
And nobody fucking with me till Harlem 20 years old
Any day I'm gonna retire
Look back at my career
Like I started from the bottom
Now I'm motherfuckin here
Look back at my career like I started

Started to do something
Shit I've been working out for two summers
In the gym I piled on cruel summer
When everybody doping your clique you do numbers
But I ain't got no clique
Still got the same cars and broads sucking my dick
Still fuck the same stars that up in my six
Still finding old panties and broads up in my whip
This bitch got my dick hard as Rock Nation
That's like Cole and Hove at a show keeping fans waiting
And you know they ain't go do that
Girl go and do that
Guess it's time to turn up
I got a whole lot of marijuana to burn up
And I ain't mean to make you stop
But it ain't a party without aqua hydrate and Ciroc so

What's up? It's yo boy Diddy man
I'm just getting back from Vegas
Yeah man, party was off the chain
I'm back in sunny California and it never rains
Yeah yeah yeah all that man
So I decided to throw a white party man
So I'm at the mansion now
Got the pool, filled it up with aqua hydrate
So you know when the chicks in the pool, they correctly balanced
And also got Ciroc fountains overflowing
Blue dot, red dot, white dot
I want you to come bring the whole crew
Bring out West Coast love
The whole white party man
And we gonna leave colors at home, I know you wanna be all red man
But you gotta wear all white to this one man
You gotta wear all white to this one man
I see y'all like the white party at the mansion man
Y'all let's get it, love
Ay yo chop, for real, wear all white

Love it's Ash, I got this fired up Kush from my cousin
I'm a come over and smoke it later alright?
Alright

Hey Lucky it's Andrea
Calling you from this bitch Ashley's house
I'm bout to suck the skin off yo dick
And she ain't even know it
Hey Lucky it's Andrea
Calling you from this bitch Ashley's house
I'm bout to suck the skin off yo dick
And she ain't even know it

Guess we're going to Diddy's
It ain't a party without the king of the fucking city
Handsome ass nigga these bitches is fucking with me
Woke up in that new Bugatti
These pigs ain't fuckin' with me
I'm like Dr. J with his frown
Something like Boston Georgia with the blow
Pumping white hat, I got it just so you know
Slumber life I'm zipping up all this dough
Summer nights we at toxic with all these hoes
Then we back at the mansion take off them clothes
I let my niggas hit it first
I'm in and out
Just as fast as niggas spit a verse then they out
Then I'm back to the booth
Rollin up sipping something 80 proof
And I don't chase the liquor or these hoes
Heard Jordan got some new shit out book order those
Just bought me a ghost like where the Rolls
Perrier at the club with all my bros
Can't get none of my bitches to get these hoes
Plus I sit back and still get paid like Derrick Rose

Stat we then started something
Stat we then started something
Stat we then started something
Ready to die almighty get a car or something
Unzip that Louie, go buy a car or something
We just started something
Stat we just started something
Ready to die almighty get a car or something
