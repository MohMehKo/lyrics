[Verse 1:]
All you bitches is Nicki Minaj sons
So get her a trash bag so she can pick up her ones
She bend down I see her tracks
I make it rain she throw it back
And all this money keep me and pussy, no Kat Stacks
But I got racks on racks on racks
Pool side at the W, take a puff and relax
It's that millionaire lifestyle, Audemar iced out
Order more spades then hit 'em with that lifestyle
But these fakes hoes won't leave me alone
Fake bag, fake ass and she beggin' for patron
My credit Meagan Good, my money Nia Long
And them heels you got on, pound sign

[Hook:]
Basic bitch
I got a bitch with me, she got a bitch with her
And I ain't talkin' 'bout no basic bitch
Beyonc√©, laced front on
Who you trying to front on? And stunt on?
You just a basic bitch, she got a fake Louie
Fake Loubie's [Christian Louboutin Red Bottoms], fake booty
So she a basic bitch
At the club all weekend, she trying to get rich
But all I got is this dick for a basic bitch

[Verse 2:]
So knock it off with your knock-off
You give head to any nigga riding with his top off
You the type I'd knock off, forget I ever met you
Block you on Twitter, never BBM or text you
Lookin' for the next you, I just wanted to sex you
Hit you on the D-Low, I'm Cee-Lo, F you
'Cause every time I'm up in the club looking for hoes
Everything look good off a couple bottles of rose
Down low with your swag, stuntin' off of your toes
And paintin' a mental picture of you without all your clothes
Have you ever fucked a millionaire in the back of a Rolls?
With Amber Rose? I ain't talking 'bout no

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I can tell by your avatar, you never had caviar
Your friends can't go, you can't go, you don't have a car
But that weave hanging down to your ass
Bitch ain't from Dallas, but she rooting for the Mav's
You a bandwagon ho for sure
You up in every video takin' off your clothes
I thought I told you that you wouldn't get far
Melyssa Ford did, seen her in Choclair, now that Honda Accord is,
A 2012 range, now look how times change
You bitches'll never get a ring, LeBron James
'Cause I got all the game, used to move Danity Kane
Gettin' dirty money with my little

[Hook]
