[Verse 1:]
Some nights I hop in that Impala feeling like fuck the bullshit
Riding down Compton Boulevard with a full clip
Ain't stopping at no red lights, niggas getting smoked, where I come from
And to the T Flats, it's fuck niggas, they be on one
But you gotta worry about your own
Niggas'll fuck your bitch behind your back and leave a knife in that motherfucker
Infiltrate your home, same niggas you let kick it
Can't see em but you hear em like a cricket
And just yesterday ya'll was smoking til he asked for a handout
Since you the good nigga always passing the bands out
Gave him a stack, [?] ain't never enough
It's a cold world, who can you trust?

[Chorus:]
When your baby momma tripping and your niggas on some bullshit
Gotta watch who you fuck with and who you fool with
Fuck around, get murdered by a nigga you was cool with
And set up by the same bitch you used to go to school with
Sometimes you gotta ride solo, sometimes
Sometimes you gotta ride solo
Loyalty ain't the same
You ain't alive if you never felt pain

[Verse 2:]
One of my niggas stole some money from a nigga, he was tripping
That's why you never bring your homeboys where you living
Chose the wrong path, thought a nigga wouldn't find out
Laid up in LA, using the bitch as a hideout
Couldn't tell em shit and every time I cried out
He left me in the middle of the street like a wideout
Told em don't go, but he ain't listen, now he gone
Spent the rest of the night chirping the nigga phone
Next morning came, see my brother outside
Tears running down his face, knew my homeboy died
And I'd be lying if I say I didn't cry
It been 10 years, still asking God why?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Coming home from the studio, nigga on your couch
Talking to your baby mama, fuck is that about
Raise a eyebrow, but you let the shit go
She a cold ass bitch, nigga, everybody know
But not at in the beginning, she was fine as hell
So you went in her, fucked up, thought you had you a winner
And little did you know, she had niggas on the side
Tryna be a family man, had to let the shit ride
Whole damn time, bitch thinking she was slick
On top of you but mind on another nigga dick
Only think she ain't do was bring a nigga round your kids
Bitches ain't shit but that's just how it is

[Chorus]
