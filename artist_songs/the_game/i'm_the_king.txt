[Chorus]
I'm the king
And I be smokin'
Welcome to my town
And I be smokin'

I'm the king
And I be smokin'
Welcome to my town
And I be smokin'

If I say we on one muthafucker we on
If I say we gon' my nigga then we gon'
And I say we drinkin' then we drinkin' that Patron
And if I say we rollin' then somebody rollin' zone

Ay-yeh-yeeeeh

[Verse 1]
This shit right here nigga
How you smokin', how you chokin'
how you chokin' while you rollin' I be zonin'
In the morning wake and bake'n while I'm yawnin'
It's that get lo, Benz-o, be careful around them rims hoe
run and tell your friends that we 'bout to get it in
And we smokin' on this endo
Let it breath crack a window
blowing on this purple in this Enzo

[Chorus]
Nigga I'm the King
And I be smokin'
Welcome to my town
And I be smokin'

I'm the king
And I be smokin'
Welcome to my town
And I be smokin'

If I say we on one nigga then we on
If I say we gon' my nigga then we gon'
And I say we drinkin' then we drinkin' that Patron
And if I say we rollin' then somebody rollin' zone

Ay-yeh-yeeeeh

[Verse 2]
What you smokin' can't fuck with the shit that I be blazin'
Walk in the store, eyes so low they probably think I'm asian
Red bone, red car, aint this bitch amazing
red hot, red bottoms, spicy like she cajun
red rims, red cuts lookin' like a st-a-ar
tell a nigga ballin' by the emblem on his ca-a-ar
so fa-a-ar, so go-o-ood
this is what they call me in the ho-o-ood

[Chorus]

You smokin', who got the flame?
Gettin high as them Chevy doors when I'm rolling up paper planes
I'm just sayin', wipe ya feet off before you step in the door
Been bangin' since '94, you didn't but now you know
Them bitches hittin' the flo'
Then switches hittin' the flo'
Them swishes is good to go
And that pruple off in ya throat, so, yo
You ain't know this is how we ride
And we can take this nigga outside
Recognize

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Zoned up, 'troned up
this is what you want
Bottles up, lighters up
This some shit to smoke to
Zoned up, 'troned up
this is what you want
Bottles up, lighters up
This some shit to smoke to
I'm the King!
