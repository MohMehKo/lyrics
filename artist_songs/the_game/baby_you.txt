Baby you know you got me going crazy
You run around my head like these waves
Yeah baby you
You know that you the one that I adore
The one I introduce to Tom Ford at dinner
That was you
You'se the one I fell in love with
The one I move these drugs with
But now you on some fuck shit
Anybody but you
I ain't figured it that you would be the one to cut me
Leave me on the floor fucking bloody, God damn
Baby you, you had me fooled the whole time
Now you got me in King of Diamonds giving these hoes time
Girl, baby you
I can't blame you though
When you see the door, you see the door
Now listen, baby you

[Jason Derulo:]
Every time I decide to leave you all in the past
Baby I be thinking bout you on the long drive, yeah
And you ain't no one make me feel unsatisfied, no
But baby you, you got me going
But you got me going, you got me going
But you got me, you got me, you got me, you got me, you got me, yeah
You got me, you got me, you got me, you got me, you got me

[The Game:]
Tell me how you think we living how we live?
Like you the one that put us in these cribs
Not me but baby you
Like I ain't getting money for these shows
I guess you think I'm tripping on these hoes
They fans but look at you
Who in them Celine bags? Who in them Giuseppes?
Louboutins, wanna bet me? I win cause it's you
You begged me to get on that show
I ain't want it but you did
I'm a real nigga I did it for you
You don't see Swizz and Alicia
Kim K and Kanye arguing all the time
It's just you
I begged you to marry me
Half a million dollars out my safe down the drain
But fuck it cause that was you
Damn we got some beautiful kids
But you never say it something we did
I guess your baby daddy you
Regardless of the shit we go through
I got Jason in the booth, 2 AM singing shit about you

[Jason Derulo:]
Every time I decide to leave you all in the past

Blood is money and I spent it on ya
Ain't it funny how it ended up in
