Hidee Hidee Ho
Making love wherever we go
Hidee Hidee Hee
Making love just you and me

How could she reject me
Send me on my way
How could she suspect me
Of leading her astray

I met her accidentally
And I asked to see her home
She told me she wouldn't mind
And we commenced to roam

Hidee Hidee Ho
Making love wherever we go
Hidee Hidee Hee
Making love just you and me

I took out my pen knife
And showed it at this rake
He looked at me as if to say
You're making a mistake

I do not frighten easily
Yet no weapon I possess
No matter what you thinkin', son
You better second guess

Hidee Hidee Ho
Making love wherever we go
Hidee Hidee Hee
Making love just you and me

Hidee Hidee Ho
Making love wherever we go
Hidee Hidee Hee
Making love just you and me
