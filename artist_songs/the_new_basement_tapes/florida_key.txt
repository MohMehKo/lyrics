Miami woman so fine and fair
I try and try but I can't get anywhere
I sail out under the sun
Looking for my darling, my only one
I sail all day, and when the day is done
She's still the one I want to see
I must find that Florida Key

Collins Avenue, Fifth Street and Main
I walk up and down but it's all in vain
My only darling is gone
Took everything and put it out on the lawn
And Jim came and got it and he gave it to John
It's getting harder and harder to be me
I must find that Florida Key

Just standing on the curb watching for boats
While them boys and girls pass by on their big silver goats
I'm getting out while the getting is good
In my ship of steel or in my ship of wood
One more time I'm gonna do just like I should
See, this could only happen to me
I must find that Florida Key

Need a little sunshine in my beer
Thinking 'bout eloping
Nothing's locked, never will be
Everything is open

There's only one thing that lurks in my mind
It's nothing here, nothing I've left behind
There's something up front, something I hope to find
I'm gonna set sail again tonight
Round the horn and in the clear moonlight
Or at least I'm sure it's going to be
Soon as I find my Florida Key
