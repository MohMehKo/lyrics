Well I knew I was young enough
And I knew there was nothing to it
'Cause I'd already seen it done enough
And I knew there was nothing to it

There was no organization I wanted to join
So I stayed by myself and took out a coin
There I sat with my eyes in my hand
Just contemplating killing a man

For greed was one thing I just couldn't stand
If I was you, I'd put back what I took
A guilty man's got a guilty look
Heads I will and tails I won't
As long as the call wouldn't be my own

Well you don't have to turn your pockets inside out
But I'm sure you can give me something
Well you don't have to go into your bank account
But I'm sure you can give me something

Well I knew I was young enough
And I knew there was nothing to it
'Cause I'd already seen it done enough
And I knew there was nothing to it

Well I knew I was young enough
And I knew there was nothing to it
'Cause I'd already seen it done enough
And I knew there was nothing to it
And I knew there was nothing to it
And I knew there was nothing to it
And I knew there was nothing to it
And I knew there was nothing to it
