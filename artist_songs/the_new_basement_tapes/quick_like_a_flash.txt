Quick like a flash, we got to border that bus
Go down on the hump and screw it
We don't need your opinions take a look at us
When we find something good, we're true to it

Revenge is sweet when we take a trip or two
Put ol' Peter in the pocket
Then pull in or out and paint 'em blue
Put a bow tie on 'em, and sock it

Quick like a flash
Quick like a flash
Quick like a flash

Crossharp's coming just once that's all
Oh baby, wontcha please come use him
Gang up on the punk and a big checker haul
Poor little punk, don't bruise him

Quick like a flash, we got to border that bus
Go down on the hump and screw it
We don't need your opinions take a look at us
When we find something good, we're true to it

Quick like a flash
Quick like a flash
Quick like a flash
