I see by the papers that
He came from the old religion but possessed no magic skill
Descending from machinery, he left nothing from his will

Thank you for not helping me out
For not treating me like a fool
If you didn't lay me on a cold mattress at night
I might be kicking more than your mule

Crops are failing, women are wailing

Six months in Kansas City
(Can't find no room and board)
Six months in Kansas City
(What can lead to that kind of reward?)
Six months in Kansas City
(All my good friend in jail lost out)
Six months in Kansas City
(Some who ain't got no bail bust out)
Six months in Kansas City
(But they find the track and make you come back)
Six months in Kansas City
(Down on your knees, not even a breeze, ain't it a pity?)
Six months in Kansas City

Well here now Baby Snooks
It donâ€™t matter how many books
You got underneath your thumb
Descended from machinery
You've got nothing left to come

Thank you for not helping me out
For not treating me like a fool
If you didn't lay me on a cold mattress at night
I might be kicking more than your mule

Crops are failing, women are wailing

Six months in Kansas City
(Woe! Can't be begging for no last meal)
Six months in Kansas City
(Cause a man to rob and steal)
Six months in Kansas City
(All my good friend confounded, indeed)
Six months in Kansas City
(Some lost and some drown and some turn to greed)
Six months in Kansas City
(Some wake one day and they've made them king)
Six months in Kansas City
(Make a man ready to do anything)
Six months in Kansas City
(Things sure don't look too pretty)
Six months in Kansas City
(Are you ready?)
Six months in Kansas City
(Are you ready?)
Six months in Kansas City
(Are you ready to admit defeat?)
Six months in Kansas City
(Take your place down on Liberty Street)
Six months in Kansas City
