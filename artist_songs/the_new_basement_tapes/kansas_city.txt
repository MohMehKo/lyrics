I listen to you time and time again
While you tell me just what's right
And you tell me a thousand things a day
Then sleep somewhere's else at night
I'm going back to Kansas City

And I love you dear, but just how long
Can I keep singing the same old song
And I love you dear, but just how long
Can I keep singing the same old song
I'm going back to Kansas City

And you call me to come, then I do
And you say you made some mistake
You invite me into your house
Then you say you gotta pay for what you break
I'm going back to Kansas City

And I love you dear, but just how long
Can I keep singing the same old song
And I love you dear, but just how long
Can I keep singing the same old song
I'm going back to Kansas City

Gypsy woman, you know every place I go
Even a thousand miles away from home
You don't care if I'm asleep or I'm awake
This fickle heart just turn to stone
I'm going back to Kansas City

And I love you dear, but just how long
Can I keep singing the same old song
And I love you dear, but just how long
Can I keep singing the same old song
I'm going back to Kansas City
