When I set my eyes on you
Gonna keep you outta town at night
When I set my eyes on you
Not gonna be outta my sight

And now you know
Everywhere on Earth you go
You’re gonna have me as your man

When I get my hands on you
Gonna make you carry me
When I get my hands on you
Gonna make you marry me

And now you know
Everywhere on Earth you go
You’re gonna have me as your man

When I come home to you
Gonna take you down to the riverside
When I come home to you
Hold you in my arms all night

And now you know
Everywhere on Earth you go
You’re gonna have me as your man
And now you know
Everywhere on Earth you go
You’re gonna have me as your man
