There were three sailors, bold and true
With cargo they did carry
They sailed away on the ocean blue
For the love of Spanish Mary

So deeply now were they disturbed
No longer could they tarry
Swoon and swerve
For the love of Spanish Mary

In Kingston Town of high degree
The buffoon, the fool, the fairy
All paid the dues and inquired to me
For the love of Spanish Mary

Beggar man, beggar man tell me no lie
Is it a mystery to live or is it a mystery to die?

I seek ye not to ask of you
It was in Kingston Town indeed
It is said they stopped but not for greed
But for the love of Spanish Mary

I remember well, they came one day
The buffoon, the fool, the fairy
They asked of me what could I say
For the love of Spanish Mary

’Tis not of me to talk absurd
No rumour do I carry
No, I’ll not give you one word
But for the love of Spanish Mary

Beggar man, beggar man tell me no lie
Is it a mystery to live or is it a mystery to die?
