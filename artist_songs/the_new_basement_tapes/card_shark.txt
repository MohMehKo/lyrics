There are many kinds of fish that swim in the sea
There's others that swim in the dark
And of those troupers and trouts and dolphins and whales
The one you must watch is the shark

Card shark (Yes, ma'am)
Get 'em in the nose
That ol' card shark

Now I sat me down to have some fun
I jumped in the tank for a spell
I boogalooed in the bunkhouse and saw some bandits on the run
I went down to get water from the well

Card shark (Yes, ma'am)
Get 'em in the nose
That ol' card shark

Now set 'em up, Samba
Sit on it awhile
Toss in the towel and have a kick
Stick it in the rear and roar for a bit
And waddle down the road like a brick

Card shark (Yes, ma'am)
Get 'em in the nose
That ol' card shark
