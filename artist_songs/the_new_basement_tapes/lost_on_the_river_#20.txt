The tears of a woman are hidden within
As she moves from one to the next, her spirit grows thin
And when she falls in love with one, it's hard but it's true
But it's oh so much harder when that man is you

I got lost on the river, but I got found
I got lost on the river, but I didn't drown

One stormy day I was out at sea
The waves they rolled and tumbled over me
I spied dry land and a tall pale tree
I knew that soon that's where I'd like to be

My sweetheart left me for another one
And now I wait for the next rising sun

I got lost on the river, but I got found
I got lost on the river, but I didn't drown
I got lost on the river, but I didn't go down
I got lost on the river, but I got found
