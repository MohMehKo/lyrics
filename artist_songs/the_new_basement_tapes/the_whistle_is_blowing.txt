The whistle is blowing, and the train is blowing
Just what's gonna happen next, well, I'm not one to say
I'm sitting here yearning while those wheels keep turning
"I'll be gone by tonight," she told me today

And next door to the cornstalk by the side of this sheet rock
I will wait for the morning like a dog in the moon

Blow, blow on
Blow, blow on

Oh the minutes go slow now, and I hope it don't snow now
'Cause it's quiet and still and that train's out of sight
All we need is a fat storm to blow by the platform
Oh dear me, that woman, that woman's always right

Blow, blow on
Blow, blow on

Blow, blow on
Blow, blow on

The whistle is blowing, and the train is going
Just what's gonna happen next, well, I'm not the one to say
