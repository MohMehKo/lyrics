They say that today makes up for what yesterday lacked
And it must be some old day and that is a fact
Can't talk to nobody, don't know just how they'll react
Weigh the silver and gold
Be precise and exact

How can today make up for yesterday
For if we break up, I guess you would stay

Buffalo Bill wouldn't have known what to do
If he got a just one look, just one good look at you
And I don't know what to do either
Just want to tell you it's neither
Tom said "Don't take her,"
Judas said "Leave her"

How can today make up for yesterday
For if we break up, I guess you would stay

So Golden Tom said to poor Silver Judas
"It's so hard to say who's the worst of the two of us
So don't brood
There's no fraud in this fued
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what to do"

How can today make up for yesterday
For if we break up, I guess you would stay
