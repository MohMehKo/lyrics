Happy llama,
Sad llama,
Mentally disturbed llama,
Super llama,
Drama llama,
Big fat mama llama.

Llama, llama, llama, who is this big llama?
Starting all this drama?
It's me, bitch.

Yes, I am that llama,
That llama you despise,
With those big ass eyes,
And them luscious thighs.
I mean, yes look at me I'm that l-l-a-m-a that doesn't even fucking care what you have to fucking say, oops!

Happy llama,
Sad llama,
Mentally disturbed llama,
Super llama,
Drama llama,
Big fat mama llama.

Back to the basics,
I'm that bitch on craigslist
That looks like a rapist.
Wait, why am I on craigslist?
Oh yeah, to buy a llama
That will be my new mama.
Mama, llama,
Mama, llama,
Llama, llama,
Mama, llama,
Hold up! Wait a minute.
