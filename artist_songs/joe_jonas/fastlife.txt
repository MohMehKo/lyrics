I don't really know what you’re thinking
But I know what we're drinking
Let me put your night in drive

Cat walking on the runway,
Tripping long on the highway,
Going home is only right, yeah

Can't see nothing but blur lines,
Acting like it's your first time,
Girl, I’m done with these games,
And you need to get in my lane
Pushing it to the red line
Hey, hey hey

[Chorus:]
Girl, you know that you want it, and you know we’re going,
Girl, you know where we're going, and you know that you want it.
Girl, get in my ride. Girl, get in my ride. Girl, get in my…
Turn the lights out, put the top down, are you ready fast life?
Turn the lights out, put the top down, are you ready fast life?

When I’m in the streets, I’m speedin’
In the sheets, no reason
Lookin’ in your eyes I see the signs
Push the start up, louder than a siren
Then we focus on silence
Then go another ride

Can't see nothing but blur lines,
Acting like it's your first time,
Girl, I’m done with these games (these games),
And you need to get in my lane (my lane)
Pushing it to the red line
Hey, hey hey

[Chorus]

Girl, get in my ride [x2]

Turn the lights out, put the top down, are you ready fast life?
Turn the lights out, put the top down, are you ready fast life?

[Chorus]

Turn the lights out, put the top down, are you ready fast life?
Turn the lights out, put the top down, are you ready fast life?
