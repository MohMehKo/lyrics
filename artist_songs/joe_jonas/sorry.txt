It can be a rush
Yeah, it's like a drug
When you give up love, it's never worth it
When you're fighting fear, it can be so clear
What you really need is each other
But I finally found the truth

I was using you
Every night you're gonna swear it hurts
You're the atmosphere
Now you're gone I can't live
Tell me what to do
I feel the pain all over my body.
Was it the things I said?

Can I take them back?
Baby, cause without you there's nothing left of me
We could run away
We could change our fate
Baby, what can I do to show you I'm sorry?

What can I do to show you I'm sorry?

You were in a rush
You forgot yourself
Said you had enough, now I feel worthless
The only thing I had was a second chance
What I really need is another
Cause I finally found the truth

I was using you
Every night you're gonna swear it hurts
You're the atmosphere
Now you're gone I can't live

Tell me what to do
I feel the pain all over my body.
Was it the things I said?
Can I take them back?
Baby, cause without you there's nothing left of me

We could run away
We could change our fate
Baby, what can I do to show you I'm sorry?
What can I do to show you I'm sorry, babe?
What can I do to show you I'm sorry?

Throw it away, Girl my heart is out of place
This feeling is killing me
Girl I promise I won't make the same mistakes twice
Don't say "bye"
I'm sorry [x10]

What can I do to show you I'm sorry?
What can I do to show you I'm sorry?
Was it the things I said?
Baby tell me what I did

Baby, cause without you there's nothing left of me
We could run away
We could change our fate
Baby, what can I do to show you I'm sorry?

What can I do to show you I'm sorry?
What can I do to show you I'm sorry?
I'm sorry [x3]
Sorry sorry baby
What can I do to show you I'm sorry?
