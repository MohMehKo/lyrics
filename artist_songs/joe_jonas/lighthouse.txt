Remember when I asked you just to stay
Said you’d be gone for a while but be back someday
But suddenly the truth doesn’t feel so safe
You made a promise
You didn’t keep it

There’s no windows in this lighthouse
No answers to the questions why
No way to be found, be found now
Through the fog
So I’m trapped in this lighthouse, lighthouse

My heart is getting cold as I count the days
I would give my soul for the chance to see her
But all I see are these painted walls
I’m going crazy, crazy, crazy

There’s no windows in this lighthouse
No answers to the questions why
No way to be found, be found now
Through the fog
So I’m trapped in this lighthouse, lighthouse

This cliff I’m on is too steep to climb down
I need for you to save from drowning
And a thousand tears will make a waterfall from me
You’ll see
And it’s loud and clear that I’m not getting off this rock
So stuck in this lighthouse

There’s no windows in this lighthouse (No, no)
No answers to the questions why
No way to be found, be found now
Through the fog
So I’m trapped in this lighthouse, lighthouse
