We used to laugh and cry
I used to give you all of my time
When we would say goodbye
I could see sadness in your eyes
And what will it take
To get everything back ok
Cause I don’t really wanna feel this way
If it’s not too late
Maybe we could change our fate
And undo all of our mistakes

We’ve come too far to give up
(Not right now)
Can’t go on cause you know I love you still
(Not right now)
Baby, we can’t give up no
(Not right now)
No stranger to pain, I know how it feels
(Not right now)
Hey-eyyyy
(Not right now)
Ohhh-ohhh
(Not right now)
Hey-eyyyy

And where did we go wrong?
We went from love to not getting along
We fight until the early morn
Made me not even wanna come home
But nowadays
I sit and reminisce about us, babe
Cause everything I miss about us, baby
If it’s not too late
Maybe we could change our fate
And undo all of our mistakes

We’ve come too far to give up
(Not right now)
Can’t go on cause you know I love you still
(Not right now)
Baby we can’t give up no
(Not right now)
No stranger to pain I know how it feels
(Not right now)

We’ve come too far to give up
(Not right now)
Can’t go on cause you know I love you still
(Not right now)
Baby we can’t give up no
(Not right now)
No stranger to pain I know how it feels
(Not right now)

Never thought it would be this way
(Not right now)
Do everything just to make you stay
(Not right now)
Tomorrow I'll give you up not today
(Not right now)
Yeah, no one wanna give you up

We’ve come too far to give up
(Not right now)
Can’t go on cause you know I love you still
(Not right now)
Baby we can’t give up no
(Not right now)
No stranger to pain I know how it feels
(Not right now)

We’ve come too far to give up
(Not right now)
Can’t go on cause you know I love you still
