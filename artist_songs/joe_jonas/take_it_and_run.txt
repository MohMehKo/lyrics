Let's go!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Let's go!

Baby, so happy that you made it out tonight
With the way you look under these lights
You're the brand new owner of my eyes, my eyes
I know, I know, many men have tried and failed before
And baby I'm pretty sure that tonight, tonight,
Will change your life, grab my hand, watch us fly

So many things I can't wait to show ya
So many things I can't wait to show ya
Give me the chance to get to know ya
Say yes before the night is over

Here's our chance let's
Take it and run
Take it and run
Here's our chance, let's
Take it and run
Take it and run

Baby, you take my breath with every step, with every move
How you do it I have no clue
Girl, I cannot lie, I'm so into you
Oh, oh, baby, I promise if you give this a try
You'll be more than satisfied
So, open the door and let me in brand new life, let's begin

So many things I can't wait to show ya.
So many things I can't wait to show ya.
Give me the chance to get to know ya.
Say yes before the night is over.

So many things I can't wait to show ya.
So many things I can't wait to show ya.
Give me the chance to get to know ya.
Say yes before the night is over.

Here's our chance let's
Take it and run
Take it and run
Here's our chance let's
Take it and run
Take it and run

Here's our chance let's
Take it and run
Take it and run
Here's our chance let's
Take it and run
Take it and run

So many things I can't wait to show ya.
