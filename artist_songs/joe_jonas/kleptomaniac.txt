Oh, that girl can kill you with a smile
She'll see you coming from a mile
So don't leave nothing in your pocket. Po-po-pocket

Oh (oh)
Her kiss is like a rope and chain (chain)
She'll put poison in your brain
Ain’t nothing you can do to stop it.
Sto-sto-stop it

I want you to know
I'm telling you she's cold to her soul
Everything that glitter ain't gold,
Even though it's blinding.

She's a kleptomaniac (she'll steal your heart and soul)
Such a maniac (under her control)
Kleptomaniac.
Give your all, she wants more and more and more

Maniac [x6]

Oh (oh)
Where she's from they've got purple skies (skies)
And they come down here in disguise
She ain't the girl you should be trying, yeah

Oh (oh)
Her kiss is like a rope and chain (chain)
She'll put poison in your brain
Ain’t nothing you can do to stop it.
Sto-sto-stop it

I want you to know
I'm telling you she's cold to her soul.
And everything that glitter ain't gold, no
Even though it's blinding, oh

She's a kleptomaniac (she'll steal your heart and go)
Such a maniac (under her control)
Kleptomaniac.
Give your all and she wants more and more and more

Maniac [x6]

I want you to know
I'm telling you she's cold to her soul
And everything that glitter ain't gold,
Even though it's blinding.

She's a kleptomaniac (she'll steal your heart and go)
Such a maniac (under her control)
Kleptomaniac.
Give your all and she wants more and more and more

Kleptomaniac.
