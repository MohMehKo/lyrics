wuz goin on these niggaz out here wildin 
They Don't want won't beef, better run to police.
Better yet man you better keep quiet.
iguana seats inside it, I'm flying on auto pilot 
Deep in these streets, spittin crack on these beats.
But the word on the street is keep quiet. 
Me and my nigga tyga, patron got us wildin
Stereophone cup, throwing money in my clubs, oh you mad becuz I'm stylin. 
Crush diamonds on my amuelet 
Its lookin like a slush hoe. 
Niggaz meaning muggin, better keep that shit on hush mode. 
25 Kush blunts, I call dat shit a quarter 
Took her to my crib and make her strip like fishburne daughter 
I swag to hard too I do it like no other 
runnin round talkin tellin keep that undercover
