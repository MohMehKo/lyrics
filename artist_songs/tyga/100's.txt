Countin' hunnid, hunnid, hunnid, hunnids
Hunnid, hunnid, hunnid, hunnid, hunnid, hunnid hunnids
Runnin' through the set, runnin' up a check, runnin' through the bag
Countin' hunnid, hunnid, hunnid, hunnids
Money in the sack, money in the sky, money in the ceilings
Countin' hunnid, hunnid, hunnid, hunnids
We don't need no motherfuck' money machine
We like to touch it, touch it, touch it, touch it
In the club, throwin' racks and I got swag bustin' out the bag
(Countin' hunnid, hunnid, hunnid, hunnids)
T-Raww pulled up on me in a motherfuckin' Lamb
(Countin' hunnid, hunnid, hunnid, hunnids)
Jumpin' on my dick, jumpin' on my dick, jumpin' on my dick
'Cause I'm countin' hunnid, hunnid, hunnid, hunnids
We don't need no motherfuckin' money machine
We like to touch it, touch it, touch it

[Tyga:]
Runnin' up the set, throwin' up the set, bitches on set
Yeah, got bitches in the hallway
Dope in the stash, dope in the stash, hoes in the back
Yeah, that Ferrari just foreplay
Nigga put the swag, nigga put the cash, nigga put the bag
Yeah, everybody know me, bitch
Runnin' up a check, runnin' up a check
Techs with a tech if a nigga play me, bitch
Nigga, go that way, nigga, go that way
Bitches come this way, bitches wanna kiss me
Turn a freeway to a speedrace (Skrrt)
Don't be actin' shit about the fam
Don't be readin' shit in Daily Mail

Watch this shit sell like Adele, yeah

Niggas want beef but they Tofu
They like G.O.O.D. Music, baby, that's a good move
