[Hook x2: D-Lo]
Ayye Ayye, she used to fuck with my nigga, though
I don't care nigga, shit, I'mma get her tho
And when I get that ho, I'mma hit that ho
And when I hit that ho, I'mma forget that ho

[D-Lo]
After I hit her, I'mma quit her, on to the next
Gold rapper, latex, I practice safe sex
I'm Barry Bonds I hit the pussy on the first pitch
Boy, I murdered her, yeah I'm a murderer
Ayye, she used to fuck with my nigga
But he didn't want her, though, cause she didn't want ho
Rhinestones that's that fake shit
Man I'm realer then a bitch without a face lift
Dope dick, dope dick, that's what she yelling out
Dope dick, dope dick, that's what I'm giving out
Yeah your boy play bitches, like a PlayStation
And I'mma hit the first night girl I ain't patient

[Hook x2]

[Tyga]

Drop 350
I wake up, get up to fuck my bitch silly
I pop up and pop Royce and she pops one with me
The pussy so fire, I'mma need a chimney
Bought a bitch a Bentley; I'm playing
Tell a ho to follow my command (bitch)
Deep in that pussy, quicksand (bitch)
Better recognize I'm the man
Fuck her right I ain't playing, got these hoes on my hands
And they fucking at my shows, we just throw them in the van
Probably fuck and make a grand, I'mma throw another band
Ten, ten damn hoes at the same time
Fucking king gold chains

[Hook x2]

[Outro: D-Lo]
European photo, true religions and Polo
I'm leaning, off an 8 ounce of that syrup, that's the ocho
Look, I'm probably with your ho bro; getting dough, though
Replacing, never chasing, I don't care about no ho
