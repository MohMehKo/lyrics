[Verse 1]
Looking at the ceiling thinking why I treat you bad
Ain’t no worser feelings than knowing I did it for the last
Arguing, all I was doing accusing you, my bad
Said “Let’s take some time”, nevermind, rewind
Looking at the ceiling thinking why I treat you bad
Ain’t no worser feelings than knowing I did it for the last
Arguing, all I was doing accusing you, my bad
Said “Let’s take some time”, nevermind, just playing with your mind
I always thought “play dumb”, and let the other one love
Why? Get caught up in nowhere but trust
Only love for fun, I’m too young, I thought
All I wanted was a thanks to Louboutins I bought
But it ain’t your fault; heaven knows you deserve it all
You sent letters to my heart, but I burned them all
The Bible says before you run, gotta learn to crawl
But I don’t wanna waste time if we ain’t involved

[Hook]
Oh oh
We been through it all
I know I broke your heart once before
But I’m done
Oh oh ohh
Tell me what’s wrong
I know I never listen but just listen to this song
Oh man
I promise we gon’ do it til the sun come down
I swear it’s going down
I promise we gon’ do it til the sun come up
fuck it they don’t do it, we gon’ do it all

[Verse 2]
Now the ceiling fan spinning getting dizzy man
Wondering who she with maybe should I call — don’t be desperate man
This ain’t no “tag, you’re it” hide and seek shit
Reality just kicked in, I lost one and now she’s winning
Found another nigga she dig
Says he treat her like a queen but she probably control him
fuck that, I gotta get her back to what we started
Start over again this time my heart’s seeing honest-
Le-leave us, leave us let’s just talk about it
I know before I wasn’t much of a man about it
But this time I realize I can’t live without you
Believe when I say it’s true I love you

[Hook]
Oh oh
We been through it all
I know I broke your heart once before
But I’m done
Oh oh ohh
Tell me what’s wrong
I know I never listen but just listen to this song
Oh man
I promise we gon’ do it til the sun come down
I swear it’s going down
I promise we gon’ do it til the sun come up
fuck it they don’t do it, we gon’ do it all

[Bridge]
Love make you do it all
Going up and down like a seesaw
Can’t be a player forever dog
It feels so good but I know it’s wrong

Motherfucker drink what I’m sipping on
Motherfucker drink what I’m sipping on
Motherfucker drink what I’m sipping on
A bottle of love tell me if it’s too strong

[Hook]
Oh oh
We been through it all
I know I broke your heart once before
But I’m done
Oh oh ohh
Tell me what’s wrong
I know I never listen but just listen to this song
Oh man
I promise we gon’ do it til the sun come down
I swear it’s going down
I promise we gon’ do it til the sun come up
fuck it they don’t do it, we gon’ do it all
