[Chorus:]
[Pharrell:]
I know you wanna feel the girl (first time)
now take it easy the first time
first time, first time, first time, first time
first time, first time, first time
[Tyga:]
first time, I aint trying to hurt you now
but I think I’m in love for the first time
top 9 certified
but I think I’m love for the first time
top 9 certified
I think I’m love for the first time

[Tyga - Verse 1:]
First time I laid eyes
I looked around, heaven’s angel from the sky
it must be a message from God
cause you the only thing on my mind
let me show you why
tunnel of love let’s float inside
girl grab my hand now hold your ride
take a chance for life, roll the dice
next day we in paradise
promise to be loyal when honest
help out your family
with a couple dollars
I do my best for you
cause you my shorty
so rest your head on my shoulders
it feels good, don’t it baby

[Chorus]

[Tyga - Verse 2:]
I know you aint scared of tiger’s
I get around, they say my sex on fire (fire)
do it all night, keep you smiling
used to be a player but I’m retired
ugh, as I lay down right beside ya
no shirt, it’s kinda hard to be quiet
she said hold me close never let go
I got that good love girl, oh you didn’t know
uh, give ya kiss, ear to ya neck
relax, rub ya back
make it wet
I know love have you going crazy
but it feel good, don’t it baby

[Chorus]

[Pharrell - Bridge:]
Hey young girl, irl-ir-ir-irl-irl (wassup baby)
Hey young girl, irl-ir-ir-irl-irl (ever been in love)
Hey young girl, irl-ir-ir-irl-irl (I know you wanna feel it)
Hey young girl, irl-ir-ir-irl-irl

[Chorus]
