Look at how she walk, walk 
Like a rich girl 
Look at how she talk, talk 
Like a rich girl 
Lick your lips, blow a kiss 
Stop playing 
You's a Rich (Girl)

She so L.A., she there every day 
She like the scenery, I like to see her face 
It's a lazy day and I'm bored anyway 
So hit the freeway, chill with the boy bay 
That swag whirlwind gotta say
When she with me, she feel like beyonce 
Back in the day, used to rock the finger waves 
She much older now, but she don't even look her age 
Knew she get the dollars one day 
A good girl every day's like Sunday 
Only one way to her soul 
You don't need a flashlight, cause her heart glows 

Look at how she walk, walk, 
Like a rich girl 
Look at how she talk, talk 
Like a rich girl 
Lick your lips, blow a kiss 
Stop playing 
You's a Rich (Girl) [x2]

She called me on the way to her friend house 
You know home girl with the loud mouth 
She had a boyfriend but kicked the nigga out 
You saying she was cute too, you know what I'm talking bout 
Some chicks are the same, not her 
I just seen them all pop up, popped her 
Flying then I'm off to the next bird 
But this one right here nigga superb 
Scoop her then we listen to some Luther 
It's never too much, she know every word 
I'm like very good, and she's from the hood 
But she a rich girl, she can have the world 

Look at how she walk, walk, 
Like a rich girl 
Look at how she talk, talk 
Like a rich girl 
Lick your lips, blow a kiss 
Stop playing 
You's a Rich (Girl) [x2]

I'm looking for a rich girl, I'm looking for a rich girl 
I'm looking for a rich girl, So come here, come here girl [x2]

Look at how she walk, walk 
Like a rich girl 
Look at how she talk, talk 
Like a rich girl 
Lick your lips, blow a kiss 
Stop playing 
You's a Rich (Girl) [x2]
