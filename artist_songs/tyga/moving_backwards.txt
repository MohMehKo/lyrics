First scene, producers pointin' like action
As the chain swings, Lettin' shine no Sheen
Just my dream, Turn reality
Well done they say to me, How flatterin?
I'm just makin it work like batteries
Abuse and batter me, But never wanna challenge me
Leave em shiverin, Lookin in the mirror, like who can fuck with him?
Young troublesome, that the ladies love!
Packed show at the club, who said wait til 21?
Asked who booked, promoter didn't even look my way
Ha, ok
Party people doin what I say
Hands in the air pat ya belly that's enough ay
Just seein how much I can get away with
Lookin for a bird to get away with
Fly in my space ship
Take her back to where I live
Next to God crib
You ain't never been higher than this

Young hollywood star livin' lavish
Lookin back what a habit
Everybody like what happened?
Feel like I'm movin backwards
Tyga please show out for the camera
Now everythings flashin
Sittin here like what happened
Feel like I'm movin' backwards

Will your friends go
If u had to choose
International will we be travelin' til we old and blue
That's how family do
But what about if they didn't pay they dues
Well I guess I'll pay for that to
Accountant tellin me how much I withdrew
In the last past year or 2
Ain't gotta say it so loud, ya know
I'm just tryin to keep my people proud
I'm the one they countin' on to bring the members around
I ain't kiddin my mind is far from small child
I'm on some Mike Tyson shit up in the first round
Knock ya down, And then I smile
Throw in the towel
I'm so foul
X-rayin every girl blouse
Forgive me, I'm back calm now
Less energy
Late-ly
I don't know what's gotten in to me

Young hollywood star livin lavish
Lookin back what a habit
Everybody like what happened?
Feel like I'm movin backwards
Tyga please show out for the camera
Now everythings flashin
Sittin here like what happened
Feel like I'm movin backwards

My heart beats
Echoes into the cold streets
Where nightmares and darkness begin to meet
As I see
Nobody cares about my history
Not even me
Holdin tight to my rosary
I'm just hopin, someone notice me
Hopefully, Sign a cd
But right now, does it look to shabby T?
Look down cant even see my feet
Everythings blurry
But now, no more worries for me
Maybe go on Maury
As the rappers that used to be
These days they wont even accept me
Except me
Some excedrin
To get rid of conception
Drugs are a blessin
To someone with no breakfast, damn
It's so hard bein exited, out
Tryin to figure out
What my whole lifes: Been about
Cant even do that right
Will i ever see the light
We back in the limelight Mike

Young hollywood star livin lavish
Lookin back what a habit
Everybody like what happened?
Feel like I'm movin backwards
Tyga please show out for the camera
Now everythings flashin
Sittin here like what happened
Feel like I'm movin backwards
