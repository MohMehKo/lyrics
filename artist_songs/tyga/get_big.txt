Okayyy
It's too many bitches too many niggas hating
Red seat racing now my car name satan
Real simple you a bitch I got ya bitch naked
Chrome heart, hard to love, easier to hate me
I fucking hate clowns kill em like Jason
Burner, yea I Pac-trick like Swayze
Crazy cash bank roll roll cookoo mani
I rep California but not like Katy
Perry Middle school ghetto girls used to chase me
Now I'm big now they with me on the Ricther Scale baby
Put ya hands down fuck opponents and opinions
All the girls love me wrap my dick with a ribbon
Yeah I'm all business when I'm chillin we can kick it
My shoes are armadillos Louis Vuitton'n on you niggas
Spizzikes, Jays, Airwalkin on the flizzy
Gettin' head tight when ya high off in the Skizzy
Attendant say I'm tripping
You don't hear the captain speaking
I ball all week bitch you barely get weekends
Every show sold, promote it on twitter
Fresher than a baby got her standing the acryllic
Souvenir this motherfucker high school yea they did it
Best dressed ahhwww niggas ain't ahhhww shit to me
Dear Lord bring the Epiphany
Then let it rain hell flames on my enemies
Don't be gettin caught where you shouldn't be
Everything ain't a house party with the silly strings
Bring the b-b-beat the beat to the white meat
You niggas can't see me like mice feet
Head sprung one dose of me'll have your mind gone
Chaser with some blue ciroc now you in the cyclone
Lost in the ozone ain't you baby
100 things to do before you die lemme show you baby
Gotta watch ya back these days
Count a million in ya faces spend it in a day
Gotta watch ya back these days
Count a million in ya faces spend it in ya face Nigga
