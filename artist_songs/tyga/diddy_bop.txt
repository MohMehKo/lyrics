Shit

I approach it wit my nose lit
No scent
Since I'm gauranteed in the lead I'm in

Ball bottle buying,
Papi sick no medicine

Sippin the elegant swank
Walk like elephants

Smooth the scene
Canvas color is green
I don't move unless the car clean
Call me
Dial Money in between
the boss like Bosley
You wont see but you heard it's me
I'm one of the henches hurdel-in

Murderer
I murder them
This trophy my evidence
It's evident
Evidently niggas bitches full of Estrogen
In the corridor
Never bored
Get busy BITCH
Seven doors had that white whore on some corny shit

Tell em get that morgage
Morgan bring more in
forced into foursomes
Now she a TOP bitch
Cashed in
