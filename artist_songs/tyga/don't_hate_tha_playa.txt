Blam blam with them Nina, turn up like Tina
T raw in my speakers, she play with my balls like Venus
Cool nigga with a heater, hot shots of tequila
I can make you a star, put you in my features
Said I don't take no breaks
So all my money be even
I don't shop at Ikea
Got a beach house for the weekend
My bitch bad that's an understatement
Got a porno, might leak it
I Hail Mary to the deep end
I charge the pussy like defense
Crazy motherfucker
How you in that Benz and you ain't got cake?
Better use your legs, do what a pimp say
Even when I'm out of state, gotta keep em in they place
I be like, hit me motherfucker
Walk a day in my shadow, bet you won't last
Cause a nigga move fast, gotta get that cash
Riding in a Cadillac with a big old ass

[Hook]
Don't hate the player, cause your bitch chose me
Gettin super high, tryna stay low key
Suicide my doors, suicide my doors,
Bad bitch of the year, you should win an award
Don't hate the player, cause your bitch chose me
Gettin super high, tryna stay low key
Suicide my doors, suicide my doors,
Bad bitch of the year, you should win an award

I'm throwed again, I'm throwed again, I'm sippin lean
Got one gift, call her one gift
Cause she open up like Christmas Eve
She's doin dome, that's double-d's
I play chess on them double-d's
Hennessy, that's my drink
You don't drink? That's more for me more for me
Tell me when you see a nigga this fly, don't lie
Got a chauffeur cause the nigga don't drive
Tryna drink drive time on my lifetime pass that loud
Big beast and a nigga gonn feast
And I got a new chick, and I told her be easy
Runnin through a hundred racks, nigga, that's easy
It's too easy, believe me

Don't hate the player, cause your bitch chose me

Bad bitch of the year, you should win an award
Don't hate the player, cause your bitch chose me
Gettin super high, tryna stay low key
Suicide my doors, suicide my doors,
Bad bitch of the year, you should win an award

Do it real well, do it, do it real well
Applaud that ass cause you clap it real well
Clap it real well, clap it, clap it real well

Clap it, clap it real well
So go on, let me see you do it
Clap it, clap it real well
