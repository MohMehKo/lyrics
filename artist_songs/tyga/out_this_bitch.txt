Same old nigger making stuck in the day,
She the same since highschool back in the day,
Cute face, deep eyes, with the low beety ways,
Says she just finished school, now she worked at a bank,
Now I’m all in the bank, all in the bank, probably with some niggers that be rob in the bank,
Rob in the bank, now it’s all in the paper and she told me all about it, said I wanna see you later,
But I’m into deep, she said she’s got a nigger, but the nigger wakes
And I had a bitch, but she told me she’s too mean,
And I wanna see you, call me when the nigger leave.
You know I’d be right back over, spend the night over,
Mixing me a cup, she don’t like being sober,
In love with a man, so she says, is getting late,
Can’t stay, now we are back arguing.

She say I'm trynna make this work, you're doin' it again
Fuck this shit, I'm out this bitch
Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch)
Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch)
Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch)
She tell me
"you could have that bitch, you ain't bout shit, fuck this shit, I'm out this bitch"
She like "fuck that shit"
She got me like "fuck that bitch!"
Say I'm out this bitch...

Now I’m right back in the same position, with the same bitch that I said I was quitting a minute ago,
I’m out of control, over these hoes, dealing with emotions I don’t wanna show,
It’s like one or two flaws, don’t wanna be involved with her at all
Tired of waiting, I’m getting impatient, she is lately with her best friend and the head game’s crazy,
Single now, living life while I’m on a deadly
Ain’t got time for no sorry, just brought a Ferrari,
Cost me two eighty, now these bitches wanna call me by my real name.
Baby, ain’t got time for no motherfucking questions,
To my ex’s, hope you learned your lesson.
While you’re out stressing I’m somewhere out sexing,
On to the next one, on to the next thing,
No, you ain’t tripping.
All on your TV, now she wanna text me.

She say I'm trynna make this work, you're doin' it again
Fuck this shit, I'm out this bitch
Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch)
Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch)
Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch)
She tell me
"you could have that bitch, you ain't bout shit, fuck this shit, I'm out this bitch"
She like "fuck that shit"
She got me like "fuck that bitch!"
Say I'm out this bitch...

Say I’m out this bitch, say I’m out this bitch.
