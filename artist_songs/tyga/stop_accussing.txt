Ah
City lights dark shades with my vision light
Salute Moet with glass got me feeling right
Do not miss ice, all I need ms right tonight
Too clean one beam I ain't finna fight
One hit probably in a life. Life just cold, hell, so I bring the fire
Almighty in the sky, no this ain't angel eyes
Eyes must say [?] fly, fly, must oblige. I give text, she read, reply
Some good sex after this thinking in my mind. took a look at the time
Sweet 10:25. meet me, couple drinks, eat, no ramadan
Bed spread. take the covers off
Drag your ass on the comforter, dracula, get to sucking on
Uck you from behind, fuck you hard, fuck dat other sucka ma
Blood rush through your theighs like your running around
Its finna get wild while I beat it like a problem child
Probaly deep down world pussy treasure found
I'm thinking two more rounds I'mma tap out...
But I ain't let it out...its getting wetter now...
She need a paper towel. don't pull it out
Ahhhh like your smile

Answer your phone. hello? (wuddup)
Pick up your phone, are you cheating?
(are you cheating on me) answerable
Your wrong. (I think your wrong) I've been with you this whole weekend
Stop Stop. Stop Stop Stop accussing. Stop Stop
Stop Stop Stop accussing. Stop Stop. Stop Stop Stop accussing (damn she make me wanna lose it)
Stop Stop. Stop Stop Stop accussing. Stop Stop. Stop Stop Stop accussing
Stop Stop. Stop Stop Stop accussing (damn she make me wanna lose it)

A couple months pass and I'm still in that ass
Everyday we in the sheets like the Klu Klan
Next in the streets, arguing, she think I cheat
Just cause I'm busy? I just think she love me...
But she don't wanna be in love
Cause all her friends tell her remember how that nigga was?
And things that he done, to each and every girl?
Just imagine on tour a bunch of--bitches shutup!
They don't know shit about us, famous
I can pay them to play naked. can I
Watch a stipper put dollar bills on her anus. angry
I'm just keeping it real, don't you hate it?...
What I'm sayin, is that ain't me
We can get away while their aiming
Sea shores relaxe like you fainting but its like the world changing..
And..you..changing..wit it. but I don't wanna waste your minutes(minutes)
Because every moment's precious (precious)
Look at all the shit we blessed wit, benz's, houses, necklaces, correct me if this isn't wat u wanted
I like to see us peaceful in the public
Hugging. people like look at that couple
But you don't wanna none of it so fuck you and fuck it
