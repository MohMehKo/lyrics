Benzo, batman, big hoe, lap dance
Ass so fat need a lap dance
Ass so fat I need a lap dance
Benzo, batman, big hoe, lap dance
Ass so fat need a lap dance
Ass so fat I need a lap dance

[Verse 1]
Shit straight killer, Max Payne, Travis Porter, make it rain
Young Money gang, put you on the team
All my bitches fly, put you on a plane
Hundreds in your face, why you broke boy?
Not from Chi city but I make the Illinois
Let your pride gone walk it out
In the bank and I’m only cashing large amounts
One, one, two, two bitch what it do? three, four, drop it to the floor
five, five, six, six, rub her on the tits
Seven, seven, eight, eight, make that ass shake

[Hook]
Benzo, batman, thick hoe, lap dance
Ass so fat need a lap dance
Ass so fat I need a lap dance
Benzo, batman, big hoe, lap dance
Ass so fat need a lap dance
Ass so fat I need a lap dance

[Verse 2]
It’s raining ass and titties, yeah, ass and titties
If you ain’t throwing money, mind your fucking business
Floss like a dentist, Dennis the menace
Room of crazy niggas, probably get a life sentence
Sharper than a tac, attack and bite you bitches
Swagga jack and biting on like you niggas
Like conscious rappers, mad cause we winning
Snug long nose call it Scottie Pippen
Ahh, got like 200k large, in the back seat of my car
Like Cialis I go hard, motherfucker
One, one, two, two bitch what it do? three, four, drop it to the floor
five, five, six, six, rub her on the tits
Seven, seven, eight, eight, make that ass shake

[Hook]

Make it, make it, make it clap
Make it, make it, make it clap
Make it, make it, make it clap
Make it, make it, make it clap

One, one, two, two bitch what it do? three, four, drop it to the floor
five, five, six, six, rub her on the tits
Seven, seven, eight, eight, make that ass shake

[Hook]
