Uh, 9th grade used to play hooky
Told your bitch I'll pass when I drop pussy
I don't need your pussy, I get too much pussy
Fucked her in the kitchen, kept the food cooking.
Uh, 22 young millionaire crib in Bel Air, all the bitches stare
... you should cup a pair
No house phone cause I'm never fair!
I fucked her best friend and I saw love
Cause I get her best friends all in the club
Niggas pulled up, bitches all drugged
And all she wanna do is fuck with a thug.
