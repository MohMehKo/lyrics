[Chorus x2]
I don’t know what to do
Sitting here alone just waitin’ on a queue
‘Cause I don’t wanna fuck with you, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more
I don’t wanna fuck with you

Man falling into love too deep
Too much pressure
I don’t want to feel too weak
You be hearin’ all these bitches just talkin’ ‘bout me
And if it’s about beef
You’ll take it to the street
I know I see you don’t want to be seen
But baby I’m a star
And this is my team
I work too hard to be arguing 
Picking up my phone and it ain’t even ringing
We even got some issues,
Some problems of your own
But I ain’t going to put you out there on the song
I’d be wrong if I did,
Even talkin’ about a kid
What my past relationships that’s false information
Bitch I thought you knew me better then that
Never did, matter fact
I don’t really got time to be explaining that
I know shit ain’t the same
But sometimes niggas goin’ change
Change now.

[Chorus]
I don’t know what to do
Sitting here alone just waitin’ on a queue
‘Cause I don’t wanna fuck with you, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more
I don’t wanna fuck with you

Tired of that, ain’t calling back
Ain’t fucking with you
Like the virgins back
Man shit was all good just a week ago
Now I’m blowing up
Turn me up in your speaker hoe
Speaking on the wrong shit
Now you gotta go
Sick of yo face and your friend is the antidote
And I ain’t trying to go fuck with anybody
But Imma fuck around and fuck somebody
Like bullets on plate
Rounds new pussy I just found
Out down late out
Throw in the towel ow
When I met this late
Probably never press redial
Calling all your loud ass friends in the background
I’m better now, I’m better now
Gotta new bitch I ain’t goin’ put her out
HA, like I put you out
This time I ain’t playing around

[Chorus]
I don’t know what to do
Sitting here alone just waitin’ on a queue
‘Cause I don’t wanna fuck with you, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more
I don’t wanna fuck with you
