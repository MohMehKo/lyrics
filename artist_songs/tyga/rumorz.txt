Rumor has it that I'm armed
Somebody should have told them
When the cash starts flowing and the hands start reaching
You read the contract your man ain't breaching
Uh, and rumor has it
The jeweler wants his money
But I'm out here rocking all my chains, real chunky
Real comfy, and rumor has it when I hit the club hoes go dummy
And rumor has it, I'm doing magic
David Blaine, diamonds in the hat trick
Rumor has it, thought you had it
How is that true when I have it?
Yeah, yeah

You start to see shit, start to believe shit
Can't read me, cause you believe what you read bitch
And rumor has it I need you for me to make it happen
You believe that shit, you really smoking crack then
Came up from a small room packed in
Used to drink out the tap, now I'm tapped in
And rumor has it I'mma die rich
