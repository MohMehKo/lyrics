[Tyga]
Pussy talkin' like...
Pussy talkin' like...
Well done

Aye babe, why you puttin' us on display
Bringing up old shit in front of all our friends
And trying to start to day with arguments
Trying to relax like parliaments
We doing the opposite
Textin' keshia like man I think this nigga be cheatin'
I'm late working 
I know I didn't come home that evening
Calling my phone,
Attitudes, heavy breathing
I mean whats the reason 
Or is it that your menstrual speakin' hah
I ain't gamin' just tired of fakin'
No patience be a rider like aliz√©
Thomas Clay Aiken no gay shit
Ass naked, commando baby
She got my dick motivated

[Chorus]
Now we wakin' up middle of the night
Fuckin' make up right after we fight
Pussy talkin' like...
Well done
Pussy talkin' like...
Well done

Man she always wakin' up middle of the night
Fuckin' make up right after we fight
Pussy talkin' like...
Well done
That pussy talkin' like...
Well done

[Tyga]
Uhh lay it down bend it over like strippers open
Water gun big shoot you
Now you super soakin'
Comin' down your chimmey
Call it santa workin'
I brought some gifts for you
Mango flavored lotion
Wetter then a loofah
Lube you on your momma's sofa
Stretch it out rosa acosta
I do this shit have you comin' over and over
Again like a maid service clean her perfect
I ain't perfect
Most of them bitches don't deserve me
Had my moments but most them bitches all be thirsty
They ain't worth it
Block 'em all like stage curtains
Knock 'em off like fake purses
I ain't trickin' but you got it
Loving you being honest 
Hard to be honest but most of the time you indecisive
I'm tired of fighting
Let it go close your eye lids
Open the morning fresh and we vibin'

[Chorus]
Now we wakin' up middle of the night
Fuckin' make up right after we fight
Pussy talkin' like...
Well done
Pussy talkin' like...
Well done

Man she always wakin' up middle of the night
Fuckin' make up right after we fight
Pussy talkin' like...
Well done
That pussy talkin' like...
Well done
Finish him!
