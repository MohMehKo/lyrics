Odd Well Done
Odd Well Done

[Verse 1]
Fuckin Ric Flair leglock
Headshot, body cropped
Make his fuckin mama watch
Squeeze your baby inside a fuckin
Baby bottle pop. Risky top
Running through your blood til your kidneys pop
Pillow-talk, leave your lips on top of your pillowtop
Pop you while your roof off
On top of a rooftop. Oswald, Mankind
All you niggas getting socked
Loto Wap rock it til your burger leave the lettuce out
Check this out, no one around
Put your face into my crotch
Give a lick, lollipop, frog-tongue on my cock

Odd Well Done
Odd Well Done

[Verse 2]
There's dead mammals in my living room
Louis minks, foxtails, doper than a metal spoon
Ay fool, split your enchilada, now its wormfood
Moving like worms move
Burn you like perms do
One two, leader of the Rat Pack tat crew
Hat's removed, when I walk in room
Make her eyes twitch
Juke ya, cut your shit out like a coupon
In due time, reign of a new king
Well Done
