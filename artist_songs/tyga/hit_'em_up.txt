[Hook: Tyga]
I said fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, nigga I hit em up

[Verse 1: Tyga]
T Raww go stay Westside, killa cat pillar,
No ceiling, probably worth 10 million
Poor nigga watch chilla, you ain't even gotta feel it
That's chin chinchilla flyer than a caterpillar
I sick my dogs at you, yeah
Then call the dog catcher, bitch
Spark the fire, no matches, yeah
So high just laughing, hah
Burners in the attic, they ain't know I had it
Shoot sporadic, fire automatic, pop the target
Driving backwards, I'm a hundred bill fanatic
Bring the static, make vows to the money, but I skipped marriage
Keep staring, rather die that nigga than live average, get you embarrassed
Thousand karats on my wheel let my kids inherit
Black card credit, told them I don't use debit
Nigga know that's my motto, I could do this shit forever so

[Hook: Tyga]
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, talkin get you hit up

Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, nigga I hit em up

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
We don't rock with them niggas anyway, fuck them
We'd ever caught them in the hood, we'd a stuck them
Things coming in, we get them off by the dozen
We about that action, you ain't about nothin'
Girl of your dream, I already had her
If it ain't my team, it don't really matter
Short stay, I'm only in town for the figures
Even when I'm up, I'm still down for my niggas
Need nothing else, don't concern me or worry me
Nah, I'mma ride 'til they burn me or bury me
Cause the truth is, niggas die every day
Heard about me, I hope you heard thoroughly
I don't switch sides, I just switch rides
Might just get a little head, let the bitch slide
Knowing that I can, knowing that I will
Far as the other side go, you know how I feel

[Hook: Tyga]
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, talkin get you hit up

Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, nigga I hit em up

[Verse 3: 2Pac & Tyga]
[2Pac]
You gotta watch your back
Stay strapped, be alert
Started as a young motherfucker doin' dirt
Walkin' through the streets wearin' jewels
[Tyga] Ain't got shit to lose
Gonna fuck up and bust young niggas with tools
[2Pac] The intricate designs of my lethal lines
[Tyga] Now time hard to find a job, easier to rob niggas
[2Pac] These days, motherfuckers talk shit
And turn snitch when you see 'em
They ain't talkin' 'bout shit
Westside
I keep a vest on my chest
Buck, buck, cops wanna hit me with the book
[Tyga] But I don't give a fuck
Government got a nigga feelin' stuck
While these same little sluts gettin' fucked
For a quick buck
Weed make my mind roam
[2Pac] All alone, ain't nothin' like tryin' to bone
Over the phone, in my mind I can see her naked
I can't take it
Got me shakin' at the thought that we can make it
I thought you knew
Get loaded, can't control it
Nigga, pass me the blunt and let me roll it
[Tyga] Then smoke it, sippin
[2Pac] Hennessy
[Tyga] Plottin' on my enemies
'Comin back twice as hard
Like, remember me
[2Pac] My hustle to my dyin' days
[Tyga] Niggas dyin' every day
And we celebrate with pain
Pourin' champagne
Drink politics, they wanna join my campaign
Worldwide, LA niggas screaming
[2Pac] Westside

[Hook: Tyga]
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, talkin get you hit up

Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, nigga I hit em up
