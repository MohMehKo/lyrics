It's Tyga, bitch. (Oh oh oh)
Yeah, Tyga-man, Gator, GED. 
'07's been a great year.
And uh, '08's gonna be a better one.

[Tyga:]
Hey, hey, what's going on in the world today?
Can it be a way I pronounce my age?
Like, hey lil' mama, 
Come my way,
Heard you clean up good, baby, 
Be my maid,
Oh, you got a tarp?
Black? Silver car,
Pick one, plenty room in my shopping cart, 
But no piece of meat can hurt my heart,
Translate: I'm in a veggie-race, 
All I eat is green-colored cake, 
If I fade away, 
It'd be the last thing that I ate,
Oh my my, 
Dollar signs, 
It's alive! 
Frankenstein!
Tyga, 
I'm, 
Einstein,
Rappin' crimes, 
Flier guy,
I'm make them angels tired, 
My whip talk,
Baby like look at my fucking dial! 

[Chorus] 
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every,
Every day,
I'm,
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every, 
Every day,
I'm,
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every,
Every day,
I'm,
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every,
Every dollar

[Gator:]
Hey, yo, how you doing? My name is Gator
All around the room, I be gettin' that paper,
Boy oh boy, I like to spin this, 
chick, and the tin it,
then I kicked it,
I pa-poo-pa-pa for that spinach,
and it makes you feel like I'm trippin,' (I'm not)
'Cause you ain't taking the trips I'm trippin,' (I'm over here)
No nightmares, everyday is Christmas,
I'll buy you what you want, bitch,
Lay off the shit-list,
I'm gettin' and gettin,'
And don't you forget this,
Every dollar that I see, 
While my niggas pop bottles in the VIP,
'Cause you don't know no better,
But to get that cheddar,
Hauntin' every day,
Yeah, that's forever
Money, money, money,
Yeah, that's my schedule,
You talk too cheap,
You talk to ever

[Chorus] 
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every,
Every day,
I'm,
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every, 
Every day,
I'm,
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every,
Every day,
I'm,
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every,
Every dollar

[Tyga:]
The song is not over.
We just have to take a quick intermission.
Whoo, tired.
[Music stops]
Bring it back.
[Music resumes]

[Chorus] 
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every,
Every day,
I'm,
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every, 
Every day,
I'm,
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every,
Every day, (Oh, oh)
I'm,
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every,
Every dollar (Oh)

Every,
Every day,
I'm,
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every,
Every day, 
I'm,
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every,
Every day, (Oh, oh)
I'm,
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every,
Every dollar

[Tyga:]
I'm getting every dollar,
I could do it with eyes closed,
And I'm waiting on this check to come,
When it get here motherfuckers going crazy,
Like the thousand-year ten-thousand-aire,
I ain't hurtin' no-one when I put it in the air,
Them just self-made out of your age,
Tell the old-head to go to bed,
'Cause I don't hear your marketing highness,
I hear cheese when I sing,
Why Z, is your skill grade of a G?
I'm still on tour,
Haters, you know where to find me,
Haters, you know where to find me,

(Hey, you know this ain't right, Tyga.
This ain't right, man.)

Gettin,' gettin,'
Every,
Every dollar
