[Birdman]
The young king... the lil homie Tyga
It's yo turn, nigga... it's yo turn, playboy
West Coast stand up to this Careless World, people
Global flying on this journey...
Tropical islands, poppin' bottles with supermodels...
Blowing up the pounds (sunup to sundown)...
Flying at higher heights... grinding hard...
Money by the abundance...
Yeah, YMCMB flashy life...
What it do, young king... it's yo turn, boy...
