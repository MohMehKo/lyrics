[Chorus: Patty Cash]
Diamond Life
Sugar baby we dynamite
Playboy and socialites
Young and Fly Fly Fly

[Verse 1: Tyga]
1989 no pressure
But to be the bestest in my section
Levels of a professional
Skip school create my own lessons
Confessions of a mad rapper
Music got me rapping
Green stretching only leads to red stretches
He's next in line for the blessing
Get your mind off minds
Hustle something and stop relying on mine
More then a legend why you letting time fly by
At age 17 addicted to ink
A rap fein who had money dreams
My chase of fame couldn't compare to what I seen
Them die government lie hard for the paper cheese
Moms crying watching her only son
Through TV mtv bet
He on now wipe me down
No longer fighting through the crowd
I control the crowd oh you like me now wow!

[Chorus: Patty Cash]
Diamond Life
Sugar baby we dynamite
Playboy and socialites
Young and Fly Fly Fly
Diamond Life
Sugar baby we dynamite
Playboy and socialites
Young and Fly Fly Fly

[Verse 2:]
Back to the cool motivational roads
No guidance just violence in probational homes
Thinking my high routes is all out
Music gotta be my way out
Family gathered around I gotta make em proud
Pops popped in the penatenary laided out
Hoping his son fell under a different cloud
I'm speaking directly into the crowd
Nothing personal
Just thought you would love to know the person
Far from perfect
But nearly word perfect
Must be he weighed him
On a scale form 1 to me, me
Even the greatness
Money equal a every 10 haters
The rest couldn't make it though the unlikely behavior
So be patient
Or end up the next patient
Emergency room, newspaper
The new rappers call em street actors
Music wise they playing safety
And I'm shooting on safety aiming for greatness

[Chorus: Patty Cash]
Diamond Life
Sugar baby we dynamite
Playboy and socialites
Young and Fly Fly Fly

Sugar baby we dynamite
Playboy and socialites
Young and Fly Fly Fly Fly

Now every body where you game face
Forget it everybody just do what he say
They wanna move like they wanna be like
You can do it just like like, like

Now every body where you game face
Forget it everybody just do what he say

Cash staking like Tetris
It's youthful effervesces
No herme arsenals

Get the message (got diamonds)
I'm getting cream like a nestle
Welcome from Compton getting
