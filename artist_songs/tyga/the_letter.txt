Tell me when to stop... [x4]
Tell me when to stop... [x4]

[Bridge: Esty]
In the haze we lose, conscious of it all
In the haze we fall, could of had it all
In the haze we lose, conscious of it all
In the haze we lose, conscious of it all

[Verse 1: Esty]
To be honest, I know now
You don't just see, it's not the way you planned it in your mind
I know you do, I know you do
In all honesty there's a time and place you could let me know I'll listen,
I know what to do, you know what to say, tell me what it is you feel
Don't be shy, don't be shy

[Hook: Esty]
I'm testing you like you testing me
I'm testing you while you testing me, I know
I'm testing you like you testing me (Oooh I)
I'm testing you like you testing me,
I know (I know, I know)
I know (I know)
I know (I know)
I know it and you know it that I know
I know (I know)

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, watching the stars
On a yellow brick road like the Wizard of Oz
Ain't no workin titles for this little thing of ours
I tell you the game like I'm Robert Steiner
Put roses on my neck, rose petal massages
I kiss you down low but I let you decide
I get behind you like you're making dirty wine
Get you a glass of muscato, that's yo favorite wine
And I... know
Can't hold yo prop cause it's yours
Like Versace models you'll be dipped in leather
You my bread and butter, let's toast
And I... hope
Like Shepard's Fairey we can fly canaries
Obey my presence, you are a blessing
I am a reverend so start confessing

[Bridge: Esty]
In the haze we lose, conscious of it all
In the haze we fall, could of had it all
In the haze we lose, conscious of it all
In the haze we lose, could of had it all

[Hook: Esty]
I'm testing you like you testing me
I'm testing you while you testing me, I know
I'm testing you like you testing me (Oooh I)
I'm testing you like you testing me,
I know (I know, I know)
I know (I know)
I know (I know)
I know it and you know it that I know
I know (I know)
