My nigga, I've been down for a minute
And I've been tryna make my way home
You know I've been down for a minute
My way home, my way home
You know I've been down for a minute
And I've been tryna make my way home
You know I've been down for a minute
My way home, my way home
I've been rollin' with 'em hitters
And I done got way, way, way strong
And niggas wanna rob me, she wanna rob me
But I be on my way home

And I be ridin' wit her, I rhyme wit her
I take her where homie can't go
And I be state to state wit her, stay wit her
And niggas actin' like they don't know
But baby watchin' all that shit though
When you get the fame, that's how things goes
And everybody talk that talk though
But when the money talks, we can talk more

You know I've been down for a minute
And I've been tryna make my way home
You know I've been down for a minute
My way home, my way home
I've been down with 'em hitters
And I done got way, way, way strong
And niggas wanna rob you, she wanna rob you
But I be on my way home

You know I be on the map and I be on an app
I swear to god I'm all of that, I'm on to you
And what you want, I ain't comin' back, I ain't comin' back
I swear to god I'm ain't comin' back, don't wait for you
You know it's all love, heart attack, heart attack
I told the money where my heart at, no comin' back
And niggas take that money though
Niggas take that money though (I know I did)
And now I'm formed with no assist
Spend the gain with my main bitch
Comin' down in that lane switch
Stuntin' now on these lame niggas
What the fuck ya name is, don't care what ya name is
And I be on a same Glock with the same Glock
I ain't the same now, I ain't the same now and she know

You know I've been down for a minute
And I've been tryna make my way home
You know I've been down for a minute
My way home, my way home
I've been rollin' with 'em hitters
And I done got way, way, way strong
And niggas wanna rob me, she wanna rob me
But I be on my way home

And I be, goddamn, almost everyday
Not a faint on me now when you fade away
Tell me, is you down from him, you down from me
I don't trust that, I'm over that, I'm done with that
I'm like fuck that, I love you and fuck that, I need you
I took you 'round the globe and back
Matter fact, to Rome and back, I can tell you need that

Cause baby, you've been down for a minute
And you've been tryna make your way home
Baby, you've been down for a minute
Your way home, your way home
You've been rollin' with 'em hitters
And you done got way, way, way strong
And now they wanna rob you, she wanna rob me
But we be on our way home

Whenever you get lost
Just remember I will always be there to guide you
Listen to the sound of my voice
My love will always be your light
Darkness will always follow the brightest star
Our dreams are what make who we are
The world's yours, Tyga
