[Intro:]
I don't give a fuck
{Tyga tyga tyga nice to see you}

[Tyga:]
Young Nino, fuck a bitch in a pea coat
Carlito, Scarface, AL Pacino
Bun B do, Pimp C, R-PIDO though
I goes deep in that pussy, Dan Marino
She wanna be the one, fuck her to my own single
Break a bitch heart, no future miss cleo
Snap back, au-au-automatic reload
Flyer than a fucking beatle, you can't beat 'em
Vampire fuck up your evening
I pop up and eat lunch, leave you in the cement
Don't believe it, stripe like a fucking Adidas
The gun selena, give a nigga bieber fever

Real fucking hot, put it in park
Take a shot, higher than a tube sock
You a bop, give me top top, as I load the guap
Man these niggas say I'm fly but to her I'm god

[Hook:]
I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded

And I don't give a fuck

[Tyga:]
Fuck is up, nigga's stomping in my chucks
Yeah, I make it rain, dear, cause I'm all about my bucks
Use the butt I'm in the front, dick up in her cunt
And I put it in her hole, hole in one, putt putt (wahhhhhh)

Super McNasty, why you McLoving
When the bitch call me daddy
Pimp no caddy, she wish she never had me
Treat her like a dog, called the bitch lassy
Young savvy, bang her like Cincinnati
Above average, fly like I'm Aladdin
They bend backwards, throw the pussy at them
I'm Ben Wallace, dunk up in your basket

Balls in the air, no games,
I'm serious, double dare
There's too many bitches,
Why these niggas wanna stare
Patron up in here
Nigga this ain't no beer

[Hook:]
I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded

And I don't give a fuck

[Lil' Wayne:]
Mama, there go that monster
Abracadabra, magic Johnson
My motherfucking doctor
Said I need a doctor
So I called house,
Now I am a pill popper
Faded like skinnys
Young money we winning
I told her if I change
She won't get a penny
Milking that shit, pregnant bitch titties
Bringing home the bacon
I'm fucking miss piggy
Loaded like a semi, semi-naked pictures
She knows my dick, she call it nigga Richard
Prior to me cummin, I had to stick my thumb in
Her ass one time, smell my finger make you vomit
Flyer than a hornet, the shoe fit I worn it
She tried to jack me off, can't beat it, join it
Tunechi, coochie that what she call it,
Flag Scarlett, I killed it, mourn it

[Hook:]
Faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
[Lil Wayne:] Young Moolah baby!
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded

And I don't give a fuck
