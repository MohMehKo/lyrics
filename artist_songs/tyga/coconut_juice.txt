Put the lime in the coconut and twist it all up [x3]

Twist it all up
Twist it all up

Everybody in the party
Hold your cup high move your body
If you twist it scream it loudly!

Ay, ay, ay, HEY ay, ay, ay, HEY

[Chorus:]
Coconut juice got me real loose
Like, got me leaning 3 thousand proof like
Coconut juice all on the dance FLOOR
Fellas let your ladies GO ladies let your Fellas GO

COME back, went straight to the club
Entrance no charge cause we late to the club
Uumm yes, we'll stand in the club
GE D on the couch pouring drinks on the rug
What a mess, but we cleanin the club
Ice so bright make a fight scene in the club
Don't test, cause their beams in the club
Red beams in the club leave your jeans full of blood

[Chorus:]
Coconut juice got me real loose
Like, got me leaning 3 thousand proof like
Coconut juice all on the dance FLOOR
Fellas let your ladies GO ladies let your Fellas GO

Put the lime in the coconut and twist it all up [x3]

Twist it all up
Twist it all up

And he said, I'm getting every dollar on G E D

So coat it, an I'm up in this thing with my thing
An she shaking that thing her momma gave her.

[Chorus:]
Coconut juice got me real loose
Like, got me leaning 3 thousand proof like
Coconut juice all on the dance FLOOR
Fellas let your ladies GO ladies let your Fellas GO

Put the lime in the coconut and twist it all up [x3]

Twist it all up
