How you gon hate on me in the club? Nigga I ain’t even in the club! Haha

[Verse 1]
Killa nigga, last king roll up on ‘em in a Bentley
Mothafucka, gorilla, go getter, hoe getter
Hoe nigga better hold yours nigga
I’m sick, throw up, throw up this liquor
Mo’ money I got it
Bitches ain’t problems not to me
Yeah they bout it, Master P so many albums on release
Shit in my closet, Louboutan and bloody bottoms
Bitches spot em yeah I’m stylin
Tyga pilot, fly no mileage yeah I put them bitches on it
California man, gold on my license plate
Ladies’ man, baby I know what them bitches like

[Chorus]
Little mic, mike n ikes, candy color cover ice
Outta sight, outta mind
She gon spend the night but don’t waste my time
I’m 2 miles away from the Hollywood sign
King of the hill nigga don’t look down
Probably at Polo house right now
All these bitches on the prowl

[Verse 2]
Look at my flow look at my eyes
Tell me what you see don’t lie
Mo’fuckin G R to the E A to the T EST
Last king look at my ring tell that bitch get off my thing
My girl ain’t here and she off that drink
I’m off that mink
Fur murder swervin’ make the jet ski do a hurdle
You’s a motherfuckin turtle knock you down like Berto
Straps on my side like Urkle, boy I’ll hurt you
Turn your face purple
Niggas wanna talk but your convo worthless
These converse yeah all black chuckers
I’m that nigga, you just a nigga
One more year, yeah I’ma be bigger
Don’t call me Tigga, jack the ripper
Rip these beats then I eat you for dinner
I’m done!
