T Y G A

Zippin', dippin' jabs super fast in a flash
It's Tygaman, Tygaman
Tatted up on my mask, superhero for the cash
It's Tygaman, Tygaman

My life is, my life is like a cartoon y'all
More crazier than, shh, you ever saw
I fume to the left and fume to the right and
Then I'm g-g-gone

Meet me, the Looney Tune 17 from the CPT
Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy couldn't beat me in more D's
Roll 22's on the whip, they call them
Fantastic Fours and shh, whoa I'm sick

Introducing, Billy the Kid
Space jammin' with Banana's In Pajamas
No homo, excuse my manners
I go from Hulk to David Banner

Land of bandannas
They Yosemite Sam ya, ya Fugazi like
Two Stupid Dogs' talkin' as they walkin'
I couldn't believe that, shh, oops I almost slipped

Porkey Pig dollar bills
Plus Tweety Bird sits on my wrist
Man, warning, you'll get booked like Orbitz
Your corpses will be with Yogi in the forest

Quick reminder on short notice
I got the swag potion
Take a sip until you're no longer sober

My life is, my life is like a cartoon y'all
More crazier than shh you ever saw
I fume to the left and fume to the right and
Then I'm g-g-gone

My life is, my life is like a cartoon y'all
More crazier than shh you ever saw
I voom to the left and voom to the right and
Then I'm g-g-gone

Stand down, we have a man down
I, Tasmanian devil in my bezel
The ice so heavy Bam Bam couldn't lift my pebbles
The Flintstones say the stones make you flint as you stare in it

Ridiculous bright with a little glare in it
The light beams off it like The Power Puff Girls who stare at it
My spaceship come equipped with a Jetson engine
To the milky way I'm dippin'

Bravo Johnny says, we're space pimpin'
With the huh, huh, ha, I always get 'em
The grill lookin' Ojish but not Simpson
I'm more like blue and yellow mixed, Marge Simpson

You lil' countin' chickens
Scooby Doo can't even figure out what Tyga's missin'
Maybe nothin', there's gotta be something
To rap, he's like carrots to Bugs Bunny
With cash I'm the Energizer Bunny, long money

My life is, my life is like a cartoon y'all
More crazier than shh you ever saw
I fume to the left and fume to the right and
Then I'm g-g-gone

My life is, my life is like a cartoon y'all
More crazier than shh you ever saw
I voom to the left and voom to the right and
Then I'm g-g-gone

Zippin', dippin' jabs super fast in a flash
It's Tygaman, Tygaman
Tatted up on my mask, superhero for the cash
It's Tygaman, Tygaman
