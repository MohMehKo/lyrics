[Chorus]
T-raww, T-raww, T-raww, T-raww
I don’t give a fuck at all
T-raww, T-raww, T-raww, T-raww
I don’t give a fuck at all

[Verse 1]
Last King, Golds on My colar bone fresh
Got that immortal technique flow
Tech N9ne’s, tech decks
Finger boards flip a bitch
Thailand pick a bitch
Its my land I take a shit anywere, skat and piss
Lazereth king of the the snapback habitat
Flashback..flash bangs leave you fucken trapped
Leave you face swoll leave a cabbage pach punching bag
Doctor Seuss niggas you’s a pussy cat in a hat
Rolling that papers like wiz papers
Cash takers put you in a cast cuz your pocket’s breaking
The heart breaker, fuck her once never date her
The Money chaser, no chase fuck a savings
I got that ready, jelly, spread it to all my niggas
So they spend it spend it like ring a round the rosie
Okie dokey got a bad Spanish bitch like Kobe
The most low key
Nigga you don’t know me
I'm…..

[Chorus]
T-raww, T-raww, T-raww, T-raww
I don’t give a fuck at all
T-rawww, T-rawww, T-rawww, T-rawww
I don’t give a fuck at all

[Verse 2]
Like Cam Newton I’m number 1
Hand picked my hand guns
Ima cowboy like marion
Barber cut your hair for fun
02 I’m on one
105 to Compton
YG just hit me said these bitches got these tatts done
With my name on em
That’s a damn shame
Cuz I changed homie
I changed my damn name
To T-raw, don’t look at me
Get chopped like butcher meat
Gold chains like Mr. T
Your girl face in my toilet seat (haha)
My niggas they be trippin
Yo shit weak but boi you ain't different
My show sold your show ?
Ya’ll mini me’s, I’m prolific
I progress, no stress
More sex she gon give it
No Robin Gibbons
I fucked that hoe
Nas fucked that hoe
Sleeping on me don’t you ever get to comfortable
Young Money...
Last King...
When you see me coming call me by new name

T-raww, T-raww, T-raww, T-raww
I don’t give a fuck at all
T-raww, T-raww, T-raww, T-raww
I don’t give a fuck at all
