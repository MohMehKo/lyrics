[Intro: DJ Drama talking]

[Chorus: Tyga]
Ugh tell these bitches I'm the man
Money over bitches nigga that's the plan
Everything I do (well we-we-well done)
Everything I do (well we-we-well done)
Niggas say they're balling they in a stance
If they ain't bout business don't shake my hand
Everything I do (well we-we-well done)
Everything I do (well we-we-well done)

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Hot a motherfucking man
Walk up clear the way it's the ambulance
Firetruck get to the fire in advance
Pop flow I just... (I just show off!)
Pop a motherfucking man
Walk up clear the way it's the ambulance
Firetruck get to the fire in advance
Pop flow I just I just gave the track a tan
Ain't a damn thang we popping champagne
Girls choose saying they rooting for the other team
I put her in a vibe like the magazine
You see it's raining hundreds cash get the cream
The cream the money and money make her scream
Nothing personal it was just a quick fling
But now I'm back to me paper off the shelf bitch
She just wanna get drunk get fucked taste dick
Maybe make a new friend get in the Benz with him
This ain't no simple life you dancing with a star bitch
Yea yea so keep my spotlight bright
Cause I'm a be in the dark night
So go on

[Chorus: Tyga]
Tell these bitches I'm the man
Money over bitches nigga that's the plan
Everything I do (well we-we-well done)
Everything I do (well we-we-well done)
Niggas say they're balling they in a stance
If they ain't bout business don't shake my hand
Everything I do (well we-we-well done)
Everything I do (well we-we-well done)

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Ugh all bout my paper and ain't nothing feeling greater
Come up like elevators now I'm balling like a laker
They like my freestyle but they gonna have to pay me
Candy red marrow tell that bitch it's now or later
Six speed brand new car smell flavoured
Look up in the sky thank god that we major
There's tax to be made world full of danger
So we'll count it under the table to be safer
Ace paid in full all hundreds big jewels
Stones kinda heavy slick Richtor rules
Gaddy gaddy I'm gnarly rawest in the group
See you call out the roof
Sunflying in the coupe

She loves it cause the filling fucking on the million
Fly you in the morning right now we chilling
Stuck in the moment then she back to her life
I'm back to the money cause moneys my life
So go on

[Chorus: Tyga]
Tell these bitches I'm the man
Money over bitches nigga that's the plan
Everything I do (well we-we-well done)
Everything I do (well we-we-well done)
Niggas say they're balling they in a stance
If they ain't bout business don't shake my hand
Everything I do (well we-we-well done)
Everything I do (well we-we-well done)
