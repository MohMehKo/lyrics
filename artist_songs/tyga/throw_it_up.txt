She brought one wild nigga

Could've been a pimp, my fuckin gorilla
Catch a nigga slippin but they don't want a biscuit yea
Man you niggas hate too much

If it is about money I'm a need to loan some
All I have three-some 'til that bitch come get some

[Verse 2:]
I'm with a bad bitch switching lanes
I don't even know her first name, last name
Raised in the era of the dope king
We vibe pump pump, pumpin nigga brakes
And my daddy had a Cadillac
And now his son got a Maybach
When they be screamin' where the ballers at I be like right here
She gon give me head for a LK hat yea
So sick man, I'm fully trippin
I put my dick in a young vixen and dismiss em
A one hitter, a king Griffy, a Scottie Pippen
And pass em off to the next victim
A nigga reptile like rep gank
Believe or not you niggas Ripley
You niggas too J Qwan tipsy
Til that cannon let loose leave you limping motherfucker
