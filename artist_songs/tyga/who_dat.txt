[Intro]

Aghh Getting That Money I've Been Waiting For
Ray Allen Number Nothing Less Then 20K A Show
Used To Wanna Be A BBaller Now I Ball Without A Coach
Her She Ain't Fucking (She Ain't Fucking?)
Aghh Getting That Money I've Been Waiting For
Ray Allen Number Nothing Less Then 20K A Show
Used To Wanna Be A BBaller Now I Ball Without A Coach
Her She ain't Fucking (She Ain't Fucking?)
Then She Gotta Go
I Turn Beast Billy Badass Guerilla Mode
Call Me Young Attack You Just Give Her Minor StrokeS
Patty Cake Dick Her Down The She Row Row Her Boat
Penetrated In Her Throat Now She in A Coma Toast
Been Waiting For Ages My Nigga Kicked In The Fucking Door
Handed Me Some More Bullshit Manifested Evidence
Ever Since Turned Into A Bull Carlos Boozer Shit
Send A Killer A Kill A Stage Or Some Guerilla Shit
Says She Don't Swallow On Her Knees
She Gonna Spit It Out like A Polly Seed
I'm So Nasty Fuck Her In The Backseat
Doggystyle Lassie
Mr Boombastic Shaggy
Motherfuck The Law
I Pac All Ya'll
I Pop Off All Ya'll For My Family My Dawgs
My Mother Bless Her Heart
I Am Her Only Son And Son Ain't Far
Shining I'm A Star Nigga
Luminicent Charm
Just Blew Up But I've Been The Bomb
Boys Tried To Show Up Getting Shitted On
I'm At The Game Courtside With my Tamazon
Carrying Bong Snap Back
Getting Lap Danced While You're Getting Laughed At
I Swear This That Digger Hole Get Your Buried Track
You've Awaken The Dead The Anti Christ Is Back

I Know You Don't Give A Fuck About Me
I Swear I Don't Give A Fuck About You
So I'm a Get This Money Count It All Day
While You Motherfuckers Say Who Dat
