Yeah, yeah,

[Hook: Future & Tyga]
Iâ€™m just now getting to know you
There is a thing I wanna show you
(Show you off, show you off)
There Is a lot I wanna tell you
(No doubt, no doubt)
I'm so scared of failure
There Is a thing I wanna show you
(Show you off, show you off)
There's something I wanna show you
(Show you off, show you off)
There Is a lot I wanna tell you
(No doubt, no doubt)
I'm so scared of failure
(Don't wanna let it all out, yeah)

[Verse 1: Tyga]
That pussy mine, that's anytime
And I get it when I call
She said, couldn't pick a better time
I know it's early, just got back in town
I'mma be there in a minute, drop that towel and it's going down
Pull up on your block, all the neighbours watch
Little things, tell you you're pretty, know you get that a lot
Eyes from a distance, his and hers, gold watch
Everybody seen you with them now them heels, sold out
I invest that time, I respect your grind
Don't keep each other in the dark,cause the sun won't shine
Don't wanna rush it right, but that ass fine
But for now let's just vibe, cause

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I see you working on your body, getting ready for summer
I just got a new phone, and I lost your number
But I'mma get it, cause it's that important
Had to hit up your so called 'friends', man, them bitches annoying
I'm on the road, tell me what you're doing
I got that dough love for you, don't let it ruin
How about you come see LA like a Bruin
Focus on on what we got going, not what everybody else doing
Friday, Friday, party like it's your birthday
They on the same thing and we changed up, they thirsty
Drop the top, California never rains
I feel your love and pain, it's crazy babe, 'cause

[Hook]

[Bridge: Future]
It's like you up and walked in my life out of nowhere
(Where you come from?)
And if I lie to you today girl, that wouldn't be fair (I see)
I wanna take you around the globe
Let me show you off everywhere
(Freebandz)
And eventually I want us to take you there
Oh, yeah
