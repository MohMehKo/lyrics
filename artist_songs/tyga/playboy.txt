[Tyga:]
I got a pornstar tenacity
Fuck her like it's ten of me, I've been a nasty nigga (nigga)
I got a dope boy's tenacity, cocky like I got ten ki's and they harassing me
Super freak in my passenger, she a superstar and got a bat for me
If I hang up she call right back to me, you cut her legs off she crawl right back to me (Uh)

Addicted like crack to my tenacity
I made a path for all my savages, I'm business savy, see
It must be March 'cause y'all mad at me
It's March Madness and I ball like Kansas City
You against me and the city
You know how many pretty bitches drove me to liquor stores
For condoms and sour liquor straws
I get 'em hot Cheetos just to see her lick her fingers
Your boy

Your boy been had a playboy tenacity
Fuck her like it's ten of me, I've been a nasty nigga (nigga)
I got a dope boy's tenacity, cocky like I got ten ki's and they harassing me
Super freak in my passenger, she a superstar and got a bat for me
If I hang up she call right back to me, you cut her legs off she crawl right back to me

Actually she really crawl, lift my balls
And lick the whole sack for me
Playboy tenacity, umbrellas in my jackery
If I ain't poppin' then why the paprazzi flashin' me
Can you answer me?
I call it playboy tenacity
Yeah, that's what it is, that's what it has to be
Yeah, look how I live, this how it had to be (Ahh)
I want it now more than ever
More money, more problems but the money make it better
I ain't tryna fuck and I just fucked her head up
I'm sick with the diagnosis, and that's why I wrote this shit
No bitch
I got a playboy tenacity
Fuck her like it's ten of me, I've been a nasty nigga (nigga)
I got a dope boy's tenacity, cocky like I got ten ki's and they harassing me

[Vince Staples:]
Racing' wing on the GT4
I'm finna drive this motherfucker to the ocean floor
Cold world, long nights with my old girl
If I put a baby in a hoe, she don't abort
I'm found altantis in Atlanta in a strip club
Her body was the baddest, maybe it was [?]
Excuse me, if I scared it
But switching all these [?]
But really mind going, if you don't mind me asking
Can you out your hands on your hips, baby dip dip, dip
Put your shoes on the bed, she move whip, I'ma trip
Windows got tint so you can wear whatever you like
Unless it's more [?]
The funny thing about life is that the clock keep tickin'
So let's have a good time and time is of the essence
And you should gettin' dressed, that's fine
And do whatever you be thinkin', it takes the stress of your mind
And if you need it, we believe it, you could do it all night, alright
