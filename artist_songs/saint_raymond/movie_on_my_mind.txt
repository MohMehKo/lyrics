Tell me that you want me back, I tell you I do
Show me where your heart is at, 'cause I never knew
and I've been looking for the worst in us, 
if you and I, you and I we self destruct
I told you that I want you back, just tell me you do

Burning bridges one by one, 
can we even right our wrongs
feeling numb where we belong, 
afraid to see what we've become

You're the words on my tongue to my favourite song, 
you're the first and the last oh when all's said and done
You're the movie in my mind to which I know every line
In all these things I do, all I see is you

I'm hoping that our hearts don't change, I really do
Keep hoping that it feels the same, when I'm holding you
and I've been tearing down the walls we built of you and I, you and I time stood still
I'm hoping that our hearts don't change, I really do

Burning bridges one by one, 
can we even right our wrongs
feeling numb where we belong, 
afraid to see what we've become

You're the words on my tongue to my favourite song, 
you're the first and the last oh when all's said and done
You're the movie in my mind to which I know every line
in all these things I do, all I see is you

Hold me tightly, break my bones, this page of us we've left untold
Hold me tightly, break my bones, this page of us we've left untold

You're the words on my tongue to my favourite song, 
you're the first and the last oh when all's said and done
You're the movie on my mind to which I know every line
in all these things I do, all I see

You're the words on my tongue to my favourite song, 
you're the first and the last oh when all's said and done
You're the movie in my mind to which I know every line
in all these things I do, in all these things I do, 
in all these things I do, all I see is you.
