Say you wanna run away
Say you won't be there
Say you wanna run away
Say you won't be there
Say you wanna run away
Say you won't be there
Say you wanna run away, run away, run away

Lights in the morning, fades by the evening
If I was to tell you, you wouldn't believe me
Slip a bit further, everytime you're not here
Trying to show you, but still you won't see it

If you say you're gonna leave for brighter days
If you say you think that things'll never change
I won't have to keep on pushing you away
If you escape, then I won't have to

Say you wanna run away
Say you won't be there
Say you wanna run away, run away, run away

Hidin' 'round corners, still you're chasin' my shadow
If I was to see you, we'd be back to the old flow
So I keep myself hidden, and you're not even thinkin'
I can't seem to tell you, that we're slowly sinking

If you say you're gonna leave for brighter days
If you say you think that things'll never change
I won't have to keep on pushing you away
If you escape, then I won't have to

Maybe I won't feel the same, no
Maybe I won't feel the same, no
Maybe when you find enough, I'll regret the final push
Maybe we don't need to change
Maybe we don't need to change

If you say you're gonna leave for brighter days
If you say you think that things'll never change
I won't have to keep on pushing you away
If you escape, then I won't have to

If you say you're gonna leave for brighter days
If you say you think that things'll never change
I won't have to keep on pushing you away
If you escape, then I won't have to

Say you wanna run away
Say you won't be there
Say you wanna run away, run away, run away
