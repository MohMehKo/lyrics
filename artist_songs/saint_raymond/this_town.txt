So head back to this street where, I see your name
And oh you're settled now, I know by this thing called fame
So we counted with letters and spelt with numbers too
Oh are town lives on

So head back to the street where, I see your face
I can honestly say I've never introduced the disgrace
And your character like clay, so easily breaks
Oh are town lives on

You steal our pride and you take our hearts
You kick us down, yeah you tare me apart
You will never know what it feels like
To be alive
To be alive

So head back to the street where, this all began
You try to escape, so you ran and you ran
And a thousand times, you have seen this all before
Oh are town lives on

You steal our pride and you take our hearts
You kick us down, yeah you tare me apart
You will never know what it feels like
You steal our pride and you take our hearts
You kick us down, yeah you tare me apart
You will never know what it feels like
To be alive
