Freeing up time just to waste it
Breaking the tides and I'm aching
Open the skies as I wake up
Saying goodbye as I wake up
Surfing the wave with my eyes closed

You're hoping I'll be the saviour
Carry me home when I need ya
Don't be afraid of the water
Just think of it all that I've taught ya

Why why are you waiting?
Its fate that we're tempting
Don't look back

Throw me down to the river
Hold my heart now I need ya
Where we know we can't be found
Throw me down to the river
Hold my heart and I will lead ya
To a land which where they aren't
In which they aren't [x9]

Hold my heart now I need ya
Where we know we can't be found
Throw me down to the river
Hold my heart and I will lead ya
To a land which where they aren't
Where which they...
