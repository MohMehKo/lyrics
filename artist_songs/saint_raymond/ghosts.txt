I wish I was ghost now, 
Living in a ghost town
Surrounded by the dark
I've been talking to outlines
Telling me about my life
I watched it from the start

And it goes on and on and on and on
Looking at me but the lights aren't on
And I can see the flicker now
Won't you come and bring me down

I'll be right round darling won't keep me
I'll be right round
I'll be right round darling won't keep me warm
Darling won't you keep me warm
Darling won't you keep me warm

I wish there was a nice way 
You know I'd never dare say
Stop before you start
I just want to drown it out
Playback no sound
But two voices in the dark

And it goes on and on and on and on
Looking at me but the lights aren't on
And I can see the flicker now
Won't you come and bring me down

I'll be right round darling won't keep me
I'll be right round
I'll be right round darling won't keep me warm
Darling won't you keep me warm
Darling won't you keep me warm

Won't you tell me that I'm wrong
I need it
Won't you tell me that I'm wrong

Won't you tell me that I'm wrong
I need it
Won't you tell me that I'm wrong
Tell me that I'm wrong

I'll be right round darling won't keep me
I'll be right round
I'll be right round darling won't keep me warm
Darling won't you keep me warm
Darling won't you keep me warm
