We've all been waiting for this,
But it always comes too quick.
Spend our days in the playground,
Pretending not to be kids.

The girls are in the corner,
Already had too much to drink.
Boys hide behind their laughter,
Like they don't care what girls think.

We will never be as young as we are now,
The faces in the crowd are thinning out.
And I'm not saying stick around,
But stick around.
Oh, we may never have another like today,
Tomorrow is brand new start away.
And we'll never be as young as are now,
As we are now

We'll all been getting tired,
Of the streets that we've outgrown.
We sit indoors for hours,
Now King George has lost his throne.
But something out there's calling,
A whisper we call home.
The nights that I stayed with you,
Cos' you didn't want to be alone.

We will never be as young as we now,
The faces in the crowd are thinning out.
And I'm not saying stick around,
But stick around.
Oh, we may never have another like today,
Tomorrow is brand new start away.
And we'll never be as young as we are now,
As we are now
