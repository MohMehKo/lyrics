The city screams and my echoes dream
I long for hope; it's all I see
She's fallen over, so I carry her home
She's fallen over, so I carry her home

The morning brings such a longed for dawn
We wait through all this but what for
She's climbing out now so I hold it still
She's climbing out now so I hold it still

Now she rests her head
Time is just her bed
Just a child in your very own eyes
Crying out for an element of surprise
She's feeling old now so I bring her back
She's feeling old now so I bring her back
Now she rests her head

All that we see's not a fairy tale, a fairy tale
Now it's my time to carry you, I'll carry you
And all this could be
A miracle for us
A miracle for us
A miracle for us

In a flash of panic
We all forget
The real reasons we felt so blessed
We hold a smile in a memory
We hold a smile in a memory

All that we see's not a fairy tale, a fairy tale
Now it's my time to carry you, I'll carry you
And all this could be
A miracle for us
All that we see's not a fairy tale, a fairy tale
Now it's my time to carry you, I'll carry you
And all this could be
A miracle for us
A miracle for us
A miracle for us

The city screams and my echoes dream
She's fallen over, so I carry her home
She's fallen over, so I carry her home
