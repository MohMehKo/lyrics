Heart don't fail me now
Don't fail me now

I think it's too much right now, it's gonna slow me down
Waitin' the wrong suit long is gonna wear me out
Give in to wondering eyes, I'll hit the ground
We're all fighting in the battle of the lost and found

It feels like I'm getting closer
Faith is all we need

Heart beatin' in my chest
Don't fail me now, don't fail me now
Feet standing on the edge
Don't fail me now, don't fail me now
Will I find the courage to do this alone?
And face the darkness, jump into the unknown
Heart beatin' in my chest
Don't fail me now, don't fail me now

Fighting with the voices in my head
Telling me that I should take a break
But I know if I slow then I won't get up again
So, I'll keep rising up from hidden days

It feels like I'm getting closer

Heart beatin' in my chest
Don't fail me now, don't fail me now
Feet standing on the edge
Don't fail me now, don't fail me now
Will I find the courage to do this alone?
Embrace the darkness, jump into the unknown
Heart beatin' in my chest
Don't fail me now, don't fail me now

Heart don't fail me now
Don't fail me now

Heart beatin' in my chest
Don't fail me now, don't fail me now
Feet standing on the edge
Don't fail me now, don't fail me now!
Will I find the courage to do this alone?
Embrace the darkness, jump into the unknown
Heart beatin' in my chest
Don't fail me now, don't fail me now
