Your house burnt down in this bonfire
'Cause a house is not a home when
You're alone

You can laugh and cry now
All you want

We'll see who's standing
In the end

Your cold hand met, my shoulder
'Cause ignorance is not the one when
You're alone

Oh you can laugh and cry now
All you want

We'll see who's standing
In the end

Woa-oh, woa-oh, woa-oh, in the end
Woa-oh, woa-oh, woa-oh, in the end

Your house burnt down in this bonfire
'Cause a house is not a home when
You're alone

You can laugh and cry now
All you want

We'll see who's standing
In the end

Woa-oh, woa-oh, woa-oh, in the end
Woa-oh, woa-oh, woa-oh, in the end

Woa-oh, woa-oh, woa-oh, in the end
Woa-oh, woa-oh, woa-oh

Your house burnt down in this bonfire
'Cause a house is not a home when
You're alone

You can laugh and cry now
All you want

We'll see who's standing
In the end
