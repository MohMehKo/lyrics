I run to the morning
As the nightmares chase to haunt me
Should I make her stand?

I walk in the shadows
Cause I'm scared of what the light shows
Is there power in these hands?

I feel like a wasted soul
A hologram of skin and bones

This is the time
You know that it's right
Cause I'm letting go
In love and in life
There's no turning back
Cause I'm letting go

There's pain in the falling
The landing hits you without warning
At least you're at the start

There's fate in the climbing
Sometimes the voices will be blinding
But they'll never have your heart

So ride the highs and mute the lows
It puts the flesh back to your bones

This is the time
You know that it's right
Cause I'm letting go
In love and in life
There's no turning back
I'm letting go

Before the sun is set
Time to forgive, forget
Whatever happens, happens
But it ain't happened yet
But it ain't happened yet

I'm letting go
In love and in life
There's no turning back
Cause I'm letting go

This is the time
You know that it's right
Cause I'm letting go
In love and in life
There's no turning back
Cause I'm letting go

So give me time to wake up
So give me time to wake up and go
So give me time to wake up
So give me time to wake up and go
