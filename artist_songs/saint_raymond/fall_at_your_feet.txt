Stop stop go,
If I can make can I keep myself whole,
Am I wasting time on my own,
Woah oh oh
On my own

How do I start,
Tripping over my head and my heart,
Don't think I'll be the last,
Woah oh oh
No oh oh,
Why should I care at all

Watch me fall at your feet,
Give it all to make you feel complete,
But who am I trying to be,
Who am I trying to please,

You can have it woah oh oh,
You can have it oh oh oh,
You can have it woah oh oh,
You can have it oh oh oh,

Have I got that much to give,
Maybe I'm losing and trying to resist,
Should I just go with it,
Woah oh oh
Go oh oh
Why should I care at all,

Watch me fall at your feet,
Give it all to make you feel complete,
But who am I trying to be,
Who am I trying to please,

You can have it woah oh oh,
You can have it oh oh oh,
You can have it woah oh oh,
You can have it oh oh oh,

Have it oh,

Round and round we just keep going
Back and forth this tide keeps flowing,
Round and round we just keep going
Back and forth this tide keeps flowing

You can have it woah oh oh,
You can have it oh oh oh,
You can have it woah oh oh,
You can have it oh oh oh,

Watch me fall at your feet,
You can have it woah oh oh,
But who am I trying to be,
You can have it oh oh oh,
Watch me fall at your feet,
You can have it woah oh oh,
But who am I trying to be,
You can have it oh oh oh,

Round and round we just keep going
Back and forth this tide keeps flowing,
Round and round we just keep going
Back and forth this tide keeps flowing
