Throw me a lifeline, not for the first time,
I'm on a sinking ship going down with it
I don't know why, but I'm in need of it tonight
But I can't get back off this beating track

Every time I'm far away from you, far away from you
I forget just how it is with you, how it is
I don't want to take you home to bed
Every time you call

I wanna be there, I wanna be there
I wanna be there, I wanna be there

So he told me, told me I'd see
Nothing's gunna change we'll stay the same 
You can find me, you know where I am gunna be
Dreaming home sweet home chasing your shadow

Every time I'm far away from you, far away from you
I forget just how it is with you, how it is
I don't want to take you home to bed
Every time you call

I wanna be there, I wanna be there
I wanna be there, I wanna be there

I wanna be loved, gotta be brave 
Nothing left to say
I wanna be loved, gotta be brave

I wanna be there, I wanna be there
I wanna be there, I wanna be there

I wanna be loved, gotta be brave
Wish that I could make a change

I wanna be loved, gotta be brave
Guess I'll have to find a way

I wanna be loved, gotta be brave
There's nothing else to say, I wanna be loved

I wanna be there, I wanna be there
I wanna be there, I wanna be there

I wanna be loved, gotta be brave
Nothing else to say

I wanna be loved, gotta be brave

I wanna be there, I wanna be there
