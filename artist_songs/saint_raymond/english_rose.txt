No matter where I roam
I will return to my english rose
For no bonds
Can ever tempt me from she
I've sailed the seven seas
Flown the whole blue sky
But I return with haste
To where my love does lie
No matter where I go
I will come back to my english rose
For nothing
Can ever keep me from she
I've searched the secret mists
I've climbed the highest peaks
Caught the first train home
To be at her side
No matter where I roam
I will return to my english rose
For no bonds
Can ever keep me from she
I've been to ancient worlds
Scourd the whole universe
Caught the first train home
To be at her side
No matter where I go
I will come back to my english rose
For no bonds could ever keep me from she
No matter where I roam
I will return my to english rose
For no bonds could ever tempt me from she
