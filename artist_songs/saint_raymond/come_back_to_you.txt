Pull me in once again now
You've always got a hole on me
Take me in just to throw me out
You know it's only you I see ...

Cause even with the lights down
I saw you running
With the lights out I saw it coming
I don't know why
Forgive me now
I don't know what you want from me

Cause my heart still dreams of you
Is there something I can do?
From the start I always knew
I'll come back, come back, come back, come back
to you...
Ohh oh oh
I'll come back, come back to you
Ohh oh oh
I'll come back come back to you

I don't know why I'm here again
Feel your body next to mine
Sink back into our old ways
Pretending everything's alright

But I know with the lights down
I'll be running
With the lights out
I know what's coming
I don't know why, forgive me know
I don't know what you want from me

Cause my heart still dreams of you
Is there something I can do?
From the start I always knew
I'll come back, come back, come back, come back to you...
Ohh oh oh oh oh
I'll come back, come back to you
Ohh oh oh oh oh
I'll come back, come back

Hold on
I'll be by your side throw me a lifeline
If I'm wrong
I'll put my hands up
All we can do is try...

My heart still dreams of you
Is there something I can do?
From the start I always knew
I'll come back, come back, come back to you
Ohh oh oh
I'll come back, come back to you
Oh oh oh
I'll come back, come back to you

My heart still dreams of you
Is there something I can do?
From the start I always knew
I'll come back, come back to you

My heart still dreams of you
Is there something I can do?
From the start I always knew
I'll come back, come back to you
