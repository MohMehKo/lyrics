If it was mine to give
D'you think I'd give it up?
You call it what you want,
I know it's not enough.

It's just the fool I am to look the other way,
It seems I'm lost again,
It seems I've lost my way.

Because I'm searching for something I hope in my heart I will find,
And though it's testing my patience away I'll be biding my time.

You know it's fine I've got all day,
Maybe there isn't a right way,
Gotta believe that I won't stray,
I don't wanna play these games,
All I know is I don't ever want to tame this wild heart
From beating for another.

It could be mine to keep,
It's only out of sight,
You call it what you want
I know that it's high time
To walk the open road
Under a dark grey sky.
With total fate
In what I'll find.

Because I'm searching for something I hope in my heart I will find,
And though it's testing my patience away I'll be biding my time.

You know it's fine I've got all day,
Maybe there isn't a right way,
Gotta believe that I won't stray,
I don't wanna play these games,
All I know is I don't ever want to tame this wild heart
From beating for another.

I won't turn off the light,
And I won't put out the fire

You know it's fine I've got all day,
Maybe there isn't a right way,
Gotta believe that I won't stray,
I don't wanna play these games,
All I know is I don't ever want to tame this wild heart
From beating for another.ï»¿
