In the past, I've been a fool
It's a truth I've lived through
All I know is I must
Keep you by my side 
Keep you by my side 

If it rains, then let it rain
If it hurts, I'll share the pain
All I know is I must
Keep you by my side
Keep you by my side 

And oh, I always wanted to belong 
I always wanted to belong 
Will you stay with me tonight
'Cause I'm tired of saying goodbye,
You're the truth I can't deny
And I'll never let you go 
And I'll never let you go 
And I'll never let you go 
And I'll never let you go 

In the past, I've been a wreck
Wasted time I still regret
If we forgive and forget
I'll hold you in my arms 
Hold you in my arms 

If the tides change, let them change
If it hurts, I'll share the pain
When the clouds break,
I will hold you in my arms 
Hold you in my arms 

And oh, I always wanted to belong 
I always wanted to belong 
Will you stay with me tonight
'Cause I'm tired of saying goodbye,
You're the truth I can't deny
And I'll never let you go 
And I'll never let you go 
And I'll never let you go 
And I'll never let you go 

I'm holding out for,
Holding out for,
Holding out for you
I'm holding out for,
Holding out for,
I'm holding out for,

Will you stay with me tonight
'Cause I'm tired of saying goodbye,
You're the truth I can't deny
And I'll never let you go 
And I'll never let you go 
And I'll never let you go 
And I'll never let you go 

Will you stay with me tonight (And I'll never let you go)
'Cause I'm tired of saying goodbye (I'll never let you go),
You're the truth I can't deny (I'll never let you go)
And I'll never let you go.
