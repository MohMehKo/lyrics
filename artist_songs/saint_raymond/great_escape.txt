Oh my brother now
Keep me in safe hands
I know you'll understand

Cause I've found a lover now
Shes more hurt than it's worth 
And I don't know which is worse

That I still want it
But I don't need it 
I keep on leaving
But I'll always return 

Brother I'll show ya
The storms going to pass us forever 
Just hold on we'll make it through
I know things are changing 
Come with me we'll brace it together
You know that you want to

Could this be our great escape 
Our great escape 
Our great escape 
Could this be our great escape 
Our great escape 
Our great escape 

Oh my brother now
The city lights they shine
I'm scared of what I'll find 

The waves come crashing down 
Will I get back out
It leaves me in doubt 

You say I want it
But I don't need it 
I keep on leaving
Then turn back around

Brother I'll show ya
The storms going to pass us forever 
Just hold on we'll make it through
I know things are changing 
Come with me we'll brace it together
You know that you want to

Could this be our great escape 
Our great escape 
Our great escape 
Could this be our great escape 
Our great escape 
Our great escape 

I see a light to guide us through the dark 
This is our great escape
Our great escape
Our great escape

Where do we go to find all the answers?
Where do we go to take second chances?
Tell me I'm wrong 
We just tried to hide it 
Where will we go?
Where will we go?

Could this be our great escape 
Our great escape 
Our great escape 
Could this be our great escape 
Our great escape 
Our great escape 

I see a light to guide us through the dark 
This is our great escape
Our great escape
Our great escape
