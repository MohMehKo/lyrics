Sunrise, heart falls
Soft eyes, lost cause
Watching all we had slip through our hands

Loose ends, tongue tied
Time has run dry
Some things in life we just don't understand

You walk away
Come back a friend, holding the flame
Pick up again like we always do

We carry on holding the thread, holding our breath
You say your (seen) so I believe it's true

She will always be the one with all the answers
She will always be the queen of second chances
Running through my head just like she planned it
I can't let go

In the half light, I feel the flicker of a feeling so right
But did we have the time to get it wrong?

You walk away
Come back a friend holding the flame
Pick up again like we always do
We carry on holding the thread, holding our breath
You say your *seen* so I believe it's true

She will always be the one with all the answers
She will always be the queen of second chances
Running through my head just like she planned it
I can't let go

She don't know
She don't know
She don't know
She don't know
She don't know
She don't know
She don't know
She don't know

She will always be the one with all the answers
She will always be the queen of second chances
Running through my head just like she planned it
I can't let go
