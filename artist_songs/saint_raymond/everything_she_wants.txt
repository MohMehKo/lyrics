Take back what we know is a hurricane,
moves faster than anything we try to feign,
sleep tight this storm is a lullaby,
in time it'll pass us by...
It comes back to haunt us again and again,
it's a white noise, it's a white noise,
the heartache,
the thunder,
the dust rising high,
it's a white noise, it's a white noise...
But in this life,
we can see everything,
in this life...
If I could give her, give her, give her,
everything she wants,
If I could show her, show her, show her,
everything she needs,
If I could give her, give her, give,
everything she wants,
If I could show her, show her, show her,
everything she needs...
Take back what we know is a hurricane,
goes out everytime you get your own way,
sleep tight this storm is a dark sky,
wake up and it's passed us by...
It comes back to haunt us again and again,
it's a white noise, it's a white noise,
the heartache,
the thunder,
the dust rising high,
it's a white noise, it's a white noise...
But in this life,
we can see everything,
in this life,
If I could give her, give her, give,
everything she wants,
If I could show her, show her, show her,
everything she needs...
If I could give her, give her, give,
everything she wants,
If I could show her, show her, show her,
everything she needs...
If you're the girl who rules my heart,
I'm still the boy to tear it all apart,
you're still the girl who rules my heart,
I'm still the boy to tear it all apart,
you're still the girl who rules my heart,
I'm still the boy to tear it all apart,
you're still the girl who rules my heart,
it's all for us,
it's all for us...
If I could give her, give her, give,
everything she wants,
If I could show her, show her, show her,
everything she needs...
If I could give her, give her, give,
everything she wants,
If I could show her, show her, show her,
everything she needs...
