We are the night
We are the yellow moon in the sky
We are the ambler glow
Of a firelight
In a lover's eyes

We are the dark
We are a hundred billion stars
We are the heavy hearts on the subway cars
We are the night

We are the night
They're gonna say we just ain't right
But we are the night
We are the night

And we just wanna be free
Is there anything more lovely?
We got our whole lives to love
And tonight we're as young as we'll ever be
So don't you never look back
Today could be our last
And we'll just live as we are
Unmoved by the darkness we face
Cause we are the night
They're gonna say we just ain't right
But we are the night
We are the night

We are the brave
We are the ones they couldn't shake
Ain't part of that machine
So unshamefully, we ignite

We are the light
And we're just tryin' to get it right
We won't stop pressin' on
Through the firestorms
We will rise

We are the night
They're gonna say we just ain't right
But we are the night
We are the night

And we just wanna be free
Is there anything more lovely?
We got our whole lives to love
And tonight we're as young as we'll ever be
So don't you never look back
Today could be our last
And we'll just live as we are
Unmoved by the darkness we face
Cause we are the night
They're gonna say we just ain't right
But we are the night
We are the night

[Spoken:]
So for every boy and every girl
No matter who you love
And for all my trans brothers and sisters
Of every race, in every place around this globe
It's our time
We will rise

And we just wanna be free
Is there anything more lovely?
We got our whole lives to love
And tonight we're as young as we'll ever be
So don't you never look back
Today could be our last
And we'll just live as we are
Unmoved by the darkness we face
Cause we are the night
They're gonna say we just ain't right
But we are the night
We are the night
