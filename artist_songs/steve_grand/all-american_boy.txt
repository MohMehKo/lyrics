Ripped jeans, only drinks whiskey
Found him by the fire while his girl was gettin' frisky, oh
I say we go this road tonight

And he smiles, his arms around her
But his eyes are holdin' me, just a captive to his wonder, oh
I say we go this road tonight

And now I know that that's your girl, I mean no disrespect
The way that shirt hugs you chest, boy, I just won't forget
I'll be sittin' here, drinking my whiskey
I won't say good night unless I think ya might miss me, oh

Be my All-American boy tonight
Where everyday's the 4th of July
It's alright, alright
And we can keep this up till the morning light
And you can hold me deep in your eyes
It's alright, alright
So be my, be my
My All-American boy

Ripped jeans, a tight shirt
He lights a cigarette, you know I'm glad that she can't stand it, oh
I drink the moonlight from his eyes

Now hold there, just a moment
I wanna take this in now we don't need no photo of it, no
We should go this road tonight

Now I know that that's your girl and I don't give a damn
She's been cussin' and cryin', she don't know what she has
I'll be sittin' here, tryin' to hold down my whiskey
You tell your girl good night 'cause somebody'd like to kiss me, oh

Be my All-American boy tonight
Where everyday's the 4th of July
It's alright, alright
And we can keep this up till the morning light
And you can hold me deep in your eyes
It's alright, alright
So be my, be my
My All-American boy

Of all the girls and boys who look my way
Ain't nobody ever hit me this way
So won't you come back with me
And lay with me a while

I'm gonna wrestle you out of them clothes,
And leave the beautiful body exposed,
And you can have my heart and my soul and my body
Oh, be mine

Be my All-American boy tonight
Baby, you'll light my fire
I'll make you feel alright, alright
And we can keep this up till the morning light
And you can hold me deep in your eyes
It's alright, alright
So be my, be my
Just be my, be my
My All-American boy
