Oh oh oh, oh oh oh... oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Carve you out a hollow bed of quiet
Let me knead your heart back to healthy blindness
Where it used to be
Baby, it was you and me

Be my shield, I will be your soldier
Waging war for love
It's an art just staying sober
While piece by piece
This swollen heart just swallows me

Maybe we just give it some time?
Oh, oh you gotta let me give it a try
And now my friends keep telling me to get help
I hardly recognize myself

I'm all red, white and blue
My heart's a mess, I'm busted up for you
You twist the knife so deep
The pleasure and the pain cuts me 'til I bleed

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh... oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

And have no doubt, I never meant to hurt you
Babe, it's over now
You know I didn't mean to undermine our trust
Leave us in a cloud of dust

Maybe we just give it some time?
Oh, oh you gotta let me give it a try
And, yeah, I know I really need to get help
Cause, babe, I can't control myself

I'm all red, white and blue
My heart's a mess, I'm busted up for you
You twist the knife so deep
The pleasure and the pain cuts me 'til I bleed

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh... oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Tell me that you want it
I already got it
Tell me that you want it
Mmm mmm mmm

Tell me that you want it
I already got it
Tell me that you, that you, that you

I'm all red, white and blue
My heart's a mess, I'm busted up for you
You twist the knife so deep
The pleasure and the pain cuts me 'til I bleed

I said red, white and blue
My heart's a mess, I'm busted up for you
You twist the knife so deep
The pleasure and the pain cuts me 'til I bleed

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh... oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh [x4]
