W-w-w-w-whiskey crime!

Whiskey, whiskey make things right
Imma feeling kinda low tonight
Together we can take this guy
Don't matter that he's twice our size

Whiskey, whiskey make me brave
Oh the things that you get me to say
They tell me I'm just not okay
But we're just having fun
The way you keep me coming undone

I don't want beer, I won't drink wine
That fruity Appletini, that's a whiskey crime
Liquor that's clear? Not over here!
That sour gin and tonic only makes you cry
Vodka or tequila? N-not for me'ah!
Now you know what I want, so you know what I need-ah
Gi-give me that feeling, gi-give me that feeling, ohhhhhh...

W-w-w-w-whiskey crime!

Whiskey, whiskey out so late
Imma, feeling like I shouldn't stay
People they just love to hate
And we're just having fun!

Whiskey, whiskey make me strong
Yeah! Keep me going all night long
Help me sing this Springsteen song
Even when we're outta key, it's perfect harmony

I don't want beer, I won't drink wine
That fruity Appletini, that's a whiskey crime
Liquor that's clear? Not over here!
That sour gin and tonic only makes you cry
Vodka or tequila? N-not for me'ah!
Now you know what I want, so you know what I need-ah
Gi-give me that feeling, gi-give me that feeling, ohhhhhh...

W-w-w-w-whiskey crime!

Whiskey, whiskey I know I'm young
But I'm really thinking you're the one
Always ready to give me some of that
Dark rich love, yeah, I'm thinking you're the one

I don't want beer, I won't drink wine
That fruity Appletini, that's a whiskey crime
Liquor that's clear? Not over here!
That sour gin and tonic only makes you cry
Vodka or tequila? N-not for me'ah!
Now you know what I want, so you know what I need-ah
Gi-give me that feeling, gi-give me that feeling, ohhhhhh...
