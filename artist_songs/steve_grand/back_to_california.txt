Do you remember California? 20-oh-6? 
You told me we could change this world 
I had no doubt about it 
I was always kind of awkward 
You never seemed to mind 
Just two kids in high school 
What could we know about life? 

You were my tiny dancer 
Golden hair and yellow eyes 
I was your disaster 
Always brushing you aside, I didn't see it right then 
But in the years that have gone by 
I found I'll never know a better friend 
Than this one I left behind...ohhhh 

So you're getting married 
I hope he’s nothing like our daddies 
When we were young 
And love was something so fucked-up 
It’s sure had its toll on me 

So it’s back to California in my mind 
Petty arguments on bus rides in muted sunlight 
We belong to California, young and free and wild 
Where our dreams grew big as your yellow eyes 
As they looked into mine... 

Do you remember summer nights? Out in the parking lot? 
Checkin out those seniors? Man those drum-line boys were hot 
And we danced under the street lamps, high off that summer heat 
“Just two more years! Just two more years!” and we'd be outta here...ohh 

Now we're getting older 
The world's grown dark and colder 
You're in law school. 
I'm a bar back in the neighborhood. 

So it’s back to California in my mind 
Petty arguments on bus rides in muted sunlight 
We belong to California, young and free and wild 
Where our dreams grew big as your yellow eyes 
As they looked into mine... 
As they looked into mine... 

Ooooohhh oooh ohhh 
Ooooohhh oooh ohhh
