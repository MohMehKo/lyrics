So you got your big job
And moved out to the city
Always said you wanted out of here
But now you're back here at my door
With your eyes fixed on the floor
I think somebody could use a beer
Here at the lake where this all began
And like it or not, you're going in

I got you out on the water, soaking wet
Got that white t-shirt clinging to your chest
Yeah, the sun's going down, but it ain't gone yet
We can dry off a little later on
'Cus we're having a little too much fun
Being soaking wet, eh, eh
Being soaking wet, eh, oh

Remember that time we stole your sister's bike
And you rode it off the edge of the pier?
Yeah, those were the days
Before you went away
But I'm glad you found your way back here
To this lake where it all began
So like it or not we're going in!

I got you out on the water, soaking wet
Got that white t-shirt clinging to your chest
Yeah, the sun's going down, but it ain't gone yet
We can dry off a little later on
Yeah, I got you out on the water, soaking wet
You had to know when I told you to hold your breath
Acting all mad, I know you better than that
We can dry off a little later on
'Cus we're having a little too much fun
Being soaking wet, eh, eh
Got you soaking wet, eh, oh
You're soaking wet, eh, eh
Got you soaking wet, eh, oh

I hope you're happy
Honestly, I do
But I'd be lying if I said
"I don't miss you"

I got you out on the water
Got that white t-shirt
Yeah, the sun's going down
But it ain't gone yet
We can dry off a little later on
Yeah, I got you out on the water, soaking wet
You had to know when I told you to hold your breath
Acting all mad, I know you better than that
We can dry off a little later on
'Cus we're having a little too much fun
Being soaking wet, eh, eh
Got you soaking wet, eh, oh
Got you soaking wet, eh, eh
I got you soaking wet, eh, oh
