"Close the door," he says
"This'll only be a minute"
But sometimes minutes can get
Caught in suspension
"I finally figured it out
And you're that someone
Who knows a little more
Than something about me."
He says, "I met this girl out in Palm Springs
Man, she's the best! You'd be so happy for me!"
And it hits me hard
Seeing this blue-eyed dream sprouting wings
And flying away from me
Flying away from me, yeah

[Chorus:]
What if I say you love me?
Could I make it true?
We could build us something
That would mean something to you
Cause when I close my eyes
I'm in this world where you don't have a girl
And I'm right by your side
Say you love me
It don't mean that I'll ever have you
Oh, no

So we're driving home
I look out at the rain on the roads out my
Passenger window
It's been one of those nights
It all feels so alive
Man, you bet, I'm going to hate saying goodbye
He pulls up on my driveway
Says, "See you on Friday"
If he only knew what I'd do to be
The rain on his coat
Those keys that he holds
Or the one he has waiting back home

[Chorus]

I'm not going to lie
A stubborn part of me keeps the hope alive
That someday I'll be yours and you'll be mine
And I know you'll never understand
So to keep from losing my best friend
I hold it all inside

Say you love me
We could build us something

[Chorus]
