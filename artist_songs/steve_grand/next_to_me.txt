I've been known to break a few hearts
And ain't that the truth
Wild hearts growing restless
Wild heart's on the loose

I ain't drunk, you're just uptight
I ain't dumb, I'm just your fool
I ain't well, but it’s alright
I hope you want me to
Move on in closer to you you you

Oooh oh oo-ooh
You're dancin next to me
Oooh oh oo-ooh
You move that body like
Oooh oh oo-ooh
It’s takin over me now
Keep dancing (ahhhh)
Keep dancin next to me

We get up to your apartment
Keep the lights down low
Your skin in that dim light
The way your body glows

I ain't drunk, you're just uptight
I ain't dumb, I'm just your fool
I ain't well, but it’s alright
I hope you want me to
Move on in closer to you you you

Oooh oh oo-ooh
You're dancin next to me
Oooh oh oo-ooh
You move that body like
Oooh oh oo-ooh
It’s takin over me now
Keep dancing (ahhhh)
Keep dancin next to me

Now baby don't be scared
I want to take you... take you... there
I will take you there
(ohhhh ohhhh ohhh)
I will take you there, I will take you there
Darlin don't be scared, I will take you there
I will take you there, darlin don't be scared
I will take you, take you, take you, take you there

Oh Baby, come in close
I want you out of those clothes
And down on your knees like you're dyin to praise the good Lord for makin' you so damn beautiful

Oooh oh oo-ooh
You're dancin next to me
Oooh oh oo-ooh
You move that body like
Oooh oh oo-ooh
It’s takin over me now
Keep dancing (ahhhh)
Keep dancin next to me
