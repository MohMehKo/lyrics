I know I probably shouldn’t say this out loud
But I miss you
Two weeks apart left me out in the dark
But I miss you too
So I against my better judgement
I followed him up those stairs to his third floor apartment

Drunk eyes make me think of the first time they looked at me that way
Then he says this doesn’t change a thing
Now he’s holding me like it’s the end
It makes me wonder was this all pretend
This might keep me, this just might keep me from loving again, no

I gotta pick myself up off the floor
And no I won’t be coming back for more
You won’t keep me, you won’t keep me
From loving, loving again
Oh-woah oh, oh, oh, oh

I’m too drunk to sleep feeling tired, and weak and unfocused, oh
I want him out of my mind he stole enough of my time
Left me feel broken, oh

So against my better judgement
I found a photo of us with us in the sun
With your big arms around me holding me tightly
But now you say I don’t love you that way

And now he’s holding me like it’s the end
It makes me wonder was this all pretend
This might keep me, this just might keep me from loving again, no

I gotta pick myself up off the floor
And no I won’t be coming back for more
You won’t keep me, you won’t keep me
From loving, loving again
Oh-woah oh, oh, oh, oh

And just so you know
That when I go, there ain’t no turning back, no-oh
I kinda hope this is stings a little
you burned me once, alright
But burned me twice and boy you better watch your behind
Cause this is gonna sting a little
This is gonna sting a little-oh

Now he’s holding me like the end
Makes me wonder was this all pretend
This just me keep me, just might keep me from loving again, no

I gotta pick myself up off the floor
And no I won’t be coming back for more
You won’t keep me, you won’t keep me
From loving, oh, from loving, loving again
Oh-woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
