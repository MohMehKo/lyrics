I said Baby
You can't save me
I won't change
I guess we're better off this way
I guess we're better off
Better off this way...yeah

Softly, as evening falls into the stars
I reach your hand before the Earth goes dark
If we had everything under this twilight
I swear we'd make it to Mars
But you left no refuge here now for the dark nights
And the miles and miles of bars
Don't blame yourself
You didn't kill this thing alone

I said Baby
You can't save me
I won't change
You know we're better off this way
I said Baby
You can't save me, no
I won't change
I guess we're better off this way
I guess we're better off
Better off, better off...better this way

Show me, that side of me I'm scared to know
I need your truths before I let you go
Now that look in your eyes still leaves me blinded
Is this the death of my youth?
We're always searching for, hoping, and dying for
But do we really want the truth?
Do you see that side of me I used to?

I said Baby
You can't save me
I won't change
You know we're better off this way
I said Baby
You can't save me, no
I won't change
I guess we're better off this way
I guess we're better off
Better off, better off...better this way

Under a shooting star, I wish away my heart
May you live outside the shadow of this day
Cause baby the love we shared
Itâ€™s outta this stratosphere
And I hope you come to know the same
Better off, better off...better this way

I said Baby
You can't save me
I won't change
You know we're better off this way
I said Baby
You can't save me, no
I won't change
I guess we're better off this way
I guess we're better off
Better off, better off...better this way
