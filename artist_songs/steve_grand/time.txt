Twenty-two, I was made for you
Steel eyes and blinders too
We were right on track
To burn out fast
Winter moved along
Sun rays through a morning fog
No space or time
Just you and I
Tangled in sheets, while your body heat's
Keepin' me warm

And you were keepin' me warm through those nights
Where I left my life to the cold outside
You left your light on
Oh you let me shine on

[Chorus:]
When time was on our side
You and I suspended in that warm streetlight
And if you ever figure out this life
Keep tellin' me those sweet, sweet lies
Cause I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

You had me meet your friends
I never loved you more than when
We watched that game
Back at Andy's place
Pretending to give a damn
About coaches and quarterbacks
With your head in my lap
Now who could blame me for that?
Steel eyes stealin' my heart
Right from the start

And you were keepin' me warm through those nights
Where I left my life to the cold outside
You left your light on
Oh you let me shine on

[Chorus x2]
