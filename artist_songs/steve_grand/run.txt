I’m the 101, I’m 18 from
This brand new man I will become
I am born again, right out this skin
I only live to start again
So I run

24, I’m not so sure
What this life should mean to me anymore
I mean no disrespect, I just don’t give a shit
No one knows the cards a man’s workin with
So I run
I start to run

I start to run, I’m still young
Not looking back from where I come
You get this life, just one time
You do yours and I’ll do mine
So I run
So I run

I’ve loved and lost, I’ve turned and tossed
I’ve shuddered at the pain I’ve caused
I crossed that line, no good at lies
I looked the devil in the eyes
So I run
I start to run

I start to run, I’m still young
Not looking back from where I come
You get this life, just one time
You do yours and I’ll do mine
So I run
(Run run, run na, na na na)
So I run
(Run run, run na, na na na)

So pack your bags, we leave tonight
We won’t go down, without a fight
So pack your bags, we leave tonight
We won’t go down, without a fight

I start to run, I’m still young
Not looking back from where I come
You get this life, just one time
You do yours and I’ll do mine
So I run
(Run run, run na, na na na)
So I run
(Run run, run na, na na na)

I start to run, I’m still young
Not looking back from where I come
You get this life, just one time
You do yours and I’ll do mine
So I run
(Run run, run na, na na na)
(So pack your bags, we leave tonight)
So I run
(Run run, run na, na na na)
(We wonít go down without a fight)...
