Meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow
Meow, meow
Meow

I wish I had nine lives
I bet it feels real nice
Sitting in the sun
Letting the rays wash over me
No one watching over me
I do what I want
Everybody wants to be a cat
It's cool to be a cat
Everything the light touches
It's where I will roar
My roar would be so powerful
I would scare off everything

Cool to be a cat (meow, meow, meow, meow)
Cool to be a cat (meow, meow, meow, meow)
Cool to be a cat (meow, meow, meow, meow)
Cool to be a cat

Meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow
Meow, meow
Meow, meow
Meow
