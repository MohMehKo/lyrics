I'm your biggest fan, but I guess that's just not good enough
Is it cause I wear my hair in or because I like to play Diablo
Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking 'bout
Cause I really don't wanna have to spell it out
And next time you call me
I'm gon' sit and stare at the screen
Waiting for the call to end

You stuck me in the friendzone
That's that bullshit
I'm gonna play Diablo either way
You can go or you can go

Because I'd rather play Mortal Kombat anyway, hey
I want a love like Johnny Cage
If you're not bringing bottles I suggest you start to walk away
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can tell you've kinda got uncomfortable
So let me break it down for you
Don't call me, don't text me, after 2am
Unless you plan on giving me some
Cause I got enough friends

I will throw you in the garbage
'Cause you play too many games
I'm better off by myself
Loving you's bad for my health

No one wants to be in the
Friendzone
Friendzone
Friendzone
