Into the fire
Black skies
Filled with smoke
Darker horizons ahead

Out of the pan
And into the fire
The descent into madness

Bright as day
Dark as night
The inferno

Into the fire
Black skies
Filled with smoke
Darker horizons ahead (that's right)

Out of the pan
And into the fire
The descent into madness

Bright as day
Dark as night
The inferno

Welcome to the madness
Madness
Leave your mind
At the door, check out
Madness
Madness
Madness
Madness
