[Thundercat {Mac Miller}:]
Change anything
Love, death
{As it should}
Birth
{As it should}
Life
As it should
Death (death)
One more time, are you ready?

[Mac Miller:]
Perfection
Seduction, deception
Enough with the questions
Ooh, we running outta time, time, time

[Thundercat:]
Heavy load
Watch it all unfold

[Mac Miller:]
You promised that you'd never die
Oh, how naive of me
I wish someone could tell me why
Why it's so hard to lie from your knees
I'm down to the bottom of the bottle
Say hello forever and goodbye tomorrow
Oh

[Thundercat:]
Children of forever
Children of forever
Children of forever
[Mac Miller:] That sound is so awesome
