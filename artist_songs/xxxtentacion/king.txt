Leave me alone, I
Wanna go home, its
All in my head, I, won't, be upset if
Leave me alone, I
Wanna go home, its
All in my head, I, won't, be upset if

Heartbroken, misspoken, breaking anything I touch
I'm not in, love, I won't, let you control what I want
Hate me, won't, break me, I'm killing everyone I love
Hate me won't, break me, I'm killing everyone I love

[Screams]

HEY, YOU, HEY, YOU, YOU, WHAT, HEY, YOU
HEY, YOU, YOU, WHAT, YOU, YOU, YOU

"ITS ALL IN MY"
