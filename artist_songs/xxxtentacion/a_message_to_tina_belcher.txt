I dream so much and I just can't seem to find an answer for what I'm living for in general
I can't keep living like this, its breaking my heart day by day
I mean who's to say you find an answer when there isnt?
What if you just die?
What if life as we know it is all a dream?
What if we live for no reason?
What if we just disappear when you die?
Should I cling to life?
Or should I just kill myself?
So many contradictions, contemplation
It's getting harder and harder to mask my pain
I can't tell if I wanna live or if I wanna die
Please save me
