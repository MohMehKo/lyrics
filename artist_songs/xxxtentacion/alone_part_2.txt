I woke up with the knife in my hand, aye aye.
To murder the bitch was the plan, aye aye.
I will never surface, feelings are abundant,
Many men are of a dying breed.
Plunge the knife into his throat and suck the blood of human out it's case, dangerous.

I observe the father, walk into an alley,
Probably go in just to take a piss.
Slowly, surely, I will take position,
Without hesitation, I will grab his wrists. (YEAAA)
Chop him, buck him, fuck him,
I will stab him, scrat him, drag his body all across the map.
Shower in his fluids,
Kiss him, bite him, eat him.
When I'm through, I'm fitting in to take a nap.

Butterflies,
Kidney Stones,
Slit wrists
Vagabond.
Concubine,
I'm alone,
Very holy when I'm not alone. [x3]

Very holy when I'm not alone. [x7]
