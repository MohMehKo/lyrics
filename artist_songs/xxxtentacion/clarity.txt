Sever her buns
You take the wheel
I lost control, aye
She did it all for some clarification that you never know, aye
Give it a rest, best, chest [?] off of the what these sacrifice of us
Clarity so where is the fairer few
Will never be free of this
So I pay the fucker repent
Trifle for the foolish will not give me bank
I fucked the face of the few I resent
I flee the life without doubt in my head

She did it all for some clarity
I pray I do not embarrass her
If I am alone she is my God
And I am the devil resent from heaven [x3]

She did it all from some clarity
She did it all from some clarity
She did it all from some clarity
I pray I do not embarrass her
She did it all from some clarity
I pray I do not embarrass her
If I am alone she is my God
