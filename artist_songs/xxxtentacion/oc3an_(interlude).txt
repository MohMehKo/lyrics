Well, it looks like he's a little disoriented or something
It's always possible the guy could be on something
Get off, get off, get off...

See my reflection is vague,
Looks are deceptive
Keep changing directive
And will leave your heart in a daze
Minds in a maze,
Without a complain
I'm charging and putting the breaks
Knock knock
Who's there? young bitch
What you meant to me?
Couldn't be the same, if you vent to me
Now I pop these xans in this ecstasy
Any motherfucker
That could love a motherfucker
Could've loved another nigga
At the first, you see,
And they changing your mind
And the time, in the night
Commit a big hurt, you see
Hercules, with a heart full of darts,
Should've known from the start
Bitch fuck retard in the mind as shit
Vague as shit, vague as shit
In this ocean, yeah
Paint it red
Now you're dead, soulless
With the dead
In this ocean, yeah
Paint it red
Brain dead
Brain dead
Get off it
