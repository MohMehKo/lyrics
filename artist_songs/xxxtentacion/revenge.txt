I'll fuck you thread around everything, on everything
Your pussy was there for me, was there for me
You know what you did to me, you did to me
I'm having withdrawals, withdrawals, withdrawals
But you don't know what you stand for me, you done to me
That pussy was ecstasy, was ecstasy
You said I'm the chosen one
Your only one
I know I was wrong
Fuck, but that pussy was ecstasy, ecstasy
I want you right under me
Te amo mami
You were the one for me, the one for me
I know I did wrong, so wrong, wrong
I'll fuck you thread around everything, on everything
You knew you were everything, everything
I'll fuck with everything, everything
