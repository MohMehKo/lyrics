[ENZO!:]
Asking myself "what's wrong with my head?"
Scary mothafucka, I'm a threat
Get yourself together, put on your favorite sweater
This is the last time you'll breathe tonight
If you have one request please don't second guess
You have little time left till' you're gone
You curved me enough, fell for for all your flaws
I gotta' get even

[SANTZ:]
She thinks my charm is too much for her or maybe she just thinks I'm ugly
I think that she sees all my weakness
Flatlining her heart for this weekend
She thinks my charm is too much for her or maybe she just thinks I'm ugly
I think that she sees all my weakness
Flat line in her heart for this weekend
If I can't have her, you can't either

[xxxtentacion:]
In the dark, for the right price
If anyone else about this is right
I would drink a 5th, and she would plead the 5th
Her bodys not to be in sight
Blood down your legs, smile through the pain
Drugs always seem to tempt me
Hold up wait a minute
She gon' throw a fit
Tell me "go home"
But I'm a' take her
Eat a pound of butter
[?] honestly
The best of her is gone I know it now but throw it to me now
Girl you showin out
I'll give it to ya bitch
She better throw it out
I got it goin

She thinks I'm too much for her
But maybe she thinks I'm ugly
Maybe if I take that it's too much
Fuck her and leave her to him

I will have you
Whether you like it or not
