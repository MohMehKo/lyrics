I see Black skies, and white lies I'd rather be
Dead, filling my head with different enemies
Thoughts consuming me
Fueling my insecurities (as the ground right under me)
Crumbles if it wasn't there
It's too much
My hearts crushed
I'm not alive
I won't allow myself happiness because it's all lies
I've seen the pain
I run away so many times
Death and I are companions
He's here at all times
I won't love
Won't trust
I won't die
I can't feel but managed to steal your heart, love
It's dirt poor and I fuck whores who want love
It seems that anything offered can be enough but
It's time
Body falls so I don't know who to call at all
And my heart can't take on my broken soul
... I'm so fucking numb
My life has succumb to hate, Trinidad
Alone, in the snow
