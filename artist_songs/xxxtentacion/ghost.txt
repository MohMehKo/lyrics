My flesh is cold as a ghost
My flesh is cold as a ghost
My flesh is cold as a ghost
My flesh is cold as a ghost
My flesh is cold as a ghost
My flesh is cold as a ghost
My flesh is cold as a ghost

And I, could've been
Next fall, next blade in the king
Bleed red, four doors in the bin
But I met four ghosts in the pin
And I, could've been
Dead boy, my soul is a miss
[?] types of a kiss
Rather hate bitch
Just face the abyss
Who's to blame for this shit?
Rather be dead, throw blades on my wrist
Fucking with my head, get dead that's the gist
First you can see it on me, I'm pissed
Lost in the mist, pants full of piss
Pick a daffodilly, so pretty at this
Fist fuck, silly willy take a look
At the rope, then he jumped
All he needed was a brick
Daisy [?] Fugazi
[?] pick up a case and
Closer closer, pick up the rabies
Daisy [?] Fugazi
[?] pick up a case and
Closer closer, pick up the rabies
