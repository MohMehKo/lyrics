Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
I won't be dead, misled, ahead, I never break uh
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
I won't be dead, misled ahead, I never break uh

Lost in the pessimistic
State of perception, it's been
Hard to participate in
Natural instances, it is
Due to my history, I
Don't know what's next for me but
Keep my composure, fuck over anyone next to me yuh
Dean detriment told me love was for negligent
Motherfuckers that can't seem to keep wearing they head on
I'm not self-aware, I'm misled, I'm a hypocrite like the rest
I will kill myself if it benefit all of my fucking friends
I'm sorry mama, I didn't mean to fucking hurt you
If I had to test my worth, I'll show you heaven on this earth
So if alive or in the dirt
I swear to God, you'll be my first priority
Before the hurt, that mean for better or for worse I said
I didn't mean to fucking hurt you
If I had to test my worth, I'll show you heaven on this earth
So if alive or in the dirt
I swear to God, you'll be my first priority
Before the hurt, that mean for better or for worse I said

Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
I won't be dead, misled ahead, I never break uh
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
I won't be dead, misled ahead, I never break uh

[Kin$oul:]
Through the soulless pit, I never slip, I get a grip
My mind drift to a place, where the devil lives
My soul rise to the sky, made of abyss
With the evidence, that I made with the elements
Fuck your settlement, let's settle this now
We turn it down, we make these incredible sounds
We cherish them now
The pain that was never announced, we singin' it out
They look around confused like they ain't figure it out

[Killstation:]
Oh you can run away from everything you made
You try to erase, memories will fade
