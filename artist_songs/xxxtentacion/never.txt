Say, You said somethin
Type of one or two
A cab comes, You and I
Do or die
Skies are grey so you flew a kite
We knew
And I'll take
My lifetime everyday
So you'll awake
And I know

You, I
We die
It's so hard to take
This time, our flight
We won't ever break
It's all I know
You can't never say
You, I
We die
It's so hard to take
This time, our flight
We won't ever break
It's hard, I know
You can't never say

The end just never comes, ooohh
The end just never comes, ooohh
The end just never comes, ooohh
The end just never comes, ooohh
The end just never comes, ooohh
The end just never comes, ooohh
