Luke right on the beat!

You ever seen a nigga hung
With a gold chain
I rather sing about the same things
That we claim
Such is bashful [?]
But niggas like a task force
Mobbin on the streets and robbin stores
With ski masks, bruh
Niggas ask for peace in riot to bring violence
Cause it's a game of cat and mouse
And you gonna bleed silent
Once the justice is said [?] fuck it and grab the pump
Then kill a women and many children makes you a chump
Look at all the stores you wreckin'
Nigga I reckon
Think about the people who own it for about a second
I know you got your problems but brother they got theirs
This is not a gang, quit violence, and grow a pair
But, yo
You rather hear me say "Fuck the black President"
Let's murder different races, grow hatred, and form irrelevant
Views and etcetera
Knives thrown
Damage them lives blown
Oblivion ole cold
Oblivious
I won't dare say, that you should stop the fucking ignorance
Murder ops
Killing shit
I'd enjoy the trill of it
Bath in blood of officers
Different corpses offing them
Auction them
Don't you market them
Murder them
Never heard of them

I could preach the peace
But say fuck it and preach the murder
Cause this ain't fucking life that we living
Go ahead and grab the extension
Get [?]
Uncle, cousin, brothers, send glory to all the chosen ones
That will rid you of the innocence
But in a sense
Innocent will soon be holding ignorance
Blasphemous killing our own murdering black-

We see, I see, death before the children
White guys and white girls hanging from the buildings

We hate niggas
We hate jews
We hate faggots
And we hate spics
Hooraay!

We don't have to have a reason to hate them
Just because they breath we hate their filthy bums!

You people need to get off your ass and wake up
This is america, the niggas are taking it over and the jews
