[SZA:]
Don't come close, don't come close
You don't even know me, you think you know me

Ice under my heels, I hear it breaking
Under my heels, I hear it cracking
Foolish of me to think I had it
Emmanuel, how foolish of me
To think I had it..
I hear your voice behind me
Moving up my neck
I hear you talking
Creeping up my shoulder, breathe, breathing
In my head, I hear you screaming
Just do it
Yeah yeah yeah, I hear you talking
Yeah yeah yeah, feel you moving
Lets do it, yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah

[SZA & XXXTENTACION:]
Don't come close, don't come close
You don't even know me, you think you know me

Crucifixion, crack rock love, feeding my addiction
Pessimistic, feed her all the lies, and get self infliction
Ice lays in my dope place, without a soul, impure hate
Insecure ay, couldn't love another at the same time
Ice cold sang my lover through the grapevine
History, mystery, hate her, fuck him,
What's meant to be?
Was it pure green?
But this ice can't melt
Ice hotel

[XXXTENTACION:]
Ice, ice, ice
Feel the love in the air,
Hate what consumes from rates of the air
Hopped off, let you sleep for eight sets,
[?]
And the rest unwritten,
Ice hotel, ice, ice hotel, ice, ice hotel
