Yeah, I'm a creative genius
And there's no other way to word it
I know you're not supposed to say that
About yourself and I say things the wrong
Way a lot of times but my intention,
Is always positive
"You're... you're a genius, you really are... you're a genius"
I know

Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Ohhhhhhh
Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Ohhhhhhh

Black ski, gold teeth
Gold teeth, fingerless,
Blasphemous, wrists are slit,
I kissed the bitch,
Blood on my lips,
Holy shit, he scared the bitch,
I grabbed her bra and tell her she can,
She can... she can...

Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Oh no...
