Wrist work, uh, yuh, aye, yuh, aye, aye, yuh, aye, aye, aye

FACE PLANT! FACE PLANT! FACE PLANT!
I need love, I need drugs, I need savior
All my niggas, I got blood on my hands

FUCK out my way, Johnny Cage face kick
I might lose my mind, I can't ever love a bitch

Menace is the only fuckin' friend of me, aye, yuh
Fuck that shit, I need Hennessy, yuh, aye
Wave lookin' like mass genocide, aye

Death before dishonor I am not a pig?

Fuck my life, fuck my life, fuck my life up, yuh
Fuck my life, fuck my life, fuck my life up! [x2]
