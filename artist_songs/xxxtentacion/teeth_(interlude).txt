Where you said you were going
He can't fuck you like I can
Where you said you were going
He can't fuck you like I can
He can't fuck you like I can [x4]

I don't remember much
I just seen her dead in there
It definitely stood out
I remember your smell when I touched you
How you used to talk to me
It all hurts so much now
How could I waste so much time on someone who doesn't even love me
Even though all the time I spent, its just worthless
Now I feel like I don't even wanna live anymore
Save me
