[Nicole Dollanganger:]
I shot an angel with my fathers rifle
I should've set it free but I...
I shot an angel with my fathers rifle
I should've set it free but I...

[xxxtentacion:]
Hush little angel, don't say a word
Bottle full of pills, passed out on the curb
Sun brings heat and it just won't snow
Noose like a necklace on my neck, won't go
I have to explore because I won't understand
Blade for your cries, count a penny for my sins
Water flies off and the lake don't stream
Wrist down the river, not across with the blade

Girl your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Girl your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay

Wake up to your face
I'm straight forward, fuck a pace
What I want just so happened to be you
Couldn't picture being a moment in your shoes
When I think back to the kidney failures
Broken promise I failed
I won't deny it I held the ground you walk on
Heart stops, you walk away
You're good today
You're gone tomorrow
I carry my heart on my face, I'm so depressed
What good is sex?
I pray that you would love me less
And now it's here, hand on my chest

Girl your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Girl your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
