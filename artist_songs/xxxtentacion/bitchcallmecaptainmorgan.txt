Tempo changed trapped in the rain
Slide on my sidekick rust in the way
I been feeling lost in the dirt I stray
Running from the man with the blade I say
Look in the mirror doesn't feel any better
Magazine covers see my mum I had better
Treatments cease and it don't fuckin' matter
Big foot, big foot stomped in bones shatter
Feeling like [?] wrist dimensions
Skinny white bitches always gigged in my mentions
Put your fucking mouth on the curb [?]
Bitch tryna have me suicidal Sean Kingston
NASCAR cap put a strap to his back
Brass knuckles on my hand so I can't call back
Feeling like mean billionaire boy [?]
Fuck a gun grab a blade and your [?]

Captain Morgan, bitch I'm, gorgeous
Fish, scared
Bitch I got bail
Captain Morgan, bitch I'm, gorgeous
Fish, scared
Bitch I got bail
Bitch I got bail, yuh
Bitch I got bail
Bitch I got bail, yuh
Bitch I got bail
Bitch I got bail, yuh
Bitch I got bail
