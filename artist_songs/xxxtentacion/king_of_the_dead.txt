Ay pick up the pace, tell 'em why I ain't find no haze
Indeed I am ready, my outfit in vain
The needle in my vein, I'm falling asleep
King of the dead, I sever your head
When shit touch the river, my rain will be fed
I touch the sky and bring life to the dead
I watch my demons become super saiyan
Oh, I'm not an orphan, death is my importance
Rush, without a soul, manual fold, feeling my bones
I say again
Oh, I'm not an orphan, death is my importance
Rush, without a soul, manual fold, feeling my bones
I say again

I'm out my mind, see fear in your eyes
I'm sick, I despise myself again
The tears never come, my body is numb
I feel like a God amongst men
Cut out my eyes, feed me with lies that I don't never have to see again
I feel the hate, I feel the truth, I give the pain and the youth
Fuck the devil for your wealth, pistol chilling on my shelf
I control my own death, I don't need no fucking help
Fuck the devil for your wealth, pistol chilling on my shelf
I control my own death, I don't need no fucking help
