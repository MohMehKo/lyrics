And yet i've been cleansed with the water.
A purity no mind can grasp.
A purity so cool upon my fingertips.
The vision that i've seen: this is the action that spawns from the end.
For the longest time, i've been watching the world breathe against (spiderwebs).
What lies here are mountains composed of tombstones.
Examine these beautiful faces, keep singing now.
Keep singing.
Will we push bedlam noise to the state of blissfulness?
Display her beauty to the people.
A purity no mind can grasp.
