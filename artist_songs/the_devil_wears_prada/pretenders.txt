Never have I been so disgusted, never has it all been so clear to me. Ya....

Watch out for pretenders.

No one of any positive reputation will respect what youâ€™ve done.
Judgment will befall your rule, the wrath will break your law.
Harshness will have His place on this. You fake, you were meant to fall down.

Stop (stop), restart (restart). Baah.... Watch out for pretenders.
Obtain perspective, re-evaluate your inception. Endless imitation, obvious plagiarism.

I know how you function (I know how you function):
There will be an end to your profit, your possession.
How did it all become... become published? How can no one see these things?
How can no one see these things? You fake, you were meant to fall.
How can no one see these things? You fake, you were meant to fall down.
How can no.... How can no one.... You fake, you were meant to fall down.

And now the record went gold, but not an ounce of sincerity was achieved.
I know how you function (I know how you function):
There will be an end to your profit, your possession.
How did it all become... become published?
How can no one see... see these things?

Stop, restart. Stop, restart.
