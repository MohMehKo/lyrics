You've compromised your doctrines
You've surrendered yourself to fashion.
Come back to your faith; Come back to grace.
He sang with us and loved others.
The death of obsession.
The blood relationship, creates such a rotten demise.
Oh Lord.
Such blackness portrays the love of a machine.
I did not want you to join this culture.
So how can you be so proud?
Pray to the heavens, with whatever it takes.
I wish to shine this light back upon you.
It's obvious that apocalyptic barriers (will give) no mercy to fashion.
You've compromised your doctrines.
You've surrendered yourself now
