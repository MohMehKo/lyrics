Gravity
Teach me the ways of retaliation
I'd like every backbiter to know that audience is always priority, rather than the stage
It all comes down to this
Look elsewhere for books of narcissism 
Pride is a trend that is far past swollen 
Death through windows 
No longer can I live a life of no control 
These stories we've been writing are water-thin
It's disheartening because I know that we are capable of vision 
Blemishes are warnings so simply concentrate and apply pressure 
And it's branches will be broken 
The city to be punished 
So many never listen 
And I drown in disgust 
When you will you ever remember?
When will you realize (that) false statements fall to the feet of dead Gods?
False statements fall to the feet of dead Gods!
