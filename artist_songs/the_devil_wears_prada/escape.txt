There's no time. If your decisions include regret. Then it's already too late.
There's no time. As clumsy as these beasts may be.
Their mass numbers make up for slow speeds.
Now is when you exert all of your energy.
Don't bother screaming,
Don't bother crying,
Ignore all hope of mercy.
There's no time. If your decisions include regret. Then it's already too late.
There's no time for even the slightest bit of remorse.
Try to contain every ounce of sorrow.
Our hearts have no room for this.
I am made of anger.
There's a proportion to be met between escape and defense.
Now is when you exert all of your energy.
Don't bother screaming,
Don't bother crying,
Ignore all hope of mercy.
There's no time. If your decisions include regret. Then it's already too late.
