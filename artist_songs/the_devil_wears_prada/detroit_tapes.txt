She left through the door so long ago
If she ever comes back I will never know
Driving south down highways of Ohio

I wanted to stay her gentleman
Her broken soldier
There are vultures that you can't see

She left through the door so long ago
If she ever comes back I will never know
Driving south down highways of Ohio

I've spent decades waiting downtown
And most of my friends are gone now
They drowned at the bottom of the bottle
There are vultures that you can't see
And I'm wondering when they'll feast

She left through the door so long ago
If she ever comes back I will never know
Driving south down highways of Ohio
