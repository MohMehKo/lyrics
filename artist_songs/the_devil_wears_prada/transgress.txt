I swore to forever
And I'm sure it will happen again.
Another bend, another break.
Ceaseless habits under falling skies.

I don't know where to go from here.
I've become limitless.
That's how the story goes for me,
Not that they'll understand.

I am an apparition
And that's all I ever wanted.
That's how the story goes for me,
Between pages and handwriting.

With seven plagues,
And some roots, and a throne.
I'm back at where I started.

Didn't think it'd be like this,
Didn't think it'd be like this
Or maybe I knew all along.
I didn't see this through,
Didn't see this through,
So maybe it's where I belong.

Just you and me and you.
Just you and me and you.

Didn't think it'd be like this,
Didn't think it'd be like this
Or maybe I knew all along.

Break it.
The darkness sets in.
Another bend, another break.
Ceaseless habits under falling skies.

You, me, and you.
You, me, and you.

It won't be long for me
Or it might be forever.
This hopeless destiny:
A tragic, lost endeavor.

I'm back at where I started.

Didn't think it'd be like this,
Didn't think it'd be like this
Or maybe I knew all along.
I didn't see this through,
Didn't see this through,
So maybe it's where I belong.

Just you and me and you.
Just you and me and you.
