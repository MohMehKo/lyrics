I mean this, I'm not sure if you could say the same
Week after week after week
Idolatry is wasted reverence, idolatry is the yellow on your teeth
Gasp for the truth you once lived
Beyond this world is what is always breathing
Beyond this world is worth dying for
I remember what you used to claim
You cant bury conviction with anything
Our message will grow
No matter the mistakes made with construction
Beyond this world is what is always breathing
Beyond this world is worth dying for
Gasp for the truth you once lived
I pray that stolen glimpses wont subtract from what we've been building 
Keep stride persist in our march
