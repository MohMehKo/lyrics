With Your baby momma playa is where u can find me
Pushing through the parking lot on 24's Cadillac Escalade with the chromed out nose
With the navigation arrow headed straight to iHop
Aunt Jaimama likes me cause my syrup is so hot
Put the Caddy up, Start the 3 wheel Benz
Hyper white lights, ultra violet lens
Sumitomo tires and they gotta be run flat
T.V. where the horn go, boy can you top that? 
I'ma show you somethin rookie press that button
The trunk went Eh-eh and all of a sudden
4 15's didn't see no wire's, and then I heard boom from the amplifiers

Let me slide in the Benz with the fished out fins
Impala Loud pipes, Drinking that Hen

In the Cadillac truck 24's with 10's
Looking at my Gucci it's about that time
6 banders flying in at 9
New Suburban truck with page up showin'

Bodies on the Roadster Lexus You know with that hard top beamer
Momma that's your truck

Open up the top and I wake up the bubbley
430 lex with convertible top
The rims keep spinning every time I stop
I got a superman Benz that I scored from shaq
With a old school Caddy with a diamond in the back

Gator Boots, with the pimped out Gucci suit
Ain't got no job, but I stay sharp
Can't pay my rent, cause all my money's spent
But that's OK, cause I'm still fly
Got a quarter tank gas in my new E-class
But that's alright cause I'm gon' ride
Got everything in my moma's name
But I'm hood rich da dada dada da
