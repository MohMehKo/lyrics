Across land (across land), across sea (across sea)
We can't count the miles
The days, the weeks, the months, the years
We can't count the miles

Do you know what it's like? How is it when you fall asleep?
Have you ever been in love?
Can you explain to me
Since I keep trying to pretend, but it's better to keep quiet
Still it goes without saying that I can't help it

Across land (across land), across sea (across sea)
We can't count the miles
The days, the weeks, the months, the years
We can't count the miles now

If you wanted to trade places, exist in different spaces
One would have to erase this
