Everyday at each moment
We walk along now
We look north now
I am a victim, a willing victim
Lost in the lights now
Starting over now

Moongod, where’s your glow?
Watch from anywhere
Listen without regard
It’s what you choose, it's what you choose
In between cancer and all the fire
It’s what you choose, it's what you choose

Watch over me, inspect my mistakes
Like a beacon, necessitate my regret
In an orbit unrelenting
It will all just be, I said let it be
I wish you didn’t have to see me like this
It’s all it can be, it’s what it should be

Moongod
Watch from anywhere
Listen without regard
It’s what you choose, it's what you choose
In between the cancer and all the fire
It’s what you choose, it's what you choose

How we look to be protected without age or
Void restriction

Watch from anywhere
Listen without regard
It’s what you choose, it's what you choose
In between the cancer and all the fire
It’s what you choose, it's what you choose

Moongod, Moongod
Watch over me, inspect my mistakes
Like a beacon, necessitate my regret
