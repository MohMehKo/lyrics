Staying late for suffering.
Swaying back and forth like seas.
Staying late for suffering.
Swaying back and forth like seas.
I'm the one she'll never meet.

It's like the same thing,
You're just a little late.
I'm always hoping to maybe change.
It's like the same thing,
You're just a little late. I am away.

Staying late for misery.
I move back to you.
I move back to you.

The salt tastes just the same.
Thunder breaks overhead.
As I'm still away, we'll never meet.

It's like the same thing,
You're just a little late.
I'm always hoping to maybe change.
It's like the same thing,
You're just a little late. I am away.

It's like the same thing,
You're just a little late.
I'm always hoping to maybe change.
It's like the same thing,
You're just a little late. I am away.

Between sharks and kings,
It doesn't matter much to me.
And I'm still away.
I'm still away.

It's like the same thing,
You're just a little late.
I'm always hoping to maybe change.
It's like the same thing,
You're just a little late. I am away.

It's like the same thing,
You're just a little late.
I'm always hoping to maybe change.
It's like the same thing.

This is the sailor's prayer.
You can find love elsewhere.
This is the sailor's prayer.
You can find love elsewhere.

This is the sailor's prayer.
You can find love elsewhere.
This is the sailor's prayer.
You can find love elsewhere.
