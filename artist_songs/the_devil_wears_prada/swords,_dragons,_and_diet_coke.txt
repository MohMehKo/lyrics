Be gone with you, you articles of nothingness
I don't know what I have to do to prove myself
This audience is stern
Grey is what has risen from the pits
Choose a new medicine to control it

You thought you had me fooled
The grey, is what has risen from the pits
You thought you had me fooled
The grey, is what has risen from the pits

My lady, let us waltz
We can ignore the firearms
Guns manufactured by fear

And I will never be forgotten
I will never forget you
And I will never forget you
I will never forget you
I will never forget you

With dead tongues and lonely hearts
We cough the poison out
And yet, I sing a song of hope

With dead tongues and lonely hearts
We cough the poison out
And yet, I sing a song of hope

Your final days approach

This will be our final confrontation
This will be our last
This will be our last
