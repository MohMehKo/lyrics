Over a lifetime
I never loved her
My daughter, my daughter

Seems to be a distorted shift
I'm lost now, I'm lost
In the universal absence
And it is dizzying, dizzying
Pitch black, pitch black
Over a lifetime
I never loved her
My daughter, my daughter

Before there were
Ships sailing under a swollen moon

But enough now, enough
Every memory awakens an agony
But enough now, enough
Every memory awakens an agony

Over a lifetime
I never loved her
My daughter, my daughter
Over a lifetime
I never loved her
My daughter, my daughter

I keep carrying the dead with me
So let us pity them, bury them all at once
I keep carrying the dead with me
So let us pity them, bury them all at once
