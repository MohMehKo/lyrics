The normal man, promised all things
Brought into this, taken by pain
He mistook home for grave
The normal man, filtered by hate
Living to pay, buying what's fake
He mistook home for grave
It's not what we're made to be
So why'd he do it?
I guess he just did not know
I guess we just do what we're told
The anthem cries, but why listen?
I guess we just do what we're told
Betrayed again, betrayed again
What began as life for him was only sorrow, was only shame
It's like the story of disgrace
Fraught with peril every day
So why'd he do it?
I guess he just did not know
Given nothing, left so lonesome
He mistook home for his grave
It's not what we're made to be
So breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
I guess we just do what we're told
The anthem cries, but why listen?
I guess we're just do what we're told
Betrayed again
What began as life for him was only sorrow, was only shame
It's like the story of disgrace
Fraught with peril every day
I guess we just do what we're told
Betrayed again, betrayed again
I guess we just do what we're told
The normal man passed away
Dead and gone
