Every light is red tonight
Every day: a useless fight
Burdened by obligation
This life will be named “The Condition”
Bound beneath the reign of the viper
And with that please cross me out
Let me out of this everlasting ice age

Can't look forward to anything while in this condition
Can't say I'm waiting for a sign
I'm not waiting

The mystery is there is no mystery
Overlooked reason to history
Founded by abandonment: an emptiness defined by silence
Let me be free
Float away like dots in the sun
Let me be free

Can't look forward to anything while in this condition
Can't say I'm waiting for a sign
I'm not waiting
