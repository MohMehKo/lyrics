I know a ghost
And when doubted his truth reveals incredible vengeance 
Vanity is a sepulcher 
Do as you please, shame will fallow
Languages rot and insects lose interest; 
Mountains of plastic: melting away
As long as these struggles are aimless,
We will all be standing still
When worded correctly, truth is never a cliche;
This is because so many are attached to their deaf ears 
Collect the leaves 
Count them
Name them
Study each and every single one of them
As long as the struggles are aimless
We will all be standing still
When worded correctly, truth is never a cliche;
This is because so many are attached to their deaf ears
All mistakes can be marked by borders 
All of love can be traced to a maker
It seems as if what is most important,
Isn't noticed when forgotten 
Do as you please, shame will fallow
The sun and the moon:
You'll always take them for granted 
What's delicate is lost
As the selfish forgot what is sacred,
The humble forgot themselves 
When worded correctly, truth is never a cliche;
This is because so many are attached to their deaf ears
