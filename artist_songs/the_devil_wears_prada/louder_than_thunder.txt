What would it take for things to be quiet?
Quiet like the snow.
And I know this isn't much
But I know I could, I could be better.

I don't think I deserve it;
Selflessness, find your way into my heart.
All stars could be brighter.
All hearts could be warmer.

What would it take for things to be quiet?
Quiet like the snow.
Are we meant to be empty-handed?
I know I could, I could be better.

I don't think I deserve it;
Selflessness, find your way into my heart.
All stars could be brighter.
All hearts could be warmer.

What would it take for things to be quiet?
Find your way into my heart
What would it take for things to be quiet?
Find your way into my heart
What would it take for things to be quiet?
