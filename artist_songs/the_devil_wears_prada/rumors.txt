Rumors break down to a future of failure.
Leaving me like this. Digging deep
In the nothing that I Have.
In the nothing that I Have.

Will I find encouragement
Hidden behind false ambition?

You were the one I never knew.
You were the one to fix what's left here.
You were the one I never knew.
I can't tell if I Want this to last.

Another day dies, trailing off.
Another day dies, trailing off.
You were the one I never knew.
You were the one to fix what's left here.

Hungry wolves haunting me.
Gold fading on rooftops.
Handsome wings left to fade.

So it goes. The narrative is unending.
Death is here, love is sending.

You were the one I never knew.
You were the one to fix what's left here.
You were the one I never knew.
I can't tell if I want this to last.

Another day dies, trailing off.
Another day dies, trailing off.
You were the one I never knew.
You were the one to fix what's left here.

(Rumors break) down to a future of failure.
Leaving me like this. Digging deep
In the nothing that I have.
In the nothing that I have.

Will I find encouragement
Hidden behind false ambition?

Digging deep in the nothing that we have.
