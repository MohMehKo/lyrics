Promise the lake
Don’t try, don’t be
Exist just like me
Promise shame
Every bit of everything is screaming so quietly

Is there anything else to say?
Are there any more words to sing?
Right after doubting all the things you claim
Right before giving all of it away

I thought I was ready to write
But you had me years ago
You had me at first sight
Even if it means nothing now

Promise these hands
No more empty praise and worship
Get lost at first sight
I’m driving my car away
I’m heading north

I thought I was ready to write
But you had me years ago
You had me at first sight
Even if it means nothing now

It hurts most in the mornings
And I wish I was in Chicago
Their statements are all contradictions
And I don’t think they can figure it out

All our damages transform us
We’re like our own historians
Is there anything else to say?
Are there anymore words to sing?

Every bit of everything is screaming
Promise the lake
Get lost at first sight
