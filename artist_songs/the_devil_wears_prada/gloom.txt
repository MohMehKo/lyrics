We wrote a song in the dark.
We drove a stake through her heart.
We ride the wind, we ride the waves.
We are aggression, we are pain.

We wrote a song in the dark.
We drove a stake through her heart.
He is the Lord, we are the listeners.
We will not die without a whisper.

I've seen what's fake,
I've seen the distraction.
And like a wick there's no end.
I've seen what's fake,
I've seen the distraction.

No end to my burning.
No end to my burning.
No end to my burning.

Don't let the devil speak.
Don't let the demons take us.

Watch your back, look over your shoulder.
This war is meant to be fought.

I've lost my temper.
And yet there's forgiveness,
There is purity.
Lay waste to golden crowns,
Find hope in clarity.

Let go.

We wrote a song in the dark.
We drove a stake through her heart.
We wrote a song in the dark.
We drove a stake through her heart.

Black heart, black song.
