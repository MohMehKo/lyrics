We will not be forgotten: Holdfast. Holdfast.

I will never subject myself to the flames.
You are a demon to me, your power is but a fraction of me. (but a fraction of me)
And with that I... I make progress, within each step I move.

Save me, for the waters have come up to my neck. (come up to my neck)
We will not be forgotten.
Glory to the patient and to those who have hope. (to those who have hope)
We will not be forgotten.

Studying photos and deleting pictures.
With bleeding clouds ahead we pray for boldness,
we pray for boldness, we pray for undying grace.

Save me, for the waters have come up to my neck. (come up to my neck)
We will not be forgotten.
Glory to the patient and to those who have hope. (to those who have hope)
We will not be forgotten.

No... I donâ€™t plan on going anywhere without you. Holdfast. Holdfast. Holdfast.
My body was meant to rot, but these words will never pass.
Bless the Lord, oh my soul, for these words will never pass.

Save me. Save me. Save me. We will not be forgotten.
Save me. We will not be forgotten. Holdfast. Holdfast.
Save me. We will not be forgotten. We will not be forgotten.
Save me. We will not be forgotten. Holdfast...
