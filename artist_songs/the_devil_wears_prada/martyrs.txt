Martyrs

Oh. 

I know I'm always here,
And I will always beg,
'Forgive us'. 

It's just that I am
I am always gone.

So we'll start with a question:
Why's this on me?
What's this have to do with faith?
It will always be 'us and me'...
I'm just sick of being

LONELY,

Like the winds and her faint breeze,

LONELY,

Like the church to 'set me free'.

I'm dead to those who tried to impress,
I'm dead to those who had my trust,
I'm dead to distance and to home,
I'm dead to me; I died by the Throne.

MARTYRS
MARTYRS!

Martyrs, hear me out:
Never claim what's not forever.

Oh. 

Never claim what's not forever. 

Judas, watch us weep.
(Watch us weep!)
Live and die, by your betrayal.

More doubts to be answered.
When is the Lord's hour?
There will always be 'us and me',
I'm just sick of being

LONELY,

Like the winds and her faint breeze,

LONELY,

Like the church to 'set me free'.

I'm dead to those who try to tried to impress,
I'm dead to those who had my trust,
I'm dead to distance and to home,
I'm dead to me; I died by the Throne.
[repeat]

MARTYRS
MARTYRS!

Martyrs, hear me out:
Live and die by your lover's heart.

Why's this on me?
Why's this on me?

MARTYRS
MARTYRS!

Martyrs, hear me out:
Live and die by your lover's heart.
Live and die by your lover's heart.
