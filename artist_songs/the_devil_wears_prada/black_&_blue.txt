I would like to learn
So I could do something.

Slaves to phones, abandoned homes.
Can you see this? Can you feel this?
It seems it's only obvious to me.
It seems it's only obvious to me.

From the grounds of time,
Can you see this?
And in the times of pain.
Can you feel this?
We cannot ignore
Can you see this?
What we need to hate.

You say your words like you're on repeat.
Why is it that you're so empty?
Watch the minutes pass, admit defeat.
We can't ignore.

Just watch her breathe.
Broken hearts, torn apart.
It seems it's only obvious to me.
She hasn't heard a thing.

Just watch her breathe.
She will never know alone:
A faction of blackened tongues.

You say your words like you're on repeat.
Why is it that you're so empty?
Watch the minutes pass, admit defeat.
Will you admit defeat?

You say your words like you're on repeat.
Why is it that you're so empty?
Watch the minutes pass, admit defeat.

I would like to learn
So I could do something,
But no one really knows
Exactly what I mean.

The blood that binds pours through you.
Blinded eyes soon black and blue.
The blood that binds pours through you.
Blinded eyes soon black and blue.

You say your words like you're on repeat.
Why is it that you're so empty?
Watch the minutes pass, admit defeat.

We cannot ignore what we need to hate.
Can you see this? Can you feel this?
Just watch her breathe.
