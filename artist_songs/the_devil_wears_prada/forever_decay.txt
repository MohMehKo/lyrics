Goodnight, farewell, our grace has met its end.

Forever in ruin, forever decay.

She fell in love with the city, and since then I don’t mean anything.
Forever in ruin, forever decay. Forever in ruin, forever decay.

Forever in ruin, I can’t just disappear. Forever in ruin, I can’t let go.
Forever in ruin, forever decay. I can’t see anything but you.
