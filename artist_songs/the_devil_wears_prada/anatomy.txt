With contamination comes fever:
The disease is at its worst.
Teeth missing, Beyond repair, 
Fragile flesh falling away.
With fever, with virus comes the harshest judgement.
Haunting elements create a horrific monster. 
You've never seen such grey skin, freezing to the touch.
This is a call to arms, Human race.
With contamination comes fever:
The disease is at its worst.
Immune to water, Immune to weather all to spread the curse.
Bones brittle ready to snap, mind unstable highly enraged.
Dirt underneath the nails of fingers tearing at your sanity.
There is no changing structure,
There is no retracting anatomy.
This achitecture, It cannot be destroyed.
There is no retraction.
Close your eyes, but nothing changes.
We all know what brings this on.
Close your eyes, still nothing changes.
No one knows how to take it back.
