An extraneous existence
An earth-ending challenger
Encroaches upon humanity
Destruction, destruction they’re seeking destruction
Each ten feet tall, without remorse

Crawling along the walls
I see the eyes, I see the teeth
See the monster coming through the window
Closing, the doors are closing
I see the eyes, I see the teeth
See the monster

One cannot fathom such a phantom
The demon’s mouth hisses with acidic saliva
Acidic saliva

Crawling along the walls
I see the eyes, I see the teeth
See the monster coming through the window
Closing, the doors are closing
I see the eyes, I see the teeth
See the monster coming through the window

Game over, we’re done for

Crawling along the walls
Claws extended
No hope to persevere
Closing, the doors are closing
We’ve been surrounded
There’s no way out
Game over, we are done for
