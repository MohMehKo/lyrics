Dear tomorrow
Find some sensibility
Respond to emotion

Dear politician,
Define sagacity,

One after another, nobody stands behind the ones they have chosen
One after another, nobody stands behind the ones they've selected
Nobody stands behind the nation they've selected

All chances of survival are beginning to, beginning to diminish
Comedy is no excuse for our own blasphemies
Mass media, mass pessimism, mass denial
My television tells me to panic, but I don't think I'll listen
The apathetic force us to persevere
The apathetic, with their backwards priorities
If only the strongest of stone was not necessary

One after another, nobody stands behind the ones they have chosen
One after another, nobody stands behind the ones they've selected
Nobody stands behind the nation they've selected

We could build a monument for memory:
Liberation includes a failure
Your rebellion is resultless
So, be angry at yourself
If only we did not deserve this

Your rebellion is resultless
So, be angry at yourself, yourself.
