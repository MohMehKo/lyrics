Keep this on your mind
Keep it within your eyelids 
We have ascended countless stairs 
Perhaps it has interrupted our thoughts
Regret is an inception, regret is a beginning 
Miles and miles of wires build the apparatus 
But don't mistake power lines for shelter 
I forgot and it will more than likely happen again
Drink and binge the waters of the sea
Keep this on your mind,
Keep it within your eyelids
Don't climb for a lifetime only to fall short of infinity
Everything is left
With faith, some minds are sand; 
But I prefer concrete 
This is whats going to separate us from them
Time for the next chapter
Keep this on your mind
Keep this within your eyelids
