Confidence blurred by arrogance
And the self worship continues
Who is an artist?
You can't decide for yourself
Straight lines, I see straight lines
But they control sloppily, stupidly
Keep that golden, celebrity character to your own conscience
Take a breath and rest your jaw
A vertebrae with no spine
Our entertainment: a mockery 
With every laugh and every joke the actors lungs become more dense with damnation 
Don't mistake my intentions for superiority, lets make that clear
This isn't right and the worse part is we're not pretending
Don't memorize these names
Eternally
This world will run dry and we'll watch the clock
We'll watch what we'll become 
Don't memorize these names
Eternally
Take a breath and rest your jaw
A vertebrae with no spine
