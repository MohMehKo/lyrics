The idea is simple, to be underwater
Hold my breath, sink deeper
Say a prayer, sink deeper
You might consider this surrender, but I'm descending:
Constructing a most pleasant ending

I can still see the city, I can still recognize
To remain is to be separated
I can still see the city, to carry on is to be divided
I can still redefine
I've been spending time trying to keep outside of the light
I've been spending time at the bottom

You would not believe how true the salt feels
Oh God, the relief of oceanic sleep

I can still see the city, I can still recognize
To remain is to be separated
I can still see the city, to carry on is to be divided
I can still redefine

The clich√© says that it's sink or swim
But that's another lie we've been drowning in
