Welcome to the war; a martyr's challenge 
Chainsaw brutality tornado strength 
King of the diamond; king of the grave 
Lawlessness stains black on whitewashed tombs 
We're too strong to compromise 
Don't be ashamed of your faith 
Dear Lord - deliver me from hypocrisy and surcease the scarlet desire 
He wears a slick jacket and gold watch 
Her dishonesty has scarred hands
