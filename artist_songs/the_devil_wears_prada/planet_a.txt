Uh, control for gateway
Orbit arm retracted, out
Roger, Houston
We have G.L.S. confirmation of fuel and main engine check
Roger control, How are we looking for that 11: 20 launch time, over
Looking good, commander, weather is first rate
Copy that Houston [radio cuts] Roger
Auto-sequence start in T-minus 30 seconds, gateway
Visors closed
External vent closed and hydrogen pressure building for takeoff
Roger, over
Gateway, this is Control, you are go for launch. Countdown management switch to on-board systems, over
We are go for launch, over

Radio check, go
Where shall we begin?

Not long ago, a young girl knew what she wanted to be
So she trained and she learned to travel and explore the unknown galaxy

Elizabeth had a dream
Maybe like you, maybe like me
Mankind searched the universe
Curiosity can be a curse
Elizabeth had a dream
Maybe like you, maybe like me

Exploration expanding
A dire mission withstanding
Far away a ship flew interplanetary
Elizabeth, the commander, she wasn't ready
For the malfunction, for the malfunction
The shuttle had been off
It was unprepared, it wasn't fit to fly
"Houston!" she screamed
"Houston, we've been breached!"

There was a survivor, just one survivor, without anyone
Without anyone

Elizabeth had a dream
Maybe like you, maybe like me
Mankind searched the universe
Curiosity can be a curse
Elizabeth had a dream
Maybe like you, maybe like me

A woman lives far away on an unknown planet called "A"
There was a survivor, just one survivor, without anyone
