It was you and me
Girl on top of girl
Us against the world
We were caught between
Heaven and the earth
Us against the world

And we were dancing in summer rain
I knew we would end in pain
Wishing I could keep you
Thought we knew everything
Now you're just a memory
But baby I still see you

By the oceanside
With your hand in mine
My heart won't forget
I recall your laugh
Caught in photographs
My heart won't forget
My heart won't forget
My heart won't forget

When the sky was pink
Sun was gonna set
Hope you don't forget
When you turned to me
Looked at me and said
"Hope you don't forget"

And we were dancing in summer rain
I knew we would end in pain
Wishing I could keep you
Thought we knew everything
Now you're just a memory
But baby I still see you

By the oceanside
With your hand in mine
My heart won't forget
I recall your laugh
Caught in photographs
My heart won't forget
My heart won't forget
My heart won't forget

It's you and me holdin' on to summer dreams
And I don't wanna let you through
It's you and me holdin' on to summer dreams
And I don't wanna let you through

Under summer sun
I remember love
My heart won't forget
My heart won't forget
My heart won't forget
