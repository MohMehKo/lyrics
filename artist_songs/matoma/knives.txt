I know love that keeps me calm at storms
And keeps the blood inside me warm
Wherever I go it never leaves
Like a suitcase of memories

I know love is stronger than I am
It beats me up, and keeps me trying
And when I can't it fights for me
From boy to man, and in between

I remember backpacking by the water
Late days I've seen the bottom
Free falling two words from the night is over fire pits
Who's got the words to my mistakes
I hope you heard what I meant to say

There will be times when it rains on you
I'll be the light that you can hold on to
And on the day when I turn to dust
I hope you know just how much I love you

I know a love that looks me right in the eyes
Helps me see beyond boundaries and lines
And there's a better side of me
Sometimes it's all I need

I remember backpacking by the water
Late days I've seen the bottom
Free falling two words from the night is over fire pits
Who's got the words to my mistakes
I hope you heard what I meant to say

There will be times when it rains on you
I'll be the light that you can hold on to
And on the day when I turn to dust
I hope you know just how much I love you

This love I've found lost it's lesson
In my way or believes in impression
What has been paves the road for what's to be
With every step I take I'll let it be

I remember backpacking by the water
Late days I've seen the bottom
Free falling two words from the night is over fire pits
Who's got the words to my mistakes
I hope you heard what I meant to say

There will be times when it rains on you
I'll be the light that you can hold on to
And on the day when I turn to dust
I hope you know just how much I love you
