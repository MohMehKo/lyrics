When I'm with you it's like all I need
Someone to wait it out, and catch the WAVE with me
Maybe you are what I'm waiting for
So, bring me the summer with you babe
And let's catch that wave.

Pool party at the Montreal
Everybody here still thirsty
Half niggas thoughts on Beyonce [?]
I got that girl way, I see them all put in work for me
It's like they want that girl great
It's like they know what's good,
Got them Sundays on me with Miami great hits
Next day won, got me no sleep
Next time I go hard, I'm all forever [?]
I pray you to take me back 'cause you all I've got.

Maybe this time you'll be all I need,
Someone to wait it out, and catch the WAVE with me, ooh
Maybe you are what I'm waiting for
So, bring me the summer with you babe,
And let's catch that wave.

Yeah, the next day will be like yesterday
So ain't gotta wait for tomorrow
My only ID is my resume, so we're packing our chicks in the SUV
Man, I'm on that girl way
I see them all putting in that twerk for me
It's like they want that girl great
It's like they know what's good
Got the party in here, I ain't looking for a wife
Six in the morning, 'bout that Hollywood life
This time I go hard, and my boy Matoma bring that party my height
But you know it, yeah
Bet that every corner is another [?]
And another chick with another guy
Yeah
I pray you to take me back 'cause you all I've got.

You, 'cause I'd be rubbing and kissing and loving and hugging in my room
You're a part of me
Yet today and under [?]
You, you're a part of me
'Cause I'd be rubbing and kissing and loving and hugging in my room
I'm giving my heart babe
I'm going in

Maybe this time you'll be all I need,
Someone to wait it out, and catch the WAVE with me, ooh
Maybe you are what I'm waiting for
So, bring me the summer with you babe,
And let's catch that wave.
