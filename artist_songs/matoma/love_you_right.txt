I know that you're the freak of the week
You coming on, show here the nerve
You harder than a fever, but you know, you know, you know
Like a sweet, sweet melody
Just want to get along for the thirst
You got me falling so deep, so deep, but you know, you know, you know

Hey, damn you baby, so fine
Damn you baby, so cold
I got this fantasy
Girl, put your body on me
Hey, damn you baby, so fine
Damn you baby, so cold
I got one fantasy
Just put your body on me

Oh woo, wahwah
I wanna hold you, I wanna kiss you
I wanna love tonight
I said, oh woo
I said, wahwah
I wanna hold you, I wanna kiss you
I wanna love you right
Hey, I said, oh woo
I said, wahwah
I wanna hold you, I wanna kiss you
I wanna love tonight
I said, woowoo
I said, wahwah
I wanna hold you, I wanna kiss you
I wanna love you right

I know it's not my birthday
But I just wanna take that cake for a ride
You got me thirsty, a sip of your love and I'm off in the night
How you got me feeling
If it was after me, I'd be all over you
I don't know how, but you got me sprung and I love this so

Hey, damn you baby, so fine
Damn you baby, so cold
I got this fantasy
Girl, put your body on me
Hey, damn you baby, so fine
Damn you baby, so cold
I got this fantasy
Just put your body on me

Oh woo, wahwah
I wanna hold you, I wanna kiss you
I wanna love tonight
I said, oh woo
I said, wahwah
I wanna hold you, I wanna kiss you
I wanna love you right
Hey, I said, oh woo
I said, wahwah
I wanna hold you, I wanna kiss you
I wanna love tonight
I said, woowoo
I said, wahwah
I wanna hold you, I wanna kiss you
I wanna love you right

I said, oh woo
I said, wahwah
I wanna hold you, I wanna kiss you
I wanna love tonight
I said, oh woo
I said, wahwah
I wanna hold you, I wanna kiss you
I wanna love you right
