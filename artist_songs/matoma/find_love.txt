You've been so far away
We'll got a pleasant day, yeah
You'll get the best of me
So, hey, come on over here, babe
You've been too far away
Remember yesterday
But, hey hey, it's all that matters to me
So, hey, I've got something to say

So, come on, let me know
If you can't find love
Let me know
If you can't find love
Come on, let me know
If you can't find love
Just give it up, 'cause you've got my love.

I'll take you far away,
To somewhere we can play
But, hey hey hey, no matter what it takes
So, girl, I've got something to say!

So, come on, let me know
If you can't find love
Let me know
If you can't find love
Come on, let me know
If you can't find love
Just give it up, 'cause you've got my love.
