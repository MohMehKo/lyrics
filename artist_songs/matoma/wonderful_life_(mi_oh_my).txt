Mi oh my, when the light hits your smile
There's a fire that ignites at the bottom of my heart
Ooh mi oh my, if we open our eyes
I think we're both gonna find that it's a wonderful life

Mi oh my, it's a wonderful life
It's wonderful life with you by my side
Mi oh my, it's a wonderful life
It's wonderful life with you by my side
Mi oh my, it's a wonderful life
It's wonderful life with you by my side
Mi oh my, it's a wonderful life
It's wonderful life with you by my side

All of our friends, feet in the sand
Beneath the stars it never ends
And we got no explanation cause there's no expectations
Just beautiful faces and nowhere to go

Mi oh my, it's a wonderful life
It's wonderful life with you by my side
Mi oh my, it's a wonderful life
It's wonderful life with you by my side
Mi oh my, it's a wonderful life
It's wonderful life with you by my side
Mi oh my, it's a wonderful life
It's wonderful life with you by my side

Mi oh my, when the light hits your smile
There's a fire that ignites at the bottom of my heart
Ooh mi oh my, if we open our eyes
I think we're both gonna find that it's a wonderful life
