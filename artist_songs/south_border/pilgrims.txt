I was walking down the road
Of broken dreams
Where leaves piled up to
From a lonely hill
Street signs hanging
With names of people long forgotten by the living
Some things were never meant to be

I was walking down
The road of broken dreams
And came an old man saying
There's a way outta here
"Walk after, go after, run after
Where the children play"
And then I understood
Oh... oh... ohhhh
It's somewhere

Every way is gone
And I'm out here on my own
And life's saying never
To dreams that I never knew
And all that I can see
Are birds that are so free
While they fly

And I lay down
While I pray that there could be
Another view of seeing things
And remember the old man saying
"Walk after, go after, run after
Where the children play"
Amd I shook my head
Oh... oh... ohhhh
It's somewhere (somewhere)
