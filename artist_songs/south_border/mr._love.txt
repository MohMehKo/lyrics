Mr. Love, Mr. Love, you will never find another
Mr. Love, Mr. Love, you will never find any love like mine

Feel the heat, summer's here
Lookin' at the babe from a to z
I can see the body sweatin'
Fallin' through the lines my mind's sweepin'
Hoop there it goes
Candy like sweet vanilla mixed with ice
So all you girls stop thinkin'
Come with Mr. Love and get it bumpin'

Take you down on the floor
Let my body explore ya' all the way
And find a place to move inside Inside
Out here we go
You and I overflow
C'mon and let me feel the love
That's never endin

'I want you for myself
And I don't want to share
You with somebody else
It's gonna be one on one
Go ahead scream and shout
No one could help you out
So what you're gonna do next
C'mon face me

Mr. Love, Mr. Love you will never find another
Mr. Love, Mr. Love Come and hold my hand
Take you to Disneyland
Take you down on the floor
Let my body explore you all the way
And find a place to move inside
I want you for myself
And I don't want to share you with somebody else
It's gonna be one on one
