Keep on thinkin' about you
You're always on my mind
Can't explain what I'm feelin'
You got my heart and soul
On the line

Feel feel the love
That's waiting for you
Flow let it flow
Right there in your heart
Kiss kiss me gently
And tell me
You're for me
And I'm for you

Groove me, baby
Groove me, right
I want to be with you
All through the night
Love do me baby
Hold me tight
I want to be your lover
For the rest of
Rest of my life

You really got me crazy
You're all I'm livin' for
Can't stand without
You near me
Want to be with you
'Till the break of dawn

Feel feel the love
That's waiting for you
Flow let it flow
Right there in your heart
Kiss kiss me gently
And tell me
You're for me
And I'm for you

Groove me, baby
Groove me, right
I want to be with you
All through the night
Love do me baby
Hold me tight
I want to be your lover
For the rest of
Rest of my life
