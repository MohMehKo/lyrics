Some things never change
Some things will remain
Yet i always hope and pray
That i could change the day
And maybe find a way
To make you come to me and stay

[chorus:]
Yesterday doesn't matter
Tomorrow you may not ever know
(tomorrow i just might be gone)
So listen to me now
As i try to say
That all i want is you today

If you only knew
What you put me through
You might not have gone away
Have you ever felt even for a while
Something's missing in your life

[repeat chorus]

That all i want is you today
If you don't need me anymore
Don't say it, if you don't love me anymore
Don't show it, because this life i have is short
So maybe you could try for now to love me again

[repeat chorus]

All i want is you today
