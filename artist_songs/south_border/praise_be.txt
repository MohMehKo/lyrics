You are the inspiration
You fill imaginations
You, the meaning of true love
You're always there
When we are down
You never take away the sound
Oh, Lord we come to you

We're nothing without you
We bring you back the glory
We give our lives to you

Praise be, praise be
(I want to thank you Lord)
(I want to love you Lord)

To the only Lord Jesus Christ
