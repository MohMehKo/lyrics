Everybody come listen up now
Gotta let you know what life is all about
Never be afraid let your feelings show

Nothin's wrong when you keep dreaming on
But you gotta let your heart and mind be one
Hold your head up high don't be insecure

[Refrain:]
Hold on to your dreams, don't throw it away
Never let go of it come what may

[Chorus:]
Together we will fly
We'll never say goodbye
To dreams that lead us to
A better me and you

The future looks so bright
If we just hold on tight
Tomorrow we will sing
The best that we can be
