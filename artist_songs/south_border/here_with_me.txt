Ain't got no time for love
That's what I said
Before I met you girl
And I can't believe

This is happening
It's a dream
Come true for me
What more can I ask for?

You're the light
That shines on me
And all I can do
Is to love you

Everything's so right
Everything's so fine
Everything's so cool
It's like a paradise
When you're here with me

So come and feel me now
Just try to answer
What I'm whisperin'
In you heart

If you ever feel the same girl
Then just touch me
And then warm me
With your sweet caress

You're the light
That shines on me
And all I can do
Is to love you

Everything's so right
Everything's so fine
Everything's so cool
It's like a paradise
When you're here with me
