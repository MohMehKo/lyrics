You are my compass
I'll go wherever you lead me to
You are my journey

At your heart's doorstep my road ends
Let's make a fire
So our hearts burn and melt as one
You're my desire
Your beauty just makes you next to none

Don't go back to our darker days
Brighter times are comin our way
I turn myself into your embrace
Nothin's gonna keep me from fallin back into Your Space

We'll both discover
If things aren't what they used to be
Truth will uncover
There could be only you and me
There's no one but you
I've tried every inch of possibility
Our moments together oh
Were the ones worth remembering

Fallin back into Your Space...
Fallin back into Your Space...
Fallin back into Your Space
