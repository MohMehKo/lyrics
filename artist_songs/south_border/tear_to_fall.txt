I see you again
Funny but you're holdin'
Somebody else's hand
You again
Don't you know that you
Made a hole in my heart

Oh girl I've been so blind
Hopin' that the sun would
Shine right by my side
And now I feel like cryin'
But tears gone dry

There will be no tear to fall
No more tears to show
I'll just keep holdin'
The pain inside
Till it just goes away

Time goes by
But I still can't get you
Out of my mind
Though I've tried
Leaving all
The memories behind

There will be no tear to fall
No more tears to show
I'll just keep holdin'
The pain inside
Till it just goes away

There will be no tear to fall
No more tears to show
I'll just keep holdin'
The pain inside
Till it just goes away
