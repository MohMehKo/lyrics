I wish that you were with me now
It's hard to go on
Knowin' that you're far away from me baby
I need you here by my side, feelin' so strong
I never really knew how much you mean to me

[chorus:]
Every minute of every hour of everyday
This is somethin' not hard to say
I can't live my life without you
Every teardrop, every pain,
Every moment is not the same
I can't be used to bein' alone

I wish that you were here with me now
It's hard to move on
Knowin' that you're far away from me baby
I really need your love right now, helplessly somehow
Memories of you haunting me baby.
[repeat chorus]

I wish that you were here with me now
It's hard to go on
Knowing that you're far away from me baby
I am sure that one day you'll be in my arms
This is our destiny, you being with me.
