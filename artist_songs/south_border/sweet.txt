Yah, haha there's another one (another one)
From the jd factory
Something brand new
You gonna love it
Brownhand record baby. Whooa!

Ohhh. Baby boy
When you warp your arms around me
You rock my world
Ohhh baby boy...
Honey suckin' sweet
Lovin' all day
Baby, baby, baby yeah

So soft and smooth
As any girl could be
Those stylish moves
And curve of your body
We got tripping' bumping'
Dancing to this beat
Get your booty
Down on me

Boom! When you step into the room
Time stood still like I'm walking on the moon
I've been checking you out, you're so tight
When you looking at me, feels alright
Is this real, what a feeling
What am I to do I'll be tripping?
First I saw you then I felt you
Now I got you, it's sound crazy
You know but it's true ha-ha!

Ohhh. Baby boy
When you warp your arms around me
You rock my world
Ohhh baby boy...
Honey suckin' sweet
Lovin' all day
Baby, baby, baby yeahh

So soft and smooth
As any girl could be
Those stylish moves
And curve of your body
We got tripping' bumping'
Dancing to this beat
Get your booty
Down on me

Love the way you laugh
When we tickle
Love the way you sound
When we giggle
Love the way you walking and talking
Love your pretty face, you know your expression
Love the way you taste you a dish
You want temptation girl, I can't resist
I can't believe that I'm yours and your mine
We got sweet love till the end of time

Ohhh. Baby boy
When you warp your arms around me
You rock my world
Ohhh baby boy...
Honey suckin' sweet
Lovin' all day
Baby, baby, baby yeahh

Ohhh. Baby boy
When you warp your arms around me
You rock my world
Ohhh baby boy...
Honey suckin' sweet
Lovin' all day
Baby, baby, baby yeahh

Ohhh. Baby boy
When you warp your arms around me
You rock my world
Ohhh baby boy...
Honey suckin' sweet
Lovin' all day
