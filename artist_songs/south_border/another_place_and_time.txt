Will there be a time
When you and I will be together?
I'm wishin' on a star tonight
Baby I need you
But you know that it would be
So hard on me and you
But I just can't stop pretendin'
You are mine

What is it about you?
My dream had never
Been this cool
Too bad I'm bound
With you

In another place
In another time
In another place
In another time

Should I stay this way?
Or should I forget
This crazy thing?
That blows in me
Girl if you can't see
Would it be easy
For me to carry on
With so much emptiness?
Things aren't right
Without you here
By my side

What is it about you?
My dream had never
Been this cool
Too bad I'm bound
With you

In another place
In another time
In another place
In another time
