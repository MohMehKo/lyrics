Tell me that you love me for one last time
Let me be the one u need for the night
I know that it makes me feel just like dyin'
But it's just a way to ease me when I'm cryin' hard
I longed for you & I to be in love for all time
But now you seem to drift away
Now your love has come to an end

Let me kiss & hug you for one last time
Tell me this is just a dream runnin' deep in my mind
You know that I just can't stand life without you
It's hard to face reality believing you are gone

If only there's a way
To win you back someday
I'll care for you like I never cared before
Say you will stay

For the one who changed my life
For the one who made me cry
For the one who'll never die in me
Faithfully I will remain

I longed for you & I to be in love for all time
But now you seem to drift away
Day by day, it's too late
Now your love has come to an end
