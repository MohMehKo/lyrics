[intro:]
Ooh yeah yeah yeah
Is this what you think about me, ama change that

Could you be my baby, you're so fine
I really wish that you could spend some time with
So you'd see the real me, that i'm the man for my lady
I'm gonna find a way to start a conversation
I really gotta stop the hesitation
It's hard to be me, the way they see me
Everybody thinks i'm crazy,
It really has to go, the way they think, the way they 
Think
About me, i'm really feeling fine
And i can't deny, that you're so sexy and your beauty
Fills me with desire, i just wanna know if you really 
Feel my flow

[refrain:]
Girl you are my desire, i'm always dreaming about 
You,
You and that perfect smile,
Can't get enough so don't go away
I don't care what they think, gotta believe in me
Girl i'm a changed man, girl ama be straight
Give me a chance.

I don't give a damn on what they say [x2]

Don't confuse yourself, no no
Like what my peeps say, i ain't a player
But i've been there, done that and gone past that
So you better believe in me
Gotta know that you give me an overdose of ecstasy
That's what you do to me
Coz that shapely body just drives me crazy insane
Don't blame me baby girl coz
That tempting flesh can be deceivin'
Coz i heard you don't play around, sleep around
Just, just like me now and i think that we should work things
Out
Start the 'bout
If you're down with that, just hella back.
