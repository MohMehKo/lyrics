I love to see the ocean's beauty
And the moon that shines above
Alone in the sand looking at the stars
Wishing someday i would find true love
Would it be nice to see the morning
With the one you love the most
Would it be nice to say goodnight
To the one you hold so close to your heart
To your heart.

[chorus:]
The wind that blows the dove
Is the wind that blows my love
Hope it'll find its way to you wherever you are.

I love to sit in fields of green
Looking deeply through the sky
Watching birds as they fly by
Hoping someday fate will bring me true love.
Would it be nice to hold someone
So dear, near your heart
Would it be nice to hear those words
I love you from the one that you love,
That you love.

[repeat chorus]

[bridge:]
I'd love to see myself one day
In the arms of someone
Who will share her life with me
Selflessly… someday…
You will find your way… to me…
[repeat chorus]
