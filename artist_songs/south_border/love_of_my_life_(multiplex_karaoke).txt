Ooooohhhh...
Love of my life
Destined forever
I will be right here by your side
No falling tears
When where together
You know the joy you bring to me
There'll be no other
We'll share as lovers
Right from the heart
From my mind to your soul
I will give it
To you girl
My every little thing
That I'm more than willing
I will give to you
Forever starts from now
I promise you
Loving you is all that I can
Do...
No one can take it away
From me nobody...
But you...

Oooohhhh...
Now is the time
Stars will be bright
Our bodies will groove all through the night
Come take my hand
Then we will fly high...
Come on baby
Hear me say...
There'll be no other
We'll share as lovers
Right from the heart
From my mind to your soul
I will give it
To you girl
My every little thing
That I'm morethan willing
I will give to you...
Forever starts from now
I promise you...
Loving you is all that I can do...
No one can take it away
From me nobody...

There'll be no time
For us to say goodbye
Without you here
I can't go by
Don't you go away

There'll bo no other
We'll share as lovers
Right from the heart
From my mind to your soul
I will give it
To you girl
My every little thing
That I'm more than willing
I will give to you
Forever starts from now
I promise you...
Loving you is all that I can do...
No one can take it away
From me nobody
But you...
Forever starts from now
I promise you...
Loving you is all that I can do...
No one can take it away
From me nobody
Oooohhhh...
Its got to be you
Baby! baby!
Cause your my lady
