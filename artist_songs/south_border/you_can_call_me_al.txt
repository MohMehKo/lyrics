A man walks down the street
He says why am I soft in the
Middle now

(Why am I soft in the middle)
The rest of my life is so hard
I need a photo-opportunity
I want a shot at redemption
Don't want to end up a cartoon
In a cartoon graveyard
Bonedigger, bonedigger dogs in
The moonlight
Far away my well-lit door
Mr. beerbelly beerbelly
Get these mutts away from me
You know I don't find this stuff
Amusing anymore

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you betty
And betty when you call me
You can call me al

A man walks down the street
He says
Why am I short of attention
Got a short little span of attention

And wo my night sincerely are so long
Where's my wife and family
What if I die here
Who'll be my role-model is
Gone. gone

He ducked down the alley
With some roly-poly little bat- faced
All along along there were
Incidents and accidents
There were hints and
Allegations

A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the third world
Maybe it's his first time around
He doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is sorrounded by the sound, the sound
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity
He says amen!
And hallelujah!
