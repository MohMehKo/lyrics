Yeah, there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow (remix)

[Chorus:]
Life's beautiful
Hold on to your dreams cause
Everything possible
Just keep a flame burning in your heart 
This is where to start yeah

They say the rest is on the other side
But everything will always be alright
Look for the silver lining 
This life just like a big wheel turning
Round and round it go
Will it stop
I guess nobody knows
If we make mistakes we really gotta face it
We gotta face the truth and man embrace it
Life is not always what it seems to be
But things don't always turn out 
The way they should see
Nothing really is impossible 
All you need is strong mind body and soul

[Chorus x2]

There's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
