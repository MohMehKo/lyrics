HOW CAN YOUR FACE BE SO ANGRY
WHEN ALL YOUR DOING IS LOOKING AT ME
YOU CHASTISE ME FOR MY BEHAVIOR
IT`S GONNA LAST TOO LONG

AND WHAT AM I NOW BUT YOUR REACTION
I`M ALL THOSE MEMORIES
YOU TRIED TO STEAL
THIS WAR WILL NEVER BE OVER
GONNA LAST TOO LONG 

YOU`RE STILL A FUCKER
YOU`RE STILL A FUCKER
YOU`RE STILL A FUCKER, TO ME

YOU KNOW, LUCIFER CRIED
WHEN YOU LOOKED AT ME
AND THE HEAVEN`S RAINED DOWN
ON YOUR ACID FACE
WHAT`S LEFT NOW THAT IT`S OVER
SHOULDN`T LAST TOO LONG

NA, NA, NA,NA,NA,NA, NAAN

IT FEELS SO REAL
AND IT FEELS SO REAL 
BUT IT`S ALL THE SAME
IT IS ALL THE SAME, WHAT A LIFE [X2]

AND I BELIEVE I BELONG NOWHERE
MAYBE THERE ARE WINNERS
BUT I`M ALWAYS USED
EVERYTHING`S HARD TO DISCOVER
WHEN IT LAST TOO LONG

[REPEAT CHORUS]
