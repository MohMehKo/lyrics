Why take everything you see?
You have nothing left to squander
If you keep pushing me away
You have no one left to love

You throw it all away
Look tease you anthem suffer for
you cause disaster
squander squander squander squander

Why take everything you see?
You have nothing left to squander
If you keep pushing me away
You have no one left to do love

you're less than you should be
what runs so hard to finish I
you could contendement
squander squander squander squander

Why take everything you see?
You have nothing left to squander
If you keep pushing me away
You have no one left to looooove, looooove
Why squander squander squander squander

Why take everything you see?
You have nothing left to squander
If you keep pushing me away
You have no one left to, no one left to love
