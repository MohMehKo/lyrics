With my heart in your hand
I will suffer, suffer
'Till the bitter end, yeah

With my heart in your hand
I feel troubled, troubled
Smutter who I am, oh oh

What a rushing
Spirit moving
Darkness comes
I feel magnificent

I'm sinking in, the love has failed
The world goes crushing down to hell
I try, I try

I'm breathing in, I'm chocking out
All sentiment has faded out
Just died, died

I see death for the lovers

With my heart in your hands
I will stager, stumble
And shatter 'till I'm gone, yeah

With my heart in your hands
I speak my distraction
To give you what you want, yeah

What a rushing
Spirit moving
Darkness comes
I feel magnificent

I'm sinking in, the love has failed
The world goes crushing down to hell
I try, I try

I'm breathing in, I'm chocking out
All sentiment has faded out
Just died, died

There were days when we were sparkles in the air
We were musical, two souls without a care
Now the photographs come crushing to the ground

I'm sinking in, the love has failed
The world goes crushing down to hell
I try, I try

I'm breathing in, I'm chocking out
All sentiment has faded out
Just died, died

There were days when we sent sparkles in the air
Now those days are gone and I sung solitaire

I'm breathing in, I'm chocking out
All sentiment has faded out
Just died, died

I see death for the lovers
Death for the lovers
