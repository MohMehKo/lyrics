Your future's where your friendly day
Then it's coming to feed you in your head
Going slow, you'll yearn the most
Still it's coming to fing your holly throat
So let me tease your silver scare 
That you're willing to suck on 'til you sore
Maybe caught the ore request
So then fingers will a shiney home
Slide into you head
Side into your head
I'll find a way,into your bed
Slide into your head
When the dawn is breaking free
And it's getting too hard for rellary
Slip and smile your good time here
And u're felling the lips of care free lives
Everybody upside down
'Til they're weeling to take a holy crime
Rolling chicks, the big time here
And I'm willing to spend all this time
Jack knife ginal
Where the jail? [x4]
