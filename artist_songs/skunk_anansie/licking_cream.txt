Corrupt my hope
In joyous hell
Between the lines
Lick cream that smells

I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(Crawling down my spine to make u stay)
I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(Covering my eyes to make you pay)

Beyong the high
Lies burning eyes
Crashed down to spell
Fucked up and coiled

I wish yo u weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(Crawling down my spine to make u stay)
I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(Covering my eyes to make you pay)

Too beautiful

You want to feel it
But you can't reveal that
Concieved the meaning
And caress the demon

All those callous eyes
How they infect your world
So u pretend to reason
But u've lost your soul

I wish yo u weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(Crawling down my spine to make u stay)
I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(Covering my eyes to make you pay)

I wish yo u weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(Crawling down my spine to make u stay)
I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(Covering my eyes to make you pay)
