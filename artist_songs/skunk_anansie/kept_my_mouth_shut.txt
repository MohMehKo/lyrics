What a fool I am
A fool I am for telling you the truth
What a fool you are
A fool you are for lying to yourself

What a day this is
You and I so silently inflamed
What a day this is
Your saddened and life worn face
It kills me twice, it kills me twice
It kills me twice, it kills me twice

And now I'm watching you
Wanting and a wishing that I kept my mouth shut,
That I kept my mouth shut
And now I'm watching you
Wanting and a wishing that I kept my mouth shut
That I kept my mouth shut

What a sin I am
That way I show my unconditional love for her
What a sin I am
A sin I am to hurt, I'm here to blame,
I`m here to hurt, I`m here to blame,
I`m here to blame

[Repeat Chorus]

I`m drifting in the misery of hindsight I`m drifting in the misery of hindsight

[Repeat Chorus]
