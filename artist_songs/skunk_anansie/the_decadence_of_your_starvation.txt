You don't remind in mean nothing to you
I'd like to be like, to have the chance to
Feel I like I don't want it like it means
But I was born to fat, can't get out of that
So now I compensate you feel
I swan around designer shit
But babe I am easy to get laid
By the suculent and the luscious so I'd like to think
But they just drain my face, oh I don't feel a thing
The decadence of your starvation [x2]
I'd like to be like that [x2]
The concequence of your elation 
There are times when I feel that my life
Is just one big excuse for you to
Feel complete all those trapidate
I sit all for, is it all for you
Is the intermitant conses all about you babe
Sick baby
My lyrics are so fertile when they don't exert some sentiment
Don't believe, you can't even read
So you said that I'd pretend for all
Everything you are, you've been here before
Now, 'cause my turns bigger free
The decadence of your starvation [x2]
I'd like to be like, like to be like that
The concequence of your elation
