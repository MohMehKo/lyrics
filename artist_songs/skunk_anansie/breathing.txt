I know your days are closing
Cool days we've said our hopes said
I don't know what you find
But there only breath away
You want to grieve forever
I hope we'd grieve together
Truth is we're out of time
'Cause we're only a brath away
Suddenly everything's blinded by your lies
No-one thinks, no-one joined lips to make it right
We want to laugh forever
Lived days to full, together
Truth is we're out of time
'Cause we're only a breath away
