I wanna wake up to you.
I wanna satisfy myself.
Feel the drain within you.
I wanna be a better girl
Cos I'm
Coming for you.
I wanna sanctify your life.
Be pure empathy.
I'm wanna burn inside your mind
Cos I'm

Felling The itch.
I'm felling it bad.
Felling it burn inside my bed.
I'm felling the itch.
It's making me sad.
I'm feeling it burn inside my head.

I wanna promise to you.
I wanna be the best you've had.
Be a girl again.
Be a woman with no past.

Felling the itch.
I'm feeling it bad.
Feeling it burn inside my bed.
I'm feeling the itch.
It's making me sad.
I'm feeling it burn inside my head
I'm feeling the itch.
It's making me bad.
Feeling it burn inside my bed.
I'm calling it quits.
It's making me sad.
Feeling it burn inside my head.
My head

Head, inside my head, inside my head.
