Cold blood, broken smile that is all that I have to give
Your eyes are looking up, so distorted,
From the hate of us all, in disgrace
Who am I to know all your dreams now ?
There`s no mystery in this world anymore,
And who`s the fool of fools, and who`s the enemy,
Who would crush all the hope, in your face, in your face

I dont believe your world anymore, I dont believe anymore
I dont believe your world anymore, I dont believe anymore

So, all the words are dead
Nothing seems now undiscovered ??
I believe like I`ve never done before,
That you`ll always be, always be, always be one of my friends
I dont believe your world anymore, I dont believe anymore
I dont believe your world anymore, I dont believe anymore, anymore

And I try to believe, believe, I`ve been watching you, I`ve been watching you
All of my life, all of my days, tell the world

I, I, I dont believe your world anymore, I dont believe, anymore
I dont believe your world anymore, I dont believe anymore, anymore
I dont believe your world anymore, I dont believe anymore
I dont believe your world anymore, I dont believe anymore, anymore
Loverly, loverly, loverly, loverly, loverly
