THE SWEETER THE TASTE I LOVE IT
EATEN YOUR GUTTED SPINE
ALL OF YOUR THOUGHTS I HAVE THEM
SPITTING THEM OUT, SUBLIME

`COS I AM THE GOD OF POWER
POLITICAL TO THE CORE
GOVERNMENTS ROLL THEIR HEADS OUT
THE BEAST ALWAYS WANT SOME MORE

I LOVE IT, HE LOVES IT, 
WE LOVE YOUR APATHY
WE CRUSH YOUR LAME SPIRIT
WE LOVE YOUR APATHY

LOVE-ER-LY, OH

I HAVE THE INFORMATION
THAT KEEPS YOU FROM KNOWING ME
I ABUSE YOU AS YOU WATCH ME 
AND YOU ALWAYS VOTE ME IN

THE POORER YOU ARE THE BETTER
THAT GIVES ME MORE CONTROL
COS` I AM THE BRUTE THAT HATES YOU
AND I`M LOVING IT TO THE BONE

[REPEAT CHORUS]
