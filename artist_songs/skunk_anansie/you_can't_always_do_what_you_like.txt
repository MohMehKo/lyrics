I feel emotion
Messing around with my head
Obscene devotion
Chasing me back to your bed

I feel a danger
Wondering hunting for souls
You turn to face me
Secretly eating me whole

You can be right
You can't always do what you like
You can stay high
It would always make you feel better

I hear your weapons
Shooting me waiting to fold
Nothing can happen
Love always drives out the cold

Stand still face me
Search in my eyes for your truth
Nothing will phase me
Only the frightened will move

You can be right
You can't always do what you like
You can stay high
It would always make you feel better

You can be right
You can't always do what you like
You can stay high
It would always make you feel better

Obscene devotion
Taking me back to your bed

You can be right
You can't always do what you like
You can stay high
It would always make you feel better

You can be right
You can't always do what you like
You can stay high
It would always make you feel better
It would always make you feel better
