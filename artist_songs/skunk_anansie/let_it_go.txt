Two coloured eyes, blind race of ice
Unturned my swallowed intent, fucking my sense up, interrogance
he fist will hold my world let `em go, into his world
Let `em go, you know, you`ve got to let them ride,
You`ve got to let `em ride, let `em ride

Now all my days, I feel restraint
Since who am I ? My kindest words, 
But no more time to feel content,
My time means, means more than you!

And let it go
I won`t be you and let it go
You`ve got to let it ride, let it ride, 
you`ve got to let it ride, oh, oh

How pathetic I solace, I will never comprehend
How I`m falling, falling from the truth, oooh

Let it go, into his world, let `em go into his world
I`ve got to let it ride, got to let it ride,
I`ve got to let it ride, got to let it ride, you know
Got to let it ride, I`ve got to let it ride,
I`ve got to let it ride, I`ve got to let it ride, I`ve got to let it ride

Two coloured eyes, blind race of ice
Unturned my swallowed intent
