Well, it feels like summer
Well, it feels like home
Though the days burn hotter
Your heart grows cold

As summer kills the sun
We're half way gone
And now
Our summer kills the sun, gone

Well, it feels like trouble
When their words ring dull
As my face sweats fever
Idle tongues suck gold

As summer kills the sun
We're half way gone
And now
Our summer kills the sun, gone

As summer kills the sun
Our hearts lay dead and burned
Our summer kills the sun, gone

Sun
Sun, sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun, sun, sun

As summer kills the sun
We're half way gone
Our summer kills the sun, gone

As summer kills the sun
Our hearts lay dead and burned
Our summer kills the sun, gone

As summer kills the sun
We're halfway gone
Our summer kills the sun
We're gone, gone

As summer kills the sun
Our hearts lay dead and burned
Our summer kills the sun, gone

Sun
Our hearts lay dead and burned
Sun
As summer kills the sun
Sun
Baby I'm gone

Sun
Our hearts lay dead and burned
Sun
Our hearts will never learn
As summer kills the sun, gone
