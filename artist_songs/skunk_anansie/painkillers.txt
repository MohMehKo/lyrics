Isn't there the same effect
Down to claimb the stain
Throw me just another week
Cling onto reality
I find the others standing
Additives are banging
Love to stop demanding
I did it for yourself
My unexpected power
Gets stronger by the hour
I don't have to suffer
You did it to yourself
Sucking up to click away
You wishing life would waste away
You won't make the same mistake
