Wake me up before the dawn
There's a shivering inside my craving bones
Shaking off my darkest thoughts
There's a brand new day to ruin to the call

I fall down
I can't get by without you
I can't get by without you
You're all that I can feel

It's you inside of me
I can't get by without you
Can't get by without you
And memory cuts too deep
It's you inside of me

I walk out to face the rhythm
There's a beating in my heart
I need to end

I fall down
I can't get by without you
Can't get by without you
You're all that I can feel

It's you inside of me
I can't get by without you
Can't get by without you
The memory cuts too deep

It's you inside of me
Can't get by

All that I need
You're all that I need
You're all that I need
You're all

I can't get by without you
I can't get by without you
You're all that I can feel
It's you inside of me

Can't get by without you
Can't get by without you
And memory cuts too deep
You inside of me

Can't get by without you
You're all that I need
Can't get by without you
You're all that I need
You're all that I can feel
You're all that I need
You inside of me
You're all that I need
