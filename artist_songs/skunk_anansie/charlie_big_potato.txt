I AWAKE
FROM BLOOD THICK DREAMS
WASHING BLAME
FROM MY KNEES
SOFTLY DONE
SO SECRETLY
I'M AWAKE
AS CHARLIE SLEEPS

A LONE BROTHER, A LONE SISTER
A HOME COVER, ALONE

I AWAKE
DRY THE SCREAM
SPIT THE VILE BREATH
TILL MY TONGUE BLEEDS
THINKS IT'S ALL GONE
FAMOUSLY
BROKE THE HARD GIRL
GOOD TO PLEASE

TELL IT LIKE IT IS
TELL IT LIKE IT IS
TELL THE SORDID TRUTH
TELL THEM
TELL IT LIKE IT IS
TELL THEM
