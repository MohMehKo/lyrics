SAVE ME FROM CRITICAL ACCLAIM
SAVE MY SMILE IT`S TOO CRACKED FROM FAME
WISH ME WELL WITH MY FANTASY
FEEL MY ARROGANCE WITH YOUR SANITY

WASH ME OH SO PAINFULLY CLEAN
DISECT MY WORDS WITH A FIST FULL OF YOUR DREAMS
BUILD ME UP AND STRIKE ME DOWN PLEASE
SIGN MY NAME, SIGN MY NAME

IT TAKES BLOOD AND GUTS TO BE THIS COOL
BUT I`M STILL JUST A CLICHE [X2]
JUST A CLICHE [X4]

COLOUR MY VIEWS IN RED, WHITE AND BLUE
I`M WIDE AWAKE NOW, WIDE AWAKE NOW
I KISS YOU, I KISS YOU, BUT I`M FALLING DOWN
AND ALL MY FRIENDS ARE CROWDING AROUND

THEY`RE CROWDING AROUND LOOKING TO SEE
BUT ALL THEY CAN SEE IS ME, ME, ME
SO BLOW ME AWAY NOW, WITH YOUR SCREWED UP MIND
THERE`S NO CHARM LEFT NOW, FOR YOU TO FIND

I SEE YOU, YOU SEE ME
AND WHO THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO BE
I DON`T CARE NOW BUT I KNOW THAT I SHOULD
WASHING AWAY, LIKE I KNEW I WOULD 

IT TAKES BLOOD AND GUTS TO BE THIS WAY
BUT I`M STILL [X8]
