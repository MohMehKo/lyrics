If you handle what you dream
So satisfied it seems
The apple of your eye

I still wondered over him
Your taste has sunken us in
Possessed you will come find

I'm a victim of your love
I'm a victim of your love

Now I feel your trail of lies
Has burned into my thighs
That's thanks a lot for your

Hunts me down in my distress
You and the means you've quest
The apple of his eyes

I'm a victim of your love
I'm addiction, you're the drug
I'm a victim of your love
I'm a victim of your love
The victim of your love

Come along and figure
I'm in ravel of the light
In silent blank, in black me

Work your fingers, neverÂ [?]
It shall be end to my crimes
In darkness you will shine

I'm a victim of your love
I'm addiction, you're the drug
I'm a victim of your love
I'm a victim of your love
The victim of your love

You said you wanna be
You said you wanna be
Free to breath in quietly
Now see this gasoline
On fuels for all to see
The dream is there
The dream is there
The dream
The dream
The dream

I'm a victim of your love
I'm addiction, you're the drug
I'm a victim of your love
I'm a victim of your love
The victim of your love
