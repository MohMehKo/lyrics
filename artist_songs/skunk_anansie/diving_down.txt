I should be walking on air
But I'm drowning with my
Hands around your neck
The current is strong
Should I take you with me
Breath forever gone
I should have broken my fall
I should stand up for myself
For what is worth.

You are all I see
As I lose my grip
Still I keep on diving
Keep on diving down down down

I should be floating on air
But I'm falling slowly
Drag you down the well
Moment is long
No one stays to watch my black parade to hell
All sentiment gone
I will stand up for myself
For what is worth.

You are all I see
As I lose my grip
Still I keep on diving
Keep on diving down down down

Cause there's a rope
That I see
There's a rope
Coming back to me
Cause there's a hope
That I see
Coming back back back

Still I keep on diving
Keep on diving down down down

You are all I see
As I lose my grip
Still I keep on diving
Keep on diving down down down down
