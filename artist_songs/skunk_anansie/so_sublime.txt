Whatever happens, happens... go!
You know I have no reasons for being wit today
I had my ?? addicted and I`m having it all today
My elegance is taunting, successful to the split
Obsessive and ??, cause my ego says I`m a shit
And it`s so sublime how I waste your time
Yes, I know I find it easy, but I`m having it all my way

The fragiler you`re feelin` , too tender for your toes
Obsessive, crap behaviour and these circular bums that vote
And it`s so sublime how I waste your time
Yes, I know I find it easy, but I`m having it all my way
My way... Na,na,na,na, na,na,na,na, na
Na,na,na,na, na,na,na,na - na
Na,na,na......

And it`s so sublime how I waste your time
Yes, I know I find it easy, but I`m having it all my way [X2]

So sublime hey hey hey
