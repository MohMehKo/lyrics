I`d see what you want to, 
I`d see where you`ve been,
It`s where I wanna be
Cold shoulder, black sweat now, 
No fear in these deeds
It`s what I wanna give
But my heart loves me still, 
I succumb to it`s will
Still I find you and you`ll see wherever you go,
I`m always behind you 
And you`ll see me and believe, wherever you show,
I`m one face behind you, ever, ever, wherever you.....

That silver is whining, succeed to destroy,
Where I wanna hide
No liquid above me, cold hands that lie,
Where I`m gonna die

But my heart loves me still, 
I succumb to it`s will
Still I find you and you`ll see wherever you go,
I`m always behind you 
And you`ll see me and believe, wherever you show,
I`m one face behind you, ever, ever, wherever you GO,
Wherever you go, wherever you go, wherever you go

But my heart loves me still, 
I succumb to it`s will
Still I find you and you`ll see wherever you go,
I`m always behind you 
And you`ll see me and believe, wherever you show,
I`m one face behind you, and I`ll find you and you`ll see,
Wherever you go I`m always behind you,
And you`ll see me and believe wherever you show,
I`m one face behind you, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
Wherever you go
