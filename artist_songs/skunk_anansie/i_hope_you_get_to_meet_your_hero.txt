I should have run, before the tears
Than stand alone, dead in front of you, eyes without a view
I should have known and faced my fears
This bitter juice, churns inside of me, secret enemy

I hope you get to meet your hero
I hope she never lets you down
I hope she never tears you heart out
Or runs away without a sound
Or lets you down
Lets you down
Lets you down

I wanna scream, till lungs are raw
You slew the dream, right in front you of me, you and her and he
I walk away so I can die
Out of your view, I lose my sanity, fate discovers me

I hope you get to meet your hero
I hope she never lets you down
I hope she never tears you heart out
Or runs away without a sound
I hope you get to choose your weapons
And fire first without a cause
I hope you get meet your hero
I hope she's what you're waiting for
Lets you down
Lets you down
Lets you down
Lets you down
Lets you down

I hope you get to meet your hero
I hope she never lets you down
I hope she never tears you heart out
Or runs away without a sound
I hope you get to choose your weapons
And fire first without a cause
I hope you get meet your hero
I hope she's what you're waiting for
Don't let her down
Don't let her down
Don't let her down
