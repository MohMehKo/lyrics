Mister me
Ego queen
Struts around me
Painted jeans
All I wanted was
Someone to rely on

I see you
You don't see me
Nothing burns like your empathy
All I wanted was
Someone safe to lean on

I will stay
But you should leave
You go find what you're looking for
‘Cause I've found me

You stand tall
So I stand down
Blood stays wet beneath
This cold crown

All I wanted was
Someone blind
To guide me
Maybe to hide in

I will stay
But you should leave
You go find what you're looking for
‘Cause I've found me

I will stay
But you should leave
You go find what you're looking for
‘Cause I've found me

Come back to me
All I wanted was you

I will stay
But you should leave
You go find what you're looking for
‘Cause I've found me

I will stay
But you should leave
You go find what you're looking for
‘Cause I've found me
