Yeah I see it everyday
How the sun shines from your face
But it's finding, yeah it's finding
You slowly burn away

Leaving fragments from you door
Of a soul I used to adore
Now I'm blinded, yeah I'm blinded

Beauty is your curse
Beauty is your curse
All starts slipping away
Every single day

Beauty makes you hurt
Beauty is your curse
It all starts jumping away
Every single day

Now you brush them off your feet
Tiny dick and pieces of me
'Cause you're blinded, you're blinded
Ego freak in the mirror

And the taste of richer tongues
In your mouth it was a drug
So you're blinded, so blinded

Beauty is your curse
Beauty is your curse
All starts slipping away
Every single day

Beauty makes you hurt
Beauty is your curse
It all starts jumping away
Every single day

I don't mind 'cause I'm a freak
And I don't care what happens to me
Take your time and move it all now
So c'mon now
So c'mon now
So c'mon now
So c'mon,  c'mon,  c'mon

Beauty is your curse
All starts slipping away

Beauty is your curse
Beauty is your curse
All starts slipping away
Every single day

Beauty makes you hurt
Beauty is your curse
It all starts jumping away
Every single day
