You pretend the spell has broken
goods were spoilt from the start
no complaints I release my claim on your heart
NOW I CAN FORGET YOU COS I'M OVER THE LOVE
KARMA CAN PROTECT YOU COS I'M OVER THE FUN
I NEEDED THE SHAME, I NEEDED THE PAIN
I NEED TO FEEL NOTHING FOR YOU
NOW I CAN FORGET YOU COS I'M DONE
You can bite, the fist that feeds you
lose your fight with some scars
you defend spilling blood and rain let it ride...right
YOU THROW IT ALL AWAY
