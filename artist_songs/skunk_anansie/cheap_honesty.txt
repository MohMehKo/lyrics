I KNOW TOO WELL
I KNOW THESE LINES
I'VE SEEN THEM SMOTHERED
IN SLEEK RIDICULE

A SEEDY SMILE
THEY THINK THEY'VE SCORED
BUT I KNOW MORNING COMES
AND BABES A::

BRIDGE
ALONE AGAIN, TOO ALONE AGAIN

SO WHAT CAN DO
WITH CHEAP HONESTY
YOU'RE GIVING ME MORE THAN I CAN SEE
BUT I'M TOO COOL TO SAY
THAT I WANT IT ALL MY WAY
GET BLASTED BY THIS SINCERITY

I WISH I HAD
THE STREETS FULL VIEW
THESE PEOPLE SCREAMING
THROUGH THEIR SETTLED LOVES

SO I PRETEND
SO MELLOWED OUT
TOO TEASING
WEAK ENOUGH TO LONG FOR

HOME AGAIN, LOVERLY HOME AGAIN
