In a little while you`re gonna call me
There`ll be nothing I can say
In my head there`s nothing cool today, 
I only feel regret
Yet I`m out on a limb now, 
`Cos you`re so discreet

In a little while you`re gonna call me
And hear me cry for a week
I won`t be you, I won`t be you now
La,la, la,la, la,la
I won`t be you, I won`t be you, now

On another day I could`ve been brave,
Could`ve faced you broad and strong
I`d stand firm and you would listen when I`d say
"Yes, I have made mistakes!", 
But I made them a new doll,
And that I`m so happy now
That great future is a while away, 
Today I stand all wrong
I can`t be you, so I won`t be you now
La,la, la,la, la,la
I won`t be you, I won`t be you now, now

Could`ve been brave, could`ve been strong
I can`t be you, I won`t be you now
la,la, la,la, la,la
I won`t be you, I won`t be you now
la,la, la,la, la,la
I won`t be you, I won`t be you now
la,la, la,la, la,la
I won`t be you, I can`t be you, now
