I CAN`T WEEP, ONLY CRY
I CAN MOVE, I DENY
SEE MY SMILE, EAT,EAT,EAT
FE, FE, FEED YOU SO DAMN SWEET

SHE`S CAL-LING, SHE`S CAL-LING
SHE`S MY HEROINE, SHE`S MY HEROINE

FINGERS GOING DOWN, DOWN
SHE`S MY HEROINE

YOUR TOO WEIRD
CREEP,CREEP,CREEP,
SMILY FACES SO DISCRETE
LA, LA,, LOVER, EVIL EYES
I CAN`T SLEEP FOR HER LIES

SHE`S CALLING, SHE`S CRAWLING
SHE`S MY HEROINE, SHE`S MY HEROINE

FINGERS GOING DOWN, DOWN
SHE`S MY HEROINE

SMASHED YOU IN THE FACE
UP AGAINST THE WALL 
STILL YOUR SECRET`S SAFE
THERE`S NO ONE I CAN CALL

SHE`S MY HEROINE [X4]
