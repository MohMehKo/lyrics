I SMOKED THE SHIT THAT MADE YOU LOVE
DROWNED ALL YOUR PROBLEMS LIKE A WIFE
BLANKED OUT YOUR ANGER WITH MY FACE
WASTED MY DAYS TO HIDE DISGRACE

I DID IT ALL, DID IT ALL
ALL IN THE NAME OF PITY 

YOU LOVED TO TAUNT ME WITH YOUR SEX
KICKED UP THE MEMORY IN MY HEAD
WATCH MY NEUROSIS BUILDING UP
SWALLOWED THE TRUTH YOUR MIND FORGOT

YOU DID IT ALL, DID IT ALL
ALL IN THE NAME OF PITY

YOU TRIED TO DRAG ME IN AGAIN
SPINNING YOUR LIES AND YOUR SUFFERING
TOOK ALL YOUR THOUGHTS AND TURNED THEM SANE
(SO) YOU COULD BELIEVE YOU`RE NOT TO BLAME

YOU DID IT ALL, DID IT ALL
ALL IN THE NAME OF PITY

WHY [X8]

YOU TRIED AND TRIED TO USE MY LIFE
TO KEEP YOUR AGGRESION TRIVALIZED
NEVER AN EGO IN CONTROL
(BUT) NOW WHO`S THE SHIT THAT SOLD HIS SOUL
