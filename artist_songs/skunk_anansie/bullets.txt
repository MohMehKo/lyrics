You won't stop breathing
He's always kind of get in your way
His eyes are sieving
He is settled up and ready to raid

So when you think about your life
Think about the life you wanna save
He won't stop breathing
He's going to get you anyway

See the man with the girls
And the bullets for his fancies
A knife in the fight
He knows nothing is going to stop him

Nothing is going to stop him
Nothing is going to stop you either
Nothing is going to stop him

The seeds are growing
The fillers are for new girls to crave
Life ain't worth living
When godliness is better than pain

So when you think about your cause
Think about the cause you want to save
He won't stop breathing
She's going to get you anyway

See the girls and the girls
With no vision for themselves
See the light in vulgar eye
She know nothing is going to stop her

Nothing is going to stop her
Nothing is going to stop you either
Nothing is going to stop her

He won't stop breathing
He's going to get you anyway
Won't stop breathing
He's going to get you anyway
Won't stop breathing
He's going to get you anyway
You won't stop breathing
He's going to get you anyway
You won't stop breathing
He's going to get you anyway
You won't stop breathing
He's going to get you anyway
You won't stop
Won't stop
Won't stop
Won't stop
Won't stop
Won't stop
Wow

See the man with the girls
And the bullets for his son
Cease a knife in the fight
He knows nothing is going to stop them

Nothing is going to stop them
Nothing is going to stop you either
Nothing is going to stop them
