I never wanted you to go
I only want to change the picture
Should I deflate and suffer blows
Now I've seen devil eyes within your bewitcher
Should I stand by you

There's nothing I can say
To satisfy you
There's nothing I can say
But go your lonely way
There's nothing I can do
To satisfy you

No way to save your stubborn soul
I'll save the diamonds in my mirror
Only your gods will ever know
I am the jewel you'll never splinter or fracture
Should I stand by you

There's nothing I can say
To satisfy you
There's nothing I can say
But go your lonely way
There's nothing I can do
To satisfy you

Well it feels like tonight
I'm gonne lose, I've got to choose
Yeah it feels like tonight
I'm gonne lose, so all I wanna say is "fuck you"

There's nothing I can say
To satisfy you
There's nothing I can say
But go your lonely way
There's nothing I can do
To satisfy you
Go stagger your own way
Do what you wanna do
There's nothing I can say
To satisfy you
