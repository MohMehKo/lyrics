SURVIVED, TONIGHT
I MAY BE GOING DOWN
COS EVERYTHING GOES ROUND TOO
TIGHT, TONIGHT
AND AS YOU WATCH ME CRAWL
YOU STAND FOR MORE

AND YOUR PANIC STRICKEN
BLOOD WILL THICKEN UP, TONIGHT

COS I DON'T WANT YOU
TO FORGIVE ME
YOU'LL FOLLOW ME DOWN
YOU'LL FOLLOW ME DOWN
YOU'LL FOLLOW ME DOWN

SURVIVE, TONIGHT
I SEE YOUR HEAD'S EXPOSED
SO WE SHALL KILL
CONSTRUCTIVE MIGHT
S'RIGHT
AS YOUR EMOTIONS FOOL YOU
MY STRONG WILL RULE

I WON'T FEEL RESTRAINT
WATCHING YOU CLOSE SENSE DOWN
I CAN'T COMPENSATE
THAT'S MORE THAN I'VE GOT TO GIVE
