I never called you a liar
Till you slayed the truth
You said you'd set me on fire
Well you just scorched my roots

I never was a believer
In your bloated kings
Your gods are underachievers
With unguarded whims

So now we are drowning, drowning, drowning
We are drowning, drowning, drowning
We are drowning, drowning, drowning
We are drowning

The consequence is unfurling, unfurling, unfurling
We're falling, falling, falling
And drowning, drowning, drowning
We are drowning

I tried to reason for duty
You produced a spin
You're motivated by beauty
And the desire to win

Shadows converging breaking
Cold hand shaking
You beat me till I'm tamed
Instead of calming my fury
You just fanned the flames

So now we are drowning, drowning, drowning
We are drowning, drowning, drowning
We are drowning, drowning, drowning
We are drowning

The consequence is unfurling, unfurling, unfurling
We're falling, falling, falling
And drowning, drowning, drowning
We are drowning

So now we are drowning, drowning, drowning
We are drowning, drowning, drowning
We are drowning, drowning, drowning
We are drowning

So now we are drowning, drowning, drowning
We are drowning, drowning, drowning
We are drowning, drowning, drowning
We are drowning

The consequence is unfurling, unfurling, unfurling
We're falling, falling, falling
And drowning, drowning, drowning
We are drowning
