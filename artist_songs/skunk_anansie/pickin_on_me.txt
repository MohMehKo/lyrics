I SAW A WEIRD BOY
HE LOOKED AT ME WITH A LOOK OF PURE HATE
NOBODY KNEW ALL THE GRIEF WHERE HE`D BEEN

HE WAS A SAD BOY
HE WAS A VICTIM OF A DIRTY GOOD TIME
FEELY GAMES
IN THE BACK OF HIS BOARDED UP ESTATE

SOON ENOUGH, HE`S PICKIN` ON ME
KICKED MY HEAD IN
`COS THAT`S ALL THAT HE`D SEEN

SOON ENOUGH, HE`S PICKIN` ON ME
PICKIN` ON ME

I TOLD MY TEACHER
SHE LOOKED AT ME SO INDIFFERENTLY
HER WHOLE NIGHT 
WAS SPENT MARKING PAPER RED TAPE

SO I HAD TO LEARN TO FIGHT
KICKED HER SISTER `COS I HAD NO RESPECT
SO HERE`S THE START OF ANOTHER WAR
YOU AGAINST ME

[REPEAT CHORUS]
