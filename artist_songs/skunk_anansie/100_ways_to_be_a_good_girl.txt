I CAUSED A MAJOR WAR JUST BY TALKING
YOU FLEW INTO A RAGE, `COS THAT`S EVERYTHING YOU KNOW
CHILDHOOD OF VIOLENCE, FILLED WITH HEARTACHE
I FLEW INTO A RAGE, `COS THAT`S EVERYTHING I KNOW

I KNOW 1OO WAYS TO BE A GOOD GIRL
100 WAYS, MY WILLINGNESS TO PLEASE
I KNOW 100 WAYS TO BE A GOOD GIRL
STILL I`M ALONE, I`M ALONE, I`M ALONE, I`M ALONE [X2]

SHIELDED BY UNEXPECTED FURY
FRIGHTENED SURVIVOR IN MY WORLD TOO SHY TO SEE
SOFTLY I SPOKE SOFTLY I`M DYING
CRUSHED BY YOUR POWER, BY MY WILLINGNESS TO BLEED

I KNOW 1OO WAYS TO BE A GOOD GIRL
100 WAYS, MY WILLINGNESS TO PLEASE
I KNOW 100 WAYS TO BE A GOOD GIRL
STILL I`M ALONE, I`M ALONE, I`M ALONE, I`M ALONE [X2]

CRUCIFY MY WITH ISOLATION
CRUCIFY ME-WHOA-INSIDE MY PRIVATE HELL
