I get no rush without a view
Watching all the puppeteers
Parade in evil news
Then they say we are alright
Then they say we are alright

I get no crush without a pune
Mentally I'm sanctified
By kamikaze fools
Yeah they say we are alright
Let me say we are alright

We are the flames
You were the fire
We are the price you pay
For feeling your desires

We get no justice for our views
Sentiments per else
But really nothing ever moves
And they say we are alright
Then they say we are all

We are the flames
You were the fire
We are the price you pay
For feeling your desires

We are the flames
You were the fire
See, I'm your pretty face
Brings death to this dogfight

I get lost inside my mind
I get left behind
Behind, behind
I get left behind you

We are the flames
You were the fire
We are the price you pay
For feeling your desires

We are the flames
You are the fire
See, I'm your pretty face
Brings death to this dogfight

We are the flames
