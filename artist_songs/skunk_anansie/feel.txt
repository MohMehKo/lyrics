You think you're on your own
But that's just your desire
'Cause all you really need, baby
Is right here if you try

(But) I feel, I feel
I'm never gonna be enough for you
I feel, I feel
I'm never gonna be enough for you

You speak but there's no sound
Gonna scream these heavens down
These times feel safe and warm
Gut to push your body on

Still I feel, I feel
I'm never gonna be enough for you
I feel, I feel
I'm never gonna be enough for you

Heaven knows, in their lifetime
That I'm crying out for you
Still you believe, I'm alright
How I feel, I feel
