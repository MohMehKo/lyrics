Come along
And ride with me
So you can see
I'm just not good enough

Make a plan
This is the end
My life, my friends
Are just not good enough

I am lost ooh
I am lost
Inside my dieing light

'Cause I miss magic moments that
Should floater in the air
Yeah I feel there's a reason
Why I never take you there

I'll let you down
I'll let you down
I'll let you down
I'll let you down
Again

There are days
You shine to bright
You hurt my eyes
I just can't get enough

Special ways
Those awkward signs
With eyes that find
Is just not good enough

I'm not, ooh I am lost
Inside my dieing light

And I feel magic moments
That should sparkle in the air
Yeah I feel there is a reason
Why I can't take you there

I'll let you down
I'll let you down
I'll let you down
I'll let you down
Again

Let you down
Let you down

Come along
Cry with me
So you can see
I'm just not good enough
