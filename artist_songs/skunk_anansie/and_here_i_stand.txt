AND HERE I STAND, REDSKIN FIST OF POWER
CLAWING AT THE STRAINS OF RACISM
IT TURNS TO BLACK, `COS YOU`RE SO VERY CREDIBLE
BUT YOU KEEP LOSING TRACK

`COS YOU DON`T SEE, MY COLOUR IN YOUR MELTING POT OF LOVE
WHERE EVERY FUCKERS BROWN
SO HERE I STAND, KNEE DEEP IN YOUR SOLID HERITAGE
(THAT`S) SO CHARMINGLY UNDERGROUND

SO HERE I STAND, (STAND S-T-A-N-D) [X4]

SO HERE WE STAND, I`M LOOKING AT MY SAD,SAD EYES
THEY SLOWLY TURN AT RAGE
OH WHAT A SHAME, I CAN`T CONTAIN MY BASIC NIGGA-RAGE
AND LUST FOR VIOLENCE

SO HERE WE ARE, THE CRY GOES OUT FOR WAR
LONDON`S EAST END BURNING TO THE GROUND
SO HERE WE STAND, BLACKENED FIST OF POWER
SAME OLD SCARRED-UP-FACES WE CONDEMN
