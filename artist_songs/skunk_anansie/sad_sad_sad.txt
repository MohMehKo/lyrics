He took your breath away
But will you feel the same tomorrow
When you're down on the ropes

He takes the edge away
Same ole routine you fail and follow
You shattered your hopes
Comedy blokes

You're so
Sad sad sad
Just like his mother

You're so
Sad sad sad
Just like them others

You're sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa so
Bad bad bad
Just like your lovers

You're so
Sad sad sad
Just like your mother

You wash the stains away
You let his red hot girls corrupt you
You suckled the rats

He plays the blame charade
You filled your boobs for boys above you
He covered his tracks
You smothered the facts

You're so
Sad sad sad
Just like his mother

You're so
Sad sad sad
Just like them others

You're sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa so
Bad bad bad
Just like your lovers

You're so
Sad sad sad
Just like his mother

You play the blame charade
You play the blame charade
You play the blame charade
He took the pain away

You're sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa so
Bad bad bad
Just like your lovers

You're so
Sad sad sad
Just like your mother

You're so
Sad sad sad
Just like your mother

You're so
Sad sad sad
Just like them others

You're sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa so
Bad bad bad
Just like your lovers

You're so
Sad sad sad
Just like your mother

I feel so
