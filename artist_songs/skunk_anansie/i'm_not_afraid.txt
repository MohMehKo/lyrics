ANOTHER USELESS FIGHT
SADDENED WORDS RING TRUE
LEAVING LIKE A SAINT
STILL CLOUDS FOLLOW YOU

I'VE SEEN BEHIND YOUR WALL OF WORDS
YOU'RE SNEAKY WITH THE FACTS
LOOK WHO'S HIDING NOW
NOW I'VE SEEN THROUGH CRACKS

STILL I'M NOT AFRAID
NOT SO DEAD AFRAID
NO I'M NOT AFRAID
NOW YOU'VE ALL THE LIGHT

BEAUTY'S ALL YOU ARE
FRIENDS FOR DAYS AND ETERNAL NIGHTS
SOLID HEAD FOUR LIFE
CRAVING ALL THIS MIGHT

NOW YOU'VE ALL THE LIGHT
STILL I FEEL YOU, BY MY SIDE

NOTHING'S USELESS NOW
FRIENDS HAVE ALWAYS TIME TO TRY
THE SAFEST HANDS HOLD ME
NOW I WANDER FAR
