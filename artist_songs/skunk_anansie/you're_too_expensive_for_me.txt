I feel apprehension.
And feeling it hard.
You got me in troubles.
They're kicking my heart.
I followed the heat.
Right into your bed.
Now everyone hates me.
I might as well be dead.

Tell me how.
Tell me how to breathe.
When your arms.
Hold me too tightly
You're too expensive for me.
I'd have to break all ties for you.
Tell me how.
To fall out of love with you

Your face is illegal.
Your talk is just class.
You kiss me with vengeance.
To sweet to unmask
Still all of our issues.
Won't smother in bed.
So our little devils.
Run riot instead.
