I'VE BEEN THERE AND YOUR
FRIGID WIT WAS FAR TOO GREASY
AIN'T SO SLICK
AND IT AIN'T SO DAMN PROFOUND

I'VE BEEN THERE DONE THAT
GRILLING THAT SADLY SLEASY
AIN'T SO SCARED
OF YOUR COOL SO UNDERGROUND

AND THIS IS NOTHING 
THAT I THOUGHT I HAD  [X 3]
WITH YOU
WITH YOU
WITH YOU

YOU'VE BEEN THERE
AN' YOU RECKON IT WAS BUBBLE LOVIE
FLIRTY BABE
NOW YOUR THANG HAS RUN AGROUND

STILL BORED HERE
WATCH YOUR SLITHERING
SO VERY WAXY
BASS THUMPS CLEAR
AND YOUR BITCH WON'T
MAKE A SOUND
