Though you're lost in me
You have to see
When things ain't right
Funny memories
Won't fill this need
When things ain't right

Safe mistakes
I have made
Get burnt up inside my head
Fatal sees
But never believes
The love that it saved wants death

Friends die hard
But lovers conceive
The vibe that they hold will please
Smothered by
Sexual needs
The fade as the days go by

Some things
Don't go as you want them to
Good things
They don't always come to you
