I`LL BE YOUR SAILOR GIRL
I`LL TIP MY CAP TO YOUR PARADE 
LIFE WON`T BE DREARY NO
I`LL BE THE WAVES INSIDE YOUR BED

PAIN IS YOUR BEAUTY
IT HURTS THE VISION IN YOUR EYES
YOUR EYES ARE SMILING NOW
THEY WATCH ME CRY, THEY WATCH ME DIE 

I CAN DREAM, I CAN DREAM
I CAN DREAM THAT I`M SOMEONE ELSE
I CAN LOVE, I CAN LOVE
I CAN LOVE - WHOA - LOVE SOMEONE ELSE
MY SAVIOUR, MY DARLING

YOUR EYES SEEP THROUGH ME
YOU THINK YOU HATE THE WAY I MINCE
I`M SCREWING YOUR DREAMS NOW
SO CYNICAL AT YOUR EXPENSE

OH WHAT A SACRIFICE
ALL OF MY PAIN WON`T FADE AWAY
SO WHO`S SO SPECIAL NOW
NO ONE`S MORE SPECIAL, MORE THAN ME
