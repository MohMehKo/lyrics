LOST INFIDELITY,
WE NEVER SAID A WORD
SO BLACK AND WHITE YOU SEE
IT`S ALL THE LIES WE`VE HEARD

IN MY MIND NOTHING MAKES SENSE
I`M NOTHING YOU CAN`T HAVE
CRACKED UP TO DISAGREE, 
THAT`S ALL WE`VE EVER HAD

YOU, ONLY YOU, ONLY YOU
ONLY YOU CAN`T BE THE ONE [X2]

YOUR SECRET SMILE SO QUAINT
IN MEMORIES FORTOLD
LAUGHING SO VICIOUSLY
YOUR CONCIENCE HAS BEEN SOLD

IN MY FACE THERE`S NO MORE JOY
I`M ALL THAT I SHOULD BE,BE,BE
CRACKED INFIDELITY,
IS ALL YOU ARE TOO ME

YOU, ONLY YOU, ONLY YOU
ONLY YOU CAN`T BE THE ONE
ONLY YOU, ONLY YOU
ONLY YOU CAN`T BE THE ONE
BE THE ONE, BE THE ONE, BE THE ONE 

WE DON`T TALK ANYMORE
WE DON`T TALK ANYMORE
WE DON`T CARE ANYMORE
WE DON`T CARE ANYMORE

ONLY YOU CAN`T BE THE ONE
