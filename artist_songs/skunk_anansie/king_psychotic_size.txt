I want you to be the way I grieve tonight
I'd drained out my face too tired of being right
So this is the view it's too weeping such love in this dream
This is your truth it will choke your lover down 

If you keep deceiving
If you keep on crushing me
If you keep believing
Then I'll be feeding off you
'Till these eyes are blue
Queen psychotic fool 

So now I can smell the barely blooded size
No sonic relief from blood aromic try
So this is your name your still secreting the blood of in greed
All of your name suffocate in your lust for me 

If you keep deceiving
If you keep on crushing me
If you keep believing
Then I'll be feeding off you
'Till these eyes are blue
Queen psychotic fool 

If you keep deceiving
If you keep on pushing me
If you keep believing
Then I'll be feeding off you
'Till these eyes are blue
Queen psychotic fool
