I've seen no fear
Your purpose is clear
Inside, in deep
I quicken, my breathes, be

Before you implode my darling
Before you expose you're here
I see your disgrace, on right chance
But you're fragile, you get broken
You're still fragile
And you shadow when you fall

You live, you learn
Yours scratches, they burn
Superficial, but deep
I stand for, my freshes, be

Before you implode my darling
Before you expose you're here
I see your disgrace, on right chance
But you're fragile, you get broken
You're still fragile
And you shadow when u fall
