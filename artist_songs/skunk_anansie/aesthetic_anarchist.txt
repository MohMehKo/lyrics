Unconventionally a believer
In the power of your fellow kind
But when your pockets fill to overflowing
You can use it better than they can

There's something that you do believe in
There's nothing anyone should need
And your philosophy is ever changing
It's the backbone of your greed

Aesthetic anarchist
Your people await
Aesthetic anarchist
You can't be late
So park your conscience where your ego lies
Aesthetic anarchist
With your gold tooth smile
Ana hey, Ana ho, Ana hey, Ana ho (Anarchist)

You tell them what they want to hear now
Using language from the street
Appealing to the lowest emotion
Making promises you won`t keep
Ana hey, Ana ho, Ana hey, Ana ho (Anarchist)
