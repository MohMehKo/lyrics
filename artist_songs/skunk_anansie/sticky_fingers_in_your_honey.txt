They might say
Come inside
The devils and their monkeys
They want to fight

Try to make you feel good
Nice and cool
Waiting for forgiveness
Nothing new, nothing new, nothing new

All they want is your money
Sticky fingers in your honey
All they want is your money
Sticky fingers in your honey

Occupy
Southern lies
Power to the people
With old school ties

Nothing's gonna change
Till you smash it up
Televise the vision
Never learn
You never learn
You never learn

All they want is your money
Sticky fingers in your honey
All they want is your money
Sticky fingers in your honey

All they want is your money
Sticky fingers in your honey
All they want is your money
Sticky fingers in your honey...
