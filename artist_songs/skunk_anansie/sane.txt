Crack the head against the wall
It's a never over 'til you've killed the manic expression one for all
Stand too tall
Terror skinned him to the bone
He saw the liberia and liked to say I'd make it on my own
My way home
You keep me sane
You keep me sane
Save enough or suffer you
Strong enough to see it through
I wonder you
Scratch the eyes enough to see
All the misery has been around as I pretend to be
Starve free
