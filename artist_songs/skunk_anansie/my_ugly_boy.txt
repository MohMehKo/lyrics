The cheaper the face I love it
Warn but beautiful
And wherever he likes to go
The dirtiest girls will show

The city the ways I love is
Rough and beautiful
Cause wherever he likes to go
The freakiest boys will blow

Blow away
My ugly boy
My sweetest toy
My ugly boy, boy, boy

The cheaper the bitch I roll it
Hot but fruitful
And a thick of a slitch I roll
The faster he will fall, fall for me

My ugly boy
My sweetest toy
My ugly boy, boy, boy

My ugly boy
My sweetest joy
My ugly boy, boy, boy

And I know what I'd like to do
Take him down and make him crawl
Yeah I know how I'd like to roll
My, my ugly boy

My ugly boy
My sweetest joy
My ugly boy

My ugly boy
My sweetest toy
My ugly boy, boy, boy

My ugly boy
My sweetest joy
My ugly boy, boy, boy
