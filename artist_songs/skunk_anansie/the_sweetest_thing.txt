You have the floor but once upon a time you had more
You shake, you shout, but somewhere you got smothered in doubt...come on
Don't burst them seams there's nothing wrong with living the dream
'cos you just have to know...
THE SWEETEST THING IS YOU BABY,
THE SWEETEST THING THAT I CAN BREATHE...IT'S YOU BABY
I bless your love but this ain't sifting down from above
I kiss your face, my sanity will manage your ways
I'm strong, I'm free, my confidence is burning the fear
'cos you just have to know...
THE SWEETEST THING IS YOU BABY,
THE SWEETEST THING THAT I CAN BREATHE...IT'S YOU BABY
Survive the grind or ego queens will sharpen their heels,
Be true, stay calm, in this old town you've nothing to lose...
'cos you just have to know...
THE SWEETEST THING IS YOU BABY,
THE SWEETEST THING THAT I CAN BREATHE...IT'S YOU BABY
