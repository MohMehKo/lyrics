I’d like to invite you
To this pretty little thing
Where the fruits of your labors
Are eaten by the queen
Yeah I’d like to bequest you
A seat with greedy boys
But I’m sorry,
I’ma stop you, at the door

I believed in you
Well, I was wrong
I believed you’d make me better
I was wrong
I believed you’d shine your light and save my world
Like Superman or God
I believed in you
Well, I was wrong

Will you do me the favor?
Go slit your skinny throat
Let your blood flow freely
So all your boys can choke
As I rise to defeat you
On revolution role
Where your rules and your failures
Will show

I believed in you
Well, I was wrong
I believed you’d make me better
I was wrong
I believed you’d shine your light and save my soul
Like Superman or God
I believed in you
Well, I was wrong

Oh I hope, when you’re sleeping
Your guns are close at hand
Who knows who’s cheating
To steal your contraband
That you gained in abundance
From cattle living poor
One day the would take it, no more

I believed in you
Well, I was wrong
I believed you’d make me better
I was wrong
I believed you’d shine your light and save my soul
Like Lucifer or God
I believed in you
Well, I was wrong

I believed in you
Well, I was wrong
I believed you’d make me better
I was wrong
I believed you’d shine your light and save my soul
Like Superman or God
I believed in you
Well, I was wrong
