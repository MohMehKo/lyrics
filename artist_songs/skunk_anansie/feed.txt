You see these eyes, they`re darn to hurt
I want to crush you, what you gave birth
I want the power without the grace
I want to have you for your sweet taste

I`m big brother, I`m watching you [X2]
I have your face inside my eyes
I`m big brother, I`m watching you

I can`t resist to fuck you up
You`re named and numbered,
I`ve got the lot
You`re on your face, you`re in their dirt
I`m burning through what you convert

I`m big brother, I`m watching you
I`m big brother I`m watching you
I have your face inside my eyes
I`m big brother, I`m watching you

Feed of the world [X4]

... You are the last man alive

I want the power, I want control
I want your life, want you to know
Theres nothing you can think to do
`Cos I`m Big Brother and I`m watching you

I`m big brother, I`m watching you [X2]
I have your face inside my eyes
I`m big brother, I`m watching you [X3]
I have your face inside my eyes
I`m big brother, I`m watching you
Big brother
