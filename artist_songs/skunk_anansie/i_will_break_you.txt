I can be anything, be anything for you
No need to whistle 'cause I carry all the tools
I can be anyone, be anyone for you
I've all the weapons and I follow no one's rules

I let it go
Let it go
Let it go

Don't try to humble me I'm badass to the bone
I've been where you ain't seen so shut up with that tone
Don't try to mess with me I'll train you like a hound
I'll fill up all your bees till honey licks the ground

Yeah I will break you, with my fire
I'll destroy you, with my desire
Yeah I will break you, with my fire
I'll destroy you, with my desire

Those sluts have nothing on me, I control the zone,
I'll pick the bones of you, fuck up your little world
I will inspire you to blow out of your head
Shock up and fire you'll rock you till your dead

I let it show
Let it show
Yeah I will break you, with ma fire
I'll destroy you, with my desire
Yeah I will break you, with ma fire
I'll destroy you, with my desire

Yeah I will break you, with ma fire
I'll destroy you, with my desire
Yeah I will break you, with ma fire
I'll destroy you, with my desire
