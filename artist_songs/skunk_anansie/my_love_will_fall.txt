Retain.
Distrust.
Resign.
Your lust.
Your call.
These cuts.
Run through.
My guts.
My love, I feel the fall, again.
My love, I feel the pull.
March on.
Freak out.
Release.
Your doubts.
Resist.
Reborn.
I can't.
Move on.
My love, I feel the fall, again.
My love, I feel the pull.

You cannot win.
I curse my love for you.
I curse my love for you.
I curse my love for you.
I curse my love.

I crave.
Your words.
That spill.
And hurt.
My bones.
My soul.
I'll burn.
Them all.

Begin.
Again.
Revive.
The dead.
All quiet.
All calm.
Your gain.
Has gone.
My love, I feel the fall, again.
My love, I feel the pull.
