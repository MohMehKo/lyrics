"Blackie" in the closet. "Whitie" in the crowd.
Bugeyed, cause your later in the mirror,
and you know you`re gonna ?? from your doglife.

Fixing up the motor
So you can smash`em in, in their beds.
So you have all your never-ending glories, 
But we know you gotta stick along with the hard types.
But who`s gonna know you when it`s over ?
And who`s gonna know you when it`s over, it`s over.
Who`s gonna show you,
If you just know that they don`t want you
When it`s over, when the dogfight is over.

Givin` you the shotlight, 
But we know you are one of a blind.
Spooky, how you always stick to brown-ones, 
But they know you have it on your own
When it`s over, it`s over.
But who`s gonna know you when it`s over ?
And who`s gonna know you when it`s over, it`s over.
And who`s gonna show you,
That you should know that they don`t want you,
When it`s over, when the dogfight is over.

But who`s gonna know you when it`s over?
Who`s gonna know you when it`s over?
And who`s gonna show you
That you should know that they don`t want you
When it`s over, when the dogfight is over.

But who`s gonna know you when it`s over?
Who`s gonna know you when it`s over, it`s over.
And who`s gonna show you
That you should know that they don`t want you
When it`s over, when the dogfight is over.

I never tell you what you want
I never tell you what you want
I gotta tell you what you wanna love
I never wanted, what your lover want is gold.
