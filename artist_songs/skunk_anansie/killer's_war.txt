I'm watching you insense me
With your effervescent hate
You can kill without obsession
With your morals from the state

Incredible, conceivable
You justify yourself
But the demons in your partisan
Creep up inside your wealth

This is war, killers' war
This is war, killers' war

And all your little devils
Watch the saints come marching in
'Cos they have no expectations
From the smell of your fake sins

Your eyes go blind from whiteness
There's no mystery to unturn
Your cracked inside your coloured shell
'Cos you will never learn

This is war, Killers` war
This is war, Killers` war
War

You want me to fuck you,
I can`t even fuck myself
You want me to fuck you,
I can`t even fuck myself

War, War, War,
You want me to fuck you,
I can`t even fuck myself
You want me to fuck you,
I can`t even fuck

This is war, killers' war
