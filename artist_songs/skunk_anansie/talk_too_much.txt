Maybe I should be more discrete
serve you up some sugary sweet
I could be the wildest of childs
that's not a real feat
Blessings come but favors they go
troubled by the whispers they know
I could sink but I'm not the type
I don't need to hide
YOU WANT ME NOW
BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
COS I WANT YOU FOR A LIFETIME
YOU SAY IT LOUD BUT YOU TALK TOO MUCH
I STILL WANT YOU FOR A LIFETIME TODAY
I can leave but I stay to pray
maybe on my knees you'll fail
no one moved so no one got hurt
this could be the day that you'll learn...today.
