[Naomi Scott]
I can't pretend
To know how you feel
But know that I'm here
Know that I'm real

[Adam Hicks]
Say what you want
Or don't talk at all

[Naomi Scott]
I'm not gonna let you fall

Reach for my hand
'Cause it's held out for you
My shoulders are small
But you can cry on them too

Everything changes
But one thing is true
Understand
We'll always be more than a band

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Hayley Kiyoko]
You used to brave the world
All on your own
Now we won't let you go, go it alone

[Blake Michael]
Be who you wanna be
Always stand tall

[All]
Not gonna let you fall

Reach for my hand
'Cause it's held out for you
My shoulders are strong
But you can cry on them too

Everything changes
But one thing is true
Understand
We'll always be more than a band

[Bridgit Mendler]
I never knew you could take me so far
I've always wanted to hope that you are the ones I need

[All]
Reach for my hand
'Cause it's held out for you
My shoulders are strong
But you can cry on them too (cry on them too)

Everything changes
But one thing is true
Understand
We'll always be more than a band

[Bridgit Mendler]
Reach for my hand
'Cause it's held out for you
My shoulders are strong
But you can cry on them too

Everything changes
But one thing is true
Understand
We'll always be more than a band
