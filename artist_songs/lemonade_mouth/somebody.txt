Can you see me?
'Cause I'm right here
Can you listen?
'Cause I've been trying to make you notice
What it would mean to me
To feel like somebody
We've been on our way to nowhere
Tryin' so hard to get there

[Chorus:]
And I say
Oh!
We're gonna let it show!
We're gonna just let go of everything
Holding back our dreams
And try
To make it come alive
C'mon let it shine so they can see
We were meant to be
Somebody (Somebody)
Somebody, yeah (Somebody)
Somehow
Someday
Someway
Somebody

I'm so tired
Of being invisible
But I feel it, yeah
Like a fire below the surface
Trying to set me free
Burnin' inside of me
'Cause were standing on the edge now
It's a long way down

[Chorus:]
But I say
Oh!
We're gonna let it show!
We're gonna just let go of everything
Holding back our dreams
And try
To make it come alive
C'mon let it shine so they can see
We were meant to be
Somebody (Somebody)
Somebody, yeah (Somebody)
Somehow
Someday
Someway
Somebody

We will walk out of this darkness
Feel the spotlight glowing like a yellow sun
Ohohohohoh (Ohohohohoh)
And when we fall we fall together
'Til we get back up and we will rise as one
Ohohohohoh

[Chorus:]
Oh!
We're gonna let it show!
We're gonna just let go of everything
Holding back our dreams
And try
To make it come alive
C'mon let it shine so they can see
We were meant to be
Somebody (Somebody)
Somebody, yeah (Somebody)
Somehow
Someday
Someway
Somebody
Somebody
Ooo Oh
