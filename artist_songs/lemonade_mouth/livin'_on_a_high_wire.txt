This is the story on how we lived
The glory of what we did
It started when we were kids
With music up in our heads
She said

I've been out on the edge
Breathin' a little bit of fresh air
Big dreams, I took a chance
Held out for everything I've got here

I've been feeling this life's a circus
Hanging on without a fear

Livin' on a high wire
Runnin' through a wildfire
You can't shake me, I'm not going nowhere
Walking on a tight rope
No net, high hopes
Step back, I'm gonna make it over

Na na na-na-na na na
Livin' on a high wire
Na na na-na-na na na
Livin' on a high wire

This is the story on how we lived
The glory of what we did
It started when we were kids
With music up in our heads
She said

Big top, turning around, no clowns
I'm running as I hit the ground
Front row, big show is sold out
So I'm ready for the crowd roar, let's go

I've been feeling this life's a circus
Hanging on without a fear

Livin' on a high wire
Runnin' through a wildfire
You can't shake me, I'm not going nowhere
Walking on a tight rope
No net, high hopes
Step back, I'm gonna make it over

Na na na-na-na na na
Livin' on a high wire
Na na na-na-na na na
Livin' on a high wire

When it comes to the beat
Seeing that the heads are moving
Move off your seat
Achievement is what we're really doing
Freedom of speech
I'm in it just to win it
I'm springin' and I can see it
In the end that you can be it
'Cause it's patience, it's statements
Famous greatness
Movin' 'til you make it through
And maybe you can make it too

Livin' on a high wire
You can't shake me, I'm not going nowhere
Walking on a tight rope
No net, high hopes
Step back, I'm gonna make it over

Na na na-na-na na na
Livin' on a high wire
Na na na-na-na na na
Livin' on a high wire
On top, baby
We're looking down now
Livin' on a high wire
