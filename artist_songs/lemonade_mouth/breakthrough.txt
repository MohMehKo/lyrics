Oooh yeah, mmmm
Breakthrough

Up, down, spinnin' all around
Fly high, falling to the ground
Sometimes dreams can feel so far away

Time keeps skippin' out a beat
Left, right, trippin' on your feet
Life is like a string of cloudy days

Sometimes it's raisin' your voice
Sometimes it's makin' some noise
Sometimes it's proving to the world it was wrong
Whenever you can't see the light
Whenever there's no end in sight
Keep on, keep on moving on
Keep on moving on

Here comes a breakthrough
Here comes a day
Here comes a moment that you gotta go for it
So don't let it get away
It's all a breakthrough
Just turn the page
Cause everyday I'm getting closer
Life is just a rollercoaster

Shake it, till you make it
Till you breaking on through
Don't stop till you breaking on through
Shake it, till you make it
Till you breaking on through
Don't stop till you breaking on through

Stop, still, take another breath
Road block, move it to the left
Get around whatever's in your way

Heartbreak, pick up all the pieces
Don't stop dancin’ in the bleachers
It's gonna be your turn to play
Gonna be your turn to play

Sometimes it's raisin' your voice
Sometimes it's makin' some noise
Sometimes it's provin’ to the world it was wrong
Whenever you can't see the light
Whenever there's no end in sight
Keep on, keep on movin' on
Keep on movin' on

Groovin’ to the music imma use it when the time's right
Hoping I can do it through the shadows, I can shine bright
