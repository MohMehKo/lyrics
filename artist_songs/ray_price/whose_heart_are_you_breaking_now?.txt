I was the one that you fooled yesterday
Whose heart are you breaking now?
You took a romance and threw it away
Whose heart are you breaking now?

What has become of the love I once knew?
What have you done with each vow?
Somebody else now is game for a day
Whose heart are you breaking now?

I was the one that you left all alone
Whose heart are you breaking now?
You were the one with a heart made of stone
Whose heart are you breaking now?

I used to think you would always be me
Every thing's different somehow
You're smiling now but some day you will pay
Whose heart are you breaking now?
