Tonight I'm going out and burn some bridges but only on the road that leads to you
Find a bar and drown a million memories what else is there left for me to do
This time I won't give in and let you put me through
Another day for you to play with a heart that worships you
Cause tonight I'm going out and burn some bridges
But only on the road that leads to you

Cause tonight I'm going out and burn some bridges across crazy river of regret
Find someone who thinks a little of me and maybe somehow then I can forget
This time I won't give in...
