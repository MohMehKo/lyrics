Go away can't you see I'm crying
Go back to the new love you have found
Don't sweet talk me cause I'm not listening
And you'll only make things worse by hanging round.

I know that I'd be crazy if I took you back again
But this foolish heart of mine might just repent and give in
So go away I feel much safer when you're gone
Cause you're the one who made me cry now let my cry alone.

I know that I'd be crazy if I took you back again
But this foolish heart of mine might just repent and give in
So go away I feel much safer when you're gone
Cause you're the one who made me cry now let my cry alone...
