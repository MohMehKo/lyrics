Welcome to my world
Won't you come on in
Miracles I guess

Still happen now and then
Step into my heart
Leave your cares behind
Welcome to my world

Built with you in mind
Knock and the door will open
Seek and you will find
Ask and you'll be givin'

The key to this world of mine
I'll be waiting here
With my arms uncurled
Waiting just for you
Welcome to my world
