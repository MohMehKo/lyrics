This old smoke filled bar is something I'm not used to
But I gave up my home to see you satisfied
And I just called to let you know where I'm livin'
It's not much but I feel welcome here inside
I've got swinging doors a jukebox and a bar stool
And my new home has a flashing neon sign
Stop by and see me anytime you want to
Cause I'm always here at home till closing time

I've got everything I need to drive me crazy
And I've got everything it takes to lose my mind
And in here the atmosphere's just right for heartaches
And thanks to you I'm always here till closing time
I've got swinging doors
