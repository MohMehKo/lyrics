If all our love is through, if you found someone new
I want to hear it from you
If there is no mistake and if my heart must break
I want to hear it from you

Just the thought of losing you is more that I can stand
But this heart would be much worse if I heard it second hand
If there's no hope at all, if all my world must fall
I want to hear it from you

So tell me now if things are not the way they used to be
I want to hear it from your lips, you owe this much to me
If all our love is through, if you found someone new
I want to hear it from you
