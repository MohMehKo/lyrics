There's no fool like a young fool with wild and careless way
Who forgets about tomorrow and lives for just today
If she could only realize the sorrow that's in store
She'd try behavin' on for sights and honky tonk no more.

It breaks my heart to see her sitting there
With tavern lights shining in her hair
Life won't be as sweet to her tomorrow as today
There's no fool like a young fool who throws her life away.

Now the dim lights and the drinking seem like fun I know
But she'll find out one morning you reap just what you sowed
The sad part is she'll be alone once she starts to fall
There's no fool like a young fool who thinks she knows it all.

It breaks my heart to see her sitting there
With tavern lights shining in her hair
Life won't be as sweet to her tomorrow as today
There's no fool like a young fool who throws her life away...
