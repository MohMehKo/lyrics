The kind of love I can't forget dear
Was the love you gave to me
I had my chance and now I suffer
My heart is filled with misery.

Your heart was kind and oh, so failthful
It should have never known distress
And then my sorrow I am weeping
Though you don't care I must confess.

So why not take me back again
Dear, we could live so happilly
The kind of love I can't forget, dear
Was the love you gave to me...
