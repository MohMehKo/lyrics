Just because you lost your heart did you lose your conscience too
Why must you punish me for what he's done to you
Hatred caused by injured pride made you lie and deceive
You can't get back again so you take it out on me
And eye for an eye a heart for a heart
You're making me pay for another man's crime
And eye for an eye a heart for a heart
You didn't have one so you took mine

It was just a game with you with no feeling or regret
You thought by hurting me it would help you to forget
Will I be like you are now will I do the things you've done
Will another have to lose before I can say I won
And eye for an eye...
