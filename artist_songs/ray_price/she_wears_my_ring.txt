She wears my, my ring to show the world
That she belongs to me
She wears my ring to show the world
She's mine eternally

With loving care I place it on her finger
To show my love for all the world to see
This tiny ring is a thing of a tender remotion
An endless fool of love that's as deep as the ocean

She swears to wear it with eternal devotion
That's why I sing because she wears my ring
This tiny ring
