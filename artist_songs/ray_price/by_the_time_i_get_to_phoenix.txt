By the time I get to Phoenix she'll be rising
She'll find the note I left hanging on her door
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leaving
'Cause I've left that girl so many times before

By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be working
She'll prob'ly stop at lunch and give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringing off the wall that's all
By the time I make Oklahoma she'll be sleeping

She'll turn softly and call my name out low
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her
Though time and time I've tried to tell her
So she just didn't know I would really go
