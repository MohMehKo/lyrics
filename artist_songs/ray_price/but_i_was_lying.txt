I said congratulations and I hope you're happy
But I was lying I hope you're crying
And everytime she touches you you'll think of me
I said the best of luck to you to your new love
But I was lying no use denying
I'm not as good a loser as I thought I'd be
I hope our past is strong enough to cloud your vision
Till one day she'll even get to look like me
I hope my mem'ry crowd your mind within decision
And from force of habit you'll run straight to me
And when I said I'll see you soon let's together
I wasn't lying I hope you're crying
Tears of joy the day that you come back to me
