When shadows fall I'm twice as lonely how I miss my one and only
Gone the night like many nights before
Ever since the day I found her all my world's been built around her
Just like before she's hurt me once more
And I'm walking the floor

Walking slow and thinking bout her how long can I live without her
Teardrops dim these eyes that watch the door
Though I've got this heartsick feeling still I hope that she'll come stealing
Back through the door like always before
I'll forgive her once more and stop walking the floor

Walking slow and thinking bout her...
