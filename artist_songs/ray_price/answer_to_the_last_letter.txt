I just received your last letter and I feel so blue
I'm paying dearly for promises broken so free
I never dreamed that there'd be such a longing for you
But I'm been no angel so I've got what's coming to me
I am so weary and tired of another's caress
Though I would love to be with you I know it's too late
But I still love you and that is one thing I'll confess
I know I deserve to be punished whatever my fate

I'd give all these diamonds if I could be happy again
And have you hold me and tell me that we'd never part
Diamonds can never replace a true sweetheart or friend
All of this glamor can't banish the ache in my heart
All I have left is a dream of the days that are gone
All I have left is a mem'ry that never will fade
If you must leave me to suffer life's heartaches alone
I ask your forgiveness for all the mistakes I have made
