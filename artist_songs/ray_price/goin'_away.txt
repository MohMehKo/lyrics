I'm goin' away without you babe I'm goin' away all by myself
I'm gonna find the one who lives inside of me
And when I do I send for you to live with me

I don't know where I'm gonna go I just need time to be alone
I know that I'm gonna miss your company
But I need time to clear my mind then be with me

I'm goin' away without you babe...
And when I do I send for you to live with me
