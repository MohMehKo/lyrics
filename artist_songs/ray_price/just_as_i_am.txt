(Just as I am just as I am)
Just as I am without one plea but that Thy blood was shed for me
And that Thou bid'st me come to Thee oh lamb of God I come I come (I come)
Just as I am and waiting not to rid my soul of one dark blot
To Thee who's blood can cleanse each spot oh lamb of God I come I come (I come)

Because Thy promise I believe oh lamb of God I come I come (I come)
