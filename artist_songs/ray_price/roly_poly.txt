Roly Poly eatin' corn and taters
Hungry every minute of the day
Roly Poly knowin' all the biscuits
As long as he can chew it, it's okay

He can eat an apple pie and never even bat an eye
He likes everything from a soup to hay
Oh Roly Poly, daddy's little fatty
Daddy's gonna be a man someday

Roly Poly scrambled eggs for breakfast
Bread and jelly twenty times a day
Roly Poly eats a hard day dinner
It takes a lot of strength to run and play

He bowls up weeds and does the chores
And run both ways to Holday's stores
He wears up that appetite that way
Hey Roly Poly, daddy's little fatty
Daddy's gonna be a man someday
