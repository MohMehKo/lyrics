Oh make the world go away and get it off my shoulder
It goes bigger day by day please make the world go away
I was wrong the day I left you and let the world leave me astray
If you'll say that you forgive me you'll make the world go away
Oh make the world go away and get it off my shoulder
I go weaker day by day please make the world go away
I'm sorry that I hurt you I'll make it up day by day
Can you love me like you used to and make the world go away
Make the world go away and get it off my shoulder
Can you love me like you used to and make the world go away
Say the things you used to say and make the world go away
I can't stand another day please make the world go away
Say you'll take me back to stay and make the world go away
