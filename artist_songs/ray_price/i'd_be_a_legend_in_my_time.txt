If heartaches brought fame in love's crazy game
I'd be a legend in my time
If they gave gold statuetts for tears and regrets
I'd be a legend in my time.

But they don't give awards
And there's no praise or fame
For a heart that's been broken
Over love that's in vain.

If loneliness meant world acclaim
Everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my time.

But they don't give awards
And there's no praise or fame
For a heart that's been broken
Over love that's in vain.

If loneliness meant world acclaim
Everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my time...
