If I don't act myself when I'm around you and I bring up the things you used to say
Well I just haven't learned to forget like you do but it's only love it'll go away
And if I call at night while you're still sleeping just to talk to you about yesterday
Then before I hang up I start to weeping well it's only love it'll go away
It's only love it'll go away at least that's what you say
Yours did and mine will I hope some day cause it's only love it'll go away
It's only love it'll go away
