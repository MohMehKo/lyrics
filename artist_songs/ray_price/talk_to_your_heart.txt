When your alone at night with the world locked outside
Have a talk to your heart about me
If your's told that it's right that we stay apart
Then let me come in and talk to your heart

Lovin' you changed my life in just one day
I'm waiting to hear what your heart will say
If your told that it's right that we stay apart
Then let me come in and talk to your heart

Believe you me there will be happiness when
You open your door and let me come in
If your told that it's right that we stay apart
Then let me come in and talk to your heart

So talk to your heart if it can't decide
Remember my own is waiting outside
Waiting alone outside in the dark
So let me come in and talk to your heart
