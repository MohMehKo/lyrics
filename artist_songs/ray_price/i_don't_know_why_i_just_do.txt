I don't know why, I love you like I do
I don't know why, but I do
I don't know why, you thrill me like you do
I don't know why you just do

You never seem to want my romancin'
The only time you hold me is when we're dancin'

I don't know why, I love you like I do
I don't know why, I just do
I don't know why, I love you like I do
I don't know why, you thrill me like you do

You never seem to want my romancin'
The only time you hold me is when we're dancin'

I don't know why I love you like I do
I don't know why, but I do
I don't know why, but I do
