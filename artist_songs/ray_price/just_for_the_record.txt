I know our love is over you've made it plain to see
But just for the record did you ever love me
I hope that you'll be happy I'm gonna try to be
But just for the record did you ever love me
Or was I just fillin' in while you waited for love to come by
Or did you once love me if you did why oh why did it die
This is the last time I'll call you from this moment on you're free
But just for the record did you ever love me
Just for the record did you ever love me
