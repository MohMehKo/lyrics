I'm drinking champagne feelin' no pain till early morning
Dinin' and dancin' with every pretty girl I can find
Having a fling with a pretty young thing till early morning
Knowin' tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind

Guilty conscience  I guess though I must confess
I never loved you much when you were mine

So I'll keep drinking champagne feelin' no pain till early morning
Dinin' and dancin' with every pretty girl I can find
Havin' a fling with a pretty young thing till early morning
Knowin' tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind

Guilty conscience  I guess though I must confess
I never loved you much when you were mine

So I'll keep drinking champagne feelin' no pain till early morning
Dinin' and dancin' with every pretty girl I can find
Havin' a fling with a pretty young thing till early morning
Knowin' tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind
