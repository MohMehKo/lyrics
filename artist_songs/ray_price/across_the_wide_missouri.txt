My true love stands across the river far across the rolling river
On the banks I hear her calling
Away we're bound away across the wide Missouri
Oh Shennandoah I long to see you far across the rolling river
Shennandoah I'll not deceive you
Away we're bound away across the wide Missouri

For seven years I've been a rover far across the rolling river
I'll return and be your lover
Away we're bound away across the wide Missouri
