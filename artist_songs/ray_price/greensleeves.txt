I walked one day neath the summer sky and my heart was young and alone was I
She came along and I fancied heard the beatiful music of greensleeves
She held my hand happiness complete and we kissed that night as we vowed to meet
The promisses that she made we sweet just as sweet as the music of greensleeves
I walked one day neath the winter sky and my heart was sad and alone was I
Can't believe that we said goodbye and I cried to the music of greensleeves
Gone gone is the love we knew and the beatiful music of greensleeves
