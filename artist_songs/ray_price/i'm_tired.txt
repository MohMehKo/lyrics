Well, I'm standin' on the corner of a busy street
A lookin' for your face in ever crowd I meet
Searchin' every honky tonk in this town
Tryin' to find the places where you hang around

Oh Lord, I'm tired, tired of living this a way

Well, I've been waitin' on you, baby, night and day
A wonderin' if your love will ever come my way
But time's runnin' out and I'm a slowin' down
I'm tired of bein' just another hang around

Oh Lord, I'm tired, tired of living this a way

There ain't no happiness in anything I do
I found myself so lonely when I'm not with you
What makes you just a kinda girl, a guy will love
You've got so many others that you're thinking of

Oh Lord, I'm tired, tired of living this a way
Oh Lord, I'm tired, tired of living this a way
