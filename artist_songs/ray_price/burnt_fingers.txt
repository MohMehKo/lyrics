When a man plays with fire he gets burnt fingers
When he's a playin' with desire he gets burnt fingers
When a man starts to trifel and leaves his true love all alone
He'll break her heart and break his own
When a man finds a bad girl he think it's fun
But when he comes back to his little girl the harm is done
When a man gets burnt fingers he gets the deepest kind of blues
When a man plays with fire he's bound to lose

When a man finds a bad girl...
