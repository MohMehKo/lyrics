So your new love let your feelings sad and blue
And it broke your heart in two to see him go
Now you know the lonely nights that I've gone through
And I'm glad that I can say I told you so
When you cry yourself to sleep remember me
Think of all the things I told you long ago
You know how it feels to be the used to be 
and I'm glad that I can say I told you so

So your someone broke your heart you realize
That the time has come to reap just what you sowed
For somebody else told you the same old lie 
and I'm glad that I can say I told you so
When you see me with the smile upon my face
And the sadness of an achin' heart you know
I'll be happy with another in your place 
and I'm glad that I can say I told you so

When you miss the happiness you'll never find
Think of me each time the bitter teardrops flow
But you have no mercy on this heart of mine 
and I'm glad that I can say I told you so
