The day you left me I left town that night
I thought I could forget that you're out of sight
But you're still a part of me and so I see
That miles can't change a thing for me.

I ran away from friends that we once knew
I tried to run from thoughts of losing you
I ran away from everybody else
But I can't run away from myself.

It makes no difference just how far I'd go
Your memory will always haunt me so
I realize the truth now since I left
That I can't run away from myself.

I ran away from friends that we once knew
I tried to run from thoughts of losing you
I ran away from everybody else
But I can't run away from myself...
