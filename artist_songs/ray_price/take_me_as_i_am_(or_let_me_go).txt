Why must you always try to make me over
take me as I am or let me go
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover
take me as I am or let me go
You're trying to reshape me
like your old love
In the image of the one
you used to know
But I won't be a stand in for an old love
take me as I am or let me go
You're trying to reshape me
like your old love
In the image of the one
you used to know
But I won't be a stand in for an old love
take me as I am or let me go
