There was a time that I thought of no other
And we sang our own love's refrain
Our hearts beat as one as we had our fun
But time changes everything.

When you left me my poor heart was broken
Our romance seemed all in vain
The dark clouds're gone and there's blue skies again
The time changes everything.

You can change the name of an old song
Rearrange it and make it swing
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you
But time changes everything.

So goodluck to you, may God bless you
I can't say I won't love again
You've gone your way and now I'll go mine
'Cause time has changed everything...
