If you are sincere when you say you don't care
At least you just let the past be
If the love that we knew don't bother you
Darling, you're stronger than me

For if still loving you means I'm weak
I guess I'm weak
For I still fall apart when you speak
Or when we meet.

If the love that we knew don't bother you
Darling, you're stronger than me.

If you can't help falling with some other one
With no thoughts of what used to be
If it's easy to say that it's better this way
Darling, you're stronger than me.

For if still loving you means I'm weak
I guess I'm weak
For I still fall apart when you speak
Or when we meet.

If the love that we knew don't bother you
Darling, you're stronger than me...
