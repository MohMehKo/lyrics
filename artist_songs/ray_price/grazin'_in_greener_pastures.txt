Anytime the love's waters grow cold and deep
A grass gets short and then begins to fade
I just go and search of greener fields with taller grass to reap
And shallow water where the man can wade

And you'll find me grazin' in greener pastures
livin' on love and laughter
haven't got a care to cloud my mind
I'm grazin' in greener pastures
livin' on love and laughter
And the grass is gettin' greener all the time

My fields have no boundaries fences or gates
And the pleasures that grow there grow wild and free
You can graze but don't forget I like my pastures green
And when the weeds began to grow I always leave
And you'll find me grazin' in greener pastures livin' on love and laughter
Haven't got a care to cloud my mind

And you'll find me grazin' in greener pastures
livin' on love and laughter
haven't got a care to cloud my mind
I'm grazin' in greener pastures
livin' on love and laughter
And the grass is gettin' greener all the time

Now and then my mind goes back to other grass
And the many fields that I have left behind
And I like to think that where I've been I can always go again
And find the gate open to me anytime

you'll find me grazin' in greener pastures
livin' on love and laughter
haven't got a care to cloud my mind
I'm grazin' in greener pastures
livin' on love and laughter
And the grass is gettin' greener all the time
And the grass is gettin' greener all the time
