Does your conscience ever bother you
When somebody calls my name
Tries to think of all that I've gone through
And hang your head in shame

Someone came along and took my place
Then you gave me all the blame
You should go somewhere and hide your face
And hang your head in shame

When you said I was the only one
Was it just your little game
Now look back at all the harm you've done
And hang your head in shame

I should hate you but I love you still
In my heart I kept the flame
You'll be sorry, darling, yes you will
And hang your head in shame

I should hate you but I love you still
In my heart I kept the flame
You'll be sorry, darling, yes you will
And hang your head in shame

Yeah, and hang your little head in shame
