I'm like a cloud that drifts from town to town each new love just helps me on my way
And no one woman's ever gonna tie me down
And when one gets too close I just back up and say
I gotta be walkin' on new grass singin' a new song
Tomorrow there's no tellin' where I'll be
But I'll be walkin' on new grass singin' a new song
The next time up the road keeps callin' me

I'm warning you don't fall in love with me I don't plan on bein' here too long
You're just a leaf caught in a playfull breeze
I'll stay with you a while and then move on
I gotta be walkin' on new grass...

I won't take roots I never stay that long a bad seed just won't grow here anyway
This rolling stone don't wanna gather no moss
When the grass starts growin' I'll be on my way
I gotta be walkin' on new grass...
The next time up the road keeps callin' me
The next time up the road keeps callin' me
