Silent night holy night all is calm all is bright
Round young virgin mother and child holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace sleep in heavenly peace
(Silent night holy night shepherds quake at the sight)
Glories stream from heaven afar heavely hosts singing alleluia
Christ the Saviour is born Christ the Saviour is born
