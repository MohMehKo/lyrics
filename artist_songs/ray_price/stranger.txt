With someone else perhaps in time I'll find a little peace of mind
And maybe someday I'll get over you
And if in time I hear your name it may be hard to bear the pain
But I'll go to a stranger before I'll come to you
For a stranger might show a little sympathy
And that's so much more than you have ever done for me
And to turn away from you won't be an easy thing to do
But I'll go to a stranger before I'll come to you
For a stranger might show...
I'll go to a stranger before I'll come to you
