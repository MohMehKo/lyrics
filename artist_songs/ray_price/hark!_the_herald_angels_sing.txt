Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the new born king
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled.

Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the new born king.

(Hark the herald angels sing)
(Glory to the new born king)
(Peace on earth and mercy mild)
(God and sinners reconciled.)

Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the new born king...
