There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
He sent quiet and open air
Waits for us somewhere

There's a time for us
Someday a time for us
Time together with time to spare
Time to bear time to care

Someday, somewhere we'll find the new way of living
We'll find the way of forgiving
Somewhere there's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us

Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow, someday, somewhere
