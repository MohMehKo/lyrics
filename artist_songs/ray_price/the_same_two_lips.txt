The same two lips that once told me they love me
Are the same same two lips that now tell me goodbye
And the same two hands that once held mine so tightly
Are the same two hands that now push me aside
The same two eyes that looked at me so fondly
Are the same two eyes that look at someone else
And the same two lips I taught to say they love me
Now teach I love you to somebody else

They say that time will change us completely
And I guess that we're no different you and me
Well there was a time we got along so sweetly
But that old feeling's gone and there's nothing we can do
The same two arms that once held mine so tightly
Are the same two arms that now hold someone else
And the same two lips I taught to say I love you
Now teach I love you to somebody else
