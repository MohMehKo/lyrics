Now I don't care what anybody thinks of me
My pride is gone and here I am on bended knees
I want you and I need you that's all I know
And I'll fight the world before I'll ever let go, go

I'll gladly beg I'll steal, I will borrow
I'll turn my back on everyone I know
I'll do these things with no fear of tomorrow
I'll fight the world before I'll ever let go, go

I'll gladly beg I'll steal, I will borrow
I'll turn my back on everyone I know
I'll do these things with no fear of tomorrow
I'll fight the world before I'll ever let go, go
I'll fight the world before I'll ever let go, go
