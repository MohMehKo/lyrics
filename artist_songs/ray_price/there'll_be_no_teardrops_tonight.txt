I'll pretend I'm free from sorrow
Make believe that wrong is right
Your weddin' day will be tomorrow
So there'll be no teardrops tonight.
Why, oh why, should you desert me
Are you doing this for spite
If you only want to hurt me
Then there'll be no teardrops tonight.

I'll believe that you still love me
When you wear your veil of white
But you think that you're above me
So there'll be no teardrops tonight.
Shame, oh shame, for what you're doing
Other arms will hold you tight
You don't care whose life you ruin
So there'll be no teardrops tonight...
