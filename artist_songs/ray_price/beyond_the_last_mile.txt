I'm watching the clock tick the hours away
they say that I must hang at the dawn of the day
But why should I fear death for it's life anew
for dying only takes me much nearer to you
You left me in anger to walk by the sea
And when they found your body they blamed it on me
But you know they were wrong dear so wait for awhile
For we shall be together beyond the last mile

The stars hide their face to make way for the sun
And soon death it shall claim me and make us as one
While others are walking the streets with a smile
Then I know I'll be walking beyond the last mile
The chaplain is making his last plea to God
Soon up the numbered steps to the scaffold I'll trod
My footsteps won't falter I'll walk with a smile
For I know you'll be waiting beyond the last mile
