Well, I scorched your favorite pan this morning
Trying to make some pancakes
Spilled the grease and had to stop and mop the floor
Sat there like a little baby crying in my cornflakes
I don't think I can take it anymore
Baby come home
This is the lonesomest, lonesome I've ever known.

Late last night I woke up trembling
With my arms wrapped round your pillow
And a lump as big as Texas in my throat
Sat there in the dark and played my guitar till the sun came up
And wrote the saddest song I ever wrote
Baby come home
This is the lonesomest, lonesome I've ever known.

The lonesomest, lonesome, oh, the saddest sad
The loneliest I've ever been alone
You were the best thing this poor boy ever had
Now you're gone.

Well, tonight I'm gonna get down on my knees and say a prayer
For the first time since I can't remember when
And maybe if I'm lucky when I wake up in the morning
You'll be soft and warm beside me once again
Baby come home
This is the lonesomest, lonesome
Lonesomest, lonesome I've ever known
Baby come home...
