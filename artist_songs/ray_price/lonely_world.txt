Lonely world without you around me loneliness is all I can see
Empty hours stretch all till tomorrow lonely world is there no one for me
Lonely world there must be someone for me someone with arms to hold me tenderly
City streets I walk down alone now broken dreams I have for company
Quiet rooms that I spend my time in lonely world is there no one for me

Lonely world there must be...
