God rest ye merry gentlemen, let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Saviour was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy comfort and joy
(Oh tidings of comfort and joy)

“Fear not”, then said the angel, “Let nothing you afright
This day is born a Saviour of a pure Virgin bright
To free all those who trust in him from Satan's power and might”
Oh tidings of comfort and joy comfort and joy
(Oh tidings of comfort and joy)

Now to the Lord sing praises all you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace
This holy tide of Christmas all others doth deface
Oh tidings of comfort and joy comfort and joy
(Oh tidings of comfort and joy)
