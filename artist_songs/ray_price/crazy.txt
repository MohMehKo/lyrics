Crazy crazy for feeling so lonely I'm crazy crazy for feeling so blue
I knew you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then some day you'd leave me for somebody new
Worry why do I let myself worry wond'ring what in the world did I do to you
Crazy for thinking my love could hold you
Crazy for trying crazy for crying and I'm crazy for loving you

Crazy for trying crazy for crying and I'm crazy for loving you
