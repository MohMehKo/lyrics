You can take the lips that once kissed me
And the good times we will never know
But I'll keep the love I feel for you forever
And you can't take it with you when you go.

The time you spent with me brought you sadness
As I watched your need to leave begin to grow
So I took your every look and made myself a memory
And you can't take it with you when you go.

When you leave my life won't be empty, oh no
'Cause you're leaving more than you know
I'll have the song you taught my lonely heart to sing
And you can't take it with you when you go.

No, you can't take it with you when you go...
