Many tears ago you said you love me oh how happy was this heart of mine
Then a dark cloud came from out of nowhere and the sun went down no more to shine
Many tears ago I learned too well love what it means to bear a heavy load
I found out just what has meant by sorrow many tears ago along life's road

Many tears ago I built a castle built it very strong and very tall
Though I thought it had a firm foundation many tears ago I saw it fall
Many times I've wished that I would die love better to be dead than feel so low
All I ever lived or ever hoped for left me many many tears ogo

Many tears ago you called me darling in my dreams I hear you say it now
I can almost feel your arms around me arms that never meant to keep the vow
Many tears ago 'twas in the springtime when you said goodbye and went away
Oh how well this aching heart remembers many many tears ago today
