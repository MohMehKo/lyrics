Together again my tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights are now at an end
The key to my heart you hold in your hand
And nothing else matters we're together again

(Nothing else matters we're together again)
Together again the grey skies're gone
You're back in my arms now where you belong
The love that I knew is living again 
and nothing else matters we're together again
Nothing else matters we're together again
