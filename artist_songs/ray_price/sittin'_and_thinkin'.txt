I got loaded last night on a bottle of gin 
and I had a fight with my best girl friend
But when I'm drinkin' I am nobody's friend
Please baby wait for me until they let me out again
I know the same thing has happened before
And everytime it does I hate it more and more
But when I'm drinkin' I am nobody's friend
Please baby wait for me until they let me out again
Sittin' and just thinkin' bout you
If I didn't spend so much time sittin' and drinkin'
We'd still have the love that we once knew
Oh I won't promise that it won't happen again
But I can promise it'll be a long long time till then
Cause when I'm drinkin' I am nobody's friend
Please baby wait for me until they let me out again
Please baby wait for me until they let me out again
