Please talk to my heart because I'm lonesome pretend even if it's not true
And don't be afraid that you'll hurt me I'm hurting that's why I need you
Please please I'm so lonesome any love you can give me will do
And don't be afraid be afraid because I'm crying I'm crying that's why I need you

If you say once more that it's over don't worry because I'll be blue
You've hurt me before but can't anymore I'm hurting that's why I need you
Please please I'm so lonesome...
