When I left the trees, had no green leaves
Like your love everything had died
I said, If I ever come back to you
It'll be a cold day in July

The winter has made way for the springtime
And summer has now said hello
The leaves on the trees are green again
But in my heart it looks like snow

I'm going on on a Greyhound
I wish, I could afford to fly
A cry is not as strong as my love for you
And it looks like a cold day in July
