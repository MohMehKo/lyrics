Fancy girls out working honky tonk's a place these were a part of the good old days
When I used to swing on the south side of Chicago
Twenty first and Network was its beating heart the place with action first got it start
Back when jazz was king on the south side of Chicago
I still can hear those silver trumpets blowin' in little places filled with people glowin'
New Orleans was groovy Memphis light and gay
And who could put down New York's Broadway
But there was everything on the south side of Chicago
I still can hear those...
Yes there was everything on the south side of Chicago
