I stand on the stairway my back to the dungeon
The doorway to freedom so close to my hand
While voices behind me still bitterly damn me
For seeking salvation they don't understand
Lord help me to shoulder the burden of freedom
And give me the courage to be what I can
And when I am wounded by those who condemn me
Lord help me forgive them they don't understand

Their lonely frustration descending the laughter
Erases the footprints I leave in the sand
Now I'm free to travel where no one can follow
In search of the kingdom they don't understand
Lord help me to shoulder the burden of freedom
And give me the courage to be what I can
And when I have wounded by those who condemned me
Lord help me forgive them they don't understand
