Soft rain was falling when you told me goodbye
Thunder and lightning filled my heart inside
The love born in heaven had suddenly died
And the soft rain was teardrops for the angels all cried
If love can be perfect ours must have been
But perfection is always destroyed by men
The rain whispered softly a true love just died
And the soft rain was teardrops for the angels all cried

The rain started falling when you told me goodbye
And lightning came crashing from out of the sky
The sky that was bright blue turned slowly to grey
And the angels cried with me as you walked away
If love can be perfect ours must have been...
