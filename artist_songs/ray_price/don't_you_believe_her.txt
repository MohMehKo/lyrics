She can give you a reason to live if she wants to
She can make you forget other loves that you have known
She has two lips and two arms that thrill you as very few do
And if you want her to give them to you just ask and she will

Don't you believe her
I did, and soon she'll be leaving me
Don't you believe her
if you do then soon she'll be leaving you too

She can tell you a lie, you believe if she has to
And you'll trust her till time and the tie both stands still
She can cry on your shoulder and swear to the things
That she won't do
But be careful for when you're not looking she will

Don't you believe her
I did, and soon she'll be leaving me
Don't you believe her
If you do then soon she'll be leaving you too
