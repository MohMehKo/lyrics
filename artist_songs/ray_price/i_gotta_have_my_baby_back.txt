Baby baby I miss you so very much it hurts me baby
I just gotta I gotta have my baby back
Can't sleep can't eat because I lost my sweet baby sweet
I gotta I just gotta I gotta have my baby back
Alone in the tavern people all around laughing and dancing paintin' the town
The jukebox is playing songs about you songs with memories making me blue
Oh baby come on home without my baby I just can't get along
I gotta I just gotta I gotta have my baby back

Oh baby come on home...
