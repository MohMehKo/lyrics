[Introduction And Theme:]
When the evening sun goes down
Hi neighbors it is sundown at our house
As we make this new Columbia album for you
We wanna thank you for being so nice on our last album
It was wonderful the way you accepted it
And tonight we've chosen some of the songs
That we sing and play on our dancers across the country.
Songs that reflect the emotion of the people that live in the night life.
Songs of happiness sadness heartbreak songs of the night life
And we hope that you enjoy yourself tonight
As you'll listen to our latest songs.
This first song was written esepecially for me
By a boy from down in Texas, Willie and it accepted
So good on our dancers
We hope you like it, it's little different of what we normally do
Though we hope will be pleasant to you
So me and The Cherokee Cowboys
Are knockin' on your record player once more
And we hope that you can just kinda sit back kick off your shoes
And relax just a little bit and listen to our latest album
And if you'll like it tell us about it won't you
And we'll try to do more things for you the way we're doin' this one...

[Night Life:]
When the evening sun goes down
You will find me hanging round
Oh, the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life.

Many people just like me
Dreaming of old used-to-be
Oh, the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life.

Well, listen to the blues they're playin'
Yeah, listen to what the blues are sayin'
Mine is just another scene from the world of broken dreams
Oh, the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life.

Yeah, when the evening sun goes down
You will find me hanging round
Oh, the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life...
