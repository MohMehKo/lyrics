Hold back the rushing minutes make the wind stand still
Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill
Dry up the raindrops then hold back the sun
The world has ended, my baby's gone

I'll wake up sometime in the night and realize you're gone
I toss and turn and stare at darkness waiting for the dawn
I try to tell my lonely heart, we'll make it all alone
But still the world has ended, my baby's gone

Hold back the rushing minutes make the wind stand still
Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill
Dry up the raindrops push back the dawn
The world has ended my baby's gone
Don't they know the world has ended, my baby's gone
