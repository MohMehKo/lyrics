I look at your picture too often it helps keep your mem'ry alive
It's not healthy they say to relive yesterday but for me it's the way to survive
I must cling to what's gone if I've to go on I can't face the future I've tried
Perhaps for the rest looking back isn't best but for me it's the way to survive

When my heart aches I read all your letters and the words make our love seem alive
They say I can't last if I live in the past but for me it's the way to survive
I must cling to what's gone
