My mamma told me, that she would buy me
A Rubber Dolly if I'd be good
But don't you tell her
I've got to fail her
Or she won't buy me no Rubber Dolly

No Rubber Dolly, no Rubber Dolly
She won't buy me no Rubber Dolly

My mamma told me, that she would buy me
A stick of candy if I'd be good
But don't you tell her
I've got to fail her
Or she won't buy me no stick of candy

No stick of candy, no stick of candy
She won't buy me no stick of candy
