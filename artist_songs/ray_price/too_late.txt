Too late too late to ask forgiveness too late too late for me to cry
You've gone you've gone you left this morning I should have known you'd say goodbye
You know I love you as no other but you have played around too long
Goodbye good luck and don't forget me although I know that you are wrong
Too late too late my heart keeps saying I should have known you'd never try
But you can't change your way of living I know that there's no use to cry

You know I love you as no other...
