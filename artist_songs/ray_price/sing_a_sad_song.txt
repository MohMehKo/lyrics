Sing me a song of sadness and make it as blue as I feel
If a tear should appear it's because she's not here sing a sad song and sing it for me
She's unhappy with me she told me so I'm unhappy without her and I still love her so
Sing me a song of sadness pretend it's the end of the world
Sing it soft and sing it low and then I'll must go
Sing a sad song and sing it for me
