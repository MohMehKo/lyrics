My world is like a river as dark as it is deep
Night after night the past slips in and gathers all my sleep
My days are just an endless stream of emptiness for me
Filled only by the fleeting moments of her memories
Sweet memories, sweet memories, I'm clinging to her memories

She slipped into the silence of my dreams last night
Wandering from room to room turning on each light
Her laughter spills like water from the river to the sea
I'm swept away from sadness clinging to her memories
Sweet memories, sweet memories, I'm clinging to her memories
