Every night I bow my head
And say a prayer for daily bread
Tonight I ask a greater cry
Make me wonderful in her eyes

Expose my heart and lay it there
Let her see the love that's there
Usual hours so great and white
Make me wonderful in her eyes

Let her look at me through the eyes of love
And treasure me the skies above
Let her vision and behold
Come near up of my very soul

Reflect our love the twice it's side
Make me wonderful in her eyes
Make me wonderful in her eyes
