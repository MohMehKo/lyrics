I'm gettin' tired of roamin' around I'm gettin' tired of paintin' the town
Bright lights and blonde haired women don't thrill me
I'm gettin' tired of being lived up like a Christmas tree
I guess I done everything there is to do you said it would be this way
Believe me baby I'm all through please let me come home to you
I'm gettin' tired of roamin' around I'm gettin' tired of paintin' the town
I'm tired of blonde haired women oh don't thrill me
I'm gettin' sick and tired being lived up like a Christmas tree
I guess I done everything there is to do you said it would be this way
Believe me baby I'm all through please let me please let me come home to you
