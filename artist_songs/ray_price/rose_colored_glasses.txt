Rose Colored Glasses 
A perfect kind of love is what you want from me 
if I could I'd gladly give you more
But I know that I can never paint for you
the rosie pictures you are searching for
You're wearing rose colored glasses 
everywhere you go
Cause you only want to see the brighter sight
You're wearing rose colored glasses 
cause someone hurt you so
And rose colored glasses help you hide

You're wearing rose colored glasses 
everywhere you go
Cause you only want to see the brighter side
You're wearing rose colored glasses 
cause someone hurt you so
And rose colored glasses help you hide
