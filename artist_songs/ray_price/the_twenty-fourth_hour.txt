There are twenty-three hours that I can get by
But the twenty-fourth hour is the one when I cry
I pray that it won't come, but it comes anyhow
And the twenty-fourth hour is right about now

Right about now, the heartaches start calling
Right about now, the teardrops start falling
The late show is over and there's no place to go
And it's right about now, that I miss you you so

I start counting the hours when daylight begins
Or I know that when night comes, just how it will end
I pray that it won't come, but it comes anyhow
And the twenty-fourth hour is right about now

Right about now, the heartaches start calling
Right about now, the teardrops start falling
The late show is over and there's no place to go
And it's right about now, that I miss you you so
