Black and white lies from left to right
Are in the letter I write tonight
I stopped being lonely when you left
And I'm now, at the top, among the best

I have money, throw big parties
And have a lots of friends, I never lose, I just win
I'm sending back the picture
That you sent me of our two lovely children

Tell them both to forget me
And I don't wish to see them again

Black and white lies from left to right
Are in the letter I write tonight
What else is new except that you are married again
I hope you'll be happy with him

I'm sending you my best wishes
Consider me your best friend
Black and white lies from left to right
Are in the letter I write tonight

And I'm hoping, she'll believe what I write tonight
When she'll read this letter of lies in black and white
