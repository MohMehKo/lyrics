I love you because you understand dear every single thing I try to do
You're always there to lend a helping hand dear
I love you most of all because you're you
No matter what the world may say about me
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for the way you never doubt me but most of all I love you cause you're you

I love you because my heart is lighter every time I'm walking by your side
I love you because my future's brighter the door to happiness you've opened wide
No matter what may be the style or seasons I know your heart will always be true
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
But most of all I love you because you're you
