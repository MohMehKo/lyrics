There are twenty-three hours that I can't get by
But the 24th hour is the one when I cry
I pray that it won't come but it comes anyhow
And the 24th hour is right about now

Right about now the heartaches start calling
Right about now the teardrops start falling
The late show is over and there's no place to go
And it's right about now that I miss you you so

I start counting the hours when daylight began
For I know that when night comes just how it will end
I pray that it won't come but it comes anyhow
And the 24th hour is right about now

Right about now the heartaches start calling...
