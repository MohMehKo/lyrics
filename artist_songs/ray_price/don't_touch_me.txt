Your hand is like a torch
Each time you touch me, the look in your eyes pulls me apart
Don't open the door to heaven if I can't come in
Don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart

Your kiss is like a drink
When I'm thirsty and I'm thirsty for you with all my heart
But don't love me then act like we've never kissed
Oh, don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart

Don't give me something you might take away
To have you then lose, you wouldn't be smart on my part
Don't open the door to heaven if I can't come in
Oh, don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart

Don't give me something you might take away
To have you then lose, you wouldn't be smart on my part
Don't open the door to heaven if I can't come in
Oh, don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart
Don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart
