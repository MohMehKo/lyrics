Please don't leave me dear I love you I have place no one above you
And I'm always thing of you please don't leave I love you
Please don't leave me dear I need you can't you see how much I need you
On my knees I beg and plead you please don't leave I love you
I need you more than my world needs the sunlight
Because it's you that makes my world bright
Don't you love me just a little don't you need me just a little
Don't you want me just a little please don't leave I love you

I need you more
