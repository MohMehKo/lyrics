You don't listen even when I beg you not to leave
You don't hear what I'm saying 'cause you pay no attention to me
And when you come home after being gone you have no alibi
'Cause you don't even care enough to lie.

Would it take you very long to notice if I'm gone
If sometimes I wasn't here when you came home
You know I know where you go but you don't try to hide
'Cause you don't even care enough to lie.

Would it take you very long to notice if I'm gone
If sometimes I wasn't here when you came home
You know I know where you go but you don't try to hide
'Cause you don't even care enough to lie...
