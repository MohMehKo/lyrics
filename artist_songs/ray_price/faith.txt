You must have faith in everything you do
Faith will help you find the way faith will see you through
Faith can move mountains and change the tides of sea
You can follow this guiding light wherever you may be
Like the darkness comes at the end of the day there must be an end to the night
And from the depths of your darkest moment faith will show you the light
Yes you must have faith in everything you do
Faith will help you find the way faith will see you through

And from the depths of your darkest moment...
