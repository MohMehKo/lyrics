The sun just went behind the clouds
There's darkness all around me now
For I've just destroyed the world I'm living in
I broke her so many times
And now at last I've broken mine
I've just destroyed the world I'm living in.
What made me think that I could go on hurting her
I should have known there'd have to be an end
But fools in love I thought by fate
they never learn till it's too late
And I've just destroyed the world I'm living in.

What made me think that I could go on hurting her
I should have known there'd have to be an end
But fools in love I thought by fate
they never learn till it's too late
And I've just destroyed the world I'm living in...
