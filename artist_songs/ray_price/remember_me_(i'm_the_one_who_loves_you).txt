When you're all alone and blue no one to tell your troubles to
Remember me I'm the one who loves you
And when the world has turned you down and not a true friend can be found
Remember me I'm the one who loves you
And through all kinds of weather you'll find I'll never change
Through the sunshine and the shadows I'll always be the same
We're together right or wrong and where you go I'll tag along
Remember me I'm the one who loves you

And through all kinds of weather...
