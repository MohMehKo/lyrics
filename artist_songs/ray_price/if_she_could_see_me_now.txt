I saw the one I loved and lost last night again
I smiled and said hello like we were still old friends
Don't pitty me it never matter anyhow
But oh, if she could see me now.

If she could see me now when the night life's gone
I'd sat I really looked without my party face on
The way I just give up sit down and cry out loud
But oh, if she could see me now.

I'm first at every party and the last to leave
And no one sees the hurt that's deep inside of me
I drink too much and say who wants her anyhow
But oh, if she could see me now.

If she could see me now when the night life's gone
I'd sat I really looked without my party face on
The way I just give up sit down and cry out loud
But oh, if she could see me now...
