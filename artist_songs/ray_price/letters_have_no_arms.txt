I just got your letter dear sweetheart and darling I miss you oh so much
Your letter has cheered me but I'm lonesome lonesome just to feel your loving touch
Letters have no arms dear to hold me kisses on paper are so cold
These sweet things you write in your letter I wanna be with you dear when told
Letters never bring me the touch of your hand or none of your sweet loving charms
I get so lonesome for you darling and you know that letters have no arms

Letters have no arms dear to hold me...
