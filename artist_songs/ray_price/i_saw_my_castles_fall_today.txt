I saw my castles fall today and crumble into dust around my feet
In shambles there my future lay each stone a broken dream so sweet
I built the heaven in the sky where my true love and I could stay
Then came the words that meant goodbye I saw my castles fall today

Amid the ruins of all my schemes there's nothing else to do or say
I'll say goodbye to all my dreams I saw my castles fall today
