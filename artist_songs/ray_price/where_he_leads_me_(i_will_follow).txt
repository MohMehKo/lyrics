I can hear my saviour calling
I can hear my saviour calling
I can hear my saviour calling
Take thy cross and follow, follow me

Where he leads me I will follow
Where he leads me I will follow
Where he leads me I will follow
I'll go with him with him all the way

I'll go with him through the judgement
I'll go with him through the judgement
I'll go with him through the judgement
I'll go with him with him all the way

Where he leads me I will follow
