There's a picture that I carry 
One we made some time ago 
If they ask who's in the picture with me
I say just a girl I used to know 

Just a girl I used to go around with 
Just a friend from long ago
I don't tell them how lost I am without her 
I say sheâ€™s just a girl I used to know  

I say she's just another girl now 
Just a flame that's lost its glow 
And I say her name has slipped my mind now 
And she's just a girl I used to know 

Just a girl I used to spend some time with
Just a friend from long ago 
I don't talk about the nights I cried about her 
I say she's just a girl I used to know 
Just a girl I used to know
