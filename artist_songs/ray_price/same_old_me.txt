When I saw you with your new love today
It hurt me in an old familiar way
And I know there's nothing I can do
But I'll always be here, waiting just for you

With the same two arms, still missing you
And the same old heart, still being true
And the same two lips, they still belong to you
And the same old me keeps loving you

I have tried everything to drive you from my heart
But the memory of you makes me feel so blue
And with every heartbeat I can feel the teardrops start
So, you'll always find me waiting here for you

With the same two arms, still missing you
And the same old heart, still being true
And the same two lips, they still belong to you
And the same old me keeps loving you
