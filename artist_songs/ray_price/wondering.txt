Wondering, wondering who's kissing you
Wondering, wondering if you're wondering too

Every hour of the day since you've been away
I keep wondering, yes, wondering if you're wondering too

Every night I pray to the good Lord above
To send back to me the one I really love

Wondering, wondering who's kissing you
Wondering, wondering if you're wondering too

Every night I pray to the good Lord above
To send back to me the one I really love
