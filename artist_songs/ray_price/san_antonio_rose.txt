Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I lived with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love

Moon and all your splendor knows only my heart
Call back my Rose Rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals fallin' apart
Speak once again of my love my own
Oh broken song empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass beside the Alamo
And calls my Rose of San Antone

Moon and all your splendor...
