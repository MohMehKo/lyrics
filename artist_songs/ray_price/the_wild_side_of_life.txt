You wouldn't read the letter that I wrote you
You told me not to call you on the phone
But there's something that I just got to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song.

I didn't know God made honky tonk angels
I might have known you'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one who ever loved you
And went back to the wild side of life.

The glamour of the gay night life has lured you
To the places where the wine and liquor flow
Where you wait to be anybody's baby
And forget the truest love you'll ever know.

I didn't know God made honky tonk angels
I might have known you'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one who ever loved you
And went back to the wild side of life...
