We've been sweethearts for so long
Now you say we're thru
The love we shared is just a memory
Well I had built a ship of dreams
And planned them all for you
Now I guess what is to be will be.

So I'll sail my ship alone
With all the dreams I own
Drifting out across the ocean blue
I'll sail my ship alone
Tho' all the sails are torn
And when it starts to sink then I'll blame you.

I gave a message to the wind
To take back home to you
Hoping you would hear my S-O-S
Hoping that you would come back home
My darling if you knew
Just how much my heart was in distress.

So I'll sail my ship alone
With all the dreams I own
Drifting out across the ocean blue
I'll sail my ship alone
Tho' all the sails are torn
And when it starts to sink then I'll blame you
