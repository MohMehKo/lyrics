Your heart is too crowded with your new love by your side
That you can't see how much I cried
You're too busy with your romance to remember all those lies
Or ever notice how I was hurt inside
I use to be the only one I was your sweetheart
Then another came along he plays a leading part
Your heart is too crowded with your new love by your side
That you can't see my heart cries to die

Should I hold you close again just for old time sake
Maybe you'd remember my embrace
Why dream of things that are gone can't ever be again
Cause your hearts too crowded to ever let me in
I use to be the only one...
