Hello heart it's me again do you remember
I was the one that caused you all that bitter pain
I promised then if you would just keep on beating
I'd never put you through this kind of hurt again

But she keeps burning on my mind and I don't know what to do
Forgive me heart I know what I promised you

Get ready heart now brace yourself I've got to call her
And though she hurt me I've got to know the reason why
She came into my life and said she loves me
And walked away didn't even say goodbye

But she keeps burning on my mind I don't know what to do
Forgive me heart I know what I promised you

I don't know where to draw the line and like the blind leading the blind
Forgive me heart I know you love her too
forgive me heart I know I promised you
