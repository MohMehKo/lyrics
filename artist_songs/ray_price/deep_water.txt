I'm drifting into deep water
I'm startin' to care for you
You're getting me in deep water
Be careful what you do

You wanna romance but I'm seeking love
I know I'll regret it when it ends
I'm winding off in deep water
Why can't we just be friends

It's restless in this deep water
I'm lost between right and wrong
My love is true as deep water
Your love won't last this long

Where will it lead me and where will it end
I can't help but wish I only knew
I'm winding up in deep water
So deep in love with you
