What strange power do you have that ruins this life of mine
That controls the hearts that's beating for you all the time
And if I could drive you from my heart a day or two
Then I'd find the way to free myself from you.

I would find the way to free myself, I know will
Then the very thought of you no more will cause a chill
And when I wake up to all the things you put me through
Then I'd find the way to free myself from you.

I will find the way to free myself, I know will
Then the very thought of you no more will cause a chill
And when I wake up to all the things you put me through
Then I'd find the way to free myself from you...
