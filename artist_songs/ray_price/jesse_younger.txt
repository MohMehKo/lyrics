Little Jesse Younger was a well respected lad
Doin' all he could do to please his mommy and his dad
But he never planned to be the man they said that he'd become

Somehow or another now his little baby brother
Is his father's and his mother's only son

Everyday the neighbors say that it's a dirty shame
The way we spat upon his family and scandalized their name
And his parents never really ever said he'd been his own

Somehow or another now his little baby brother
Is his father's and his mother's only son

Oh, Jesse Younger, you're a devil not a man
Can you dare to teach your parents so unkind
You have selfishly refused to live your life the way they planned
And you started goin' your own way and speaking your own mind

Jesse Younger's parents wonder where it all went wrong
Now that Jesse's name is turned to ashes on their tongues
But he chose to start and try to cover future of his own

And he got his rathers because now his younger brother
Is his father's and his mother's only son
