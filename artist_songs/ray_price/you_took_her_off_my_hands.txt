You took her off my hands when you've stepped in
You changed everything we're not even friends
Don't leave the job half done leave nothing behind
You took her off my hands now please take her off my mind
Please take her photograph my heart's so blue
And take all her memories she now belongs to you
Don't leave the job half done leave nothing behind
You took her off my hands now please take her off my mind

Please take her photograph...
