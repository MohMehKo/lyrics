Though men may strife to go beyond the reap of space
To crawl beyond the distant shining stars
This world's a room so small within my Master's house
The open sky's but a portion of his yard

How big is God? How big and wide is His domain?
To try to tell these lips can only start
He's big enough to rule his mighty universe
Yet small enough to live within my heart

As winter chill may cause the tiny seed to fall
To lie asleep till waked by summer's rain
The heart grown cold will warm and trod with life anew
The Master's touch will bring the glow again

How big is God? How big and wide is His domain?
To try to tell these lips can only start
He's big enough to rule his mighty universe
Yet small enough to live within my heart

God's small enough to live within my heart
