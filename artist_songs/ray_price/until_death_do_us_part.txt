I call you on the phone but to me you're not at home
Even though your name is still the same as mine
Your thoughts are not of me and everyone can see
That someone else is taking up your time
Oh I will always love you though you break my heart each day
I'll go right on carying dear in the sam heartaching way
I know that you're not thinking of how you broke my heart
But I will always love you till death do us part

Oh I will always love you...
