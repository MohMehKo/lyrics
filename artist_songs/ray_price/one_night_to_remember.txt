It's funny now that it's ending
The guilt we've been feeling is gone
We both know tomorrow I'm leaving
And tonight our love don't seem so wrong.

So let's give ourselves one night to remember
One night we can call our own
A few borrowed moments to hold to forever
Just one night before I'm gone.

Surely we owe it to each other
One night to go with us from now on
These moments are our last ones together
And we've denied our feelings for so lone.

So let's give ourselves one night to remember
One night we can call our own
A few borrowed moments to hold to forever
Just one night then I'll be gone...
