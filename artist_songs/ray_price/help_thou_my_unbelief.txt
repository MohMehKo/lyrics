The wond'rous gift that Jesus offers me if I but lift my heart desiresly
The only ways the venture of my face
To prove the miracle of his redeeming grace
I stumble over such simplicity Lord I do believe help Thou my unbelief
Must I refuse the gift until I understand
It's mine the moment that I let him take my hand

Lord will within my heart the will to obey
Break my stubborn will that stands in the way
I would know the miracle of sweet relief
Lord I do believe help Thou my unbelief
(Lord I do believe I do believe)
