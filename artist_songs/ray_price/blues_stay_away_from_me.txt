Blues stay away from me 
blues why don't you let me be
I Don't know why
you keep on haunting me
Love was never meant for me
true love was never meant for me
Seems somehow we never can agree

Life is full of misery 
dreams are like a memory
bringing back your love that used to be
Tears so many I can't see
years don't mean a thing to me
Time goes by and still I can't be free
Blues stay away from me 
blues why don't you let me be
I Don't know why
you keep on haunting me
