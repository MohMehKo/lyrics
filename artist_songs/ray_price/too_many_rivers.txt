I wish I could come back to you dear cause I know that you want me to
But too much waters run under that old bridge
There's too many rivers between me and you
There's too many rivers to cross dear and too many dreams have been lost
And there's too many long nights that I've turned and tossed
There's just too many rivers to cross

Now don't think for moments I blame only you we both killed the fruit on the vine
And when you try to put love back together
There's always a few little pieces you can't find
There's too many rivers
