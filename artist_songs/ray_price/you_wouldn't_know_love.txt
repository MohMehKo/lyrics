(You wouldn't know love if it look you in the eye)
You look at me but you don't see me I talk to you but you don't hear me
Your indifference just beats all I've ever seen
I tell you I love you but you don't know what that word means
For much too long I've tried so hard to hide

The way you've treated me and the way you've hurt my pride
Even a blind man could see what you let go by
You wouldn't know love if it looked you in the eye
For much too long
You wouldn't know love if it looked you in the eye
