If the world keeps on turning as I'm sure it's bound to do then I'll keep on loving you
If the dawn comes tomorrow and we know that it is true then I'll keep of loving you
What the thing changes sky to fall the dawn wouldn't come the world wouldn't stall
I wouldn't care as long as you're near it wouldn't matter to me at all
If the stars stay in heaven and the moon stays in the blue then I'll keep of loving you

If I ever should lose you then I know just what I'll do I'll just keep on loving you
You are heaven to me dear you are every dream come true and I'll keep of loving you
Life is so sweet when you are near I couldn't do without you my dear
I love you so I want you to know I think of you wherever I go
I will always be faithful and I'm sure that you will too and I'll keep of loving you
