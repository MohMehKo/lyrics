I thought that a love that was true'd never die that nothing could keep us apart
We promised to ever be faithful and true we promised and we crossed our hearts
We crossed our hearts it was sealed with a kiss and vowed that we never would part
The seal it was broken by somebody else and you must have uncrossed your heart

What good is a promise that's broken so true or castles that's built in the sky
What good are the vows that you made me that day
When you crossed your heart with a lie
You played careless hands on the strings of my heart
And I guess you thought you were smart
For then you deceived me for somebody else so you must have uncrossed your heart
