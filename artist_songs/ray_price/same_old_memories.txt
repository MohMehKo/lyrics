You said that you'd come back and start all over
Our love would be the way it used to be
But you just want me when there are no other
You play your game so you come back to me
The same old memories are back just like they were before
The same old memories and everytime they hurt me more
You're happy when my heart is on its knees hurting with the same old memories

The same old memories...
