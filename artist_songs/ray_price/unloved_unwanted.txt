Unloved unwanted I've never been so blue
I know that I should leave but I don't want to
Unloved unwanted is the life I live with you
I know that I should leave but I don't want to
You have my name you wear my ring I remember when our love was real
You're in his arms he has your heart
Are you happy with the kisses that you steal
Unloved unwanted I've never been so blue
I know that I should leave but I don't want to

You have my name...
