Tonight in the bar alone I'm sitting
Apart from the laughter and the cheer
Scenes from the past rise before me
While watchin' the bubbles in my beer

A vision of someone who loved me
Brings a lone silent tear to my eye
I know that my life's been a failure
Just watchin' the bubbles in my beer

I'm seeing the road that I traveled
A road paved with heartaches and tears
I'm seeing the past that I've wasted
While watchin' the bubbles in my beer

I think of the heart that I've broken
And the golden chances that have passed me by
The dreams I've once made, now are empty
As empty as the bubbles in my beer
