Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious memories flood my soul

In sad hours, when I'm lonely
The truth of Jesus' love is told
In the silence of the midnight
Precious memories hurt my soul

Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the silence of the midnight
Precious secrets seems unfold
