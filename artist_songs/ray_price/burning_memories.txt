(Burning mem'ries burning mem'ries memories of you that I can't lose)
Tonight I'm burning old love letters photographs and memories of you
Hoping somehow I'll feel better and when the smoke is gone I won't want you
Burning mem'ries teardrops fall while I am
Burning mem'ry burning all the memories of you that I can't lose
My heart to you no longer matters and I can't live alone with memories
Into the fire those dreams you've shattered
And when the smoke is gone then I'll be free
Burning mem'ries teardrops fall while I am
Burning mem'ry burning all the memories of you that I can't lose
