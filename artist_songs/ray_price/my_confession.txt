Sweetheart, I'm all alone tonight
Thinking about my wasted past
I see that you were always right
And now I'm at your feet at last

Take my heart and let it live
This is all I have to give
So please believe me when I say
For all the wrongs I've done I'll pay

Sweetheart, you know I love you
So why did I ever let you go
In dreams you're all that I can see
So won't you reconsider me

My confession to you, dear
Makes me shed a silent tear
My heart would be so light, sweetheart
If you would say we'll never part
