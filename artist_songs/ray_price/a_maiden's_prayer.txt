Twilight falls,
Evening shadows find,
There 'neath the stars a maiden so fair divine.

The moon on high seemed to see her there,
In her eyes was a light shining ever so bright,
As she whisper'd a silent pray'r.

Ev'ry word revealed an empty, broken heart;
Broken by fate that holds them so far apart.

Lonely there she kneels, and tells the stars above,
In her arms he belongs, then her pray'r is a song,
Her unending song of love.
