Love that runs away from me
Dreams that just won't let me be
Blues that keep on bothering me
Change that just won't set me free
To far away from you and all you're charms
Just out of reach of my two empty arms.

Each night in dreams I see your face
Memories time can not erase
Then I awake and find you gone
I'm so blue and all alone
So far away from lips so sweet and warm
Just out of reach of my two empty arms.

Ah honey, you know that old lonesome feeling that I have all the time
It's just knowing that I know you'll never be mine
And the dreams that always keeps on hurting in my mind
I know we're only bound that she and I could never be.

To far away from lips so sweet and warm
Just out of reach of my two empty arms.

Just out of reach of my two empty arms
