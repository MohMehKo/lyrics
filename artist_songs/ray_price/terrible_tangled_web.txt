You've got a way of makin' me blue and I've got a way of hurtin' you too
Oh what a terrible tangled web we're we
You've got a gentleman of the side and I've got a friend that I'm tryin' to hide
Oh what a terrible tangled web we're we

We both got our way of goin' our way knowin' the cost gets greater each day
And I know you know we both know we both deceive
We've got a way of livin' a lie and lie's got a way of makin' us cry
Oh what a terrible tangled web we're we

Why'd've we have to settle for it how can we take too much more
It figures we both got the nerve to leave
We've got a way of livin' a lie...
Oh what a terrible tangled web we're we
