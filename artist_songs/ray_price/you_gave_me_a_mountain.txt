Born in the heat of the desert my mother died giving me life
Deprived of the love of a father blamed for the loss of his wife
You know Lord I've been in a prison for something that I've never done
It's been one hill after another but I've climbed them all one by one

But this time Lord you gave me a mountain a mountain I may never climb
And it isn't a hill any longer you gave me a mountain this time
My woman got tired of the hardships tired of the grief and the strife
So tired of working for nothing tired of being my wife

She took my one ray of sunshine she took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living she took my small baby boy
So this time Lord you gave me
