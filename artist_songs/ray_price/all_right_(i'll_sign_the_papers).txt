I've tried so hard to keep our home alive
But you don't even know that I'm around
You tell me that somehow our love has died
And you'd rather be set free than be tied down

All right, I'll sign the papers
Even though you know I love you so
All right, I'll sign the papers
But oh, how it hurts to see you go

I've laid awake at nights when you were gone
And thought of all the things that I could do
To try and make you happy when you come home
But the more I try, the more you make me blue

All right, I'll sign the papers
Even though you know I love you so
All right, I'll sign the papers
But oh, how it hurts to see you go
