Well, I haven't got a worry, I haven't got a care
Haven't got a thing to call my own
And though I'm out of money, I'm a millionaire
I'm a native son of San Antone

And, when I greet my neighbor with a 'Hi y'all'
I'm welcomed as a king upon a throne
And when I feel like braggin', I'll just step and say
I'm a native son of San Antone

I traveled over the country on my merry way
Been in crowds and felt I was alone
When I feel like braggin', I'll just step and say
I'm a native son of San Antone

There's a sweet somebody by the Alamo
Someday, she's gonna be my very own
And then we'll build a highchair in a year or so
For our little home in San Antone
For our little home in San Antone
