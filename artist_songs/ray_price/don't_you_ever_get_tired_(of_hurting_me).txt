You make my eyes run over all the time
You're happy when I'm out of my mind
You don't love me, but you won't let me be
Don't you ever get tired of hurting me?

You must think I look bad with a smile
For you haven't let me wear one in such a long, long while
Still I keep running back
Why must this be?
Don't you ever get tired of hurting me?

Someone must have hurt you long ago
But why take revenge on one who loves you so
You don't need me, but you won't let me be
Don't you ever get tired of hurting me?

You must think I look bad with a smile
For you haven't let me wear one in such a long, long while
Still I keep running back
Why must this be?
Don't you ever get tired of hurting me?
Don't you ever get tired of hurting me?
