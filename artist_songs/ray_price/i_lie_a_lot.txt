I say that I don't miss you if they ask me if I do
I lie a lot that's what I do
I'm not own because I'm blue there's just nothing I want to do
Oh I lie a lot if they ask about you
Do you have to lie when they ask about me
Or is it true when you tell them you're glad that you're free
I wish it was that easy to pretend that I'd forgot
When I say that I don't miss you I lie a lot

Do you have to lie...
