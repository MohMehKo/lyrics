I'm gonna start in the hall take the pictures off the wall and burn them
Move the chairs around take the window curtains down and burn them
Everything I see reminds me you were here
I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of you
Take the carpet off the floor throw it out the door it's filled with tears
Everything I find that brings you to my mind must disappear
Every night I dream I'll dream of someone new
I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of you

The candle of your set you gave me on the night of my birthday
The records that you bought the hi-fi we loved to play
The decorating man will come and rearrange them
I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of you
I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of you
