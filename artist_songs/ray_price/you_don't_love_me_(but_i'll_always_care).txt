Yesterday brought love as sweet as clover
Every kiss was fresh as morning rain
But today you told me it's over
And my heart is burdened down with pain
Though it hurts me when you are so cold dear
And you know our love's beyon repair
Our love cheapen what was pure as gold dear
You don't love me but I'll always care

Darling I am glad that I have known you
Every sorrow that we have to share
And in dreams I know I'll always own you
You don't love me but I'll always care
Though it hurts me when you are so cold dear...
