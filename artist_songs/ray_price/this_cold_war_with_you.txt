The sun goes down it leaves me sad and blue
The iron curtain falls on this cold war with you
For you won't speak and I won't speak it's true
Two stubborn people with a cold war to go through
Why oh why should love ever come to couples like you and me
Whose cold cold wars are never done and whose hearts just can't be free
So let's make up or let's just say we're through
I just can't stand another cold cold war with you
Why oh why should love ever come...
