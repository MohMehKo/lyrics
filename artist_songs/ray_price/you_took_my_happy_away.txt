When I was with you I was happy but you took my happy away
You'll have to go leave me lonely and my lonely just won't go away
I told you I told you I'm sorry my sorry gets bigger each day
With you in my arms I'd be happy but you took my happy away

You must know by now how I need you but you treat my need you so wrong
You must know by now how I love you so don't wait till my love you is gone
I told you I told you I'm sorry...
