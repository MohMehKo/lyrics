Well, she didn't look as pretty as some others I have known
And she wasn't good at conversation when we were alone
But she had a way of making me believe that I belong
And it felt like coming home when I found her.

'Cause she seemed to be so proud of me just walking holding hands
And she didn't think that money was a measure of a man
And we seemed to fit together when I held her in my arms
And it left me feeling warm when I found her.

'Cause she brightened up the day like the early morning sun
She made what I was doing seem worthwhile
It's the closest thing to living that I guess I've ever known
And it made me want to smile when I loved her.

I know some of us were born to cast our fortunes to the winds
And I guess I'm bound to travel down a road that never ends
But I know I'll never look upon the likes of her again
And I'll never understand why I lost her.

'Cause she brightened up the day like the early morning sun
She made what I was doing seem worthwhile
It's the closest thing to living that I guess I've ever known
And it made me want to smile when I loved her.

And it made me want to smile when I loved her...
