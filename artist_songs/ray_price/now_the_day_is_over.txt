Now the day is over night is drawing nigh
Shadows of the evening steal across the sky

Jesus give the weary come in sweet repose
With Thy tender blessings may arise be close

When the morning awakens then the eye arise
Pure and fresh and sinless in the holy eyes
(Pure and fresh and sinless in the holy eyes)
