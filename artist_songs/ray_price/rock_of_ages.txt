Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee
Let the water and the blood from Thy wounded side which fload
Thee of sin the double cure save from raft and make me pure

(Save from raft and make me pure)
Could my tears forever flow could my zeal no languor know
These for sin could not atone Thou must save and Thou alone
In my hand no price I bring simply to Thy cross I cling

(Simply to Thy cross I cling)
While I draw this pleading breath when my eyes shall close in death
When I rise the world unknown and behold the own Thy throne
Rock of ages cleft for me let me hime myself in Thee
(Rock of ages)
