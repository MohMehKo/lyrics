I gave you everything that you asked for
I never criticized the things you do
Now I see what I'm letting myself in for
I'm afraid that too much love is spoiling you
When there's not enough love that means a broken hearted game
What I was to know that too much love will always do the same
More and more you are taking me for granted
I do every single thing you want me to
It may be wrong but I know I'll never change it
It's my fault if too much love is spoiling you

When there's not enough love...
