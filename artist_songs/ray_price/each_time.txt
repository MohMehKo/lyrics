Each time I close my eyes
I get a little sense of love
It flows deep inside
But when I want to Tell those three words
I just cant face you
Just cant face you...
Its been such a long journey
Feels like were joined at the heart
Oh, what I wouldn't give
For you to be in love with me
Would have been nice
In the very first start
When my heart begins to beat
The power takes over me
Ooh, if you only knew
How much I would do for you
Maybe you would love me, too
But, still...
Each time I close my eyes
I get a little sense of love
It flows deep inside
But when I want to Tell those three words
I just cant face you
Just cant face you, oh...
Its been such a long time
Since I felt love was true what I wouldn't lose
For you to stare into my eyes
Just like you've done before
But I don't think you knew
When my heart begins to beat
The power takes over me
Ooh, if you only knew
How much I would do for you
Maybe you would love me, too
But, still...
Each time I close my eyes
I get a little sense of love
It flows deep inside
But when I want to Tell those three words
I just cant face you
Just cant face you, oh...
Wish I could Let my lips move
But each time
I cant tell you
Just how I feel
Boy, its for real
Wish I could
Reach out to you
So I can say
That I love you
Want you to know
I want to be there
When you're hurting...
