Ice cold love
Your love is cold as ice cold
I wish I knew someone
To love me like I love you

This morning when you went away, I'm wondering dear
If you're gonna stay away
I see a pretty rainbow
It reminds me I love you so

I remember dear
When your lips were warm as fire
You said, you love me so
But now it's awful cold the ice cold heart

This morning when you went away, I'm wondering dear
If you're gonna stay away
I see a pretty rainbow
It reminds me I love you so

I remember dear
When your lips were warm as fire
You said, you love me so
But now it's awful cold the ice cold heart
