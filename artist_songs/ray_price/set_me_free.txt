If you think you've had enough if you think our life's been rough
Why not take your love line off of me and set me free
If you think our love's all wrong and you feel the fire's all gone
If that's not what you'd like for me to be come set me free
Set me free and let me fly like a bluebird up in the sky
Release the chain that's binding you and me and set me free

Set me free and let me fly
