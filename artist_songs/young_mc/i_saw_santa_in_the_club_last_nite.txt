[Chorus:]
I saw Santa in the club last night
Belly and beard and red and white
Doing his thing in boots and tights
Yo I saw Santa in the club last night
I saw Santa in the club last night
Belly and beard and red and white
Doing his thing in boots and tights
Yo I saw Santa in the club last night

[Verse 1:]
Out to the club on Christmas eve
Check my wardrobe before I leave
Pretty young thing hanging on my sleeve 
Gonna have a good time you best believe
Hit the ride and I'm on my way
Driving up as the music play
But in the vip valley was a shiny one horse open sleigh
I walked inside and I heard the sound
The music from the underground
On the floor the people gathered round 
To see this fat man gettin' down
A sight to see in this disco light
But there he was getting down all right 
His dance was slick, his moves were tight
Yo I saw Santa in the club last night

[Chorus:]
I saw Santa in the club last night
Belly and beard and red and white
Doing his thing in boots and tights
Yo I saw Santa in the club last night
I saw Santa in the club last night
Belly and beard and red and white
Doing his thing in boots and tights
Yo I saw Santa in the club last night

[Verse 2:]
Dasher and prancer and dancer and vixen 
Bobbed their heads to the dj mixing
Comet and cupid and donner and blitzen
Were out in the back getting snacks from the kitchen
But rudolph man he was the troop
Runnin light from the dj booth
Making sure that they flashed on beat
Taaping hoofs like you tap your feet
But there he was jolly old saint nick 
Two stepped in with the disco chick
The people joined him the floor was thick
With numbers high like arithmetic
But were's the bag no gift in sight
They must be somewhere locked down tight
I knew had them when he took flight
Yo I saw Santa in the club last night!

[Repeat chorus]

[Verse 3:]
On the first noel angels did sing
Cause this year Santa is doing his thing
With a hohoho and a sleigh bell ring
We knew that he was the dancing king
He took the reindeer and went outside
Got on the sleigh and began to ride
And I thought to myself as he rode on his sleigh
Yo I saw Santa in the club last night!

[Repeat chorus]

[Bridge:]
I saw Santa I saw Santa
I saw Santa I saw Santa
I saw Santa I saw Santa
I saw Santa in the club last night!

[Repeat chorus]

[Repeat chorus]
