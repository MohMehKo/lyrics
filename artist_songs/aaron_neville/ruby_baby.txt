I have a girl and Ruby is her name
She don’t look at me but I love her just the same.

Ruby, ruby, how I want you,
Like a ghost I’m gonna haunt you
Ruby, Ruby, when will you be mine?

The next time I’ll see you
Give you my whole cries.
I’m gonna steal you away from all those guys.

From the Sunday, the day I met you,
I’ve been in bed, I’m gonna get you
Ruby, Ruby, when will you be mine?

I got a girl and Ruby is her name
And I need a girl just to set her hall of fame.

Got some other money, too
I’m gonna give it all of you
Ruby, Ruby, when will you be mine?
Ruby, Ruby, when will you be mine?
Ruby, Ruby, when will you be mine?
