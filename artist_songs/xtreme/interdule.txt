Listen girl

I shouldn't never do wut I did
That's why I'm here on my knees
To tell you

I'm sorry if I dare you wrong
I'm sorry I was there for u baby
And know I'm left alone

Let's do it again

I'm sorry for the stupid ways babe
I'm sorry if I dare you wrong
I'm sorry I was there for u baby
And know I'm left alone

Switch it up

That's all I ask u
But if u r still not convince
I got something else to say
