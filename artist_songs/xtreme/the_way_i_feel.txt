I saw this girl, she caught my eyes.
I need to know was it her lips? was it her smile?. 
Or even the sexy ways that she looked at me. 
ohh soo sweet. I wish I that could have her next to me.

If you see this girl, yeah. 
Beautiful smile lovely style wonderful, kind, just about what I want. 
Ohh way just changed my world. 
More than that, just be the last, just the one that I want for me. 

Would you tell her if you see her walking by, the way I feel.
Would you tell her if you see her at the mall, the way I feel. 
Would you tell her if you see her looking lonely, the way I feel.
Would you tell her even though you don’t know her, the way I feel.

I hope that I see her again
But this time I won’t think twice I will say hi, 
And also ask what’s her name? and how she’s  been 
Ever since the sunny Friday afternoon 

If I ever get the change to…
Talk to her let her know what’s really going on 
But the possibility seems so hard, 
There is almost nothing I can do but any ways..

Would you tell her if you see her walking by, the way I feel.
Would you tell her if you see her at the mall, the way I feel. 
Would you tell her if you see her looking lonely, the way I feel.
Would you tell her even though you don’t know her, the way I feel.

Can this be love at first sight? Someone tell me why?

Would you tell her if you see her walking by(walking by), the way I feel.(would to you tell her, ohh, ohh.)
Would you tell her if you see her at the mall (at the mall just shopping), the way I feel. 
Would you tell her if you see her looking lonely (looking lonely, Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely) the way I feel.
Would you tell her even though you don’t know her, the way I feel.
