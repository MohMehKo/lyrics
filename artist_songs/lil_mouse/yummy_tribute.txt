Ion' know about your city, but mine got hitters
And all the hitters started from lil niggas
Gotta get a band, quick to get paid
Yummy is a hitter, I know around my age
9mm, I don't fuck around
Chopper stand tall, don't get gunned down
Ask you what you' claiming if you ain't 7-4 hit you in your face
Cock it back and let it blow
Got the 30 clip, make it disappear like a magic trick
As if y'all a bitch, you think I ain't drillin' y'all dummys
Nigga this a message R.I.P Lil Yummy

Yummy was a hitter, push a nigga shit back
Gutta' in my blood, leave a nigga laying flat
40 in my hand, Lil Mouse I'm taking lives
If you fuck around, your life flash before your eyes
I'm a real nigga, keep it on me never lacking
All my niggas rollin' kill a nigga Back to trapping
R.I.P Lil Yummy 107 where he posted
Man he was a hitter, choppers down choppers rolling
7-4 I'm banging, don't get hit Osama style
GDN I'm claiming lil niggas goin' wild
50 shot Tec, 40 piece and 40 blowin'
Disrespect my niggas, 30 clip yea bitch I'm blowing
