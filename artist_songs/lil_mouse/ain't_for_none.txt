All my niggas ain't for none and they love playing with drums
Take down gang! We make em run (gang gang)
Can't compare them niggas bum
Its hollows in that drum
Countin 50's ain't no 1's
Too much gucci need a lung
Gucci smellin like a skunk

All my niggas ain't for none and they love playing with drums
Take down gang! We make em run (gang gang)

Gucci smellin like a skunk

[D Money:]

For my brother beat his face
Acting tough you get erased
Don't get smoked I keep the K

[Sample from "Home Alone" movie:]
I'm gonna give you to the count of 10
To get your ugly, yellow
No good keister off my property
Before I pump your guts full of led
(Alright Johnny I'm Sorry, I'm going)
1 2 10
[Gun fire]
