Hear some voices in my head they telling me get money
Designer all I rock got some shoes for like 800
Diamonds on my wrist and my pcoket got all hundreds
I'm pulling off in drop tops I'm felxing I love stunting
Now they wanna hate on me cause my pockets got hundreds
Now they wanna hate on me cause they can't get no money
Now they wanna hate on me don't hate on me get money
Now they wanna hate on me I do this for my homie

Designer all I rock caught me flexing I love stunting
Pockets full of hundreds I'm thumbing through blowing hundreds
I started out my day, with a bag of money
You can't take it from me don't get close up on me
I'm with a whole lot of demons they come clap you up
It ain't safe where I'm from can't be lacking bruh
Cause I got shorties they widling they'll wet you up
I can't trust a soul they be switching up
You ain't from my land you can't hang with us
Jacksons and franklins I be counting up
Designer all I rock I be fresh as fuck
Walk around the hood with my ruger tucked
(Don't try your luck)

Hear some voices in my head they telling me get money
Designer all I rock got some shoes for like 800
Diamonds on my wrist and my pcoket got all hundreds
I'm pulling off in drop tops I'm felxing I love stunting
Now they wanna hate on me cause my pockets got hundreds
Now they wanna hate on me cause they can't get no money
Now they wanna hate on me don't hate on me get money
Now they wanna hate on me I do this for my homie

Lady ask me why my pants sagging I'm tryna hold these bands
Talking shit them shooters at your do' like its the pizza man
VVS's in my watch can't tell the time its blinging
Pulled up to the party with a 4 and a 2 liter
Sneak dissing on me I'll have my brother leave ya stinking
Thirty three up in the nina all black could hardly see ya
And I got a forty with a beam man
Call fatz ma he aiming and squeezing
Pulled off in a foreign now she cheesing
When I pulled up on she couldn't belive it
All this ice got me cold like anemic
Do the dash in my rari where I'm leaning

Hear some voices in my head they telling me get money
Designer all I rock got some shoes for like 800
Diamonds on my wrist and my pcoket got all hundreds
I'm pulling off in drop tops I'm felxing I love stunting
Now they wanna hate on me cause my pockets got hundreds
Now they wanna hate on me cause they can't get no money
Now they wanna hate on me don't hate on me get money
Now they wanna hate on me I do this for my homie
