(My shoes bloody, spent $2, 000, I'm stunting and my pocket full of money, run up on me leave you bloody)

I just left the store, my shoes bloody
Spent $2, 000 on my kicks, the bottom bloody
My double cup is muddy, I love stunting
Pocket fulla hundreds I be thumbing
My shoes bloody, spent $2, 000, I'm stunting and my pocket full of money, run up on me leave you bloody
My shoes bloody, spent $2, 000, I'm stunting and my pocket full of money, run up on me leave you bloody

My double cup is muddy, I love stunting
Blue hundreds in my pocket, I be thumbing
Ride down yo block, them niggas running
And I'm always with them demons, they on dummy
Milly got the Mac, I don't think he really wanna beef with me
Them shooters ready and them shooters shoot for me
Soon as the body drop, them niggas telling, they can't beef with me
Always in designer clothes, fresh as fuck, you know it's me
Bottom of my bloody, that's why she on me
In a drop-top Porsche, them bitches want me
Ain't no squares in my circle, can't fuck with phonies
Catch a opp in my hood, them killas on him

I just left the store, my shoes bloody
Spent $2, 000 on my kicks, the bottom bloody
My double cup is muddy, I love stunting
Pocket fulla hundreds I be thumbing
My shoes bloody, spent $2, 000, I'm stunting and my pocket full of money, run up on me leave you bloody
My shoes bloody, spent $2, 000, I'm stunting and my pocket full of money, run up on me leave you bloody

Riding through your hood in a Range Rover
Everytime I got a show them bitches know us
Double cup with lean, I stay poured up
Acting like you gang, you don't know us
Since I'm hot, everybody want a verse from me
My diamonds dancing, everywhere I go they notice me
Y'all broke, pockets flat, it's an emergency
Ya'll crazy, y'all ain't getting no money, y'all can't hate on me
When I'm riding, Meezy strapped, don't think about trying me
Last nigga, he got dropped, he tried to slide on me
Ram squeezing on that Ruger, right beside of me
We gone leave him, you die if you try on me

I just left the store, my shoes bloody
Spent $2, 000 on my kicks, the bottom bloody
My double cup is muddy, I love stunting
Pocket fulla hundreds I be thumbing
My shoes bloody, spent $2, 000, I'm stunting and pocket full of money, run up on me leave you bloody
My shoes bloody, spent $2, 000, I'm stunting and pocket full of money, run up on me leave you bloody
