Forget a way to see another day
Death of a good man
The time it takes, takes to see another day
Death of a good man
The time it takes, takes to see another day
Death of a good man
The time it takes, takes

Where I'm from it's real, better have your jewelry tucked
Got all these diamonds and I never got my jewelry took
30 stones on my wrist, Cartier
Don't believe nothin' you say, you a fake
Pull up in a white 'Rari, now she choosin'
You can't go back to your hood, boy you losin'
Been a lot of places, everywhere they notice me
Been in a lot situations you will never be
Say he the man in the city, don't believe that
My team all about the money, yeah we keep racks
I'm well known all around, it ain't no stoppin' that

Forget a way to see another day
Death of a good man
The time it takes, takes to see another day
Death of a good man
The time it takes, takes to see another day
Death of a good man
The time it takes, takes

I'm addicted to money, out here countin' these hundreds
They don't wanna get money, rather shoot at each other
In my own lane, can't relate to no other
Arenas on my feet when I'm out in the public
You can't conversate with me if you ain't talkin' 'bout money
Two thousand for my shoes and the bottom is bloody
This the life that I live, I ain't grindin' for nothin'

Forget a way to see another day
Death of a good man
The time it takes, takes to see another day
Death of a good man
The time it takes, takes to see another day
Death of a good man
The time it takes, takes

You either live by the gun or die by the gun
Yeah that's how the story goes
In the streets I'm a get it, on a money mission
Gettin' it on my own
Cause you ain't ever met another like me
By any means necessary, I'm a eat
They say the good die young, no not me

Forget a way to see another day
Death of a good man
The time it takes, takes to see another day
Death of a good man
The time it takes, takes to see another day
Death of a good man
The time it takes, takes
