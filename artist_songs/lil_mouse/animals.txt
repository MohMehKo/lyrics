You can't hang out with my squad we ride foreign cars
They know hella bandz them stars they know who we are
I don't got no love for her I'm an animal
I be posted on ermold all day with them animals

You ride through my hood yell at me its easy see that hammer blow
And when I pop out got that Glock up for whoever want it
My shooters looking for a body I don't think you want it
And all these niggas snitching that's why the police up on us
And all these haters pocket watchers go and get some money
Your girlfriend on my dick I let her fuck my partna
My partna he got pockets filled with money we balling
My foreign got them forgis on got these bitches crawling
I got the whole gang with me when I'm at a show
Pull up flexing for these hoes all these bitches go
Shining cause my wrist on froze and my pockets swole
I swear you don't want no smoke you don't want no smoke
Benz coupe full of smoke dutchies full of dope
Money it can't fold I can't trust a soul
Watch out for them folks lil folks he lay low
Marley he keep pole he gon let it blow
Its so crazy I'm the man at a young age
Everytime I hit the stage bitches scream my name
Everytime I'm in that rari I be switching lanes
Got a bad bitch in my rari dick all on her brain
And when I step out they get blinded cause my diamonds bling
Crystal over till my feet, in that fellow thing
Call me jordan the way I'm balling like I got a ring
Ball in heaven Gunna for him I'm gon do my thing
