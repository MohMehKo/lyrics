On that meek milly shit
Go pop a wheelie shit
Got my money counter
Don't like counting shit

Filthy money on me girl I'm filthy rich
That bitch she stole my clothes
On that meek milly shit go pop a wheelie shit
I do not trust my bitch she on some silly shit
Filthy money on me I'm still counting it
I got my money counter don't like counting shit
We packing extra guns we don't pack extra clips
I'm on some builder shit come thru and hammer shit

Come thru' and hammer shit, your block can't handle it
Folknem be nailing shit, and they straight felons bitch
Me and Ben Franklin cool we on some chillin shit
My bitch hate that we close she on some jealous shit
If I get in that jam than I'm not telling shit
If a nigga snitch on us than we go nail that bitch
My jeweler do his thing I brought my jewerly out
Nun' but diamonds in this mansion
This the jewelry house
Hollows popping out they hot, I brought the heater out
Ridin' with them shooters, brought them demons out
Fresher than a bitch I brought the cleaners out
Pulled up in a steamer let them killas out

Filthy money on me girl I'm filthy rich
That bitch she stole my clothes
On that meek milly shit go pop a wheelie shit
I do not trust my bitch she on some silly shit
Filthy money on me I'm still counting it
I got my money counter don't like counting shit
We packing extra guns we don't pack extra clips
I'm on some builder shit come thru and hammer shit

Looking for me hard to find, I'm not hard to find
If we play, we have your body, you gone be hard to find
Time is money, I'm on time, you just wasting time
I sent some soldiers to your house
You not that hard to find
Suicide killas', they don't have no problem dying
I'm finna' take a trip, and I don't have no problem flying
I know some people that's gone, die for me, ride for me
Don't put your life on the line thinking mouse a dummy
When I get the millions please don't ask Lil Mouse for nothing
I'm just gone count these thousands
You mad cause you can't count nothing
I'm gone be chasing money if, I'm gone be chasing something
I used to be broke so, all that hate for nothing

Filthy money on me girl I'm filthy rich (Filthy Rich)
That bitch she stole my clothes (dumb lil' filthy bitch)
On that meek milly shit go pop a wheelie shit
I do not trust my bitch she on some silly shit
Filthy money on me I'm still counting it
I got my money counter don't like counting shit
We packing extra guns we don't pack extra clips
I'm on some builder shit, come thru and hammer shit
