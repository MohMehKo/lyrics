Ballin like I'm in the gym
Dem bitches know who I am
I'm Dunkin I ain't talking Tim
I'm shooting I don't need a rim
Diamonds on my robins, horse shoes on my trues
Disrespect my squad, then you gonna meet the tool
Buck the gun dem niggas run
Shoot the gun dem niggas duck
I shoot like Doc Divers son
I shoot like Doc Divers son
My Team shoot like a sentry gun
Them niggas sweet like honey buns
40 make a dummy run
Choppa' leave a dummy slumped

Leave him closed casket
Playing with my killers
I'm a keep your mans for ransom
I'm taking off, I'm taking off
Your bitch see me she take it offf
Ballin like I'm John Wall
I keep clips like Chris Paul
30 knock your shit off
Choppa' make em criss cross
Corlay World, Gunna City
All my niggas riding with me
Sending shots no cameraman
Reckless how this hammer blam
Hitters in the mini van
Calling hits like uncle Sam
Balling like the NBA
Been balling since the second grade
Listen how this uzi spray
I'm Bandin' I don't need a raise
Them niggas they want me dead
Cause I'm young and breakin bread
Like a penny I want head
Gotta look out for the feds
Them niggas shoot they aim for legs
My niggas shoot they aim for head
Body count, body count
I'm shooting like Afghanistan
Tec' heavy load on the hip
You move wrong he blow your shit
Throwin bullets like Michael Vick
Dem niggas mad cause I'm the shit
Shawty on my dick
Because she know a nigga keep it real
Gotta keep that 40 close
Cause ain't no lacking in the field
Ain't no lacking in the field
If you lacking you get killed
Man I gotta alot hitters
That will pop you like a pill
Free all of my hittas at that jail
That's doin time
If you heard something bout me
Don't believe them cause they lying
They Wanna put dirt on my name
Wanna end a nigga fame
First nigga run up
First nigga getting changed
Leave em slump
Put em in a dumpster if he actin up
Run up on him with that 30
Bet that that gon' bitch him up
Leave em slump
Put em in a dumpster if he actin up
Run up on him with that 30
Bet that that gon' bitch him up

Hella Bandz, Let's get it!
Shotter up man

Shawty' wanna blow me
But keep it on the low key
Poke em if he holding
My nigga Shotta' rollin'
For my squad I'm wacking shit

Playing with my money
That's gonna get your body missing quick

Rob a nigga for his brick
Shooting like I'm Jr Smith
Balling like I'm Jermey Lin
Swish
