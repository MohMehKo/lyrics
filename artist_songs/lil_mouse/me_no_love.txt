[Chris James:]
She say she fell in love
But a nigga like me don't love
She wanna share a bottle
But a nigga like me don't love
She say she feel me
But a nigga like me don't love
But a nigga like me don't love
Me no love, tell her me no love
Me no love, tell her me no love
Me no love, tell her me no love
Me no love, tell her me no love

[Lil Mouse:]
I'd never wife a thot
Nigga like me don't need no love
Robbing kid's they full of nuts
She on me when I'm in the club
Poppin' bottles I'm a star
They know Lil Mouse got that bub
And your girlfriend she's a fan
Wanna take pictures and want a hug
Paparazzi taking pictures
Of Lil Mouse cause I'm so swag
In the mall with my cash
I be ballin' like the Mavs
Hit the lot with a bag
Copped a Rari and a Jag
I'm on top, these niggas mad
Throwing money, I'm getting cash
She all on me and my squad
Cause our chain got all this ice
VBS is in my chain
Try to take it, that's your life
Bought a crib, got a maid
Me and my bands, I don't need no wife
Trynna get my hittaz, out the hood
And get this money cause that's the life
Got a benz, off the lot
Got some 4's, and paint it white
In the club, diamonds shining
It's so bright, you don't need a light
Got a booth of the act
Hit the store, and bought a sprite
We don't need a girl, she wanna get cuffed
That ain't my type

[Lil Mouse:]
She say she wanna be the one
She wanna get cuffed, she see that bag
I got diamonds on my chain, and my pants
I'm super swag
Call me Rudy, with that Uzi
Try to run, and you get tagged
All this gold in my jewellery, I ain't talkin' Trinidad
Call me Harden with that Rocket
In my pockets, It's them bands
Me and Chris, don't love these thotties
We just pass her to our mans
If you try me, call my hitters
They come get you in a van
And these girls all on me
Cause they know that I'm the man
If the colors foreign
I be pullin up in different whips
They be jockin hard
Cause they see me in that foreign whip
In the trap house, errday
Water woopin bricks
If you lookin' for me, I'm in the hood
On my hood shit
Got a benz, off the lot
Got some 4's, and paint it white
In the club, diamonds shinin'
It's so bright, you don't need no light
Got a booth, of the act
Hit the store, and bought a sprite
We don't need a girl, she wanna get cuffed
That ain't my type
