Walk up in da club
Dirty spark my double cup
G popping bottles and D Money rolling up
Pourin' all this lean I'm so tired of pouring up
Get her to the crib that little bitch gonna let me fuck

Smoking all the ounces, So dutchy's I'm rolling up
Niggas talking shit but get popped when we rolling up
Body's hit the floor, Body's drop when we running up
Can't treat you like my brother nigga you not one of us
Talking all that shit then my big brother gonna let it bust
Smoking all this dope I fill like gucci in a blunt, yeah
My diamonds glimming bitch, I shine just like the sun
Five, Four, Three, Two bitch I am the one
Yeah, my bro a shooter bitch he Kobe in the cut
Yeah I'm smoking fred stuffed his body in blunt
Laughing at the oops cause when they see us man they run
Automatic guns bitch that glizzy metal drum
Back to the money they say I'm a walking bank
All these presidents I keep these hundreds locked up safe
Shout out to my jeweler diamonds blinging in they face
Creases in my feet I walk up bleeding in the place
And I'm getting money that's the life of a young boss
Can't hold a conversation so I let my money talk
Mace's on my feet bitch that's $2, 000 when I walk
Diving in designer so little bitch I'm dripping sauce

Walk up in da club
Dirty spark my double cup
G popping bottles and D Money rolling up
Pour all this lean I'm so tired of pouring up
Get her to the crib that little bitch gonna let me fuck
