My diamonds they dancing, my chains cost a mansion

She know me, she on me, she want me, she going
She know that I'm rolling with hella bands

My money is stacked up in rubber bands

I tell them that I'm balling like Jeremy Lin
My shoes is Gucci, your girlfriend a groupie
My cars are colored [?]
My youngins they wilding, all about action
