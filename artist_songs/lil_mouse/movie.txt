I love this life I live, I can't stop living this life
Don't need no [?] when I'm around, that's why my diamonds bright

I love this life I live, I can't stop living this life
I know some people that'll kill just to live this life
Don't need no [?] when I'm around, that's why my diamonds bright
I'm turning up like no tomorrow, I'm going hard tonight
It found me first, I can't pin nobody above them
He mad cause I got all this money, I'm above him
He said that he getting money, I can't believe that
I'm doing shows all around the world, yeah, my pockets fat
Big house in Atlanta, that's where I chill at
I'm from the outside of south side Chicago where it's real at
They show me love everywhere, I know I'm good there
And if you wanna know about me I'm a let you know

My life is a movie, moving too fast
We be steady moving, pedal to the gas
So girl, don't worry about nothing, I got you bad
So don't worry about nothing, I got you bad
Hustling all day and right, trying to get my paper right
So I love living life and I won't stop for nothing

I've seen a lot at this age, I love living this life
I'm blowing up, no grenade, my neck is covered with ice
I'm always fresher than him, my money taller than his
And I every time I go out I pull up in an M6
I'm the life of the party, ain't no other like me
You can't get on my level, my flow 100 degrees
I'm taking trips overseas, it's just me and my brother
I'm always stacking these hundreds so I can take care of my mother
I'm the best of 'em all, they can't do what I do
My life is a movie, I'm moving fast, I'm flexing on you
Designer belt match my shoes, all these Franklins and Jacksons
All this money I'm stacking, getting money a habit

My life is a movie, moving too fast
We be steady moving, pedal to the gas
So girl, don't worry about nothing, I got you bad
So don't worry about nothing, I got you bad
Hustling all day and right, trying to get my paper right
So I love living life and I won't stop for nothing
