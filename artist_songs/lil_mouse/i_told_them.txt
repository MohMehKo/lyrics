I told my mama I'm a give it all I got
I told my team that we gon' take it to the top
Instead of sittin' on the corner sellin' rocks
I'm in the foreign bendin' corners on the block
I told my mama I'm a give it all I got
I told my team that we gon' take it to the top
Instead of sittin' on the corner sellin' rocks
I'm in the foreign bendin' corners on the block
That's what I told 'em
And you ain't gotta believe me, but my nigga
That's what I told 'em
And you ain't gotta believe me, but my nigga
That's what I told 'em
And you ain't gotta believe me, but my nigga
That's what I told 'em, that's what I told 'em
That's what I told 'em

I told people I'm a make it, man they told me I'm a lie
They gon' hate on me, I don't think they really want me to shine
I'm a youngin' goin' crazy, boy, all I know is grind
Gettin' money in my blood, get that from my mama's side
I told [?] we gon' make it, they don't want us at the top
Man we started from the bottom, now we're grindin' to the top
Told my brother I'm a make it, he know I'm a be a star
Told my mama I'm a make it, I'm a give it all I got
I can't switch up for nobody, I'm a always be the same
I ain't like these other people, boy I'm in another lane
You don't know me, move around, wanna hang out cause of fame
Everybody want a picture with me cause they know my name

I told my mama I'm a give it all I got
I told my team that we gon' take it to the top
Instead of sittin' on the corner sellin' rocks
I'm in the foreign bendin' corners on the block
I told my mama I'm a give it all I got
I told my team that we gon' take it to the top
Instead of sittin' on the corner sellin' rocks
I'm in the foreign bendin' corners on the block
That's what I told 'em
And you ain't gotta believe me, but my nigga
That's what I told 'em
And you ain't gotta believe me, but my nigga
That's what I told 'em
And you ain't gotta believe me, but my nigga
That's what I told 'em, that's what I told 'em
That's what I told 'em

I told my mama I'm a give it all I got
I told my team that we gon' take it to the top
Instead of sittin' on the corner sellin' rocks
I'm in the foreign bendin' corners on the block
I told my mama I'm a give it all I got
I told my team that we gon' take it to the top
Instead of sittin' on the corner sellin' rocks
I'm in the foreign bendin' corners on the block
That's what I told 'em
And you ain't gotta believe me, but my nigga
That's what I told 'em
And you ain't gotta believe me, but my nigga
That's what I told 'em
And you ain't gotta believe me, but my nigga
That's what I told 'em, that's what I told 'em
