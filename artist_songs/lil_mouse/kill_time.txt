I'm just letting you know how it is...
Hellabandz...
It's kill time

I'm a show you who the drillers is
Why you drill rappin' you ain't from here
Tired of niggas tryna be like us tryna drill rap you can't come here
Deep shit with hollow tips and a drum on it we tote those
Fake gangster tryna drill rap
I'm a call 'em thug, we expose those
That don't mean you a drill rapper cause you
Got a 30 shot with a beam
These days niggas characters finna shoot a movie put 'em in a scene
You diss all the niggas from here
Real talk, they ain't on shit
Nigga tryna get street credit
You real G's catch 'em get the whole clip
I'm a show you how to drill time
My brothers slide when it's kill time
Gotta meet the plug in a couple hours
Gonna Catch a body just to kill time
Pockets fat but I still grind
Bitch give me brain she got good mind
Everybody know 11/9 Posted up on parole and he still slide
I be ridin' in the foreign whips
Couple loose screws and a pipe tucked
Where you from, never heard of you
I ain't know they had killing out there
On the 9 we be out there
Posted with the guys, I be out there
Big poles, yeah they out here
We be slidin' past yeah we out there
Everybody wanna gangbang, wanna be cool tryna gangbang
Bitch up when that thang flame, in a foreign thang with yo main thang
Two seater blowin' propane
In a foreign whip, color cocaine
Bad bitch do cocaine
We don't fuck with 12, they don't know thangs
When I ride, I ride lowkey
Never let a nigga hold me
Never let a nigga pole me
Never talk to the police
This shit ain't no game
And this shit ain't no joke
Don't rap about it if you don't be around it
You gon' fuck around and get smoked...
