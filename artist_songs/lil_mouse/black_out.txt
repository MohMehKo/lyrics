Every time I come around, it's a black out
I be flexing, I be pulling racks out
And I'm staying around with the Mac's out
I'm on my drill shit, it's a black out

Every time I come around, it's a black out
I be flexing, I be pulling racks out
And I'm staying around with the Mac's out
I'm on my drill shit, it's a black out

Every time I come around, it's a black out
Do a hit, my shooters don't have, but them niggas back out
Call my shooters thunder, when they pull a Mac out
Cause my boy don't stop shooting, til yo body flat down
Run up in the spot, make the shooters lay down
All these niggas [?] when they hear the K sound
Flied in his block, and he hopping [?] now
Leaving scene, saying they saw his man's face down
I only want the top, tell her put her face down
I'm always gon' be first, feel like it's a race now
Dad be jocking, cause my pockets fat and I keep that K round
It's a black out
If he try to run, and I'm a blow his back out
Go ahead 42, call it [?]
And ya know I'm hella bands, so ya know I brought the racks out

Every time I come around, it's a black out
I be flexing, I be pulling racks out
And I'm staying around with the Mac's out
I'm on my drill shit, it's a black out

Every time I come around, it's a black out
I be flexing, I be pulling racks out
And I'm staying around with the Mac's out
I'm on my drill shit, it's a black out

All that woofing shit, pull up on you broad day
Keep that burner with me, in brod day
Couple hitters with me, and they shooting broad day
It's a black out when I come around, the guns aye
Hit them all when I ryde by, [?]
All these drums in my squad, like a rock band
All these guns in my crib, nigga we not playing
Choppas can't fit on my waist, but I bet the Glock can
Dissing on a squad, have Millie come wack him
[?]
Looking for a opp, catch him then we clap him
If you riding then we catch up with the traffic
All my niggas trained to blow, they ain't missing
Talking reckless I'm a have you missing
In the kitchen, serving junkies like a waitress

Every time I come around, it's a black out
I be flexing, I be pulling racks out
And I'm staying around with the Mac's out
I'm on my drill shit, it's a black out

Every time I come around, it's a black out
I be flexing, I be pulling racks out
And I'm staying around with the Mac's out
I'm on my drill shit, it's a black out
