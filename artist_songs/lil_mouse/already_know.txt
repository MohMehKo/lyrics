I'm good in every hood, they fuck with me the long way
All these bands up in my pocket, let them drums play
They already know it, they already know it, they already know it
They already know it, they already know it, they already know it

I'm good in every hood, they fuck with me the long way
All these bands up in my pocket, let them drums play
They already know it, they already know it, they already know it
They already know it, they already know it, they already know it

I got a lot of respect, don't come to me incorrect
I do this all for my people, Balenciaga all black
I love my money, can't nobody tell me nothin' 'bout that
I'm in a two door with no top, pocket full of them racks
I'm different from other people, my team fly like an eagle
Can't compare me to them people, I'm so above all them people
They gon' hate on me, I know they wanna be in my spot
Hit the mall, spend it all, yeah I do that a lot
A lot of soldiers 'round me, I ain't by myself
Gold diamonds 'round my neck, I design myself
50 thousand in my pocket, I be cashin' out
I'm always stuntin', countin' money, you can ask around
