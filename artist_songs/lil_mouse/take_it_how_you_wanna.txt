Mouse, Hellabandz
You can take how you wanna...

You can take it how you wanna
You know I am the hottest
And I know that your man snitching
Cause he told on my partner
Ben Franklins and Jacksons all in my pocket
Feel like I'm a [?] from the thunder
And I'm a grizzly for my money, if its coming
Everytime that I'm in the booth
I be spitting hot like lava
My producer told me to step it up
He said I've been lacking on my rhymes
So I'm a drop this just to show um I'm poppin'
And ain't no talking if you run up then
My homies they poppin'
Hellabandz that's what I claim
Everybody they be jocking
Now you claiming another nigga gang
Boy you need to stop it
I'm the hottest up in the game
Like the middle of the summer
When they hear this they gon' be
Sneak dissing, take it how you wanna
I'm on the road, doing shows
Fucking hoes and counting comma
Let of that semi bullets eat you
So I call um, piranhas
I'm from the jungle where them gorillas
Will kill you for nothing and if you snitching
Show no mercy wrap you up like a mummy
I'm by myself, don't need niggas
I don't need no new homies, they be phony
I cut um off, so it's just me and money
Ain't shit funny, you run up on me
Then them choppas they drumming, call me parker
I keep that 9 on me thinking I'm Tony
Ever since I got the fame, all these bad bitches on me
But I don't do no rap beef, put them killers up on you
You say my name in a song, better say it correct
Cause if you don't, call shotta put that tec to your neck
They say they like how Lil Mouse ride
I ride different whips, stack my paper
Take a trip, then another trip
Lil bro he got 32 if you wanna trip
Drop a 6 up in my 20, that's a 26
And you gotta French a Move, I know that you fake
My squad we realist in it, ain't nobody fake
100 niggas in your circle, that's a hunnid snakes
100 niggas in my circle, they my a hunnid apes
GANG!
