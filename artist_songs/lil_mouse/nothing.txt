I can't find another mother like the one I've got
In that CL63 painted all black
She keep calling me, she keep asking me where I'm at
I'm getting money, ain't no other way around that
Flexing like a minute, yeah, I'm getting paper
All this money so I ball like Danny Granger
I really think this girl want me for my paper
I really think she wanna go out cause my Franklins
I'm a stunt so everybody gon' change
They gon' get mad cause they not in my lane
I wanna tell her she the one for me
Any other girls ain't nothing to me

I wanna tell you, I wanna tell you, I wanna tell you
That you the only one for me
I wanna tell you, I wanna tell you, I wanna tell you
These other women don't mean nothing to me
And anything is possible, yeah
If we overlook these obstacles
I wanna tell you, I wanna tell you, I wanna tell you
These other women don't mean nothing to me
