Bitch, I woke up in the trap, and went to buy me a new car
I put my life on the line, I'm a hood superstar
I go cray, go cray
I go cray, go cray
I go cray, go cray
I go cray, go cray

[Lil Mouse:]
I woke up in a coupe, went and bought me a 'Rari
Jimmy Choo on my shoes, won't catch me in no Pradas
I be living the life cause I can't live it twice
My little niggas they demons, wanna play "take your life"
All my diamonds they shining, 20k for my chains
Won't catch me in no trues, all my pairs Balmain
Pulling up in a Bentley, or pull up in a Range
All my soldiers insane, wanna play "blow your brain"
I woke up in the trap, 20 bands in my pocket
I feel like I'm from Houston, taking off like a rocket
Ain't no squares in my circle, keep the fake from around
We are always in the hood and we'll come to your town

Bitch, I woke up in the trap, and went to buy me a new car

I go cray, go cray
I go cray, go cray
I go cray, go cray
I go cray, go cray

[Lil Mouse:]
Pulling up in that foreign, pulling off with your bitch
All my clothes designer, 15000 a fit
You can't do what I do, you can't go where I go
Vellanos all on my car same color as snow
Presidents in my pocket, playing with it, so stop it
Lil Mouse, I'm the topic, I got everyone watching
Throwing bullets like Brady, pull up in a Mercedes
Dropped the top of my car, I like to stunt on these haters
I woke up in a Bentley, went and got me a Porsche
Pass Trigga the semi, he gon' blow up the Porsche
A lot of hitters is with me, they'll kick in your door
Tell you get on the floor, if you move they'll blow

Bitch, I woke up in the trap, and went to buy me a new car

I go cray, go cray
I go cray, go cray
I go cray, go cray
I go cray, go cray
