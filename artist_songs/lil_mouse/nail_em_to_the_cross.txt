I say fuck that little white boy, they think I'm racist
I say fuck that little white boy, they think I'm racist
I say fuck that little white boy, they think I'm racist

We gonna nail him to the cross, he say he Jesus
Fuck with the opps, and we gonna make him a believer
Say he cold till I touch him with the heater
I'm in that foreign, going faster then a cheetah
Niggas bums, they do anything for clout
We know where you be, so yella watch your mouth
He said he Jesus, time to nail him with the hammer
If we wanted to, we could've caught you in Atlanta
Moving slow, I pour a 4 inside a fanta
Riding round with 3 hoes, call me santa
Bitch these hollows hot as hell, call me Satan
Fuck that bitch like 2 or 3 times, she think we date
I say fuck that little white boy, they think I'm racist
I say fuck that little white boy, they think I'm racist
I say fuck that little white boy, they think I'm racist
Margelias on my feet, they call me mason
I don't think he on my level, yella basic
Switching lanes in that foreign, they think I'm racing
Just because we roll up swisher, think its sweet
Red bottoms, 15 hunnit on my feet
I'm a start at 15 thousand when I speak
Think we playing, lil folks smack him with the heat
We really about that action, think its a game
Shoutout to your bitch, and nutted on her face
Call ManMan, he so ready shoot his face
We got money, he ain't worried about a case
Twitter wolfing, and ain't gonna say it to my face
You think you lowkey, till we pop up at your place
I'm from the jungle nigga, I stay with them apes
Don't play with big folks, yella he just bought a K

Go crazy on these bum ass niggas
This the last time I'm doing this shit
Ion even rap beef, I just have 11-9 clap heat
Yeah, Gang
