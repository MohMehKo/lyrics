I fell in love with all this money, all this cash money
Got all this jewelry on me, this ain't even half of it
These haters wanna see me fall so I laugh at 'em
I'm in that Benz all white hitting that gas pedal
Catch me flexing in Detroit, I feel like Josh Smith
In New York balling hard like JR Smith
I'm going hard, boy, I'm tryna see a hundred mill
My bankroll got a lot of 50's, ain't no dollar bill
See, all these haters wanna be me, tell 'em follow me
I'm always dressed in designer, watch me in Versace jeans
The Louie fake, the diamonds fake, boy, ain't no fooling me
She know I'm Lil Mouse Hella Bandz, she wanna cool me
He say he getting money, well, he gotta show me
He get some money and go flexing, don't even feed his team
I can't switch up on my homies, they'll die for me
And I can't let anybody get that close to me

They be hating on me cause they knowing I get money
I'm a stunt cause they want me to fall
I'm a shine, it's my time, independent and I'm winning
I be flexing cause they want me to fall

They be hating on me cause they knowing I get money
I'm a stunt cause they want me to fall
I'm a shine, it's my time, independent and I'm winning
I be flexing cause they want me to fall

When I first started rapping whoever thought
That I'd be pulling up in foreigns with no top
That I'd be the man, now they hate cause I'm on top
They can't go where I go, they wanna be in my spot
I be iced out, got diamonds, chains and watch
They be hating on me because I became a star
I'm a keep it real and I can't change for nothing
They be acting fake and they be changing up
I be running to the money, I be racing
In a 2 Door Benz racing
You can't compare me to him, he basic
A lot of money in my pocket, Ben Franklin
All this money and this fame, it can't change nothing
Can't keep no new people around me, they'll change up
My cousin told me that my brother said the same stuff
All this money and this fame, they wanna hang with us

They be hating on me cause they knowing I get money
I'm a stunt cause they want me to fall
I'm a shine, it's my time, independent and I'm winning
I be flexing cause they want me to fall

They be hating on me cause they knowing I get money
I'm a stunt cause they want me to fall
I'm a shine, it's my time, independent and I'm winning
I be flexing cause they want me to fall
