Money stacked to the ceiling, I'm tryna stack me a million
Where I'm from, they be killing
All my homies gorillas, I know they mad cause I'm winning
Can't compare me, I'm different
Everybody know me, boy just like that I'm living
They wanna be me, they hating, got 50 thousand off that franklins
I don't do conversation, unless you talking about paper
I know they like that I'm shining, I know they mad cause they can't
I hit them all with the designer caption, out on everything
Try to cross me if you want boy, boy that's suicide
Pull up flexing, [?]
32 up in my clip, but I gave him 5
I'm from the hood, I was raised on 119

Presidential in my pocket, I'm tryna stack me a mill
They gon' hate cause I'm hard, all my diamonds is real
Ain't no fake up in my circle, all my killas real
Ain't no fake up in my circle, all my killas drill

A lot of money in my pocket, I got lots of commas
Only family and my ass, can't trust no others
No new faces up in my circle, just me and my brothas
I had to cut some people off, they working undercover
They know I'm a start, the fame came a lot been changed
They be on me cause my name made my diamonds bling
You could catch me switching lanes or I'm in the booth
20 bands up in my mans, [?]
Yo homies fake, so I can't walk with you
On the e way doing 100
I can't wear nothing plain, I wear designer shoes
Presidential up in my pocket, I been thumbing through

Presidential in my pocket, I'm tryna stack me a mill
They gon' hate cause I'm hard, all my diamonds is real
Ain't no fake up in my circle, all my killas real
Ain't no fake up in my circle, all my killas drill
