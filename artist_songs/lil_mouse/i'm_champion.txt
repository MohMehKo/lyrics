Shawty wanna ride with me cause I'm a champion
Gettin' money with my team, ain't no replacin' them
I lost my brother Gunna, man ain't no replacin' him
For him I'm goin' hard, gotta see these mils
Walk around, all these hundreds in my pocket
These haters mad I'm takin' off just like a rocket
Only designer so I shop at Neiman Marcus
When I pull up, here come paparazzis
They can't do what I do so they're watchin'
Her boyfriend wanna be me cause I'm icy
I walk around with all this money, now she like me

Shawty wanna leave with me because my wrist sick
My neck frozer than a freezer, I get sick quick
Dropped the top on that Vette, that's a foreign whip
Switchin' lane to lane in that M6
My team with me and we deep like it's a field trip
I'm in Atlanta, you know that I'm good here
In that CL550 with the big wheels
I'm always in a foreign, I don't sit still
I'm always up in traffic, I don't sit still
Ridin' 'round, I got all this Gucci on me
In that foreign, I got all this Louis on me
Shout out bag money boys, them my homies
