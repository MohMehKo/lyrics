Pull up in that foreign got his feelings hurt
Baby sweating hard, I ain't gotta work

Watch me pull up on-

Let's get it!

Drop top with the forty when I pull up on ya
Every car I got is foreign, pull up in that Rover
Hella Bandz but we worldwide, yeah they know us
Gotta lot of money, better watch how you approach us
All these diamonds in my watch, I can't tell the time
I'm Stevie Wonder to these haters I feel like I'm blind
Time is money, I'm getting money, so I ain't wasting time
When I pull up on you guaranteed to make you mad

Pull up in that foreign got his feelings hurt
Baby sweating hard, I ain't gotta work
All he gon' remember is them [?]
Then roll right in this city, hit the [?]

If I pull up in that black 'rari, she gon' leave with me
In that 458, I think I'm Spiderman
They ain't see me when I pulled off in that Spider, man
She wanna hang out with my squad cause we Hella Bandz
She know I'm Hella Bandz, know she wanna money dance

Pull up in that foreign got his feelings hurt
Baby sweating hard, I ain't gotta work
All he gon' remember is them [?]
