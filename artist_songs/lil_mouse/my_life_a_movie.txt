My life a movie just roll a tape

My life a movie just roll a tape

My life a movie bitch, my life a movie

My life a movie

My niggas shooting
Them Bitches choosing (thot)
My trap house booming
Whip coat like scooter (skrrt)
If we don't catch him
We get somebody close to em'
My rode it's shooting
Cashed out I'm Gucci
Bullets stick to him
Get a check, going thru it
Bounce back like booming
Pockets fat like a tumor
Sound broke that's a rumor
Shout out to my jeweler
Yeh' bitch I'm flexin
Yeh bitch I'm wreckless
Pocketz full in my jackets
Fade shotguns catch'em
Man down told 10 in
Got bandz I'm flexin
Switch lanes didn't ask ya
Niggas mad I'm a banda

Switch lanes in that foregin
Catch up ya borin'

For them bandz to get wet
See a bully to get wet
Ridin' round with dat tech
Grand hood is my set
Super mill get a bet
Cut a mill on my jet
Cut a mill on my neck
Cut a mill in that vet
Top Shotta keep it lonely
Turn ya bitch to a runner
Cut towns in rover
Cristel shoes with dat roller
Throwin' bullets mike vick
Rob a nigga for a brick
Burnell watch on my wrist
Call scissors you it
