Bandz in my Jeans I'm a walking bank
5000 in one pocket I'm a walking stain
You won't try it cause them shooters with me love to bang
They so in love with that shit
I'm so in love with this shit

Diamonds they dancing and shit
50s and 100s on wrist
You can't compare me to them
Ball mane I'm flexing on them
He so in love with that bitch
Why he keep wife'n that bitch?

I told him he not on my level don't forget
My lil partna bought a Glock with two extra clips
I just pass him them two clips so that's my assist
And every time I go out I'm probably with yo bitch
She so in love with this dick
I anit got no love for his bitch
Look at the flick of my wrist
Look at the ass on his bitch
Look at the wheels on my whip
Now watch me pull off in that whip
Surrounded my niggas who kill
My diamonds cold I got chills
On the south-side of Chicago where its straight homicides
So if you not from here then don't come if you don't wanna die
Rolling ponny out the pound so my lungs fried
So many demons in my squad that ya'll terrified

Designer all on me I'm fresh
I ball like I'm Kobe I'm next
I pull off in raris and vets
My life is a movie I'm blessed
You niggas gone give me respect
My shooters they aiming at heads
They savage they coming with techs
I'm rich I'm thumbing through racks
Look at this ice on my neck
Look at this clip in my mac
Watch how that K hit his back
Got hollows that's ripping through vest
They know that lil mouse he the best
Why he keep wife'n that bitch?
This ice on my neck got me sick
I'm flexing they know I'm the shit

In the club ace of spades they bring it my way
My big cousin beat his case snitches stay away
We gone turn up everyday fuck what niggas say
Throwing 50s out the sun roof on a rainy day
Don't walk up on me like a pee-on I am not a lame
What they call it faneto? I'm finna hit a stain
Ice on like I'm sub zero shout out my diamond chain
In the two seat big body Rolls Royce I'm switching lanes
Yo boyfriend basic he can't be me he a fucking lame
My shorties ready they shooting run up and you get changed
You say your diamonds shining but to me they looking strange
Its crazy how niggas be snitching on they fucking gang (fucking goofys)
