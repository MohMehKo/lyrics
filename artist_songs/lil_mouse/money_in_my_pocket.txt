They can't stop me so they watch it
Time tickin so I'm clockin

With over 100, 000 veiws
I keep it cool so don't get schooled
Ride round with that tool
Better think before you make a move
Yo team gone be on the news
I'm in my lane stay in yo lane
Like a 30 you could get chained
If yo conversation ain't about money
Than please don't say my name
Stay in yo lane cause you a lame
Ain't eatin ion play games

Lames
Mess around with them mess arounds and you mess around and get smoked

So step back or get blowed
Better do what you been told
