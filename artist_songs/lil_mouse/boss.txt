Pocket full of money, this what bosses do
I'm Live from the trap house, this my office too
In Miami run it back, just like the dolphins do
I put some shoes on my Benz, call that the walking coupe
If you don't let me fuck it ain't no stalkin' you
I ain't that typa nigga, I can't keep callin' you
They wanna see me fall, I'm just gon fall on you
I throw this money up, its raining all on you
Pockets full of hunnids I like big face
And I keep watered diamonds like ah fish tank
And she say " I ain't shit " that's what my bitch thank
And ion't have no problems so I sip drank
He think that he the shit he got my old hoe
Don't make me get that range and grab yo main hoe
My diamonds fruit-a-loop look like a rainbow
I'm looking like ah lic, I ain't no stain doe
Smoking Gucci out the oz when I ride by
I got lil Man Man with me they think its a drive by
We poppin' xans and smokin' earth you know the guys high
Watch what you say to me don't make the nine slide
It don't take that much to pop up at a nigga house
Glock 40. with a 50. put it in his mouth
And we take down gang taking bitches down
She saying "shit don't make no sense" I put it in ha mouth
I feel like the Warriors I'm ballin'
I feel like the bulls bitch I'm Jordan
She wanna hang around with me to record it
I told ha we gon fuck and I record it
Pockets heavy bitch I'm icy I'm a boss
She see my jewelry girl don't ask how much it cost
I really see why niggas hatin' cause they lost
Don't make us pull up on yo block and let it off
I got a bitch she super savage set it off
I'm in the trap like I know magic get it gon
And everybody in here blinded cause my stones
I'm in the stu I'm smoking Gu don't call my phone
I feel like curry at the 3 I'm in my zone
All my niggas ain't no rappers they be trappin'
All my niggas bout that action they be clappin'
And everything I say is real I ain't just rappin'
And I got shooters in yo bushes yeah they campin'
Ain't talkin' nicks we keep them sticks we shoot them cannons
Say I'm a walk in like I'm shinnin' diamonds dancin'
Bitch you just fuck me I ain't tryna be romantic
