Trappin out the vacant if u holding we'll take it
I'm a young nigga shining so you know I'm gonna make it
My team HellaBandz and we ballin like the Lakers
The niggas that be stationed they be snitchin round yo station
In the hood gettin paper in my hood ain't no faking
I keep my circle closed cause these niggas they be snaking
The 9 ain't safe boy its hard for you to make it
My niggas super savage if you run they'll chase you

You know I'm hot bitch I'm on top
Cop the foreign and drop the top
Hit the mall buy Trues and rocks
We on the block with K's and Gloc's
The money come and niggas change
Bitches jock because the fame
They wanna fuck because my name
Before this shit it wasn't the same

Dissin on the squad if we catch you than we smoke ya
30s in the neiman nun but hollows and we toast em
And I'm tryna see a 100 mill before I grow up
Killers in yo house leave your brains on the sofa
Gunna city crazy and my team full of soldiers
Double cup of lean in the party and I'm poled up
Straight codeine so you know a nigga slowed up
20 for my chain 100k for my Rover
If a nigga talking like he tough than we fold him
Ball like the girl so you know she never sober
Hitters they'll kill they'll slump a nigga over
And they tryna blow they be blowin like the cover
Folks in the club off the henn and he rollin
Catch him with a bag and my niggas gonna poke him
Choppa get the sprayin hit his chest leave him soakin
All the double wallets all my niggas they be posted
