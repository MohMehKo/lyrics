[Lil Mouse:]
Shooters on deck, boy it's lights out
In the club, cameras bright, cut the lights out
Feel like Hoodrich with all this ice out
Catch an opp while we're ridin' then it's lights out
Shooters on deck, boy it's lights out
In the club, cameras bright, cut the lights out
Feel like Hoodrich with all this ice out
Catch an opp while we're ridin' then it's lights out

I feel like Hoodrich with all this ice out
Run up on you broad day with the pipes out
In the club, diamonds shinin', cut the lights out
A homicide on your block, boy it's lights out
I be flexin' on these niggas with my Glock out
All these bitches wanna jock so these knots out
Free Ebone, when he come home we bring the block out
And all these bitches want the squad, bring the thots out
Talkin' shit, I got a hundred in the Glock now
He Forrest Gump and that boy runnin' when them shots fire
Hollow tip make him dip, leave his brains fried
I got them hitters from the low end but I'm from the 9

Shooters on deck, boy it's lights out
In the club, cameras bright, cut the lights out
Feel like Hoodrich with all this ice out
Catch an opp while we're ridin' then it's lights out
Shooters on deck, boy it's lights out
In the club, cameras bright, cut the lights out
Feel like Hoodrich with all this ice out
Catch an opp while we're ridin' then it's lights out

[Top Shotta:]
Hundred goons with me, they'll knock your lights out
Put that burner in his mouth and make him pipe down
When Hoodrich get a bond he gon' be right out
When I hit the block, foes got them pipes out
Don't ride down Emerald with them lights out
Bullet hit your head, nigga, then it's lights out
Me and [?] hit up Saks and swipe their lights out
Hundred niggas, hundred guns, now that's a wipeout
Mouse be in the hood with all his ice out
And them shooters all around him with them pipes out
Mouse be in the hood with all his ice out
And them shooters all around him with them pipes out

[Lil Mouse:]
Shooters on deck, boy it's lights out
In the club, cameras bright, cut the lights out
Feel like Hoodrich with all this ice out
Catch an opp while we're ridin' then it's lights out
Shooters on deck, boy it's lights out
In the club, cameras bright, cut the lights out
Feel like Hoodrich with all this ice out
Catch an opp while we're ridin' then it's lights out
