What you want to know?
I'm a let you know
I be getting dough
Can't go back to broke
(I can't go back to broke)
Lean what I pour
So I'm moving slow
(It got me moving slow)
I am not no stain
Just not one of those
(Not one of those)
You not getting dough
You feel like a hoe
{Mouse}
Even when I was broke
{Let's get it}
I wasn't sharing clothes
You be pulling dueces
I might drop or fold
{I might drop or fold}
Even when I was broke
I wasn't sharing clothes

Even when I was broke
I wasn't sharing clothes
(No I wasn't sharing clothes)
Now I'm getting dough
I could drop or fold
(I just might drop or fold)
She know I got rolls
I could fuck your hoe
(I could fuck your hoe)
Rolling out the o's
Smelling all my clothes
(Guuci)
Designer on my feet
You can't see my toes
(No you can't see my toes)
Yo gang hit a party
I ain't see no hoes
(Y'all ain't got no hoes)
I hop up in my rari
I don't want no doors
(No I don't want no doors)
Riding with my poll
And I'm with my woes
(And I'm with the gang)
I am not no hoe
So why should I go?
(Why should I go?)
Coming out that coat
Jigga got that pull
(Jigga got that 40)
Telling all your folks
I know you a hoe
(You know you a hoe)
Even when I was broke
I wasn't sharing clothes
(I wasn't sharing clothes)
