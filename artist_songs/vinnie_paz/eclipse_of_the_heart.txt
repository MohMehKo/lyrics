Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit lonely
And you're never coming around
(Yeah, Yo, Huh... small real life man more real love)
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a little bit tired
Of listening to the sound of my tears
(That's all we got man, that's all we need yo straight maintainin)

Yo I must be the most valuable playa in this game of life
The way I claim my name is like yo but I'm just tryin to maintain baby
These people think I'm flaws but for real yo my mind is lost
I could spill my heart out right now but yo would it be worth it cause
I got what I need so I'm giving back I'm not a taker
And no longer to soon cause we gettin paper can ya'll feel that?
Time flys fast but I got to feel my ground
Cause nothin hurts you more than when your best friend is lettin you down
Finally I understand we're from heaven my dogs by my side
When my man got accepted by college I almost cried man
They never lie to me have pictures while I was on the side line
We all had the same dreams of watching each other shine
But it was the ones who knew me as I am when I just needed a hug
Thinkin I would live in a better place if I just spread some more love
Space is not an obstacle I feel you closer when we're apart
My peoples forever in my heart stand by my side when it's getting lost

Turnaround, every now and then I get a
Little bit lonely and you're never coming around
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a
Little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears

Ay yo I'm turnin around every fuckin step I take burns to ground
It ain't that hard to see that I'm the one whos hurtin now
I'm to cursed to plow motha fuckas wanna see me underground
But when I'm walkin on the path but I'm searchin for the crown
Bring it to heart this shits complicated ain't no nobody can get the picture
I ain't gettin richer but motha fuckas be playa hatin what's the deal?
4-8 soldier blessed with skills
The rest will fill this fucked up shit that stresses me when I need to kill a man
Paranoia with the break me break me shit is so crazy crazy
Gotta wake up gotta take some time to takes what's mine I'm first to make it
Everyday runs straight blaze me blazy
Please tell me lord get these feelings off my shoulders
I show you motha fuckas ya'll can't hold us
Two of dogs behind bars I left the scars
Hopin that his soul would not be intoxicated but I'm sayin that in some fuckin laws
I gotta be strong I gotta move on
Losin my backs protected by laws not for share to see one
Note to my family and those who roll with me

Turnaround, every now and then I get a
Little bit lonely and you're never coming around
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a
Little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a
Little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by

I knew that it was love at first sight but too forbidden to be right
I saw it in her eyes she needed a man like me in her life
But first you try to hide it as your heart is beatin
You had some thoughts of cheatin but you resisted the temptation
The situation was this girl knew how to treat a man
Soft as sand so slim and so tan sincerely the most perfect body
Everyone told me to touch another mans girl is the biggest sin but I couldn't stop kissin that soft skin
I had to wear this girls hand at the thought my heart would fall in love again
I was a playa in this game heart swellin up with pain
But that all changed I knew you were gone be my soon
Late night callin my cell phone when yo man was sleepin in the other room
You don't deserve to cry I want to be the one to make you smile all the time
But I was too focused on gettin mine
In the end we got lost faith played the biggest trick on us
It was him, me, and you left stuck with three hearts crushed

Turnaround, every now and then I get a
(Yeah, we came a long way man can't break this shit now)
Little bit lonely and you're never coming around
(L.E.O.P.A God bless the child with peaceful eyes)
