Can't nobody fuck with you
I'm an animal, I should be kept inside a fuckin' zoo
You a bitch, your bitch told me she was stuck with you
Fuck around with me will get you beat like a production crew
I'm Vinnie Paz cousin, who the fuck is you
Gun brawl, hand to hand, cousin I will muscle you
I used to ride pussy boi for a buck or two
Now I hit you with the lama, bodybag duffle you
Yeah, I do the type of shit that a thug would do
You the type to be in magazines with men huggin' you
That's the type of shit that have me snuffin' you
Pull the ratchet out and put a slug inside your bubble goose
I find your kind of rhyme to be insufferible
Put your body in a place where nobody discover you
Bring your whole team, all them faggots sucka too
Peace to Afu, brotha I'd spill they blood for you
