An innocent man becomes a target of insanity as he steps into the crosshairs of a homicidal maniac with a need for revenge. Join us for a journey into the dark endless cabins of a sick and twisted man. Join us for a journey into living hell.

[Doap Nixon:]
I feel lightning in my fingertips
Swiff status, I give a nigga his wings bitch
Sleep on me, creep on me
Throw heat on me and I'm still gonna eat homie
I'll Bill from La Coka Nostra
Come sideways and we'll both? ya
Reef got the toaster, all I gotta do is whistle
And my bitches will smoke ya
What more can an underground rapper say?
How longer is these rappers gonna shine gay?
First up is Ye (Kanye), second and third is Ye and my shit get no play
Where I'm from yo the jakes'll murk ya
Act like you know and the fiends'll jerk ya
Three classics under my belt
I just lost my comrade, I need something to melt

[Reef The Lost Cauze:]
You think you BIG or Tupac, you Nosferatu
Ferragamos, murder, death, kill, ammo
There's no tomorrow, you won't see the evening news
Rolling? goose spend your time like Beetlejuice
We the truth, you talking about the cat you hit
Vicious as the blackened spears and sleep for half a year
You only bust your gat in air
Yeah you killing the clouds, having shootouts with the atmosphere
You the wackest here, unable for my rap to fear
You live fairy tales like glass slippers and magic mirrors
Who's the fairest? Speak the language of Arabs
Sharif terror, send em to the sky like a chair lift
I'm original, never jocking y'all style
I steel a nigga, watch him slide like crocodile mile
I'm the wild child style vile since wild style
My guns go boom boom, your guns go pow pow

Deadly sins, we ain't gonna pray for em
I'll Bill and Reef, I'm a spray for em
Five niggas that's the best in the game
If the niggas ain't fam then they feeling the flame

Deadly sins, we ain't gonna pray for em
King Mag and Paz, I'm a spray for em
Five niggas that's the best in the game
If the niggas ain't fam then they feeling the flame

[King Magnetic:]
It's the heavy metal king, ain't talking about the group though
Cause I'll beat a gun charge right through the loop hole
Still down to shoot though, use em accordingly
They supported me, protected what my music afforded me
Disorderly, hold your beef, do them shits grimy
Literally down with Doap since the mid-90s
That's right, face cringe from the syringe binge
And friends bend every rule that you made within
Aim and spray again, nothing like a window cleaner
Talk politics up close and no leader
And for the front of your eyes is binoculars
You need to stop in the apocalypse to rock with us
If not it's AZ about to rock it up
Doing open heart surgery on your esophagus
I'm a die profitless like cult leaders
Aim assault heaters at adult, leaders gonna bolt

[Ill Bill:]
The game of thrones, stick you for your chains and clothes
Most rappers will suck dick for cocaine and dro
Ratchets explode, homie my chrome'll rape your soul
Bring twelve plagues like Moses raining toads
Fuck your tongue wanted the blood
Hit you in the head with an audible guns
Unfortunate ones get tortured and hung
The cult leader homie with the sorcerer's tongue
Heavy Metal King influence your daughters and sons
You the topic of the song Shook Ones from Mobb Deep
I'm harder than bricks or football on concrete
Chilling in deadstock Jordans, millions of dead cops
Warnings, COs, informants
A hip hop Blackie Lawless, see more bodies than coroners
Unfamiliar aura, peel off shotties at foreigners
Grinning with pride, gorillas with militant minds
You win or you die, I'll empty the clip in your eye

Deadly sins, we ain't gonna pray for em
I'll Bill and Reef, I'm a spray for em
Five niggas that's the best in the game
If the niggas ain't fam then they feeling the flame

Deadly sins, we ain't gonna pray for em
King Mag and Paz, I'm a spray for em
Five niggas that's the best in the game
If the niggas ain't fam then they feeling the flame

[Vinnie Paz:]
There's no ode to the goat, throw his body in the moat
Bucky fifty to windpipe, go for the throat
Pussy boy rappers better hold rosary close
Ain't too many in my cypher that's closer than Doap
Throw the faggot in the water, I hope that he float
Hope they ready for the slaughter, it's awfully close
I think he wanna kill himself I offer him rope
My vision is blurry, I'm singing Allah through a scope
Boxcutter Paz John the Baptist
Ain't nobody safe when I bomb you bastards
Only thing I think about is Lam and gat clips
Jordans, Grey Goose, bitches, and caskets
I'm an ugly motherfucker, give me a fat bitch
A dime is too much work, Vinnie is savage
Rob a motherfucker, rip through his assets
The 28 V rip through your cabbage

Yeah,
