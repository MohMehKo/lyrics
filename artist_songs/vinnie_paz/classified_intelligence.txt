Yeah, this is Vinnie Paz. Big Louie Dogs. Vin Laden.

[Vinnie Paz:]
Obama's a fraud, every action is opposite God
Line 'em up guillotine, then chop with the sword
Anyone who got murked, then I was the cause
Who the one who got hurt and died on the cross
Not the Jesus that they told you that died
He escaped and he hid inside a hole and survived
Fuck the pope, he a nazi and I hope that he die
I hope that none of y'all listen to his holiness lies, yeah
I hope that y'all never trap with the beast
I hope that y'all don't have to ever see the savage's teeth
They look for flesh and see a ravenous feast
I was beasting mothafuckers for they Lazarus piece, yeah
I told y'all about my son in a box
I told y'all never talk and to run from the cops
I told y'all 'bout the jums and the pots
The C.I.A. killed Kennedy and put the jums on the blocks
