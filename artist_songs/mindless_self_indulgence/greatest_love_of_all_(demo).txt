I believe the children are the future,
Teach them well, and make them see the way
Show them all the beauty they possess insi-hi-ide

Give them a sense!
Of pride!
To make it easier

Let the children's laugh!
-Ter!
Remind us how we used to be

I decided long ago,
Never to walk in anyone's shadow,
If I fail,
If I succeed,
At least I live as I believe,
It don't matter what they take from me,
They can't take my dig...ni.........ty! (because the grea...)

...test, love of all,
It's inside of me,
Me,
Me, me,
Me

I found the grea...test, love of all,
And it is happening to me...

Everybody's searchin' for a hero,
Someone to, look up to,
I never found anybody who will fill the needs
A fucked up place...to be,
So I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago,
Never to walk in anyone's shadow,
If I fail,
If I succeed,
At least I live as I believe,
It don't matter what they take from me,
They can't take my dig...ni.........ty! (because the grea...)

...test, love of all,
And then he do what shame,
Shame,
Shame, shame,
Shame
You know that lure, in,
Into all yourself,
That is the greatest love of all

Bobby, Bobby, Bobby
Buh...Buh, Buh, Buh, Bobby, Boh,
Buh, Buh, Buh, Buh, Bobby,
Buh, Buh, Buh, Buh, Bobby, Boh,

If I fail,
If I succeed,
At least I live as I believe,
It don't matter what they take from me,
They can't take my dig...ni.........ty! (because the grea...)

...test, love of all,
Is inside of me,
Me,
Me, me,
Me

I found the grea...test, love of all,
And it is happening to me...
