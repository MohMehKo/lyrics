The bass, the rock
The mic, the treble
I like my coffee black
Just like my metal

The bass, the rock
The mic, the treble
I like my coffee black
Just like my metal

I can't wait for you to knock me up
In a minute, minute
In a fuckin' minute

I can't wait for you to knock me up
In a minute, minute
In a second

I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like bad ass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up

I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like bad ass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up

I don't find it funny right now (right now)
Just want my ma-ma-ma-money right now (now)
I'm on my way to the party right now (right now)

Because the break, the break, the break
