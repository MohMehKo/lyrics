Night falls
In the dream
You are falling
As dark lightens
(So much blood)

Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh,
Yeah, yeah

Oh, God I'm beautiful
Oh, God I'm wonderful
I'm marvelous, intelligent,
So why doesn't that make me feel better?
I need some more
I need someone who's insecure
I don't care who you are
(Controlling you makes me better)

This hurts me more than
It will ever hurt you
This hurts me more than
It will ever hurt you

(I struck her face until it ran blood)

This will hurt you
This will help me
Help me hurt you!

Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh
Yeah, yeah

Oh, God I can't exist
I need someone meaningless
To justify my existence
Fucking you will keep me alive
But it never does
And that's the way it always was
Lovely ladies, maids of honor
(Fucking you will make me stronger)

This hurts me more than
It will ever hurt you
This hurts me more than
It will
This will help me
Help me hurt you

Oh God, I'm beautiful
Oh, God I'm wonderful
I'm marvellous, intelligent
So why doesn't that make me feel better?
(Fucking you will make me stronger)

This will help me
This will hurt you

(Fucking you will make me stronger)

This will help me
Help me hurt you

(Hurt me)
