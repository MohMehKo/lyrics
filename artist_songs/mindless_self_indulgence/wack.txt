I wonder when it's going to stop being fun for me [x3]
Five fucking seconds from now
I really need to quit before it all turns to shit [x3]
Too fucking late for that

They say my first CD was my best one
And that other shit was disappointing at best

Me likes watching it go down in flames
Not my fault
I blame it on the industry
Rock my hole
Well since you put it that a way
They were right
My shit is wack
Down to defy niggaz
And my double wide niggaz
My shit is wack

I wonder when I'll really stop being good at this [x3]
Was I ever good at this?
I know its shit but it is something I won't admit [x3]
Too fucking bad for you

Oooooooooooh!
(Down to defy niggas and my double-wide niggas)
Oooooooooooh!
(Down to defy niggas and my double-wide niggas)
Oooooooooooh!

Me likes watching it go down in flames
Not my fault!
I blame it on the industry
Rock my hole!
Well since you put it that a-way
They were right!
My shit is wack!(Oh-woah, Oh-woah)
My shit is wack! (Oh-woah, Oh-woah)
Down to defy niggas and my double-wide niggas
Oh-woah, oh-woah!
My shit is wack!
Oh-woah, oh-woah!
Down to defy niggas and my double-wide niggas
Suicide!
