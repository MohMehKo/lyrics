Anti-drugsters be sucking up as long as I'm belligerent
Shootout over tickets for me
Injure to the fuckups
Porno-ography makes me go hyper
From internet to peepshow
I will never find our freakin' diapers

Let's go to the mall
Pick up some kids
Spread some diseases
Cause I got the balls
All of them knew
Most people with nuts
Don't know how to squeeze them

I hate metal, I know better
I take chances, I know better
I loose money, I know better
I'm so screwed cause I'm no better

Adios amigos, no estas usted
Adios amigos, no es bueno

Don't they, Don't they teach you sucka
Your pants on fire
I'm a little perfect than you
I will never retire
But you sample every music
Then you added nothing, nothing to it (now I do it too)
and now we all will have to suffer through it

Let's go to the mall
Pick up some kids
Spread some diseases
Cause I got the balls
All of them knew
Most people with nuts
Don't know how to squeeze them

I hate metal, I know better
I take chances, I know better
I loose money, I know better
I'm so screwed cause I'm no better

Adios amigos, no estas usted
Adios amigos, no es bueno

Don't call me Daddy
Don't call me Daddy

Let's go to the mall
Pick up some kids
Spread some diseases
Cause I got the balls
All of them knew
Most people with nuts
Don't know how to squeeze them

I hate metal, I know better
I take chances, I know better
I loose money, I know better
I'm so screwed 'cause...

Don't call me Daddy
Don't call me Daddy
