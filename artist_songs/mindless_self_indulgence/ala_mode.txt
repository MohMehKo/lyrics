I like my girls like my women
And my women like my girls
With ice cream on their ass
And my dick in their world
I ain’t fuckin’ around
I’m serious as school teachers
I got 31 flavors to make you a believer, baby

Want it, need it, à la mode
Serve that shit fucking cold
I can’t stand it when it’s all alone
‘Cause everything is better when it’s à la mode

When you gang bang and take money from banks
You only have yourself and your fucking guns to thank
And when you’re popped, locked, stopped and arrested by the cops
You can make it fuckin’ better with some ice cream on the top now, baby

Want it, need it, à la mode
Serve that shit fucking cold
I can’t stand it when it’s all alone
‘Cause everything is better when it’s à la mode

(Coffee
Candy
Pistachio nut
Burgundy
Cherry
Butterscotch
Chocolate chip
Lemon crisp
French vanilla with a peppermint twist)

You’re going to jail? Ice cream will fix it
You don’t have a life? Ice cream will fix it
You make bad decisions? Ice cream will fix it
You don’t have a job? Ice cream will fix it
You can’t find love? Ice cream will fix it
You’re a failure? Ice cream will fix it
Everyone hates you? Ice cream will fix it
Everyone hates you
(I want sprinkles on that shit)

Want it, need it, à la mode
Serve that shit fucking cold
I can’t stand it when it’s all alone
‘Cause everything is better when it’s à la mode
