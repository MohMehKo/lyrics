I don't know what's wrong with me
But I know why you make fun of me

I don't know what's wrong with me
But I know why you make fun, make fun!

I don't know what's wrong with me
But I know why you make fun of me 
[x2]

Don't know what it was, don't know what it was
I don't know what it was, don't know what it was
[x2]

All of you inside of me [x3]

You will see just what I see
You will see it, I will make you (hey!)
You will see it, I will make you

I don't know what's wrong with me
But I know why you make fun of me

I don't know what's wrong with me
But I know why you make fun, make fun!

I don't know what's wrong with me
But I know why you make fun of me 
[x2]

Don't know what it was, don't know what it was
I don't know what it was, don't know what it was
[x2]

All of you inside of me [x3]

You will see just what I see
You will see it, I will make you (hey!)
You will see it, I will make you
