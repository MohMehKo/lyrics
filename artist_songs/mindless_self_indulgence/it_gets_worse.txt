Hey
You
Baby
You don't know how bad it's going to get
If you think shit sucks now
You ain't seen nothing yet
Because it doesn't get better, unless you're pretty
It doesn't get better, unless you've got money
It doesn't get better, so just give up
It never gets better, no
It gets worse

Oh oh oh oh
You're gonna die alone
Oh oh oh shit yeah
It gets worse

Now I'm no psychiatrist
I'm no doctor with no degrees
But it don't take no fuckin' scientist to figure out that there is nothing in this world for me
Because it doesn't get better, unless you're pretty
It doesn't get better, unless you've got money
It doesn't get better, so listen the fuck up
It never gets better, no
It gets worse

Oh oh oh oh
You're gonna die alone
Oh oh oh shit yeah
It gets worse

You're going down the road that's the same one that we have
We cannot wait to watch life kick you in your ass
I shed a little tear for all of you out there
There's no way to escape [x2]
Welcome to hell [x6]

Because it doesn't get better, unless you're pretty
It doesn't get better, unless you've got money
It doesn't get better, so just give up
It never gets better, no
It gets worse
So long cruel world
Oh oh oh shit yeah
It gets worse
