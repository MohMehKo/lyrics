Goodbye 1989
I wanna be the one in control
Rock my white shoes, polo tie
The next big thing for five years running

It's not your turn
It's not your turn yet

Back off you little shits
Gnawing at my fists
I see they breed you by the boatload

Back off you little whores
Get 'em on all fours
And let me beat you to the fucking punch bowl

My body's not even cold
My act is just getting old

We eat what we like
