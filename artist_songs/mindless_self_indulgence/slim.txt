You are my reason for living

Fucking myself is my main excuse
For getting bruised and avoiding you
It's my own fault that I tied the noose
'Cause I cannot love what I want to abuse

Ooh, ooh, ooh me in this
Old dream and this old me
In this ahh this ahh all this ahh all ahh
(ah ah ah ah)

I screwed you to love myself
Who I was was who felt me up
It's my own fault that I tied the noose
'Cause I cannot love what I want to abuse

Ooh, ooh, ooh me in this
Old dream and this old me
In this ahh this ahh all this ahh all ahh
(ah ah ah ah)
