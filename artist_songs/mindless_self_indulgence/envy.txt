My children, I had to know
Does this taste like Hell?

Don't you know what you do unto me?

Oh, I envy you the most
What you must be feeling

Oh, I envy you the most
This must be me dreaming

Oh, I envy you the most
Once you stop breathing

...

Oh, I envy you the most
What you must be feeling

Oh, I envy you the most
This must be me dreaming

Oh, I envy you the most
Once you stop breathing

Save your, save your soul. 
Save your, save your soul. 
Save your, save your soul. 
Save your, save your soul. 

PLEASE FORGIVE ME
PLEASE FORGIVE ME
PLEASE FORGIVE ME
PLEASE FORGIVE ME
PLEASE FORGIVE ME
PLEASE FORGIVE ME
PLEASE FORGIVE ME
PLEASE FORGIVE ME

Oh, I envy you the most
What you must be feeling

What you must be feeling
What you must be feeling

All my children
All my children

PLEASE FORGIVE ME
PLEASE FORGIVE ME
PLEASE FORGIVE ME
PLEASE FORGIVE ME
