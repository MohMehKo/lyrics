Oh!

Sweet ignorant bliss
I wish
I could kiss
You right on
The fucking mouth

Because I want to forget
Oh yes, I need to forget
That nothing good
Could ever happen
When I trust people

Because no one is perfect
Because the world isn't perfect
And it will never be perfect
And that's perfect

You have to live this life
To sing this song
Let's go!

Why. Don't. You. Come. Here. And. Prove. Me. Wrong?

Why don't you come here
And try to prove me wrong?
'Cause I am a stupid boy
And you are a stupid girl

Why don't you come here
And take me on?

I. Don't. Make. Rules.
I. Just. Break. Rules.

I. Don't. Make. Love.
I. Just.

Oh!

I have seen the price of failure
And it is always high

And looking back on my life
I would have liked it if society
Had gone through the trouble
Of protecting you from me

The only assurance I have
Is my own two hands
The only insurance I have
Is my stupid fans

You have to live this life
To sing this song
Let's go!

Why. Don't. You. Come. Here. And. Prove. Me. Wrong?

Why don't you come here
And try to prove me wrong?
'Cause I am a stupid boy
And you are a stupid girl

Why don't you come here
And take me on?

I. Don't. Make. Rules.
I. Just. Break. Rules.

I. Don't. Make. Love.
We. Just.

Why don't you come here
And try to prove me wrong?
'Cause I am a sexy boy!

Why don't you come here
And try to prove me wrong?
'Cause I am a sexy girl!

Why don't you come here
And try to lead me on?
'Cause I am a stupid boy!

Why don't you come here
And try to play along?
'Cause I am a stupid girl!

Why don't you come here
And try to prove me wrong?
'Cause I am a sexy girl!

Why don't you come here
And try to turn me on?
'Cause I am a stupid boy!

Why don't you come here
And try to play along?
'Cause I am a sexy boy!

Why don't you come here
And try to prove me wrong?
'Cause I am a stupid boy!

Why don't you come here
And try to turn me on?
'Cause I am a stupid boy!
