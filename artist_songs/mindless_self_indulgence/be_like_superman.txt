Like you know I should, like you know I would
Like you know I might, 'cause you know I'm right
Like you know I will, 'cause you know I'm ill
Like you know I can, 'cause I'm superman!

(I said)
God god
Oh god god
Oh god god
Goddamn
[3x]

[spoken:] I'm gonna make two things very clear to you right now...

Oh wouldn’t we like to know
Lord, have mercy on my soul
I don't need to play another show
I don't give a shit about the money
[2x]

Money, money, money, money...

(I said)
God god
Oh god god
Oh god god
Goddamn
[3x]

[spoken:] I'm gonna make two things very clear to you right now...

Oh wouldn’t we like to know
Lord, have mercy on my soul
I don't need to play another show
I don't give a shit about the money
[2x]

They think I'm from another galaxy
And that's why they all want to kill me
They think I'm from another galaxy
And that's why they don't understand me
[2x]
Galaxy, galaxy, galaxy...

Like you know I should, like you know I would
Like you know I might, 'cause you know I'm right
Like you know I will, 'cause you know I'm ill
Like you know I can, 'cause I'm superman!
[2x]

(JUST LIKE THIS!)

(I said)
God god
Oh god god
Oh god god
Goddamn
[3x]

[spoken:] I'm gonna make two things very clear to you right now...

Oh wouldn’t we like to know
Lord, have mercy on my soul
I don't need to play another show
I don't give a shit about the money
Money, money, money, money...
