[Spoken:] The deeper you go, the better you feel, and better you feel, the deeper you go

This will seem like a memory of Heavens
Like a memory of Heaven [x3]
(Baby!)
This will seem like a memory of Heaven
Like a memory of Heaven [x2]

This will seem like a memory of Heaven
Like a memory of Heaven [x3]
(Baby!)
This will seem like a memory of Heaven
Like a memory of Heaven [x2]

There's no santa clause
No toothfairy
And no easter bunny 

This will seem like a memory of Heaven
Like a memory of Heaven [x2]
(Baby!)
This will seem like a memory of Heaven
Like a memory of Heaven [x2]

There's no superman
No unicorns
And no easter bunnies!

This will seem like a memory of Heaven

[Spoken:] The deeper you go, the better you feel, and the better you feel, the deeper you go
