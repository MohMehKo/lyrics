I know I'll feel this way forever
I know no one will beg to differ
Goodbye, so long, it's been a pleasure

Repeat this when I say that
I don't want you to hate me, I want you to want to hate me
I don't want you to date me, I want you to want to date me

I wanna pay for it, all this shit
I wanna pay for it like a god damn son of a bitch

Never gonna be perfect
(No, never gonna be, never good enough, not for me)
I know I'll feel this way forever
(No, never gonna be, never good enough, not for me)
I know no one will beg to differ

Repeat this when I say that
I don't want you to hate me, I want you to want to hate me
I don't want you to date me, I want you to want to date me

I wanna pay for it, all this shit
I wanna pay for it like a god damn son of a bitch
I wanna pay for it, all this shit
I wanna pay for it like a god damn son of a bitch

Never gonna be perfect
(No, never gonna be, never good enough, not for me)
I know I'll feel this way forever
(No, never gonna be, never good enough, not for me)
I know no one will beg to differ

Too much of one thing never hurt me, baby
It is aggressive, that's the message we send

I don't want you to hate me, I want you to want to hate me
I don't want you to date me, I want you to want to date me

I wanna pay for it, all this shit
I wanna pay for it like a god damn son of a bitch
I wanna pay for it, all this shit
I wanna pay for it like a god damn son of a bitch
