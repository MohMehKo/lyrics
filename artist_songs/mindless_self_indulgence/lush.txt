Everything I touch it falls apart
And I am left with nothing
Everything I touch it turns to total garbage and I can't win

And I don't know why

And now I'm messing with the ritual
And now I'm messing with the ritual
And now I'm messing with the ritual
And now I'm messing with the ritual

Everything I touch it falls apart
And I am left with nothing
Everything I touch it turns to total garbage and I can't win

I want to plead
I'm watching everything
I aims to pleaaaaaaaaase

And I don't know why

Messing with the bits
Messing with the rest
Messing with the bet you are messing with bitch
Oh now, messing with the ritual
Messing with it
Oh now, messing with the ritual
Messing with bitch
Oh now, messing with the ritual
Messing with bitch
Oh now, messing with the rest
