I was doing just fine
'Til the son of God had saved me, now
And I sin all of the time
Living life begging forgiveness

Sweet religion
Blood is spilling, blood is spilling
Sweet religion
Persecute the weak and willing
I've been here so long
For the love of God

(Come here, I got somethin' to tell you, Jesus!)

My flesh is so weak
And my spirit is not so willing, baby
Turn the other cheek
And I'll spank you right on your ass, baby

Sweet religion
Help me, Satan! Help me, Satan!
Sweet religion
Drag me down into your basement
I've done nothing wrong
For the love of God

Sweet religion
Blood is spilling, blood is spilling
Sweet religion
Help me, Satan! Help me, Satan!
I've been here so long
For the love of God
