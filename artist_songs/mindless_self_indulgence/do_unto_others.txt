Everyday I ask why
You were picked to be Jesus Christ
It could've been me
It should've been me
Up on the cross
Tellin' you all..

Do unto others as you would have them do unto yourself
You did it unto me and now I'm doin' it unto you
[x2]

It must have been some mistake
I'm not the one who should be saved
My divinity has been denied
Mary and me were both fucked by God

Do unto others as you would have them do unto yourself
You did it unto me and now I'm doin' it unto you
[x2]

You did it unto me and now I'm doin' it unto you
[x4]

Do unto others as you would have them do unto yourself
...and now I'm doin' it unto you
[x2]

You did it unto me
And now I'm doin' it unto you
You did this unto me
And now I'm doin' this unto you
You did this unto me
And now I'm doin' this unto you
You did this unto me
And now I'm doin' it unto you
You did this unto me
And now I'm doin' it unto you
You did this unto me
And now I'm doin' it unto you
You did this unto me
And now I'm doin' it unto you

You did this unto me
[x6]
