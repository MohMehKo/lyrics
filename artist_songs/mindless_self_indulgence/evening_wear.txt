This is my vindication
With a little decoration
No need to keep you waitin' (nahnahnahnah)
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-bap)
Be intimidated
By what we have created
Kiss underneath the radaaaaaaaaar
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-bap)
I got myself a fuckin' life
Dressed up in evening wear
I dress myself in fuckin' lies
I don't care
Make-up won't help me oblige too much
It's not faaa-air
To be compared to you-ou-ou [x2]
To be compared to
(You-ou-ou bap-bap-bada-bap)
(Be-be-be ba-ba-bada-ba)
(You-ou-ou bap-bap-bada-bap)
(Be-be-be bap-ba-ba-ba-da-da-da)

Just call me "Mr. Modest"
I got it and I flaunt it
You can applaud if you wanna (nahnahnahnah)
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-bap)
Cock-blockin' non-stoppin'
When this ass is a-rockin'
Do not come a-knockin' (nahnahnahnah)
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-bap)
I got myself a fuckin' life
Dressed up in evening wear
I dress myself in fuckin' lies
I don't care
Make-up won't help me oblige too much
It's not faaa-air
To be compared to you-ou-ou [x2]
To be compared to
(You-ou-ou baaa ba-ba-bap)
(Be-be-be ba-ba-bada-ba)
(You-ou-ou bap-bap-bada-bap)
(Be-be-be bap-bap-bada-da-bap)

Everybody wants to join the club
Once you join the club, the innocence is gone
Everybody wants to be the bomb
But once you are the bomb, the innocence is gone
Everybody wants a big ol' slice
Of a little pie, the innocence is gone
Everybody wants in [x2]
Everybody wants

I got myself a fuckin' life
Dressed up in evening wear
I dress myself in fuckin' lies
Guess what?
I don't care
Make-up won't help me oblige too much
It's not faaair
Dressed down until I disappear
But I won't do it alo-o-one
No I won't do it alo-o-one
Oh I won't do it alooone
Bap-bap-bada-da-bap
Be-be-be ba-ba-bada-ba
(You-ou-ou bap-bap-bada-bap)
(Be-be-be bap-bap-bada-da-bap)
