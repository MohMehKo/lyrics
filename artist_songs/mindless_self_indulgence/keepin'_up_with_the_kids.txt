Now, - what I wanna know is
Why don't finish your home anymore knock me up and take my funk
Cause I'm too old to be
I'm too old to be
Keepin' up with all the kids
Keepin' up with all the kids
Some, some other way
Some other place I could be real important
Now, not anymore, I'm just a bore
And you should be disappointed
Why don't finish your home anymore knock me up and take my funk
Cause I'm too old to be
I'm too old to be
Keepin' up with all the kids
Keepin' up with all the kids
Some, some other way
Some other place I could be real important
Now, not anymore, I'm just a bore
And you should be disappointed
Now, no other way but rush the stage and take away my fortune
Now - you should be King and I should be dead
And no one would be disappointed
