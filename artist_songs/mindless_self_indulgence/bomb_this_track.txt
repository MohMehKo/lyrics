Thanks for the party
And the Maserati
Y'all rocked my body
But now I'm gone', bye
Thanks for the party
The moet, the girls, the front row tickets
Yeah, goodbye
Thanks for the party
And the paparazzi
Everybody knows me
Now I'm embarrassed

Thanks for the party, the house, the girls, the press, and..
Oh yeah, doing my laundry

I want to testify
I was not notified
When did my mother start
Bugging out, getting high
I wanna take a chance
Deep in your underpants
All my little girls
Everybody kiss my ass

Bomb, bomb this track
Disrespect
No regrets
Bomb this track

All my scrawny ladies
And my bony ladies
That's what happens when you take what they is givin', baby

All my horny mommies
And my rowdy mommies
Pop'n shtatic yo prepare yourself for stormy weather
Good lookin' out there baby
Beefs is cookin' baby
Don't you know that they be readin' what I'm writin' baby?
All my scrawny ladies
And my bony ladies
That's what happens when you take what they is givin', baby

Thanks for the party
And the Maserati
Y'all rocked my body
But now I'm gone', bye
Thanks for the party
The moet, the girls, the front row tickets
Yeah, goodbye
