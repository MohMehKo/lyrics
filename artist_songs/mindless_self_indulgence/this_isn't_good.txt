Jingle bells
My shit smells
And I am fuckin' fake

All along
I knew better
And that was my
A first mistake

This isn't good
No, this isn't good
This isn't good
And neither is this

Please save me
A fucking spine
'Cause I gave mine away

Every note
That I deliver
Makes the sell-out
That much bigger

This isn't good
No, this isn't good
This isn't good
And neither is this

Ah, I got me big-big bone
Got me enticed by the whole contemplating
I done me raw
Me cannot hold the orgasm one be here CHA-CHING

This isn't good
No, this isn't good
This isn't good
And neither is this
