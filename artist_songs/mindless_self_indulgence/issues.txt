I'd rather fuck you than kiss you (kiss you)
But I won't press the issue
You know what I need is (I need, I need)
And you're never gonna be it (be it)
I should've hesitated
When we were inebriated
So unsophisticated (-cated)
Too late to be debated now

[Chorus:]
It's 3 A.M.
she won't put out
Let's go make out with her friends
Make out with her friends' friends
It's 3 A.M.
she won't put out
Let's go make out with her friends
MAKE OUT WITH HER FRIENDS

I want a lot of profanity
With a lot less virginity
It's a boney situation
With a wack explanation
'cause I'm on that mission
A reproductive mission
Now take my clothes off
And show me what you're made of

[Chorus]

Excuse me, do you want to screw?
Excuse me, do you want to screw?
'cause I'm so amazing in the sack
Yes, I'm so amazing in the sack

[Jimmy:] I'd rather fuck you than kiss you

I want a lot of profanity
With a lot less virginity

Now take those clothes off
And show me what you're made of

It's 3 A.M.
she won't put out

It's 3 A.M.
she won't put out
Lets go make out with her friends
Make out with her friends' friends
Make out with her friends, make out with her friends' friends [x8]
