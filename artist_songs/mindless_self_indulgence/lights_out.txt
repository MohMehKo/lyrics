Who the hell said any of you get a taste stupid?
Do you ever wanna get up all in your face?
You better take it
And nothin' you can do could make me ever go away
Fake it
Poor baby I'm gonna make it all okay

Punch your lights out
Hit the pavement
That's what I call entertainment
Causin' problems makes you famous
All the violence makes a statement
Punch your lights out
Hit the pavement
That's what I call entertainment
Causin' problems makes you famous
