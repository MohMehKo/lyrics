I love myself
I am the best
I got it made
Now you're impressed

But look what it's done to me
Is it good?
No, it's great

Well it's a little too much too late

I just dig
My own grave

Because everything is fading away, baby
Don't lose your head

Is it good? NO
Is it great? YES
Do I care? NO
Let them all eat cake

I got myself
I got my friends
I got a life
Now I'm in hell

But look what's become of me
Is it good-good-good?
No, it's great-great-great

Well it's a little too much too late

Party on
'Till the dawn

Because everything is fading away, baby
Don't lose your head

Is it good? NO
Is it great? YES
Do I care? NO
Let them all eat cake
