Last time I am stupid enough
To think that I could rock your fucking world
Last time I am stupid enough 
To think that I could rock your fucking world
It ain't like no fat motherfucker's gonna listen to me anyway
You know I'm only around here for a couple more years 
yo if I am really lucky
The last fucking time, I was stupid fucking enough
To think that little me
Could rock your fucking world
I demand my payment in cash
I demand my payment in cash
I'm doing services only I appreciate
You keep giving me bullocks
And all I want's my money
Never again, never again, never again, never again
I demand my payment in cash
I demand my payment in cash
Last time i was stupid enough
to think that I could rock your fucking world
Last time I was stupid enough
to think that I could rock your fucking world
Never again, never again, never again, never again
I learned my lesson
