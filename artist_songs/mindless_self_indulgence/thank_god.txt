In the twilight of my life 
I don't need no grammys 
Rock my gay acceptance speech 
Most of all I'd like to.. 

Thank god 
For programming my beats 
I'd like to thank god 
for making me hard like I'm from the streets 
God wrote all my dopest rhymes 
Especially the ones about shooting niggaz and 
getting fucking high 

Jesus H Muthafuckin boom boom Christ 
I been doin dis fo money and fo sex all nite 
Its the song that be gettin me erect ai-aight 
The scenario is scary yo its fukkin up your stereo 

In the twilight of my life 
I don't need no grammys

Most of all I'd like to.. 

Thank god 
For programming my beats 
I'd like to thank god 
for making me hard like I'm from the streets 
God wrote all my dopest rhymes 
Especially the ones about dealing drugs and 
rolling 
with my thugs
