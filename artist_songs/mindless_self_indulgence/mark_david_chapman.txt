Indistinguishable from one another
No possible intention to even bother
It doesn't matter what is said or how we say it
Coincidentally, we all sound exactly the same
We all want to swindle kids out of their money
If you're still doing this 'cause you believe in it

You are so fucking lame!

[Jimmy's mom speaking Spanish]
"Yo supe que nadie iba a comprender tu musica
pero tu no me hiciste caso,
yo te dije, no te vistas en color rosa"

Hey
When the world's overrun
With too many bands
Who is it time for

Mark Chapman

Hey
When they all seem absurd
He will thin out the herd
Ladies and gentleman

Mark Chapman

Now
There is no heart
There is no fear
We all just cry
The same old tear

Don't look to me
I do not lead
I'm just in front
And they're all following

Some other motherfucker
Without the balls or cojones
To take a hold of the reins
And use them

Why is something so obvious so elusive?
There is nothing on the menu that will turn abusive
I am part of the problem
Not the solution

I'm just a prisoner
In the same prison as you
We wait for other shoes to fall into positions
Already obsolete
No one will miss us at all

[Jimmy's mom speaking Spanish]
"Yo te dije, no debes de firmar con una compa√°ia de discos tan grande,
ellos no te aprecian, yo no veo en MTV"

Hey
When the world's overrun
With too many bands
Who is it time for

Mark Chapman

Hey
When they all seem absurd
He will thin out the herd
Ladies and gentleman

Mark Chapman

Now
There is no heart
There is no fear
We all just cry
The same old tear

I can not tell
Is it just me
Or do we all
Look just like

Adolph fucking Hitler
With this swoopy emo-boy dreamy haircut
Dangling in our faces
Making us all indescribably indistinguishable from each other
Or maybe I'm just another megalomaniac...

Reginald, release the hounds
