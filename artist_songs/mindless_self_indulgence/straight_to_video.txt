All aboard
Hit the road
All the bullshit
Can't be ignored

It's hard to place
In my face
No emotion

All the problems
Make me wanna go
Like a bad girl
Straight to video

Little darling
Welcome to the show
You're a failure
Played in stereo

Hiedi ho
Here we go
No solution
Strong undertow

Quite unfair
Quite a pair
No box office

All the problems
Make me wanna go
Like a bad girl
Straight to video

Little darling
Welcome to the show
You're a failure
Played in stereo

I never noticed
No, never noticed
You're so amazing
So amazing

I never noticed
No, never noticed
You're so amazing
So amazing

All aboard
Hit the road
All aboard
Here we go

All the problems
Make me wanna go
Like a bad girl
Straight to video

Little darling
Welcome to the show
You're a failure
Played in stereo

I never noticed
No, never noticed
You're so amazing
So amazing

I never said it
No, never said
You're suffocating
Suffocating

I never noticed
No, never noticed
You're beauty's fading
Fading
