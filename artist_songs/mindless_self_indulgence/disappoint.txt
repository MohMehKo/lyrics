I'm gonna dis-disappoint you
Just like I was supposed to
I'm gonna dis-disappoint you
Just like I was supposed to

I, I don't know much, I do know this
My ignorance is full of bliss
I don't know much, I do know this
That all my thoughts have turned to shit

Too far gone, the young is wasted
It's too late I can't erase it
Now it's time to impregnate it
Watch me now I'll never make it
Too far gone, the young is wasted
It's too late I can't erase it
Now it's time to impregnate it
Watch me now I'll never make it

I'm gonna dis-disappoint you
Just like I was supposed to
I'm gonna dis-disappoint you
Just like I was supposed to

I, I don't know much, I do know this
That you can kiss my floppy disk
I don't know much, I do know this
That all my thoughts have turned to shit

Too far gone, the young is wasted
It's too late I can't erase it
Now it's time to impregnate it
Watch me now I'll never make it
Too far gone, the young is wasted
It's too late I can't erase it
Now it's time to impregnate it
Watch me now I'll never make it

I'm gonna dis-disappoint you
I'm gonna dis-disappoint you

Ha!

Now my fists are burning
'Cause this is always hurting
I I I I Im fu o o o o o ock ki ki ing am m m m I f f f fucking up
Oh it's hard not-not to notice
I drink your magic potion
Oh I'm levitating
Oh I'm levitating now
Whoa oh oh

Let me tell you about the youth, baby!

Too far gone, the young is wasted
It's too late I can't erase it
Now it's time to impregnate it
Watch me now I'll never make it
Too far gone, the young is wasted
It's too late I can't erase it
Now it's time to impregnate it
Watch me now I'll never make it

I'm gonna dis-disappoint you
Just like I was supposed to
I'm gonna dis-disappoint you
Just like I was supposed to
