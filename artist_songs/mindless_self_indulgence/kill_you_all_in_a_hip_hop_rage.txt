Remember back in the day
When muthafuckas dealt drugs, shot glocks, rode jeeps had corners on lock
Wrote super dope rhymes in notebooks
Dropped ill fuckin’ James Brown samples on a hook
Bought dookie gold chains from the Fulton Mall and didn’t give a fuck ‘bout rappin’ on a pop song
You may hate me for what I say but don’t forget to page me back in the day 

Remember back in the day
When rap wasn’t gay and muthafuckas shot at each other all day
If Biggie and Tupac was alive today
They would kill you all in a hip hop rage
In a hip hop rage [x2]
They would kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill
In a hip hop rage [x2]
They would kill kill murder murder dance dance on your grave

Remember back in the day when you ran from the cops
Wilding out rolling blunts not giving a fuck
Doing business from corner pay phones
Giving shout outs to all your dead homeboys
Incarcerated rappers were all fucking famous and every ghetto was fuckin’ dangerous
Now a moment of silence for some east coast west coast violence

Remember back in the day when rap wasn’t shit and every MC was fucking legit
If Easy E was alive today he would kill you all in a hip hop rage
In a hip hop rage [x2]
He would kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill
In a hip hop rage [x2]
He would kill kill murder murder dance dance on your grave

If you a rapper and you rap about love
Throw your hands in the air so we can shoot ya
If you a rapper and you rap about clubs
Throw your hands in the air so we can abuse ya

Remember back in the day
When rap wasn’t horrible and lyrics were poetry and not fucking awful
If Old Dirty Bastard was alive today he would kill you all in a hip hop rage.
In a hip hop rage [x2]
He would kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill
In a hip hop rage [x2]
He would kill kill murder murder dance dance on your grave
