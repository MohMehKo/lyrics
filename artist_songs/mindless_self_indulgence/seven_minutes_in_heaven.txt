Oh, hey
Oh, whoa
Oh, hey
Oh, whoa
Fucking with me now
And it’s all that I have
And you’re all that I want
And if you know that I want it now
Well you can never give it up
And I’ll never get enough
Oh, whoa
I got a young naivety 
Oh, whoa
And my lust is a tidal wave
Because seven minutes in heaven 
Is all that I need when I get with him
Seven minutes in heaven 
I hope in the end that I’m not a virgin
Seven minutes in heaven 
Is all that I need when I get with him
Seven minutes in heaven 
I hope in the end that I’m not a virgin
Oh, hey
Oh, whoa
Oh, hey
Oh, whoa
Fucking with me now
And it’s all that I have
And you’re all that I want
And if you know that I want it now
Well you can never give it up
And I’ll never get enough 
Oh, whoa
I got a young naivety
Oh, whoa
And my lust is a tidal wave
Because seven minutes in heaven 
Is all that I need when I get with him
Seven minutes in heaven 
I hope in the end that I’m not a virgin
Seven minutes in heaven 
Is all that I need when I get with him
I hope in the end that I’m not a virgin
He’s touching
She’s touching
These faces
All this fun is overrated
Are you cumming (are you cumming)
To first, second, and third bases
All this kissing
French kissing
His tongue is overrated
Seven minutes in heaven 
Is all that I need when I get with him
Seven minutes in heaven 
I hope in the end that I’m not a virgin
Seven minutes 
Seven minutes
Oh, hey
Oh, whoa
Oh, hey
Oh, whoa
