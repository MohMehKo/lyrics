Everyone knows
What you know
All except me
That ain't right
Let me know
When I get
The respect that I'm due if only for tonight
Watch me mix it
In my basement
With no makeup
I feel naked now
Ha Ha Ha
I never really lost the fight
but I never really won it
Ha Ha Ha
And die my darling
Ha Ha Ha
P.S.-- Welcome to my life
