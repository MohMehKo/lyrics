After this the rest is all bullshit
After this the rest is all bullshit
After this the rest is all bullshit
After this the rest is all bullshit

I'm so down underground
I'll be scalping all my tickets
Floating up like SoundScans
Like ya'll can tell the difference

The mission fishin' for the
Disenfranchised little kids
We shoot 'em in a barrel
It's so easy when they're pissed

Under educated
Extra caffeinated
I just masturbated
Now I'm motivated

Can't live with us
You can't live without us
I take it then I break it
Then you write my paycheck

You can call me little Miss Piss with a kiss
And after all this the rest is all bullshit
And you love it, you love it
You love it, you love it

After this the rest is all bullshit
After this the rest is all bullshit
After this the rest is all bullshit
After this the rest is all bullshit

I'm bumping like a pimp on the stage to save face
I overcompensate with very bad taste
No offense, no romance, sick of your parents

I'm about to take a stance
And drop off my underpants
It's no accident
You will pay my rent

And I am free to download all the porno on the internet

Carried on a stick, stick
Not too fucking quick, quick
Now that I'm a prick, prick
Ya'll can jack my dick, dick

Say no to brains
It's a no-brainer
Lowest common
Denominator

It pays the bills
To be this sterile
Fuck me now
Rip me off later

And you love it
You love it
You love it
You love it

After this the rest is all bullshit
After this the rest is all bullshit
After this the rest is all bullshit
After this the rest is all bullshit

You can call me little Miss Piss with a kiss
You can call me little Miss Piss with a kiss
You can't live with us, you can't live without us

You can call me little Miss Piss with a kiss
You can call me little Miss Piss with a kiss
You can't live with us, you can't live without us
