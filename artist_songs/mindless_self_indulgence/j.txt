White the wall white the wall
White the wall plaster never catch on
The white wall plaster never catch on
You always have to do it with a big Long John
White the wall plaster it never catch on
We riding in pink with the walls
And the balls and the fetus
And the pink in the walls
And the bike and the fetus
And the pink in the walls
With the stripes and the pedals
Got the bike wall never catch on
