It’s written in blood
It’s written in cold blood
It’s written in blood
C c c cold blood

I’ve been watching
I’ve been waiting
In slow motion
Pages turning
I’m in focus
It is frightening
Hocus pocus
When I wrote this

Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.
For me

It’s written in blood
It’s written in cold blood
It’s written in blood
It’s written in my blood
