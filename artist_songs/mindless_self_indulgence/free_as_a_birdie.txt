Me like to go down to the Church
and drink some Holy Water,
but I don't like it... the priest don't like it,
and me can't seem to help it.

Sail away-oh, away-oh,
you live life free like a birdie,
cuz me likes to sing... me likes what me do,
and me can't seem to help it.

Me like to go under the sink
and drink some magic potion,
but the doctor don't like it... Mr. Harry don't like it,
and me can't seem to help it.

Sail away-oh, away-oh,
you live life free like a birdie,
cuz me likes to sing... me likes what me do,
and me can't seem to help it.

Me likes to go down to the park
and take them nuts from them squirrels,
but the squirrels don't like it... Mr Harry don't like it,
and me can't seem to help it.

Sail away-oh, away-oh,
you live life free like a birdie,
cuz me likes to sing... me likes what me do,
and me can't seem to help it.
