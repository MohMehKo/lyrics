No one will know
And no one will care
No one at all knows who I am
A little respect is so hard to find
But now I have put that all out of my mind
Out of my mind, out of my mind

Nothing I do
And nothing I say
Can change the fact that I am nothing
A glimmer of hope is so hard to find
But now I have put that all out of my mind
Out of my mind, out of my mind

It's all behind me now

Out of my mind
