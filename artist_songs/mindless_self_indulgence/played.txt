So happy
I have lost my edge
So happy
I have lost my edge
So happy
I have lost my edge

FUCK YOU MAN!! Don't mean nothin' anymore...
FUCK YOU MAN!! Don't mean nothin' anymore..

I played it out, out, out, out...
I played it, out out out out!

I'm big enough to make up for all that I never really did
I'm big enough to make up for all that I never really did...

So Happy
