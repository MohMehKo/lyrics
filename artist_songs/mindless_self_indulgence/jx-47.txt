Me like to go...
Down to the church...
And drinks hims holy water...
But I don't like it...
The... priest don't like it...
But me can't seem to help it.

Sail away-o... away-o...
Me live me life free like a birdie...
'cause me likes to sing...
Me likes what me do... and me can't seem to help it...

[Music Changes]
I went to the zoo and saw some monkeys...
Ooh ooh ooh ooh... ooh... ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh... ooh...
I went to the zoo and saw some monkeys today...
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ... ooh...
I saw the giraffe... but he didn't make any sounds...

[Music Changes]
Sometimes me bad...
I forgot the words, um... oooh...
We're... going on a field trip...
a field trip... a field trip...
a field trip... a field trip...
a field trip... a field trip...
a field trip... a field trip...
Mr. Laurie's gonna be there too...
Mr. Harry, he drives the big van...

[Music Changes]
Sometimes me bad, eat me dental floss...
Pull him Jesus from the cross...
Touch me thing... thing...
Somebody stole my Amy Grant records today...
I think me turned twenty two today...
And some... body gave me a present...
And me turned twenty-two today...
But they're not as pretty as Barbara Mandrell

[Music Changes]
And the milkman came...
The milkman came, and he tooks him fish...
He tooks him fish, now me cryin'... me cryin'...
Him milkman made me cry...

[Music Changes]
Then the mailman came...
Make me peepee on the floor...
Hide me sandwich in me drawers...
Uh... Hit my head against the door...
Get something to drink...

[Music Changes]
Me likes to go...
Down to the park...
And takes him nuts from him squirrels...

[Music Changes]
And... you know what time it is...
It's the closet for me... it's the closet for me...
Him so dark me cannot see...
It's the closet for me... the closet for me...
Mr. Harry says that will teach me...

No I don't wanna do the special olympics one...

[Music Changes]
My friend's... the seat on my toilet... [background whistling]
And he always seems to shout at me... [background whistling]
Ooh-hoo mister, don't you pee on me...
When I'm shitting it's a totally different story... [background whistling]
Then he doesn't seem to pay me mind... [background whistling]

He's not afraid of my... fat behind...

[Music Changes]
And on the unfortunate occasion...
When I miss the bowl and pee on him... [other singers]
Lets me off with a smile and a warning...
Don't do it again... [other singers]
