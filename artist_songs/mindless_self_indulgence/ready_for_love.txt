if y'all don't like it, just don't buy it
like you need to be told
my whole sound sucks the stereo
like you care about us
you want your money back? yo - listen up
no fucking refunds
i'm thinking i shot my load

(now i ain't get the rapping and sometimes i forget to laugh motherfucker)
all the way to the bank
i just bought my car stereo
use your money for crack
i'm still going broke and i say all this is nothing go down to the record store
buy all my records
i'm ready for love

i'm still not that cool
i'm just not that great
to suckers found out a little too late
you thought that this shit
would right fucking rock
but your friends were right
cause i fucking suck

you don't like it so don't buy it
like you need to be told
my whole sound sucks the stereo
like you care about us
you want your money back? yo - listen up
no fucking refunds
i'm ready for love

i'm not that cool
i'm just not that great
to suckers found out a little too late
