Please will you wake up, 
Open your eyes, 
It's the first day of a new life, you'll see, 
Cotton at the windows, 
Pollen as the wind blows, 
It's the first day of a new life with me, 
Soft as your skin is, 
Why so hard to let me in? 
You're the one I want to be, 

Why do you turn away? 
You are the one who asked me to stay, 
You are my home, 
You are my home, 
You are my home, 

Trailing in the train rails, 
Going where the wind blows, 
You are young, you are wild, you are free, 
Sleeping by a green lake, 
Every breath is at stake when you're the one I want to be, 

How did you forget my face? 
Oh, how did you forget my name? 
When you are my home, 
You are my home, 
You are my home, 

You are my home, 
You are my home, 
You are my love, 
You are my love, 

Trailing in the train rails, 
Blowing where the wind blows, 
You're young, you are wild, you are free.
