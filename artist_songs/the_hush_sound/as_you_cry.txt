I'm a half-hearted fool
With a heart that's broke in two
A quarter and a kiss is all
it should be worth to you

I must be the last of my kind
'cause you treasure me despite all the signs
The love has disappeared and
Darling you shouldn't even try

[Chorus:]
After every fight we always wonder what we're fighting for
Mint me up and mark me, yeah, you stole me but I am not yours
As you cry, I wanna lie
Say I love you so, darlin' even though I don't
There's no easy way to ease the pain
Roses and the tulips have withered away, they had their day
So it's time to say goodnight and goodbye

You're so bright that you shine right through
All the problems that I always try to lay on you
Won't you take me off darling?
And get some air in this rooms

I can't believe a what I can
I hold inside of my hand
Well end up partying and
Might decide to mess up the plan
I'd be a lying if I told you that we would work you

[Chorus]

Nobody's singing about you any more
You thought you heard it well you must've heard wrong
It's my business and that's alright
Don't you see that?

As you cry, I wanna lie
Say I love you so, darlin' even though I don't
There's no easy way to ease the pain
Roses and the tulips have withered away, they had their day
So it's time to say goodnight and goodbye

Goodbye...
