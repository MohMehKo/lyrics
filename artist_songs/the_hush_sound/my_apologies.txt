My apologies dear
for all my mistakes
and I'm sure to make more
'cause I forgot to enjoy the small things in life
I just let them slip by

forgive yourself cause I took pictures of everything that you've been missing
now I won't feel so bad
forget the past and repeat it all I'll take some pictures for myself no you wont feel so bad

why must I stay here
when my friends have left and waved me come with
cause I have lost all of them, they're prints in a box
when my memory stops

forgive yourself cause I took pictures of everything that you've been missing
now I won't feel so bad
forget the past and repeat it all I'll take some pictures for myself no you wont feel so bad
