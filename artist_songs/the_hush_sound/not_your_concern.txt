Shackles and chains get in the way and I'm lost in the garderner's gate
Where everything grows but no one should go where I've gone.
I won't come back
How can you dream in the doorway without ever going in?
How can you dream in the doorway...
without making excuses (and drawing conclusions) you're at it again.
I am not your concern the world will still turn
When I'm not around
Rely on me and you'll fall...backs up to the wall
Someone let me out
It's all sinkin' in, I'd probably just swim if I could but I can't so
I'm just hangin' on and on...
Just let me go you know it won't be long...before the lights are out.
How can you dream in the doorway without ever going in?
How can you dream in the doorway...
With no intention of consoling you
i was controlling you
I'm letting go of you
