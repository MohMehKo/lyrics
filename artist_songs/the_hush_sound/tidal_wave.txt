Oooh oooh [x2]

I'm feeling a fault line moving miles below my feet 
No one else is looking down except for me
A chill is running, moving down my spine
I'm walking through the fire for the first time

When we were broken, we learned how to fix ourselves
Out in the salmon foam all alone
I'll pass a [?]
slow down, slow down
We lay our shadows out on the ground

Waitin for a tidal wave that never comes
ah-ahhh, ah-ahhh [x2]
Waitin for a tidal wave to carry me home
ah-ahhh, ah-ahhh [x2]

Oooh, oooh [x2]

I can rehearse my line from start to end
It'll never ever feel real until 
I finally call action 
Wake up, wake up
I spend too long keeping up the confer [?]

Waitin for a tidal wave that never comes
ah-ahhh, ah-ahhh [x2]
Waitin for a tidal wave to carry me home
ah-ahhh, ah-ahhh [x2]

Slow down, slow down
somehow, somehow
Ahhhhhhh- ahhhhhhh

[Interlude]

Waitin for a tidal wave that never comes
ah-ahhh, ah-ahhh [x2]
Waitin for a tidal wave to carry me home
ah-ahhh, ah-ahhh [x2]

[Repeat Chorus]

Oooh, oooh [x2]
