Why do you sing to everybody but me? Why do I let it go on?
You know that you've got such a music box song in my head all day long
You fell for a girl with wild eyes, dressed in satin and lace
Oh, but she's just an empty diamond mine with a moan across her face

I can love you much better
If you can't see it you're blind
I can love you much better
Oh, you know someday I'm gonna make you mine

La la la la (la la la)
La la la la la
La la la la (la la la)
La la la la la

You are the daydream in my eyes, there whenever I wake up
But the colors never crystallize and I never get enough
Why do you kiss everybody but me? I just sit back and watch
Oh but one day soon, I'm gonna grab you by the collar
Kiss you all I want!

I can love you much better
If you can't see it, you're blind
I can love you much better
Oh you know someday, I'm gonna make you mine.

I can love you much better
If you can't see it you're blind
I can love you much better
Oh you know someday, I'm gonna make you mine

La la la la (la la la)
La la la la la
La la la la (la la la)
La la la la la

I can love you much better
If you can't see it you're blind
I can love you much better
Oh you know someday, I'm gonna make you mine

I can love you much better
If you can't see it you're blind
I can love you much better
Oh you know someday, I'm gonna make you mine

I can love you, I can love you!
I can love you all right.
I can love you much better
And you know someday, I'm gonna make you mine.
