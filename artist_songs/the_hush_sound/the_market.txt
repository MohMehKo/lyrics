Let me paint you a picture
a picture that i know that you'd like 
i'll let the colors run 
it dries and then its done 

and we'll go to the market and sell it 
its worth more to them then it is to you
you said you'd put it on the wall but i dont want you to
we'll go to the market and sell it 

let me build you a fortress 
a fortress you can decorate 
i'll find a way to pay the bills to the estate 

and we'll go to the market and sell 
it its worth more to them than it is to you 
you said you weren't happy 
and you won't be happy here 
we'll go to the market and sell it 

let me give you some money  
some money for a daring escape we'll find a ticket cheap 
say good bye and you will leave and you'll go to the market in Paris 
its worth more to them 
than it is to you
you said you won't be happy 
and you won't be happy here
