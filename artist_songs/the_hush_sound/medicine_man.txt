Medicine man, you danced me across the country
Medicine man, you danced me across the sky
Medicine man, now my feet are dragging
Medicine man, can you hear my cry?

I don't want to be
The one, the one, the one that you forget
I don't, I don't, I don't just want to be your regret
Oh oh oh oh

Medicine man, I'll lay my head in your hands
Medicine man, you will clear my mind
Medicine man, can you heal my body?
Medicine man, can you hear my cry?

I don't want to be
The one, the one, the one that you forget
I don't, I don't I don't just want to be your regret
Oh oh oh oh

I don't know where to begin
I don't know how to break the bottle I'm living in
Do any thing to take away the memory of him
Can't you see that I have no way out if you leave me now?

Medicine man, clearing my mind
Medicine man oh
Medicine man hear my cry
Medicine man oh
Medicine man you are here in my mind
Medicine man oh
Medicine man hear my cry
Medicine man oh
Medicine man, medicine man, medicine man
Oh
