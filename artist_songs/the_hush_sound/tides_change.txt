The tides changed its time to go home
The waves said I should go
The wind began to blow and the water got tall
And that's when I went home

My mind changed and then I let go
The pain said I should go
The wind began to blow and the water got tall
And that's when I went home

Going back to the boat
With fresh oars I will row
Going back to unknown
This sos will never reach the coast

The tides changed its time to go home
The waves said I should go
The wind began to blow and the water got tall
And that's when I went home
