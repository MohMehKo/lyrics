You are made of sugar, milk and molasses
So, little darlin', you attract all the bees
You are the gazer, you are the attraction
It takes a little vanity to know what it means

I know it 'cause you wrote it down a hundred times
But you say that you're doin' just fine

Say there's something better
But today, there is a cold moon rising
And you wanted something better
But tonight, tonight you're giving up

I asked a question, give me an answer
You'll say the word, and I will disappear
You're running fast, but you can run faster
Your wheels to the dirt, gonna make it clear

I know it 'cause you wrote it down a hundred times
But you say that you're doin' just fine

Say there's something better
But today, there is a cold moon rising
And you wanted something better
But tonight, you know you'll never find it

Say there's something better
But today, there is a cold moon rising
You wanted something better
But tonight, tonight you're giving darkness

And you can't hear me
I will try to draw you near me
But in the morning, you will wake up alone
When your body breaks
Even the hummingbirds will feel the earthquake
You'll sing a song of your heart's complaints

Sing it loud
Sing it clear
Oh, sing so I can hear you
Then sing it soft in my ear
Take it up
Or take out, put me down
In the grand, I'll go anywhere with you

Say there's something better
You don't see it, you won't find it
Say there's something better
You're behind it but you won't get it
La da da, la da da
La da da, la da da

Say there's something better
But today, there is a cold moon rising
And you wanted something better
But tonight, you know you'll never find it
La da da, la da da
La da da, la da da

Say there's something better
You don't see it, you won't find it
Say there's something better
You're behind it but you won't get it
