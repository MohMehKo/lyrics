Escape into the eerie night
In the dark I'm out of sight
Shadows on the alley wall
Are dancing like a lovers brawl

North south east and west
Foreign land is right and left
Don't let them see you cry
I didn't know which way was home
Ten degrees without a coat
Don't let them see you cry

I don't want to love you if love leaves me this cold
I don't want to love you if love is this alone
[x2]

Silence couldn't stop the sound
The news and gossip got around
A whisper here a whisper there
I do but don't know why I care

North south east and west
Foreign land is right and left
Don't let them see you cry
I didn't know which way was home
Ten degrees without a coat
Don't let them see you..

I don't want to love you if love leaves me this cold
I don't want to love you if love is this alone
[x2]

Eyes hang from the sockets of our faces
You said no so I don't think I can take it
This cars caving in
Rains on in the city traffic puzzle
Shifting pieces just like my stomach
Were both so upset
Love sick and sick of it
Were both on the same page
Don't feel the same way

Rains on in the city traffic puzzle
Shifting pieces just like my stomach
Were both so upset

I don't want to love you if love leaves me this cold
I don't want to love you if love is this alone
