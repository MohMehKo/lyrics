You are pretty down to your bones
You are ivory and wire and pearls
I will kiss and kiss and kiss your skin
Beg for you to let me in
But oh, sometimes it hurts
You pluck my nerves

I never wanted anyone else
Don't want anyone else but you
You are the neck
Of the bottle I'm living in
I never wanted anyone else
Don't want anyone else but you
I do adore
The hand that I've been dealt
Been dealt

I whimper, laugh, and cry
There is a murmur of your love inside
When you dress me in the dream you made
I'll be your bargain, be your favorite
But oh, sometimes it hurts
You pluck my nerves

I never wanted anyone else
Don't want anyone else but you
You are the neck
Of the bottle I'm living in
I never wanted anyone else
Don't want anyone else but you
I do adore

I do adore
The way you are
Do you adore me?
Dear, don't
Say that you don't
Do you adore
The way you are?
Do you adore me?
Don't say you won't

I wanna cry
I wanna scream
Oh, you're making me shake
Break, fall to the floor
I do adore
Do you adore
Do you adore me?

I never wanted anyone else
Don't want anyone else but you
I never wanted anyone else
Don't want anyone else

Never ever, ever want you gone
I don't
I don't want anyone else but you
Never ever, ever want you gone
I don't
I don't want anyone else but you
