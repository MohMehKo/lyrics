Facitiously fiction when Albrite was bitten 
While kissing the girl of his dreams on the lips 
When I was watching when I was clocking 
Seconds to minutes their lips locked like digits 
On safes unsafe mainly due to ticking contents 
When I was watching timer tick tocking 

Don't open the safe is unsafe 

No you won't disarm my heart 
The last gift you'll ever get from me 
Is the combination or the key 

The dial was rusted vintagely constructed 
To carry out thoughts of a small scale destruction 
I saw this one coming theres no use in running 
Safe in the distance ignorantly witnessing 
Everyone scatter as I had a vision 
A regret you might say a worry you might say 

No you won't disarm my heart
