Carousels make laps each night
Like drunks we spin until were sick
Creepy clowns from one horse towns
Can make their livings on a trick

Night covers all our tracks
To break some fragile backs
So we tell some lies
And then we hide from light

One night I fell asleep and woke up on that sunny street
At first I thought I couldn't but now I see

That the shadows kept me hidden
From the light that calls my name
All the creatures stood above me
Now I'm crawling towards the sun

Candy lips that taste to sweet
Were sour in the summer heat
As the night fell I heard church bells
Say its time to leave

Out on the town we went
To carry out missions
Neither you or I would ever know sunlight

In the night light we still shine bright
