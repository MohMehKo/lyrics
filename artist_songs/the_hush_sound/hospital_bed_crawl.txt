In the backseat of a car, in the corner of a room,
In the shadows where I hide from you
Do the hospital bed crawl, do the terminal yell
And the violently alone I feel

Well hey, you're the only thing I wouldn't change
In this place, it's strange to say
You're the only angel I ever gave away.

In an alleyway way downtown, there's a lurker making rounds
Keeping track and keeping tabs on you.
And he likes the taste of blood, and he loves the way you love
And that's just what he wants from you

Well hey, you're the only thing I wouldn't change
In this place, it's strange to say
You're the only angel I ever gave away.

I don't want your shining eyes
Darling, don' you be polite
I'm just like all the other boys
I won't take a no
I'm soaking in your cinnamon
I've taken more than I can give
Without you I'm alone, so I'll never let you go!

Well hey, you're the only thing I wouldn't change
In this place, it's strange to say
You're the only angel I ever gave away..
