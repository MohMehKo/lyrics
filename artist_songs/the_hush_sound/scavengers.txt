Trying not to blame my age 
For when I confess 
All the crowns are gettin' engaged, 
Leaving me hopeless 

Woo! 

We were so so over used 
It's a miracle, a miracle we made it through 

Tend me, tend me, 
Will you defend me? 

I was just escaping 
Scavengers 
When I gave all that I could give 
They're coming back again 
I'm always trailing 
Scavenger 
When I'm finally off the ground 
They circle back around 
Oh 

Trying not to blame the world 
But baby it's so true 
While your sleeping 
They can steal 
The bed beneath you 

Take the color from your eyes 
Take the curve out of your spine 
Take the daydream in your mind 
From right inside you 

Tend me, tend me, 
Will you defend me? 

I was just escaping 
Scavengers 
When I gave all that I could give 
They're coming back again 
I'm always trailing 
Scavenger 
When I'm finally off the ground 
They circle back around 
Ohhhh oh 

(I was just escaping scavengers) 
(Scavengers) 

I was just escaping 
Scavengers 
When I gave all that I could give, 
They're coming back again 
I'm always trailing 
Scavengers 
When I'm finally off the ground 
They circle back around 
I'm always trailing down 
Scavengers 
Still waiting for the day 
They'll find another place 
And finally fly away 
Oh
