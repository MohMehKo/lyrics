You are the dark ocean bottom
And I am the fast sinking anchor
Should I fall for you?
should i fall for you?
You are the scar on my tissue
That I show all of my new friends
Should I show you me?
should i show you me?

All we need is a little bit of momentum
Breakdown these walls that we've built around ourselves
All we need is a little bit of inertia
Breakdown and tell
breakdown and tell

That you are the rain on the fire
Deep in the trees when no one was looking
Should I speak of this?
should i speak of this?
You are a mirage in the distance
That defies the heat of the desert
Should I believe in you?
should i believe in you?

all we need is a little bit of momentum
Break down these walls that we've built around ourselves
all we need is a little bit of inertia
break down and tell
break down and tell

These rules are made to break and these walls are built to fall
These rules are made to break us

These rules are made to break and these walls are built to fall
These rules are made to break us all

all we need is a little bit of momentum
Break down these walls that we've built around ourselves
all we need is a little bit of inertia
break down and tell
break down and tell

that you are

break down and tell break down and tell [x2]

that you are
